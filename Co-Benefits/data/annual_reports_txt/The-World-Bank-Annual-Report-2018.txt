End Extreme Poverty by 2030
By reducing the share of the global population
living on less than $1.90 a day.

Boost Shared Prosperity
By increasing the incomes of the poorest
40 percent of people in every country.

These are the goals that the
World Bank has set for itself to anchor
its mission of supporting
global sustainable development.

-----------------------Page 5 End-----------------------

As developing countries face ever-more complex challenges, the World
Bank is ready to provide the support and sustainable solutions needed
to end extreme poverty, boost shared prosperity, and realize a world
with opportunities for all.

Providing critical resources.

This year, the World Bank has pur-

sued this mission with a continuing focus on providing the financing,
knowledge, and expertise to tackle the biggest challenges facing developing countries. The Bank assists countries in making the critical investments to grow their economies inclusively and sustainably; to build the
human capital needed to help people seize opportunity; and to ensure
that countries remain resilient in the face of global shocks or threats that
could undermine progress in eliminating poverty.

Working together.

The World Bank has continued to build and

deepen the partnerships required to meet these objectives—leveraging
the resources of the public and private sectors; convening influential
decision makers, foundations, and nongovernmental organizations; and
engaging with stakeholders and civil society at all levels. Built on a foundation of multilateralism, the Bank applies the best ideas and solutions
from the global community to countries’ local needs.

Delivering results. Building on the fundamental trust from its shareholders, the World Bank has made great strides in improving its operations, strengthening its processes, and maintaining its position as a global
leader in development. The Bank will continue to leverage the innovative
solutions and financial resources its clients need and to improve the ways
in which it delivers results for countries and their people.

Message from the President
It’s not an exaggeration to say that today’s challenges can seem overwhelming.
In our work around the world, we’re facing overlapping crises such as climate
change, conflict, pandemics, natural disasters, and forced displacement. We must
simultaneously help our client countries address immediate crises, build resilience
against challenges on the horizon, and make enduring investments to prepare for
an uncertain future.
But even in difficult times, I have never been more optimistic that we can
achieve our twin goals: to end extreme poverty by 2030, and to boost shared
prosperity among the poorest 40 percent around the world. Across the World Bank
Group, we are harnessing new technologies and developing financial innovations
to drive progress on the three parts of our strategy to get there: accelerate inclusive, sustainable economic growth; build resilience to shocks and threats; and help
our client countries invest in their people.
First, to accelerate inclusive, sustainable economic growth, we need a new
vision for financing development—one that helps make the global market system
work for everyone and the planet. In a world where achieving the Global Goals
will cost trillions every year, but official development assistance is stagnant in the
billions, we cannot end poverty without a fundamentally different approach.
With the adoption of the Hamburg Principles in July 2017, the G-20 endorsed
an approach that we call the Cascade, which will lead to our goal of Maximizing Finance for Development. The World Bank, IFC, and MIGA are working
more closely together to create markets and bring private sector solutions in
sectors such as infrastructure, agriculture, telecommunications, renewable energy,
and affordable housing. (Read more on page 5.)
Second, to build resilience to shocks and threats—even as we continue developing climate-smart infrastructure and improving response systems—we need
innovative financial tools to help poor countries do what wealthy ones have long
done: share the risks of crises with global capital markets. This spring, we saw
the first impact of the Pandemic Emergency Financing Facility (PEF) with a rapid
grant to support the Ebola response surge in the Democratic Republic of Congo.
With this facility—and a similar one we are developing to improve responses to
and prevent famine—we are finding new ways to help the poorest countries share
risks with financial markets, helping break the
cycle of panic and neglect that often occurs
with crises.
But resilience must start with the existential threat of climate change. When we
returned to Paris in December 2017 to celebrate the two-year anniversary of the Paris
Climate Agreement, we put more than a
dozen deals on the table to finance significant
climate action such as preventing coastal erosion in West Africa and scaling up renewable
energy worldwide. It was critical to lead by
example, and we announced that after 2019,
we will no longer finance upstream oil and gas
while helping countries find sustainable ways
to achieve their development goals.
Third, to prepare for a future where innovations will only accelerate, we must find new
	

SUPPORTING OUR CLIENTS IN PRIORIT Y AREAS

-----------------------Page 7 End-----------------------

ways to help countries invest more—and more effectively—in their people. The
jobs of the future will require specific, complex skills, and human capital will
become an increasingly valuable resource. With the Human Capital Project, which
we launched this year, we are developing a rigorous and detailed measure of
human capital in each country.
At the Annual Meetings in Indonesia in October 2018, we will unveil the
Human Capital Index, which will rank countries according to how well they are
investing in the human capital of the next generation. The ranking will put the
issue squarely in front of heads of state and finance ministers so they can accelerate investments in their people and prepare for the economy of the future.
Around the world, demand continues to rise for financing, expertise, and
innovation. The needs are great—but the costs of failure are simply too high. Our
shareholders are helping us meet that challenge with their approval of a historic
$13 billion capital increase, which will strengthen the World Bank Group’s ability
to reduce poverty, address the most critical challenges of our time, and help our
client countries—and their people—reach their highest aspirations.
This year, the World Bank Group committed nearly $67 billion in financing,
investments, and guarantees.
The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) continues
to see strong demand from clients for its services, with commitments rising to
$23 billion in fiscal 2018. Meanwhile, the International Development Association
(IDA) provided $24 billion to help the poorest countries—the largest year of IDA
commitments on record.
This year, we leveraged IDA’s strong capital base and launched the inaugural IDA bond. Investor demand for the $1.5 billion bond reached more than
$4 billion. By combining IDA’s traditional donor funding with funds raised in the
capital markets, this financial innovation will expand IDA’s ability to support the
world’s poorest countries, including efforts to prevent conflict.
The International Finance Corporation (IFC) provided more than $23 billion
in financing for private sector development this past year, including $11.7 billion
mobilized from investment partners. Of this, nearly $6.8 billion went to IDA
countries, and more than $3.7 billion was invested in areas affected by fragility,
conflict, and violence.
Marking its 30th year of operation, the Multilateral Investment Guarantee
Agency (MIGA) has become the third leading institution among the MDBs in
terms of mobilizing direct private capital to low- and middle-income countries.
This year, MIGA issued a record $5.3 billion in political risk insurance and credit
enhancement guarantees, helping finance $17.9 billion worth of projects in
developing countries. New issuances and gross outstanding exposure—at $21.2
billion this year—almost doubled as compared to fiscal 2013.
We know that the 2018 World Bank Group capital increase was a strong vote
of confidence in our staff, who work tirelessly to end poverty around the globe.
I am inspired every day by their dedication and their ability to deliver on our
ambitious commitments to meet the aspirations of the people we serve.
But we also know that the capital increase represents an enormous challenge
to operate more efficiently and effectively, to drive innovation, and to accelerate
progress toward a world that is finally free of poverty. In the year ahead, we will
step up once again to meet that challenge every day.

How a unique strategy is helping Egypt overcome its
power distress

F

our years ago, the Arab Republic of Egypt faced a serious power crisis. Hourslong power cuts affected businesses and the quality of life, while demand for

electricity exceeded supply by 20 percent. With scarce public funds needed elsewhere, Egypt needed an alternative way to find the resources needed to solve its
power problems. That’s where the World Bank Group’s emphasis on Maximizing

Finance for Development (MFD) came in.
The MFD approach is a continuation of the World Bank Group’s efforts to
mobilize resources beyond official development assistance to meet countries’
development needs. It leverages capabilities across the Bank Group institutions
to come up with innovative solutions that will help achieve the Bank Group’s twin
goals. More importantly, MFD envisages a key role for the private sector—both as
financier and a source of knowledge.
In 2014, the Egyptian government began working with the World Bank Group
to address its energy problems, bringing together local and global experts to
develop a national strategy that prioritized energy sustainability and private
sector investment. This clear articulation of policy helped attract over $30 billion
of private investment by March 2015 into Egypt’s oil and gas production and in
liquefied natural gas. In December 2015, IBRD approved the first of three programmatic loans to deliver the technical and financial support to achieve Egypt’s
energy sector reform goals, committing more than $3 billion over 2015–17.
A key part of the reform program was to leverage Egypt’s abundant supply
of sunshine. In 2015, IFC worked with the government to develop the contracts
for the Photovoltaic Solar Feed-in Tariff (FiT) Program. In 2017, IFC finalized a
$653 million debt package to finance the construction of the Benban PV Solar
Park, which will be the world’s largest when complete. Benban’s 32 solar power
plants will generate up to 752 megawatts of power, serve over 350,000 residential
customers, and generate up to 6,000 jobs during construction. MIGA has received
approval to provide up to $210 million in political risk insurance for 12 projects
within the solar park. Overall, the World Bank Group and other lenders will mobilize a total of $2 billion of private investment under the FiT program to support
1,600 megawatts of power generation.
Egypt’s energy sector is on the way to being transformed. Among other reforms,
by 2016 the Government of Egypt halved subsidies to the sector—to 3.3 percent
of GDP—while keeping electricity tariffs affordable relative to global benchmarks,
with help from the World Bank Group. The energy sector has become more efficient and financially sustainable. The government has also improved the enabling
environment for the private sector, freeing up more public resources for use in
critical social sectors.

Message from the
Executive Directors
During fiscal 2018, the Executive Directors worked closely with management to
implement the vision for the World Bank Group (WBG) as set out in the Forward
Look and presented to the Board of Governors in 2016. This discussion centered
around a capital package to enable the Bank Group to continue to engage with all
its clients while ensuring robust, sustainable financial management. The transformative financial and policy package is the largest injection of capital to the World
Bank and IFC to date, and represents a major shift in approaches to address today’s
toughest development challenges.
The Board also delivered on the ambitions set out in the Lima timeline on Voice
Reform, agreeing to a framework that rebalances shareholding in the World Bank
and more closely aligns the voting power of member countries among all World
Bank Group institutions.
To serve the world’s poorest, the Board worked with management on the
implementation of the IDA18 package to respond to complex challenges, including those related to fragility, regional integration, refugees and host communities,
crisis response, private sector mobilization, and efforts to scale up transformational
projects. At the same time, recognizing that country investment needs far surpass
available public financing, the Bank Group redoubled its efforts to mobilize private
finance through the Maximizing Finance for Development approach. The Board urged
the Bank Group institutions to better leverage synergies in working together and
with partners to attract, manage, and crowd in private investments in support of
development objectives.
The World Bank Group is uniquely positioned to tackle today’s global challenges.
The Board has emphasized its expectation that the Bank Group intensify efforts to
lead on global issues—including the promotion of global public goods and the narrowing of gender gaps—while supporting countries’ investments in the long-term
drivers of sustainable and inclusive growth. In support of these aims, the Board has
underscored the need for the Bank Group to continuously strengthen its business
model, including through simpler, more agile processes and strengthened strategic

and partnership frameworks, while still seeking internal efficiency measures to
ensure financial sustainability. The Board also supported the implementation of the
World Bank’s new Environmental and Social Framework, which will offer broader
and more systematic coverage of environmental and social risks, including issues
such as labor, land use, and resource efficiency.
To observe the direct impacts of the World Bank Group’s operational engagement in client countries, Executive Directors periodically visit project sites to discuss
the effectiveness of the Bank Group’s delivery model with government officials. This
year, Directors traveled to Colombia, Jamaica, and Nicaragua; to Burkina Faso, The
Gambia, and Nigeria; and to Belarus, Georgia, and Ukraine.

Who are the World Bank’s Executive Directors?
The 25 resident Executive Directors, representing the World Bank’s 189 member
countries, are responsible for the conduct of the general operations of the World
Bank under delegated powers from the Board of Governors. The Executive Directors
select a President, who serves as Chair of the Board. The current Board term is from
November 2016 to October 2018.

Guiding the institution
Executive Directors fulfill an important role in guiding the general operations and
strategic direction of the World Bank, and they represent member countries’ viewpoints on the Bank’s role. They consider and decide on proposals made by the
President for IBRD and IDA loans, credits, grants, and guarantees; new policies;
the administrative budget; and other operational and financial matters. They also
discuss Country Partnership Frameworks—the central tool by which management
and the Board review and guide the Bank’s engagement with client countries and
support for development programs. Moreover, Executive Directors are responsible

Structuring the Board’s work
The Board has five standing committees and one ad hoc committee. Executive
Directors serve on one or more of these committees, which help the Board to
discharge its oversight responsibilities through in-depth examinations of policies
and practices. The Executive Directors’ Steering Committee, on which all Executive
Directors serve, meets bimonthly to discuss the Board’s strategic work program.
The Board, through its committees, regularly engages on the effectiveness of the
activities of the World Bank Group with management and with the independent
Inspection Panel and the Independent Evaluation Group, which report directly to
the Board.

Message from the
Chief Executive Officer of IBRD and IDA

This was a truly historic year at the World Bank, and I am incredibly proud of what
our institution has accomplished.
We have strengthened our ability to deliver in an extremely challenging global
environment, and we go into the next year positioned as an even more valued
partner for our client countries, regardless of income level, as they work to overcome
the economic and development challenges they face.
We continue to drive the global conversation on poverty and inequality—our
core mission—looking beyond the averages to see where extreme poverty is
creeping up, due to wars, conflict, population growth, and fragility, and how we can
fight it more effectively. Our research demonstrates that equalizing opportunities
and investing in human capital are the way forward for a better world.
At the same time, emerging concerns over trade and rising debt levels loom large
for our clients and shareholders. We know from experience that trade, openness,
and solid economic management are good for growth, good for jobs, and good for
poverty reduction. Our work has therefore continued to focus on the best policies
and programs to improve the well-being of the poorest and most vulnerable,
wherever they live.
In fiscal 2018, our combined commitments for the International Bank for
Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) and the International Development
Association (IDA) totaled more than $47 billion. But these impressive numbers
stand for something much bigger. They represent our ability to confront the world’s
toughest challenges and to step in when our clients need us the most.
There were so many stand-out moments this year, but let me highlight a few.
We stepped up our support to the Caribbean after hurricanes Irma and Maria,
using every analytical and financial instrument at our disposal. This allowed us to
deploy expertise and money where it was
needed, as quickly as possible, to help
restore livelihoods, strengthen resilience,
and rebuild communities.
When the Democratic Republic of
Congo confirmed an outbreak of Ebola
in

May,

our

Pandemic

Emergency

Financing Facility was activated for
the first time to release $12 million
immediately. Along with an additional
$15 million in reallocated funds, this
helped fund the government’s response
plan in just two days, and our crisis
response platform is on alert to do more.

	

MESSAGE FROM THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF IBRD AND IDA 	

13

-----------------------Page 17 End-----------------------

We exceeded our targets for climate change, with one-third of total World Bank
lending, or nearly $16 billion dollars, going to development activities that address
climate change. This shows that our efforts to mainstream climate mitigation and
adaptation into the portfolio are paying off.
And we are leading on knowledge and thought leadership. For example, we
made a clear moral and economic case for gender equality: we reported how child
marriage curbs the potential of young women and costs developing countries
trillions of dollars; we highlighted the laws and regulations that still prevent women
around the world from participating fully and equally with men; and we calculated
that gender inequality in the workplace is costing the world $160 trillion.
This was also a successful and innovative year for IDA, including the highest-ever
first year of commitments—$24 billion—to support the world’s poorest countries.
This year also saw IDA’s inaugural bond, which received a resounding response from
the market and generated $4.6 billion in orders from high-quality investors around
the world.
The agreement we reached with our shareholders in April as part of the capital
increase has made us stronger and set new milestones for the coming years: to
improve our business model, effectively allocate resources, and do more and do
better for our clients. This means walking the talk on issues such as climate change,
gender, jobs, and fragility, but also taking a close look at the way we work and pushing our performance and productivity.
We continue to shift our resources to the front lines to deliver in areas of the
world that need us the most. The number of operations staff in the field increased
by 5 percent in fiscal 2018, and we have more staff on the ground today in fragile
and conflict-affected situations than ever before.
Working with the management team, we are taking steps to become a more innovative, impact-driven, flexible, and responsive institution. Working closely alongside
the Executive Directors, we introduced the Multiphase Programmatic Approach,
which helps us learn, adapt, and make better use of our financial resources as our
operations unfold. We approved the first program of this type: the 10-year, $200
million Madagascar Improving Nutrition Outcomes Program to tackle stunting, one
of the country’s most pressing development challenges.
Led by the President, we are doing our part to make the World Bank Group’s
Maximizing Finance for Development approach a reality. This drive to access all
sources of finance, expertise, and solutions to support developing countries will
not happen overnight. I am looking forward to this ramping up significantly in fiscal
2019, with the help of our Agile fellows and the commitment of staff across the
Bank Group to work together for our clients.
Everywhere I travel, I am struck by the difference that our work makes on the
ground for people in underserved communities, who are at risk of being left behind
by global progress. It is through the commitment of our shareholders, staff, and
clients that we will continue to be a trusted partner for countries all over the world
who are working to create a better future for their people.

For the first time in over a decade, the global economy is operating at full capacity, signaling robust economic growth. Yet despite this positive news, critical challenges remain for developing countries.
The international community is racing to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals in less than 12 years, with trillions of dollars needed to deliver on the
promise. Overlapping crises, from climate change to pandemics, natural disasters to forced displacement, threaten to erase hard-earned development gains.
And historic economic changes, in part from technological advancement and
disruption, present risks for countries, but also opportunities if they have made
the necessary investments in their people, communities, and economies to take
advantage of them.
The world needs partners that can help meet the challenges of today, while
making the investments to prepare for the challenges of tomorrow. By offering
financing, knowledge, experience, and a long-term commitment to its country
clients, the World Bank is a trusted partner for all its members to help transform
economies and advance the 2030 sustainable development agenda.
With a mission to end extreme poverty and boost shared prosperity, the World
Bank supports its client countries in three priority areas: promoting sustainable,
inclusive economic growth; investing more—and more effectively—in people;
and building resilience to fragility, shocks, and threats to the global economy.
The Bank applies this three-pronged approach across all sectors of development
so that countries make the integrated investments that can best help people lift
themselves out of poverty.

“I feel a tremendous sense of urgency, not just because there are
enormous needs in the world. Aspirations are rising. And aspirations, linked to opportunity, can breed dynamism and inclusive,
sustainable economic growth.” —JIM YONG KIM

Accelerating the energy transition
The World Bank is committed to helping countries ensure access to affordable,
reliable, and sustainable energy for all. Energy is at the heart of development,
complements investments in human capital, and makes possible the business
activity, innovations, and new industries that are the engines of jobs and growth
for entire economies.
In fiscal 2018, the World Bank helped countries adopt emerging approaches
to electricity service delivery and deploy technological innovations that have substantially increased the number of households with service in a short amount of
time. In Ethiopia, for example, a new $375 million program supports both on-grid
and off-grid efforts, with a focus on connecting schools and clinics. In Rwanda,
similar approaches have brought electricity to 1.2 million people, 80 percent of
clinics, and 90 percent of schools. In Bangladesh, long-term efforts supported
by the World Bank have brought electricity to 18.5 million people through the
deployment of a world-record 1.4 million solar home systems, creating 70,000
jobs in the process.
The World Bank portfolio in energy access—particularly off-grid programs—is
growing fast, with $500 million added in fiscal 2018 to an existing portfolio of
$1.3 billion. Also growing is the portfolio of clean energy projects, particularly
solar. Many of these projects are being delivered through innovative financial
solutions. In Argentina, an additional $250 million IBRD guarantee will facilitate
private investment to help the country to meet its goal of 20 percent renewable
energy by 2025. In India, a partnership with the State Bank of India delivered 575
megawatts in solar systems for homes and small businesses in just six months.
The World Bank is also dedicated to delivering energy services in some of
the most difficult and remote environments in the world. In Mexico, the Bank
is financing solar “farms” to deliver electricity to the 3 percent of the country
still without power—mostly indigenous people in remote, isolated areas. In the
Republic of Yemen, the World Bank is working with an existing network of microfinance institutions to deliver off-grid solar systems to rural and peri-urban areas.
Another project is improving the efficiency of electricity distribution systems and
piloting solar services in Gaza.

Supporting the move to sustainable transport
Transport is another crucial driver of economic and social development, connecting people to jobs, education, and health services; bringing opportunities for the
poor; and making economies more competitive. The Bank is helping to finance
innovative and sustainable transport infrastructure. For example, a $375 million
IBRD loan for a national waterway project is helping India to revive the Ganga
watercourse as a cheaper and greener mode of transport—water transport uses
four times less fuel per freight ton than road transport, reducing emissions—
while observing the river’s cultural importance.
To be sustainable, transport must meet four essential goals: it should be accessible for all, green, safe, and efficient. To monitor progress toward these ends, the
16

-----------------------Page 20 End-----------------------

World Bank–led Sustainable Mobility for All initiative launched the Global Mobility
Report in October 2017, the first assessment of how the transport sector performs
against these four major goals. With plans to update it every two years, the data
will enable governments to measure progress in how they provide sustainable
transport. In addition, this year the Bank signed a pioneering agreement with the
International Association of Public Transport to raise awareness of sexual harassment in public transport worldwide, with the aim of reducing the incidence of
this impediment for women’s empowerment and inclusive transport.

Revolutionizing development with digital technologies
Digital technologies promote economic growth, citizen engagement, and job
creation, driving development and transforming economies with unprecedented
speed and scale. By 2020, the increased use of digital technologies could add
$1.4 trillion to total global economic output. The digital gap remains a formidable
challenge, however, as globally more than 4 billion people remain unconnected
to the internet. In Africa, only 22 percent of people have internet access and most
are unable to pay for goods and services digitally. To help address some of the
roadblocks, the World Bank launched the Digital Economy for Africa Initiative,
which will support African governments to work with the private sector in building the foundations of the digital economy, including infrastructure, platforms,
payments, skills, and entrepreneurship.
Digital technologies are also bringing opportunities to help support development in unique ways. The World Bank is leveraging technology to develop digital
platforms and solutions that can improve public service delivery and make governments more open, effective, and accountable. In Tanzania, the Bank helped
the government use drones for geospatial mapping for flood preparedness, and
also supported the establishment of birth registration systems that provide baseline data to help target anti-stunting programs. A $317 million IDA program supported by the Identification for Development partnership (ID4D) will help build
an inclusive ID system in the Economic Community of West African States, facilitating access to services. Eighty percent of the 1 billion people without official ID
live in Africa and South Asia.

Investing in agribusiness to create inclusive growth
Food demand is projected to rise to meet a growing and more urban population, even as natural capital is depleted and climate change adversely affects
food production. This is a challenge, particularly in rural areas, where roughly 80
percent of the extreme poor live and where many of the agricultural value chain
activities—from farming to processing, trading, and distribution—take place. It is
also an opportunity. By drawing on well-sequenced reforms, public and private
sector investments, advisory services, and guarantees, the World Bank is working
to transform the agriculture sector toward climate-smart agriculture, sustainable
value chains, and more inclusive agribusiness models.
In Côte d’Ivoire, for example, the World Bank is supporting efforts to better leverage the cashew nut value chain to generate about 12,000 direct jobs,
of which 50 percent will be for women, and enhance the competitiveness and
inclusiveness of about 225,000 cashew farmers. By promoting cashew research
and seedling development, supporting extension services and technology transfers, and rehabilitating and maintaining feeder roads, World Bank support will
help increase on-farm cashew productivity and access to markets. In addition,
through a mix of interventions including dedicated financial facilities and strong
collaboration with IFC, the project will attract private investment in postharvest
and processing infrastructure to increase the volume and value addition of locally
processed cashews.

Achieving a water-secure world for all
Access to safe water and sanitation and sound management of water resources
are essential to human health, environmental sustainability, and economic prosperity. To help countries achieve the vision of a water-secure world for all, the
World Bank works with partners to ensure sustainable management of water
resources and infrastructure, strengthen institutions to expand access to quality
services, improve the financial viability of the water sector, and deliver resilient
water services to adapt to shocks and stresses. For example, a $145 million IBRD
project supported the rehabilitation and modernization of the Jinnah Barrage in
Pakistan to provide a reliable water supply for over 2.1 million acres of farmland,
benefiting about 600,000 families.
The World Bank works to upgrade water infrastructure and services in some
of the most challenging places. Despite the volatile environment, the World Bank
supported the construction of the North Gaza Wastewater Treatment Plant,
which is ready for operation. It will provide a long-term, sustainable wastewater
management solution for over 400,000 people.
In addition, the World Bank leverages its convening power to help countries
find ways to accelerate solutions to the urgent water crisis. This year, the HighLevel Panel on Water, co-convened by the Bank and the United Nations and comprising 11 heads of state and a special adviser, delivered on its two-year mandate
to champion a comprehensive, inclusive, and collaborative way of developing
water resources and improving water and sanitation–related services. The outcome package offered a new agenda and recommendations for action: rethinking how to understand, value, and manage water as a precious resource, and
catalyzing change and building partnerships to achieve the water-related goals
of the 2030 sustainable development agenda.

Managing resources effectively for long-term gain
As developing countries make the investments to grow their economies, it is
important to ensure that debt levels are sustainable and that domestic resources
are managed effectively. Good debt management is essential to economic development over the long term. As increasing indebtedness is resurfacing as a risk
across emerging and developing economies, the World Bank is working with
the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to help low-income countries achieve
their development goals without creating future debt problems. Together, the
institutions developed the Debt Sustainability Framework, a tool for countries,
multi­lateral institutions, and other creditors to assess risks to debt sustainability in
lower-income countries. This classification is used, in part, to determine the share
of grants and credits in IDA’s assistance to the country.
The World Bank also continues to support the Addis Ababa framework that
calls for greater mobilization of domestic resources to finance development
investments. To ensure that governments have a sufficient revenue base to provide basic public services and support a stronger economy, research suggests
that countries need to collect at least 15 percent of GDP in taxes. Working with
the IMF, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, and the
United Nations through the Platform for Collaboration on Tax, the Bank is developing tools and strategies for countries to increase their tax base, as well as engaging directly with governments to help ensure the quality of public expenditures.

Removing barriers to mobilize private sector financing
Finding ways to sustainably leverage private sector resources can help preserve
public financing. Through lending, diagnostics, policy dialogue, and advisory
services, the World Bank addresses public sector risks and barriers to entry for
the private sector. Bank support for financial sector, legal, regulatory, and policy
reforms is aimed at creating an enabling environment for foreign and local private sector investment. These engagements range from supporting sound fiscal

Improving private sector involvement in infrastructure

B

uilding modern, sustainable, and reliable infrastructure is critical for meeting
the rising aspirations of billions of people around the globe. The World Bank
takes an integrated approach to increasing and financing infrastructure services in
developing countries, with a view toward greater access, affordability, and sustainability. Underpinning this work is the World Bank Group’s commitment to Maximizing Finance for Development.
World Bank support to infrastructure includes helping countries build the
knowledge and capacity to design and implement quality public-private partnerships (PPPs), when appropriate. In this vein, the Bank released its Procuring
Infrastructure PPPs 2018 report, which benchmarked the regulatory framework
of 135 economies against internationally recognized good practices. In addition,
the Bank’s PPP Certification Program—which aims to enhance performance,
build capacity, and ensure global good practices among PPP practitioners—also
expanded this year with language versions in Chinese, French, and Spanish.
One major factor hindering infrastructure implementation and delivery is
the absence of good governance. This year, the World Bank—in coalition with
other multilateral development banks and development partners—spearheaded
a program of Regional Roundtables on Infrastructure Governance  to bring
together government officials, the private sector, civil society, and others to
address this core issue. Roundtables took place in Cape Town and Abidjan in
fiscal 2018 and will move to Asia and Latin America next year.
Supporting PPP project development, the Global Infrastructure Facility, a
collaboration platform that facilitates private sector investment in complex
emerging-market infrastructure projects, now boasts a strong portfolio of 38
projects, which are expected to mobilize over $30 billion in total investment.
In addition, the Bank also provides financing, which this year included support
for the preparation of the second-round RenovAr tenders in Argentina. The
$250 million IBRD guarantee complements the $480 million IBRD guarantee
provided in 2017 and together they will help Argentina unlock its renewable
energy potential by creating a market and mobilizing $5.5 billion of mostly
private investments.

policy and macroeconomic management at the country level to microeconomic
reforms to improve the ease of doing business in a country.
A $12 million IDA grant for The Gambia, for example, has led to measurable improvements in the business environment for entrepreneurs. The project
focused on the challenges faced by small businesses in two of the country’s largest industries: small-scale agriculture and tourism. The project helped establish
an online business registration system, which cut the average registration time
from 27 days to 3. By the end of the project, more than 10,000 new enterprises
had registered.
The World Bank is also collaborating with IFC to unlock access to long-term
financing in underserved markets. In the countries of the West Africa Economic
and Monetary Union (WAEMU), for example, access to affordable housing is a
growing concern. The World Bank and IFC embarked on a joint intervention
to expand the private mortgage market in WAEMU, working through the West
African regional mortgage refinance company (CRRH). IFC is providing an equity
investment of CFAF 1.2 billion ($2 million) in CRRH, while IDA financing is being
channeled into CRRH through the West African Development Bank. The IDA
package includes technical assistance to develop the enabling environment for
the construction of cheaper housing.

Creating more, better, and inclusive jobs
Jobs are key for economic and social development, and there are growing
demands for the World Bank Group’s policy and financial support, particularly
in the context of IDA18. The problems are not only related to unemployment; in
most client countries, average unemployment rates are low. Rather, it is inactivity
and underemployment that keep large numbers of households living in poverty,
as many of these jobs are in the informal sector or are low productivity activities. The three main jobs challenges most developing countries face to varying
degrees are: creating more jobs in the formal sector of the economy; increasing
the quality of informal jobs (e.g. productivity, earnings, access to social insurance,
etc.); and connecting vulnerable groups to jobs or to better jobs.
The World Bank supports developing countries in the design and implementation of integrated, multisectoral job strategies. This is achieved through
a three-prong strategy. First, Jobs Diagnostics help client countries identify key
jobs challenges at the macro, firm, and household level. The diagnostics are being
mainstreamed in the World Bank Strategic Country Diagnostics, which inform the
World Bank’s Country Partnership Frameworks. Second, the World Bank helps
mobilize global knowledge to identify solutions to common jobs challenges. Last,
the Bank supports countries implementing job strategies through lending and
investment operations and policy reforms. As of April 2018, the World Bank has
578 active jobs-related projects, representing investments of about $76 billion.
Last year, these projects reached close to 2 million new beneficiaries. In addition,
the World Bank designs monitoring and evaluation tools to standardize how jobs
outcomes are measured in projects.
In Nigeria, the State Employment and Expenditure for Results Project, with
$200 million in IDA funding, aims to enhance opportunities for employment
and access to socioeconomic services while improving public expenditure management systems in participating states. The project has employed over 16,000
youth, of whom 49 percent are young women, across four states through the
implementation of 277 sub-project contracts on road maintenance and rehabilitation and waste collection and disposal.

Reaching the goal of universal financial access
The world has made a great deal of progress on financial inclusion, but it remains
a defining challenge for development. Between 2011–17, collective efforts on
financial inclusion, including the Universal Financial Access Initiative, led to 1.2
billion new accountholders. Around the world, 69 percent of adults now have
a bank account, up from 51 percent in 2011, according to the latest Global Findex data released in April 2018. The number of unbanked adults has fallen to
1.7 billion, after accounting for population growth. Despite these global gains in
financial inclusion, the gender gap in access to finance remains persistent at 9
percentage points. Currently unbanked adults are also disproportionately poor,
young, and tend to have low educational attainment.
There are less than three years left to reach the Universal Financial Access
(UFA) 2020 goal, a vision the World Bank announced in 2013 for all adults to have
access to a transaction account. The Bank is on track to meet its UFA commitment
of enabling 1 billion new accountholders to be reached by 2020, with World Bank
Group technical assistance and financing operations currently anticipated to help
reach 738 million new accountholders. To date, 33 private sector partners across
the financial sector have signed on to help reach the UFA 2020 goal.

Preparing for the economies of the future
Disruptive technologies offer opportunities to developing countries, but only
if countries are capable of taking advantage of them. Many countries lack the
legal and regulatory frameworks and the skills and firms needed to harness
technology’s potential. The World Bank is working with governments to identify
constraints to technology-led development. The Public Expenditure Review for
Science, Technology, and Innovation, for example, is a new diagnostic tool to
help governments formulate appropriate strategies, adopt good practices, and
improve coordination of innovation policies. The tool was piloted this year in
Chile, Colombia, and Ukraine.
The World Bank report, Trouble in the Making? The Future of ManufacturingLed Development, explains how technology is changing the criteria for becoming
a desirable manufacturing location. Companies once influenced by the prospect
of inexpensive labor costs are beginning to favor locations that can better utilize
technology. Countries are urged to focus on three dimensions: competitiveness,
capabilities, and connectedness. This includes shifting from a focus on low wages
to broader considerations of the business environment, the rule of law, and the
use of technology to complete financial transactions to develop firm ecosystems;
equipping workers with new skills, building stronger firms, and developing the
necessary infrastructure to adopt new technologies; and improving logistics and
lowering trade restrictions on manufactured goods and services.
Countries will need to ensure that their economies are prepared for tomorrow’s technology. But they will also need to ensure that they are making the best
investments in their people, so that they are prepared to participate as well.

Building human capital—a project for the world
For the past 25 years, humanity has experienced huge gains through investments in people: more children are surviving their fifth birthdays and going to
school, more poor people are protected by safety nets, and there is greater life
expectancy globally. These are important gains, because building human capital
is essential for competitiveness and growth. However, the world continues to face

“We always knew that investing in people is the right thing to do;
now we’re learning that, economically, it may very well be the
smartest thing to do. . . . Investing in people is investing in
economic growth. —JIM YONG KIM

a critical human capital gap. Hundreds of millions of children and youth are not
learning enough to prepare them for jobs of the future, weak health systems are
failing to provide universal health coverage, and four out of five poor people in
low-income countries still lack access to social safety nets. Moreover, technology is
changing the very nature of work, lending further urgency to ensure that quality
investments in people and their skills are made.
To drive more and better investments in people, the World Bank’s new Human
Capital Project (HCP) will place human capital at the center of the global agenda
and Bank-client engagement, and employ the full range of World Bank services.
The HCP is developing a Human Capital Index in late 2018, which is intended to
stimulate awareness, prioritization, and action at the country level. This innovative,
international metric will reflect countries’ investments in the next generation, initially measuring survival (will children born today survive to school age?); schooling (how much will children complete and how much will they learn?); and health
(will they leave school in good health, ready for further learning and/or work?).

Securing the foundation for human capital
Investing in the first years of life is vital for economic development, given the
impact of nutrition and early stimulation on brain development and subsequent
adult productivity. The World Bank estimates that the average country would
have 7 percent more GDP per capita today if childhood stunting had been eliminated when today’s workers were children. The Bank has prioritized investment

	

23

-----------------------Page 27 End-----------------------

in the early years as critical to securing the foundation for human capital, working
closely with partners with the aim of scaling up investments in more than 30
priority countries.
For example, in Rwanda, where the government has made a public commitment to dramatically reduce stunting, the Bank has utilized $176 million
in IDA and private sector grants to support cross-sectoral investments, with
a special focus on the first 1,000 days of life. The innovative Rwanda program brings together supply-side nutrition interventions, demand-side conditional cash transfers, a focus on early childhood development, and a planned
agriculture project. The World Bank has leveraged significant resources from
the private sector through The Power of Nutrition, nearly $100 million of which
has already been programmed across IDA projects in Ethiopia, Tanzania, Côte
d’Ivoire, Madagascar, and Rwanda.

Realizing the promise of education
World Bank operations and technical work in education take an integrated
approach to creating, supporting, and enhancing education systems that deliver
learning for children, young adults, and those who need skills later in life. The Bank
is also advancing the gathering and dissemination of evidence on what works
based on rigorous impact evaluations. Shifting the emphasis in education from
inputs to outcomes is helping strengthen education systems and improve results.
The World Development Report 2018: Learning to Realize Education’s
Promise has been timely in an era of rapid economic and social change. It points
to a massive learning crisis affecting virtually all developing countries, underscoring that schooling without learning is both a wasted opportunity and a great
injustice. Learning-adjusted years of schooling—a means for interpreting the productivity of an education system—is an important new measure that has emerged
following this report. New data now show that children in low-performing countries acquire, on average, about five years less schooling than those in the highestperforming countries.
President Kim’s 2015 commitment at the World Education Forum to double
World Bank results-based financing in education from $2.5 billion to $5 billion by
2020 has been achieved in half the time, with more than $7.1 billion committed
as of June 30, 2018, signaling increasing client-country demand for stronger education systems and for the results that matter in education. The World Bank works
with countries to ensure that funds are appropriately directed and spent smartly
across regions and schools.
Ensuring that vulnerable girls can go to secondary school is another foundational investment in human capital. The World Bank has already fulfilled a key
education commitment—to invest $2.5 billion over five years in education projects directly benefiting adolescent girls. More than $4.0 billion has been invested
since 2016, three years ahead of schedule. The investments, largely concentrated
across Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, are helping provide adolescent girls
with access to quality education at the secondary level, and ensuring they remain
in school using scholarships, conditional cash transfers, and basic school facilities.
In Lebanon, for example, the Bank is working with the government to promote
equitable access to education, with a focus on girls and refugees, while in Tanzania, it is boosting girls’ enrollment by making schools affordable, reducing the
time and distance to school, and providing teacher training on ways to reduce
gender-based violence.

Pursuing universal health coverage and innovative
financing for health
Working with partners, the World Bank has focused its health investments and
research in areas that are especially vital to helping countries achieve universal
health coverage by 2030. Some of these areas include ending preventable maternal and child mortality, reducing child stunting, strengthening health systems
and health financing, ensuring pandemic preparedness and response, promoting
sexual and reproductive health and rights, and preventing and treating communicable diseases.
In December 2017, new data published by the World Bank and the World
Health Organization in the Tracking Universal Health Coverage: 2017 Global
Monitoring Report highlighted alarming gaps in the health and well-being of the
global population that have serious implications for human capital and the economic prospects of countries. Currently, half the world’s population lacks access
to essential health services. Furthermore, 800 million people spend at least 10
percent of their household budgets on health expenses. For nearly 100 million
people, these expenses are high enough to push them into extreme poverty. The
report was launched during the Universal Health Coverage Forum in Tokyo, which
was co-organized by the Bank to drive increased political commitment and accelerate progress toward universal health coverage by 2030. High-level speakers at
the Forum included World Bank Group President Jim Yong Kim, Japanese Prime
Minister Shinzo Abe, United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres, WHO
Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, and UNICEF Executive Director
Anthony Lake, as well as heads of state and ministers from over 30 countries.
Ensuring that every woman, child, and adolescent has access to health care
and nutrition is fundamental to building human capital. The Global Financing
Facility (GFF), an innovative country-driven financing platform hosted by the
World Bank Group, is working toward this goal. Linked to IDA and IBRD, it generates a large return on investment for countries. As of June 2018, 20 projects
totaling $3.3 billion in World Bank financing and supported by $452 million in
GFF Trust Fund grants have been approved by the World Bank. For example, in
Cameroon, which has one of the highest maternal mortality ratios in the world
and where under-five mortality remains extremely high in the country’s north,
the government is using the GFF to help serve neglected people and places with
increased child vaccination, maternal immunization against tetanus, family planning, and access to quality essential health and nutrition services.

Promoting universal social protection coverage to reduce
human capital gaps
Social protection systems promote human capital development from the early
years to adulthood by investing in the health and education of children, connecting people to jobs, and protecting the elderly and other vulnerable population.
By supporting families’ human capital investments while increasing household
consumption, social protections help to reduce poverty. The State of Social
Safety Nets, published by the Bank in April 2018, shows that over a third of very
poor people receiving social safety net benefits in 79 countries escaped extreme
poverty. The report helps benchmark where countries and regions stand in terms
of social safety net spending, key performance indicators, and the impact on
reducing poverty and inequality.

Investing in gender equity to ensure opportunities for all

T

he World Bank Group Gender Strategy focuses on four key areas to support
countries in achieving greater gender equality: improving human endowments which is essential to build human capital; removing barriers to women’s
ownership and control of assets; removing constraints for more and better jobs;
and enhancing women’s voice and agency.
Helping countries to remove barriers to women’s ownership and control of
productive assets such as land and housing, as well as to improve access to the
finance, technology, and insurance services needed to make assets productive,
is vital for women’s economic opportunities. Supporting these efforts, the Bank
Group launched the groundbreaking Women Entrepreneurs Finance Initiative
(We-Fi), which aims to mobilize more than $1 billion to unlock finance, markets,
and information constraints faced by women-owned small and medium enterprises in developing countries. We-Fi is an example of how the Bank Group is
mobilizing finance from the private sector and ensuring that the public-sector
tackles policy and regulatory barriers. The initiative has already catalyzed interest from banks and financial institutions in Africa, India, and Germany, who
recognize that investment in women is good for their bottom line.
The Bank is also providing project support to countries to remove such barriers. In Ethiopia, for example, the Women’s Entrepreneurship Development
Program is piloting the use of modern technologies, including psychometric
testing and data-driven algorithms, to help unlock access to formal finance for
women business owners. Psychometric testing measures characteristics such as
knowledge, skills, education, abilities, attitudes, and personality traits to predict
the likelihood that a person will pay back a loan. Women entrepreneurs who do
not have collateral are able to take an interactive test on a tablet computer that
predicts their likelihood to repay. If they score highly, they can borrow without
traditional collateral.
The Bank is also focused on increasing women’s voice and representation
in society and in key economic sectors. The IDA-financed Bihar Transformative Development Project, the second phase of rural livelihoods support in
one of India’s poorest states, fosters the development of women’s self-help
groups, which serve as an important platform for amplifying women’s voice.
Such groups are important platforms for communication and learning among
women, and have been used to drive behavioral changes in community health
and hygiene practices and to connect women with national nutrition and sanitation programs. They have also helped women from 7.5 million households to
access financial services and generate income in the farm and non-farm sectors,
with a further 4.5 million households expected to participate by 2022.
In addition to these efforts, the institution targeted constraints to more and
better jobs for women, focusing especially on reducing occupational sex segregation, enhancing skills training, improving the safety and accessibility of transport services, and providing services for
child and elder care. Efforts are also being
undertaken in fragile and conflict-affected
areas and include engaging men and boys
to tackle challenges related to child marriage, gender-based violence, and adverse
social norms.
The World Bank is leading by example
on its commitment to gender equality. For
instance, it is implementing an action plan
on recommendations received in July 2017
from the Task Force on Sexual Exploitation
and Abuse, to strengthen interventions to
reduce gender-based violence in World
Bank infrastructure operations.

THE WORLD BANK ANNUAL REPORT 2018

-----------------------Page 30 End-----------------------

The report also shows that only 45 percent of the global population are covered by social protections, while only one in five poor people have access to
social protections in the poorest countries. The World Bank is committed to supporting social protections and helping countries to develop national social protection systems to substantially cover the poor and the vulnerable by 2030. At
the seventh Ministerial Roundtable on Social Safety Nets in April 2018, ministers
of finance and economy and other officials gathered to reaffirm the importance
of social safety nets in building the resilience of poor and vulnerable households,
thereby protecting human capital.
By the end of fiscal 2018, the World Bank had 87 active social protection
and labor projects, representing investments of $15 billion. In Rwanda, for example, the Bank has supported more than 500,000 new extreme poor beneficiaries with cash transfers that promoted social protection system development and
improved investments in early childhood development, nutrition, and education,
as well as productive activities by families. In Bangladesh, the Bank supports cash
transfer programs for vulnerable populations, including the elderly, widowed, and
persons with disabilities, and is helping to expand the coverage of social protection programs to 6 million poor people by 2023.
Developing strong, inclusive economies and ensuring that all people can participate to their fullest potential will help position countries for a brighter future.
Yet severe threats to development remain, which, if not addressed, could roll back
decades of economic progress and poverty reduction gains.

Managing natural resources for current and future

Natural resources are under threat globally, from dwindling fish stocks and eroded
coastlines, to unhealthy air and degraded landscapes. The World Bank is working
with its clients to better manage land, sea, and freshwater natural resources. Pollution caused an estimated 9 million premature deaths in 2015 alone. The World
Bank is working with clients to address pollution and increasing its support for
environmental quality data and monitoring, particularly for air quality. In Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia’s capital and a heavily polluted city, the Bank’s $15 million intervention supported the installation of energy-efficient stoves and boilers, which
helped improve air quality with a 60-70 percent reduction in particulate concentration. Another Bank priority is creating sustainable ocean economies. In West
Africa, where about 42 percent of the region’s GDP is generated in coastal areas,
a new regional project is helping to build the resilience of communities that are
particularly vulnerable to the effects of poor coastal development, erosion, and frequent flooding. The $210 million West Africa Coastal Areas Resilience Investment
Project will protect against coastal erosion through a range of activities, including
fixing dunes, restoring wetlands and mangroves, replenishing beaches, and building seawalls and dikes. The projects in Mongolia and West Africa are guided by the
Bank’s safeguard policies, which address environmental and social risks.

The World Bank is also working with countries to think of wealth in terms
beyond GDP and put a value on their natural resources. A new publication, The
Changing Wealth of Nations 2018, tracked the natural wealth of 141 countries
over 20 years and recognized the contribution to the economy of assets like forests, wetlands, and agricultural land. The use of natural capital accounting puts
countries in a better position to make policy and investment choices that will
boost economic growth and support sustainable development.

Acting in the face of a changing climate
Ranked as the second warmest year on record, 2017 underscored the severe
impacts that climate change is already bringing. Floods in South Asia, severe
drought in Africa, and devastating hurricanes in the Caribbean came at an enormous cost to lives, property, and economies. As extreme events like these become
more frequent and more severe, slow-onset climate impacts such as sea level rise,
water scarcity, and crop failure are also forcing people to leave their homes in
increasing numbers. According to the World Bank report Groundswell: Preparing
for Internal Climate Migration, by 2050, more than 143 million people in SubSaharan Africa, Latin America, and South Asia could be forced to move within
their own countries in search of less vulnerable places to live.
The World Bank is continuing to support countries to meet their climate
change commitments under the Paris Agreement, actively working with countries
to help them deliver on their Nationally Determined Contributions by translating
their pledges into specific policies, and providing knowledge sharing, technical
assistance, and financing. The Bank is moving quickly toward meeting its targets
under its Climate Change Action Plan, such as its commitment to increase climate
financing to 28 percent of the Bank Group’s portfolio by 2020. In fiscal 2018, the
World Bank Group committed $20.5 billion to over 450 climate-related projects,
which accounts for 32.1 percent of the total lending volume. Since the launch of
the Climate Change Action Plan, this increased financing for climate action has
driven strong results and contributed to 18 gigawatts of new renewable energy
generation or integration in developing countries, supported 22 climate-smart
agriculture investment plans for 20 countries, and enabled 38 million people in 18
countries to have access to reliable weather data and early warning systems so that
they are prepared for and safe from natural disasters, among other investments.

Building resilience proactively into cities and societies
Resilience against global shocks and threats can be built into the structures of
cities and societies with careful planning and proactive forethought. Globally, 54
percent of the population lives in urban areas today, and by 2045, the number of
people expected to live in cities will increase by 1.5 times to 6 billion. The Bank’s
work in urban development aims to build sustainable cities and communities
through an urbanization process that is inclusive, resilient and low carbon, productive, and livable. The Bank’s City Resilience Program, for example, is an effort
to assist city governments in building greater resilience to climate and disaster
risk. The program works to provide the technical expertise or access to financing that cities sometimes lack to make the necessary and costly investments to
strengthen their urban resilience. It will achieve this by leveraging the Bank’s
expertise and assisting cities to expand access to capital. Since launching in June
2017, the program has engaged with 45 cities across the world on developing
investment programs in resilient infrastructure.

Partnering to affirm climate change commitments

T

he World Bank partners with governments, the United Nations, and the private
sector to accelerate progress in the fight against climate change. The One
Planet Summit, a collaboration between the Government of France, the United
Nations, and the World Bank, which took place in December 2017 to mark the
two-year anniversary of the signing of the Paris Agreement, was a prime example
of this.
The gathering of heads of state from more than 50 countries, UN organizations, private sector CEOs, mayors, philanthropists, and researchers called
on participants to go further in their own climate change commitments, and
provided a forum to mobilize badly needed finance for climate action. Speaking
alongside President Emmanuel Macron of France and United Nations SecretaryGeneral António Guterres, President Kim announced several new World Bank
and IFC climate commitments. Among them, the World Bank Group will report
greenhouse gas emissions from the investment projects it finances in key emissions-producing sectors, such as energy, starting in 2018. Additionally, after
2019 the World Bank Group will no longer finance upstream oil and gas, other
than in exceptional circumstances.
A key theme of the summit was the power of the private sector to fight
climate change by providing the innovation, financing, and tools required for
a transition to a low-carbon economy. Investors from top asset managers, pensions funds, insurers, and sovereign wealth funds joined the Climate Action
100+ to encourage companies to cut greenhouse gas emissions and improve
the disclosure and oversight of climate-related threats, while another 225 financial institutions made additional climate pledges.
In addition, the World Bank and its partners launched or renewed a series
of climate initiatives that aim to improve disaster resilience and advance climate action worldwide, including a new partnership to finance urban resilience
between the World Bank’s City Resilience Program and the Global Covenant of
Mayors for Climate & Energy, as well as the Africa Hydromet Program, a commitment to raise at least $100 million annually through 2024 in new, direct investments annually for hydromet modernization in 15 countries and four regional
climate centers in Africa.

Over the past decade, the Bank has emerged as the global leader in disaster
risk management (DRM), supporting client countries in assessing exposure to
hazards and addressing disaster risks. The Bank provides technical and financial
support for risk assessments, risk reduction, preparedness, financial protection,
and resilient recovery and reconstruction, and all World Bank-supported projects are now screened for climate and disaster risk to ensure that they build the
resilience of people on the ground. Over the past six years, annual World Bank
DRM investment has increased from $3.7 billion in fiscal 2012 to $5.3 billion in
fiscal 2018, or 11 percent of total Bank commitments. In providing support for
DRM, the Bank promotes a comprehensive, multisectoral approach to managing
disaster risk.
The World Bank’s social development programs are another way to help build
resilience into society. The Bank’s support spans all sectors and areas of its work,
promoting social inclusion of the poor and vulnerable by empowering people,
building cohesive and resilient societies, and making institutions accessible and
accountable to citizens. These programs are supported by analysis to make sure
Bank lending operations benefit the poor and vulnerable in the countries it
serves. In addition, the Bank continues to mainstream citizen engagement across
its portfolio of operations, and has an active portfolio of projects on community empowerment and community-driven development, an approach that gives
control over planning decisions and investment resources for local development
projects to community groups.

Building household resilience and responding to shocks
The World Bank is increasingly helping countries to develop systems for responding to crises by utilizing risk modeling and mapping, strengthening early warning systems, ensuring financial protection are in place before a shock hits, and
investing in adaptive social protection systems that ensure households are prepared for crises and social protection systems are ready to respond. Such crises
response systems allow governments to identify people who are vulnerable to
becoming poorer in the face of a shock, what their recovery needs may be, and
how to finance and deliver support to them in times of crisis. This year, the Bank
supported the sharing of experience in developing such systems through the
South-South Learning Forum on “Building Resilience through Adaptive Social
Protection.” More than 250 participants, including government officials from 68
client countries, attended the February 2018 forum.
The World Bank is supporting countries in bolstering social protection systems in challenging environments. For example, the Bank supported the Ethiopia Rural Productive Safety Net Program, which includes innovative linkages
to disaster and humanitarian responses through government-run social protection systems. The Bank is also supporting adaptive social protection systems
across the Sahel region, including the ability to scale up to respond to shocks
and climate responsive transfers in Burkina Faso. In partnership with the United
Nations, the Bank is helping Yemen to use its existing social protection systems
to help households cope with ongoing conflict there. An innovative IDA-IFC joint
project in Côte d’Ivoire is a good example of World Bank Group social protection
work in action. It is helping expand  social protection coverage by leveraging
innovations in technology. Vulnerable households are receiving cash transfer
grants from the government through mobile money technology. About 210,000
individuals from poor households have benefited from mobile money accounts
and digital cash payments.

Increasing support to fragile and conflict-affected places

P

overty and fragility are increasingly interlinked. By 2030, projections show that
between 43 and 60 percent of the world’s extreme poor will live in settings
marked by fragility, conflict, and violence (FCV), and serious risks such as violent
extremism, climate change, pandemics, and food insecurity are on the rise.
The World Bank Group is scaling up efforts to maximize its impact in FCV
situations. As a top development priority, the Bank Group is doubling resources
for FCV-affected countries to more than $14 billion under the 18th replenishment of IDA. New financing mechanisms include $2 billion to support refugees
and host communities, $2.5 billion to spur private enterprise, and a RiskMitigation Regime that supports proactive initiatives to help countries mitigate fragility risks. Efforts this fiscal year focused on quickly operationalizing these new windows. For the IDA18 Refugee Sub-Window, eligibility was
established for nine countries that collectively host more than 62 percent of
refugees located in IDA and IBRD/IDA blend countries. Cameroon became the
first country to benefit from the window, with the approval of $130 million
in grants in May 2018 to help provide refugees and host communities with
access to health care, education, social safety nets, and social and economic
infrastructure. The Bank is also helping to address the needs of Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh through an additional $50 million supported in part by
the window to an existing Health Sector Support Project, with contributions
from the Government of Canada. This is the first in a package of support that
could total as much as $480 million designed to improve education, promote
skills development, and provide basic services, including water and sanitation,
for refugees in a phased manner.
The global prevalence of fragility has long been characterized by a flat,
unbending line. The World Bank aims to turn the flat line into a sharp, downward curve. To that end, the World Bank, in partnership with the United Nations,
is working to refocus the international community’s attention toward prevention. In March 2018, the two institutions published the joint report, Pathways
for Peace: Inclusive Approaches to Preventing Violent Conflict, which estimated
that violent conflict costs up to $13.6 trillion per year globally. According to the
study, prevention could save up to $70 billion annually.

Responding quickly to disease outbreaks
A severe pandemic can cause millions of deaths and significant losses of global
GDP. World Bank investments support expanding the pandemic preparedness
capacity of country health systems to halt disease outbreaks before they become
pandemics. Under the IDA18 program, these investments will be made in at least
25 countries, along with pandemic preparedness investments in several IBRD
countries. In addition, the Bank’s support to the International Working Group on
Financing Preparedness, as well as its leadership in engaging policy makers—
country finance ministers, in particular—on several pandemic simulations, have
helped drive home the importance of investing in pandemic preparedness.
In the event of severe outbreaks or pandemics, the Pandemic Emergency
Financing Facility (PEF) will enable the Bank to engage with a rapid and early
response. Supported by the World Health Organization, the private sector, and
donors such as Japan, Germany, and Australia, the PEF is the first-ever form of
pandemic insurance, using an innovative combination of public and private
financing, including from capital markets. The PEF, which consists of both a cash
and insurance component, became operational in July 2017 for an initial threeyear period and now covers all 77 IDA countries with pandemic insurance at no
cost. In May 2018, the PEF made the first commitment from its cash window in
the form of a $12 million grant to bridge the financing gap for the Ebola response
in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The quick disbursement of these resources
helped the government to focus their efforts on the immediate response to the
crisis, rather than raising funds.

WO R KI NG ACRO S S AL L S E C TO RS

“We have to be the institution that integrates across all our different
areas and provides enormous value to our member countries.”
—JIM YONG KIM

In all of the areas described above, the World Bank strives to bring the best
development solutions to its clients. But the unique strength of the World Bank
is its ability to combine expertise from many sectors to help countries design,
finance, and implement sustainable projects that provide more benefits and
make a greater impact. In providing such interdependent and multisectoral solutions, the Bank helps to realize sustainable outcomes while responding to local,
country, and regional priorities.
In Bangladesh, for example, the Bank is supporting projects that are working
to improve the country’s transport connectivity, but that also have broader effects
because of the integration of multiple sector approaches. The ongoing $360
million commitment to the Regional Waterway Transport Project will improve the
navigability of 900 kilometers of inland waterways along the Chittagong-DhakaAshuganj Corridor and connecting routes, incorporating solutions from the Bank’s
expertise in transport, but also trade, the environment, and infrastructure to help
reduce travel time and costs for cargo and passengers and to sustainably boost
national and regional trade. The project also supports improvements to social
inclusivity by developing key river ports to include safe, sanitary, and femalefriendly facilities such as bathrooms and waiting rooms. Similarly, the $150 million Regional Connectively Project will modernize trade-related infrastructure,
systems, and procedures to increase Bangladesh’s connectivity and trade with
India, Bhutan, and Nepal. With improvements to key land ports, the investments
will increase trade volumes and reduce clearance time at border posts. In addition
to the trade, transport, and infrastructure solutions that comprise this project, the
investments will also incorporate a perspective informed by gender issues. The
project will pilot activities to help remove bottlenecks faced by women in trade
and business, as well as skills development programs to bring more women traders into formal trade networks and global value chains. The insights gained from
this project will help to develop specific infrastructure, logistics, and transport
services for women in the future.
As these projects demonstrate, by leveraging the collective knowledge base
of the institution, as well as the lessons learned from its operations and the experiences of country members, the World Bank provides layered solutions for the
projects it supports. Integrating an environmental perspective into an infrastructure project or a gender-informed perspective into a trade project allows the
Bank to facilitate development impacts that are greater than the sum of their
parts and that can endure. As the Bank continues its work along the path toward
meeting its goals, it will continue to develop diverse perspectives and innovative
ideas as part of the support it offers to country clients to help them meet their
development needs.

Innovative Finance for
Development Solutions

Through global capital markets, IBRD has been mobilizing finance for its client
countries for over 70 years, leveraging $16 billion in paid-in capital from its
shareholders to fund over $600 billion in projects and programs that help client
countries address development priorities around the world. The World Bank leverages IBRD’s triple-A rating and strong standing in the markets to cost-effectively
raise between $45 and $55 billion annually to support the Bank’s sustainable
development mandate, to develop innovative financial tools that support global
development priorities, and to help clients manage risk and build resilience.

Raising private capital for the poorest countries
In April 2018, IDA made its debut in the global capital markets for the first time
in its nearly 60-year history, leveraging its strong financial position and triple-A
rating. IDA’s inaugural bond—a $1.5 billion, five-year US-dollar benchmark issue—
received strong reception in the market, with total orders reaching $4.6 billion
from around the world. The bond pioneers a new model for development finance
that combines funding from donors with funding raised in the capital markets,
increasing IDA’s lending capacity in IDA18 by 50 percent.
Going forward, IDA will continue to grow its borrowing program to raise
funds that complement donor contributions, enabling it to expand its lifechanging investments in the poorest countries. 

Catalyzing a transformation toward sustainable
capital markets
The World Bank is a leader in mobilizing private investment for development
through the capital markets. Since issuing the first IBRD bond in 1947, the Bank
has been a key promoter of unique capital market instruments that give the
private sector the opportunity to engage in global development priorities. The
World Bank is one of the largest issuers of green bonds, for example, which tap
capital markets to support climate-related projects. Since issuing the first labeled
green bond in 2008, the Bank has issued $11 billion equivalent through more
than 140 transactions in 19 currencies. In April 2018, the Bank issued its first
green bond denominated in Hong Kong dollars (HK$ 1 billion).
The World Bank also supports country efforts to build green bond markets.
Through this work, the Bank helps clients demonstrate leadership on sustainability and climate action, while offering investors an opportunity to support

34	

THE WORLD BANK ANNUAL REPORT 2018

-----------------------Page 38 End-----------------------

development solutions that address climate change. The Bank’s work in this area
is driving growth and innovation. In fiscal 2018, the Bank identified the opportunity to leverage the world’s biggest Shari’ah-compliant debt market (Malaysia)
to combine the sukuk (Islamic Bond) and the green bond into a new financial
instrument for climate finance: the green sukuk. With technical assistance from
the Bank, Tadau Energy, a solar energy company in Malaysia, issued the first
green sukuk in the world in July 2017, raising RM 250 million to finance a
50-megawatt solar photovoltaic power plant. Following this successful demonstration, four green sukuk and one green bond were issued by Malaysian
companies, and Indonesia issued the first sovereign green sukuk in the world.
The World Bank, working with IFC, assisted Fiji in becoming the first emerging
market issuer of a sovereign green bond (F$ 100 million) in the world. The Bank
also provided technical assistance for Nigeria to issue the first African sovereign
green bond (N 10.69 billion). In addition, the Bank supported the development
of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations Green Bond Standards and the
Indonesia Financial Services Authority Green Bond Regulations.
Building on the evolution of the green bond market and a growing demand
from investors for opportunities to make a positive impact, the World Bank has
broadened its offerings of sustainable investing instruments. In January 2018,
IBRD issued a bond to raise awareness for how empowering women and girls
is one of the most effective ways to accelerate economic development, reduce
poverty, and build sustainable societies around the world. The bond raised Can$
1 billion from institutional investors in the Canadian dollar market. In February, the World Bank issued a $350 million private placement with the Folksam
Group to raise awareness for four Sustainable Development Goals—good health
and well-being, gender equality, responsible consumption and production, and
climate action—that anchor Folksam’s sustainability strategy. The World Bank is
also promoting the transition toward sustainable capital markets through its partnership with Japan’s Government Pension Investment Fund. The partnership aims
to identify and address the challenges in greater Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) integration—such as insufficient data and disparate standards—with
the broader goal of directing more capital toward sustainable investments.

Building resilience with disaster insurance and
risk transfer solutions
The World Bank is the largest provider of risk insurance for countries. By intermediating between client countries and the capital markets and through direct
World Bank bond and over-the-counter derivative transactions, the Bank is
helping countries build resilience against risks from natural disasters, pandemic
disease outbreaks, and other destabilizing risks. Risk transfer coverage provides
protection to governments, without increasing public debt, and is an important
complement to other sources of funding, including emergency funds, budget
reserves, credit lines, and international aid. To date, the Bank has provided clients
with $3.9 billion in coverage against catastrophe, weather, and health risks.  
In fiscal 2018, the Bank issued a $360 million catastrophe bond for Mexico
to cover earthquakes and hurricanes, and provided $206 million local currency
catastrophe insurance coverage for 25 provinces in the Philippines against losses
from major typhoons and earthquakes. There have been two payouts under these
programs this fiscal year. Mexico received a $150 million payout following the
powerful 8.2 magnitude earthquake that struck in September 2017. In December

-----------------------Page 39 End-----------------------

2017, Typhoon Vinta triggered a partial payout of PHP 83.5 million ($1.6 million)
to the province of Davao del Sur in the Philippines. In June 2018, the Bank issued
a $1.3 billion catastrophe bond to protect each of Chile, Colombia, Mexico, and
Peru against potential losses from earthquakes. This marked the largest sovereign
risk insurance transaction ever and establishes the World Bank as the largest provider of sovereign risk insurance.

Helping clients to manage public debt
When governments and other public entities need financing for development
investments, borrowing is one of the available options. Ensuring that publicly
held debt does not undermine development objectives requires sound management practices. Effective, strategic, and efficient public debt management is the
cornerstone of financial stability and sustainable fiscal policy.
In fiscal 2018, the World Bank worked with 38 federal and subnational debt
management offices in 33 countries across all regions of the world, helping
governments build institutional capacity in all areas required for effective management of government debt. During fiscal 2018, the World Bank’s debt management advisory services reached more than 500 debt management practitioners
in different countries through webinars, workshops and forums, online communication and virtual peer groups, and in-person meetings to build and manage
long-term relationships with debt managers in partner countries. The World Bank
also provides a repository of knowledge in the form of research reports and publications to stimulate discussions and further research.
Going forward, the World Bank will continue to use capital market innovations
to finance sustainable development, to serve clients through advisory services
and risk management projects, and to maximize the resources available to help
countries to invest in their own development needs.

Promoting Development through
Research, Analysis, and Data

Knowledge is critical to development. The World Bank focuses on evidence-based
development solutions and provides global insights for solving development
challenges through reports and publications, in-depth analytic services, and
freely available development data.

Researching today’s most pressing topics
The World Bank promotes development through its knowledge products, which
include flagship reports, research papers, databases, and global indicators.
Broader access to research and data allows policy makers and advocacy groups to
make better-informed decisions and measure improvements more accurately. In
fiscal 2018 the Bank published several significant reports, including:
•  World Development Report 2018: Learning to
Realize Education’s Promise. Each year, the World
Development Report features a topic of crucial importance to global development. The 2018 edition—the
40th in the series—was the first ever devoted entirely
to education. According to the report, despite massive global gains in access to education, recent learning assessments reveal that many children around
the world are leaving school unequipped with even
foundational literacy and numeracy skills, let alone the
higher-order skills needed for the 21st century. Across many low- and middleincome countries, skills lag far behind what those countries aspire to. The report
uses new data to diagnose what’s causing this learning crisis and how to tackle
it. It proposes starting with learning metrics and evidence-based programs
to make schools work for learners, and urges countries to overcome stubborn
system-level technical and political barriers to learning.
•  Doing Business 2018: Reforming to Create Jobs.
Doing Business compares the business regulations in
190 economies to provide data for governments to
help design sound business regulatory policies and
to encourage research on the important dimensions
of regulatory environments for firms. The report ranks
economies on their overall “ease of doing business”
and analyzes reforms to business regulation—identifying which economies are strengthening their business

environment. The annual rankings have served to spur countries to undertake useful reforms that help create fair, efficient, and transparent rules for the
domestic private sector. In the 15 years of its existence, more than 3,100 business
reforms have been carried out by governments around the world to make it
easier for domestic small and medium enterprises to start, operate, and expand.
•  Women, Business, and the Law 2018. This report
measures gender inequality in the law. Its dataset
identifies barriers to women’s economic participation and encourages the reform of discriminatory
laws. The report—now in its fifth edition—introduces
scoring to better inform the reform agenda, tracks
progress made over the past two years, and identifies
opportunities to ensure economic empowerment
for all. It notes that governments in 65 economies
took steps to improve women’s economic inclusion,
enacting 87 legal reforms during the past two years. However, women continue
to face widespread barriers, entrenched in laws, that keep them out of jobs and
prevent them from owning a business by restricting their access to credit or
control over marital property.
•  Global Economic Prospects. This semi-annual flagship report, published in January and June, analyzes
economic developments and prospects globally,
regionally, and nationally. Each edition contains
special focus reports on economic developments
relevant to policy making and planning. Global Economic Prospects, June 2018: The Turning of the Tide?
noted that despite recent softening, global economic
growth was forecast to remain robust this year. However, growth is expected to decelerate over 2019 and
2020 as global slack dissipates, trade and investment moderate, and financing
conditions tighten. The report recommends policies to rebuild buffers and
accelerate reforms to boost competitiveness, adapt to technological change,
and promote trade openness. Risks to the global economic outlook included
the possibility of financial market disruptions, rising trade protectionism, and
heightened geopolitical tensions.

For more information, visit www.worldbank.org/research.

Employing Advisory Services and Analytics:
Technical advice on specific challenges
The World Bank’s Advisory Services and Analytics (ASA)—that is, the Bank’s nonlending activities—are a vital part of how it contributes to development. Member
countries use the Bank’s technical advice and analysis to develop or implement
better policies, programs, and reforms that help to sustain development over the
long term.
In fiscal 2018, the World Bank produced 1,476 ASA products in over 141 countries. These products ranged from reports on key economic and social issues to
knowledge-sharing workshops, policy notes, and implementation action plans.
The analysis often underpins partnership frameworks, government programs,
38	

THE WORLD BANK ANNUAL REPORT 2018

-----------------------Page 42 End-----------------------

and projects supported by World Bank lending and guarantees. In East Asia and
Pacific, for example, the Bank is providing technical support to several countries
to increase climate adaptation and resilience in order to reduce climate risks that
impact people and livelihoods.
Reimbursable Advisory Services (RAS), another form of ASA, are customized
advisory services requested and paid for by country clients. The World Bank has
around 175 active RAS engagements in 45 countries across its six regions, with
119 delivered in 33 countries in fiscal 2018. Through such services, the World
Bank serves all its member states, including nonborrowing countries.

For more information, visit www.worldbank.org/asa.

Data for development: A global good
The World Bank also recognizes that transparency and accountability are essential
to the development process and central to achieving the Bank’s mission to alleviate
poverty. The Bank’s commitment to openness is also driven by a desire to foster
public ownership, partnership, and participation in development from a wide range
of stakeholders. As a knowledge institution, the World Bank is proud to share its
knowledge freely and openly. Statistics and data are a key part of that knowledge
and are easily accessible through the World Bank’s Open Data website for all users.
The World Development Indicators is the primary World Bank collection of development indicators, compiled from officially recognized international sources. It presents the most current and accurate global development data available and includes
estimates at the national, regional, and global levels.
The World Bank has also taken on the mission of working with its client countries
to ensure all of them have data that serves as evidence for their decision making.
The Bank partners on their efforts to collect good data and promote its access
and use. In 2015, the World Bank identified 77 countries that either had no household-level data at all, had only one household survey in the last 10 years, or two
surveys that were more than five years apart; most were IDA countries. This hinders
their ability to make programmatic and policy decisions based on data and to monitor poverty and shared prosperity trends. The Bank is now engaged in all IDA countries, either through lending or technical assistance, to ensure that the pledge set in
2015 of having all these countries complete one round of surveys by 2020 is met.

Mobilizing Partnerships in a
New Development Landscape

The range of participants within the global development community continues to
grow with traditional and non-traditional actors taking on new and changing roles.
Such an evolving landscape is inspiring a new roadmap for forming partnerships
and strengthening collaboration among stakeholders.

Strengthening partnerships to deepen collaboration
In fiscal 2018, the World Bank reaffirmed its commitment to work with partners of
all kinds to tackle shared global development challenges.
Philanthropy and the private sector. To support and align with the strategic emphasis on Maximizing Finance for Development, the World Bank sharpened
its focus on building partnerships with an expanding group of influential actors
including foundations, new philanthropists, impact investors, social entrepreneurs,
and other private sector leaders. This work catalyzes innovative partnerships and
activates new champions in support of institutional priorities, including forced displacement, climate, gender, and human capital.
Civil society. The World Bank continued to strengthen engagement and collaboration with civil society organizations (CSOs), including faith-based organizations. Throughout the year, the Bank encouraged CSO participation in key policy
discussions, and it enhanced its engagement with CSOs beyond Washington, DC,
including in Indonesia where the World Bank Group and IMF will hold their 2018
Annual Meetings.
The Civil Society Policy Forum hosted at this year’s Annual and Spring Meetings
enabled the Bank and CSOs to deliberate on critical issues such as citizen engagement, financial intermediaries, education, energy, and climate change. More than
1,000 CSO participants attended the Spring Meetings—the largest contingent to
date—demonstrating the enduring interest from CSOs in engaging with the Bank.
A new CSO Innovation Fair, held during the spring Policy Forum, also provided a
unique opportunity for CSOs to engage one another, delegates, and Bank staff
through a showcase of their advocacy campaigns, online data tools, and other innovative products and interventions.
Parliamentarians. As elected representatives, parliamentarians are key to integrating citizen voices into programs and promoting lasting development results.
In this context, the Bank expanded its engagement with parliamentarians through
initiatives such as a pilot outreach program with European parliamentarian staff
who facilitate engagement between legislators and the World Bank, with the aim
of deepening shared understanding, knowledge, and collaboration. The Bank also
launched a global young members of parliament (MPs) initiative with a core group
40	

THE WORLD BANK ANNUAL REPORT 2018

-----------------------Page 44 End-----------------------

of influential parliamentarians under the age of 45, in an effort to cultivate the
next generation of parliamentary leaders committed to overcoming international
development challenges. This year the Bank organized a parliamentary field visit
to Vietnam, which allowed a delegation of 29 MPs from 15 countries to see the
impact of Bank-financed infrastructure projects in Hanoi.
The Annual and Spring Meetings continue to provide important engagement opportunities with parliamentarians. The 2018 Annual Global Parliamentary
Conference, co-organized with the Parliamentary Network and the IMF, hosted
205 MPs from 58 countries, including 9 heads of parliament (speakers and vicespeakers), 20 committee chairs, and 35 members of finance or budget committees. The Conference covered a range of topics including youth unemployment
and job creation, human capital, governance, gender, and development finance.
Partnering within communities. The Bank works actively to engage and
contribute to its local community, whether in Washington, DC, or at country
offices around the world. Through the Community Connections program, the
entire World Bank Group and its staff personally partner with local communities and nongovernmental organizations via staff donations, matching corporate philanthropy, volunteerism, in-kind donations, and an internship program
for students from local public high schools to strengthen the communities in
which it works. Together, these programs leverage a motivated, highly educated,
and international workforce for the betterment of communities where they live
around the world.

Working together to address the critical issues of
our time
The World Bank Group is actively working across the institution to strengthen the
collaboration and partnerships that can help bring immediate attention to critical
global issues.
Fragility. Today more than 68 million people worldwide have been forced
from their homes, and by 2030 almost half of the poor will live in fragile and
conflict-affected situations. Tackling fragility and displacement, and closing the
gap between humanitarian and development work, is critical for the global development agenda and a priority for many of the Bank’s partners and stakeholders.
This year, the World Bank focused its annual Advisory Council—a gathering of
global leaders representing the private sector, impact investors, philanthropists,
and foundations—on fragility to tackle this critical issue from all fronts. Participants discussed the Syrian refugee crisis and presented a collective perspective of
the challenges and opportunities facing actors working in fragile situations. They
also discussed how to leverage each actor’s strengths, such as the patient capital
of foundations, the Bank’s convening power, and the private sector’s a
­ bility to be
agile, create jobs, and spur economic growth. The Advisory Council discussions
led to a commitment from foundations, the private sector, and the World Bank
Group to explore the feasibility of a matchmaking platform in support of refugees
and host communities. This would aim to match private sector companies with
opportunities for refugees and unlock investment financing. It would be accompanied by a global advocacy effort to change the narrative around refugees.
Climate change. This fiscal year the Bank mobilized partnerships across public, private, multilateral, and civil society spheres to advance the climate agenda.
Work continued on shaping Invest4Climate, a platform being developed with UN
partners to leverage public and philanthropic funding to crowd in more private
sector investment for climate action in developing countries. And in May, the

41

-----------------------Page 45 End-----------------------

Bank delivered the second edition of “Innovate4Climate”—a new annual conference bringing together finance, business, technology, and policy leaders to drive
climate investment.
Since 2011, Connect4Climate (C4C) has built a global network of more than
500 partners among civil society, youth coalitions, the private sector, international
organizations, and others. C4C connects individuals and groups, amplifies discourse and interaction, and shares information to promote climate-related events
and activities, with a strong emphasis on engagement with youth. This year, C4C
was involved in initiatives that heightened awareness and advocacy on climate
change. These included All4theGreen in Bologna, a program of more than 80
events focused on climate change leading up to and during the G-7 Environment
Ministerial Meeting in June 2017, and Uniting4Climate, a campaign developed in
collaboration with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change
and the governments of Fiji, Italy, and Germany ahead of and through the 2017
United Nations Climate Change Conference held in Bonn in November 2017 and
the One Planet Summit held in Paris in December 2017. C4C has also successfully continued its long-standing engagement with the film industry through the
Film4Climate global campaign dedicated to advancing climate action and the
inclusion of sustainability messages in films and creative visual storytelling.
Finally, the Private Sector Liaison Officers (PSLO) Network also focused key
missions on sustainable energy and climate-smart agriculture in Washington, DC,
and Abidjan, Côte d’Ivoire, respectively.
Human capital. As the global economy rebounds, more countries are within
reach of achieving real economic gains. These gains may be short-lived and
opportunities may be missed if countries do not invest in human capital to prepare their citizens for the jobs of the future. As the World Bank works to drive
more and better investments in people, it is putting human capital at the center
of its global agenda through the Human Capital Project. The Bank has engaged
stakeholders from the public and private sectors, as well as from civil society and
foundations, to mobilize global support for this effort. From the Annual Meetings’ Human Capital Summit, where government leaders including President Paul
Kagame of Rwanda committed to action to invest in human capital, to the Spring
Meetings’ discussion on making human capital a project for the world with Bill
Gates and UK Secretary of State for International Development Penny Mordaunt, a

42	

THE WORLD BANK ANNUAL REPORT 2018

-----------------------Page 46 End-----------------------

diverse range of stakeholders are coming forward to champion the human capital
agenda in partnership with the Bank.
Technology. Harnessing the power of technology and data presents exciting
opportunities to create new markets, jobs, and economic growth. However, it
must be adopted in a way that ensures that inequality does not increase within
and between countries. The World Bank Group worked actively with partners
this fiscal year to connect clients to the dynamic opportunities of technology
while managing associated challenges. For example, the Bank partnered with
the Global System for Mobile Communications Association (GSMA) to harness
the power of data from the Internet of Things to help developing countries solve
their most critical development challenges. TechEmerge, a first-of-its-kind matchmaking program, connects proven technology solutions from around the world
with organizations and institutions in developing markets. It also supports local
pilot projects to accelerate the adoption of technology where it’s needed most.
This year the World Bank Group launched the TechEmerge program for the health
care market in Brazil, working with 25 health system providers across the country
serving over 19 million patients annually. In addition, the Identification for Development (ID4D) initiative brings global knowledge and expertise to help countries
realize the potential of digital identification systems. To help achieve this, ID4D
has forged partnerships with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the Omidyar Network, and the Government of Australia, whose support brings thought
leadership and funding to this initiative. Lastly, the Digital Economy for Africa Initiative, launched at the Spring Meetings, brought together African governments,
development organizations, bilateral donors, and the private sector to support
building the foundations for digital economies in African countries.
Gender. Achieving true gender equality continues to be a deep challenge.
Many women around the world lack the voice and decision-making ability to
improve their livelihoods for themselves or for their families, especially in developing countries. Investing in gender equality is not only a moral imperative, but also
smart economics. In fiscal 2018, the Bank continued to push for gender equality and empowering women in development through various initiatives, such as
the Women Entrepreneurs Finance Initiative (We-Fi), a collaborative partnership
between the Bank, governments, multilateral development banks (MDBs), and
other stakeholders to help unlock billions of dollars of financing for small and
medium enterprises owned and led by women in developing countries. The initiative aims to address financial and non-financial barriers and create a better
environment for women entrepreneurs. In partnership with the Government of
Canada, the Bank also launched a new study on the economic costs of gender
inequality, which found the global loss in human capital wealth due to gender
inequality to be estimated at $160.2 trillion. The study, which helped inform the
G-7 Finance Ministers meeting in Canada, offers economic evidence to help clients
and partners make the case for investments that close gaps in gender equality.
Multilateral engagement. The World Bank’s participation within key international forums are important opportunities to provide a voice for developing
countries and to advance critical priorities for the Bank’s clients. This year, the
Bank is supporting the Argentinian G-20 Presidency’s efforts to develop infrastructure as an asset class, as well as to prepare governments and workers for an
economy shaped by rising digitalization, automation, and artificial intelligence.
With UNICEF and the Inter-American Development Bank, the World Bank is also
supporting the G-20 priority of early childhood development. In addition, the
Bank is leading efforts to more systematically engage with institutional investors

	

MOBILIZING PARTNERSHIPS IN A NEW DEVELOPMENT L ANDSCAPE 	

43

-----------------------Page 47 End-----------------------

to stimulate greater long-term sustainable financing into developing and developed countries. The Bank has also continued to follow up on work accomplished
last year under the German G-20 Presidency to implement efforts to promote
sustainable and inclusive economic development in Africa, mobilize greater private sector finance, and increase women’s economic empowerment. Within the
G-7, the Bank is strongly supporting Canada’s prioritization of gender issues,
while also demonstrating how MDBs are working more as a system through the
delivery of value for money and the increased development impact achieved
through private sector operations.
Small states. The World Bank uses its convening power to help small states
in taking a collective stand in international forums to highlight the development
challenges they face and draw more attention to their concerns. It convenes an
annual Small States Forum on the margins of the World Bank Group-IMF Annual
Meetings. The forum provides a platform for high-level dialogue on key issues
affecting small states and allows members to showcase development initiatives
and activities. The 2017 Forum in Washington, DC, discussed issues related to
concessional financing, climate finance, private financing, and the blue economy.
Prioritizing partnership efforts and improving efficiencies. To more effectively collaborate with organizations on global development objectives, the World
Bank Group has worked to improve coordination, better leverage capabilities, and
find efficiencies with its partners. This year, President Kim signed a new Strategic
Partnership Framework with UN Secretary-General António Guterres to consolidate the institutions’ joint commitment to help countries implement the 2030
Agenda for Sustainable Development. The agreement deepens the partnership by
focusing efforts on jointly selected priorities and by utilizing the complementary
strengths of the institutions to broaden their impact. It centers on four key areas
of cooperation: finance and implementation support to help countries reach the
sustainable development goals; decisive global action on climate change; joint
work in postcrisis and humanitarian settings; and harnessing data to improve
development outcomes. In addition, the World Bank Group supports the ‘Grand
Bargain’ agreement among aid organizations and donors, which seeks to improve
the effectiveness of humanitarian assistance. Launched at the World Humanitarian
Summit, the Grand Bargain is a commitment to enhance efficiency, transparency,
and collaboration in the way financing is provided and used in crisis situations.

Regional Perspectives

The World Bank operates today out of 140 offices worldwide. An
increased presence in client countries is helping the Bank to better
understand, work more effectively with, and provide more timely services to its partners in those countries. Ninety-four percent of Country
Directors/Country Managers and 43 percent of staff are based in countries within each of the six geographical regions. The following section
highlights the major goals achieved, projects undertaken, strategies
implemented, and publications produced in fiscal 2018.

	

SUPPORTING OUR CLIENTS IN PRIORIT Y AREAS

-----------------------Page 49 End-----------------------

Africa
There is a modest growth recovery underway in Africa, bolstered by broad-based
global growth, loose monetary policies, and a rise in commodity prices. Economic
growth is projected to increase to 3.1 percent in 2018, up from 2.6 percent in 2017,
and reach an average of 3.6 percent in fiscal 2020, reflecting a gradual pick-up
in growth in Nigeria, South Africa, and Angola—the region’s largest economies.
However, many challenges remain. Growth in the non-resource industrial sectors
of oil and metals exporters has yet to pick up, underscoring the slow structural
transformation in the region. In many countries, public debt burdens are increasing,
fueling debt sustainability risks. Poverty continues to be widespread, with rising
fragility and a lack of productive employment contributing to social instability and
intraregional migration.
While the region’s per capita GDP growth will turn positive in 2018, it will remain
insufficient to reduce poverty significantly. The total poverty headcount at the international poverty line is projected to decline only slightly in 2018.

World Bank assistance
The World Bank approved $16.5 billion in lending to the region for 138 projects
in fiscal 2018, including $1.1 billion in IBRD loans and $15.4 billion in IDA commitments. Revenue from Reimbursable Advisory Services agreements with nine countries was $7.5 million. Key focus areas of the World Bank strategy for Africa include:
raising agricultural productivity, increasing access to affordable and reliable energy,
building resilience to climate change, promoting regional integration, and boosting
human capital.

Harnessing technology for clean and reliable energy
At only 42.8 percent (as of 2016), energy access in Africa lags behind other regions.
As part of efforts to ensure access to affordable, reliable, and sustainable energy
for all, the Bank’s work in the region supports grid extension and expansion of
the transmission network, innovative off-grid electrification solutions, expansion of
renewable generation capacity, development of regional power pools, and improvement of service efficiency. In addition, the Bank is supporting the development and
adoption of new technologies such as solar storage solutions, smart meters, mobile
utility payments, satellite mapping and imaging, high-voltage direct current transmission, and solar home systems and mini-grids.
The renewable energy program Scaling Solar is yielding strong results, making
privately funded grid-connected solar projects operational within two years with
competitive tariffs. In Zambia, auctions have resulted in some of the lowest tariffs in
Africa ($0.06 per kilowatt hour). The program has expanded to include activities in
Ethiopia, Madagascar, and Senegal.

Investing in the early years and empowering women and youth
Of the 250 million children under the age of 5 in Africa, one-third are stunted and
less than one-quarter are enrolled in preschool, threatening economic growth and
social development in the region. The World Bank employs a multisectoral approach
to reduce stunting, expand access to early learning, and harness social protection
opportunities to reach the most vulnerable. In Rwanda, for example, the Bank is
helping to address chronic malnutrition through health and nutrition interventions, high-quality child feeding and hygiene practices, enhanced access to food
through cash transfers, and support for improvements in household food security
and dietary diversity.
Meanwhile, the $205 million multisectoral Sahel Women’s Empowerment and
Demographic Dividend Project stretching across six countries (Burkina Faso, Chad,
Côte d’Ivoire, Mali, Mauritania, and Niger) is providing 210,000 young women with
life skills and livelihood interventions and helping 87,000 girls to continue their
schooling. The program seeks to strengthen resilience in the Sahel by giving women
and girls the tools to shape their own future and improve access to quality reproductive, child, and maternal health services.

Scaling up social protection with innovative approaches
The World Bank contributed $17 million to the Social Safety Nets Project in Sierra
Leone, which provides regular income support to extremely poor households
across the country. The project is currently supporting roughly 30,000 households
with quarterly payments and rolling out workshops on health, nutrition, and basic
financial literacy. By harnessing digital technology and mobile phones, the program can collect quality data in the field and transmit this quickly to headquarters,
thereby conducting efficient targeting and enrollment, delivering timely payments
with electronic verification, recording grievances, and monitoring activities. The
approach has been adopted by the government and replicated in other interventions, including during the Ebola crisis and the recent mudslides.

Promoting climate resilience and sustainable transport
Despite being the lowest carbon emitter, Africa is more vulnerable to climate change
than other regions—of the top 10 countries most vulnerable to climate change
impact, nine are in Africa. The Bank’s Africa Climate Business Plan (ACBP) sets out
a work program to leverage financing in support of climate change adaptation. As
shown in the second ACBP progress report, as of June 30, 2018, there are 186 World
Bank–supported projects worth $20 billion contributing to ACBP implementation.
To reduce greenhouse gas emissions and connect citizens to jobs, the World
Bank is supporting the construction of a fully segregated 18.3-kilometer Bus Rapid

Transit system in Dakar, Senegal. Approved in 2017 by the Board, the $300 million
pilot project has the potential for replication and scaling up across the region.

Partnering on research to improve entrepreneurship
The World Bank Group joined forces with a team of psychologists from the University of Singapore and Leuphana University in Germany to develop and pilot a
psychology-based personal initiative training in Togo that focuses on developing
non-cognitive skills and successful entrepreneurial behavior.  The results from this
pilot, recently published in Science Magazine, demonstrated the effectiveness of
the psychology-based training for entrepreneurs, who saw their profits rise by an
average of 30 percent relative to the control group. Female entrepreneurs who
received the training saw an average increase of 40 percent in monthly profits. The
promising results of the pilot have led governments and other multilateral institutions to apply these lessons in their entrepreneurship programs and further adapt
and scale the training for other sectors and country contexts.

PROJECT SPOTLIGHT

Maximizing finance for development in Kenya’s energy sector
Over the past two decades, Kenya’s energy sector has undergone a series of reforms
to create enabling conditions for private sector investment. As a result, Kenya has
mobilized at least $2.5 billion in private capital in the power sector toward overcoming its power generation deficits. With adequate power generation capacity
available, Kenya is now driving one of the most successful electrification programs
in Sub-Saharan Africa, encompassing both grid and off-grid solutions. Kenya has
made 1.2 million new electricity connections per year in the last three years—a
tremendous feat in the African context.
Under the $135 million Kenya Private Sector Power Generation Support Project,
IDA guarantees leveraged $431 million from private capital for the development of
250 megawatts of thermal capacity, which were commissioned between 2013 and
2016. MIGA provided breach-of-contract guarantees, while IFC provided long-term
financing. A separate $180 million IDA guarantee was recently approved that will
help the Kenya Electricity Generating Company (KenGen) strengthen its financial
position through a corporate debt restructuring process to help KenGen raise up
to $300 million in long-term commercial financing. Proceeds from the new loan
will be used to refinance an expensive portion of KenGen’s existing commercial
loans and enhance KenGen’s credit quality, thereby reducing financial costs and
extending maturity periods. It will also contribute to the creation of an enabling
environment for the sustainable development of renewable energy in Kenya.
As a result of these combined
efforts, 30 percent of the installed
generation capacity (around 700
megawatts) is developed through
independent power producers,
representing 44 percent of the
incremental generation capacity
since 1990. Kenya’s two major
utilities, Kenya Power and Lighting
Company and KenGen, are publicly listed and able to tap into capital markets for financing needs.

East Asia and Pacific
Growth in East Asia and Pacific accelerated to 6.6 percent in 2017, making it one
of the fastest growing regions in the world. Underpinned by prospects for continued broad-based global recovery and robust domestic demand, regional growth is
expected to remain strong, though it is forecast to moderate to 6.2 percent in 2018.
After growing faster than anticipated in 2017, China is expected to slow moderately to 6.5 percent in 2018. With improved prospects for investment and private
consumption, growth in Thailand is expected to strengthen in 2018. In the Philippines and Vietnam, growth is anticipated to remain stable, while in Malaysia it
is expected to ease. In East Asia’s smaller economies, the prospects are generally
favorable. The outlook for the Pacific Island countries is mixed, with modest but
volatile growth in the smaller nations and an easing of growth in Fiji and Papua
New Guinea. The two main risks to growth are a faster-than-expected tightening of
global financing conditions and the escalation of trade protectionism.
While poverty continues to decline, over a quarter of the region’s population
remains economically insecure, and inequality is perceived to be high and rising in
many countries. Rapid urbanization and business demands are feeding a massive
need for infrastructure investment in the region, where 130 million lack access to
power, 600 million lack access to adequate sanitation, and broadband infrastructure and connectivity are lagging. Fragility and conflict are also intensifying in
some countries.

World Bank assistance
The World Bank approved $4.6 billion for 38 projects in the region in fiscal 2018,
including $4.0 billion in IBRD loans and $631 million in IDA commitments. The Bank
also signed 10 Reimbursable Advisory Services agreements with four countries and
one with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations for a total of $11.7 million. The
Bank’s regional strategy focuses on three main areas: private sector–led growth, resilience and sustainability, and human capital and inclusion.

Supporting private sector–led growth with knowledge and lending
With the private sector accounting for 90 percent of jobs, a focus on private sector–
led growth is key to reducing poverty and promoting inclusive growth in the region.
In March 2018, the World Bank Group organized a conference in Vietnam highlighting the importance of a sound business environment. Participants discussed
specific actions to streamline administrative procedures and enhance efficiency in
areas such as business licensing, paying taxes, and trading across borders. The Bank
is also supporting the establishment of robust regulatory and policy frameworks in
countries such as Thailand, Brunei, and Malaysia.

To promote private sector involvement in sustainable development, the Bank
supported the $55 million Geothermal Energy Upstream Development Project in
Indonesia, which aims to facilitate investment in geothermal power generation. In
Vietnam, the Bank is providing advisory assistance for capacity building and institutional reforms to promote private investments as part of the $238 million Sustainable Agriculture Transformation Project. Additionally, as part of overall Maximizing
Finance for Development efforts in the region, the Bank and IFC piloted Infrastructure Assessment Programs in Indonesia and Vietnam to assess constraints to private
sector investment in infrastructure.
The World Bank is also focusing on empowering women in the workplace. For
example, in the Solomon Islands, the Bank is investing in women’s skills development, while in Vietnam, it is informing a gender-focused policy dialogue on the new
labor code.

Enhancing sustainable infrastructure, natural wealth,
and climate resilience
The region contributes a large and growing share of carbon emissions globally and
is one of the most vulnerable regions to climate impacts and natural disasters. In
the Philippines, recurrent flooding has made life more difficult for the poorest populations who live in low-lying areas, on riverbanks, and in other danger zones. The
$208 million Metro Manila Flood Management Project will modernize 36 existing
pumping stations, allow for the construction of 20 new ones, and improve supporting infrastructure along critical waterways.
To enhance natural wealth and resilience, the $38 million Green Growth Development Policy Operation series in Lao People’s Democratic Republic is supporting
better governance of natural resources and the environment. At the 2017 United
Nations Climate Change Conference in Bonn, the World Bank–supported Climate
Vulnerability Assessment for Fiji was launched, which identified measures to help Fiji
and Fijians become more resilient. To reduce air pollutants and carbon emissions by
increasing energy efficiency and clean energy in China, a $500 million program will
help provide financing for enterprises that take action under China’s Air Pollution
Prevention and Control Action Plan.

Investing in human capital for inclusive growth
Public perceptions in the region point to concerns about high and rising inequality,
falling mobility, and growing economic insecurity. Some of the long-term trends
that previously supported the region’s more equitable growth—such as the demographic transition and rapid urbanization—need to be better managed.

Investments in human capital are key to increasing productivity and achieving
inclusive growth. Investing in the early years, with a focus on fighting malnutrition
and reducing high stunting rates, remains a regional priority. In Indonesia, conditional cash transfers under the Family Hope Program have been associated with a
reduction in severe stunting by 3 percentage points. To build on this success, the
government, with World Bank financing, will scale up its coverage from 3.5 million
families in 2015 to 10 million by the end of 2020.
Having improved overall health outcomes, China faces new challenges, including
an aging population, an increasing burden of chronic diseases, and fast-rising health
expenditures. The $600 million Health Reform Program-for-Results aims to tackle
those challenges by improving hospital services, establishing a people-centered integrated care model, and creating an enabling policy and institutional environment.

PROJECT SPOTLIGHT

Generating opportunities for the people of Lao PDR
In Lao PDR, the Nam Theun 2 (NT2) Social and Environment Project brought
together 27 development partners and financiers to help develop a modern, safe,
and environmentally and socially sustainable hydropower project that could generate power and expand opportunities for modern livelihoods.
NT2 is expected to generate $2 billion in revenues over a 20-year period. These
revenues flow back to the people of Lao PDR through investments in poverty
reduction and environmental programs. In addition to revenues invested in education, health, and other social programs, the project covers the protection of large
areas with rich biodiversity, with the Nakai Nam-Theun Protected Area slated to
become one of Lao PDR’s first national parks.
New sources of livelihoods have emerged for the resettled families on the Nakai
Plateau, with the incomes of 97 percent of households having doubled since
before the project. In addition to new homes with bathrooms, electricity, and
rainwater-collection tanks, the project included the construction of schools, health
centers, and an upgraded district hospital. Today, about 90 percent of children
aged five to nine attend schools, child mortality has dropped from 120 per 1,000
before resettlement to 50 per 1,000, and 90 percent of resettled children under
five are immunized.
The World Bank is working with the government and other partners to ensure
that NT2 continues to build on its accomplishments. This includes providing financial and technical support to many sectors, including conservation, agriculture,
fiscal management, and village development.

Europe and Central Asia
In fiscal 2018, growth in Europe and Central Asia was stronger than at any time since
the global financial crisis. Growth was robust across the region, especially in Central
Europe and Turkey. In 2017, GDP rose 2.7 percent, and annual private consumption
rose 2.5 percent. Growth is forecast to moderate to 2.3 percent in 2018. However,
increased capacity utilization, unemployment rates close to their 2007 levels, and
average inflation now exceeding 2 percent are all signals that regional growth is
likely to slow further.
During the economic upswing, many countries in the region increased their
exports and reduced fiscal deficits, providing a cushion if cyclical headwinds
materialize. Going forward, however, the region will face additional challenges
navigating the global tightening of financial conditions and the rising tendencies
toward protectionism.

World Bank assistance
The World Bank approved $4.5 billion in lending to the region for 37 projects in
fiscal 2018, including $3.6 billion in IBRD loans and $957 million in IDA commitments. The Bank also signed 35 Reimbursable Advisory Services agreements with
11 countries for a total of about $75 million. These agreements provided technical advice on issues such as public finance and fiscal reforms, urban planning and
development, and strengthening education and skills for employment. The Bank’s
regional strategy seeks to support clients in enhancing productivity and building
resilience through investments in sustainable and inclusive growth; in human capital
to ensure people stay healthy, educated, and productive; and to mitigate the impact
of climate change and natural disasters.

Promoting sustainable and inclusive growth
The Bank supports client countries in building solid foundations for macroeconomic and financial stability, improving governance and institutions, and creating an
enabling environment for private sector–led growth. In Bosnia and Herzegovina, a
$60 million project is strengthening the financial sector in the country. In Turkey, the
Bank provided a $400 million loan to provide better access to finance for womeninclusive enterprises and to businesses active in areas with large refugee communities.
In fiscal 2018, the Bank also provided financial support to boost trade and connectivity throughout the region, including a $50 million project to improve private
sector competitiveness in Georgia, a $60 million loan to modernize transport connectivity in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and a $50 million loan to improve regional
and local roads in Albania. Additionally, the Bank is supporting improved access to
affordable, quality, and high-speed broadband services in Kosovo through the $25
million Digital Economy Project, and improving regional digital connectivity infrastructure and building a digital economy in the Kyrgyz Republic through the $50
million Digital Central Asia–South Asia project.

Supporting critical investments in human capital
Prioritizing and investing in the systems that help ensure people are healthy, educated, and connected is essential for economic growth. The World Bank continued
to work with countries to improve the quality of health care systems, supporting
Serbia with $31 million of additional financing to improve access to cancer prevention and care, investing $100 million in emergency medical services in Uzbekistan, and providing a $125 million loan to support the modernization of Belarus’s
health system.
In Azerbaijan, additional financing of $67 million provided access to basic rural
infrastructure to 95 percent of households with internally displaced persons. In
Kazakhstan, a $67 million loan will improve the quality of and equity in primary and
secondary education in rural and disadvantaged schools.
The Bank’s knowledge products provide evidence-based solutions and valuable
insights to help support policy makers make well informed decisions to address
development priorities. The report, Growing United: Upgrading Europe’s Convergence Machine, looked at how Europe can boost growth and prosperity for all
citizens at a time when the rise of technology risks leaving behind the poorest
countries, lagging regions, and unskilled workers. The report recommends policies
that ensure people have the right skills to pursue new opportunities and increased
access to quality education and training, and that improve the country’s business
environment to create more jobs and opportunities for people.
A survey on marginalized Roma in the Western Balkans, jointly conducted by the
World Bank and the United Nations Development Programme and supported by the
European Commission, showed increased school attendance but also a growing gap
between Roma and non-Roma in health, employment, and housing. The results can
help inform policies that address the challenges that Roma people face in Western
Balkan countries.

Building resilience to climate change and natural disasters
The World Bank focused on building resilience to climate change and natural disasters with investments across the region in three areas: low-carbon energy transition,
sustainable land-use management, and climate resilience.
The Bank is supporting energy efficiency in countries across the region, including through a $200 million loan to support energy-saving investments in Uzbekistan
and a $31 million credit to reduce energy consumption and fossil fuel use in public buildings in Kosovo. The Bank is also continuing to support low-carbon energy
sources, improving dam safety, and rehabilitating a hydropower plant in Tajikistan
with a $225 million loan and grant, and improving dam safety and efficiency in
Albania with additional financing of $14 million. In Belarus, a $14 million project is

is helping to introduce sustainable land management practices.
The Bank supported disaster risk management development policy loans in
Serbia and Romania with catastrophe deferred drawdown option loans of $70
­
million and $493 million, respectively. These investments provide rapid access to
funding for natural disaster response and help strengthen institutional and legal
frameworks to better manage the physical and fiscal impacts of natural disasters
when they occur.

PROJECT SPOTLIGHT

Building momentum on Uzbekistan’s economic transformation
Uzbekistan has made rapid progress in adopting major reforms to transform its
economy. In less than two years, the government has made significant progress
toward liberalizing its currency, lifting trade and investment barriers, improving
business regulations, and opening markets to attract private sector investment and
boost exports. The government has also introduced safety nets to protect its most
vulnerable people and prioritized citizen engagement.
To support this transformation, the World Bank has realigned its country strategy to help the country build a market economy, reform state institutions, broaden
dialogue with citizens, and invest in human capital. Uzbekistan’s social and economic transformation has also generated new momentum among Central Asian
countries for greater regional cooperation in energy, transport, water, and economic connectivity.
In fiscal 2018, the Bank approved $1.4 billion for five new projects in Uzbekistan,
focusing on energy efficiency, horticulture, and emergency medical services. Overall financing in Uzbekistan amounts to $3.3 billion in existing projects that support
Uzbekistan’s transition to a market economy, as well as reforms in the transport and
education sectors, urban development, and water supply and sanitation services.
The World Bank is also working closely with the government to modernize and
diversify the massive agricultural sector, which employs millions of people, and
help the country completely end the use of forced labor.

Latin America and
the Caribbean
After suffering the global downturn worse than any other region, Latin America and
the Caribbean turned the corner in fiscal 2018. Excluding Venezuela, average GDP
in the region grew 1.9 percent in 2017 and is expected to accelerate to 2.6 percent
in 2018 and 2.8 percent in 2019.
The World Bank is promoting faster and more equitable growth in the region to
buttress the profound social transformation seen during the first decade of the 21st
century, when the commodity boom fueled an expansion that helped cut poverty
rates by half. Between 2003 and 2016, the share of the population living in extreme
poverty in the region fell from 24.5 percent to 9.9 percent. Since then, however, the
pace of poverty reduction and growth of the middle class has stalled.

World Bank assistance
The World Bank approved $4.3 billion in lending to the region for 34 projects in
fiscal 2018, including $3.9 billion in IBRD loans and $428 million in IDA commitments. The Bank also issued the first-ever multi-country catastrophe bond between
Chile, Colombia, Mexico, and Peru, valued at more than $1.3 billion, and signed
18 Reimbursable Advisory Services agreements with nine countries for a total of
$5.5 million.
In fiscal 2018, the Bank’s priorities in the region centered on supporting inclusive growth through higher productivity and competitiveness, with an emphasis on
investing in education, health, and other aspects of human capital. It also invested in
infrastructure and worked to improve countries’ abilities to manage and withstand
shocks—such as natural disasters, economic upheaval, and crime and violence—
while promoting greater transparency and accountability. In addition, the World Bank
prioritized the inclusion of groups that have traditionally faced exclusion, including
indigenous peoples and rural communities. As countries’ needs often exceed public
resources, the Bank supported activities and interventions that attracted private
investment whenever possible.

Leveraging innovations to support economic recovery
Natural disasters are a constant threat in the region, which can have detrimental
impacts on economic growth. Following the devastating 2017 hurricane season,
the Bank and its partners helped Caribbean countries conduct damage assessments
and prepare emergency response projects. In Dominica, for example, the Bank
pledged $115 million to support efforts to build climate resilience. The Bank also
leveraged innovative solutions to transfer risks to capital markets and offer financial
protection to participating governments.
In Haiti, the Bank conducted an Urbanization Review to help lay the roadmap
for the sustainable development of Haitian cities. The Bank is also supporting the
Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States to implement the Eastern Caribbean

Oceanscape Policy endorsed by 11 Caribbean heads of state. This involves advising
governments on concrete actions to generate sustainable blue growth that balances
economic activity with the preservation of healthy coastal and marine ecosystems.
Public and private sector investment in infrastructure is a key element of both
growth and resilience. In fiscal 2018, the Bank provided $64 million for sanitation in
Brazil, $24 million for water delivery in Panama, and $17 million for municipal services in the Dominican Republic. In addition, a $150 million project helped improve
over 1,500 kilometers of economically vital roads in Argentina, while the $74 million
Paraguay Road Maintenance Project helped the country improve the effectiveness
of road maintenance.

Investing in people to improve lives and the economy
Building up human capital by providing new opportunities to traditionally disadvantaged groups improves not only their lives, but also the entire country’s economic
strength. In Mexico, through a $100 million project, the World Bank helped over a
million women, indigenous peoples, and underprivileged and rural residents get
access to credit and savings institutions for the first time.
The Bank also supported Peru in improving health and nutrition services for
the poor. The $25 million Results in Nutrition Project has helped the government
make major progress in improving health outcomes and decreasing hunger. As a
result, Peru has more than halved malnutrition among children under five, from 28
percent in 2008 to 13.1 percent in 2016. Meanwhile, in Chile, the Bank-supported
the $40 million Tertiary Finance for Results Project III, which helped the government
improve tertiary education by strengthening the links between public funding and
accountability for results.

Employing knowledge to solve countries’ unique challenges
The Bank also provides a host of Reimbursable Advisory Services and technical
assistance to countries in the region. In Colombia, these services supported the
implementation of public sector accounting regulation, agriculture insurance for
small farmers, and preparation of a broad socioemotional program for teachers and
students to improve education. In Mexico, the Bank provided technical assistance
on transport and governance. In Chile, the Bank helped with an assessment of
special economic zones and the social protection system, while in Peru it advised
on housing, improving conditions in urban slums, and strengthening the control
framework for public-private partnerships. The Bank also advised Argentina on
improving health care and Paraguay on forestry, finance, competitiveness, governance, and education.

A series of groundbreaking reports and conferences also served as powerful
convening platforms in the region. These included timely studies such as At a Crossroads: Higher Education in Latin America and the Caribbean; The Jobs of Tomorrow: Technology, Productivity, and Prosperity in Latin America and the Caribbean;
and Raising the Bar: For Productive Cities in Latin America and the Caribbean.

PROJECT SPOTLIGHT

Building resilience to natural disasters with catastrophe bonds
Last year was a stark reminder that Latin America and the Caribbean is one of the
most exposed regions to natural disasters. Devastating hurricanes left hundreds of
victims across the Caribbean. Two earthquakes rattled Mexico. Flooding and landslides followed heavy rains in Colombia and Peru. When such disasters strike, it is
often the poorest who suffer the most. With these events in mind, the World Bank
has sought to help countries in the region access greater risk insurance through
capital markets.
This year, the Bank issued more than $1.3 billion in catastrophe bonds as insurance against earthquakes in the Pacific Alliance—an economic and development
initiative between Chile, Colombia, Mexico, and Peru. The “Cat Bond” issuance was
the largest of its kind ever placed and the first involving multiple countries. These
bonds pay investors a premium for a set number of years, with governments receiving a payout if a covered disaster happens and bondholders getting the principal
back if not. This transfers part of the risk of disasters from governments to markets,
ensuring the quick mobilization of funds and fiscal resilience in the face of disaster.
To date, the Bank has facilitated nearly $4 billion in risk transactions worldwide.
The Cat Bonds highlight the fact that building resilience involves more than just
reducing exposure to threats. It is also crucial to design and implement policies
that will ensure the well-being of all and allow economic growth to continue after
a disaster. The Cat Bonds are also a huge step forward for regional integration and
put Latin America at the vanguard of risk management.

Middle East and
North Africa
Although violence and the consequences of war continue to take their toll in Libya,
the Syrian Arab Republic, and the Republic of Yemen, the past year has seen several
positive developments in the Middle East and North Africa region. Recovery and
reconstruction efforts are underway in Iraq following the liberation of its territory,
while countries such as the Arab Republic of Egypt and Saudi Arabia have undergone major economic and social reforms. With support from the international community, Syrian refugees and host communities in Lebanon and Jordan continued to
show remarkable resilience, and Libya witnessed a renewed push for solutions to its
ongoing crisis.
Aided by reforms and firmer oil prices, regional economic growth is forecast to
increase from 2 percent in 2017 to 3.1 percent in 2018. This growth will be broadbased, with most countries in the region seeing an uptick.

World Bank assistance
The World Bank approved $6.4 billion in lending to the region for 26 projects in
fiscal 2018, including $5.9 billion in IBRD loans and $430 million in IDA commitments. Revenue from Reimbursable Advisory Services agreements with nine countries, as well as the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), was around $55 million, with
the program expanding and focusing on key areas of support to the ongoing reform
process in the GCC countries. The Maximizing Finance for Development approach is
now an integral part of Bank Group programs in almost all countries in the region,
with subregional strategies developed for the Maghreb, the Mashreq, and Egypt.
The Middle East and North Africa regional strategy puts the promotion of peace
and social stability at its center and continues to guide the Bank’s engagement. The
strategy’s four pillars focus on forging a new social contract with citizens; increasing
regional cooperation; building resilience, which includes addressing the challenges
of forcibly displaced people; and supporting recovery and reconstruction. Many
Bank programs in the region include more than one of these pillars.

Renewing the social contract
Promoting more accountable and more inclusive structures and supporting private
sector–driven economies to provide greater opportunities remain key regional priorities for the Bank. In Tunisia, for example, a $60 million project targeted youth
facing unemployment, another $100 million project focused on early childhood
development, and a separate $140 million program supported farmers. In Lebanon,
a $400 million program promoted labor-market reforms and skills training, including for refugees. A $30 million project in the West Bank and Gaza supported fiscal
measures while strengthening the business environment, and a separate $13 million Innovative Private Sector Development Project further strengthened the role of

technology in helping to develop the private sector. In Djibouti, a $15 million project
sought to foster women and youth entrepreneurship and further highlighted the
region’s private sector focus, while in Egypt, a $500 million project supported critical reforms in the education sector.

Increasing regional cooperation
The Middle East and North Africa is the least integrated region in the world. The
Bank’s activities in the region, therefore, focus on promoting greater cooperation,
efficiency, and interdependence, particularly in the energy and private sectors,
where reforms will enhance cross-border investments and reinforce moves toward
a regional market. In fiscal 2018, a $1.2 billion program in Egypt enhanced fiscal
stabilization and private sector reforms in the energy sector while further reducing
subsidies. In Morocco, a $200 million program enhanced private sector participation in municipal infrastructure, while another $200 million program supported
private sector activities in agriculture. To promote the expansion of renewable
energy capacity in the country, the Bank also provided $100 million in additional
financing for the Noor Solar Power Project in central Morocco, which promotes
private sector participation.

Building resilience to forced displacement
In countries throughout the region, especially in Jordan, Lebanon, and Iraq, the
forcibly displaced—including refugees and internally displaced persons—continue
to pose challenges for local services. In Jordan, a $200 million program for education
reform will benefit both host communities and refugees in the country. Meanwhile, in
Lebanon, Syrian refugees are among the beneficiaries of a $295 million project
that will improve public transportation in Beirut and the surrounding areas. These
projects all include concessional financing from the Global Concessional Financing
Facility, an initiative launched in 2016 that leverages funding from donor countries
to bridge the financing gap for countries dealing with refugee crises.

Supporting economic recovery and reconstruction
Following the liberation of Iraq from ISIS, the World Bank has focused on recovery
and reconstruction in the country. This effort includes the $300 million Iraq Social
Fund for Development Project focused on small-scale community projects, the
$200 million Iraq Emergency Social Stabilization and Resilience Project focused on
social protection for vulnerable populations, and $400 million in additional financing for the Emergency Operation for Development Project. Meanwhile, the $210
million Baghdad Water Supply and Sewerage Improvement Project underlines the

Bank’s commitment to longer-term reforms in Iraq’s water sector, including creating the enabling environment for private sector investments.
Elsewhere in the region, the Bank has expanded support to vulnerable communities affected by conflict, most notably in the Republic of Yemen, where a humanitarian crisis looms. In fiscal 2018, the Republic of Yemen received three grants totaling
$400 million for health and nutrition, specifically targeting the cholera outbreak,
urban services, and emergency electricity provision.

PROJECT SPOTLIGHT

Enabling Private Sector Participation and Reforming the Energy
Sector in Egypt
In 2014, energy subsidies in the Arab Republic of Egypt were 6.6 percent of GDP—
more than the public expenditure for health, education, and social protection combined. Daily power outages reached six hours. Political turmoil following 2011 and
limited inter-ministerial coordination presented additional challenges. The private
sector, dissuaded by the perception of insurmountable risks and credibility concerns, had not invested in the sector since 2002.
This prompted a comprehensive response by the World Bank Group, encompassing a $3.2 billion loan from IBRD, a $200 million guarantee insuring against
political risk by MIGA, and the largest-ever renewable energy investment by IFC of
$653 million.
Between 2014 and 2018, Egypt witnessed a remarkable transformation in its
energy sector. Subsidies went down to 3.3 percent of GDP, backed by a robust
social protection mechanism and additional funds made available for social programs. Legislation and regulations designed to facilitate private sector participation in the renewable energy, electricity, and gas sectors were enacted, leading to
more than $2 billion in private investments leveraged by IFC and MIGA and 1,500
megawatts of new solar energy capacity. The program also led to the establishment of the world’s largest solar park, creating long-term employment for 500
people in one of Egypt’s poorest regions, largely benefiting the most vulnerable
members of the population.

South Asia
South Asia remains the fastest-growing region in the world, with economic growth
projected to accelerate from 6.6 percent in 2017 to 6.9 percent in 2018 and 7.1
percent in 2019, driven by strong private consumption, recovering exports, and
investments due to policy reforms and infrastructure upgrades. Risks to the outlook
mainly stem from domestic factors, including weak exports, slow progress on fiscal
consolidation, high deficits, and disruptions due to natural disasters.
Robust growth has translated into declining poverty and impressive improvements in health and education. However, as of 2013, the proportion of people living on less than $1.90 a day was estimated at 14.7 percent, or about 249 million
people—a third of the global poor. Moreover, many countries in the region suffer from extreme forms of social exclusion and significant infrastructure gaps. The
region has also seen the largest refugee influx in modern times, with more than
690,000 Rohingya refugees fleeing to Bangladesh since August 2017, according to
United Nations estimates.

World Bank assistance
The World Bank approved $10.7 billion in lending to the region for 56 projects in
fiscal 2018, including $4.5 billion in IBRD loans and $6.2 billion in IDA commitments,
of which $451 million came from the IDA Scale-Up Facility. The Bank also delivered 150 advisory services and analytical products to countries across the region,
providing technical advice on issues such as energy sector reform, female labor
force participation, and climate change. The Bank’s regional strategy emphasizes
sustaining inclusive growth, investing in people, and addressing fragility. It focuses
on supporting private sector development and job creation, particularly for women;
investing in sustainable cities and climate-smart agriculture; and strengthening
inclusion, public institutions, and governance.

Supporting sustainable growth and creating jobs
Economic growth in the region has been driven mainly by consumption and infrastructure upgrades, and can only be sustained at high levels if both investment and
exports grow stronger. Moreover, with an estimated 1.5 million people entering the
job market every month over the next two decades, job creation is essential. To
address these challenges, the World Bank supports efforts such as the $300 million Punjab Agriculture and Rural Transformation Project in Pakistan, which seeks to
improve agriculture productivity, raise farmers’ incomes, and create jobs on farms
and in agribusinesses.
The World Bank is also helping countries maximize their development resources
by drawing on private financing and sustainable private sector solutions. The

operation, supported MIGA guarantees of up to $9 million for private investment in
the Rikweda Fruit Process Company in Afghanistan, a raisin production and processing plant. In India, the World Bank and IFC worked together and attracted private
capital for the development of the 750-megawatt Rewa Ultra Mega Project in the
low-income state of Madhya Pradesh, one of the largest solar plants in the world.
Two World Bank guarantees helped Pakistan access over $1 billion in international
commercial financing in support of policy reforms for growth, competitiveness, and
infrastructure investments, such as the Dasu Hydropower Project.

Investing in human capital and supporting inclusive growth
To strengthen human capital as a driver of growth, the Bank focuses on improving access to and the quality of education, addressing stunting and malnutrition,
strengthening health systems and services, and supporting safety nets to protect the
poorest. Initiatives such as the $500 million Health Sector Support Project in Bangladesh, the $600 million Sehatmandi Project in Afghanistan, and the $100 million
General Education Modernization Project in Sri Lanka build upon earlier efforts to
improve the quality and accessibility of health and education services in the region.
At 28 percent, the labor participation of women in South Asia is very low and
has even declined in some countries. To address the factors that are holding women
back, the Bank focuses on improving their skills, promoting financial inclusion, and
changing social norms. One critical barrier to greater female participation in the
labor force is lack of access to safe transportation, which the Bank is addressing
through transport programs in Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan.

Fostering resilience to conflict and climate change
Conflict and fragility risks are increasing in South Asia, resulting in growing displacement and border tensions. The World Bank is working with its partners to
provide basic services to the displaced and hosting communities, such as the recent
$114 million project in Pakistan that aims to support families affected by militancyrelated violence, improve child health care, and establish safety net systems in
affected parts of the Federally Administered Tribal Areas. The Bank is also supporting Nepal’s historic transition to a federal democratic republic through a $200
million development policy credit, which includes resources from the IDA18 Risk
Mitigation Regime.
South Asia is also highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, including climate-induced natural disasters and rising sea levels. Progress in South Asia
depends on reducing carbon emissions, changing the energy mix, mitigating
the effects of climate change, and building climate resilience. For example, the

$420 million Maharashtra Project on Climate-Resilient Agriculture in India aims
to improve smallholder farmers’ capacity to adjust and modify their production
systems to withstand future impacts from climate events.

Promoting regional integration
Regional integration and economic cooperation can enhance the prospects for poverty reduction and shared growth, yet South Asia remains one of the least integrated
regions in the world. The Bank therefore focuses on energy and electricity trade,
transport connectivity, and long-term water security in the region. In Afghanistan,
the new $51 million Digital Central Asia–South Asia Project is helping to build the
government’s capacity to deliver digital services and develop regionally integrated
digital infrastructure. It will also support private sector development by opening the
telecommunications market.

PROJECT SPOTLIGHT

Digital Youth Summit advances Pakistan’s tech revolution
In April 2018, 5,000 students participated in the annual Digital Youth Summit organized in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan. The summit, spearheaded
and supported by the World Bank since 2014, grew out of an idea of bringing
together the next generation of digital innovators to educate and inspire youth in
a conflict-affected region where 50 percent of people are under 30.
Given a lack of infrastructure and an anemic private sector in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the World Bank and the provincial government are working together
to promote the digital economy as an avenue for job creation. The prevalence of
mobile broadband and devices has led to increasing internet connectivity, creating opportunities in digital freelancing, entrepreneurship, and business process
outsourcing (BPO) to drive job creation and boost prosperity for young women
and men. Several burgeoning local firms have already grown to become successful
job-creating ventures with clients across Pakistan.
The summit also brings potential investors from the outsourcing industry to
showcase new initiatives planned in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa—most notably BPOready spaces in Peshawar, as well as Pakistan Digital City, an outsourcing facility
planned in Haripur that will accommodate around 5,000 outsourcing jobs. Both
the BPO-ready spaces and Pakistan Digital City are being supported by World Bank
funding and technical assistance, and investors are ready to invest, attracted by the
abundance of competitive and dynamic labor and available facilities.

Strengthening Operations,
Policies, and Processes

The World Bank is firmly committed to becoming an organization that is more agile,
efficient, and effective. Over the past fiscal year, it has continued to improve its
operations, policies, and processes to better serve its member countries.

The Agile Bank Program
The Agile Bank Program was launched in late 2016 to improve ways of working and
promote a culture of continuous improvement through a staff-driven approach.
Its goal is to enhance client value through more efficient resource allocation and
empowered staff.
The Agile approach is an iterative process to make continuous improvement
through incremental gains. New ideas are incubated, tested, rolled out if they work,
and discarded if they do not. In fiscal 2018, a community of 200 Agile Champions—
from across all operational units—was established to accelerate the testing and
mainstreaming of the Agile approach. Although the program is still in a relatively
nascent phase, hundreds of staff were engaged through training, testing of ideas,
and awareness-raising activities. Task team leaders tested Agile innovations in over
230 operations, while more than 15 ideas completed the testing phase and are
being mainstreamed. These include more focused project documentation, streamlined meetings, and a more efficient way to co-create solutions with clients. Delegated restructuring and a new multiphase programmatic approach to lending were
mainstreamed and influenced by the Agile Program. Preliminary data from a subset
of pilot projects show potential improvements on project quality, staff time redeployed to higher value activities, and faster delivery of projects.

Simplifying the way the Bank works
The World Bank has simplified the way its staff works through streamlining, standardizing, and automating processes to make systems more user-friendly and information more easily accessible. Among these measures, expenditure management
processes have been simplified; 20 human resources processes have been automated; an eSignature solution has been introduced to accelerate the signing of
legal documents; apps have been developed to facilitate approvals, transactions,
and access to operational and administrative policies; and current budget information has been made available to all budget holders online. The Bank’s IT infrastructure has been improved through new collaboration tools, a personalized workspace,
and a simplified and decluttered intranet, while technology such as robotics is
being leveraged to render transaction-heavy processes more efficient. The Bank is
also implementing a shared services strategy to find further efficiencies.

THE WORLD BANK ANNUAL REPORT 2018

-----------------------Page 74 End-----------------------

Improving the design and use of trust funds
The World Bank manages a portfolio of 751 trust funds, which serve as an important source of development finance and partnership. Complementing IDA and IBRD
financing, trust funds account for about 10 percent of the Bank’s disbursements
to its clients, and they are critical to the knowledge agenda, financing about twothirds of all Advisory Services and Analytics activities. Although they provide vital
support, the purpose, focus, and alignment with the World Bank’s top priorities vary
among trust funds. The largest of them are clearly linked to high priorities for the
Bank. The long tail of smaller, highly customized trust funds—the 70 percent that
account for only 7 percent of the total value of the Bank’s trust fund portfolio—are
more fragmented, making a clear link to priorities and managing tradeoffs more
difficult. They also have higher transaction costs for their establishment, fundraising, governance, and reporting requirements.
The World Bank has been working to strengthen the link between funding and
strategic priorities and to improve efficiencies by organizing its portfolio around two
main instruments: larger trust funded programs (“Umbrella 2.0”), with a strong focus
on results; and simpler, more nimble trust funds using fully standardized governance,
reporting, and results features. The larger programs would lower transaction costs
through coordinated governance and reporting, and elevate the dialogue with partners around shared priorities and mutually desirable outcomes. The Bank is implementing these reforms in an iterative process. Roll-out of the new instruments will
start with a pilot phase in the second half of calendar year 2018, with lessons learned
informing the final design of the program, before a Bank-wide launch in mid-2019.
For more information, visit www.worldbank.org/en/publication/trust-fund
-annual-report-2017.

The World Bank Environmental and Social Framework
The World Bank is launching a new Environmental and Social Framework (ESF)
in October 2018. The ESF will progressively replace the current Safeguard Policies for Investment Project Finance operations, with the two operating in parallel
for about seven years. The ESF offers broader and more systematic coverage of
environmental and social risks, including issues such as labor, climate change, and
stakeholder engagement.
Ahead of the launch, intensive preparation and trainings have been implemented. Bank environmental and social specialists are working with government
officials, project implementation staff, and key stakeholders—including civil society, the private sector, universities and training centers, and in-country bilateral
agencies—to deepen their understanding of the ESF and its requirements. Internally, a management information system to track and manage environmental and
social risks is being developed, while guidance materials, good practice notes, templates, and other resources are being created and will be updated over time based
upon implementation experience.
Training is being offered to Bank management and staff and includes eLearning
and in-person workshops on application of the ESF through case studies. More
than 900 staff have completed the training. The Bank is also working with development partners to harmonize environmental and social risk management approaches
across institutions.
For more information, visit www.worldbank.org/esf.

	

STRENGTHENING OPERATIONS, POLICIES, AND PROCESSES

-----------------------Page 75 End-----------------------

The World Bank’s Grievance Redress Service
The Grievance Redress Service (GRS) is an avenue for people and communities who
believe a World Bank–funded project has caused or will likely cause them harm to
raise their concerns directly at the Bank’s corporate level. By fostering dialogue and
acting as a facilitator in conflict resolution, the GRS embodies the Bank’s emphasis
on proactive problem-solving and has become an effective complement to mechanisms at the project level and the Inspection Panel. Since its creation in 2015,
the GRS has collaborated with operational teams across the Bank in working with
complainants to understand their concerns, and identify and monitor actions to
resolve them. Building on its growing experience and track record, the GRS is well
positioned to support operational teams in early identification, assessment, and
resolution of complaints and in channeling knowledge garnered through this work
to help identify systemic issues and devise appropriate solutions.

For more information, visit www.worldbank.org/grs.

The World Bank Procurement Framework
The World Bank’s Procurement Framework, effective since 2016, plays a strategic
role in helping countries achieve better development outcomes in implementing
Investment Project Finance operations. It uses a fit-for-purpose approach to allow
countries to develop procurement strategies that are tailored to their specific needs,
unique characteristics, diverse markets, and project development objectives.
Progress has been made in the implementation of the new framework. All new
projects using the framework now prepare Project Procurement Strategies for
Development, strategy documents that assess a project’s operating context, the
potential impact on procurement, and market conditions, and help to develop
procurement arrangements based on these assessments. The use of Alternative
Procurement Arrangements, one of the framework’s new features to help countries strengthen their national institutions and improve efficiency, is also underway.
Bhutan’s Thimphu Thromde and India’s Power Grid are among the first borrower
agencies whose procurement rules and procedures shall be relied upon in future
World Bank–financed investment projects. Another new feature is the Hands-On
Expanded Implementation Support, which helps to expedite project implementation by offering additional Bank procurement support as appropriate. This arrangement has been used in an emergency health project in Papua New Guinea and
a disaster risk management project in Myanmar, and is planned for use in other
countries, especially those with fragile or conflict-affected environments.
To date, 202 investment projects valued at $20 billion are or will be subject to
the new Procurement Framework, along with 107 small recipient-executed trust
fund investment projects worth $137 million. To ensure smooth implementation,
several guidance notes to operational teams, borrowers, and the private sector have
been developed. Numerous global outreach efforts have taken place to disseminate
the framework’s new features, and participating companies consistently confirm
that it has helped to create a stronger enabling environment for business.

Maintaining a Socially and
Environmentally Responsible
Institution

The World Bank is committed to ensuring that the institution is on a sustainable
path. By implementing its Corporate Responsibility Strategic Plan, the Bank systematically addresses environmental impacts from day-to-day operations, utilizing a
set of Sustainability Principles as its guide. This commitment is also reflected in the
workplace environment that the Bank aims to create with its People Strategy and in
the expectations that it sets for staff. These concepts are embedded in the World
Bank Group’s (WBG) Core Values, which were refreshed this fiscal year.

Our values
The WBG concluded an extensive internal consultation to revisit its Core Values,
which define how Bank Group staff engage with partners and each other. They are:
•  Impact—We help our clients solve their greatest development challenges.
•  Integrity—We do what is right.
•  Respect—We care for our people, our clients, our partners, and our planet.
•  Teamwork—We work together to achieve our goals.
•  Innovation—We learn and adapt to find better ways of doing things.
A new Code of Conduct to integrate these values into the Bank Group’s culture
and work is being prepared and staff trainings will be revised.

Our people
The World Bank’s 12,216 full-time staff are the source of the solutions to the most
pressing development challenges. The current WBG People Strategy aims to build a
workforce with the right skills, in the right place, at the right time, and who can offer
the best solutions to clients, and to strengthen the employment value proposition to
make the World Bank the best place to work in development.
Working in challenging environments. The World Bank is on track to meet
its IDA18 commitment to increase its footprint in fragile, conflict-, and violenceaffected countries by 150 staff by the end of fiscal 2020. Support and incentives for
staff working in the most difficult places have been strengthened by tailored learning programs, close monitoring and management of career development, compensation commensurate with the assumed risks, and enhanced counseling support
and security infrastructure.
Increasing diversity and inclusion. In fiscal 2018, the World Bank Group
received the Economic Dividends for Gender Equality (EDGE) global certification

	

MAINTAINING A SOCIALLY AND ENVIRONMENTALLY RESPONSIBLE INSTITUTION 	

73

-----------------------Page 77 End-----------------------

for both its headquarters and country offices. The World Bank’s headquarters completed the EDGE recertification by demonstrating progress in the areas of senior
management gender parity, effectiveness of flexible work policies, promotion of
equal pay for equivalent work, and inclusive culture. The Bank also established the
Disability Advocacy and Resource Group as an affinity network for staff and family
members with disabilities to promote better integration into the WBG community,
create a sense of belonging, and encourage institutional support and acceptance.
Addressing harassment. Gender equality is one of the World Bank Group’s strategic priorities. Anyone who commits sexual harassment, exploitation, or abuse is in
clear contradiction of the Bank Group’s values. Although rules banning sexual misconduct are in place, the Bank Group is conducting an external review to ensure that
they remain in line with best practices. The Bank Group has recently clarified staff
rules regarding sexual misconduct, exploitation, or abuse. Staff members have also
been encouraged to more readily report cases of sexual harassment. Complainants
are provided with the necessary tools and support to assist them in recovering and
moving forward after experiencing such forms of misconduct. Preventing sexual misconduct is linked to the Bank Group’s core values of integrity, respect, and teamwork.
Supporting health and wellness. In a proactive approach to employee health,
the World Bank Group introduced online health and wellness services to all eligible
staff, retirees, and their dependents. The program is expected to improve personal
health outcomes by providing health risk management support. An onsite primary
clinic was established at headquarters that provides primary care services to staff,
dependents, and retirees, as well as urgent and preventative services to visiting
country office staff and dependents. A 24/7 multilingual crisis counseling hotline
was also launched to provide support to WBG staff and dependents worldwide.
Refreshing learning resources. New staff-learning curriculums were launched,
aligned with the Bank’s corporate priorities. The curriculums offer interactive activities to raise staff awareness, operationalize corporate initiatives, and further embed
learning into the Bank’s culture. Module topics include, for example, Maximizing
Finance for Development; the new Environmental and Social Framework; the new
Procurement Framework; the World Bank Group Products Learning program; and

Staff Conduct Essentials, including sexual harassment and conflict resolution. In
addition, as part of the Knowledge Management Action Plan to improve institutional
knowledge sharing, the Bank provides Knowledge Packages to project leaders at
the outset of new operations. This automated service, which uses machine-learning
technology, bundles highly-relevant, well-tailored knowledge for staff to prepare
the best operations for clients. To date, 540 such packages have been delivered.
Representing staff voice. Staff rights and interests are represented by the Staff
Association (SA). More than 11,800 WBG staff and consultants globally are members
of the SA. To strengthen its global reach, the SA continues to strengthen its Country
Office Staff Associations in 90 countries through its pilot program of Regional Volunteer Counselors. In fiscal 2018, the SA engaged in dialogue with human resources
and senior management, observing staff concerns about the compensation methodology to protect the employee value proposition and enhance career growth. It
also focused on organizational pulse checks on issues ranging from sexual harassment to health coverage, advocating to strengthen staff rights.

Our places
The World Bank actively manages the environmental, social, and economic impacts
of its internal business operations by striving for net positive impacts on the ecosystems, communities, and economies where it has offices.
Being climate aware. The World Bank measures, reduces, offsets, and reports
on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from its facilities, major meetings, and corporate air travel. The World Bank surpassed its GHG emissions target of reducing
facilities-based emissions by 10 percent between 2010 and 2017 and aims to introduce a new target in the coming year. However, between June 2016 and July 2017,
total GHG emissions increased by 4 percent from the previous year, in part due to
improved data accountability from country offices and increased business travel
in support of the Bank’s global operations. To offset direct and indirect carbon
emissions not curtailed, the Bank purchased and retired credits totaling 117,667
metric tons CO2 equivalent covering fiscal 2017. In addition, the Bank purchased and
retired Renewable Energy Credits equivalent to the electricity use at its Washington,
DC, offices. Details are available in the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) disclosure
305, and the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) 2018 Questionnaire.

Designing sustainable sites. In fiscal 2018, the World Bank Group Islamabad
office earned LEED Gold certification, joining nine other Bank offices with similar certified sustainable building standards. Overall there was a slight increase in
energy use in the Bank’s 135 global locations mainly due to greater reliance on
onsite generator fuel in the Afghanistan office and higher electricity use in the
London and Chennai offices.
Improving waste diversion. In fiscal 2018, the Bank piloted a bin-less waste
removal system and surveyed waste management practices in its Washington, DC,
offices. To date, the bin-less pilot has increased the amount of waste that is recycled
and composted, with only 20 percent sent to the landfill. Results from this pilot and
the previously implemented central sorting and composting program are informing
a new HQ-wide waste management standard. Across the Washington, DC, offices,
the waste diversion rate remained at 57 percent in fiscal 2018. Waste disposal rates
in country offices are available based on country context and currently anecdotal.
The Bank is working to strengthen this data point.
Building a principled supply chain. In line with institutional commitments to
gender equality, the World Bank Group announced a goal of doubling corporate
procurement from women-owned businesses to 7 percent of total procurement
spend by 2023. This focus on supplier diversity is one component of a sustainable
procurement framework currently under development to integrate sustainability
throughout the corporate procurement process. In fiscal 2018, the Bank Group was
also awarded a 2018 Electronic Product Environmental Assessment Tool (EPEAT)
Purchaser Award at the two-star level by the Green Electronics Council, a program
recognizing excellence in the procurement of sustainable electronics.

Ensuring Accountability and
Monitoring Operations

The World Bank holds itself accountable to its clients and shareholders through institutional mechanisms that monitor operational performance. These include the Corporate Scorecard, the IDA Results Measurement System, and regular opportunities
to discuss progress on operations with the Bank’s Executive Directors. The Bank also
benefits from the expertise of key units within and independent of the institution.

Independent Evaluation Group
The Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) aims to strengthen the World Bank Group’s
development effectiveness through evaluations that assess results and performance
and recommend improvements. IEG’s evaluations contribute to accountability and
learning and inform the Bank Group’s new directions, policies and procedures, and
country partnership frameworks. IEG’s Results and Performance of the World Bank
Group 2017 report assessed the Bank Group’s efforts to mainstream environmental
sustainability in its country- and project-level work, showing a 4 percent increase
in mainstreaming environmental sustainability across its activities. The report also
found that 73 percent of World Bank projects completed between fiscal 2014–16
achieved moderately satisfactory or better development outcome ratings. This represents a 3 percent improvement from the previous review period (fiscal 2011–13)
but remains below the target of 75 percent.
In fiscal 2018, IEG completed 10 major evaluations, each of which assessed the
World Bank Group’s performance and identified lessons for improving Bank Group
operations regarding a theme, sector, or corporate process. IEG also prepared two
country program evaluations (on Rwanda and Mexico), which reviewed the effectiveness of World Bank Group development support over the last 10 years and
extracted lessons for future engagements in these and similar countries.

For more information and IEG’s annual report, visit ieg.worldbankgroup.org.

Inspection Panel
The Inspection Panel was established by the World Bank’s Executive Directors as an
independent complaints mechanism for people and communities who believe that
they have been, or are likely to be, harmed by a project funded by the IBRD or IDA.
The panel is composed of three members from different countries who are chosen
for their international development expertise, and a small secretariat.

-----------------------Page 81 End-----------------------

During fiscal 2018, the panel received seven complaints and delivered to the
Board an investigation report on a case from the Democratic Republic of Congo.
Additionally, the World Bank’s Global Gender-Based Violence (GBV) Task Force,
created following the panel’s 2016 investigation into the Uganda Transport Sector Development Project, released its recommendations on how to prevent and
address GBV in Bank-supported projects. As part of its role in promoting institutional learning and improving the development effectiveness of Bank operations,
the panel delivered the fourth report in its series drawing on lessons from its nearly
25-year caseload. The latest report covered cases involving the issues of consultation, participation, and disclosure of information.
For more information and the Inspection Panel’s annual report, visit
www.worldbank.org/inspectionpanel.

Integrity Vice Presidency
The Integrity Vice Presidency (INT) investigates World Bank Group–financed projects for sanctionable practices, including fraud and corruption; pursues sanctions;
identifies integrity risks; and draws lessons for future operations, reflecting the Bank
Group’s ongoing commitment to fight corruption and prevent it before it occurs.
INT’s Integrity Compliance Office engages with sanctioned companies that are
working toward meeting conditions for release from sanctions. INT has strengthened its preventive role through efforts such as hosting integrity compliance workshops and working closely with WBG task team leaders to design measures to
mitigate fraud and corruption risks in projects.
INT plays a fundamental role in the World Bank Group’s robust two-tiered adjudicative system designed to fight corruption and protect the integrity of Bank
Group financing while offering suspected parties an opportunity to respond to
the allegations against them. The system’s adjudicators—with the Bank’s Office of
Suspension and Debarment and IFC’s and MIGA’s counterparts at the first tier, and
the WBG Sanctions Board at the second tier—review sanctions cases brought by
INT, provide due process to suspected parties, and suspend and sanction firms and
individuals found to have engaged in misconduct. In fiscal 2018, the World Bank
Group sanctioned 83 firms and individuals and recognized 73 cross-debarments
from other multilateral development banks (MDBs). Sixty-six Bank Group debarments were eligible for recognition by other MDBs in fiscal 2018.
For more information and INT’s annual report, visit
www.worldbank.org/integrity.

Internal Audit Vice Presidency
The Internal Audit Vice Presidency (IAD) reviews the World Bank Group’s processes
from an independent and objective standpoint to help improve its operations. In
alignment with the Bank Group’s strategy, IAD conducts reviews of new initiatives
and the most significant risks to the organization. Through the reviews, IAD provides advice on the Bank Group’s risk management capability, and identifies gaps
and weaknesses in internal controls. It works with management to develop corrective action plans, and follows up on those plans to ensure they are implemented by
the agreed date.

78	

THE WORLD BANK ANNUAL REPORT 2018

-----------------------Page 82 End-----------------------

In fiscal 2018, IAD conducted assurance and advisory reviews in development
operations, corporate processes, and information technology and data management. Some topics that were covered include the Bank’s Anti-Money Laundering
and Countering the Financing of Terrorism (AML-CFT) program, corporate procurement, and information security.

For more information and IAD’s annual and quarterly reports, visit
www.worldbank.org/internalaudit.

The World Bank Policy on Access to Information
Introduced in 2010, the World Bank’s Policy on Access to Information (AI Policy)
has made it a more effective development partner. Based on the concept that any
information in the Bank’s possession should be accessible to the public, except
for that which falls under a defined list of exceptions, the AI Policy remains the
standard for international development institutions. It has also provided the basis
for the accompanying open initiatives—including Open Data, Open Finances, the
Open Knowledge Repository, and the Open Archives—all of which make the Bank’s
work more transparent, accessible, and accountable.
For requests that are denied, the public can appeal by alleging a violation of
policy and/or public interest. The internal Access to Information Committee serves
as the first level for all appeals, and its decisions are final for appeals alleging a public interest ground. A second and final recourse for appeals alleging a violation of
policy is available through the external and independent Appeals Board, consisting
of three international experts.
In fiscal 2018, the Bank handled 675 public access requests for information and
received more than 3.5 million visits to and 20 million downloads from the Documents and Reports database.

For more information and to submit public access requests for information to
the World Bank, visit www.worldbank.org/en/access-to-information.

Deploying Resources Strategically

Prioritizing strategic interventions across the World Bank Group
The World Bank’s principal institutions—the International Bank for Reconstruction
and Development (IBRD) and the International Development Association (IDA)—
work in ever-closer coordination with the International Finance Corporation (IFC)
and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) to leverage the collective
strength of the World Bank Group (WBG) for the benefit of its partner countries.
The comparative advantage of the WBG comes from the powerful combination of
country depth and global breadth, public and private sector instruments and relationships, multisectoral knowledge, and the ability to mobilize and leverage financing. Collaboration across IBRD, IDA, IFC, and MIGA has grown over time, and spans a
range of activities at the regional, country, sector, and thematic levels.
World Bank experts are organized across teams of Global Practices, which focus
on key technical areas of development, as well as Global Themes, composed of
teams working to deliver on cross-cutting corporate priority areas, such as climate
change, gender, fragility, infrastructure, public private partnerships, and guarantees. Collaboration across these teams allow for the development of comprehensive
solutions for clients. The Bank’s teams work together with country-based staff, IFC,
MIGA, and country partners to prioritize the WBG’s program of financial, analytical,
advisory, and convening support, based on the Bank Group’s comparative advantage, the client’s priorities, and in response to development challenges highlighted
in the Systematic Country Diagnostic (SCD).
The SCD identifies the barriers to eliminating extreme poverty and boosting
shared prosperity within a country, and is carried out by the WBG before developing a new partnership framework with a country. The diagnostic guides the development of the Country Partnership Framework (CPF), which outlines the strategic
interventions and support on which the WBG and partner country will engage. This
process has been in place since July 2014, and as of the end of this fiscal year, the
WBG has prepared SCDs in 90 countries and new CPFs in 57 countries.

Maintaining budget discipline to maximize the use of
financial resources
The World Bank Group aligns its resources through an annual strategic planning,
budgeting, and performance review exercise, called the “W” process for its three
top-down decision points and two bottom-up input phases:
W1: 	Considering external factors and clients’ demands, senior management sets
strategic planning priorities.
W2: 	 Vice-presidential units (VPUs) review and respond to corporate priorities.
W3: 	Senior management refines the guidance on priorities for each World Bank
Group institution.
W4: 	
VPUs develop work programs in response to determined priorities and
planned budget envelopes.
W5: 	
Senior management for each institution separately review VPU-level allocations and agree on aggregate budget proposals. The Board reviews and
approves budgets for the next fiscal year.
80	

THE WORLD BANK ANNUAL REPORT 2018

-----------------------Page 84 End-----------------------

The World Bank Group has made significant progress in aligning its budget to
address development priorities, to reinforce selectivity and efficient delivery, and
to maintain budget sustainability. It has done so through a combination of revenue expansion and spending containment measures that include completing an
Expenditure Review that saved $400 million. The World Bank has also implemented
new sustainability principles and budget indicators that allow for administrative
expenses to be covered by revenues generated from operations, and realigned its
budget with strategic priorities. The Bank Group is committed to continued financial sustainability, strategic alignment, and efficiency.
During the fiscal 2019–21 planning period, the Bank Group will focus on priorities arising from the organization’s goals of ending extreme poverty and boosting shared prosperity, as set out in its Forward Look strategy. Specific priorities
include: support for client-facing work, particularly for the IDA18 scale-up and areas
affected by fragility, conflict, and violence, and for meeting the IBRD capital increase
policy commitments; the Bank Group–wide partnership to crowd in private sector investment and create new markets to maximize finance for development; a
renewed focus on human capital and on enhancing the Bank Group’s leadership
on global issues; and improvement of the business model for greater effectiveness
and efficiency.

IBRD financial commitments and services
IBRD is a global development cooperative owned by its 189 member countries.
As the largest multilateral development bank in the world, it provides loans, guarantees, risk management products, and advisory services to middle-income and
creditworthy low-income countries, and coordinates responses to regional and
­
global challenges.
In fiscal 2018, new IBRD lending commitments amounted to $23.0 billion for
124 operations, of which two were IBRD and IDA blended operations.

For monitoring, reporting, and better decision making about its commitments,
the World Bank applies a taxonomy of codes to all lending operations to reflect the
sectors and themes into which it directs its resources. Sector codes reflect highlevel groupings of economic activities based on the types of goods and services
produced, and are used to indicate which part of the economy is supported by
the Bank’s intervention. Theme codes reflect the goals and objectives of Banksupported activities and are used to capture the Bank’s support to the Sustainable
Development Goals.

IBRD financial resources and financial model
To fund development projects in member countries, IBRD finances its loans from its
own equity and from money borrowed in the capital markets through the issuance
of IBRD bonds. IBRD is rated Aaa by Moody’s and AAA by Standard & Poor’s, and
investors view its bonds as high-quality securities. Its funding strategy is aimed at
achieving the best long-term value on a sustainable basis for borrowing members.
IBRD’s ability to intermediate the funds it raises in international capital markets to
developing member countries is important in helping to achieve its goals.
All IBRD bonds support sustainable development. IBRD issues its securities
through both global offerings and bond issues tailored to the needs of specific markets or investor types. Its bonds connect the private and public sectors to the IBRD’s
development goals through investors such as asset managers, insurance companies,
pension funds, central banks, corporations, and bank treasuries from around the
world. IBRD issues bonds to investors in various currencies, maturities, and markets,
and at fixed and variable terms. It often opens new markets for international investors by issuing new products or bonds in emerging market currencies. IBRD’s annual
funding volumes vary from year to year.
IBRD’s strategy has enabled it to borrow at favorable market terms and pass the
savings on to its borrowing members. Funds not immediately deployed for lending
are held in IBRD’s investment portfolio to provide liquidity for its operations. In fiscal
2018, IBRD raised US dollar equivalent (USDeq) $36.0 billion by issuing bonds in
27 currencies.
As a cooperative institution, IBRD seeks not to maximize profit but to earn
enough income to ensure its financial strength and sustain its development activities. Of fiscal 2018 allocable net income, the Executive Directors recommended
to the Board of Governors the transfer of $248 million to IDA and the allocation of
$913 million to the General Reserve. As part of its lending, borrowing, and investment
activities, IBRD is exposed to market, counterparty, country credit, and operational

and supports the institutional decision-making process via dedicated risk committees. In addition, IBRD has put in place a strong risk management framework, which
supports management in its oversight functions. The framework is designed to
enable and support IBRD in achieving its goals in a financially sustainable manner.
One summary measure of IBRD’s risk profile is the ratio of equity to loans, which is
closely managed in line with its financial and risk outlook. This ratio stood at 22.9
percent as of June 30, 2018.
At the 2018 Spring Meetings, the Development Committee of the Board of Governors endorsed a package of measures that include a $13 billion paid-in capital
increase for the World Bank Group, including $7.5 billion for IBRD, as well as a $52.6
billion increase in callable capital for IBRD. The boost in capital is augmented by a
broad range of internal measures to create an even stronger World Bank Group.

IDA financial commitments and services
The International Development Association (IDA) is the world’s largest multilateral
source of concessional financing for the poorest countries. It provides financing in
the form of development loans, grants, and guarantees to support these countries’
efforts to increase economic growth, reduce poverty, and improve the living conditions of the poor.
In fiscal 2018, 75 countries were eligible for IDA assistance. In addition, three
countries—Bolivia, Sri Lanka, and Vietnam, which graduated at the end of the IDA17
cycle—are receiving exceptional transitional support from IDA. New IDA lending
commitments amounted to $24.0 billion for 207 operations, of which two were
IBRD and IDA blended operations. These commitments included $18.5 billion in
credits, $5.0 billion in grants, and $463 million in guarantees. In addition, 12 projects and one program were supported under the IDA18 IFC-MIGA Private Sector
Window (PSW) for a total of $185 million.

For monitoring, reporting, and better decision making about its commitments,
the World Bank applies a taxonomy of codes to all lending operations to reflect the
sectors and themes into which it directs its resources. Sector codes reflect highlevel groupings of economic activities based on the types of goods and services
produced, and are used to indicate which part of the economy is supported by
the Bank’s intervention. Theme codes reflect the goals and objectives of Bank-supported activities and are used to capture the Bank’s support to the Sustainable
Development Goals.

IDA financial resources and financial model
Traditionally, IDA has been funded largely by contributions from high- and middleincome partner countries. Additional financing comes from transfers from IBRD’s
net income, grants from IFC, and borrowers’ repayments of earlier IDA credits. As
part of the groundbreaking IDA18 package, IDA shareholders agreed to transform
IDA’s financing model, leveraging its strong capital base to pioneer a new model for
development finance that combines donor funding with funding raised in the capital markets. IDA received its first-ever public credit rating—triple-A—in 2016. IDA’s
financial strength is based on its robust capital position and shareholder support,
as well as on its prudent financial policies and practices, which help to maintain its
triple-A credit rating.
On April 17, 2018, for the first time, IDA issued $1.5 billion of debt in the international capital markets. This inaugural IDA bond received strong reception in the
market, with total orders reaching $4.6 billion from around the world. IDA’s borrowing program will enable IDA to significantly scale up its support toward achieving
the Sustainable Development Goals, while offering investors an efficient way to
contribute to global development.
Every three years, development partners meet to review IDA’s policies, assess
its financial capacity, agree on the amount of financing for the next replenishment period, and commit to additional contributions of equity that are required
to meet IDA’s objectives and development goals. The Financing Framework for the
IDA18 Replenishment, which covers fiscal 2018–2020, is managed predominantly
in Special Drawing Rights (SDRs). US dollar equivalent figures given here are calculated using the IDA18 reference exchange rates. Development partners agreed
to a financing envelope of $75 billion (equivalent to SDR 53 billion) to provide
credits, grants, and guarantees to IDA’s client countries. Of this amount, $63.5 billion is expected to be used on concessional terms, $9 billion on IBRD terms for the
Scale-Up Facility and transitional support, and $2.5 billion for the PSW. IDA administrative expenses are recovered primarily through the net charges and interest paid
by recipient countries.

To support IDA18 financing, a total of 55 partners—five of which are new or
re-engaged contributing partners—have agreed to provide SDR 16.1 billion (equivalent to $22.6 billion) in grants, of which SDR 0.9 billion ($1.2 billion) is the grant
element from concessional partner loan contributions. Partners are also providing
SDR 3.6 billion ($5.1 billion) in concessional partner loans, or SDR 2.7 billion ($3.8
billion) excluding the grant element of the loans, and SDR 2.9 billion ($4.1 billion) in
compensation for debt relief under the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative.
IDA18’s effectiveness was achieved in November 2017, when 60 percent of the
partner Instruments of Commitment (IoCs) and concessional loan agreements were
received. As of June 30, 2018, 48 partners had submitted IDA18 IoCs and concessional loan agreements. Resources in the amount of SDR 29.0 billion (equivalent
to $40.6 billion) have been released and made available for commitments to date.

Focusing on the implications of global political and economic
policy uncertainties
The World Bank Group’s Chief Risk Officer monitors the global political and economic impacts that could affect the institution’s finances. In fiscal 2018, economic
growth in advanced economies reaccelerated, while activity in developing countries also rebounded. Uncertainty, however, remained significant, with the potential
for financial market turbulence from the following possible areas.
Policy uncertainty in some advanced and larger developing economies continues to present an overarching risk, and there is a significant chance that economic
activity could diverge from the forecast of continued strengthening of global activity. Similarly, geopolitical tensions remain elevated, with potential impacts on financial market confidence and volatility.
Trade growth is picking up after two years of marked weakness, although this
comes against the backdrop of new protectionist measures, prompting two key
concerns: first, whether measures are narrowly focused and largely bilateral or
whether they will be applied more generally; second, whether affected countries
respond with retaliatory trade measures setting off a cycle of escalation. Countries with open economies and dependent on trade, including many low-income
countries, would be among the most vulnerable. Increased protectionism could also
impact foreign direct investment flows to developing countries.
The policy stance of major central banks as they move at varying paces to normalize monetary policy is another source of uncertainty. Market interest rate expectations
could adjust abruptly in response to higher inflation or fiscal policy developments,
affecting both interest rates and risk appetite. The most vulnerable countries are
those dependent on investments to finance large current accounts and/or fiscal
imbalances. Divergence from monetary policy expectations could also lead to further
exchange rate movements. Corporate sectors that need to service large unhedged
foreign currency borrowing could face stress in the face of sharp exchange rate
moves. In some countries, large contingent liabilities could also be a source of risk.

Committed to Results
The World Bank helps to promote sustainable development in partner countries by providing financing, sharing knowledge, and working with the public and private sectors. Delivering integrated solutions to help countries address their development challenges requires a
focus on results. In recent years, the Bank has made important contributions across many
areas to support development results achieved by its partner countries.
