 having a measurable economic, social or environmental
 impact. From our headquarters in London and our network
 of Resident Offices, we work mainly with private clients,
 although we also finance public companies and municipal
 entities in support of projects that deliver essential
 infrastructure and services. EBRD loans and equity
 investments follow sound-banking principles, ensuring
 that the returns are commensurate with the risks, and
 finance projects that would not be funded solely by
 commercial banks.
 Founded in 1991, we are owned by 69 countries, as well as
 the European Union and the European Investment Bank.

President’s message
Multiple records were broken in 2019, making it a stellar year for the European
Bank for Reconstruction and Development. The Bank increased its impact in
the 38 economies where it operates, putting in the best performance in an
almost 30-year history.

investors in renewable energy, strengthening the investment
climate in Central Asia and improving policies and institutions
to enhance the skills of women, young people and refugees in
the southern and eastern Mediterranean region. Another key
achievement was the launch of the new EBRD good governance
policies developed with our partners – the Environmental
and Social Policy, Access to Information Policy and Project
Accountability Policy. These guidelines help shape and inform
our investments. I could mention many other such efforts, so
extensive is the Bank’s engagement.

No look back at 2019 would be complete without
acknowledging the skill and dedication of EBRD staff, in
Headquarters and across our regions, without whom such
results would not have been possible.

In addition to our operational achievements, the Bank is in a
strong financial position. We mobilised a record €757 million
from donors to support our projects, of which €378.5 million
came from the EU and a cumulative €194.5 million from the
Green Climate Fund, the Climate Investment Funds and the
Global Environment Facility. We also made a net profit of more
than €1.4 billion – our best outcome since 2007 and one that
reaffirms the EBRD’s financial sustainability.                    Suma Chakrabarti

    THE EBRD’S TRANSITION QUALITIES AND THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS




Our transition qualities and the
Sustainable Development Goals
Through investment projects, policy engagement work and donor-funded
activities, the EBRD promotes the transition to a well-functioning, modern
market economy. In particular, the Bank seeks to make the economies
where it operates competitive, well-governed, green, inclusive, resilient
and integrated. These are the EBRD’s six transition qualities.
As well as fostering one or more of these qualities, Bank activities are aligned with the 2030
Agenda for Sustainable Development, which was adopted by all United Nations member
countries in 2015, and its accompanying Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). These
constitute a shared blueprint for ending poverty, improving health and education and
spurring inclusive economic growth, while tackling climate change and working to
preserve our oceans and forests.
The work of the EBRD contributes to 14 of the 17 goals. The Bank provides
particular value through its support for Goal 5 (Gender Equality), Goal 6 (Clean
Water and Sanitation), Goal 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), Goal 8 (Decent
Work and Economic Growth), Goal 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure),
Goal 10 (Reduced Inequalities), Goal 11 (Sustainable Cities and
Communities), Goal 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production) and
Goal 13 (Climate Action).
Individual EBRD projects and engagements are typically associated
with specific EBRD objectives and SDGs, based on the transition
qualities that these operations promote and the economic
sector to which they belong. Throughout the Annual Review
2019, case studies will indicate, where appropriate, which
SDGs the projects in question support.

qualities – competitive, well-governed, green, inclusive, resilient      
and integrated – is helping to build modern, open-market
economies and support the Sustainable Development Goals
across the EBRD regions.

COMPETITIVE
The notion of a competitive economy lies at the centre of the transition process. The EBRD
promotes market structures that ensure competition between firms, aid innovation and incentivise
private enterprise, including in the SME sector. This encourages economic diversification,
widens choice for consumers and improves the quality of goods and services at fair prices.


                                                                                         SDG
New financing for reformed Moldovan banks
Moldova-Agroindbank (MAIB) and Victoriabank obtained
loans worth €12.5 million and €2.5 million respectively
and EU grant-based funding under the EU4Business-
EBRD credit line, which helps local companies do
business with EU countries. The financing followed
big improvements to the corporate governance and
ownership transparency of both banks. The EBRD also
extended trade finance lines to MAIB and Victoriabank to
facilitate international trade by Moldovan firms.

Egyptian agribusiness firm grows local talent
Using a €2.1 million EBRD loan and a €313,000 EU
investment grant, Farm Fresh will build a modern
factory in Alexandria with a view to increasing its
competitiveness. Support from Italy will assist the frozen
produce exporter in recruiting and retaining skilled young
workers and in providing them with work-based learning
opportunities.

Georgia, used a loan equivalent to €1.9 million to

The loan was split evenly with TBC Bank, a local financial
institution, under the EBRD’s Risk-Sharing Framework,
which increases access to finance for small and medium-

Helping Moldova secure winter gas supplies
The EBRD agreed to issue a letter of credit of up to US$ 50
million (€44 million equivalent) to guarantee the payment
obligations of Moldovan state energy importer Energocom.
The arrangement was designed to enable Energocom to
buy one month’s supply of natural gas from Ukraine in
case of winter disruption to its Russian gas imports.

Radiation levels drop at Russian nuclear site
Following the removal of spent nuclear fuel assemblies
from Building 5 at Andreeva Bay in north-western Russia,
radiation levels at the site fell by 40 per cent. The work
was funded by the EBRD-managed Nuclear Window of
the Northern Dimension Environmental Partnership, an
international donor fund that seeks to address the legacy
of the former Soviet Northern Fleet.

 BUILDING SUSTAINABLE MARKET ECONOMIES ACROSS OUR REGIONS




INTEGRATED
Well-integrated economies benefit from good energy, information technology and transport networks,
strong internal markets and institutions that are aligned with international norms. By promoting
integration, the EBRD helps the economies where it operates to grow and create jobs.

Road upgrade bolsters links in Kazakhstan
A loan equivalent to €190.4 million will finance the
reconstruction of a 217 km stretch of road between
the western city of Atyrau and the Russian border. The
project will also increase private involvement in the
state-dominated sector through the introduction of
performance-based maintenance contracts.

Model law puts people first in PPP projects
The EBRD’s Legal Transition Programme cooperated with
the UN Economic Commission for Europe in drafting a
model law on “people-first” public-private partnerships
(PPPs). The main goal of the model law is to assist
governments seeking to create or develop regulatory
frameworks of their own for public-private partnership
projects that promote the UN Sustainable Development
Goals and PPP international best practice.
