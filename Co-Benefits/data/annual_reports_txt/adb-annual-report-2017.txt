                               	Commitment is the financing approved by ADB’s Board of Directors or Management for which the investment agreement has been
                                 signed by the borrower, recipient, or the investee company and ADB. It is the amount indicated in the investment agreement that
                                 may or may not be equal to the approved amount, depending on the exchange rate at the time of signing. In the case of official and
                                 commercial cofinancing not administered by ADB for which the signed amount is not readily available, the approved amount is used.

                                 of the Asian Development Fund’s lending operations and retaining the Asian Development Fund as a grant-only operation.

        	            ANALYZING THE INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS OF ASIA AND THE PACIFIC

                                   Developing Asia, comprising 45 ADB member economies, needs to invest $26 trillion from
                                   2016 to 2030, or $1.7 trillion a year, to meet its infrastructure requirements (taking into
                                   account the costs of climate change mitigation and adaptation).

                                   Of the $26 trillion, $14.7 trillion will be required for energy, $8.4 trillion for transport,
                                   $2.3 trillion for telecommunications, and $800 billion for water supply and sanitation.
                                   Without climate change mitigation and adaptation costs, baseline infrastructure investment
                                   needs for 2016–2030 will be $3.6 trillion lower, but still almost $1.5 trillion a year.

                              Climate mitigation costs are estimated at $200 billion annually, primarily for investments in
        renewable energy, smart grids, and energy efficiency. Transport is also important in climate mitigation, mainly by
        encouraging shifts to modes of transport (public transit and railways) that reduce overall greenhouse gas emissions.

        The infrastructure investment gap over 2016–2020 is estimated at $460 billion annually. To bridge this gap,
        fiscal reforms could generate additional revenues, but additional financing will be required from the private sector
        and other sources. ADB will support regulatory and institutional reforms in its developing member countries to
        make infrastructure more attractive to private investors. The bank will also help governments be more proactive
        in promoting public–private partnerships, and assist in deepening capital markets to help channel the region’s
        substantial savings into productive infrastructure investment.

                                 In July 2017, ADB adopted its Climate Change Operational Framework 2017–2030
                                 (CCOF2030). The framework strengthens ADB’s support to developing member countries
                                 (DMCs) in meeting their climate commitments under the Paris Agreement, the Sustainable
                                 Development Goals, and the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Financing—including
                                 nationally determined contributions for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Through the

                                 of climate-related assistance. The CCOF2030 will help ADB underscore climate actions in the
        bank’s strategies, operations, and business processes. It will also promote DMC access to climate technology, support
        knowledge solutions and capacity development, and strengthen partnerships and networks throughout Asia and the
        Pacific. Under the CCOF2030, ADB has further committed to reducing its portfolio-level greenhouse gas emissions
        in line with efforts to limit global warming to 2ºC.

             ON THE MONEY TRAIL

                                           In 2012, Mongolia was named on the Financial Action Task Force’s list of high-risk
                                           jurisdictions, due mostly to deficiencies in the country’s regime for anti-money
                                           laundering and combating the financing of terrorism.

                                           	With the prospect of harsh sanctions looming, addressing these deficiencies
                                           became one of Mongolia’s most pressing developmental issues.

                                     ADB quickly developed and successfully implemented an innovative $720,000
                                     technical assistance package, with financing from Australia, Japan, and the United
States, to train authorities responsible for investigating and prosecuting offenses relating to money laundering and the
financing of terrorism. Utilizing a prominent team of specialists, ADB’s assistance improved the knowledge and skills
of 40 prosecutors, law enforcement agents, and judges in investigation techniques, criminal trends and typologies,
case preparation, and legal and evidentiary issues.

While Mongolia was able to exit the list of high-risk jurisdictions in 2014, ADB’s technical assistance continued
until 2017 and the bank intends to build on successful partnerships to further strengthen Mongolia’s anti-money
laundering and combating the financing of terrorism regime.

           BRIDGING LIVES AND LIVELIHOODS

Irimah Johnlee is a member of the lolo mamata tribe in East Guadalcanal, Solomon
Islands. She recalls the severe flooding of 2014, when 23 people died and 52,000 more
were affected by damaged roads, bridges, sewerage systems, and water supplies.

Irimah was also present on 23 August 2017 for the official opening of the Mberanda and
Mbalasuna bridges, for which ADB contributed $13.2 million. The bridges will boost access
to basic social services for about 39,000 people, while helping farmers and investors
capitalize on the agricultural potential of the Guadalcanal Plains.

“When it rains a lot, we will now be able to get to the market, schools, and medical clinics,”
Irimah says. “Before we could not. Our time traveling will be reduced, too.”

The bridges, approach roads, stream crossings, and culverts built by the project are
designed to withstand better the impacts of climate change and more frequent natural
disasters.

            A STITCH IN TIME

                                          La Sopheap lives in Kampot province on Cambodia’s southeastern coast. When
                                          Sopheap’s husband passed away shortly after the birth of their fourth child, she found
                                          herself struggling like never before to make ends meet.

                                          “I didn’t even have enough money to feed my children every day,” she recalls.

                                  The opening of a special economic zone, and two associated projects supported
                                  by ADB, helped change the equation in Kampot. Delivery of reliable and
                                  affordable energy brought 40 businesses and 10,000 much-needed jobs to Sopheap’s
  impoverished community. Her work as a seamstress is now providing her family with the economic security
  they yearned for.

  “I can feed my children and take care of their needs. We have better roads and better electricity, so my life is much easier
  than before,” Sopheap says.



                                                                                                       SO U T H E AST ASIA 39

           AN EVERBRIGHT FUTURE

                          In response to environmental degradation in the People’s Republic of China, ADB started
                          focusing its business development efforts in the country on environmental infrastructure.
                          After consultation with a range of stakeholders on how to support this goal, ADB began
                          helping state-owned enterprises access international capital markets to fund environmental
                          infrastructure.

                         One of the earliest projects in this area was a municipal waste-to-energy project with China
Everbright International. In 2009, the majority state-owned enterprise had limited access to international finance.
Following the successful implementation of a $100 million direct loan with $100 million in B loan syndication, ADB
supported China Everbright International to venture into waste-to-energy solutions using agricultural waste in 2012.

In 2017, ADB invested $10 million in equity to support China Everbright Group Limited (CEGL), the green energy
division of China Everbright International. As a cornerstone investor of the initial public offering, ADB helped build
investor confidence and demand.

With proceeds from the initial public offering of $385.6 billion, CEGL increased its agricultural waste treated to
6.6 million tons a year and its household waste treated to 1 million tons a year. CEGL now generates 5.9 terawatt
hours of electricity, reducing 300,000 metric tons of CO2-equivalent per year.

In December, ADB approved a loan of $100 million to China Everbright International to build and operate waste-
to-energy plants in Viet Nam. The project will help the Government of Viet Nam promote the use of environmentally
sustainable infrastructure, address the country’s growing waste management problems, and encourage private sector
investments in municipal infrastructure.

                	          ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK INSTITUTE

                The Asian Development Bank Institute (ADBI) is the think tank of ADB, providing intellectual insights and
                support for policymakers in the bank’s developing member countries (DMCs). It does so by conducting
                research on medium- to long-term development issues and providing capacity building and training (CBT)
                to help improve agencies and organizations engaged in development work within DMCs.

                In 2017, ADBI’s administration strengthened the institute’s finances by securing contributions from the
                People’s Republic of China for the first time, while attracting significantly increased contributions from the
                Republic of Korea. The institute also received a commitment from Indonesia’s Minister of Finance for new
                financing.

                Through its research unit, ADBI released 8 books and about 170 working papers in 2017. These covered
                infrastructure financing, finance and innovation for small and medium-sized enterprises, trade issues,
                financial literacy, and food insecurity in Asia, and ways for DMCs to avoid the middle-income challenge.

                ADBI delivered a record 51 CBT events in 2017, with increased emphasis on DMCs in Central Asia and
                the Pacific. Priority themes included poverty reduction, infrastructure financing, and regional cooperation.
                ADBI also began CBT on sanitation (supported by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation) and transport
                infrastructure (supported by Japan’s Institute of Transportation Economics). In May, ADBI hosted the
                successful Global Think Tank Summit 2017 in Yokohama, Japan.
