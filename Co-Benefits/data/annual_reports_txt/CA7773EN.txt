Executive summary
1.	

The Flexible Multipartner Mechanism (FMM)1 is the main global mechanism for
partners willing to contribute to a flexible, pooled and less earmarked funding in
support of FAO’s Strategic Framework. The FMM work in 2018 was guided by the
Programme of Work and Budget (2018–2019) approved by the Conference in July
2017 and the Adjustments to the Results Framework approved by the Council in
December 2017.

2.	

The detailed achievements of all 32 projects funded in the previous phase (2014–
2017) has been reported elsewhere.2 This report covers 27 FMM-funded projects
that implemented activities in 2018, directly contributing to the overall results
chain of four out of the five FAO Strategic Objectives (SOs), namely, SO1, SO2,
SO3 and SO4. The projects are linked to at least ten out of the 17 Sustainable
Development Goals (SDGs).

3.	

In this annual report, the results achieved in these 27 projects, the lessons learned
and challenges encountered in 2018 are briefly outlined. The FMM projects were
supported by generous contributions to FAO from the governments of Sweden,
the Netherlands, Belgium and Switzerland. This report does not include new
contributions received in the new phase, except for a few bridging funds (2018–
2021).

Main resource partners of
the Flexible Multi-Partner
Mechanism in 2018
The work reported here was largely an
extension of the implementation of projects
funded during the last phase (2014–2017),
and some bridging funds supported by
generous contributions to the FMM from the
governments of Sweden, the Netherlands,
Belgium and Switzerland.

4.	

In 2018, through two FMM projects
(Exclusive support to Voices of the Hungry3
and Support to Food Security Monitoring for
Sustainable Development Goals - SDGs4), FAO
supported countries in comprehensive
food security and nutrition analysis to
inform SDG planning. Updated series of the
“Prevalence of Undernourishment - PoU”
(SDG indicator 2.1.1) and the “Prevalence
of Severe Food Insecurity” based on the
Food Insecurity Experience Scale (FIES)5 at
country, regional and global levels were
disseminated through FAOSTAT and FAO’s
flagship publication The State of Food
Security and Nutrition in the World 2018.

5.	

The FMM launched an e-learning course on SDG indicator 2.1.2 (Prevalence of
Moderate or Severe Food Insecurity) based on the FIES in early 2018. The course is
composed of five lessons covering adaptation and inclusion of the FIES in national
surveys, data analysis and communication of results. User-friendly tools have also
been developed to assist countries to estimate SDG indicators 2.1.1 and 2.1.2.

6.	

The FMM also scaled up capacity development of national institutions to promote
country ownership of the PoU and FIES methodologies through regional, subregional and national workshops and technical missions conducted in 2018.

7.	

An evaluation of “the Voices of the Hungry” project was carried out by the FAO
Office of Evaluation and released in 2018 (available at www.fao.org/3/I9282EN/
i9282en.pdf). The evaluation found that the FIES is a robust indicator to measure
people’s access to food. It is also considered to be more cost-effective and easier

to include in national household surveys
than other food and nutrition security
(FNS) indicators.
8.	

The FMM also pursued the formulation
of voluntary guidelines on FNS under the
auspices of the Committee on World Food
Security.6 The information base to support
global policy discussions on sustainable
food systems and healthy diets was
expanded through the International
Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) and
the FAO Conference on Accelerating the
End of Hunger and Malnutrition7, and
the IFPRI–FAO Forum on Food Systems
for Reducing Obesity and Overweight
in Latin America and the Caribbean.8
Global political will and governance to
leverage legislation, national budgets and
improve policy implementation through
the Global Parliamentarian Summit were
strengthened in 2018.9

9.	

The FMM project Increase the Use of
Voluntary Guidelines on the Responsible
Governance of Tenure of Land, Fisheries
and Forests (VGGT) among Civil Society
Organizations (CSOs) and Grassroots
Organizations10 designed and developed a
fully responsive mobile course in support
of CSOs. An e-learning solution was
designed according to a micro-learning
strategy, one of the latest adult learning
trends, that foresees the delivery of bitesized contents that are manageable for
the CSOs partners and easy to access
from the field. The course has been
published on the FAO e-learning platform
and is available as a free public good.11

A total of 27Flexible Multi-Partner Mechanism
(FMM) projects were implemented, which
directly contributed to the overall results chain
of four of the five Strategic Objectives (SOs)
of FAO, namely, SO1, SO2, SO3 and SO4, and
directly addressed 10 out of the 17 Sustainable
Development Goals (SDGs).
In addition, the FMM fulfilled its main principles
consistent with its governance document.
•	 Catalytic effect: Most FMM projects
achieved multiplier effects including
mobilizing new funding, scaling-up
of activities and garnering greater
support from governments and
donors;
•	 Partnerships: All projects
consolidated existing partnerships and
also developed new ones.
•	 Capacity development: Various
capacity-building activities were
implemented in nearly 70 countries.
•	 Policy advice: At least eight projects
had a policy advice component with
concrete results.
•	 Gender mainstreaming: Most
projects have mainstreamed gender
in their work. In total, 16 new countrylevel gender assessments were also
finalized in 2018.

	The project supported a number of
activities in 2018 to enhance the capacity
of CSOs and grassroots organizations
•	 Innovations: A number of FMM
on the use of the VGGT. At the global
projects have piloted or demonstrated
level, the approach developed under the
new products, approaches and ideas.
FMM was incorporated into several FAO
programme activities such as the second
phase of the VGGT Umbrella Programme
(for more information, please see http://www.fao.org/3/a-i6820e.pdf) and the
Umbrella Programme for the Promotion and Application of the Sustainable Small-scale
Fisheries (SSF) Guidelines.

11.	

In 2018, the project on Sustainable Food and Agriculture (SFA)12 focused on national,
regional and global level follow-up of activities including finalization of documents.
One of the key outputs from this FMM project is the reference policy guide titled
‘Transforming food and agriculture to achieve the SDGs: 20 interconnected actions
to guide decision-makers’, which was published in 2018 (available at http://www.
fao.org/3/I9900EN/i9900en.pdf). This guidance document reinforced a common
approach to integrated policy support, capacity building and strengthening
partnerships to mainstream SFA in SDG implementation at the country level.
It also underpinned FAO’s support to the UN High-Level Political Forum on
Sustainable Development in 2018.13

12.	

Another important spin-effect of FMM funding to the Sustainable Food and
Agriculture project was the publication of the book Sustainable Food and
Agriculture: An Integrated Approach, which was finalized in 2018 (available
at https://www.elsevier.com/books/sustainable-food-and-agriculture/
campanhola/978-0-12-812134-4). The analysis supported by FMM under the
output on regional/global knowledge-sharing and learning draws upon leading
experts from various disciplines to provide a comprehensive overview of the stateof-the-art thinking and proposals for sustainable food and agriculture.

13.	

In addition, the project provided support to the global event on ‘Partnering
and networking: Second International Symposium on Agroecology: Scaling
up Agroecology to Achieve the SDGs’.14 A record 768 participants, including
representatives from 72 governments, 350 non-state actors and representatives
of six UN organizations attended the event. FAO presented the ten elements
of agroecology as a guide to transitioning to sustainable agriculture and food
systems.

14.	

Under the project Integrated Landscape Management to Boost Food and Nutrition
Security in Small Island Developing States (SIDS)15, three demonstration plots were
established in the selected schools in Samoa integrating conservation agriculture
and improved sustainable land management (SLM) practices. The engagement
of communities in the activities has resulted in community members joining the
Samoa Farmers Association (SFA), guaranteeing support beyond the project.

15.	

Under the Restoration of Degraded Lands16 project, assessment of restoration
opportunities was finalized in Cambodia in early 2018. This allowed creation of a
shared vision on restoration options between the multiple stakeholders involved
in the land-use sectors in Cambodia. In Guatemala, this project supported the
government in the implementation of cross-sectoral dialogue mechanisms and
raising awareness on the National Strategy for Restoration of Forest Landscapes.
In Lebanon, a comparative analysis of barriers to large-scale implementation of
forest and landscape restoration (FLR) was completed in 2018. This formed the
basis for strengthening the capacities of the Lebanese Ministry of Agriculture to
scale up FLR efforts in the country.

16.	

In the Philippines, the project organized a multi-stakeholder forum for knowledge
sharing on forest landscape restoration for incorporation in the government’s FLR
action plan. In Rwanda, a cross-sectoral task force on sustainable agriculture and
natural resources has been put in place as a think-tank mechanism for information
sharing, advocacy, policy advice and coordination of different interventions aimed
at enhancing sustainability of FLR efforts.

17.	

The project Blue Growth Initiative in Support of Food Nutrition Security, Poverty
Alleviation and Healthy Oceans17 supported activities around four work streams: (i)
development and implementation of methods, tools and policies for sustainable
aquaculture development and intensification in Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Viet
Nam; (ii) identification of management options for water basins to coral reef
ecosystems services in Kenya; (iii) improvement of the assessment and monitoring
of fisheries resources and related policy advice in Cabo Verde, Madagascar and
Seychelles; and (iv) development of seaweed farming and value chains in Kiribati,
the Philippines and Saint Lucia. Communication materials were also produced to
highlight the results of the FMM work including a booklet on Achieving Blue Growth,
a briefing note on the inclusion of marginalized groups in Blue Growth (available
at http://www.fao.org/3/ca0268en/CA0268EN.pdf).

18.	

Towards integration of agriculture in National Adaptation Plans (NAPs), three
FMM projects (National Adaptation Plans (NAPs) - CSA18, Building the Basis for Scaling
up Climate Smart Agriculture,19 and Climate-Smart Agroforestry Systems for the Dry
Corridor of Central America20) were implemented.

19.	

The National Adaptation Plans project, implemented in Malawi and Uganda
contributed to the development of global knowledge products on climate change
adaptation in agriculture. It also contributed to the final document entitled
Addressing Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries in National Adaptation Plans (NAPAg) Supplementary Guidelines (available at http://www.fao.org/3/a-i6714e.pdf).
The NAP-Ag supports government commitments under the Paris Agreement on
Climate Change and the SDGs.

20.	

Lessons learned from this project led to the development of a new FMM project
titled Integrated Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs)–SDG implementation
country support: Leveraging climate action and sustainable development through
low-emissions and climate-resilient food and agriculture systems. In Malawi, lessons
and seed funding provided by this FMM project formed the basis for the
USD 17 million NAP-Ag programme funded by the German Government under the
International Climate Instrument (IKI) Initiative.

21.	

Uganda has successfully launched its National Adaptation Plan for the Agriculture
Sector (NAP-Ag) in November 2018. The Uganda NAP-Ag framework presents
21 priority adaptation options in the key areas of crop production, livestock
production, fisheries management, climate information, early warning and
disaster preparedness, forestry, land and natural resources management, and
research and knowledge management.

22.	

The project Building the Basis for Scaling up Climate Smart Agriculture, implemented
in southern Africa and Viet Nam, provided the evidence-based information
necessary to identify the set of packages appropriate for adopting CSA solutions.
In 2018, two analyses of the potential for improving productivity, resilience and
mitigation for livestock production intensification options were conducted in
Zambia. In addition, a joint analysis of seasonality patterns in forages in Zambia
and Western Africa was conducted to improve the representativeness of the
assessments conducted with the Global Livestock Environmental Assessment
Model. This feeds into the joint analysis of climate impact on pastures and
livestock.

In 2018, two FMM projects (Integrated Country Approach for Decent Rural Youth
Employment21 and Enabling rural youth between 15 and 17 years of age to access
decent work22) contributed to decent rural employment (DRE). In Guatemala,
500 youths benefited from access to agriculture support services and
entrepreneurship opportunities through the Rural-Friendly Window model.
Similarly, in Senegal a dedicated training package on rural entrepreneurship has
been developed and used in six Modèle d’Insertion des Jeunes Agro-entrepreneurs
(MIJA) platforms. The package includes tools for the development of business plans
and guidance on rural entrepreneurship. As a result, 60 young agripreneurs have
learned how to enhance their businesses. In addition, 90 other youths have been
trained in agricultural production through the Farmer Field Schools approach.

24.	

Under the DRE scheme, the FAO Guidance note Child Labour in Agriculture in
Protracted Crises, Fragile and Humanitarian Contexts was translated into French in
2018. The guidance note was designed to inform the broader development and
humanitarian community. The FAO e-learning on child labour prevention and
youth employment promotion was further developed, adapted and promoted in
2018.23

25.	

In Lebanon, the joint FAO–United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) study on
‘Child labour in agriculture’ was finalized in 2018. A qualitative study titled ‘Child
labour in the Bekaa’ assessed the supply side of child labour in agriculture by
Syrian refugees. In early 2018, the findings of these two studies were presented
and endorsed during a session of the National Steering Committee to combat the
Worst Forms of Child Labour in the implementation of the National Action Plan by
the Ministry of Labour.

26.	

In Mali, the ‘Protect Children from Pesticides’ visual facilitator’s guide, originally
developed in Frenchwas translated into the local language of Bambara in Mali
(please see http://www.fao.org/3/a-i3527f.pdf). Similarly, in Uganda awareness
has been raised and the capacity of national stakeholders was developed on
preventing hazardous child labour. A visual guide focusing on the main risks
children and youth are exposed to in the agricultural sector and how to mitigate
these risks was developed in 2018 (please see http://www.fao.org/3/a-i3527e.
pdf).

27.	

Under the project Productive Investments to Create Decent Rural Youth Employment
in Migration-Prone Areas in Senegal24 seven studies were conducted to collect
information on migration, agriculture and rural livelihoods in 2018. The studies
also identified all technical and financial support mechanisms for migrants in
Senegal and provided a diagnosis of their organization, performance and impact.

28.	

Under the DIMITRA project: Reduce Rural Poverty through Information, Participatory
Communication and Social Mobilization for Rural Women, Men and Youth25 an impact
study and stocktaking reports were completed. Results of the stocktaking study
undertaken in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Niger and Senegal were
published in 2018.

29.	

Between January and May 2018, the number of DIMITRA Clubs increased from 1
900 to 2 500. This dramatic increase is directly related to the decision made by
country and regional projects to use the clubs as an empowerment, gender and
community mobilization tool in their projects. More than 25 FAO country projects
have incorporated the DIMITRA Club approach in several sub-Saharan African
countries, working on different technical areas.

In 2018, the FMM project “Agribusinesses and agri–food chains that are more inclusive
and efficient are developed and implemented by the public and private sectors”26
completed installation of electricity to operationalize three tomato processing
units in Tigray, Ethiopia. In Ghana, the project installed a fish-smoking platform in
Dzemeni, while in Côte d’Ivoire coaching and capacity development activities were
completed. An e-learning training package on gender-sensitive value chains was
also developed together jointly with the United Nations Institute for Training and
Research (UNITAR) and made available online by March 2018.27

31.	

The project Global Initiative on Food Loss and Waste Reduction28 supported activities
under the umbrella of Save Food. In 2018, the project held a training workshop
on food loss assessment in Kenya, and developed indicators and a monitoring
and evaluation (M&E) framework with the aim of helping the country to develop
policies and strategies for food loss and waste reduction. Food loss assessment
were also conducted in Zambia and Zimbabwe, contributing to the evidence
on which to base the formulation of policies and strategies. A regional training
of training on food loss assessment was also conducted in Cameroon with
participants from Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Côte d’Ivoire and the Democratic
Republic of the Congo.

32.	

Under the project Developing Sustainable Food Systems for Urban Areas (also called
NADHALI)29 implemented in Bangladesh, Kenya and Peru, the Rapid Urban Food
Systems Appraisal Tool (RUFSAT) (for more on the tool, see https://edepot.wur.
nl/468037) was developed and tested in Nairobi, Dhaka and Lima. The project
also established the food systems multi-stakeholder platform (MSP) in all three
countries to support the RUFSAT methodology. Workshops involving various
stakeholders in food-related issues were organized to develop a common vision
for the food systems strategy. The project developed the Food Charter in Lima,
which was signed by the MSP members in 2018 (available at http://www.fao.
org/3/BU650es/bu650es.pdf). The Development of the Food Systems Strategy has
started in Lima and Nairobi. As at the end of 2018, in Nairobi a complete draft of
the document had been developed. The FAO publication titled ‘Sustainable Food
Systems: Concept and Framework’ was also completed in 2018 (available at http://
www.fao.org/3/ca2079en/CA2079EN.pdf).

33.	

Through the project Linking SDGs 1 and 2 through Pro-Poor Inclusive Value Chain
Development in the Context of SIDS, 10 Pacific Island countries were made aware
of the World Programme for the Census of Agriculture 2020.30 A workshop titled
‘Planning and Conduct of Agricultural Census’ was held in March 2018 in Fiji to
build the capacity of experts from Fiji, Papua New Guinea and Samoa. The capacity
of National Statistics Offices of Solomon Islands and Tonga were also strengthened
to monitor SDG Target 2.1.

34.	

A section on ‘Pacific Food Systems and Fisheries’ was developed for the 2018 FAO
State of Fisheries and Aquaculture (please see http://www.fao.org/3/I9540EN/
i9540en.pdf). Case studies on the contribution of nearshore fish-aggregating
devices to food security in the Marshall Islands and Samoa were completed,
together with associated socio-economic surveys. Case studies were also
developed and capacities built in Fiji, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga and Vanuatu
on contract-farming opportunities and instruments.

Through four FMM projects, namely (1) Trade-Related Capacity Development in
Eastern and Southern Africa31, (2) Trade-Related Capacity Development in Eastern
Europe and Central Asia32, (3) Support to the development of National Action Plans
on Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) in Latin America and the Caribbean33, and (4)
Strengthening capacities, policies and national action plans on aquatic AMR34, FAO
ramped up efforts to strengthen capacity of governments to design policies and
programmes to facilitate trade.

36.	

Beyond the delivery of concrete results contributing to progress toward the
realization of the SOs, the FMM has fulfilled its main functions in terms of catalytic
effects, building partnerships, capacity development, policy advice, gender
mainstreaming, innovation and cross-sectoral work consistent with its governance
document.

37.	

FMM projects had strong catalytic and spin-off effects; relatively small projects
led to complementary or wider projects and attracted additional financing from
national or international sources. The Forest and Farm Facility (FFF) project is an
excellent example of the snowballing effects of the FMM as a small “seed fund”
(approximately USD 1 million), which helped to remove critical barriers and
leveraged larger resources (Figure 1). As a result of the successful implementation
of the pilot phase, the Forests and Farm Facility project secured an additional
USD 18 million for Phase II (2018–2022). In Guatemala, FFF helped the FAO
Country Representation to secure USD 7 million from the Korean International
Cooperation Agency (KOICA) for three years (2019–2021).

Catalytic effect of seed money from FMM to the FFF project.

38.	

In like fashion, the Restoration of Degraded Lands project is a further excellent
example of catalytic effect of FMM funding. FMM allocated USD 3 million as seed
money to the Restoration of Degraded Lands project, which served to trigger
important dynamics and as catalyst to leverage additional funds from both
bilateral and multilateral donors (Figure 2). Such efforts led to the approval of the
Global Environment Fund (GEF)-6 Thematic Program “The Restoration Initiative”

xiii

-----------------------Page 15 End-----------------------

(TRI) in partnership with the International Union for the Conservation of Nature
(IUCN) and UN Environment for a total amount of USD 54 million with ”child
projects” in ten countries. The Forest and Landscape Restoration Mechanism
(FLRM) project supported the preparation phases of five national child projects
submitted to the GEF Secretariat in December 2017 (for a total amount of
USD 24 million in the Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of Congo,
Kenya, Pakistan and Sao Tome and Principe). In addition, the FMM supported
the inception phase of the project funded by the French Facility for Global
Environment (FFEM) for a total amount of EUR 1.8 million on “Restoration of
Forests and Landscapes and Sustainable Land Management in the Sahel”. An
additional EUR 5 million was mobilized from the German Federal Ministry for
the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety (BMUB) in support of
the Paris Agreement in six countries. Additional pipeline resources from GEF-7 on
restoration and food systems amounted to nearly USD 22 million.

Figure 2.

39.	

Developing Sustainable Food Systems for Urban areas (or NADHALI) is another
example of a project with very good catalytic effects. Besides increasing interest
among stakeholders, it has helped in mobilization of additional financial
resources. In Dhaka (Bangladesh), a follow-up proposal based on NADHALI raised
USD 12.5 million for a five-year project from the Dutch Government. In Nairobi
(Kenya), a further project will start in 2019 with Italian government funding that
will put in operation many of the actions recommended in the food system
strategy. In addition, a three-year project worth USD 2.1 million was developed to
include Kisumu in Kenya.

40.	

Several FMM projects consolidated the existing partnerships and also built new
ones in 2018. Examples of FMM projects that have been particularly successful in
building new partnerships include the Blue Growth Initiative, the Integrated Country
Approach for Decent Rural Youth Employment, the DIMITRA Clubs, the Agribusinesses
and Agri–Food Chains project and the Global Initiative on Food Loss and Waste
Reduction.

-----------------------Page 16 End-----------------------

41.	

In 2018, various capacity building activities were implemented in more than 70
countries empowering a wide range of stakeholders with skills and knowledge.
New training materials, guidance documents and e-learning tools were developed
or those developed in earlier years were adapted and made available to a wider
audience.

42.	

At least eight FMM projects had a policy advice component with concrete results.
Some projects also produced information and guidance products useful to inform
policy-making.

43.	

Over the years, most projects have mainstreamed gender in their work, and
a number of the projects implemented in 2018 had an explicit gender equity
component. FMM projects also continued to support the generation and
dissemination of gender-disaggregated data. In total, 16 country-level gender
assessments were finalized in 2018, providing governments and development
partners with an updated gender profile of agriculture and rural livelihoods. The
FAO publication Gender and ICTs – Mainstreaming gender in the use of information
and communication technologies (ICTs) for agriculture and rural development was also
produced in 2018 (please see http://www.fao.org/3/i8670en/I8670EN.pdf).

44.	

One of the most significant impacts of the FMM-supported projects was the
introduction of innovations. A number of FMM projects piloted or demonstrated
new products, approaches and ideas in the implementing countries. Outstanding
examples of innovations achieved by FMM projects in the reporting period are
briefly described in section 4.1.6.

45.	

In conclusion, the FMM delivered on the results planned for 2018 and helped in
demonstrating the value of a pooled funding mechanism. Some resource partners
already renewed their commitments in the new phase of FMM. These include
the governments of Belgium (2018–2020), Sweden (2018–2021) and Switzerland
(2018–2019), and new partners have joined, namely France (2019) and Italy (2019).
Other resource partners are also preparing or negotiating their new commitments.
Accordingly, the FMM has been redesigned and repositioned as a more flexible
funding instrument.

Introduction

1

46.	

The Flexible Multipartner Mechanism (FMM)35 was launched in 2010 as the first
instrument for a programmatic support to FAO’s Programme of Work and its
Members to achieve their development agendas. The FMM is FAO’s main global
mechanism for partners willing to contribute to a flexible, pooled and less
earmarked funding in support of FAO’s Strategic Framework. The governments
of Sweden (2010–2021), the Netherlands (2010–2017) and Belgium (2013–2020)
are the core contributors to the FMM and have continued to renew their
commitments. The government of Flanders (region of Belgium) also funded the
FMM during the first phase (2011–2013), and modest contributions were received
from Switzerland in 2016 and 2018. The total contribution to the FMM from all
resource partners during 2010–2017 was USD 75 million, of which 47 million
was received for the last phase (2014–2017). To date, USD 27.5 million has been
committed by FMM resource partners for the new phase (2018–2021). More
countries are negotiating their commitments in the new phase.

47.	

The main objectives of the FMM are: (i) to support FAO’s Programme of Work
consistently, with the Organization’s priorities including Corporate Areas for
Resource Mobilization and Regional Initiatives; and (ii) to allow flexible and
catalytic responses to agricultural, forestry and fisheries development priorities
at global, regional and national levels, while establishing strong linkages between
these levels. The FMM also has a number of other important roles, including (i)
scaling up successful programmes and projects to replicate or expand their scope;
(ii) reducing transaction costs; (iii) promoting capacity development, policy advice
and partnerships; and (iv) providing support to country-level activities fully aligned
with the United Nations Development Assistance Framework (UNDAF) and the
Country Programme Framework (CPF).

48.	

The FMM was designed to enable FAO partners to make contributions that are
less earmarked to a specific programme, but rather to priority programmes, thus
giving FAO greater flexibility to allocate the funds where they are most needed.
In particular, FMM provides funds to support the implementation of the Strategic
Framework to achieve its Strategic Objectives (SOs) in support of the 2030 Agenda
on Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

49.	

This pooled funding approach has stimulated cross-sectoral work within FAO, as
well as synergies and more integrated work. Cross-sectoral work is a prerequisite
to addressing global and multifaceted challenges, such as poverty, unemployment,
climate change and sustainability in agriculture. In addition, the pooled funding
approach adopted in the FMM has allowed FAO to support new programmes or
projects, which the Organization believes are necessary but underfunded, show
potential for transformative impacts.

50.	

Over the years, the FMM has supported 32 projects in over 75 countries and five
regions, benefitting hundreds of thousands of people around the world. Taken
together, the FMM has not only delivered substantial results in countries, but has
also helped make FAO a more strategic organization, better equipped to support
the SDGs and answer today’s global challenges. In the 2014–2017 medium-term
final report (please see http://www.fao.org/3/ca2716en/CA2716EN.pdf) and

-----------------------Page 18 End-----------------------

the evaluation produced by FAO’s Office of Evaluation (OED) it has been shown
that the FMM has worked very well during its existence, and it has proven crucial
to advance work in areas such as hunger eradication, poverty reduction, climate
change and sustainability in production – areas all at the heart of FAO’s work and
the SDGs.
51.	

In this annual report, the progress made since the 2014–2017 medium-term final
report, results achieved, lessons learned and challenges encountered in 2018 are
briefly outlined. It must be noted that during this reporting period, most of the
projects were on no-cost extensions and focused on wrapping up the activities,
disseminating results and finalizing evaluations and analyses that were not
completed in 2017. In some cases, the projects also helped in catalyzing resource
mobilization and scaling up of some activities. In preparation of this report, great
care was taken not to duplicate information presented in the 2014–2017 mediumterm final report and also not to miss out on activities that were carried out in
2017 but not reported in the 2014–2017 report. FAO is pleased to present the
results achieved in 2018 through this uniquely flexible funding mechanism in this
report.

52.	

FAO’s work in 2018 was guided by the Programme of Work and Budget (2018–
2019) approved by the Conference in July 2017 and the Adjustments to the Results
Framework approved by the Council in December 2017, as outlined in the MidTerm Review Synthesis Report (2018). Building on the lessons learned during the
Medium-Term Plan (MTP) 2014–2017, the results framework for the MTP 2018–
2021 was further strengthened through the incorporation of SDG targets and
indicators and through refinements at outcome and output level. The structure of
this report follows this revised results framework.

53.	

The results framework comprises five SOs with indicators, outcomes with
indicators and targets for the medium term (2018–2021), and outputs with
indicators and annual and biennial targets for the 2018–2019 biennium. In 2018,
a total of 28 FMM-supported projects (see Annex 1 and Annex 2 for details)
were on-going in over 73 countries globally (Annex 3), directly contributing to the
overall results chain of FAO’s four Strategic Objectives, namely SO1, SO2, SO3 and
SO4.

54.	

The firsts Strategic Objective (SO1) is Contribution to Eradication of Hunger,
Food Insecurity and Nutrition. SO1 has four outcomes. The essence of the FAO
strategy through SO1 is strengthening the commitment of all stakeholders to a
food-secure world and supporting them in turning commitment to action.

55.	

Under SO1, the FMM supported three projects (see Annex 1). The first project,
Exclusive support to Voices of the Hungry36, contributed to Outcome 1.3, while the
second project, titled Support to Food Security Monitoring for SDGs 37contributed to
Outcome 1.2. The third project, entitled Increase the use of the Voluntary Guidelines
on the Responsible Governance of Tenure of Land, Fisheries and Forests among CSOs
and grassroots organizations38 contributed to Outcome 1.1.

56.	

SO2 (Make agriculture, forestry and fisheries more productive and
sustainable) addresses the sustainable improvement of productivity in
agriculture, forestry and fisheries and related services in the context of an
increasingly stressed natural resource base due to increased competition for
natural resources, environmental degradation and climate change. Under SO2,
a total of seven FMM projects were implemented in 2018 (see Annex 1). Three
FMM projects, namely Sustainable Food and Agriculture, Building the basis for scaling
up Climate Smart Agriculture and Climate-Smart Agroforestry Systems for the Dry
Corridor of Central America contributed to Outcome 2.1. Two FMM projects, namely
Integrated landscape management to boost food and nutrition security in SIDS and
Blue Growth Initiative in Support of Food and Nutrition Security, Poverty Alleviation and
Healthy Oceans contributed to Outcome 2.1. The project Restoration of Degraded
Lands contributed to Outcomes 2.2 and 2.4. The project National Adaptation Plans
also contributed to Outcome 2.2.

-----------------------Page 20 End-----------------------

SO3 (Reduce rural poverty) focuses on addressing the political economy of
rural poverty reduction through a major emphasis on policy work, advocacy,
stakeholder participation and partnerships through four outcomes39. A total
of 8 projects were implemented in 2018 under SO3 (see Annex 1). The project
Integrated Country Approach for Decent Rural Youth Employment (ICA) and Enabling
Rural Youth between 15 and 17 Years of Age to Access Decent Work contributed
to Outcome 3.2. The project Productive investments to create decent rural youth
employment in migration-prone areas in
Senegal contributed to Outcome 3.1, 3.2,
3.3 and 3.4. The DIMITRA project and
Agricultural Services and Digital Inclusion
in Africa contributed to Outcome 3.1,
In 2018, a total of 27 Flexible Multi-Partner
while the project Boosting the Decent Rural
Mechanism (FMM) projects were on-going in
Employment and DIMITRA work contributed
73 countries globally, directly contributing to
to Outcomes 3.1 and 3.2. Similarly, the

57.	

Highlights of main achievements

•	 The FMM has been instrumental to the
generation of several of FAO’s global
knowledge products and flagship
publications including The State of Food
Security and Nutrition in the World 2018.
•	 Some of the projects have resulted in
catalytic effects including mobilization of
additional resources million for scaling-up
of FMM results.
•	 The FMM projects have also helped in
consolidating existing partnerships and
building new ones at the global regional
and country levels in 2018.

58.	 SO4 (Enable more inclusive and efficient
agricultural and food systems) has
four outcomes40. Agri–food systems are
shaped by the way in which the involved
actors, public-sector institutions and
private sector enterprises respond
to the challenges and opportunities
created by changes in consumer
demand. Through various FMM projects,
FAO is working towards ensuring the
transition to inclusive and efficient food
systems through the sustainable use of
available resources and engagement of
smallholders and economically small
countries to enhance the inclusiveness of
the agri–food systems.

59.		In 2018, a total of nine FMM projects were implemented under SO4 (see Annex
1). A total of seven projects, namely Linking SDGs 1 and 2 through pro-poor inclusive
value chain development in the context of SIDS, Inclusive value chain development
in Africa, Agribusinesses and Agri–Food Chains that are More Inclusive and Efficient
are Developed and Implemented by the Public and Private Sectors, Developing
Sustainable Food Systems for Urban Areas, Global Initiative on Food Loss and Waste
Reduction, Strengthening capacities, policies and national action plans on aquatic
AMR contributed to Outcome 4.2. Three projects, namely Trade-related Capacity

Development in Eastern and Southern Africa, Trade Related Capacity Development in
Eastern Europe and Central Asia and Support to the development of National Action
Plans on AMR in Latin America and the Caribbean contributed to Outcome 4.1.

3.2. Thematic report of key achievements
60.	

In total, 27 FMM projects were ongoing in 2018, and all of them focused on
finalizing pending activities for which commitments had been made. The results
reported in this section were distilled only from individual FMM projects that had
reported results in 2018, contributing to achievements of thematic areas under
SO1–SO4.

supported three projects under SO1 (see Annex 1 for details), namely, Exclusive
Support to Voices of the Hungr41, “Support to Food Security Monitoring for SDGs”42
and “Increase the use of the Voluntary Guidelines on the Responsible Governance
of Tenure of Land, Fisheries and Forests (VGGT) among CSOs and grassroots
organizations”43.

3.2.1.1. ‘Voices of the Hungry’ and food security monitoring for SDGs

5

Overview

62.	

Assessing the levels of hunger and food insecurity is essential for developing and
monitoring policies aimed at addressing this issue. Because no single indicator
can account for the many dimensions of food and nutrition security, efforts
to measure them have progressively led to the development of a variety of
different indicators. As FAO’s new Strategic Framework was introduced in 2013,
work began on the “Voices of the Hungry” (VoH) project as an effort to develop a
global indicator that could be implemented by all member countries. The project
name points to the Food Insecurity Experience Scale (FIES) methodology of
asking people directly about their own assessment of their food security, but it
also reflects the advocacy dimension of giving the food-insecure a voice.

63.	

The VoH project was implemented with the overall goal of improving policy and
programme response to food insecurity through an improved monitoring of
food insecurity by establishing a global standard for measuring the severity of
food insecurity based on people’s self-reported experiences and applying the
FIES at national levels to produce comparable indicators on the prevalence of
food insecurity.

64.	

In 2018, this FMM project supported countries in comprehensive food security
and nutrition analysis to inform national SDG planning. Updated series of the
“Prevalence of Undernourishment” (SDG indicator 2.1.1) and the “Prevalence
of Severe Food Insecurity” based on the FIES, at country, regional and global
levels were disseminated through FAOSTAT and FAO’s flagship publication ‘The
State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World 2018’ (SOFI) (please see http://
www.fao.org/3/i9553en/i9553en.pdf). The report was launched in September
2018, but a substantial part of the work contributing to the SOFI 2018 was
elaborated between January and May 2018 jointly with the International Fund for

-----------------------Page 22 End-----------------------

Agricultural Development (IFAD), the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF),
the World Food Programme (WFP) and the World Health Organization (WHO).
65.	

The project also launched an e-learning course on SDG indicator 2.1.2
(Prevalence of Moderate or Severe Food Insecurity based on the FIES in early
2018. The course is composed of five lessons covering adaptation and inclusion
of the FIES in national surveys, data analysis and communication of results. This
tool was designed to build capacity development in member countries on the
FIES methodology. The development of an e-learning course on the Prevalence
of Undernourishment (PoU) was also launched in early 2018.44 User-friendly
tools were developed to assist countries to estimate SDG indicators 2.1.1 and
2.1.2.

66.	

The project also scaled up capacity development of national institutions to
promote country ownership of PoU and FIES methodologies. In 2018, regional,
sub-regional and national workshops and technical missions were conducted. In
Zambia, a sub-regional advocacy and technical workshop was held in February
2018 for participants from 14 countries (Angola, Botswana, Democratic Republic
of the Congo, Lesotho, Madagascar, Malawi, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia,
Seychelles, South Africa, Swaziland, United Republic of Tanzania and Zimbabwe)
plus the SADC office. Similarly, in Bangladesh a sub-regional advocacy and
technical workshop was held in March 2018 for participants from six countries,
including Bangladesh, Bhutan, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. For
the Sahel region a sub-regional advocacy and technical workshop was held in
April 2018 in Burkina Faso, and participants from Benin, Burkina Faso, Cabo
Verde, Chad, Côte d’Ivoire, the Gambia, Guinea-Bissau, Guinea, Mali, Mauritania,
the Niger, Senegal, Chad and Togo attended. Country-level workshops and
technical meetings were also held in January 2018 in Viet Nam, in May 2018
in El Salvador, Pakistan and Panama, in August 2018 in Côte d’Ivoire, between
October and December 2018 in Afghanistan, Cabo Verde, Colombia, Nepal and
Thailand. In the Sudan and Tunisia, exploratory and technical missions were held
between July and August 2018 to support the Arab Organization for Agricultural
Development in building the capacities of the Maghreb countries for reporting
on Food Security within the context of the SDGs. Exploratory and technical
missions were also held in Bahrain in October 2018.

67.	

The evaluation of the Voices of the Hungry (VoH) project, carried out by FAO’s Office
of Evaluation, was released in the first quarter of 2018 (please see www.fao.
org/3/I9282EN/i9282en.pdf). The main purpose of this evaluation was to assess
the quality and relevance of the VoH project design and progress towards results
in order to (i) provide accountability to FAO, its members, donors and other
stakeholders; and (ii) provide evidence-based recommendations for improving
project implementation. The evaluation was conducted with the objective of (i)
assessing the relevance, soundness and effectiveness of project interventions;
and (ii) identify opportunities and challenges for its continuation.

68.	

The evaluation found that (i) FIES is a robust and cost-effective indicator to
measure people’s access to food; (ii) FEIS is a household-level indicator for
monitoring access to food based on people’s experience; (iii) discrepancies
between FIES and PoU require clarification, and questions remain about what
the moderate end of the scale actually measures in some countries; (iv) VoH has
been very effective in achieving its desired results, especially at the output and

outcome levels. By 2018, 22 countries had already incorporated FIES into their
national household surveys.
69.	

One of the challenges identified is insufficient communication, especially with
non-statisticians, which limits broad political acceptance and policy uptake of
FIES. The evaluation recommended that FAO should adopt a corporate strategy
to better communicate FIES in policy circles and among the general public.

Overview

70.	

The project Increase the use of the Voluntary Guidelines on the Responsible
Governance of Tenure of Land, Fisheries and Forests (VGGT) among CSOs and
grassroots organizations45 was implemented between 2014 and 2018. The
objectives of the project were to (i) increase understanding on the VGGT among
CSOs and grass roots organizations to boost their contribution to the multistakeholder platforms; (ii) strengthen partnerships for the wider application
and implementation of the VGGT at all levels; (iii) test the technical guide on
the “People’s Manual”; (iv) assemble and build on the feedback received on the
above technical guide; and (v) raise awareness, and train CSOs on materials
complementary to the VGGT, such as the technical guide for gender-equitable
governance of land tenure.

71.	

The VGGT provided countries with a framework for best practices in tenurerelated policies, laws, regulations, strategies and practices. For example, the
VGGT helped ensure gender-sensitive implementation in the context of food
security in Liberia and Sierra Leone.

72.	

In terms of capacity building tools on the use of VGGT, many of the activities
were finalized in 2017. For dissemination of the learning guide and information,
a handout was printed in 2018. The capacity development material was also
shared with the Bringing Organizations & Network Development, Oxfam Novib in
Chad, the Comité Permanent Inter-Etats de Lutte contre la Sécheresse dans le Sahel,
the European Union Land Governance Programme, the Responsible Investment
in Agriculture and Food Systems (RAI) team at FAO headquarters, the Forest
and Farm Facility, participants of the VGGT/SSF Stocktaking Meeting and the
Association of the Governance of Land, Water and Natural Resources (AGTER) in
2018.

73.	

This project also designed and developed a fully responsive mobile course in
support of CSOs to enhance capacities on the VGGT. The e-learning solution
was designed according to a micro-learning strategy, one of the latest adult
learning trends, that foresees the delivery of bite-sized content nuggets that
are manageable for the CSO partners and easy to access from the field.46
This solution allows the course materials to be accessible through personal
computers, tablets and smart phones and readily available for the target
audience.

74.	

In addition, a number of activities were supported in 2018 in each region. In
West Africa, support for policy dialogue related to the governance of tenure
of natural resources between CSOs and the regional institutions continued in
2018 with additional funds from the FAO regular programme. Specifically, four
Training-of-Trainer (ToT) events were carried out in four countries, including the

-----------------------Page 24 End-----------------------

Niger and Nigeria, and one regional dialogue in West Africa was implemented
involving CSOs and representatives from the Economic Community of West
African States (ECOWAS). In Asia, Village Focus International from the Lao
People’s Democratic Republic carried out a presentation on the VGGT to the
Lao Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade CSO network. In Central
Asia, a sub-regional workshop for CSOs was organized to further develop the
capacity of CSOs and grassroots organizations and to intensify and foster
VGGT dissemination and an exchange of experiences. The workshop was held
in 2018 in Kyrgyzstan with FAO Regular Programme Funds. A total of 48 CSOs
representatives from Armenia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia, Tajikistan,
Turkey, Turkmenistan, Ukraine and Uzbekistan participated. The workshop
also resulted in the development of a sub-regional platform of CSOs willing to
continue working together.
75.	

In Kyrgyzstan, capacity building was carried out by the Nomadic Livestock
Keepers’ Development Public Fund. In Mongolia, additional funds were secured
in order for the project to adapt the Learning Guide to the pastoralist context
and carry out four ToTs at local level to test and finalize the guide in 2018. A total
of 133 people from four regions participated in the ToTs. Furthermore, requests
were made for simplified material related to pastoralism. In Nepal, a capacitydevelopment workshop was held in November 2018 by the Self-Employment
Women’s Association to lead a five-day VGGT for 20 women community-forestry
users. In Sierra Leone, the Organization Culture Radio FM104.5 produced and
broadcast four radio programmes on understanding the New Land Policy of
Sierra Leone, registration of land right, land use planning and the VGGT. Culture
Radio also produced a documentary on the VGGT and the New Land Policy
for two television stations. The documentary and the radio programmes were
broadcasted in 2018, reaching an estimated 2.5–3 million people.

76.	

In Colombia, one ToT was carried out in January 2018 on the VGGT in
Viotá – Cundinamarca with the participation of 25 representatives of social
organizations. One sensitization workshop was held for 25 participants
with government entities on the opportunities of the VGGT for institutional
management in the context of conflicts over land use and tenure rights in
Bogotá. One sensitization workshop involving 40 participants was also held in
February 2018 for communities and CSOs representatives in El Cocuy and La
Paya national parks.

77.	

The document Capitalization on activities conducted under the Belgium project 1st
phase and the Case Study Template were also finalized in 2018. In addition, 17
country factsheets were published online in Colombia, Côte D’Ivoire, Guatemala,
Guinea, Indonesia, Kyrgyzstan, Liberia, Malawi, Mali, Mauritania, Mongolia,
Myanmar, Nepal, the Niger, the Philippines, Senegal, Sierra Leone, South Africa
and Uganda. These factsheets provide background information focusing on the
activities undertaken in the country and the impact of these activities on the
overall national processes for tenure security, as well as links to other important
initiatives taking place in the country on VGGT and tenure issues in general.

78.	

In terms of supporting national multi-stakeholder platforms, the following
activities were achieved: in Mali, FMM support to CSOs and multi-actor initiatives
has proven successful in ensuring VGGT-guided inputs to national debates
for the implementation of the newly promulgated Agricultural Land Law that

Flexible Multi-Partner Mechanism Annual Report 2018

-----------------------Page 25 End-----------------------

introduced innovations inspired by VGGT principles and also for the current
National Land Reform process. The FMM supported the activities of the working
group of the multi-actors platforms focused on implementing decrees on the
land commissions that were adopted by the Cabinet in March 2018.
79.	

In Mongolia, the People Centered Conservation PCC facilitated the working
group functions and identified their needs in order to mainstream the VGGT
in the country. A three-day multi-stakeholder workshop was held in April 2018
to increase the multi-stakeholder platform engagement. The meeting saw the
participation of 53 participants from the national and local government, CSOs,
research institutes, international organizations and projects and private sector.

80.	

In Colombia, ToTs were conducted for CSOs and sharing of experiences
undertaken in order to improve local-level land governance processes for
planning and enhance CSO knowledge and engagement in ongoing national
tenure processes.

Lessons learned from SO1-related FMM projects
81.	

The awareness-raising activities were effective in capacitating government
departments and CSOs in the use of the voluntary guidelines. In addition,
the capacities gained were key to ensuring an inclusive dialogue in the multistakeholder platforms and other ongoing processes. The strengthening of
CSO networks on governance of tenure also empowered CSOs in engaging
in dialogue with the government and providing meaningful inputs to tenure
policies and legislation.

82.	

The capacity built during the FMM project had a multiplier effect leading to
new activities and dissemination of knowledge at country level. The capacity
development workshops also resulted in increased collaboration between
organizations attending national and regional capacity-development activities.
Direct exchange of concerns, experiences and possibilities for solutions among
the participants also created the need and desire to create spaces where the
collaboration between organizations could continue after the workshops.

Challenges faced
83.	

The FIES and PoU methodologies are technically challenging for many statistics
professionals to learn, wherefore follow-up, remote assistance and good training
materials are needed.

84.	

Given the highly political nature of hunger and food security data, countries are
sometimes reluctant to disseminate figures.

3.2.2. Making agriculture, forestry and fisheries more productive and
sustainable (SO2)
85.	

9

Overview

In 2018, a total of seven projects were implemented under SO2. These
projects fall under five broad areas: (1) Sustainable Food and Agriculture; (2)
Integrated Landscape Management; (3) Blue Growth; (4) Land Conservation and
Restoration; and (5) Climate Change Adaptation.

-----------------------Page 26 End-----------------------

3.2.2.1. Sustainable food and agriculture
86.	

In 2014, FAO launched the common vision on “Sustainable Food and Agriculture”
(SFA) to address sustainable development in agriculture, forestry and fisheries.
The SFA has identified five interconnected principles for integration of
sustainability in food and agriculture and for integrating different subsectors
(available at http://www.fao.org/3/a-i3940e.pdf). The five SFA principles
are (i) Increase productivity, employment and value chain in food systems;
(ii) Protect and enhance natural resources; (iii) Improve livelihoods and foster
inclusive economic growth; (iv) Enhance the resilience of people, communities
and ecosystems; and (v) Adapt governance to new challenges. These principles
balance the social, economic and environmental dimensions of sustainability in
agriculture, and provide a basis for developing policies, strategies, regulations
and incentives to guide the transition to sustainability, while promoting
resilience through an adaptive response to shocks and opportunities.

87.	

The SFA offers ways to explicitly address the trade-offs and synergies that are
associated with sustainability. Over the years, SFA has helped to facilitate multistakeholder policy dialogues, understanding and application at country-level of
adopting integrated and multisectoral approaches at ecosystem level. The SFA
implementation was piloted in Bangladesh, Morocco and Rwanda through the
project Sustainable Food and Agriculture47 between August 2014 and May 2018.

88.	

In 2018, work under this project focused on national, regional and global-level
follow-up of activities, including finalization of the reference/guidance document
on “Transforming food and agriculture to achieve the SDGs: 20 interconnected
actions to guide decision-makers” (for the full document, please see http://www.
fao.org/3/I9900EN/i9900en.pdf). Presented in the context of the Council,
the Committee on Fisheries (COFI), the Committee on Forestry (COFO) and
the Committee on Agriculture (COAG), this reinforced a common approach to
integrated policy support, capacity building and strengthened collaborative
partnerships, so as to mainstream sustainable food and agriculture in SDG
implementation at country level. It also underpinned FAO’s support to the UN
High-Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development 2018.

89.	

89.	
The development of the book “Sustainable Food and Agriculture: An
Integrated Approach” was also finalized in 2018. The analysis was supported
by FMM under the output on regional/global knowledge sharing, and learning
draws upon leading experts from various disciplines to provide a comprehensive
overview of the state-of-the-art thinking on proposals for sustainable food and
agriculture.

90.	

The FMM provided support to the global event on “Partnering and networking:
Second International Symposium on Agroecology: Scaling up Agroecology
to Achieve the SDGs”48. A record 768 participants, including representatives
from 72 governments, 350 non-state actors and representatives of six
UN organizations attended the event. FAO presented the ten elements of
agroecology as a guide to transitioning to sustainable agriculture and food
systems. In addition, UN partners jointly launched the Scaling Up Agroecology
Initiative, to be implemented with multi-stakeholder partners over the next ten
years (available at http://www.fao.org/3/I9049EN/i9049en.pdf). In preparation
for the Symposium, FAO conducted an analysis of its work plan and projects.

Flexible Multi-Partner Mechanism Annual Report 2018

-----------------------Page 27 End-----------------------

The analysis showed that eight percent of FAO’s results planned for 2018–2019
are directly contributing to agroecological transitions at one or multiple levels.
Even more significantly, a further 47 percent of FAO’s work could be shaped or
modified in some way to contribute directly to scaling up agroecology.
3.2.2.2. Integrated landscape management
91.	

Integrated landscape management (ILM) is the management of production
systems and natural resources in an area large enough to produce vital
ecosystem services and small enough to be managed by the people using the
land and producing those services.49 Integrated landscape management is
an innovative approach to land management that reduces land use conflicts,
empowers communities, and achieves development objectives at the landscape
scale. The ILM approach is built on the principles of participation, negotiation
and cooperation. As such, it requires long-term collaboration among diverse
groups of land managers and stakeholders to achieve their multiple objectives
and expectations within the landscape for local livelihoods, health and wellbeing.

92.	

The FMM project “Integrated landscape management to boost food and nutrition
security in SIDS (Fiji and Samoa)”50 was implemented under ILM between
September 2015 and May 2018. Small Island Developing States (SIDS) generally
struggle with high levels of unemployment and poverty and rely heavily on
food imports. Because people’s livelihoods in SIDS depend heavily on fisheries,
tourism and crop production, climate change has the potential to increase
vulnerabilities and derail the development progress made over recent years.
Recognizing the disproportionate burden that climate change places on SIDS,
this FMM project was implemented in Fiji and Samoa in 2014–2018 with the
objectives of improving land management and land-use practices in the context
of increasing access to food security and nutritious food. The project also
aimed to increase awareness on importance of nutritious food and building
capacities of key government departments and farmers on best integrated land
management practices that support food security and promote nutritious food.

93.	

In 2018, three demonstration plots were established in selected schools in
Samoa integrating conservation agriculture and improved SLM practices.
Activities were not implemented in Fiji following a budget revision and a revised
accelerated delivery plan. The engagement of communities in the activities
resulted in community members joining the Samoa Farmers Association, thus
guaranteeing support beyond the project.

3.2.2.3. Land conservation and restoration
94.	

11

Overview

Deforestation and landscape degradation is a problem worldwide. Around 13
million hectares of forest were converted to other land uses or lost through
natural causes each year from 2000 to 2010. Continued landscape degradation
constitutes a serious obstacle to eliminating poverty and hunger, maintaining
biodiversity, and to the ability of farmers and local communities to adapt to the
impacts of climate change. This process of land degradation is also increasing
competition for scarce natural resources, and it threatens people’s livelihoods,
well-being, food, water and energy security and the resilience capacity of both
people and natural ecosystems.

-----------------------Page 28 End-----------------------

95.	

FAO established the Forest and Landscape Restoration (FLR)51 mechanism
during the 22nd Session of the Committee on Forestry in June 2014. The FLR
aims to help countries meet their ambitious pledges to restore degraded lands
made under the Bonn Challenge52 (a global commitment to restore 150 million
hectares of degraded land by 2020) and related regional processes. The FLR
Mechanism is built on the advantages of FAO as a UN agency with expertise
and experience in several of the land-use sectors and its extensive network
of country, sub-regional and regional offices. The FLR mechanism aims to
contribute to scaling-up, monitoring and reporting on FLR activities to the level
needed to meet the Bonn Challenge and Aichi Biodiversity targets, particularly
Target 15.

96.	

From 2014 to 2018, the project Restoration of Degraded Lands53 was implemented
with the objectives of (1) facilitating the planning and implementation of
large-scale FLR programmes at country-level and in pilot areas in Cambodia,
Guatemala, Jordan, Peru and Rwanda; (2) supporting resource mobilization
for the financing of FLR projects; and (3) developing monitoring, assessment
and evaluations tools and guidelines for FLR projects and programmes and
encourage their use. The project feeds into FAO’s Umbrella Programme titled
Implementation of the FLR Mechanism, and most of its activities were
developed in partnership with key global initiatives on FLR such as the Global
Partnership on Forest and Landscape Restoration.

97.	

In the above context, the FMM-funded project facilitated the planning and
implementation of large-scale national programmes in Cambodia, Guatemala,
Lebanon, Peru, the Philippines and Rwanda. It also supported the development
and implementation of restoration and sustainable landscape-management
efforts at the global and regional levels through knowledge management,
outreach, resource mobilization and the development of monitoring and
evaluations tools and guidelines for FLR projects and programmes.

98.	

In Cambodia, the assessment of restoration opportunities was finalized in early
2018 with the support of the FLR, based on an integrated and multisectoral
approach named Restoration Opportunities Assessment Methodology. This
allowed creation of a shared vision on restoration options between the multiple
stakeholders involved in the land-use sectors in Cambodia. The comparative
analysis of policies and legislations also allowed Cambodian partners to clarify
the role and responsibilities of the different stakeholders for the implementation
of FLR efforts both at national and landscape levels.

99.	

In Guatemala, the FMM project supported the government in the
implementation of cross-sectoral dialogue mechanisms through the organization
of workshops aimed at raising awareness on the National Strategy for
Restoration of Forest Landscapes.

100.	

	In Lebanon, a comparative analysis of barriers to large-scale implementation
of FLR was conducted in 2018. This allowed to strengthen the capacities of the
Ministry of Agriculture to scale up FLR efforts in the country. Field actions on the
ground in pilot sites also allowed showcasing innovative restoration models at
local level during the first semester of 2018.

101.	

In the Philippines, a multi-stakeholder forum was co-organized by the
Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) Forest Management
Bureau, which provided a forum for knowledge sharing on forest landscape
restoration for incorporation in the government’s FLR action plan.

102.	

In Rwanda, a cross-sectoral task force on sustainable agriculture and natural
resources has been put in place as a think-tank mechanism for information
sharing, advocacy, policy advice and implementation and coordination of
different interventions aimed at strengthening and enhancing sustainability of
FLR efforts in Rwanda. The Rwandan Government has committed to restoring
two million hectares of degraded land by 2020 as its pledge for the Bonn
Challenge.

3.2.2.4. Blue Growth Initiative
103.	

The Blue World – the world’s marine and freshwater ecosystems – provides
essential ecosystem services, biodiversity, food and livelihoods for hundreds of
millions of people. The concept of a “blue economy” came out of the 2012 Rio+20
Conference, and it is based on the premise that healthy ocean ecosystems are
more productive and a must for sustainable ocean-based economies. The goals
of the Blue Growth Initiative (BGI) are to maximize economic and social benefits
while minimizing environmental degradation from these sectors. These goals are
closely aligned with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, particularly
SDG 14.

104.	

Between January 2015 and December 2018 the FMM project “Blue Growth
Initiative in Support of Food Nutrition Security, Poverty Alleviation and Healthy
Oceans”54 was piloted in Barbados, Cabo Verde, Madagascar, Seychelles, and
Sao Tome and Principe. The project supported activities around four streams
of work: (i) development and implementation of methods, tools and policies
for sustainable aquaculture development and intensification in Bangladesh,
Sri Lanka and Viet Nam; (ii) identification of management options for water
basins towards coral reef ecosystems services in Kenya; (iii) improvement
of the assessment and monitoring of fisheries resources and related policy
advice in Cabo Verde, Madagascar and Seychelles; and (iv) development of
seaweed farming and value chains in Kiribati, the Philippines and Saint Lucia.
In 2018, a Blue Growth Dialogue was conducted in Madagascar with a range
of stakeholders, including the aquaculture sector, who agreed to continue the
dialogue.

105.	

Efforts for aquaculture intensification including seaweed farming were scaled
up and expanded in the Caribbean through a workshop targeting small and
medium-sized enterprises, which was well received by participants in terms of
improving practices and product quality. Workshops were held in the Caribbean
and Pacific to improve fisheries and aquaculture ministries’ access to Green
Climate Funds. As a result, one proposal from each region is being formulated.

106.	

In the present reporting period, communication materials were also produced
to highlight the results of the FMM work, including a booklet on Achieving Blue
Growth, a briefing note on the inclusion of marginalized groups in Blue Growth
(available at http://www.fao.org/3/ca0268en/CA0268EN.pdf). Presentations
on Blue Growth were made at various meetings and events, including the Blue
Week in Sao Tome and Principe and the Brussels Seafood Forum in Belgium, to
engage the private sector. Preparatory meetings for a Blue Growth Dialogue with
relevant line ministries of Bangladesh were also negotiated to take place in early
2019.

3.2.2.5. Climate change adaptation
107.	

The Plan of Action of the FAO Climate Change Strategy is an integral part of
the Strategic Framework and Medium-Term Plan (available at http://www.fao.
org/3/a-i7175e.pdf). Agriculture’s role in adapting to and mitigating climate
change has gained prominence in recent years. The FAO Climate Change
Strategy guides the Organization’s actions towards achieving three mutually
reinforcing outcomes: (a) enhanced national capacity on climate change through

Flexible Multi-Partner Mechanism Annual Report 2018

14

-----------------------Page 31 End-----------------------

provision of technical knowledge and expertise; (b) improved integration of food
security and nutrition, agriculture, forestry and fisheries-related considerations
within the international agenda on climate change; and (c) strengthened
coordination and delivery of FAO’s work.

15

Overview

108.	

FAO has been supporting countries to ensure the achievement of the Paris
Agreement through climate action in the agriculture sectors, giving emphasis
to the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) of member states. The
integration of agriculture in National Adaptation Plans (NAPs)55 requires
significant efforts in terms of capacity building and policy advice. Towards that
end, three FMM projects were implemented during 2014–2018. These were the
National Adaptation Plans (NAP) – CSA56, Building the Basis for Scaling up Climate
Smart Agriculture,57 and Climate-Smart Agroforestry Systems for the Dry Corridor of
Central Americ58.

109.	

The National Adaptation Plans project was implemented in Malawi and Uganda
from Aug 2014 to May 2018. In both countries national policy dialogues have
been established to identify the main issues of the agricultural sectors to be
integrated into NAPs. FAO provided policy advice and crucial support to ensure
that agriculture is part of the processes for adaptation to climate change.

110.	

In 2018, the above-mentioned FMM project contributed to the development of
global knowledge products on climate-change adaptation in agriculture. It also
contributed significantly to the final document titled Addressing agriculture,
forestry and fisheries in National Adaptation Plans (NAP-Ag) Supplementary
Guidelines (available at http://www.fao.org/3/a-i6714e.pdf). This project also
developed and launched a user guide for the Knowledge Tank for agriculture
sectoral adaptation to climate change, now containing over 140 serialized
information materials.59

111.	

	In 2018, lessons learned from the original FMM project gave rise to the
development of a new FMM project titled Integrated NDC-SDG implementation
country support: Leveraging climate action and sustainable development through
low-emissions and climate-resilient food and agriculture systems.

112.	

Activities in Malawi were wrapped up with a development of a case study titled
Strengthening capacities for climate change impact assessment and modelling on
the agricultural sectors: Applying MOSAICC methodology for national adaptation
planning in Malawi. This case study will be formally launched in 2019 and
provides a bridge to the NAP-Ag case-study series. The USD-17-million NAP-Ag
programme, funded by the German Government under the IKI initiative and
jointly implemented by FAO and the United Nations Development Programme
(UNDP), was built on the seed funding and early lessons provided by this project.

113.	

With support from the FMM programme, and the larger NAP-Ag programme,
Uganda successfully launched its National Adaptation Plan for the Agriculture
Sector (NAP-Ag) in November 2018. The Uganda NAP-Ag framework presents
21 priority adaptation options in the key areas of crop production, livestock
production, fisheries management, climate information, early warning and
disaster preparedness, forestry, land and natural resources management, and
research and knowledge management. The NAP-Ag strongly links to government
commitments under the Paris Agreement on Climate Change and the SDGs.

-----------------------Page 32 End-----------------------

114.	

The project Building the Basis for Scaling up Climate Smart Agriculture was
implemented from December 2014 to May 2018 in southern Africa and Viet
Nam. This project provided the extended evidence base necessary to identify
the set of packages most appropriate for adopting CSA solutions, including crop,
trees and other agroforestry-related options and livestock practices. Part of the
project focused on understanding the trade-offs and synergies between crop
diversification and livestock intensification strategies under climate change, and
barriers and drivers of adoption.

115.	

In 2018, two analyses of the potentials for improving productivity, resilience
and mitigation for livestock production intensification options were conducted.
Field trials on crop–livestock integration at the University of Zambia have been
carried out for a second season. The trials were designed to provide evidence
on synergies between crops and livestock and how to avoid competition for the
use of crop residues while improving use of manure as fertilizer. In addition, a
joint analysis of seasonality patterns in forages in Zambia and Western Africa
was conducted to improve the representativeness of the assessments using the
Global Livestock Environmental Assessment Model.60 This feeds into the joint
analysis by FAO’s Animal Production and Health Division (AGA) and the Climate
and Environment Division (CBC) of climate impact on pastures and livestock.
Analysis of the impact of climate change on agriculture was also conducted using
the Modelling System for Agricultural Impacts of Climate Change (MOSAICC).61

116.	

In Malawi, a half-day technical workshop was held to share with national
stakeholders the results of future climate scenarios and crop yield. In Zambia,
support was provided to the national climate and crop team (University of
Zambia, Mulungushi University, Zambia Meteorological Department and
Zambian Ministry of Agriculture) for completing the analysis and advancing the
technical report on crop yield projection under future climate scenarios. The
team consolidated the crop production data for all the crops, and completed the
analysis of the historical yield trend in 2018.

117.	

The FMM project “Climate-Smart Agroforestry Systems for the Dry Corridor of
Central America”62 was implemented in Mesoamerica, Guatemala and Honduras
from November 2014 to May 2018. The objective of the project was to support
the scaling-up of the Kuxur rum and Quesungual systems and sustainable
natural resources management practices in the dry corridor of Guatemala and
Honduras.

118.	

A revised manual titled ‘Silvopastoral systems in Honduras as an alternative to
improving livestock’ was produced. Capacity-building workshops were held in
Choluteca, Honduras, with participation of 30 people from public and academic
institutions, municipalities and producers’ guilds. A total of 39 ferro-cement
water harvesters were built, 25 banqueo systems were installed for drip
irrigation and 200 ecofogones were built in Honduras. A total of 491 families
planted orchards and received training in best practices in agroforestry, and
soil and water management. A total of 425 participating families were trained in
integrated management of orchards and agroforestry practices.

-----------------------Page 33 End-----------------------

Lessons learned from SO2-related projects
119.	

Among the key lessons learned in 2018, supporting countries on NAPs has been
instrumental in defining how FAO can support countries in medium to longterm policy formulation, adaptation planning and budgetary aspects. Another
important lesson was that implementation of SFA can be easier to initiate at
sub-national level around issues of sustainability that are already identified and
where a clear willingness of the local authority to address them exists.

Challenges faced
120.	

One of the greatest challenges faced in 2018 was the coordination of the
multiple ongoing climate and development planning processes, in particular
related to NAPs, SDGs and NDCs. The NDC and SDG agendas were generally
defined and advanced separately or under distinct national coordination
frameworks and led by different institutions. As a result of this separation
between planning and implementation tracks, there is relatively limited
alignment and synergy between the specific climate actions supporting the
NDCs and the national targets underpinning the SDGs. Countries face three
main challenges when moving from NDC planning to implementation: (i) lack of
available data and evidence to support decision-making; (ii) weak institutional
capacity to integrate climate and agriculture priorities within national policy
frameworks and budgeting processes; and (iii) limited technical capacity to
identify and prioritize climate mitigation and adaptation options and to monitor
the progress of their implementation.

121.	

Similarly, the country-driven approach of the 2030 Agenda presents new
planning and monitoring challenges in the agriculture sectors when national
and sub-national information systems and approaches are not harmonized
and human and technical resources are limited in handling the weight of 230
indicators.

122.	

In the case of FLR, the duration and the total amount of funds available were
not sufficient to implement the planned actions. For example, the funds
available for each country did not allow for the development of large-scale
restoration efforts in the selected pilot areas.

3.2.3. Reducing rural poverty (SO3)
123.	

A total of eight projects were implemented under SO3 in 2018. These projects
fall under the following broad areas: (1) Decent Rural Employment; (2)
Productive Investment on Migration; (3) Women Empowerment and Social
Mobilization; (4) Forest Farm and Farmer Organization; (5) Social Protection; and
(6) Digital Inclusion. The key results recorded in 2018 under each broad area are
briefly presented below.

3.2.3.1. Decent rural employment	
124.	

17

Overview

Over three quarters of the world’s poor live in rural areas and many of
them depend on agriculture to make a living. More and better employment
opportunities will need to be created for rural populations to fight against
hunger and poverty and for creating more prosperous livelihoods for the

-----------------------Page 34 End-----------------------

population at large. Workers with insecure jobs and those subject to hazardous
working conditions tend to be less productive and risk their health, which may
trap them and their families in poverty. FAO defines decent rural employment
(DRE) as work that provides a living income and reasonable working conditions.63
DRE being central to its mission, FAO actively supports countries to promote
decent employment in agriculture and in rural areas.
125.	

In 2018, two FMM projects contributed to DRE. These were (1) Integrated Country
Approach for Decent Rural Youth Employment64 and (2) Enabling rural youth between
15 and 17 years of age to access decent work65.

126.	

Through its Integrated Country Approach (ICA)66, FAO supports member states
in the restructuring of the agricultural sector and the diversification of the
rural economy to become more effective in creating better jobs in rural areas,
with a particular focus on the youth as beneficiaries. At the global and regional
levels, ICA contributes to development and sharing of knowledge, lessons learnt
and good practices, as well as to influencing regional and global initiatives on
agricultural development. At the country level, the main objective of ICA is to
enhance the employment content and youth focus of policies and programmes
for agricultural and rural development. In particular, ICA contributes to
increasing global knowledge about the differentiated needs of rural youth and
how the rural transformation process can create pathways out of poverty.

127.	

The ICA project supported by FMM is the second phase of a project implemented
from 2011 to 2014 in Malawi and the United Republic of Tanzania. The ICA
project aimed to provide strategic support to member states in this regard.
Lessons learned from the previous phase have been documented in a case
study focussing on the need to: (i) identify selected entry points for policy
advice; (ii) conduct careful scoping exercises and map champions, including
youth organizations; and (iii) invest in more cost-effective modalities such as
e-learning courses (for more information, please see http://www.fao.org/3/
CA2165EN/ca2165en.pdf). The project directly supported the development and
implementation of the FAO Regional Office for Africa (RAF) Special Programme
on Youth Employment: enabling decent agriculture and agri-business jobs. While the
majority of the activities under ICA were carried out in 2017, activities continued
and products were finalized and disseminated in 2018. Therefore, only the key
results achieved in 2018 are summarized below.

128.	

In Guatemala, following the launch of the Rural-Friendly Window model,
500 youth benefited from access to agriculture support services and
entrepreneurship opportunities (for more information, please see http://www.
fao.org/3/a-i7674e.pdf). Of these, 20 percent accessed labour orientation
or direct training support, 50 percent received external training offered by
partners, 5 percent found a job and 14 percent are receiving technical support
to start or strengthen their business. Following the launch of ChispaRural.
gt, a virtual hub where rural youth can access up-to-date information on
opportunities and resources offered by different suppliers, as well as practical
tools and inspirational stories of young agripreneurs, the project continued
testing the service that responds to the needs of more than 1 500 young people
and rural service providers in the department of San Marcos. Factoria del
emprendimiento, a business laboratory helping youth to start up communitycentred small and medium enterprises was launched with a territorial
development approach (Box 1).

Success story
Factoria del Emprendimiento, a business laboratory in Guatemala
FMM/GLO/100/MUL
Recent out-migration from Guatemala is one of the dramatic examples of decades of human
movement. A variety of factors are driving this migration. For example, in Quetzaltenango, a
region with one of the country’s highest rates of outward migration, the lack of jobs and low
coffee production have crippled employment opportunities. San Marcos, Huehuetenango and
Totonicapán are migration-prone departments of the Quetzaltenango region.
Factoria del Emprendimiento is a business laboratory and initiative supported by the Flexible
Multi-Partner Mechanism to help youth with starting up community-centred small and
medium enterprises. It was launched with a territorial development approach. In 2018, the
initiative has provided a three-month training programme on entrepreneurial skills and local
development to 75 young men and women, between 20 and 30 years of age, from San Marcos,
Huehuetenango, and Totonicapán. The Factoria has also supported the youth in assessing local
markets, defining alliances and formulating financially-viable project proposals. All projects
show a strong agriculture and livestock base and explore the potential of niche markets and
green entrepreneurship. Each of the youth-led enterprises engages 50 to 100 families from the
respective communities.

Overview

129.	

In Senegal, the ICA project continued supporting the MIJA platforms, small
rural hubs for proximity agribusiness support, where rural youth learn about
agricultural production, aggregation, transformation and service provision. A
dedicated training package on rural entrepreneurship has been developed and
used in six MIJA platforms. The package includes tools for the development
of business plans and guidance on rural entrepreneurship. As a result, 60
young agripreneurs have learned how to enhance their businesses, while
another 90 youth have been trained in agricultural production, using the
Farmer Field Schools approach. The MIJA initiative has ensured guidance and
support not only to the young women and men participating in the platforms,
but also to other youths in neighbouring areas. Overall, the six MIJA pilots are
expected to generate 1 500 direct and indirect on-farm and off-farm jobs and
to positively impact the livelihoods of 12 800 households. The MIJA model has
generated growing interest in Senegal as an effective approach to supporting
the engagement of rural youth in agribusiness. The Senegalese National Youth
Employment Agency (ANPEJ) has already committed more than USD 500 000
for the infrastructure work needed to maintain and strengthen the platforms,
guaranteeing the long-term sustainability of the initiative.

130.	

In Uganda, the ICA project continued supporting the implementation of
the five-year Strategy for Youth in Agriculture, developed by the Ministry of
Agriculture, Animal Industries and Fisheries, with the aim of re-engaging youth
in agriculture and creating more and better jobs along agricultural value chains.
Specific activities included trainings of youth in farming as a business and the
identification of rural youth champions who can act as role models for their
peers. The Strategy aims at strengthening the legal and institutional framework

-----------------------Page 36 End-----------------------

for youth employment in agriculture, ensuring the provision of youth-sensitive
agricultural extension services and creating national information centres that
will serve as innovation hubs. It also promotes safety and health standards at
work and the utilization of funds targeting youth for enterprise development.
131.	

131.	 A study focusing on rural youth between 14 and 17 years of age was
carried out in order to shed light on the education level and employment
status of an age group which is neglected in many policy interventions (for
more information, please see http://www.fao.org/3/a-i7484e.pdf). The study
revealed that the majority of youth in this age cohort dropped out of school at
an early age, most of them before having finished primary school. Moreover,
the majority are unemployed or employed in low-pay jobs in the informal
sector. Over 96 percent of them are contributing to family farmers and are
involved in agricultural activities, but they have limited or no access to decent
jobs opportunities. In addition, the project undertook an analysis of ongoing
initiatives aimed at boosting youth employment in agriculture in the country,
assessing their strengths and weaknesses, as well as innovation and replication
potential. Both studies resulted in a series of recommendations towards the
replication and scaling up of successful interventions, which informed and will
inform national strategic discussions on youth engagement in agriculture and
food systems.

132.	

The FMM project Enabling rural youth between 15 and 17 years of age to access
decent work was piloted between November 2016 and May 2018 in Cambodia,
Lebanon, Mali and Uganda. This project aimed to support the targeted countries
to have policies and programmes that better address the challenges faced by
rural youth between 15 and 17 years of age in preparing for and accessing
decent work in agriculture and rural areas. It also aimed to bring together the
work programmes on youth employment promotion and child labour prevention
and address this age group that is often neglected.

133.	

In 2018, increased attention was given to promoting healthy generations in
agriculture, reduce hazardous child labour and promote safe work for rural
youth between 15 and 17 years of age amongst all agricultural sub-sectors. The
FAO Guidance note Child Labour in Agriculture in Protracted Crises, Fragile and
Humanitarian Contexts, which was developed and launched on the World Day
Against Child Labour in 2017, was translated into French in 2018 (available at
http://www.fao.org/3/a-i7403e.pdf). The guidance note was a joint effort of
SP3, SP4 and SP5 aimed at supporting the integration of child labour and youth
employment issues for 15-to-17-year-olds in FAO’s emergency programmes.
This guidance note was also designed to inform the broader development and
humanitarian community.

134.	

The FAO e-learning on child-labour prevention and youth-employment
promotion was further developed, adapted and promoted in 2018.67

135.	

In Lebanon the joint FAO–UNICEF–International Labour Organization (ILO) study
on “Child labour in agriculture” was finalized in 2018 (available at http://www.
fao.org/3/a-i7721e.pdf). The study sheds light on the nature and the extent of
young people’s work in agriculture, and the institutional framework to address
the phenomenon. The study also evaluated how the labour market has been
impacted by the Syrian crisis and highlighted child-labour trends over the last

Flexible Multi-Partner Mechanism Annual Report 2018

-----------------------Page 37 End-----------------------

decade. A qualitative study titled “Child labour in the Bekaa”, which assessed the
supply side of child labour in agriculture by Syrian refugees was undertaken by
the American University of Beirut with support from FAO, the Lebanese Ministry
of Labour, ILO and UNICEF, and its draft report was finalized. In early 2018, the
findings of these two studies were presented and endorsed during a session of
the National Steering Committee to Combat the Worst Forms of Child Labour in
the implementation of the National Action Plan by the Ministry of Labour.
136.	

In Mali, the “Protect children from pesticides” visual facilitator’s guide (please see
http://www.fao.org/3/a-i3527f.pdf) originally developed in French in Mali was
translated, publicly released and printed into the local language of Bambara. An
awareness campaign was also implemented in the circle of Bandiagara by the
DIMITRA listeners’ clubs on the topic of child labour in agriculture. The campaign
involved 30 clubs in six communes. The strategy on the integration of younger
youth is being implemented to enable them to be part of the community,
to express themselves, and for their aspirations to be heard. A series of
recreational/socializing activities were identified (for example through theatre).

137.	

In Uganda, awareness was raised and the capacity of national stakeholders
developed for preventing hazardous child labour while promoting safe
employment for youth. A visual guide focusing on the main risks children and
youth are exposed to in the agricultural sector and how to mitigate these risks
was developed in 2018 (please see http://www.fao.org/3/a-i3527e.pdf). The
tool focuses on children and younger youth for all major risks in the priority
value chains identified, and will also illustrate mitigation techniques.

3.2.3.2. Productive investment on migration

21

Overview

138.	

	Migration can be an engine of economic growth and innovation, and it can
greatly contribute to sustainable development and the reduction of inequalities
both within and between countries. The drivers and impacts of migration are
intimately linked to FAO’s global goals of eradicating hunger, food insecurity and
malnutrition, eliminating poverty and promoting the sustainable management
and utilization of natural resources.

139.	

In this context, the FMM project Productive investments to create decent rural
youth employment in migration-prone areas in Senegal68 was implemented
between December 2016 and May 2018 globally and piloted at the country level
in Senegal.

140.	

Senegal has traditionally been an important travel destination in the West Africa
region and has recently become a country of emigration and transit migration.
Therefore, the objective of the project was to promote investments in agriculture
and rural development in migration-prone areas, in order to address rural outmigration and harness the potential of migration for rural development.

141.	

The expected results of the project were as follows: (i) knowledge dissemination
and awareness-raising among key stakeholders about migration and rural
employment, as well as the linkages between migration, social protection and
rural development; (ii) support mechanisms for migrant economic initiatives
are identified and their capacities strengthened; (iii) increased policy coherence
across different areas, particularly among policies for agriculture and agro–

-----------------------Page 38 End-----------------------

industry, migration, employment, youth, rural finance and social protection;
(iv) a multisectoral and inclusive policy dialogue among all key stakeholders
in the migration sector, both public and private, is promoted; (v) a roadmap
is developed in consultation with key stakeholders; and (vi) a framework for
consultation among migration and rural development actors is promoted.
142.	

The results achieved in 2018 under three outputs of this project are synthetized
below. Under Output 1, FAO and the Senegalese National Statistics Agency
implemented a household survey to collect information on migration,
agriculture and rural livelihoods. The final data was delivered in January 2018.
Using the dataset, six studies were finalized in 2018. The first study titled
“Characteristics, dynamics and drivers of rural migration in Senegal” sheds light
on the characteristics, patterns and drivers of rural migration from the Kaolack
and Matam regions of Senegal (available at http://www.fao.org/3/CA0277EN/
ca0277en.pdf). This study helped to inform territorial youth employment and
rural development policies. The second study was titled “Assessment of the
labour absorption capacity of rural areas in sub-Saharan Africa: A Computable
General Equilibrium analysis for Senegal and Kenya”. Social Accounting Matrices
(SAMs) and Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) models were developed
to estimate the demand for and supply in rural labour markets as well as to
determine rural-to-urban migration trends in Kenya and Senegal.

143.	

The third study titled “Characteristics and Impacts of Migrant Remittances and
Skills Transfer” involved an analysis of the structure of remittances and their
impacts on households’ living conditions in rural areas. In addition, the study
analysed the contribution of migrants and diaspora on productive investment,
job creation and entrepreneurship in on- and off-farm activities. It also identified
good investment practices by migrants and a proposition of innovative financing
mechanisms to channel migrants’ remittances to more productive investments.
The fourth study entitled “Impact of public social protection programmes in
Senegal on the decision of beneficiary households to migrate” included an
analysis of the functioning of the Bourse de securité familiale, its impacts on
the livelihood of beneficiary households and its effects on their propensity to
migrate.

144.	

The fifth study titled “Male Out-migration and Women’s Work and Empowerment
in Agriculture: The Case of Nepal and Senegal” analysed the linkages between
migration and women’s work and empowerment in agriculture (for the full study,
please see https://bit.ly/3aK0t20). The study found that male out-migration
from rural, primary agricultural areas was strongly and significantly linked to
changes in women’s roles in agriculture in both countries. The sixth study titled
“Rural migrations in the dynamics of the Senegalese migration” extended and
developed the CIRAD–FAO Atlas “Rural Africa in motion. Dynamics and factors of
migrations south of the Sahara”, published in English in November 2017 (for the
full study, please see http://www.fao.org/3/i7951en/I7951EN.pdf) and released
in early April 2018 in its French version (please see https://bit.ly/2W5dbV1).

145.	

Under Output 2, two studies were completed in 2018. The first study titled
“Diagnosis of technical support schemes for migrant initiatives” identified all
technical support mechanisms for migrants in Senegal and provided a diagnosis
of their organization, performance and impact, with a view to proposing
recommendations that could improve their intervention. The second study titled

Flexible Multi-Partner Mechanism Annual Report 2018

22

-----------------------Page 39 End-----------------------

“Mapping of financial support mechanisms for businesses and migrant initiatives
and the valuation of remittances” identified all financial support mechanisms for
migrants in Senegal and provided a diagnosis of their performance and impact.
146.	

A capacity development workshop was also organized jointly with the Direction
Général des Sénégalais de l’Extérieure in April 2018 in the city of Thiès, Senegal.
This four-day technical workshop aimed at empowering the facilitators of the
Target Support Mechanisms for Migrant Initiatives, including enhancing their
knowledge on migration and rural development. The 30 participants and content
were selected based on the diagnostic study, which identified the support
structures, their activities and their needs for capacity building. Apart from
building capacity, the encounter between the different initiatives enabled them
to share experiences and good practices.

147.	

The final closing and validation workshop of the project was held on 26 April
2018 in Dakar, Senegal. The workshop brought together 100 stakeholders
actively involved in the field of migration. During the workshop, the analytical
results of project were shared and the key messages and recommendations of
the roadmap validated.

3.2.3.3. Women empowerment and social mobilization

23

Overview

148.	

Women make significant contributions to the rural economy in all regions
of the world. In developing countries, women make up about 40 percent of
the agricultural labour force, ranging from 20 percent in Latin America to 50
percent or more in certain parts of Africa and Asia (for more information,
please see http://www.fao.org/3/a-at890e.pdf). Women’s roles range from
being cultivators (as unpaid or paid workers), employers or employees to being
wage-labourers in on-farm or off-farm enterprises, alongside their key role as
providers of unpaid care work in their households and communities. However,
in many settings women face more constraints than men in accessing key
productive resources such as land and services such as credit, extension and
social protection. They also face wage discrimination in rural labour markets and
often work without remuneration on family farms. This limits their capacity to
contribute to agricultural production and take advantage of new opportunities.

149.	

The FMM project DIMITRA: Reduce rural poverty through information, participatory
communication and social mobilization for rural women, men and youth69 was
implemented between July 2014 and May 2018 with global, regional and
country-specific elements piloted in the Central African Republic, the Democratic
Republic of Congo, Mali, the Niger and Senegal.

150.	

The goal of this project was to improve rural people’s livelihoods and gender
equality, and to reduce rural poverty. Its specific objectives were to: (i) improve
access to information by rural populations; (ii) enhance their organizational
capacities so that they are able to participate in decision-making and take
ownership of their own development; and (iii) increase the use of gendersensitive participatory approaches such as the DIMITRA Clubs to contribute to
economic and social empowerment of rural populations, in particular women
and youth. The results achieved in 2018 under the different outputs of the
project are presented briefly below.

-----------------------Page 40 End-----------------------

151.	

Under Output 1, a number of documents were finalized in 2018. The first
draft of the Impact Study Report of the DIMITRA Clubs in terms of poverty
reduction and gender equality was completed. A Stocktaking Report of FAO
and external publications showcasing the DIMITRA Clubs approach were also
completed, covering a variety of thematic areas. Results of the stocktaking study
undertaken in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Niger and Senegal
were published in 2018. Key study areas included the functioning of the clubs,
concrete achievements and domains of impact. The study targeted 25 percent
of existing DIMITRA Clubs selected through randomization in the three countries
concerned.

152.	

The different sections on the DIMITRA Clubs in the FAO report titled ‘2017 Results,
Partnerships – Impact 2018’ were also finalized in 2018 (for the full report, please
see http://www.fao.org/3/i9057en/I9057EN.pdf). Talking points were further
developed on the DIMITRA Clubs in relation to ICT, gender and social cohesion.
A presentation of good practices, titled FAO DIMITRA Clubs, was also made.
The DIMITRA Clubs approach and its results were also presented at the seventh
Africa Day International Conference in May 2018 in Ljubljana, Slovenia
153.	

Under Output 2: Between January
and May 2018, the number of
DIMITRA Clubs increased from 1 900
to 2 500. It is estimated that this
dynamic process positively impacts
more than two million people. This
dramatic increase is directly related
to the decision made by country
and regional projects to use the
clubs as a gender empowerment
and community mobilization tool
in their projects. The new elements
that have evolved in 2018 include:
(i) gender-based violence has been
addressed in the majority of DIMITRA
Clubs, resulting in specific discussions
and actions; (ii) ICTs increasingly
emerge as a key driver to facilitate
communication and improve the
results; (iii) the use of the clubs is
growing in all kinds of projects with
community activities and collective
action (Box 2). Its use as a tool for
peace-building and social cohesion
has been highlighted as crucial in
post-conflict situations and refugee
camps. The DIMITRA Clubs helped
members’ voices to be heard (Box 3).

154.	

Under Output 3, more than 25
FAO country projects were using/
planning the DIMITRA Club approach
by May 2018 in several sub-Saharan

Success story from Dimitra Clubs
Collective action for erosion control
in Senegal
Erosion has intensified in recent years around
the village of Saré Boubou, Tambacounda,
Senegal, resulting in collapsed roads,
degraded fertile top soil and gullied
croplands. While the community would have
once contracted workers to undertake a
‘quick fix’, Dimitra Clubs identified the need
to address the problem in a more sustainable
way. They decided to reach out to the Institut
National de Pédologie (INP) to discuss
erosion control measures and a mediumto-long-term restoration project. Villagers
worked collectively and voluntarily under the
supervision and guidance of an INP expert
to build stone defences. These erosion
control measures have proven successful,
demonstrating the support that the Dimitra
Clubs approach can give communities,
with a focus on women’s voices and their
participation, with regard to taking collective
decisions and action.

Impact of Dimitra Clubs: an example from the Niger
A study was carried out in the Niger to understand the impact of the Dimitra Clubs approach
using a sample of villages chosen from Tillabery, Maradi and Zinder regions. The findings show
that the Dimitra Clubs helped in the following areas:
•	 Created an enabling environment for women’s voices to be heard: The clubs allowed
a social space for women not just to gather and discuss but also to elaborate questions,
posit issues publicly, ask for collective solutions and for proposing alternatives to the whole
community to the current unsatisfying situations.
•	 Exercise of participation and collective decision-making: The participatory process
constitutes an effective medium for public opinions to be created, heard and valued in
decision-making.
•	 Changed attitudes and reduction in harmful practices: Different age groups of both
female and male club members claim that the initiative led to changes in key behaviors that
contribute to the reproduction of gender-inequality patterns. Notably, early marriage and
forced marriage are now considered detrimental to girls’ development. Domestic violence
is morally sanctioned and claimed to be significantly reduced, while a culture of reciprocal
respect between spouses is being fostered.
•	 Developed mechanisms for increasing economic resilience and food security: The
experience of savings groups co-evolved with Dimitra Clubs and is now providing a
mechanism for individuals, households and community resilience, while also fostering social
cohesion. Collective action in agriculture is leading participating women to additional income
and men to better management of resources.
•	 Construction of infrastructures for agriculture and services: The Clubs represent a
responsive mechanism capable of quick self-organization and collective action. Some
management interventions are found to be agreed upon and built by the clubs. Basic services
such as education and health are improved by the clubs’ will and availability to construct
housing facilities for teachers or health agents.
•	 Proactive attitude towards local institutions. The Clubs have developed significant
connections with local institutions at village as well at municipal level. Municipal institutions
know the existence of the Dimitra Clubs, consult them often, and take issues and requests
raised by the clubs into consideration during territorial planning.
countries, working on different technical areas, sometimes in partnership
with other UN agencies. Partnership within FAO is increasing, starting from
the countries where the DIMITRA Clubs approach has been implemented
and outstanding results obtained. There was a 40-percent increase of new
partnerships at country-level between June 2017 and May 2018. This increase
translated into an additional 1 000 new DIMITRA Clubs by January 2018.

Voices from the field
Becoming a community leader: the story of Bineta Diao
“I am 27 years old and a mother of four children – three girls and a boy. Married at the age of
fifteen, I left my village in 2005 to live in my marital home in Sinthiou Elhadji (Senegal). I was in
my last year of primary school when my older sister died, leaving a new-born baby. My mother
had herself just given birth and could not take care of two babies on her own at the same time.
It was then that my family decided to end my schooling, so that I could look after my sister’s
child. I never had the chance to return to my studies.
When I moved to the marital home in Sinthiou Elhadji in 2005, I immediately joined the
village women’s group, so as to take part in their activities and help me settle in to this new
environment. For twelve years, I remained a simple group member, quiet and extremely shy,
no doubt due to my previous experiences. Evaluation meetings held for the women’s group’s
tontine did nothing to change my character or to help me overcome my shyness.
In January 2017, the Dimitra Clubs were launched in my village and, very reluctantly, I found
myself being chosen as leader of the women’s club. I was seized by panic at the very thought
of letting down the people who had appointed me to represent them. It was thanks to training
and to taking the floor during village assemblies and other club meetings that I gradually
managed to overcome my stage fright and speak in public with a calm, clear voice. These days
I am able to express my ideas in public without fear and with a great deal of confidence and
self-control, whether or not the audience is made up exclusively of women, or whether men
are also present, as is sometimes the case.
My greatest source of pride is the way that the villagers, and especially the women, consult
me on a regular basis, seeking my advice on issues that concern them and put me in the
foreground when a community decision needs to be taken. The esteem and trust shown
towards me by both men and women mean that my standing has now risen considerably
within the village. And that has brought out leadership qualities in me that I never dreamed
I will have. With all that I have been through in my life, this development of my personality
comes as a reward and a great comfort, which I owe to the Dimitra Clubs.”
of the project, FAO decided to pursue the activities under an FMM bridging
project (FMM/GLO/122/MUL) to ensure international support for advocacy,
supervision, coordination, training, quality control, knowledge management and
methodological support in the area of work of the DIMITRA project.
156.	

The bridging phase will enable FAO to maintain core capacities in the DRE and
DIMITRA teams in the Social Policies and Rural Institutions Division to coordinate
these work streams until new funding is confirmed. It will also be instrumental to
support ongoing resource mobilization efforts and mainstream the approaches
in the programmes to be developed under the new FMM facility.

Overview

Forest and farm producers often plant
trees to diversify saleable products such
as fruits, nuts, spices, gums and resins,
dyes, medicines, timber and fuel-wood.
This diversity gives them resilience to
fluctuations in prices, because there will
always be market gluts or shortfalls that
bring risk to those selling only one product.
This diversity also increases resilience to
climate change, as varied trees not only
improve soil and water conservation but
also act as alternative source of income
or food when other annual crops fail (e.g.
fruit trees, and other products for cash).
Increased tree planting also acts as carbon
sink by reducing atmospheric carbon
dioxide and storing in its biomass.

158.	

The Forest and Farm Facility (FFF) is part of
an umbrella multi-donor funded project70,
with the other projects, including the
Carlowitz Project71 and the FMM project
Strengthening Forest and Farm Producer
Organizations (FFPOs) through Forest and
Farm Facility72. The FMM project is a
partnership between FAO, the International
Institute for Environment and Development,
IUCN and AgriCord, and it was implemented
in Plurinational State of Bolivia, Guatemala,
Kenya, Myanmar, Viet Nam and Zambia.
This project aims to strengthen smallholder,
women, community and indigenous
peoples’ producer organizations towards
livelihoods and policy engagement. It helps
poor rural people enhance their business
skills, build their own enterprises, increase
access to markets, services, knowledge
and technologies and improve access to,
control over and sustainable management
of natural resources. In addition, it aims to
empower the rural poor and strengthen
producers’ organizations, to enable them to
decision-making processes that affect their livelihoods.

All major activities supported by the FMM project were completed by December
2017. The no-cost extension to May 2018 provided an opportunity to consolidate
and share the results of the FFF Phase I and help to promote key elements from
the lessons learned for scaling up.

-----------------------Page 44 End-----------------------

160.	

The travel funding provided by FMM enabled team members to participate in
a final workshop in February 2018 in the Market Analyses and Development
training cycle that had earlier been supported in Plurinational State of Bolivia,
leading to several enterprise development plans for forest and farm producer
organizations (FFPOs). Support was provided by FMM for travel for participation
of FFF team members in a series of international meetings to highlight lessonlearning and share the impacts from FFF Phase I and the FMM funding.

countries (for more information, please see http://www.fao.org/3/b-i7231e.
pdf). The project will also deliver technical support and knowledge exchange in a
wider network of countries.

162.	

Phase II sharpens its focus on gender equality, youth engagement and FFPO
value chains that reduce poverty at the core of climate-resilient landscapes.
The intention of FFF Phase II is to mainstream FFPO engagement in climate
responses, linking them to NDCs and large-scale landscape restoration and
territorial development efforts. In addition, it will scale up FFPO contributions
to landscape-scale mitigation, adaptation and resilience to address climate
change (SDGs 13, 15 and 16), food security (SDG 2) and nutrition and poverty
reduction (SDG 3), and gender equality (SDG 5), as well as contribute to a wide
set of additional SDGs. At the time of writing this report, USD 19.5 million had
been secured and work is beginning in nine core countries and seven network
countries.

3.2.3.5. Social protection
163.	

Social protection is a set of interventions, the objective of which is to reduce
social and economic risk and vulnerability, and to alleviate extreme poverty
and deprivation. Social protection includes three types of programmes73:
(i) social assistance: publically provided conditional or unconditional cash
or in-kind transfers, or public works programmes; (ii) social insurance:
contributory programmes that cover designated contingencies affecting the
welfare or income of households; and (iii) labour market protection providing
unemployment benefits, building skills and training workers. Social protection is
a key aspect in a strategy for rural poverty reduction.

164.	

FAO provides countries with evidence-based policy support to design inclusive
nutrition-sensitive, risk-informed social protection programmes. In this
regard, the FMM project “Expansion of social protection coverage to the rural
poor”74 was implemented between January 2017 and May 2018 in Lebanon,
Lesotho, Mali and Zambia. The project was aimed at generating evidence to
support participating countries as they progress towards reaching SDG 1.3
in three specific areas of work: (i) identifying the key barriers to access social
protection in rural areas, and propose costed options for expansion, and (ii)
generating solid evidence to build an economic case for expansion including
on the economic impact of social protection, and (iii) “Social Protection PLUS”
programmes aimed at boosting the livelihoods and productive capacities of poor
and vulnerable households, while improving their nutritional status.

Overview

165.	

	In 2018, the project was able to support the development of knowledge and
assess innovative approaches to contribute to building a strong economic case
to expand social protection to rural areas across the four countries. In Lebanon,
the FMM supported the creation and implementation of a pilot farmer registry in
collaboration with the Ministry of Agriculture. In addition, the project organized
a workshop in February 2018 under the patronage of the Ministry to present
the results of the 2017 pilot, the legal and institutional proposal for the register
establishment, including the definition of farmers/fishers, and their inclusion
in the National Social Security Fund. A total of 57 participants from relevant
ministries and UN organizations attended and contributed to the discussions.
This activity paved the way for the organization of a high-level workshop to occur
during 2019 in partnership with ILO and decision-makers of line ministries on
the expansion of Social Protection to rural areas.

166.	

In Lesotho, the FMM complemented the ongoing evaluation of the Child Grants
Programme (CGP) and the Sustainable Poverty Reduction through Income,
Nutrition and Access to Government Services (SPRINGS) programme, with
additional data collection focused on anthropometric indicators and qualitative
analysis (for more information on this programme, please see https://unc.
live/3aHAlEV). The integrated approach of CGP and SPRINGS was an innovative
intervention, led by FAO in partnership with UNICEF and the Government of
Lesotho. In September 2018, a workshop was organized by FAO to present
the results of the study in Maseru, and a total of 50 participants from relevant
ministries and UN organizations attended and contributed to the event.

167.	

167.	 In Mali, FMM advocated for greater linkages of social protection with
resilience and productive interventions. The activities were tailored to specific
requests from the Ministry of Solidarity and Humanitarian Action to provide
options for the expansion of social protection coverage to rural populations
combined with productive support. The initiative is part of the support to
the National Plan of Expansion of Social Protection. In collaboration with the
Commissariat Securité Alimentaire and WFP, a study was conducted on improving
coordination between existing safety nets and crises response. To complete the
study, a two-day workshop was held in Bamako in May 2018 with the attendance
of 26 participants. The FMM also supported an evaluation of a Cash+ programme
in Mali and Mauritania led by the FAO Emergency Office for West Africa,
which aimed to provide information for designing similar programmes and
strengthening the livelihoods of chronically poor households or those affected
by one-off or recurrent shocks (for more information on this programme, please
see https://bit.ly/39Ep73X).

168.	

In Zambia, key activities undertaken in the country on social protection have
allowed FAO to be recognized as a critical actor in the national social protection
sector and among development partners. FAO has since been formally included
as one of the members of a United Nations Joint Programme (UNJP) on social
protection were it is leading the support to the Livelihoods and Empowerment
pillar of the programme. Through the FMM and as part of the joint programme,
FAO supported a qualitative assessment of the national Food Security Pack
programme in 2018. The results of this assessment are being used as a basis for
developing a pilot project and some of the findings have been incorporated in
the draft revised Food Security Pack programme, policies and procedures.

-----------------------Page 46 End-----------------------

169.	

In addition, FAO finalized a Livelihoods Profiling study jointly with Indaba
Agricultural Policy Research Institute to inform the roll-out of social protection
and agricultural programmes based on the varying livelihoods profiles and
characteristics of farmers (for more information on this study, please see
https://bit.ly/3cKY8FX). The FMM supported the Impact Evaluation of the
Home Grown School Feeding programme and market access programmes
and the results were shared and validated through a national stakeholder
workshop organized by FAO in June 2018 (for the full evaluation study, please
see http://www.fao.org/3/CA2800EN/ca2800en.pdf). Consequently, a follow up
qualitative study was planned to answer some of the questions generated by the
quantitative study.

3.2.3.6. Digital inclusion
170.	

The 2030 Agenda recognizes information and communication technologies
(ICTs) as catalysts for accelerating human progress, equality and sustainable
development. In this context, FAO is convinced that increased attention is
needed to reducing the gender gap across all areas of its work, including ICTs.
FAO and its partners are involved in the development and implementation of
digital inclusion initiatives and the scaling up of innovative digital services. In
that regard, the FMM project “Agricultural Services and Digital Inclusion in Africa”75
was implemented in 2017–2018 in Rwanda and Senegal. This project is part of a
broader initiative that leverages the knowledge of FAO and its strategic partners
in the mobile world, promoting digital inclusion for smallholders and family
farmers. A particular emphasis was put on the needs of young, self-employed
entrepreneurs, female-headed households, breaking down the barriers for
access and use of information through digital technologies. The objective of
this project was to provide the rural poor better and more equitable access to
information, productive resources, services and markets.

171.	

Four Digital Value Added Services (DVAS), namely Weather and Crop Calendar,
Cure and Feed Your Livestock, AgriMarketplace and E-Nutrifood were developed
for smallholders and family farmers in Rwanda and Senegal through mobile
applications.76 The Weather and Crop Calendar combines information on
weather forecasts and crop calendars. The Cure and Feed Your Livestock
provides real-time information on animal disease control and animal feeding
best practices. The AgriMarketplace connects producers and traders to facilitate
trade and access to price information. The E-Nutrifood provides information
on production, conservation and consumption of nutritious foods. The services
were designed with the users through the Human Centred Design Approach.

172.	

The FMM project is working with local software developers in close collaboration
with the government focal points, focal points of strategic partners in the
regions, local leaders and associations besides the extension agents. In Rwanda,
teachers and students from the Tumba Technology College are following and
participating in the project as local accelerators and incubators.

173.	

From a gender perspective, the project aims at increasing the access of women
to relevant, reliable, timely and actionable information to take better decisions
about their lives, the management of their assets and their families. In the pilot
phase, the test groups were constructed guaranteeing that 50 percent of the test
users would be female.

Flexible Multi-Partner Mechanism Annual Report 2018

-----------------------Page 47 End-----------------------

174.	

The project ensured integration of the Progressive Web App, Text/SMS
(RapidPro) and Web Services (APIs) linked to existing FAO data products like the
FAO Global Information and Early Warning System (GIEWS)77 price tool, the FAO
Earth Observation78 and the FAO Water Productivity Portal.79 All data services of
the apps are published and stored as open APIs.

175.	

Sustainability is one of the aspects that this project has strongly promoted.
For this, a series of actions, commitments and identification of value for small
farmers, as well as for different organizations has been discussed, negotiated
and accepted. This is one of the important characteristics in terms of the
business model that has been developed in this project.

Lessons learned
176.	

One of the useful lessons learned is the importance of getting youth
beneficiaries on board at the beginning, as partners, champions and service
providers. The innovation potential of direct engagement of the youth is
huge, not only to ensure results sustainability, but also to push forward the
modernization of communication strategies and approaches and tools, with
potential extended benefits for the broader FAO work programme. Another
important lesson is FAO’s comparative advantage at country level in the
facilitation of a more programmatic approach for youth-inclusive food systems.
While the topic has become a high priority issue, especially in sub-Saharan
Africa, and many interventions are flourishing, coordination remains an issue
that hinders the achieving of scale and lasting impact.

177.	

Following the good lessons learnt, the DIMITRA Clubs is fully integrated in FAO’s
Community Resilience Strategy, its Caisses de resilience approach and increasingly
as a support to the Farmers Field Schools (FFS) approach.

178.	

Another key lesson learnt from the projects implemented under SO3 is the
supplementary support from FFM to ongoing programmes to ensure successful
completion. For example, the FMM funding has been instrumental in taking
the first Phase of the forest and farm facility programme to a successful
conclusion. The FMM funds were critical to show the proof-of-concept of this
pilot phase was vital and an important acknowledgement of the work as a
priority, especially under SP3 Output 3.1.1. The work was made more effective
by the close collaboration and support across the organizations, especially with
the South–South Cooperation Division (DPS) teams on strengthening producer
organization and cooperatives, the Indigenous Peoples Liaison Office, and the
Communications for Development and SP3 management teams.

Challenges
179.	

31

Overview

Some challenges were encountered in the implementation of social protection
programmes. For example in Lebanon, the integration of social protection
considerations into the agriculture sector by itself and building linkages with
external partners was challenging, and this delayed the design phase. In Zambia,
adverse weather conditions and low farmer attendance delayed the data
collection. Accessing auxiliary information for evidence generation purposes has
also been a challenge.

-----------------------Page 48 End-----------------------

180.	

With regard to Digital Inclusion, the limited experience of FAO’s Information
Technology Division (CIO) and the core working group, the complexity of the
digital translation of contents in a pedagogical format for easy understanding
by the main client was a key challenge. Another such challenge was the
commitment and involvement of local institutions, and the limited participation
of the focal points designated by each ministry. Lack of data and information
was yet another challenge, as assumed at the inception of the project. Making
these data from teams and national partners available for direct use by farmers
as digital services was a considerable challenge.

3.2.4. Enabling inclusive and efficient agri–food systems (SO4)
181.	

The ten FMM projects implemented by SO4 in 2018 fall under the following
broad areas: (1) Investment in Agribusiness; (2) Food Loss and Waste; (3)
Sustainable Food Systems; (4) Value Chain Development; and (5) Capacity
Development in Trade and AMR.

3.2.4.1. Investment in agribusiness and agro–industry
182.	

Small-scale producers provide over 70 percent of the world’s food needs while
agribusinesses are important generators of employment and income worldwide.
The agribusiness sector, which comprises the business activities performed from
farm to fork, is a major generator of employment and income worldwide. The
importance of the agribusiness sector has grown significantly as agricultural
development strategies shifted from a pure production-oriented approach to
a broader systems perspective that emphasizes agri–food chain coordination,
value creation and the institutional setting under which such chains operate.
Seen as an engine for growth, agribusiness and its related industries are
receiving increased attention in policies and strategies that aim to promote
investments in agro–enterprises and agro-based value chain development.

183.	

In 2018, the FMM project “Agribusinesses and agri–food chains that are more
inclusive and efficient are developed and implemented by the public and private
sectors”80 was implemented. This project aimed to (i) increase awareness on the
causes, impact and approaches to reduce food losses; (ii) enhance collaboration
and synergy of initiatives on food loss and waste (FLW) reduction; and (iii)
increase adoption of good practices to reduce food losses in specific value
chains. The project continues to do so by providing a platform for centralizing
and sharing information through the Save Food website81 and associated
products, developing analysis, creating necessary coordination mechanisms and
supporting capacity building on FLW Reduction.

184.	

In 2018, the project completed installation of electricity to operationalize
three tomato processing units in Tigray, Ethiopia. The last training in the use
of equipment, good manufacturing practices and hygiene was also delivered
by the French Network of Food Technology Institutes (ACTIA) experts to
the women associations involved in tomato processing in Ethiopia (Box 4).
In Ghana, the FAO-Thiaroye fish processing technology (FTT-Thiaroye) was
installed in Dzemeni.82 In Côte d’Ivoire, the Institut européen de coopération et
de développement (IECD) coaching and capacity development activities were
completed (Box 5). The e-learning training package on gender-sensitive value
chains was developed together with UNITAR and has been available online

Flexible Multi-Partner Mechanism Annual Report 2018

32

-----------------------Page 49 End-----------------------

since March 2018.83 The ‘Developing gender-sensitive value chains – Guidelines for
practitioners’ was also published in hard copy (for the full guidelines, please see
http://www.fao.org/3/I9212EN/i9212en.pdf).
3.2.4.2. Food loss and waste
185.	

Food waste is part of food loss and refers to the discarding or alternative
(non-food) use of food that is safe and nutritious for human consumption
along the entire food supply chain (for more information, please see http://
www.fao.org/3/a-i7657e.pdf). Food loss takes place between production
and distribution, while food waste takes place mainly at the consumer level,
in the retail and food service sectors. Food losses and waste represent a
serious depletion of technical, financial and natural resources invested in land
preparation, production, harvesting, handling, processing and packaging of food.
Measures for reducing food loss and waste must, therefore, be environmentally
sustainable while contributing to the efficiency and sustainability of food supply
chains and fostering food and nutrition security.

186.	

Through its Global Initiative on Food Loss and Waste Reduction,84 FAO promotes
a holistic and multidisciplinary approach to addressing FLW reduction. This
approach prioritizes the food-use-not-waste-hierarchy, which gives precedence
to reduction at source, followed by recovery and redistribution, and uses
components such as animal feed and compost or energy recovery in the last
stages of disposal.

187.	

The FMM project “Global Initiative on Food Loss and Waste Reduction”85 was
implemented between 2016 and 2018 in Cameroon, Colombia, the Dominican
Republic, Egypt, Jamaica, the Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Morocco,
Myanmar, Zambia and Zimbabwe to support activities and projects under the
umbrella of Save Food.

188.	

In 2018, the project held a training workshop on food loss assessment in Kenya,
and developed indicators and M&E framework for FLW. This was aimed at
assisting the country in developing policies and strategies for food loss and
waste reduction. In Zambia and Zimbabwe, residual activities on food loss
assessment were conducted, contributing to the evidence on which to base the
formulation of policies and strategies.

189.	

A regional training of trainers (ToT) on food loss assessment was conducted in
Cameroon with participants from Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Côte d’Ivoire and the
Democratic Republic of the Congo, building capacity in these countries for food
loss assessment.

3.2.4.3. Sustainable food systems
190.	

33

Overview

A sustainable food system (SFS) is a food system that delivers food security
and nutrition for all in such a way that the economic, social and environmental
bases to generate food security and nutrition for future generations are not
compromised (for more information, please see http://www.fao.org/3/
ca2079en/CA2079EN.pdf). In order to be sustainable, the development of
the food system needs to generate positive value along three dimensions
simultaneously: economic, social and environmental (Figure 2).

A success story from Ethiopia
(FMM/GLO/103/MUL)
In Ethiopia, the project focuses on supporting
women associations and cooperatives already
engaged in the production and marketing of fruits
and horticulture products in the Tigray region. The
tomato value chain was selected as one of the most
promising ones in view of the significant engagement
of women, the potential local market demand for
semi-processed and processed products – taking
into consideration the dietary patterns – as well as
the positive impact on.
Five women associations established under the
©FAO
umbrella of an Irrigation Scheme Association were
initially identified for FMM support and three were then selected for being engaged in tomato processing.
These were ‘Tekien and Askual’ association, ‘Tadalech and Roman’ association and ‘Almaz and Zenebu’
association, with a total of 100 members. FAO’s role was to facilitate partnership and collaboration between
public institutions and a service provider called Women in Self Employment, the establishment of the three
processing units, facilitating access to equipment, and capacity building for women associations and
service providers in several areas.

Innovative fish smoking transforms women’s lives in Côte d’Ivoire
Smoked fish is a vital source of food, nutrition and income for many African coastal communities. In Côte
d’Ivoire, smoked fish is hugely popular and widely sold in markets. However, the traditional smoking
method requires large amounts of wood, letting off choking clouds of smoke. Research showed that over
60 percent of the women who smoked fish had suffered symptoms including respiratory and eye problems.
Their children also suffered health consequences, as they were often present as the women worked, either
bundled up on their backs or playing by their sides. The women often have no other options for better
working conditions. “If you have kids, and you don’t do this, how will you feed them or send them to
school?” “This is hell.” said Tia Florence, a fish smoker in Guessabo.
Working in four pilot communities, the FMM project developed a user-friendly and clean technology,
known as Thiaroye fish processing technology (FTT-Thiaroye) oven for use by women’s cooperatives. For
each kilo of smoked fish produced, the ovens use only 0.8 kg of wood instead of 5 kg with the traditional
smoking method. “Here, once you put your fish in the oven, you can rest until the fish is cooked and then
you can go sell it in the market,” explained Blé Odile, who started smoking fish at the pilot site in Guessabo.
The improved quality and taste of the fish brought in higher selling prices, increasing the women’s income.
It also allowed them to save and get bank IDs, and pay school fees for their children. Many of the women
in the pilot area also used the extra time for literacy and mathematics classes, which allowed them to
better calculate their profits. “We are organized women aware of our impact on the national economy,” said
Micheline Dion, President of the Cooperative for Fishery Products, Traders and Processors in Abobodoume,
Abidjan. “Thanks to the scale of our activities, we contribute to job creation and food security at the national
level.”

-----------------------Page 51 End-----------------------

191.	

From December 2016 to May 2018, FAO implemented the FMM project
“Developing Sustainable Food Systems for Urban Areas (also called NADHALI)86 in
Bangladesh, Kenya and Peru, aiming at building the foundation for supporting
local decision makers in food-systems planning for cities. The NADHALI project
(named after its pilot cities, Nairobi, Dhaka and Lima) aimed to support
local governments in their work to achieve sustainable food systems in their
municipalities.

192.	

In 2018, the project completed the development of the Rapid Urban Food
Systems Appraisal Tool (RUFSAT) and tested it in Nairobi, Dhaka and
Lima. Spatial analysis was added as part of the RUFSAT in two of the three
countries.87 The project also established the food systems Multi-Stakeholders
Platform (MSP) in all three countries to support the RUFSAT methodology with
qualitative information. The MSPs have been created with the leadership of
the municipalities in the case of Nairobi and Lima, and of the Ministry of Local
Government in the case of Dhaka.

193.	

Workshops involving various food systems stakeholders (producers association,
retail market representatives, private sector and non-governmental
organizations) involved in food-related issues have been organized to develop
a common vision for the food systems strategy. Awareness-raising workshops
were organized on food-systems planning including RUFSAT, the establishment
of the Food Systems MSP and the prioritization of actions. A training course was
also organized at the World Urban Forum with participation of stakeholders
from Dhaka.

194.	

The Food Charter in Lima was developed and signed by the MSP members
(for the full document, please see http://www.fao.org/3/BU650es/bu650es.
pdf). The Development of the Food Systems Strategy has started in Lima and
Nairobi. As at the end of 2018, a complete draft of the document was developed
in Nairobi with support of FAO. The FAO publication titled “Sustainable
Food Systems: Concept and Framework” was completed in 2018 (for the full
publication, please see http://www.fao.org/3/ca2079en/CA2079EN.pdf).

3.2.4.4. Value chain development

35

Overview

195.	

Agricultural markets are rapidly globalizing, generating new consumption
patterns and new production and distribution systems. Agricultural value chains
grow and become more sophisticated as countries industrialize and strengthen
their position in global markets. Traditional agricultural value chains are
generally governed through spot market transactions involving a large number
of small retailers and producers. On the other hand, modern value chains are
characterized by vertical coordination, consolidation of the supply base, agro–
industrial processing and use of standards throughout the chain. Modern value
chains, often controlled by multinational or national firms and supermarkets, are
capturing a growing share of the agri–food systems in developing regions.

196.	

FAO takes a holistic approach to enhancing the development of inclusive crop
and livestock value chains. In that regard, two FMM projects were implemented
in 2017. These were “Linking SDGs 1 and 2 through pro-poor inclusive value chain
development in the context of SIDS”88 and “Value chain development in support of
sustainable intensification in Africa”89.

-----------------------Page 52 End-----------------------

197.	

From November 2016 to May 2018, the FMM project “Linking SDGs 1 and 2
through pro-poor inclusive value chain development in the context of SIDS” was
implemented in Cook Islands, Fiji, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga and Vanuatu.
The project aimed to establish an enabling environment for the development
of pro-poor inclusive food systems in Pacific Small Island and Developing States
(SIDS) through knowledge and evidence generation and dissemination, and
capacity development for inclusive and efficient nutrition-sensitive value chains.

198.	

Nationals from ten Pacific island nations were made aware of the World
Programme for the Census of Agriculture 202090 for the implementation of
their agricultural censuses in the 2016–2025 period and four countries have
already indicated their commitment to carrying out the Census in the next two
years; preparatory work is presently under way with technical support from
FAO. Another workshop on Planning and Conduct of Agricultural Census in
partnership with the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) of the United
States Department of Agriculture (USDA) was organized in March 2018 in Fiji
to build the capacity of three countries – Fiji, Papua New Guinea and Samoa.
Experiences were shared, leading to a discussion on a standardized agricultural
census for Pacific island nations.

199.	

The capacities of the National Statistics Offices (NSOs) of Solomon Islands and
Tonga were developed to monitor SDG Target 2.1 and report on the SDGs by
2019 through the Voluntary National Review, as well as address needs to align
the national development goals to SDGs.

200.	

The first estimate of SDG 2.1.1 Prevalence of undernourishment (PoU) for
Tonga and the first for the region based on food data collected from national
survey was obtained. After the presentation on the Food Insecurity Experience
Scale (FIES), the Tongan NSO immediately decided to include the module in the
forthcoming national labour force survey.

201.	

The 27th session of the Asia and Pacific Commission on Agricultural Statistics
(APCAS 27) was organized in March 2018 in Fiji.91 The FMM provided support
to the 11 participants to attend the session. The main topics discussed were
monitoring SDGs, the Strategy to Improve Agricultural and Rural Statistics,
Developing an Integrated System of Agricultural Census and Surveys, Status of
Agricultural Statistics in the Pacific Island States. This session also launched the
Pacific Strategic Plan for Agricultural and Fisheries Statistics (P-SPAFS), which
was co-developed by FAO and the Pacific Community (SPC), with a focus on the
specific issues faced by Small Island Developing States (SIDS) (for the full plan,
please see http://www.fao.org/3/I8344EN/i8344en.pdf).

202.	

A section on “Pacific Food Systems and Fisheries” was developed for the 2018
FAO State of World Fisheries and Aquaculture (for the entire publication, please
see http://www.fao.org/3/I9540EN/i9540en.pdf). A set of journal articles on
food systems of the Pacific were published.

203.	

Capacities of government staff from the Ministry of Agriculture and the Scientific
Research Organization of Samoa (SROS) trough study tours to Fiji and New
Zealand were built for best practices in breadfruit production, harvesting and
value addition and scoping out potential outlets for breadfruit products from
Samoa. Skills of selected farmers and women groups were enhanced in Samoa

Flexible Multi-Partner Mechanism Annual Report 2018

36

-----------------------Page 53 End-----------------------

through training on post-harvest losses management, value addition and
marketing techniques for breadfruit. A breadfruit commercialization feasibility
study was produced for the Samoan Government, which identified opportunities
and weaknesses in various value chains and made recommendations for both
public and private investment.

37

Overview

204.	

Case Studies on the contribution of nearshore fish aggregating devices (FADs)
to food security in Marshall Islands and Samoa were completed together
with associated socio-economic surveys. Communications materials were
produced from the surveys, which included posters to communicate results to
communities. A report was produced on key constraints and opportunities in the
value chain for small-scale tuna fisheries based on a regional expert meeting.
Case studies were also developed and capacities built in Fiji, Samoa, Solomon
Islands, Tonga and Vanuatu on contract farming opportunities and instruments.
The Government of Tonga agreed to develop a Contract Farming bill. Extension
officers in Vanuatu agreed to work as mediators and persons of capacity for
Contract Farming agreements. Private-sector actors in Fiji expressed interest in
signing contracts with potential farmers.

205.	

The project supported participation of Pacific SIDS representatives to attend a
side event on the ‘Regional Framework for Accelerating Action on Food Security and
Nutrition in Pacific SIDS’ as the Pacific regional implementation framework for
the Global Action Programme on Food and Nutrition Security in SIDS in October
2017 in Port Vila, Vanuatu, as part of the wider Pacific Week of Agriculture Event.

206.	

The project also supported a study tour and mini “talkshop” for small-scale tuna
fishers to share experiences and explore opportunities for improving profitability
of fishing operations including: (i) FAD design, operation and maintenance; (ii)
performance of cooperatives; (iii) small scale fisheries management issues; (iv)
best practices for fisheries management, (v) policy and sector development,
(vi) investment in cooperatives for job creation and economic growth and (vii)
“leading and championing sector growth”. This peer-to-peer exchange of FAD
fishers in the Pacific and Caribbean produced new partnerships and the basis for
a regional FAD fisher project.

207.	

A video “Voices from the Pacific” featuring the small-scale fleet fisheries sector
was produced to emphasize the importance of community engagement (Box 6).
The film was promoted in international and regional conferences and events.

208.	

The FMM project “Value chain development in support of sustainable intensification
in Africa”92 was implemented in Benin, Cameroon, Chad, Côte d’Ivoire, the
Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ghana, Kenya, Mali, Mozambique, Rwanda
and Zambia in 2017. The objectives of the project were to: (i) strengthen capacity
of the small-and-medium-scale agro–enterprise sector to add value to and
commercialize smallholder production; (ii) increase opportunities for income
generation, employment and transfer of technologies and business skills; and
(iii) strengthen capacities of ministries of agriculture and trade and industry to
align their sectoral policies and improve the enabling environment for trade and
agribusiness development.

209.	

A total of 39 extension officers and lead farmers from 11 countries attended
a three-week practical training programme at the Songhai Centre in Benin

-----------------------Page 54 End-----------------------

in March 2018, with a view toward building their capacities in integrated
agricultural systems.
210.	

An assessment was conducted on the impact of FAO-funded training courses
offered by Songhai from 2016 to 2018 in order to identify ways to render the
trainings more effective and cost-efficient.

211.	

A mentorship programme for small and medium agricultural enterprises was
conducted following the agribusiness training courses implemented in 2017.
The 50 SMAEs underwent a mentorship programme implemented in partnership
with the African Agribusiness Incubator Network.

212.	

In response to the request from the African Union Commission (AUC) for FAO to
support the development of a framework to guide African governments on the
design, implementation and monitoring of public–private partnerships (PPPs)
in the agricultural sector, appraisals of PPPs were completed in Côte d’Ivoire,
Ghana, South Africa and Zambia, and a regional workshop was held to validate
the findings and agree on next steps.
3.2.4.5. Capacity development in trade

Box 6.

213.	

Through FMM projects, FAO ramped
up efforts to strengthen capacity of
governments to design policies and
programmes to facilitate trade. The
following four FMM projects were
implemented under the broad area
of Capacity Development in Trade: (1)
“Trade related capacity development
in Eastern and Southern Africa”93; (2)
“Trade Related Capacity Development
in Eastern Europe and Central Asia”94;
(3) “Support to the development of
National Action Plans on Antimicrobial
Resistance (AMR) in Latin America and
the Caribbean”95; and (4) “Strengthening
capacities, policies and national action
plans on aquatic AMR”96

214.	

The FMM project “Trade related
capacity development in Eastern and
Southern Africa” was implemented in
Mozambique, the United Republic of
Tanzania and Zambia in 2017. The
overall objectives of the project were
(i) to increase capacity of the East and
Southern African Region to effectively
design sub-regional and national
strategies that provide adequate
solutions to trade related issues;
and (ii) to support Mozambique,
the United Republic of Tanzania

Voices from The Pacific
Over half of the Pacific Island population rely
on coastal fisheries as the main source of
food and income. However, the people of the
Pacific face increasing threats to their marine
resources due to growing populations,
overfishing, pollution, and climate change.
With the support of fisheries agencies,
community-based fisheries management
efforts in Fiji, Samoa and Tonga empowers
these coastal fishing communities to take
control of marine resources that ensure
their food security and livelihoods. And
importantly, it protects the environment as
well as preserves the social, cultural and
traditions of Pacific Islanders.
A video supported by the Flexible MultiPartner
Mechanism
was
produced
documenting the voices of fishing
communities and stakeholders in Fiji, Samoa
and Tonga. Two versions of the film can be
viewed by clicking on the following link:

and Zambia for evidence-based policy-making, and enhanced cross-sectoral
coordination in the design and implementation of agricultural trade policies,
strategies and agreements.

Overview

215.	

The project facilitated two e-Learning courses in 2017 for participants from
Eastern and Southern African countries. The project also organized one regional
dialogue for 18 participants combining the e-Learning with face-to-face training.
Following up on these activities, a second regional dialogue was held in 29
January 2018.

216.	

In 2017, four studies were conducted on the coherence of agricultural and trade
policies in Mozambique, the United Republic of Tanzania, Zambia and Zanzibar
(United Republic of Tanzania) and national dialogues were held to validate these
reports with the participation of stakeholders from the government, the private
sector, academic institutions, and donors from both trade and agriculture.
During these dialogues, priority areas were identified for the preparation of
project proposals and concept notes in Mozambique, the United Republic of
Tanzania and Zambia. In 2018, the project proposals were completed and
were presented to the national stakeholders both in bilateral meetings and in
dialogue events. Dedicated meetings were held for government stakeholders in
Zambia in March 2018, and in Mozambique and the United Republic of Tanzania
in April 2018, and the project proposals were validated.

217.	

The project “Trade Related Capacity Development in Eastern Europe and Central
Asia” was implemented in Georgia, Kyrgyzstan and Ukraine between February
2017 and May 2018. The project aimed to strengthen the enabling environment
for the implementation of multilateral trade agreements and to support export
development in line with the FAO Regional Initiative for Improving Agri–Food
Trade and Market Integration in Europe and Central Asia.

218.	

In 2018, FAO continued to provide support to the Agricultural Trade Expert
Network in Europe and Central Asia (ATEN). The ATEN network brings together
experts who conduct research, carry out training programmes and advise
governments and the private sector on issues related to agricultural trade
and trade policy, including participation in regional and multilateral trade
agreements. The aim of ATEN is to promote dialogue on agricultural trade policy
issues, and support broader capacity development in this area.

219.	

Flour producers from Central Asia participated in the KazGrain conference held
on 16 March 2018 in Astana, Kazakhstan,97 and World Mill Tech98, a global milling
machinery and technology fair in Istanbul, Turkey, held from 29 March to 1 April
2018. Both events served to exchange industry-specific knowledge and establish
business relations for imports and exports.

220.	

The FMM project “Support to the development of National Action Plans on
Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) in Latin America and the Caribbean”99 was
implemented in Plurinational State of Bolivia, Cuba, Dominican Republic,
Ecuador, El Salvador and Honduras. The objective of the project was to
contribute to global efforts to contain AMR by adopting coherent, collaborative,
multidisciplinary and inter-programmatic approaches based on “One Health” to
facilitate trade and achieve the objectives of the 2030 Sustainable Development
Agenda.

-----------------------Page 56 End-----------------------

221.	

The official publication of the Guidelines for the design of awareness and advocacy
strategies for AMR was launched in March 2018 and is hosted in the FAO
repository (for the full guidelines, please see http://www.fao.org/3/i9234es/
I9234ES.pdf). While the English version was developed, it was not officially
published.

222.	

Baselining of the institutional capacities of the ministries of agriculture for the
awareness and advocacy on AMR: through a survey tool this is the first diagnosis
made in the region on this subject. It is essential to identify national gaps and
then define and support an intervention in risk communication.

223.	

Multisectoral analysis on antimicrobial resistance and its use in the livestock,
hydrobiological and agricultural production sectors: during 2018, one regional
and six national reports were finalized. The documents have been officially
delivered to national authorities of each country.

224.	

Preparation of two Concept Notes for regional projects on AMR risk assessment
was completed. The importance of AMR risk assessment in the food production
sector100 and the innovative tool developed by the project triggered the interest
of other countries in the region for technical assistance from FAO. It was
possible to define strategies for a TCP project and a project financed by the
Norwegian Agency for Development (NORAD), which include the application of
the risk assessment tool.

225.	

A Regional and Interagency Event on Gaps in Governance, Surveillance and
Containment of AMR was organized, with participation of the six beneficiary
countries, four invited countries and three international reference organizations.
Based on the assessed risk, the existing priority gaps were identified to mitigate
AMR in each sector. A preliminary analysis of the feasibility of the mitigation
measures was made.

226.	

Through a working agreement with the Pan American Association of Veterinary
Sciences (PANVET), an event was organized with leading international
experts, including the President of the World Veterinary Association (WVA).
At this event, it was possible to identify and prioritize the constraints and
priorities for the adoption of good practices for AMR in the agri–food
systems of the region. During 2018, a report of the meeting was mentioned
at FAO’s 39th Session of the Codex Alimentarius Commissio by FAO
(please see http://www.fao.org/fao-who-codexalimentarius/sh-proxy/
en/?lnk=1&url=https%253A%252F%252Fworkspace.fao.org%252Fsites%252F
codex%252FMeetings%252FCX-804-06%252FWD%252Famr06_03e.pdf).

227.	

A Regional Meeting of Experts on the use of Antimicrobials in Aquaculture in
Latin America was held pith the participation of the eight main aquaculture
producers in the region. The sanitary status of the animal populations, the use
of antimicrobials and the generation of resistance of those food systems were
analysed. A technical report of the activity was produced.

228.	

In May 2018, the activity was organized by the FAO project and Servicio Nacional
de Sanidad, Inocuidad y Calidad Agroalimentaria (SENASICA) in Mexico, with
the participation of the responsible officers for AMR in the agricultural health
services of 12 countries of the region. An evaluation of the advances in the

Flexible Multi-Partner Mechanism Annual Report 2018

-----------------------Page 57 End-----------------------

design and implementation of the National Action Plans on AMR was conducted.
The definition of recommendations was based on the technical design of FAO’s
global strategy for AMR.
229.	

The project “Strengthening capacities, policies and national action plans on aquatic
AMR”101 was implemented in Bangladesh, China, Cambodia, India, the Lao
People’s Democratic Republic, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand
and Viet Nam. The objective of this project was to strengthen capacities, policies
and national action plans on prudent and responsible use of antimicrobials in
fisheries, and develop and/or enhance the knowledge, skills and capacity, as well
as the development and implementation of policies and national action plans,
on prudent and responsible use of antimicrobials of Competent Authorities on
Fisheries and Aquaculture.

230.	

In 2018, seven regional workshops were carried out. For Component 1 on
Aquaculture Biosecurity, guidance was provided in the following aspects: (i)
development of the aquaculture component of countries’ National Action Plans
on AMR within the One Health platform; (ii) detailed steps in the design of
antimicrobial use and AMR survey. For Component 2 of Food Safety, guidance
was provided on the following aspects: (i) inspection systems to include AMR in
fish product sampling; (ii) fish product waste management; and (iii) utilization of
fish silage to reduce the need for antimicrobials for treatment.

231.	

Under Output 1, several documents were drafted and/or compiled in 2018,
including (1) Performance of antimicrobial susceptibility-testing programmes
relevant to aquaculture and aquaculture products; (2) Review of alternatives
to antimicrobials in aquaculture (vaccines, phage therapy, quorum sensing,
prebiotics, probiotics, plant therapy); (3) Fisheries and Aquaculture Technical
Paper on Understanding AMR in Aquaculture; and (4) Best practice guidance for
carp, tilapia and shrimp.

232.	

The FMM project also contributed to increased awareness and capacity building
of participating countries and other stakeholders. A total of 164 delegates
from competent authorities and other stakeholder groups from 11 countries
had improved awareness, enhanced knowledge, better understanding of AMR,
AMU, food safety and quality aspects, as well as policy, laboratory and farmlevel considerations. Communication campaigns were also carried out targeting
aquaculture professionals, producers and the general public.

Lessons learned from SO4-related projects

41

Overview

233.	

Building ownership at political and technical level and promoting multistakeholder engagement is key for the success and sustainability of the
interventions in sustainable food systems. Even if the local governments are
recognized crucial players, there are contexts where the decentralization process
is weak and therefore the national government needs to be considered as the
key player.

234.	

The programmatic approach to project formulation and implementation that
fosters synergies with ongoing FAO activities has proven to be highly effective.

-----------------------Page 58 End-----------------------

235.	

In the containment of AMR, it is crucial to continue the technical support in the
beneficiary countries, as well as in the rest of the region. The FMM project was
successful in this respect. However, it requires continuity of actions to achieve
results in a more sustainable way. FAO’s work in the field is the main mechanism
to maintain and increase its presence and leadership as a technical cooperation
agency.

Challenges
236.	

In most projects, the major challenge were time constraints for the
implementation of activities. This was especially the case for island nations
where implementation is extremely slow due to geographical distances between
islands. The time it took to discuss and agree on roles and responsibilities
among partners was considerable.

237.	

237.	 Another related challenge was reliance on a large number of partners,
which carries some risks and drawbacks. It also takes time to build trust, buy-in
and ownership by stakeholders and beneficiaries. Some partners proved to be
more reliable and effective than others.

-----------------------Page 59 End-----------------------

General experiences, lessons
and spin-off effects
4.1. Technical experiences and lessons
238.	

	Some important technical lessons were learned during implementation of the
various FMM projects in 2018. One of the key lessons learned highlighted the
importance of building capacities at various levels. The capacity building events
supported by the FMM projects had a multiplier effect in leading to new activities
and dissemination of knowledge. For example, there is evidence that the
capacity development workshops resulted in increased collaboration between
organizations attending national or sub-regional capacity development activities.
Direct exchange of concerns, experiences and possibilities for solutions among
the participants created the desire to create spaces in which collaboration
between organizations could continue after the workshops.

239.	

Another key lesson was learnt in the area of partnerships. Stakeholders
acknowledge the value of regional collaboration and exchange as a good way to
transfer knowledge, sensitize policymakers and mutualize tools and approaches.
However, significant investments are required, both in terms of time and
financial resources, to facilitate these multi-country processes.

240.	

A third useful lesson learned is the importance of getting youth beneficiaries
on board at the beginning of projects, as partners, champions and service
providers. The innovation potential of direct engagement of the youth is huge,
not only to ensure sustainability, but also to push forward the modernization of
communication strategies and approaches and tools, with potential extended
benefits.

241.	

In most projects, the major challenge were time constraints for the
implementation of activities. There were also some challenges specific to
implementation of certain thematic areas. For example, significant challenges
exist in the coordination of the multiple ongoing climate and development
planning processes, in particular those related to NAPs, SDGs and NDCs. The
NDC and SDG agendas were generally defined and advanced separately or under
distinct national coordination frameworks and led by different institutions in a
country. This separation between planning and implementation tracks results
in relatively limited alignment and synergy between the specific climate actions
supporting the NDCs and the national targets underpinning the SDGs. This often
led to duplication of effort and separation of information, capacity and policymaking into silos. The challenges related to NDC implementation are particularly
pronounced in the agriculture sector.

4.1.1. Catalytic effects and leveraging
242.	

43

One of the main tenets of the FMM is its catalytic investments in strategic
priorities, initiatives and activities that can drive transformative change,
innovation and value-for-money in areas that are not adequately funded through
regular programmes and projects. Most FMM projects had catalytic or multiplier

-----------------------Page 60 End-----------------------

effects, such as the mobilization of investment funds or scaling-up of activities,
and galvanized greater support from governments and donor. This section
highlights such effects focussing more on outstanding examples.
243.	

The inventory of 500 FAO knowledge products on climate change action in the
agricultural sector undertaken as part of the National Adaptation Plans project
supported by FMM, now serves as the basis for a public platform known as the
“Climate and Land Hub”. Drawing on further funding from the Government of
Germany, a beta version of this platform has now been launched. This platform
presents a one-stop shop for guidance and tools for planners, policymakers
and climate-change negotiators working on scaling up climate action in the
agricultural sector. An additional USD 5 million has been made available from
the Provincial Government of Quebec to work on climate change adaptation
in Haiti and Senegal through the project “Strengthening National Adaptation
Planning capacities for Food Security and Nutrition”102.

244.	

Under the Sustainable Food and Agriculture project, the FMM allowed FAO
to develop a coherent, integrated approach across FAO’s technical units
and sectors. At the 26th Meeting of the Committee on Agriculture (COAG)
2018, member states requested FAO to continue its support to countries in
mainstreaming sustainable food and agriculture in the 2030 Agenda in an
integrated way (for the official declaration, please see https://bit.ly/3367rMg).

245.	

245.	 developed in Sao Tome and Principe and Côte d’Ivoire leveraging on
African Development Bank resources. Similarly, fisheries and aquaculture Green
Climate Fund Readiness proposals were formulated in the Caribbean and Pacific.

246.	

The Restoration of Degraded Lands project helped the mobilization of additional
financial resources with a project agreement signed with France in January
2018. The Restoration Initiative thematic programme was launched in 2018, and
is awaiting for the final phase of clearance of the proposal by IKI. Additional
resource mobilization efforts were under way to prepare GEF-7 projects in
Guinea and Madagascar, and a GCF grant in Uganda. The national Work Plans in
Cambodia, Lebanon and the Philippines have also included financial resources
mobilization for national FLR initiatives from the diaspora, the private sector,
and the climate finance mechanisms.

247.	

As a result of the success of the project Integrated Country Approach for Decent
Rural Youth Employment, a third phase was prepared for implementation by
2019. The new project will build on the results achieved in Guatemala, Senegal
and Uganda and replicate the experience in Kenya and Rwanda.

248.	

The FMM work spurred increased regional uptake of country outputs of the
Enabling Rural Youth between 15 and 17 Years of Age to Access Decent Work
project. For example, the Arabic version of the guidebook on child labour in
agriculture developed in Lebanon is being disseminated in other Arab countries,
addressing the issue of child labour. The RNE regional initiative on small-scale
family farming also contributed funding for a regional study on child labour in
agriculture. FMM work under this project is also being scaled up by UN partners.
The pesticide visual guide was translated into a storybook for children together
with UNICEF. Additional visual tools for promoting occupational safety and
health for young workers in the age group of 15-to-17-year-olds are also being
developed by ILO.

249.	

Different stakeholders have acknowledged the importance of the DIMITRA Clubs
approach for community mobilization, gender equality and empowerment. The
FMM mechanism continues to be crucial to trigger tangible social, economic
and environmental transformations in rural areas of sub-Saharan Africa. The
DIMITRA Clubs approach is being increasingly used as an entry point for other
activities in larger programmes, and as such has catalyzed mobilization of
additional resources. More than 25 FAO country projects used or were planning
to use the DIMITRA Club approach as at May 2018 in several Sub-Saharan African
countries.

250.	

With regard to the Decent Rural Employment project, a third phase of the
ICA programme was finalized. Furthermore, collaboration between the ICA
programme and new project proposals in the area of youth employment
and rural migration is under way. In Senegal, the MIJA platforms will likely be
adopted as implementation model for vulnerable youth in the forthcoming
adaptation of the AfDB Enable Youth programme titled “Projet de Développement
de l’Entreprenariat des Jeunes dans l’Agriculture et l’Agroalimentaire au Sénégal”. To
streamline this process, a new Technical Cooperation Facility project has been
created.

251.	

Because of the successful implementation of the pilot phase, the Forest and Farm
Facility project secured an additional USD 18 million for Phase II (2018–2022).
In Guatemala, FFF has helped the FAO Country Representation to secure USD 7
million from the Korean International Cooperation Agency (KOICA) for a threeyear integrated programme (2019–2021) with FFPOs as primary actors.

252.	

The project Expansion of Social Protection Coverage to the Rural Poor in Lebanon,
Mali, Lesotho and Zambia has also had important catalytic effects. In Lebanon,
the government is now prepared to scale up the farmer registry at national
level through a recently approved European Union-funded project titled
Regional Trust Fund in response to the Syrian crisis (named MADAD), with a
total funding of EUR 25 million (EUR 1.2 million dedicated to scaling up) for 24
months starting from January 2019. In Lesotho, there is a discussion among the
Government and other stakeholders about the Community Development Model
and its implementation via Livelihood Programme funded with a World Bank
loan. In Zambia, FAO joined the UN Joint Programme (UNJP) in March 2018 and
is currently leading the work to support the Livelihoods and Empowerment pillar
of the programme. FAO is supporting the development of a management and
information system called the Zambia Integrated Social Protection Information
System under the Ministry of Community Development.

253.	

The activities under the Global Initiative on Food Loss and Waste Reduction
stimulated complementary funding from the Rockefeller Foundation and the
regular programme through RAF’s Regional Initiative 2. This helped to create a
linkage between country-level food loss reduction strategies and programmes of
the African Union’s Malabo Declaration and the target of halving of post-harvest
losses by 2025.

254.	

The Developing Sustainable Food Systems for Urban areas (or NADHALI) is another
example of a project with very good catalytic effects. It has led to increased
interest among stakeholders and resulted in mobilization of more resources.
In Dhaka, a follow-up proposal based on NADHALI raised USD 12.5 million

General experiences, lessons and spin-off effects

-----------------------Page 62 End-----------------------

for a five-year project from the Dutch Government. In Nairobi, a project will
start in 2019 with Italian government funds that will put in operation many of
the actions recommended in the food system strategy. In addition, a threeyear project worth USD 2.1 million was developed to include Kisumu. In Lima,
additional funds were sourced through a technical cooperation programme
(TCP) at the end of 2018, which will also promote good local food governance
mechanisms based on experiences of NADHALI. An agreement was signed at
the end of 2018 between FAO and the World Bank for USD 350 000 to develop
the first-phase study for generating knowledge that will guide selection of cities
where good local food governance will be promoted.
255.	

Under the Trade Related Capacity Development in Eastern Europe and Central Asia
project, opportunities for working with the industry association in developing
new markets was explored. FAO’s Investment Centre Division (DPI) developed
and signed a new technical assistance project on export-market development in
Ukraine with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) in
2018.

256.	

The project Support to the development of National Action Plans on Antimicrobial
Resistance (AMR) in Latin America and the Caribbean has also generated formal
requests for FAO technical assistance on AMR from Plurinational State of
Bolivia, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Paraguay, Peru and Uruguay – countries that
were not beneficiaries of the project. Likewise, the six beneficiary countries
have requested FAO for the continuity of the actions, considering that the work
maintained high quality standards. The intervention on AMR awareness-raising
established the basis for the formation of a regional communications network
for AMR. The professionals trained in the project have replicated the knowledge
acquired among their national counterparts, using the tools designed by the
project. The creation of National AMR Committees and the formulation of
National Action Plans are outstanding examples of catalytic effects derived from
the project.

4.1.2. Partnerships
257.	

Over the years, the FMM had established fruitful partnerships at the global,
regional and country levels, with multiple partnerships from government
ministries, universities, other UN organizations, the private sector and CSOs.
During the reporting period (2018), all projects supported by the FMM have
consolidating partnerships built in earlier years (reported in the 2014–2017 midterm final report) while also building new ones.

258.	

Examples of FMM projects that were particularly successful in building new
partnerships include the Blue Growth Initiative, the Integrated Country Approach
for Decent Rural Youth Employment (ICA), the DIMITRA Clubs, the Agribusinesses
and Agri–Food Chains project and the Global Initiative on Food Loss and Waste
Reduction.

259.	

The Blue Growth Initiative developed partnership with the Blue Innovations
Centre based in Grenada, Spain, in 2018. It also built a partnership with the
African Development Bank, which is collaborating, with FAO to secure funding
for the development of Blue Growth project portfolio in Sao Tome and Principe
and Côte d’Ivoire.

Flexible Multi-Partner Mechanism Annual Report 2018

-----------------------Page 63 End-----------------------

260.	

The ICA project partnered with the Young
Farmers Champions Network in Uganda.
It also partnered with the Federación
Nacional de Cafeteros de Colombia, which
engaged in a South–South Cooperation
(SSC) exchange with Guatemala for the
adaptation of their successful initiative
“New Coffee Generation”. In Senegal,
a collaboration was established with
UNIDO and CTA, and among several
FAO technical units, to enhance the MIJA
platform model in terms of its business
approach and use of ICT.

The Developing
Sustainable Food
Systems for Urban Areas
(NADHALI) Project: an
exemplary catalytic effect
•	

In Bangladesh, the NADHALI project
led to mobilization of USD12.5 million
from the Dutch government for a five
year project.

•	

In Kenya, a project proposal for funding
by the Italian government will put
into operation many of the actions
recommended in the food system
strategy in Nairobi. In addition, a three
year project worth USD 2.1 million was
developed to include Kisumu.

261.	

The DIMITRA Clubs project expanded
partnerships in a number of countries.
Indeed, there was a 40-percent increase
of new partnerships between June 2017
and May 2018. This translated in the first
months of 2018 into an additional 1 000
new DIMITRA Clubs.

262.	

The main partnerships established under
the Agribusinesses and Agri–Food Chains
project in 2018 include the United Nations Institute for Training and Research
(UNITAR) and the Association de Coordination Technique pour l’Industrie Agroalimentaire (ACTIA) of France.

263.	

The Global Initiative on Food Loss and Waste Reduction expanded the range
of partners beyond the ministries responsible for primary production in the
agriculture, fisheries and livestock sectors, to include others covering postproduction issues and aspects such as trade, infrastructure, finance and
investments. Partnerships were developed with these ministries, universities
and value-chain actors, including farmers, traders and processors. A strong
partnership was developed with the African Union Commission because this
project is providing assistance in the assessment of food-loss reduction against
the Malabo Declaration targets.

4.1.3. Capacity development

47

264.	

Capacity development is a core function in FAO’s strategic framework, and it is
a key to sustainable results at country-level and ensures that FAO’s efforts lead
to lasting changes. FAO Members place a strong emphasis on FAO enhancing
delivery in this area, as endorsed by the Corporate Strategy on Capacity
Development. In 2018, most of the FMM projects successfully implemented
capacity development activities, including the development of training materials,
the organization of training workshops and training-of-trainers. In this section
some of the outstanding results achieved in 2018 are reported.

265.	

In the VGGT project, 243 people were trained at country-level and 53 were
sensitized to the VGGT through the regional activities. A Learning Guide was
adapted to the VGGT and the Voluntary Guidelines for Securing Sustainable

General experiences, lessons and spin-off effects

-----------------------Page 64 End-----------------------

Small-Scale Fisheries in the Context of Food Security and Poverty Eradication.
Training workshops on the VGGT and SSF-G were organized in Argentina, Brazil,
Honduras, Peru, South Africa, Sri Lanka, Uganda and the United Republic of
Tanzania, and a total of 280 people were trained. The Learning Guide was also
adapted to the pastoralist context and tested in Mongolia. The VGGT project also
developed a fully responsive mobile course designed and developed in support
of CSOs to enhance capacities on the VGGT.
266.	

The Restoration of Degraded Lands project implemented a comprehensive
set of capacity development activities at local, national, regional and global
scales in 2018. At the Global level, online tools were provided on concepts and
infrastructure for an FLR knowledge platform, online Community of Practice
on FLR monitoring and SFM toolbox. At the national level, a one-week training
was provided on ROAM in Manila in the context of the implementation of FLR
work plan in the Philippines. Collect Earth Open Foris training was organized in
Lebanon, Rwanda and the Sahel region.

267.	

Under the Integrated Country Approach for Decent Rural Youth Employment, at the
global level, the DRE toolbox was produced in 2018 as an online repository of
all FAO guidance materials, case studies and good practices.103 The DRE Policy
database has been expanded with over 1 000 entries, and now acts as an online
repository for DRE policies.104

268.	

The project Enabling rural youth between 15 and 17 Years of Age to Access Decent
Work developed, adapted and promoted an e-learning tool on child labour
prevention and youth employment promotion. In addition, two modules on
financial literacy and education for rural youth were developed. One module for
formal education was tested in the seven agricultural high schools of Lebanon.
Another module for informal education and school dropouts was finalized and is
planned to be tested.

269.	

Under the project Fostering Productive Investments to Create Decent Farm and nonFarm Jobs for Rural Youth in Migration-Prone Areas in Senegal a four-day capacity
development workshop was jointly organized by FAO and the Directorate
responsible for migration. This workshop was attended by 30 facilitators working
in different support mechanisms for migration initiatives. The participants
received training to understand the linkages between migration and rural
development and the existing government initiatives.

270.	

Under the Agricultural Services and Digital Inclusion in Africa project, a training
workshop was organized in March 2018 in Senegal. The workshop aimed to test
with around 50 participants in each country the first version of the application to
show how it works, test its usability and gather a first set of feedbacks.

271.	

A total of 65 people were trained in food loss assessment in Kenya, Zambia and
Zimbabwe under the Global Initiative on Food Loss and Waste Reduction. These
included extension staff, students, farmers and other value chain actors and
NGOs.

272.	

Under the NADHALI project, more than 120 officials and stakeholders were
trained in both Lima, Peru, and Nairobi, Kenya, on the importance of integrating
food systems in local policy, plans and actions. Knowledge generated on

Flexible Multi-Partner Mechanism Annual Report 2018

48

-----------------------Page 65 End-----------------------

RUFSAT methodology and its use for planning in both Lima and Nairobi was also
disseminated.
273.	

A number of capacity development activities were also implemented under the
project Linking SDGs 1 and 2 through pro-poor inclusive value chain development in
the context of SIDS in 2018. Training activities were conducted for a total of 143
farmers, extension workers and private business representatives on planning
and implementing contract-farming operations in Fiji, Solomon Islands, Tonga
and Vanuatu. The understanding of the 21 SDG indicators were enhanced
through a regional training workshop involving 26 representatives of national
statistics offices and ministries of agriculture from 10 member countries in the
Pacific and representatives of regional organizations.

274.	

Under the Inclusive Value Chain Development in Africa project, 39 extension
officers and lead farmers from eleven countries attended a three-week practical
training at the Songhai Centre in Benin in March 2018. Business mentorship was
also provided to 50 SMAEs.

275.	

The Trade Related Capacity Development in Eastern and Southern Africa project
facilitated two e-Learning courses and a regional dialogue in Arusha, Kenya,
where 17 course participants from countries in Eastern and Southern Africa took
part. The dialogue covered issues relevant to agriculture in international trade
agreements.

276.	

The project Trade Related Capacity Development in Eastern Europe and Central Asia
supported a number of events leading to capacity development. A workshop
on export promotion held in Moscow, the Russian Federation, was attended by
36 participants. The workshop provided participants with information on the
best practices of agri–food export promotion of several European and Central
Asian countries. Honey producers from Kyrgyzstan, Moldova and Tajikistan also
benefited from the one-day training, where they learned about global honey
market developments, sanitary barriers to trade, preparation for European
Union food-safety audits and developing honey traceability system. Through
FMM support, the Union of Millers of Ukraine organized two training sessions
in cooperation with Grain Processors Union of Kazakhstan, the Committee of
Millers of the Union of Entrepreneurs of Kyrgyzstan in 2018. Technical support
was provided to the Ministry of Agriculture of Georgia for the installation of the
FPMA Tool. Participants from the Ministry of Agriculture, the National Statistics
Agency, and the International School of Economics at Tblisi State University
attended the training.

277.	

Under the project titled Support to the development of National Action Plans
on Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) in Latin America and the Caribbean, a total of
167 trainers were trained in the containment of AMR under the One Health
approach.

4.1.4. Policy advice
278.	

49

FAO promotes, facilitates and supports evidence-based policy dialogue at
the global, regional, and national levels. The FAO policy vision is shaped
by the Organization’s work at the national and regional levels. A number
of FMM projects have provided policy advice during this reporting period.

General experiences, lessons and spin-off effects

-----------------------Page 66 End-----------------------

Some projects also produced information and guidance products useful to
inform policy-making. For example, the VGGT served as a reference tool at the
multi-stakeholder level when drafting tenure policies or legislation. Similarly,
projection of future climate and crop production produced under the Building
the Basis for Scaling Up Climate Smart Agriculture project were shared among the
relevant stakeholders to support the implementation of the National Agriculture
Policy and other relevant policy instruments. Policy advice was also provided
on the development of Blue Growth strategies and programmes to Bangladesh,
Côte d’Ivoire, Madagascar, and Sao Tome and Principe through meetings and
dialogues.
279.	

Some FMM projects have also contributed to the creation of platforms for policy
dialogue. For example, the Restoration of Degraded Lands project facilitated
the cross-sectoral working group for agriculture and natural resources in
Rwanda. This resulted in the preparation of a national cross-sectoral strategy
and action plan for agroforestry in Rwanda. The project also facilitated four
thematic working groups for the preparation of the National Program for the
Recuperation of Degraded Lands in Peru. In Lebanon, the project provided
a comparative analysis of legislation aiming at identifying barriers to FLR
investments and adapting the policy and legal frameworks.

280.	

The Integrated Country Approach for Decent Rural Youth Employment project
influenced high-visibility policy processes in the beneficiary countries, leading
to the development of youth-specific policies and strategies. These include the
Youth in Agriculture Strategy in Guatemala, the Axis 3 of the National Decent
Work Policy in Guatemala and the National Strategy for Youth Employment in
Agriculture in Uganda.

281.	

Under the project, Fostering Productive Investments to Create Decent Farm and
Non-Farm Jobs for Rural Youth in Migration-Prone Areas in Senegal a mapping
of all the policies and programmes related to migration and agriculture and
rural development, as well as the main institutions and actors was produced.
Policy recommendations are structured around four main work areas: analysis,
capacity development, partnerships, and advocacy. The consultations held in the
14 regions of Senegal also resulted in a continued policy dialogue and inputs to
the implementation of the new migration policy.

282.	

The results of the project Expansion of Social Protection Coverage to The Rural Poor
in Lebanon, Mali, Lesotho and Zambia are also feeding into policy discussions.
For example, in Lesotho the main messages and policy advices were distilled in
a policy brief. Similarly, in Mali, a policy brief on an integrated social protection
and productive support package was written. In Zambia, the project developed a
concept note describing an approach to facilitating policy dialogue on the role of
agriculture in reducing poverty. This concept note will inform advocacy work on
the policy reform options.

283.	

Policy advices was the core element of the national-level activities of the project
Trade related capacity development in Eastern and Southern Africa implemented
in Mozambique, the United Republic of Tanzania and Zambia.The project
supported the beneficiary countries to improve implementation of the trade
agreements including the WTO agreement on agriculture and agreements
pertinent to COMESA, EAC and SADC.

284.	

The project Strengthening Capacities, Policies and National Action Plans on
Prudent and Responsible Use of Antimicrobials in Fisheries helped in establishing
governance and policy dialogue mechanisms including creation of a task force,
working group and steering committee, and initiated multisectoral coordination
meetings. It also contributed to more explicit contribution of the aquatic
component to the country NAP, formalization of the NAP on AMR and review of
AMR-relevant legislation in this reporting period.

4.1.5. Gender mainstreaming

51

285.	

Women, youth and indigenous people tend be disadvantaged in terms of
access to land and resources, education and opportunities to participate in
development processes. Therefore, eliminating gender inequalities in agriculture
and empowering rural women is crucial to achieving FAO’s mandate of food
security and nutrition, in line with the pledge to ‘leave no one behind’ of the
Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development. Accordingly, FAO provides technical
advice to member countries and strengthens their capacities to formulate,
implement and monitor policies and programmes that provide women and men
with equal opportunities to benefit from agricultural and rural development. As
a central theme of FAO’s mandate, gender is addressed as a cross-cutting theme
in the Strategic Framework.

286.	

Generating knowledge on good practices, institutional mechanisms and
policy options for strengthening women’s participation and leadership in
rural institutions and organizations, and shaping policies, programmes and
investments in agriculture and food security, are some of the priority areas of
FAO’s Rural Women’s Economic Empowerment initiative. The Policy Guidance
Note on Gender Equality, developed by FAO together with the European Union,
has been used to promote the integration of gender equality issues in national
food security and nutrition (FSN) policies and strategies by strengthening the
capacities for gender analysis in most projects (for the full document, please see
http://www.fao.org/3/a-i7218e.pdf).

287.	

Analysing gender disparities in rural employment and promoting approaches
for advancing rural women’s economic empowerment and decent employment,
through policies and programmes is a further priority area of FAO’s Rural
Women’s Economic Empowerment initiative. In 2018, FAO continued to support
the generation and dissemination of gender-disaggregated data to document
the situation of rural women around the world and build the evidence-base for
policy-making and programme formulation. In total, 16 new Country Gender
Assessments were finalized in 2018, providing governments and development
partners with an updated gender profile of agriculture and rural livelihoods.105

288.	

A number of FMM projects implemented in 2018 also had an explicit gender
equity component. Outstanding among these is the DIMITRA Clubs project. The
DIMITRA Clubs approach combined the use of ICTs with gender transformative
and community-driven processes. In this dynamic, ICTs are enablers for women’s
empowerment, social inclusion and improved dialogue in rural areas. By making
use of ICTs in support of a transformative process led by rural communities,
the DIMITRA Clubs ensure inclusive participation and ownership of the actions
undertaken and, thus, sustainability. The FAO publication Gender and ICTs Mainstreaming gender in the use of information and communication technologies

General experiences, lessons and spin-off effects

-----------------------Page 68 End-----------------------

(ICTs) for agriculture and rural development produced in 2018 is an examples that
illustrates the DIMITRA Clubs as a good practice in the areas of communication
for development and ICTs (for the full publication, please see http://www.fao.
org/3/i8670en/I8670EN.pdf).
289.	

While significant progress has been made in mainstreaming gender in various
FMM projects, there is still scope for doing more and doing it better. In
order to reduce gender inequalities and achieve greater women’s economic
empowerment in rural areas, FAO will strengthen coordination mechanisms
within and continue to work jointly with different partners. FAO is building on
activities under way in the countries covered by the UN Joint Programme (FAO–
IFAD–WFP–UN Women) on Rural Women’s Economic Empowerment. FAO will
also develop strategic partnerships with key institutions working on gender
issues, including: (i) UN Agencies (ILO, UN Women, IFAD, WFP, World Bank) for
all matters related to the promotion of rural women’s economic empowerment;
and (ii) CGIAR (especially IFPRI and the International Water Management Institute
(IWMI)), particularly in relation to knowledge generation, capacity development
and policy support for developing conceptual frameworks and elaborating
policy-support and programmatic tools for effective and gender-equitable rural
poverty reduction.

4.1.6. Innovation
290.	

Innovation is the process by which individuals or organisations bring new
or existing products, processes or ways of organization into use to increase
effectiveness, competitiveness and resilience with the goal of solving a problem.
FAO believes that innovation is the central driving force for achieving a world
free from hunger and malnutrition, where food and agriculture contribute to
reducing poverty in an economically, socially and environmentally sustainable
way. One of the most significant impacts of the FMM-supported projects was
the introduction of new innovations. A number of FMM projects have piloted or
demonstrated new products, approaches and ideas to countries. Outstanding
examples of innovations achieved by FMM projects in the reporting period are
briefly described here.

291.	

291.	 One such example is seen in the Sustainable Food and Agriculture project.
This project integrated coherent approaches to sustainable food and agriculture,
which supports a transformation of food and agricultural systems towards
sustainability, considering all of its main dimensions and operationalizing the
intentions of the SDGs in the food and agricultural sectors.

292.	

Similarly, the Integrated Country Approach for Decent Rural Youth Employment
project continued to spur development of new tools, approaches and
methodologies in 2018. One of the good examples is the development of a
tool to conduct youth-employment-focused value-chain analysis in Uganda’s
coffee value chain. Another example is the use of ICT for enhancing youth
access to extension and employment services in remote areas, as demonstrated
by the Chisparural.gt platform in Guatemala and the National Employment
Observatory in Senegal. These services were designed to enhance youth access
to information, service providers and financial opportunities like crowdfunding
platforms.

Flexible Multi-Partner Mechanism Annual Report 2018

52

-----------------------Page 69 End-----------------------

293.	

In the DIMITRA Clubs project, the Whatsapp groups set up proved to be a useful
tool to exchange good practices, pictures and videos, and to ask for advice. It has
also worked as a powerful training instrument for the DIMITRA Clubs facilitators
and implementing partners.

294.	

The Digital Value Added Services developed in the Agricultural Services and Digital
Inclusion in Africa project were designed to provide high-quality information
services close to family farmers and extension workers such as veterinarians,
agricultural extension agents and nutrition experts, using innovative and the
most convenient digital technologies. The services were also designed paying
special attention to the specific needs of women and youth.

4.1.7. Cross-sectoral work

53

295.	

Cross-sectoral issues refer to those issues where the actions of one sector
impact upon one or more other sectors. Cross-sectoral coordination is critical
for advancing global goals such as the SDGs at the national level and these can
be complemented by multi-stakeholder collaboration inclusive of government,
civil society and the private sector at multiple levels. Over the years, a number of
FMM projects have stimulated cross-sectoral work both within and outside FAO,
stimulating synergies and more integrated visions. The focus of this section is to
present outstanding examples of cross-sectoral work implemented in 2018.

296.	

The VGGT project addressed land, fisheries and forest governance and tenure
issues. In 2018, the project continued its collaborations with land tenure officers
at FAO headquarters and the regional level, and the partnership officers, FAO’s
Capacity Development Team for the development of the e-learning, and the
Fishery Division for the adaptation of the Learning Guide for VGGT/SSFVG.

297.	

In the National Adaptation Plans project multi-stakeholder processes were
facilitated with cross-sectoral dialogue between ministries of agriculture,
environment and planning, UNDP and FAO to support the integration of
agricultural issues into NAPs. The project has specifically fostered cross-sectoral
work across the fields of agriculture, meteorology, environment, climate change
adaptation, mitigation and disaster risk reduction as well as gender.

298.	

Similarly, the Integrated Country Approach for Decent Rural Youth Employment
project continued to support cross-sectoral work among ministries of
agriculture, labour, economy and social affairs, as well as with planning
authorities, territorial and local authorities, CSOs and youth organizations.
Within FAO, the project facilitated exchanges between different technical units,
DOs and SO teams on the issue of decent rural youth employment. Collaboration
was strengthened in particular with the Social Policies and Rural Institutions
Division leading the ICA project.

299.	

The work in the Agribusinesses and Agri–Food Chains project has been crosssectoral from its onset. Both within FAO and among its external partners, the
project involved the sectors of agriculture, fisheries, agro-industries, retail, input
supply and services provision. It also involved the disciplines of food science
and technology, natural resources, climate change, rural sociology and gender,
economics, nutrition, food security, food quality and safety, statistics and
communications.

General experiences, lessons and spin-off effects

-----------------------Page 70 End-----------------------

300.	

The Trade Related Capacity Development in Eastern and Southern Africa project
looked at agriculture as part of broader food systems, going beyond the specific
sectoral issues and focusing on how agriculture, food security and nutrition
are affected by the policies developed and implemented by other sectors.
In particular, the project focused on strengthening capacities to analyse and
address the impacts of trade and related policies and agreements, in an effort
to facilitate a closer, more systematic and long-lasting collaboration between the
agriculture and trade ministries.

4.1.8. Alignment and sustainability
All FMM projects are well aligned with national development strategies and provided
support to activities fully aligned with the United Nations Development Assistance
Framework (UNDAF) and Country Programme Framework (CPF). The UNDAF is a
strategic, medium-term results framework that describes the collective vision and
response of the UN system to national development priorities and results on the
basis of normative programming principles. It describes how UN Country Teams will
contribute to the achievement of development results based on a common country
analysis and UN comparative advantage. The 2017 UNDAF guidance supports UN
Country Teams to position themselves to provide quality support to member states in
their aspiration to achieve the 2030 Agenda (for the full guidance document, please use
https://unsdg.un.org/sites/default/files/2017-UNDAF_Guidance_01-May-2017.pdf).
On the other hand, the CPF is a tool for the FAO country-level strategic prioritization and
overall medium-term country-level programming, and as such it constitutes FAO’s input
to the national development frameworks and planning cycles, as well as into the UNDAF.
The CPF is prepared following consultations and agreement with member states. The
project outputs were also closely linked to the Regional Initiative and FAO Investment
Centre (TCI) projects, ensuring their successful implementation. The alignment of FMM
activities to UNDAF and CPF and the linkage to the Regional Initiative and TCI projects
guarantees sustainability of the results.
301.	

Over the years, many of the projects were also aligned with the SDGs and
promoted governance change towards a common vision of sustainability across
sectors. Most projects were also successful in consolidating partnerships built in
earlier years and in the formation of multi-stakeholder platforms at the regional
and national levels. These have improved multi-stakeholder dialogue, ensuring
that rural women and men have the ability to influence policy decision-making.
These can be cited as key drivers of sustainability of FMM results.

4.2. Programme experiences and lessons
302.	

The FMM employed a programmatic approach to project formulation and
implementation that fosters synergies with ongoing FAO activities. Over the
years, this has proven to be highly effective. In the following sections, challenges
in governance, operations and financial arrangements are discussed briefly.

4.2.1. Governance arrangements, management, coordination and
resource allocation
303.	

One of the key lessons learnt in the implementation of the FMM was that a
streamlined governance arrangement is needed that is effective for decision-

Flexible Multi-Partner Mechanism Annual Report 2018

54

-----------------------Page 71 End-----------------------

making and prioritization of resources, oversight and support to resource
mobilization. The FMM has evolved over time, has continued to be improved
and by 2018 good progress had been made in revamping the FMM, for instance
streamlining its governance arrangement, developing a solid theory of change,
defining clear criteria and applying a programmatic framework for allocating
resources. Drawing from the evaluation of FMM, the resource mobilization and
operational modalities were transformed into a successful funding model to
mobilize a greater volume of flexible resources.
304.	

As indicated in the 2014–2017 medium-term final report, the FMM is not yet
fully operating as a pooled programmatic funding mechanism. The financial
arrangement of FMM was also described to lack sufficient clarity. Some of the
resource partner contributions continued to be loosely attached to particular
themes or regions. The contributions also had a fixed lifespan.

4.2.2. Operational challenges
305.	

306.	

55

Among the common operational
challenges encountered in the
implementation of the various
projects was the short time frame in
which to implement and coordinate
several sets of activities that often
require sequencing. It also takes time
to obtain trust, buy-in and ownership
by stakeholders and beneficiaries.
Reliance on a large number of
partners also carries some risks
and delays in operation. Some
partners proved to be more reliable
and effective than others. In some
cases, the project was ready to
implement, but stakeholders were
not, and time was needed to hold
consultations, explain the expected
benefits and gain trust. Time is also
needed to evaluate the results of
the various activities, learn lessons
and assess impacts. This highlights
that it is crucial to account for (to
the extent possible) for all risks to
the project, including delays in FAO
procedures, changes in governments
and insufficient human resources
in national agencies to implement
activities.

General experiences, lessons and spin-off effects

Key lessons learned
Programmatically, key lessons include
the following:
•	

Increased level of volume of flexible
and predictable funding are needed for
the Flexible Multi-Partner Mechanism
(FMM) to produce major transformative
impacts.

•	

In order to reduce fragmentation, and
create synergies and value-for-money,
there is a need to move from projectthinking to a truly programmatic
approach.

•	

Improved reporting, documentation
and monitoring is key – the FMM needs
strong technical oversight and early and
continuous engagement with project
implementers to identify options for
monitoring, reporting, raising visibility
and fostering cross-SP collaboration and
synergies to obtain desired outcomes.

•	

The FMM coordination unit needs to be
adequately staffed – with a dedicated
senior professional officer and one
general support staff at the minimum;
this will help to meet expectations
on quality, backstopping support to
programme planning and project cycles,
lesson-learning, documentation and
efficiency, donor liaison, and technical
oversight, as noted in the evaluation
reports.

-----------------------Page 72 End-----------------------

4.2.3. Reporting and documentation
307.	

In the past, the quality of FMM reporting and documentation was generally
considered minimal, particularly at programme level. The FMM medium-term
report has now set a higher standard for reporting, which was launched in
2018. During the reporting period, there was thus a significant improvement in
reporting and documentation. Results of FMM are now linked to the corporate
reporting system under each Strategic Programme.

4.2.4. Marketing and visibility
308.	

Over the years, the FMM raised awareness and engaged in fundraising actions
with key resource partners. In 2018, significant efforts were made to raise the
visibility of FMM to the wider public through various publicity materials (for
example, please see https://bit.ly/3cG2HkO and https://bit.ly/2TONEg8). As
a result, some resource partners already renewed their commitments in the
new phase of FMM. These include the governments of Belgium (2018–2020),
Italy (2019), Sweden (2018–2021) and Switzerland (2018–2019). Other new
resource partners have joined in 2019, including France and Italy. Others are
also preparing or negotiating their new commitments. Accordingly, the FMM has
been re-positioned as a flexible funding instrument in in its second phase.

Conclusions and looking
forward
309.	

In conclusion, this report has demonstrated that the FMM delivered on the
results planned for 2018 under the SOs, namely Contribution To Eradication Of
Hunger, Food Insecurity and Nutrition (SO1), Making Agriculture More Productive
and Sustainable (SO2), Reduce Rural Poverty (SO3) and Enabling Inclusive and
Efficient Agri–Food Systems (SO4). Overall, the FMM projects directly addressed
at least ten of the 17 SDGs. The FMM has helped FAO to successfully implement
and deliver on its Strategic framework. In particular, the FMM has demonstrated
how flexible funding can promote integration across sectors, create new and
powerful partnerships, contribute to transformative impacts and support the
delivery of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the SDGs.

310.	

FMM funds have been crucial in supporting important areas of work such as
climate-smart agriculture (CSA), helped to test the common vision for sustainable
food and agriculture (SFA), and boosted the implementation of the Blue Growth
initiative, decent rural employment (DRE), gender-sensitive value chains, and
digital inclusion, which are central to FAO’s work today. Access to FMM resources
has also enabled FAO to take a strong strategic leadership role in the area of
DRE and child labour in partnership with ILO, national governments and civil
society organizations (CSOs). Thanks to FMM, this important but an underfunded
area of FAO’s work benefitted from a dedicated team and a comprehensive
programme. DRE, which had relied entirely on FMM for three years, is now an
Outcome (002) under FAO’s Strategic Objective 3 (SO3).

311.	

The gender-sensitive value-chain framework provides the principles for the
integration of gender concerns into value chain development projects and
programmes. The FMM programme, “Enabling Women to Benefit More Equally
from Agri–Food Value Chains” which was implemented in eight countries in Africa,
is an example of gender-sensitive value-chain analysis.

312.	

Similarly, FMM resources contributed to tackling emerging global challenges
such as antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in the fisheries, livestock and agricultural
production sectors. Increasing global Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) endangers
modern human and veterinary health management and compromises the safety
of our food and our environment. The work supported by FMM is contributing
to the global efforts to contain AMR by adopting coherent, collaborative,
multidisciplinary and multisectoral approaches based on the “One Health”
principle.

313.	

In addition, the FMM has stimulated innovation, by supporting the development
of new methodologies and practices and the exploration of new research
frontiers. For example, FAO developed the Food Insecurity Experience Scale
(FIES), which is a direct measure of food insecurity comparable across countries
in the world. This innovative tool was selected as an indicator to measure global
progress towards achieving the SDG 2 Target 2.1 (Ending hunger by 2030).
Further, FMM funding catalyzed the dissemination of new concepts and ideas in
the participating countries as well as the wider development partner community.
These are only examples.

-----------------------Page 74 End-----------------------

314.	

Beyond the delivery of concrete results contributing to progress toward the
realization of the SOs, the FMM has also revealed its manifold advantages, many
of them with a strong strategic value to FAO. The successes achieved by several
projects have led to an increase in the number of requests for technical support
from FAO. The FMM projects have also catalyzed substantial amounts of
financial resources through development of follow-up projects. Some resource
partners have already renewed their commitments in the new phase of FMM.
These include the governments of Belgium (2017–2020), Italy (2019), Sweden
(2018–2021) and Switzerland (2018–2019). Other resource partners are also
preparing or negotiating their new commitments.

315.	

There is also clear evidence of catalytic effects of FMM and the report
has highlighted the key principles of FMM, such as capacity development,
partnership, policy support, gender and women empowerment, innovation
and sustainability. Lessons learnt and technical and operational challenges
encountered in the implementation of the various projects have helped the
FMM to evolve over time and continually improve. As a result, the financial
architecture and governance arrangement and operational modalities of the
FMM have been redesigned and transformed into a new funding model that can
mobilize a greater volume of resources.

Acknowledgements
316.	

First of all, FAO is grateful to our esteemed resource partners, including the
Governments of the Belgium, the Netherlands and Sweden, as well as Flanders
(region of Belgium) and Switzerland for the financial support and generous
contributions to the FMM. We would like to thank especially the Ambassadors
and Permanent Representatives of these countries to FAO, and their designate
officials for FMM, for their continued support, in particular for the timely and
constructive inputs in 2018 that have contributed to streamlining the new phase
of FMM.

317.	

The conceptualization and production of this narrative report was led by Festus
Akinnifesi, FMM Coordinator, with oversight support by Gustavo Gonzalez,
Director, Business Development and Resource Mobilization Division (PSR). The
technical production of the report would not have been possible without the
hard work by Sileshi G Weldesemayat, Consultant, who prepared the report.
Lars Thomann is also thanked for his compilation of the individual reports and
relevant materials, and for providing additional technical edit to the report.

318.	

The report also benefitted from various useful resources, including individual
preparation of initial project reports, success stories, and knowledge products
and publications by the Strategic Programmes (SP1, 2, 3 and 4) and the Project
Implementers (including technical divisions, regions and countries) for each of
the FMM-funded projects. Appreciation goes to all the project implementers for
their diligent execution of the projects, including contributing to the reports,
stories and knowledge products generated through FMM. Without all these
above-mentioned resources and contributions from all these various individuals,
especially the project managers and implementers, the report would not have
been possible.

PROJECT RESULTS
GLOBAL
•	

Updated series of the Prevalence of Undernourishment (PoU) (SDG indicator 2.1.1) and the “Prevalence of Severe
Food Insecurity” based on the Food Insecurity Experience Scale (FIES), at country, regional and global levels were
disseminated through FAOSTAT and FAO’s flagship publication ‘The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World
2018’. The report was launched in September 2018 but a substantial part of the work contributing to SOFI 2018 was
elaborated between January and May 2018, and produced jointly with IFAD, UNICEF, WFP and WHO. The prevalence of
severe food insecurity for the years 2014–2015–2016 was published for sub-regions of the world and in 75 countries
that approved dissemination of results for their countries following a consultation process with National Statistical
Offices of UN member nations, carried out during the first half of 2018.

•	

An e-learning course on SDG indicator 2.1.2 (Prevalence of Moderate or Severe Food Insecurity based on FIES) was
finalized in December 2017 and launched in early 2018. Composed of five lessons covering adaptation and inclusion
of the FIES in national surveys, data analysis and communication of results, it will be a welcome tool to help respond
to the burgeoning number of requests from countries for capacity development on the FIES methodology. The
development of an e-learning course on SDG indicator 2.1.1 (PoU) was also launched in early 2018. User-friendly tools
have been developed to assist countries in estimating SDG indicators 2.1.1 and 2.1.2.

•	

In 2018, seventeen regional, sub-regional and national workshops or exploratory technical missions have also been
conducted.

POLICY ADVICE

•	

By explaining the added value and relevance of the information produced using the FIES and PoU methodologies, the
groundwork was laid for uptake of the information for food security policy.

CATALYTIC EFFECTS

•	

FMM support continued to build synergies with other agencies engaged in food security monitoring

CROSS-SECTORAL WORK

•	

Integrated analysis of food security and nutrition indicators in collaboration with FAO’s Nutrition and Food Systems
Division (ESN), its Agricultural Development Economics Division (ESA), WHO and UNICEF in the context of the SOFI
publication promoted bridges across the health and nutrition, food security, agriculture and social protection sectors.

•	

National and regional capacity development activities have promoted a cross-sectoral vision among FAO DOs and
national governments related to food security monitoring.

•	

The FIES and PoU methodologies are technically challenging for many statistics professionals to learn, wherefore
follow-up, remote assistance and good training materials are essential.

•	

Access to household survey data is still restricted in some countries, which has some impact on the efficiency of the
technical support.

COUNTRIES:
South Africa, United Republic of Tanzania and Uganda)

PROJECT RESULTS
Output 1. Capacity building tools on the use of VGGT tailored to CSO and grassroots organizations available

•	

Many of the activities were finalized in 2017. As indicated in the previous reporting, the e-learning was designed
with the mobile accessibility feature in mind, therefore making a separate mobile application designed simply for
communication/feedback purposes unnecessary.

•	

In terms of creating one Community of Practice for trained facilitators, ensuring the development of an online
repository of key materials as well as a user- and mobile-friendly e-learning course more closely met the needs of the
partners.

•	

An analysis of the possible outreach of the webinars suggested to focus on different and more effective disseminating
activities that could at the same time guarantee a multiplier effect in terms of replicating and scaling up the use of the
LG.

•	

In terms of disseminating the learning guide and information, a handout was printed in 2018. The capacity
development material was also shared with the Bringing Organizations & Network Development, Oxfam Novib in
Chad, the Comité Permanent Inter-Etats de Lutte contre la Sécheresse dans le Sahel, the European Union Land Governance
Programme, the Responsible Investment in Agriculture and Food Systems (RAI) team at FAO headquarters, the Forest
and Farm Facility (FFF), participants of the VGGT/SSF Stocktaking Meeting, and the Association of the Governance of
Land, Water and Natural Resources (AGTER).

Output 2. Enhanced capacity of CSOs and grassroots organizations on the use of the VGGT

•	

In West Africa, the project activities implemented at regional level in West Africa in 2016 led to additional funds from
the FAO regular programme (USD 170 000) to be mobilized in order to continue in 2018 to support policy dialogue
related to the governance of tenure of natural resources between CSOs and the regional institutions. Specifically,
four Training-of-Trainers (ToT) activities were carried out in four countries, including the Niger and Nigeria, and one
regional dialogue in West Africa was implemented involving CSOs and ECOWAS representatives. In Asia, Village Focus
International (VFI) from the Lao People’s Democratic Republic, carried out a presentation on the VGGT to the Lao
Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade CSO network.

In Central Asia, a sub-regional workshop for CSOs was organized to further develop the capacity of CSOs and
grassroots organizations on VGGT and to intensify and foster VGGT dissemination and exchange of experiences
of CSOs in the sub-region. In order to strengthen synergies among various ongoing VGGT-related activities in the
region (for example the FAO Regional Office for Europe and Central Asia (REU) Multi-disciplinary Fund (MDF) Project
“Awareness raising and implementation in Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan”; the reform of farm land regulation in the
European Union ‘State of play of farmland concentration in the European Union: how to facilitate the access to land
for farmers’ approved by the European Parliament in April 2017, forwarded to the European Union Commission)
the sub-regional workshop, its agenda and the workshop methodology, were prepared in a collaborative manner
between FAO headquarters, REU, the First Information and Action Network (FIAN) and representatives of the CSO
Facilitation Committee (the group of regional CSOs facilitating the dialogue between FAO and CSOs in the region of
Europe and Central Asia, including small-scale food producer organizations and NGOs). The workshop was held in
2018 in Kyrgyzstan with FAO Regular Programme Funds. A total of 48 CSO representatives from Armenia, Kazakhstan,
Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia, Tajikistan, Turkey, Turkmenistan, Ukraine and Uzbekistan participated. One of the strongest
requests from the participants was related to the translation of the LG into Russian. This activity was implemented in
close collaboration with the REU office team working on land tenure. The workshop also resulted in the development
of a sub-regional platform of CSOs willing to continue working together on tenure-related issues. Funds from the FAO
regular programme were secured at the end of 2018 to carry out the translation in 2019.

•	

At the global level, the approach developed under the FMM was incorporated into several FAO programme activities,
such as the second phase of the VGGT Umbrella Programme and the Umbrella Programme for the Promotion and
Application of the SSF Guidelines.

•	

In Kyrgyzstan, capacity building was carried out by the Nomadic Livestock Keepers’ Development Public Fund (NLKDF).
To pilot the adapted version of the LG to the pastoralist context, FAO regular funds (USD 35 000) were secured at the
end of 2018, and ToT will be carried out in 2019.

•	

In Mongolia, additional funds (FAO regular budget in the amount of USD 60 000) were secured in order for PCC to
adapt the LG to the pastoralist context and carry out four ToT activities at local level to test and finalize the guide in
2018. The ToT had 133 participants from four regions. In addition, requests were made for simplified material related
to pastoralism. FAO regular budget in the amount of USD 20 000 were secured at the end of 2018 to produce this
material in 2019.

•	

In Nepal, FIAN Nepal was contracted in November 2018 by the Self-Employment Women’s Association (SEWA) to
lead a five-day VGGT capacity development workshop for approximately 20 women community-forestry users. This
activity was implemented in partnership with FOA’s Forest and Farm Facility project and their Nepalese partner, the
Federation of Community Forestry Users Nepal.

•	

In Sierra Leone, the Organization Culture Radio FM104.5 produced and broadcast four one-hour radio programmes
on: (i) Understanding the New Land Policy of Sierra Leone; (ii) Registration-Land Right Recording and the VGGT; (iii)
Land Use Planning and the VGGT; and (iv) Women’s Land Rights and the VGGT in 2017. Culture Radio also produced a
15-minute documentary on the VGGT and the New Land Policy for two television stations. The documentary and the
radio programmes were broadcasted in 2018. The radio programmes and documentary reached an estimated 2.5–3
million people.

•	

In Colombia, FAO has played an important role in supporting the Government in the implementation of
comprehensive rural development policies. Based on the FMM project results achieved in 2016 with the Federación
Nacional Unitaria Agropecuaria (FENSUAGRO) the FMM project provided in 2017 technical assistance to the FAO
Country Office for planning capacity development activities for grassroots and CSOs, including indigenous and
afro-descendent member organizations of FENSUAGRO and public officials in Colombia who are working on local
ownership and contextualization of the VGGT. Due to the various complex and lengthy processes at country level and
the yearly-cycle duration of the FMM project, and in order to ensure the implementation of the planned activities,
additional funding (FAO regular budget in the amount of USD 42 000) was secured for conducting ToT activities and
sensitization workshops. In January 2018, one ToT was carried out on the VGGT in Viotá – Cundinamarca with the
participation of 25 representatives of social organizations. One sensitization workshop with government entities on
the opportunities of the VGGT for institutional management in the context of conflicts over land use and tenure rights
was also held in Bogotá, with 25 participants. One sensitization workshop was held in February 2018 for communities
and CSOs representatives in El Cocuy (Boyacá) and La Paya (Putumayo) national parks. This involved 40 participants.

Output 3. Knowledge on experiences and lessons learnt to increase the use of the VGGT by CSOs available and
disseminated

•	

The document Capitalization on activities conducted under the Belgium project 1st phase was finalized. The Case
Study Template was also finalized.

•	

17 country factsheets were published online in Colombia, Côte D’Ivoire, Guatemala, Guinea, Indonesia, Kyrgyzstan,
Liberia, Malawi, Mali, Mauritania, Mongolia, Myanmar, Nepal, the Niger, the Philippines, Senegal, Sierra Leone, South
Africa and Uganda. These factsheets provide background information focusing on the activities undertaken in the
country, and more importantly the impact of these activities on the overall national processes for tenure security, as
well as links to other important initiatives taking place in the country on VGGT and tenure issues in general. In those
countries with strong success stories, it was ensured that this information was also highlighted in a dedicated session.

•	

The following were achieved in supporting national multi-stakeholder platforms.
	 In Mali, FMM in support of CSO and multi-actor initiatives proved successful in ensuring VGGT-guided inputs
to national debates on the implementation of the newly promulgated Agricultural Land Law that introduced
innovations clearly inspired by VGGT principles and also for the current National Land Reform process. The FMM
project activities carried out in Mali in 2017 led to additional funds from the FAO regular programme (USD 75
000) for continued support to country-level activities in 2018. In particular the activities of the working group of
the multi-actors platforms focused on implementing decrees on the land commissions at village level that had
been adopted by the Cabinet on 14 March 2018.
	 In Mongolia, FMM technical and financial support was provided in 2017 to the multi-stakeholder platform as well
as the VGGT working group, related to the implementation and mainstreaming of the VGGT. Specifically, PCC
facilitated the working-group functioning and identified their needs and requests in order to mainstream the
VGGT in the country. A three-day multi-stakeholder workshop was carried out in April 2018, with funding from
the FAO regular budget (in the amount of USD 30 000), to increase the multi-stakeholder platform engagement.
The meeting had 53 participants from the national and local government, CSOs, research institutes, international
organizations, projects and the private sector.
	 In Colombia, funds were secured for a two-year project funded by Italy (GCP/GLO/347/MUL) to conduct ToT
activities for CSOs and share experiences in order to improve local-level land governance processes for planning
and enhance CSO knowledge and engagement in the national ongoing national-level tenure processes.

CONTRIBUTION TO FAO RESULTS

•	

FAO validated corporate results for 2018 are being evaluated.

FMM GENERAL PRINCIPLES AND EFFECTS
PARTNERSHIPS

•	

Throughout 2018, partnerships with CSOs continued. Partnerships reported in the 2014–2017 mid-term final report
were also maintained.

CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT

•	

In 2018, with additional funding, around 243 people were trained at country level and 53 were directly sensitized to
VGGT through the regional activities. Sensitization was also carried out through radio programmes, advertisements,
etc. Participants were either all CSO members or a blended audience of CSO members and government staff.

•	

Through the training, the capacities gained included (i) knowledge of the VGGT; (ii) use of the VGGT to analyze
systematically cases where governance of tenure can be improved; (iii) to plan activities to support the VGGT
implementation; (iv) to network on governance of tenure issues; (v) to strengthen the participation of CSOs in the
multi-stakeholder platforms for the discussion/design/improvement of tenure-related legal and policy frameworks;
and (vi) the capacity to improve legal and policy frameworks. The workshop participants were able to link the tenure
rights in their work and design action plans, to document local-level cases and to identify VGGT-related tenure issues
in their work and raise them with concerned government agencies.

Flexible Multi-Partner Mechanism Annual Report 2018

-----------------------Page 83 End-----------------------

POLICY ADVICE

•	

The enhanced capacities of CSOs in relation to the VGGT led to a dialogue where the VGGT served as a reference
tool at the multi-stakeholder level (notably when drafting tenure policies or legislation). Moreover, the methodology
adopted in the training placed an emphasis on the understanding of national processes and the capacity to plan
activities for CSOs to engage with.

CATALYTIC EFFECTS

•	

The successful implementation of the first two phases of the project attracted external funding for activities at country
level. Some of the activities in Colombia, Kyrgyzstan and Mongolia were funded by the FAO regular budget (USD 110
000), with the provision of technical assistance under the FMM to be carried out in 2018. Additional funds (FAO regular
budget in the amount of USD 55 000) were also secured at the end of 2018 to carry out activities in 2019.

CROSS-SECTORAL WORK

•	

The VGGT addressed land, fisheries and forest governance, and tenure issues. In 2018, the project continued its
collaboration with FAO land tenure officers (at headquarters and regional level) and partnership officers (at regional
level). Collaboration with the DPS Capacity Development Team was key for the development of the e-learning course.
Collaboration with the Fisheries and Aquaculture Department was also instrumental for the adaptation of the
Learning Guide for VGGT/SSF Voluntary Guidelines. Finally, Regional and Sub-regional Offices (REU and RAF) were
closely involved in the design, organization and implementation of the regional workshops, as well as activities at
country level.

GENDER

•	

The gender dimension is a cross-cutting area within the VGGT. In this project it was concretely mainstreamed by
(i) encouraging gender-balanced representation during the training organized by local partners; (ii) presenting
the principles of the VGGT (including gender equity); (iii) triggering analysis on the relevance of gender equity on
governance of tenure. The efforts have been constant to encourage higher participation of women in the training and
more active participation. In the follow-up activities (funded by the FAO regular programme), the latter was always
ensured through gender-sensitive participatory processes.

PROJECT RESULTS
During the no-cost extension in 2018, work focused on national, regional and global-level follow-up of activities.
•	 The reference/guidance document on “Transforming food and agriculture to achieve the SDGs: 20 interconnected actions
to guide decision-makers” was finalized. Presented in the context of the Council, COFI, COFO and COAG, this reinforced
a common approach to integrated policy support, capacity buildin and strengthened collaborative partnerships to
mainstreaming sustainable food and agriculture in SDGimplementation at country level. It also underpinned FAO’s
support to the UN High-Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development 2018.

•	

The development of the book “Sustainable Food and Agriculture: An Integrated Approach” was finalized. The book, for
which analysis was supported by FMM under the output on regional/global knowledge sharing and learning, draws
upon leading experts from various disciplines to provide a comprehensive overview of the state-of-the-art thinking on
and proposals for sustainable food and agriculture.

Output 3

•	

The FMM provided support to the global event on “Partnering and networking: 2nd International Symposium on
Agroecology: Scaling up Agroecology to Achieve the SDGs”. A record 768 participants, including representatives from
72 governments, 350 non-state actors and representatives of six UN organizations attended the event. FAO presented
the ten elements of agroecology as a guide to transitioning to sustainable agriculture and food systems. UN partners
jointly launched the Scaling Up Agroecology Initiative, to be implemented with multi-stakeholder partners over the
next ten years. In preparation for the Symposium, FAO conducted an analysis of its work plan and projects. The
analysis showed that eight percent of FAO’s results planned for 2018–2019 are directly contributing to agro-ecological
transitions at one or multiple levels. Even more significantly, a further 47 percent of FAO’s work could be shaped or
modified in some way to contribute directly to scaling up agroecology.

CONTRIBUTION TO FAO RESULTS

•	

FAO results on the FMM were reported by Bangladesh, Morocco and Rwanda. In addition, results were reported for
each of the 2018 Outputs listed above. The FMM Baby02 project thus contributed to results at country, regional and
global levels.

FMM GENERAL PRINCIPLES AND EFFECTS
PARTNERSHIPS

•	

Based on the work of FMM at country level, follow-up work at that level is now under way to build national and
sub-national partnerships around private-sector and civil-society mobilization, and involvement in implementing
sustainable food and agriculture in the context of SDG implementation. The approach developed in the context of
the FMM follow-up in Bangladesh has now been scaled up in 2018 in several other countries, with further scaling-up
planned for 2019.

CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT

•	

Based on the work of FMM at country level and guidance developed at the global level, follow-up capacity
development projects are under way in selected countries for the integration of sustainable food and agriculture at
programme level in the context of SDG implementation, for example through follow-up projects in Bangladesh.

POLICY ADVICE

•	

The FMM has allowed to scale up FAO’s support to countries on sustainable food and agriculture at programme level
in the context of SDG implementation.

CATALYTIC EFFECTS

•	

The FMM allowed to develop the five principles of sustainable food and agriculture, endorsed by FAO Member States.
It also enabled FAO to develop a coherent, integrated approach across FAO’s technical units and sectors. At COAG
2018, member states requested FAO to continue its support to countries in mainstreaming sustainable food and
agriculture in the 2030 Agenda in an integrated way.

CROSS-SECTORAL WORK

•	

The guidance on sustainable food and agriculture is particularly geared towards integrated, cross-sectoral and
coherent approaches to food and agriculture.

GENDER

•	

Gender is an explicit component of the 20 interconnected actions to guide decision makers on sustainable food and
agriculture.

INNOVATION

•	

The main innovation of the FMM project is the integrated, cross-sectoral coherent approach to sustainable food and
agriculture, which supports a transformation of food and agricultural systems towards sustainability considering all
main dimensions of sustainability, operationalizing the intentions of the SDGs in the food and agricultural sectors.

CHALLENGES IN PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND LESSONS LEARNED
Challenges

•	

In 2018, there was no major challenge to overcome in project implementation other than the realization that issues
of sustainability in agriculture are not new, while a comprehensive, integrated approach to sustainability is both novel
and challenging. Identifying the right timing and scale of project implementation at country level was important for
success. This partly depended on political will and using opportunities, such as the national SDG implementation
processes.

Lessons learned

•	

69

Implementation of SFA can be initiated more easily at sub-national level around already-identified issues of
sustainability and a clear willingness by the local authority to address it.

CATALYTIC EFFECTS

•	

The project helped the mobilization of additional financial resources with: (i) a project Agreement signed with France
in January 2018, and (ii) key support of the Lead Technical Officer and consultants hired for the preparation of The
Restoration Initiative (TRI) thematic programme launched during the first semester of 2018, and for the final phase
of clearance of the proposal by IKI. Additional resource mobilization efforts were planned for 2018, in particular to
prepare the ground for potential GEF-7 projects (Guinea and Madagascar) and the Green Climate Fund (GCF) (Uganda).

•	

The national Work Plans in Cambodia, Lebanon and the Philippines are also linked with Technical Cooperation Projects
funded by the FAO regular budget, and the catalytic effect of this project was key for mobilization of those financial
resources.

•	

The national Work Plans also had a component focused on financial resource mobilization for national FLR initiatives.
These funds are focused on the mobilization of (i) the Diaspora and the operationalization of the National Forest Fund
in Lebanon, (ii) the private sector (CSR platform in Lebanon and Impact Funds in Rwanda) and (iii) climate finance
(Green Climate Fund in Cambodia and the Philippines).

CROSS-SECTORAL WORK

•	

All the work plans approved in Cambodia, Guatemala, Lebanon, Peru, the Philippines and Rwanda were focused on
cross-sectoral issues for the implementation of National Forest and Landscape Restoration (FLR) Action Plans or Large
Scale FLR programmes.

•	

The project was an excellent opportunity to develop collaboration with other FAO Departments in particular on: (i)
assessment of degraded lands, (ii) monitoring of FLR efforts, (iii) Sustainable financing for FLR and preparation of
several project proposals (GEF, FFEM and IKI, among others).

GENDER

•	

The platforms supported at national level for improving the multi-stakeholders dialogue ensured that rural women
and men have the ability to influence programmes and policy decision-making on the use of key natural resources
and can take up economic opportunities to improve their individual and household well-being. The workshops and
capacity-building sessions and side events organized with the funding from this project took into consideration
the gender balance for both the panelists and the participants funded by the Swedish International Development
Cooperation Agency (SIDA).

INNOVATION

•	

The project implemented innovative approaches in planning FLR options at the local or decentralized level within each
selected country, promotion of assisted natural regeneration and use of innovative FLR technics. Innovations were
also promoted in terms of sustainable financing for Forest and Landscape Restoration with efforts on the mobilization
of the private sector (for example Corporate Social Responsibility, Impact Funds or diasporas) and innovative financial
instruments, and through partnerships with business catalysts and incubators.

CHALLENGES IN PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND LESSONS LEARNED
Challenges

•	

The extension of both the duration (and the total budget) of this project to the end of May 2018 was not sufficient to
achieve all the actions of the FLR work plans, and several work plans are now funded by other sources in 2018–2019.

•	

The amount available per country was too small and obliged the FLRM team to develop partnerships and strategic
alliances with other partners to be credible at the national level. The funds available for each country do not allow
developing large-scale restoration efforts on the ground in the selected pilot areas, which is a strong request from
government counterparts in all beneficiary countries.

Lessons learned

75

•	

Stakeholders acknowledge the value of regional collaboration and exchange as a good way to transfer knowledge,
sensitize policymakers and mutualize tools and approaches. These multi-country dynamics, which started in the
Mediterranean and Asia–Pacific regions under leadership of the FLRM, are promising. However, it requires significant
investments, both in terms of time and financial resources to facilitate these multi-country processes.

•	

The flexibility of the FMM funding and its wide geographical scope were greatly appreciated, as they allow to leverage
additional funding from other sources through innovative arrangements.

OUTPUTS

PROJECT DATES

•	

Global: Coordinated the development of a globally applicable approach and methodology for
an agricultural component to NAPs;

•	

Regional: Supported FAO regional climate change officers to provide technical support and
link country’s efforts in regional initiatives; and

•	

Country support provided to the focus country Malawi.

1 August 2014–31 May 2018

IMPLEMENTATION
Malawi and Uganda
COUNTRIES:

PROJECT RESULTS
Output 1: Global: Coordination of the development of a globally applicable approach and methodology for an
agricultural component to NAPs;

•	

In 2018, this FMM project contributed to the development of global knowledge products on climate-change adaptation
in agriculture. It also contributed significantly to the final documents Addressing agriculture, forestry and fisheries in
National Adaptation Plans (NAP-Ag) Supplementary Guidelines; and developed, launched and provided user guidance
for the Knowledge tank for agriculture sectors’ adaptation to climate change, now containing over 140 categorized
information materials.

•	

In 2018, lessons learned from the original FMM project gave rise to the development of a new FMM project, titled:
“Integrated NDC-SDG implementation country support: Leveraging climate action and sustainable development through lowemissions and climate-resilient food and agriculture systems”. Additional detail is provided below.

Output 2: Regional: Support FAO regional climate change officers to provide technical backstopping and link
country efforts in regional initiatives;

•	

No further regional activities were specifically undertaken in 2018 by the FMM project, though the global knowledge
products produced can be said to have benefited regional-level exchanges and training efforts in 2018 as well.

Output 3: Country support provided to the focus country Malawi; initial support activities are initiated in Uganda

•	

Activities in Malawi were wrapped up with the development of a case study, entitled “Strengthening capacities for
climate change impact assessment and modelling on the agricultural sectors: Applying MOSAICC methodology for national
adaptation planning in Malawi”. This case study draws lessons from the technical capacity development activities
implemented in 2014–2017. The case study will be formally launched in 2019, and provides a bridge with the NAPAg case study series (the USD-17-million NAP-Ag programme – UNFA/GLO/616/UND – funded by Germany under IKI
initiative and jointly implemented by FAO and UNDP, building on the seed funding and early lessons learned provided
by this project).

•	

With support from the FMM programme, and the larger NAP-Ag programme, Uganda successfully launched its
first-ever National Adaptation Plan for the Agriculture Sector in Kampala on 28 November 2018. The Uganda NAPAg framework presents 21 priority adaptation options in the key areas of: Crop Production; Livestock Production;
Fisheries Management; Climate Information, Early Warning and Disaster Preparedness; Forestry, Land and Natural
Resources Management; and Research and Knowledge Management. The agriculture NAP strongly links to
Government commitments under the Paris Agreement on Climate Change and the Sustainable Development Goals
(SDGs).
Flexible Multi-Partner Mechanism Annual Report 2018

-----------------------Page 95 End-----------------------

CONTRIBUTION TO FAO RESULTS

•	

The National Adaptation Plans (NAPs) process resulted in a mapping of existing vulnerability assessments, adaptation
policy measures and institutional capacities; and in the alignment of the ministry of agriculture with the national crosssectoral NAPs core team.

RESULTS / FMM GENERAL PRINCIPLES AND EFFECTS
PARTNERSHIPS

•	

In Malawi, partnerships were fostered across the Ministry of Agriculture, Irrigation and Water Development,
Department of Climate Change and Meteorological Services and Lilongwe University of Agriculture and Natural
Resources.

•	

In Uganda, the NAP-Ag development process was supported by FAO, UNDP, the Ugandan Ministry of Agriculture,
Animal Industries and Fisheries and the Climate Change Department of the Ministry of Water and Environment, which
is the Focal Point for the United Nations Framework Convention for Climate Change. Multi-stakeholder consultations
among relevant and key partners, including local and central governments, the private sector, academia and other
non-state actors, on climate change challenges in the agricultural sector were conducted.

CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT
•	 In 2018, the FMM project did not conduct any further capacity development activities.
POLICY ADVICE
•	 National-level policy work and outcomes undertaken in Malawi (National Agriculture Policy, NAIP) and Uganda
(Agriculture-Sector NAP) were completed.
CATALYTIC EFFECTS

•	

The inventory of 500 FAO knowledge products on climate-change action in the agricultural sector undertaken as part
of this FMM project now serves as the basis for a public platform known as the “Climate and Land Hub (CL-Hub)”, a
beta version of which has now been launched, drawing on further funding both from the Government of Germany
and SP2. The CL-Hub presents a one-stop shop for guidance and tools for planners, policymakers and climate change
negotiators working on scaling up climate action in the agricultural sector.

•	

An additional USD 5 million has been made available from the Provincial Government of Quebec, Canada, to work
on climate change adaptation in Haiti and Senegal through the project “Strengthening National Adaptation Planning
capacities for Food Security and Nutrition” (GCP /GLO/921/GQC).

CROSS-SECTORAL WORK

•	

A multi-stakeholder process on National Adaptation Plans (NAPs) was facilitated, with cross-sectoral dialogues
established between ministries of agriculture, environment and planning, and UNDP and FAO to support the
integration of agricultural sectors into NAPs. The project has specifically fostered cross-sectoral work across the fields
of agriculture, meteorology, environment, climate change adaptation, mitigation and disaster risk reduction, as well as
gender.

GENDER

•	

Under the auspices of the NAP-Ag programme, which builds on the work of this FMM project, a case study titled
Gender and adaptation planning in the agricultural sectors: The case of Uganda was launched in early 2018.

INNOVATION

79

•	

The project remains innovative in its approach of bringing national actors from different line ministries (including
agriculture, fisheries, forestry, environment, development planning, meteorology and gender) into dialogue and
stimulating previously separate national policy processes to cross-fertilize more.

•	

Another example of innovation is the national coordination on NAPs, NDCs and SDGs. This original FMM proposal
allowed for the development of a new FMM project proposal titled “Integrated NDC-SDG implementation country support:
Leveraging climate action and sustainable development through low-emissions and climate-resilient food and agriculture
systems”, targeting USD 6 million over four years.

Annexes

-----------------------Page 96 End-----------------------

CHALLENGES IN PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND LESSONS LEARNED
Challenges

•	

Coordination challenges around the multiple ongoing climate and development planning processes, in particular
related to NAPs, SDGs and NDCs. The NDCs and SDGs agendas were generally defined and advanced separately
or under distinct national coordination frameworks and led by different institutions. As a result of this separation
between planning and implementation tracks, there are relatively limited alignment and synergies between the
specific climate actions supporting the NDCs and the national sustainable development targets underpinning the
SDGs, often leading to duplications and separation of information, capacity, and policymaking in silos.

•	

The challenges of NDC implementation are particularly pronounced in the agriculture sectors. Countries face three
main challenges when moving from NDC planning to implementation: (i) lack of available data and evidence to support
informed decision-making; (ii) weak institutional capacity to integrate climate and agriculture priorities within national
policy frameworks and budgeting processes; and (iii) limited technical capacity to identify and prioritize climate
mitigation and adaptation options and to monitor the progress of their implementation.

•	

Similarly, the country-driven approach of the 2030 Agenda presents new planning and monitoring challenges in the
agriculture sectors when national and sub-national information systems and approaches are not harmonized and
human and technical resources are limited to handle the weight of 230 indicators, disaggregated by income, sex, age,
race, ethnicity, migratory status, disability and geographic location.

Lessons learned

•	

Supporting countries on NAPs has been instrumental in defining and outlining how FAO can support countries on
medium to long-term policy, adaptation planning and budgetary aspects.

COUNTRIES:

PROJECT RESULTS
In 2018, the project focused mainly on wrapping up the activities, disseminating results and finalizing the analyses that
were not completed in 2017.

•	

Two analyses of the potentials for improving productivity, resilience and mitigation for livestock production
intensification options were conducted. Field trials on crop–livestock integration with the University of Zambia were
carried out for a second season in 2018. The trials were meant to provide evidence on synergies between crops and
livestock and how to avoid competition for the use of crop residues while improving the use of manure as fertilizer. In
addition, a joint analysis of seasonality patterns in forages in Zambia and Western Africa was conducted to improve
the representativeness of the assessments obtained with the Global Livestock Environmental Assessment Model
(GLEAM). This feeds into the joint AGA–CBC analysis of climate impact on pastures and livestock.

•	

Analysis of climate variability and impact of climate change on agriculture using MOSAICC was also conducted. In
Malawi, a half-day technical workshop was held to share with national stakeholders the results of future climate and
crop yield. In Zambia, support was provided to the national climate and crop team (University of Zambia, Mulungushi
University, Zambia Meteorological Department and Zambian Ministry of Agriculture) to complete the analysis and to
advance the writing of the technical report on crop-yield projection under future climate. The team consolidated the
crop-production data for all crops and completed the analysis of the historical yield trend.

Annexes

-----------------------Page 100 End-----------------------

CATALYTIC EFFECTS

•	

Technical Inter-Agency Committee for Drought Risk Management coordinated by COPECO to develop technical
proposals for the dry-corridor territories affected by drought. This Committee involved more than 15 institutions.

CROSS-SECTORAL WORK

•	

The project worked closely with landowners, livestock platforms, and educational institutions such as the Ministry of
Agriculture Service for Agricultural Training and Agribusiness Development.

GENDER

•	

Around 70 percent of project beneficiaries are women.

INNOVATION

•	
•	

The focus on scaling up silvo-pastoral systems with livestock platforms and educational institutions is one-off.
All the technologies promoted through the project are innovative for the area of intervention, especially water-harvest
systems and eco-stoves. All the technologies and practices implemented and evaluated through the project were
identified with a participatory approach by local producers and technicians, unprecedented in the field of agroforestry.

CHALLENGES IN PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND LESSONS LEARNED
Challenges

•	

The implementation of agroforestry systems is a long process that demands a high cost and often conflicts with the
little land that families possess, and with their needs for food and income.

Lessons learned

•	

Agroforestry systems are well accepted by farmers and the local authorities but should be implemented taking into
account the availability of land for families and the immediate needs for food and income.

•	

In the dry corridor of water-harvesting technologies are well accepted by the population and the local authorities and
should become the central link in the technological package.

•	

From the start projects should be implemented in coordination with the municipalities to ensure sustainability.

programmes that generate decent rural employment (DRE) with particular focus on fostering
youth and rural women’s economic and social empowerment”

1 June 2015–31 May 2018

IMPLEMENTATION
Global, regional (RAF and RLC) and country level (Guatemala, Senegal and Uganda).
COUNTRIES:

PROJECT RESULTS
The majority of the activities were carried out in 2017, but activities continued and products were finalized and
disseminated in 2018. Only the key results achieved in 2018 are summarized below:
Guatemala

•	

Following the launch of the rural-friendly window model, 500 youth benefited from access to agriculture support
services and entrepreneurship opportunities. Of these, 20 percent accessed labour orientation or direct training
support, 50 percent external training offered by partners, 5 percent found a job and 14 percent are receiving technical
support to start or strengthen their business.

•	

Following the launch of ChispaRural.gt, a virtual hub where rural youth can access up-to-date information on
opportunities and resources offered by different suppliers, as well as practical tools and inspirational stories of young
agripreneurs, the project continued testing the service that responds to the needs reported by more than 1 500 young
people and rural service providers in the department of San Marcos.

•	

Factoria del emprendimiento, a business laboratory helping youth start up community-centered small and medium
enterprises was launched with a territorial development approach. The initiative provided a three-month training on
entrepreneurial skills and local development to 75 young men and women, between 20 and 30 years of age, from the
migration-prone departments of Quetzaltenango, San Marcos, Huehuetenango and Totonicapán. The Factoria also
supported the youth in assessing local markets, defining alliances and formulating financially-viable project proposals.
All projects show a strong agriculture and livestock base and explore the potential of niche markets and green
entrepreneurship. Each of the youth-led enterprises engages 50 to 100 families from the respective communities.

Senegal

•	

85

The project continued supporting the MIJA platforms, small rural hubs for proximity agribusiness support, where rural
youth learn about agricultural production, aggregation, transformation and service provision. A dedicated training
package on rural entrepreneurship was developed and used in the six platforms. The package includes tools for the
development of business plans and guidance on rural entrepreneurship. As a result, 60 young agripreneurs learnt
how to enhance their businesses, while another 90 youth were trained in agricultural production, using the Farmer
Field Schools (FFS) approach.. The MIJA initiative ensured guidance and support not only to the young women and men
participating in the platforms, but also to other youths in neighbouring areas. Overall, the 6 MIJA pilots are expected to
generate 1 500 direct and indirect on-farm and off-farm jobs and to positively impact the livelihoods of 12 800

Annexes

-----------------------Page 102 End-----------------------

households. The FAO MIJA model has generated growing interest in Senegal as an effective approach to supporting
the engagement of rural youth in agribusiness. Senegal’s ANPEJ has already committed more than USD 500 000 for the
infrastructure work needed to maintain and strengthen the platforms, guaranteeing the long-term sustainability of the
initiative.

•	

The online web- and mobile-based National Observatory of Rural Employment, a dynamic online hub launched in
2017 as a platform for rural youth, producers and development partners, has been tailored to the local contexts,
with a particular emphasis on the needs of young, self-employed entrepreneurs, taking into account the distribution
of languages in the country and the national literacy rate. In order to develop the observatory, a partnership was
established with the local youth-led organization Yeesal AgriHub, which developed the online platform and keeps it
updated with information and agricultural data. Yeesal AgriHub is also in charge of promoting the platform within
online networks and media channels, in order to reach out to the final audience and make the Observatory effective
and useful for youth.

Uganda

•	

The project continued supporting the implementation of the five-year Strategy for Youth in Agriculture, developed by
ICA with the Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Industries and Fisheries, with the aim of re-engaging youth in agriculture
and creating more and better jobs along agricultural value chains, from production to agro-processing and marketing
of agricultural inputs and products. Specific activities included trainings of youth in farming as a business and the
identification of rural youth champions who can act as role models for their peers. Overall, the Strategy aims at
strengthening the legal and institutional framework for youth employment in agriculture, ensuring provision of
youth-sensitive agricultural extension services and creating national information centers that will serve as innovation
hubs. It also promotes safety and health standards at work and the utilization of funds targeting youth for enterprise
development.

•	

A study focusing on rural youth between 15 and 17 years of age was carried out in order to shed light on the
education level and employment status of an age group which is neglected in many policy interventions. The study
revealed that the majority of youth in this age cohort dropped out of school at an early age, most of them before
having finished primary school. Moreover, the majority of them is unemployed or employed in low-pay jobs in the
informal sector. Ninety-six percent of them are contributing family farmers and are involved in agricultural activities,
having, however, limited or no access to decent jobs opportunities. In addition, ICA undertook an analysis of the main
ongoing initiatives aimed at boosting youth employment in agriculture in the country, assessing their strengths and
weaknesses, as well as innovation and replication potential. Both studies resulted in a series of recommendations
towards the replication and scaling-up of successful interventions, which informed and will inform national strategic
discussions on youth engagement in agriculture and food systems.

CONTRIBUTION TO FAO RESULTS

•	

The project contributes to Organizational Output 30201 and to the Sustainable Development Goals, in particular to
Goal 8.

RESULTS / FMM GENERAL PRINCIPLES AND EFFECTS
PARTNERSHIPS
In 2018, the project worked with the following partners and organizations:

•	

The Young Farmers Champions Network in Uganda as a partner in occupational safety and health (OSH) risk
assessments and youth mapping, confirming the project’s interest in prioritizing partnerships with youth
organizations;

•	

The Federación Nacional de Cafeteros de Colombia, engaged in an SSC exchange with Guatemala for the adaptation of
their successful initiative New Coffee Generation, and various national stakeholders from the Guatemala coffee sector
(such as Agexport, Anacafé, the Neumann Foundation, coffee shops and several cooperatives in the western regions);

•	

In Guatemala, the initiative of la Factoria, as a model for social entrepreneurship and territorial development,
generated multiple alliances within the four targeted departments, including with 18 Municipalities, several ministries,
development partners such as GIZ, the Central American Bank for Economic Integration (CABEI) and USAID, research
centers like Flacso, training centers such as INTECAP, universities and multiple NGOs;

Flexible Multi-Partner Mechanism Annual Report 2018

-----------------------Page 103 End-----------------------

•	

Again in Guatemala, the Chisparural platform engages the ministries of agriculture, labour, education and economy,
and their decentralized services, as well as NGOs, development partners such as GIZ and foundations such as
Neumann, as service providers;

•	

In Senegal, collaboration was established with UNIDO and the Technical Centre for Agricultural and Rural Cooperation
(CTA), and among several FAO technical units, to enhance the MIJA platform model in terms of its business approach
and use of ICT;

•	

FAO membership in the International Partnership for Cooperation on Child Labour in Agriculture has supported the
activities at country and global level.

CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT

•	

In Guatemala, FAO organized a ‘Coffee Camp’ in March 2018, which sought to motivate young people from coffeegrowing areas to dedicate themselves to the category of specialty coffee producers. The Coffee Camps are an
integral part of a nine-month special coffee-making process for young people in the coffee-growing areas of the
Huehuetenango area. They are an experiential learning space that seeks to motivate young people to discover
different links in the coffee value chain – adaptation practices to climate change, roasting, tasting, barista, virtual
marketing and customer service.

•	

At the global level, the online DRE toolbox was produced as an online repository for all FAO guidance materials, case
studies and good practices. The DRE Policy database acts as an online repository for DRE policies. The DRE policy
database has been expanded, reaching 1 000 entries.

POLICY ADVICE

•	

Building on the achievements in 2017 and preceding years, the project influenced high-visibility policy processes in
each country, leading to the development of youth-specific policies and strategies, such as the Youth in Agriculture
Strategy in Guatemala or Axis 3 of the National Decent Work Policy in Guatemala and the National Strategy for
Youth Employment in Agriculture in Uganda.

CATALYTIC EFFECTS

•	

As a result of the success of the project, a third phase of the project will be implemented by 2019. The new project
will build on the results achieved in Guatemala, Senegal and Uganda and replicate the experiences in Kenya and
Rwanda. In Senegal, as a result of technical support and active negotiations, the MIJA platforms will likely be adopted
as implementation model for vulnerable youth in the forthcoming national adaptation of the AfDB ENABLE Youth
programme. To streamline this process, a new Technical Cooperation Facility project has been created.

CROSS-SECTORAL WORK

•	

The ICA project continued to support cross-sectoral work at country level, mainly through the technical working
groups and support ecosystems mobilized behind policy processes (like the NSYEA in Uganda) or territorial initiatives
(like the Factoria or the Coffee cluster initiative in Guatemala). Cross-sectoral collaboration among the ministries of
agriculture, labour, economy and social affairs, as well as with planning authorities, territorial and local authorities,
CSOs and youth organizations, has been pursued as a priority. Similarly, within FAO, the project facilitated exchanges
between different technical units, decentralized offices DOs and strategic objective teams on the issue of decent rural
youth employment. Collaboration was strengthened in particular between the Social Policies and Rural Institutions
Division leading the ICA project.

GENDER

•	

87

Gender issues were mainstreamed as cross-cutting topic as integral part of the concept of decent work. Some
examples of concrete efforts include the following: (i) Gender issues were analyzed in dedicated sections of the
assessment developed, and addressed in all policies and supported strategies; (ii) Rural women’s empowerment
in the context of the decent work agenda is one of the seven lessons of the e-learning course on DRE, translated in
French and Spanish in 2017, as well as one of the five modules of the DRE toolbox, and crosscutting dimension in the
youth employment-focused value chain assessment tool developed; (iii) The FAO online policy database contains 47
documents where gender equality is the main policy area, and 238 where rural women are an explicit target group.

Annexes

-----------------------Page 104 End-----------------------

•	

All supported capacity-development and pilot models strive to promote gender equality among beneficiaries. As a
result, 52 percent of the beneficiaries of the Ventanilla Única Municipal de Empleo VUME rural in Guatemala are women,
as well as almost 60 percent of the youth trained in the Factoria; on average 40 to 50 percent of youth beneficiaries
in all interventions implemented in Senegal and Uganda are women. This was achieved by: ensuring the presence of
rural women trainers; promoting young women champions; and solving eventual rural communication and transport
obstacles faced by rural young women (for example, in Guatemala, the VUME operates with two staff, one men and
one woman, who often physically reach rural communities to ensure an increasing outreach of the window services to
young women that cannot easily travel to the municipality). Regarding ICT, the communication diagnostic conducted in
Guatemala revealed only minor gender differences in the access to smartphones and internet connections, confirming
ICT potential for gender-inclusive access to extension and employment services.

INNOVATION
The ICA project contributed to spur innovation in terms of new approaches and methodologies for decent rural youth
employment promotion. In 2018, interesting innovations introduced are:

•	

The development of a tool to conduct youth-employment focused value chain analyses. The tool was developed in
Uganda for the coffee value chain.

•	

The use of ICT for enhancing youth access to extension and employment services in remoted rural areas. Examples
are the Chisparural.GT platform in Guatemala and the National Employment Observatory in Senegal. In addition
to enhancing youth access to information and service providers, the services were designed to also facilitate youth
networking and access to financial opportunities, like crowdfunding platforms.

CHALLENGES IN PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND LESSONS LEARNED
Challenges

•	

No major challenges were identified in 2018, as 90 percent of the project’s activities ended in 2017.

Lessons learned

•	

One of the useful lessons learned is the importance of getting youth beneficiaries on board at the beginning, as
partners, champions and service providers. The innovation potential of direct engagement of the youth is huge,
not only to ensure the sustainability of results, but also to push forward with the modernization of communication
strategies and approaches and tools, with potential extended benefits for the broader FAO work programme;

•	

Another important lesson is FAO’s comparative advantage at country level of the facilitation of a more programmatic
approach for more youth-inclusive food systems. While the topic has become high priority, especially in sub-Saharan
Africa, and many interventions are flourishing, coordination remains an issue that hinders the achievement of scaling
up and of lasting impact.

16 November 2016–31 May 2018

IMPLEMENTATION
Global and regional level, and Cambodia, Lebanon, Mali and Uganda.
COUNTRIES:

PROJECT RESULTS
Output 1: The knowledge base at global level on the specific challenges faced by rural youth between 15 and 17
years of age is strengthened and the good practices at policy, programmatic and legislative levels are drawn from
experiences of various sub-sectors and regions, and disseminated.

•	

The FAO Guidance note Child Labour in Agriculture in Protracted Crises, Fragile and Humanitarian Contexts, which was
developed and launched on World Day Against Child Labour in 2017, was translated into French. The guidance note
was a joint SP3–SP5 effort aimed at supporting the integration of child labour and youth employment issues for
15-to-17-year-olds in FAO emergency programmes, as well as informing the broader development and humanitarian
community. Since the translation, a Letter of Agreement (LoA) funded by the regular programme has been launched
for assessing the sensitivity to child labour of FAO resilience programmes in Mali.

•	
•	

FAO was invited to join the Child Labour Task Force of the Alliance for Child Protection in Humanitarian Action.

•	

Increased attention was given to promoting healthy generations in agriculture, reducing hazardous child labour and
promoting safe work for rural youth between 15 and 17 years of age amongst all agricultural sub-sectors.

The FAO e-learning course on child labour prevention and youth employment promotion was further developed,
adapted and promoted.

Output 2: Innovative and promising practices in the four selected countries are implemented, in view of improved
skills development, successful school-to-work transition and better and more employment options for rural youth
between 15 and 17 years of age in agriculture and the rural economy.

•	

89

In Lebanon, the joint FAO–UNICEF study on “Child labour in agriculture: from the demand side” was finalized. The
study sheds light on the nature and the extent of young people’s work in agriculture, and the institutional framework
to address the phenomenon. The joint study also evaluates how the labour market has been impacted by the Syrian
crisis and highlights child labour trends over the last decade. A qualitative assessment on “Child labour in the Bekaa”,
which researches the supply side of child labour in agriculture by Syrian refugees, was undertaken by the American
University of Beirut with support from FAO, the Ministry of Labour, ILO and UNICEF and the draft report finalized. In
early 2018, the findings of these two studies were presented and endorsed during a session of the National Steering
Committee to combat Worst Forms of Child Labour in the implementation of the National Action Plan by the Ministry
of Labour.

•	

In Mali, the “Protect children from pesticides” visual facilitator’s guide originally developed in French in Mali was
translated, publicly released and printed into the local language of Bambara. An awareness campaign was also
implemented in the circle of Bandiagara by the DIMITRA listeners’ clubs on the topic of child labour in agriculture. The
campaign involves 30 clubs in six communes. The strategy on the integration of younger youth is being implemented
to enable them to be part of the community, to express themselves, and for their aspirations to be heard. A series of
recreational and social activities was identified (for example through theatre).

•	

In Uganda, awareness was raised and the capacity of national stakeholders developed on preventing hazardous child
labour while promoting safe employment for youth. A visual guide focusing on the main risks children and younger
youth are exposed to in the various agricultural sub-sectors and how to mitigate these risks were developed. The tool
focuses on children and younger youth for all major risks in the priority value chains and will also illustrate mitigation
techniques.

CONTRIBUTION TO FAO RESULTS

•	

The project contributed to the Organizational Output 30202.

RESULTS / FMM GENERAL PRINCIPLES AND EFFECTS
PARTNERSHIPS

•	

In Lebanon, the work is building a solid partnership between FAO, ILO and UNICEF and fostering collaboration across
inter-agency coordination mechanisms (for example the Food Security Cluster, the Interagency Child Labour Task
Force and the National Action Plan to Combat Child Labour in Lebanon) as well as inter-ministerial collaboration (for
instance a Memorandum of Understanding is under development between the Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry
of Social Affairs, as well as joint activities with the Ministry of Labour). A working partnership is also building with the
American University of Beirut to integrate employment aspects into agricultural education. Child labour is a complex
issue and partnerships are key for a holistic approach addressing its multifaceted dimensions.

•	

In Mali, a solid partnership was created between FAO and ILO and support interministerial and multistakeholder
coordination, for instance through the national roadmap on addressing child labour in agriculture. Partnerships were
established in 2017 through LoAs with the national research institute IER (exploring green jobs opportunities for rural
youth) and local NGO Alphalog to support the integration of child labour and youth employment concerns in resilience
programming and integrated production and pest management extension activities (to be funded through the FAO
regular programme).

•	

In Cambodia, activities were undertaken in partnership with Humboldt University and in close collaboration with the
Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries.

•	

In Uganda, the partnership between FAO and the Ministry of Gender, Labour and Social Development as well as a
stronger partnership related to the MGLSD and the Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Industry and Fisheri.

CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT

•	

At the global/regional levels, the FAO e-learning on child labour prevention and youth employment promotion was
further developed, adapted and promoted. For example:

•	

In Lebanon, capacity development materials developed in 2017 are now being disseminated in the country. This
includes the Economic and Financial Education curriculum developed to increase financial literacy of youth engaged in
agricultural vocational training. Moreover, the guidebook Child labour in agriculture in Lebanon: A guide for practitioners
(2017) is being widely disseminated amongst practitioners, including agricultural extension workers, labour inspectors,
OSH inspectors, municipal police, social workers, and NGOs working with child labourers in rural areas to support
their capacity to address child labourers in agriculture. Finally, in 2018, two modules on financial literacy and
education for rural youth were developed: one module for formal education was tested in the seven agricultural high
schools of Lebanon. Another module for informal education and school dropouts was finalized and is planned to be
tested.

POLICY ADVICE

•	

In Lebanon, the workshop on financial education for youth and youth-inclusive finance supported the policy efforts of
the Higher Council for Childhood to promote a constructive dialogue with financial partners (banks and credit unions)
on youth and finance in Lebanon in the context of the Syrian crisis.

•	

In Mali, the project contributed to the finalization of the national roadmap on the elimination of child labour in
agriculture.

•	

In Uganda, the project worked together with the FMM-funded Integrated Country Approach (ICA) to provide
knowledge and background research to ensure coverage of rural youth between 15 and 17 years of age in Uganda’s
newly launched Youth in Agriculture Strategy by the Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Industry and Fisheries and its
partners.

•	

In Cambodia, the case study on skills for rural youth was developed to support the implementation of the agriculture
ministry’s Policy and Strategy Framework on Childhood Development and Protection in the Agriculture Sector 2016–
2020.

CATALYTIC EFFECTS

•	

At the global level, FAO has been invited to play a leading role in global action to achieve SDG target 8.7 (to eradicate
forced labour, modern slavery, human trafficking and child labour).

•	

There is a regional uptake of country-project outputs, including the Arabic version of a guidebook on child labour in
agriculture developed in Lebanon, which will be disseminated in other Arab countries addressing the issue of child
labour, and the RNE regional initiative on small-scale family farming contributed funding for a regional study on child
labour in agriculture.

•	

FMM work is also being scaled up by UN partners. The pesticide visual guide was translated into a storybook for
children together with UNICEF, and ILO is developing additional visual tools on promoting occupational safety and
health for young workers in the age group of 15-to-17-year-olds in collaboration with FAO (focused on reducing
hazardous work for young workers in fisheries, livestock and crop production).

•	

National partners are extending action, for example in Uganda the ministry ran rural radio programmes of their
own initiative inspired by project materials and would like to scale up activities with agricultural extension workers
on how to use both the pesticides visual tool and the risk assessment tool with local farmers and an expanded radio
programme reinforcing key messages for which resource mobilization is in process.

CROSS-SECTORAL WORK

•	

All work of this project is cross-sectoral, whether it is bringing together work on youth employment, child labour
and social protection (SP3) with pesticide risk reduction (SP2) or emergencies (SP5), or bringing together agencies
working on labour (ILO), agriculture (FAO) and education (UNICEF) or at national level brining labour, agriculture and
social affairs ministries together. The project has also brought private-sector actors in the mix, especially small-scale
producers’ organizations and agricultural workers’ organizations.

GENDER

•	

In Lebanon, data for the research studies were gender-disaggregated and the project is catalyzing a follow-up study on
rural adolescent girls.

•	

In Uganda, data for the occupational safety and health risk assessment was gender-disaggregated. This information
was used to analyze which particular OSH risks are more prevalent for women, girls, men and boys. This information
is featured in the final report and will contribute to awareness raising for the Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Industry
and Fisheries, the Ministry of Gender, Labour and Social Development, as well as other relevant stakeholder.
In addition, female students were empowered to raise awareness on protection from pesticides among their
communities and in a number of agricultural fora.

•	

In Cambodia, the practitioner’s guide ‘How to Bridge the Skills Gap to Promote Decent Rural (Youth) Employment’
includes specific information on how to address gender differences in skills and training needs assessment.

INNOVATION

91

•	

At the global level, the project brought the voices of small-scale producers’ organizations into two global conferences
on child labour in agriculture. These processes helped to shape the World Day Against Child Labour in 2018. There
was also innovation in capacity development activities that were carried out. This included the joint FAO/ILO course
“Putting an end to child labour in agriculture while promoting decent work for young people”, which was run as a
blended learning course mixing both e-learning and facilitated activities in the international training centre.

•	

In Lebanon, FAO and ILO are working together with UNICEF for the first time in a consistent manner on child labour in
agriculture and in the context of the refugee crises.

-----------------------Page 108 End-----------------------

CHALLENGES IN PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND LESSONS LEARNED
Challenges

	

•	

In Mali, the pace of action at national level was slow. Given the short time-frame of the project and the time needed to
recruit and train someone qualified at the local level, this was forsaken.

•	

In Cambodia, one of the greatest challenges was to maintain a sharp focus on the age group of 15-to-17-year-olds. The
intent was to understand the specific issues related to this age group in terms of needed skills and access to decent
rural employment opportunities. Nevertheless, there are also many shared challenges with those under 15 or over 17
years of age, wherefore in the fieldwork it made sense to involve youth in other age cohorts to get an idea of the skills
they would need in the future. The study was thus expanded to focus on youth in general. This taught our team that
a narrow focus on the age cohort of 15-to-17-year-olds is not always the best approach and depending on the context
other age cohorts should be assessed.

•	

In Uganda, the challenge was to take extra care in ensuring government ownership. For the OSH assignment, a
national stakeholder consultation took place before commencement of activities, as well as after the results were
obtained. In the case of the legal study, a validation workshop took place after the research had been carried out.
Nevertheless, in the case of both initiatives, different government representatives expressed that further research
in certain areas would be needed in order for them to be fully confident on the results. This was challenging both
in terms of finances as well as time constraints. As government ownership and awareness-raising is crucial for the
sustainability of the activities, we took these activities very seriously. In both cases we allowed for the specific research
questions or concerns to be addressed in the final product, including the legal study as well as the in-depth OSH risk
assessment report.

PROJECT RESULTS
The results achieved in 2018 for each output are synthetized below:
Output 1: Improved evidence-base to harness the potential of migration for rural development

•	

In 2017, FAO and the Senegalese National Statistics Agency (Agence Nationale de la Statistique et de la Démographie)
implemented a household survey to collected information on migration, agriculture and rural livelihoods. The final
data were delivered in January 2018. Using the dataset, the following studies were finalized in 2018:
	 Study 1: Characteristics, dynamics and drivers of rural migration in Senegal: This study sheds light on the
characteristics, patterns and drivers of rural migration from two Senegalese regions: Kaolack and Matam. This
study helps inform territorial, youth employment and rural development policies.
	 Study 2: Assessment of the labour absorption capacity of rural areas in sub-Saharan Africa: A Computable
General Equilibrium analysis for Kenya and Senegal: Social Accounting Matrices and Computable General
Equilibrium models were developed to estimate the demand for and supply of labour in rural labour markets, as
well as to determine rural-to-urban migration trends in Kenya and Senegal.

	 Study 3: Characteristics and Impacts of Migrant Remittances and Skills Transfer: this study includes an analysis
of the structure of remittances and their impacts on households’ living conditions in rural areas; an analysis of
the contribution of migrants’ diaspora on productive investment, job creation and entrepreneurship in on- and
off-farm activities; identification and capitalization of good investment practices by migrants; and a proposition
of innovative financing mechanisms to channel migrants’ remittances to more productive investments.
	 Study 4: Impact of public social protection programmes in Senegal on the decision of beneficiary households to
migrate: The study includes an analysis of the functioning of the “Bourse de securité familiale”, its impacts on the
livelihood of beneficiary households and its effects on their propensity to migrate.
	 Study 5: Male Out-Migration and Women’s Work and Empowerment in Agriculture: the Case of Nepal and
Senegal. This study analyzed the linkages between migration and women’s work and empowerment in
agriculture in Nepal and Senegal. The study finds that male out-migration from rural, primary agricultural areas
is strongly and significantly linked to changes in women’s roles in agriculture in both countries.
	 Study 6: Rural migrations in the dynamics of the Senegalese migration: this document extends and develops a
contribution to the CIRAD–FAO Atlas “Rural Africa in motion. Dynamics and factors of migrations south of the
Sahara”, published in English in November 2017 and released in early April 2018 in its French version.
Output 2: Strengthening institutional arrangements to support migrants, improving their institutional capacity
and political dialogue to encourage productive investments in order to create decent agricultural and nonagricultural jobs for rural youth in migration-prone areas
Two following studies were finalized:

•	
•	

Study 1. Diagnosis of technical support schemes for migrant initiatives: this study identifies all technical support
mechanisms for migrants in Senegal and provides a diagnosis of their organization, performance and impact, with a
view to proposing recommendations that could improve their intervention.
Study 2. Mapping of financial support mechanisms for businesses and migrant initiatives and the valuation of
remittances: In this study identifies all financial support mechanisms for migrants in Senegal and provides a diagnosis
of their performance and impact.

Activity 1: Capacity Development workshop for technical support initiatives for migrants

•	

A capacity development workshop was organized jointly with the Direction Général des Sénégalais de l’Extérieure from
9 to 12 April 2018 in the city of Thiès, Senegal. The four-day technical workshop aimed at empowering the facilitators
of the target support mechanisms for migrant initiatives, including enhancing their knowledge on migration and rural
development. The 30 participants and content were selected based on the diagnostic study, which identified the
support structures, their activities and their needs for capacity building. Apart from building capacity, the encounter
between the different initiatives enabled them to share experiences and good practices. The participants received a
training manual after the workshop, highlighting the main takeaways of the workshop.

•	

The final closing and validation workshop of the project was held on 26 April 2018 in Dakar, Senegal. The workshop
brought together 100 stakeholders actively involved in the field of migration. During the workshop, the analytical
results of the project were shared and the key messages and recommendations of the roadmap validated.

CONTRIBUTION TO FAO RESULTS

•	

The project contributes to the overarching goal of addressing the root causes of distress migration and harnessing
the development potential of migration for agriculture and rural development. In doing so, it contributes to the
Sustainable Development Goals, in particular to Goal 10.7 aimed at facilitating “orderly, safe, regular and responsible
migration and mobility of people, including through the implementation of planned and well-managed migration
policies”, and Goal 8 “Promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment
and decent work for all.”

•	

With regard to Output 2, FAO partnered with: (i) the Direction Générale des Sénégalais de l’Extérieur of the Ministry
of Foreign Affairs; (ii) the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Equipment; (iii) the Ministry of Livestock and Animal
Production; (iv) the Ministry of Youth, Employment and Citizenship; (v) the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Senegalese
Abroad; (vi) the Directorate-General for Social Protection and National Solidarity; (vii) IOM; (viii) ANPEJ; (ix) Dakar
Cheikh Anta Diop University and Gaston Berger University of Saint-Louis; (x) Migrant and Diaspora Associations;
(xi) Youth and producer organizations; (xii) Other international organizations and resource partners (IOM, IFAD, the
European Union, and the Italian and Spanish Delegations in Senegal).

CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT

•	

The project focused strongly on increasing the capacities and raising awareness among key stakeholders. In April
2018, based on the previous consultations and capacity needs analysis, a capacity development workshop was
jointly organized by FAO and the Directorate responsible for Migration. The four-day technical workshop gathered 30
facilitators working in different support mechanisms for migration initiatives. During the workshop, the participants
received training to understand the linkages between migration and rural development and the existing government
initiatives. The workshop also offered the participants to share experiences and good practices of their own initiatives.

POLICY ADVICE

•	

The project provided policy advice on Senegal’s draft national migration policy and recommending the government
to better incorporate issues related to agriculture and rural development. The project’s roadmap provides a mapping
of all the policies and programmes related to migration and agriculture and rural development, as well as the main
institutions and actors. Policy recommendations are structured around four main work areas: analysis, capacity
development, partnerships and advocacy.

•	

The regional consultations held in the 14 regions of Senegal jointly with the DGSE in 2017 resulted in an continued
policy dialogue between FAO and the DGSE. FAO provided suggestions and inputs on the implementation of the new
migration policy, particularly in rural areas. In this perspective, FAO continues to support the efforts of the DGSE to
promote rural development and youth employment through strengthened migration governance in policies related
to agriculture, employment, and rural development, by contributing to the strengthening of migration governance
through broad and inclusive consultation on policies related to agriculture, employment and rural development.

CATALYTIC EFFECTS

•	

Not applicable.

CROSS-SECTORAL WORK

•	

In general, the work of this project is by definition cross-sectoral, bringing together youth employment, migration,
social protection, gender, and different UN agencies such as IOM and IFAD. At the national level, the project is bringing
together state actors such as the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Agriculture and the Directorate for Social
Protection.

•	

With the success of the final national workshop in Dakar in April 2018, the project brought together national and
rural stakeholders, financial institutions, migrants’ and diaspora associations, youth and producer organizations
in Senegal. Cross-sectoral policy recommendations were consolidated with the aim to promote decent rural
employment for young women and men by increasing productive investments of remittances and cash transfers and
improving the links with other rural financial services in migration-prone areas. The project contributed to improved
policy coherence between different policy areas, and in particular among agricultural and agribusiness, migration,
employment, rural finance and social protection policies.

GENDER

•	

95

The project successfully implemented the household survey with a specific module on gender and women’s work.
It serves as an input to the study on the impact of male migration on women’s empowerment in agriculture, which
was conducted by the FAO Gender Team. The Study 1 on migration dynamics in rural areas also addressed gender
equality by looking at the specific constraints facing young women and men in rural areas and analyzing differences
in their migration patterns and behaviours. The results from these studies will translate into gender-sensitive
recommendations and capacity development, as well as into ensuring that the roadmap and any actions and financial
mechanisms proposed are gender-aware and actively contribute to reducing gender inequalities in the rural labour
market.

Annexes

-----------------------Page 112 End-----------------------

INNOVATION

•	

The project pioneered the gathering of information and knowledge on the links between migration, remittances, social
cash transfers and productive agricultural investments in rural areas. It helps to strengthen FAO’s evidence-based
policy recommendations.

•	

The project brought together national and rural stakeholders, financial institutions, migrants’ and diaspora
associations, youth and producer organizations in Senegal to promote decent rural employment for young women
and men, by increasing productive investments of remittances and cash transfers and improving the links with other
rural financial services in migration-prone areas.

CHALLENGES IN PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND LESSONS LEARNED
Challenges

•	

The main challenges in the implementation of this project were the burdensome bureaucratic processes, both at
headquarters and at country level. These constraints were amplified due to the limited timing of the project.

Lessons learned

•	

A national coordinator in the country is indispensable, as well as good planning with sufficient time for bureaucracy.

•	

97

Between January and May 2018, the number of DIMITRA Clubs increased from 1 900 to 2 500, accounting for
75 000 members (two thirds of which are women) who are actively participating in the clubs and transforming
their environment. It is estimated that this dynamic process positively impacts more than two million people. This
dramatic increase is directly related to the decision made by country and regional projects to use the clubs as an
empowerment, gender and community mobilization tool in their projects. For the first months of 2018, the increase
took place mainly in Senegal (200) and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (400).

Annexes

-----------------------Page 114 End-----------------------

•	

A few new elements that evolved in 2018 are worth mentioning: (i) gender-based violence has been addressed in the
majority of DIMITRA Clubs, resulting in specific discussions and actions; (ii) ICTs are increasingly being a key driver
to facilitate communication and improve the results; (iii) the use of the clubs is growing in all kinds of projects with
community activities. Its use as a tool for peace-building and social cohesion was highlighted as crucial in post-conflict
situations and refugee camps.

Output 3: Partnerships are developed with FAO DOs, programmes and projects, and with other national and
international partners, to promote rural women’s and men’s empowerment, women’s leadership, gender equality,
social mobilization and local governance

•	

Partnership within FAO and other stakeholders (governments, NGOs and other UN agencies) is crucial for the uptake
and scaling-up of the approach. More than 25 FAO country projects were using or planning the approach as at May
2018 in several sub-Saharan countries, working on different technical areas, sometimes in partnership with other UN
agencies. Partnership within FAO is increasing, starting from the countries where the Dimitra Clubs approach has been
implemented and outstanding results obtained.

CONTRIBUTION TO FAO RESULTS

•	

Since the DIMITRA Clubs model is crosscutting, the results contributes to all FAO strategic objectives (SO1, SO2, SO3,
SO5) and to several SDGs.

RESULTS / FMM GENERAL PRINCIPLES AND EFFECTS
PARTNERSHIPS

•	

Between June 2017 and May 2018, there was a 40-percent increase of new partnerships at country level with FAO
projects. The increase translated in the first months of 2018 into an additional 1 000 DIMITRA Clubs.

CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT

•	

In 2018, all the training activities at local level (Democratic Republic of the Congo, Mali, Niger and Senegal) took
place in the framework of other projects. The projects funded training workshops on gender issues, DIMITRA Clubs
methodology, technical issues and development partners. Community sensitization visits were organized in all the
villages where new clubs were set up, including for administrative and traditional authorities and decentralized
government offices, among others.

POLICY ADVICE

•	

In 2018, no policy advice was given.

CATALYTIC EFFECTS

•	

The FMM project’s catalytic effects are profound in the way FAO national and regional projects took up the DIMITRA
Clubs approach, thus providing funding for its implementation. The gender-transformative and community
mobilization aspects of the approach are highly appreciated, as are the sustainability of the results. The results of the
clubs continue to be showcased in publications of FAO and other organizations.

CROSS-SECTORAL WORK

•	

The results and impact of the model show their flexibility and use in different areas of work. In 2018, cross-sectoral
work was pursued at FAO headquarters and DOs (Gender Team; Rural Institutions, Services and Empowerment Team,
AGPM-FFS; TCIA, AGL, ESN and SP5).

GENDER

•	

FAO DIMITRA Clubs are recognized by FAO and development partners as a gender-transformative approach
to promoting rural peoples’ empowerment, gender equality, people’s empowerment, women’s leadership and
participation in the life of the village. The issue of gender-based violence is being increasingly addressed in the
projects thanks to the DIMITRA Clubs.

Flexible Multi-Partner Mechanism Annual Report 2018

-----------------------Page 115 End-----------------------

INNOVATION
The following innovations relevant to 2018 are worth mentioning:

•	

A new methodology were successfully tested in Mali and Senegal to train the external facilitators and the leaders of
the clubs.

•	

The national and regional Whatsapp groups that were set up proved to be a useful tool to exchange good practices,
pictures and videos, as well as to ask for advice. It also served as a powerful continuous training instrument for the
Dimitra Clubs facilitators and implementing partners.

CHALLENGES IN PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND LESSONS LEARNED
Challenges

•	

The transfer of the coordinator in June 2018 to the bridging project created challenges in providing support to the
countries. All support activities related to advocacy, knowledge products, field missions, impact assessment in the
Democratic Republic of the Congo had to be cancelled.

•	
•	

The deterioration of geo-political situation increased in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Mali and the Niger.
Financial uncertainty in the medium term is particularly a concern when it comes to a transformation of mindsets
on rural development projects and innovative approaches and tools that need a longer time frame and dedicated
resources for promoting the results (evidence-based information).

Lessons learned

•	

99

Following the good lessons learnt, the DIMITRA Clubs are fully integrated into the FAO Community Resilience Strategy,
the Caisses de resilience approach and increasingly as a support to the Farmer Field School (FFS) approach.

•	

Between May and December 2018, the number of DIMITRA Clubs increased from 2 500 to 3 000, accounting for 90
000 members (two thirds of whom are women) who are actively participating in the clubs and transforming their
environment. It is estimated that this dynamic process positively impacts more than 2.2 million people. The increase
took place mainly in the Central African Republic (50), the Democratic Republic of the Congo (250), Mali (100) and the
Niger (100). About 800 DIMITRA Clubs were expected to be set up in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 2019.
The use of the DIMITRA Clubs increasingly regards projects in fragile and post-conflict situations aiming at improving

FAO’s work in relation to “Ensuring good governance, gender equality and empowerment of women and rule of law in

food security and production, peace building, resilience and livelihoods in general, as well as climate change. The
DIMITRA Clubs have an added value in terms of gender, community mobilization, inclusive participation, dialogue
and social cohesion, behaviour changes including in gender roles, and voices of women and youth. Governments and
line ninistries (in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Mali and the Niger) are also requesting FAO to scale up the
approach.

•	

In the case of DRE, this bridging phase allowed to: (i) ensure the follow-up of activities related to the Integrated Country
Approach (ICA) for promoting decent rural youth employment project; (ii) operationalize the third phase of the ICA
programme; (iii) continue providing technical support to country-led efforts for resource mobilization for rural youth
employment; and (iv) disseminate results and lessons learned.

In addition,

•	

Technical support was provided to ensure a smooth transition from the ICA global programme to FAO TCP activities
led by country offices, especially with regard to the development and implementation of two spin-off TCP projects
in Guatemala (TCP/GUA/3703/C3 and TCP/GUA/3701/C1) and one TCP project in Senegal (TCPF/SEN/3701 Appui à la
stratégie de développement de l’employabilité et de l’entreprenariat des jeunes en milieu rural, à travers la consolidation et
l’extension du MIJA);

•	

Technical support was provided to country-led efforts for resource mobilization on rural youth employment, through
the development of a joint UNESCO–FAO–IOM proposal presented to the Peace Building Fund in Guatemala and a
project proposal presented to USAID;

•	

Technical support was provided to the development of a tool and guidelines to conduct youth-employment focused
value chain analysis. The analysis, conducted through an SP3-funded LoA, was developed and tested in Uganda in
close collaboration with SP4;

•	

The programme proposal for the next phase of the ICA programme was finalized and several exchanges with relevant
country offices and FAO headquarter divisions (TCR, CBL, DPS, OED, LEG, OSP and CSF) took place between May 2018
and December 2018 in order to operationalize the project and ensure a smooth transition from the second phase to
the new one. The Integrated Country Approach for boosting decent jobs for youth in the agri–food system (ICA programme)
will operate in Guatemala, Kenya, Rwanda, Senegal and Uganda during the period 2019–2022 with the aim of assisting
countries in adopting and implementing more youth-inclusive agri–food system development policies, strategies and
programmes;

•	

A broader proposal on ICA as FAO flagship programme for decent rural youth employment was developed and
finalized in the framework of FAO’s Business Development Portfolio;

•	

A 12-month programme was carried out together with the Hanns R. Neumann Foundation to train and link young
coffee growers in Guatemala to specialized coffee markets;

•	

A study on child labour in the coffee sector was developed together with a set of recommendations on how to address
the issue;

•	

The FAO–ILO visual guide ”Protect Children from Pesticides” was translated and printed into Bambara and has further
worked to create awareness on the importance of addressing child labour in agriculture through the DIMITRA Listener
clubs;

•	

Continued dissemination of the visual guide through ongoing projects in Uganda, especially those on promoting
community-based management of Fall Army Worm where 30 extension workers from 10 districts were trained on
the guide. The guide was also disseminated during the World Food Day held in Nakapiripirit district in Karamoja and
through other media events organized by the FAO Representation in Uganda;

•	

Technical support was provided to the development of the FAO–ILO Regional Child Labour report, adopted by the
Arab Summit in Lebanon.

The project contributed to SP1–SP5.

RESULTS / FMM GENERAL PRINCIPLES AND EFFECTS
PARTNERSHIPS

•	

101

In Senegal, collaboration was established with the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) and
the Technical Centre for Agricultural and Rural Co-operation (CTA) to enhance the MIJA platform model in terms of its

Annexes

-----------------------Page 118 End-----------------------

•	

In Guatemala, collaboration was established with the Hanns R Neumann Foundation (HRNS) for the provision of two
workshops carried out in December 2018. FAO and HRNS facilitated a workshop for policymakers on the results of
youth employment generation programme on specialized coffee, along with another capacity development workshop
on addressing child labour in the coffee sector.

CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT

•	

From June to December 2018, the training activities were organized directly by field projects.

POLICY ADVICE

•	

Not applicable.

CATALYTIC EFFECTS

•	

In the case of DIMITRA, the FMM projects’ catalytic effects continue with the uptake of the DIMITRA Clubs approach in
new countries (Benin,Burkina Faso, Côte d’Ivoire and Papua New Guinea, who have expressed a strong interest in the
model) and new projects have integrated the approach.

•	

In the case of DRE, based on the work carried out in Mali under the FMM Enabling rural youth between 15 and 17 years
of age to access decent work (FMM/GLO/119/MUL), two Letters of Agreements were signed and executed in 2018. One
programme tested its guidance note on Child Labour in Agriculture in Protracted Crises, Fragile and Humanitarian
Contexts through the evaluation of FAO resilience interventions in the country also documenting lessons learned to
further develop the tool. While the other carried out a study to generate knowledge on the biopesticide sector in Mali,
as well as its potential to enable rural youth to gain access to economically and environmentally beneficial jobs under
safe and sanitary conditions.

•	

Furthermore, based on the adoption of the joint FAO–ILO Regional Child Labour report in Lebanon, it was publically
announced that all League of Arab States are committed to following up on its recommendations starting with a
regional action plan, to directing interventions on the ground and to protecting children from exploitative child labour
in the region.

CROSS-SECTORAL WORK

•	

The project pursued cross-sectoral work at FAO headquarters and DOs (Gender Team; Rural Institutions, Services and
Empowerment Team, AGPM-FFS; TCIA, AGL, ESN and SP5).

GENDER

•	

FAO DIMITRA Clubs are recognized by FAO and development partners as a corporate gender-transformative approach
to promote rural peoples’ empowerment, gender equality, people’s empowerment, women’s leadership and
participation in the life of the village. The issue of gender-based violence is also being increasingly addressed in FAO
field projects thanks to the DIMITRA Clubs.

•	

Gender issues have been mainstreamed as cross-cutting topic, as inherent component of the concept of decent
work. Gender issues were analyzed in dedicated sections of the assessment developed, and addressed in all
supported policies and strategies. Rural women’s empowerment was included as crosscutting dimension in the youth
employment-focused value-chain assessment tool. The FAO online policy database contains 47 documents where
gender equality is the main policy area, and 238 where rural women are an explicit target group.

INNOVATION

•	

In the case of DIMITRA, the following innovations regarding 2018 are worth mentioning. The approach was
successfully adapted for specific situations such as refugee camps and peace-building projects. A new training
methodology was successfully tested in Mali and Senegal (for external facilitators and leaders of the clubs). It needs to
be developed and published to help countries implement the approach. The use of whatsapp groups has proved to be
useful to exchange good practices, pictures and videos, and to ask for advice at field level.

•	

In the case of DRE, the ICA project contributed to spurring innovation in terms of new approaches and methodologies
for decent rural youth-employment promotion, including through the development of a tool to conduct youthemployment-focused value-chain analysis. The value chain analysis tool was developed and tested in Uganda in the
coffee value chain with the aim of revealing which stages of food production and processing are most promising for
youth employment creation.

CHALLENGES IN PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND LESSONS LEARNED
Challenges

•	

The resources provided through the FMM in 2018 and 2019, as well as the coming years, will be crucial to maintaining
FAO DIMITRA Clubs expertise for providing technical and methodological support to the projects/countries and
generating knowledge products. However, it will not be sufficient to scale up the approach, build an efficient learning
framework and organize impact assessments. The resources foreseen in the new FMM (2019–2020) are insufficient to
cover these elements.

•	

Extra-budgetary resources are needed for future years to scale up the approach in new regions and generate in-depth
evidence-based knowledge on the impact of the approach.

Lessons learned

103

•	

The challenges linked to the geo-political situation have increased in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Mali and
the Niger.

•	

Financial uncertainty in the medium term is a challenge as the model promoted requires a shift in the mindset of
development practitioners and decision makers. This shift needs a longer time frame as well as dedicated resources
for measuring and promoting the results.

PROJECT RESULTS
All major activities were completed as of 31 December 2017, as originally planned. The extension of the implementation
period provided an opportunity to consolidate and share the results of the FFF Phase I and helped to promote key
elements from the lessons learned for scaling up in FFF Phase II.

•	

Travel funding sponsored participants in a final workshop in February 2018 in the Market Analyses and Development
training cycle that had been supported earlier in Plurinational State of Bolivia– leading to the formulation of several
enterprise development plans for forest and farm producer organizations. Travel of partners to a meeting in Rome
helped build on lessons learned to draft an improved Monitoring and Learning System for FFF Phase II, which is now in
place and being operationalized.

•	

Travel for participation of FFF team members in a series of international meetings to highlight lesson-learning and
share the impacts from FFF Phase I and the FMM funding.

This FMM funding was instrumental in taking the first Phase of the FFF programme to a successful conclusion – its
supplementary support to an ongoing programme that needed the funds to show the proof-of-concept of this pilot
phase was vital and an important acknowledgement of the work as a priority, especially under SP3 Output 3.1.1. The
work was made more effective by the close collaboration and support across the organizations, especially with the
DPS teams on strengthening producer organization and cooperatives, the South–South Collaboration, Indigenous
Peoples liaison office, the Communications for Development and the SP3 management teams.

IMPLEMENTATION
Rwanda and Senegal
COUNTRIES:

PROJECT RESULTS
•	

Four Digital Value Added Services (DVAS) were developed for smallholders and family farmers in Rwanda and Senegal
through mobile applications. A Progressive Web App (PWA), web services (APIs) and RapidPro-based services for
Text and Voice messages (SMS and IVR) were developed and tested in the field with farmers’ communities, extension
workers and local institutions. The services are:
	 Weather and Crop calendar; combines information on weather forecasts and crop calendars.
	 Cure and Feed your livestock; real time information on animal diseases control and animal feeding best
practices.
	 AgriMarketplace; connects producers and traders to facilitate trade and access to price information.
	 E-Nutrifood; information on production, conservation and consumption of nutritious foods.

•	

The services were designed with the users (Human-Centred Design Approach) through the organization of 3
workshops in the field. The participants were selected on the basis of the following criteria: gender balance (50 percent
of the farmers were women or girls), technology balance (participants having smartphones and feature phones),
representation balance (representatives of cooperatives, community leaders and Farmer Field School representatives),
and famer diversity (different crops cultivated, different areas of the region and different farm–livestock composition).

•	

The project is working with Local Software Developers in close collaboration with the government focal points, focal
points of strategic partners in the regions, local leaders and associations besides the extension agents (‘Understand
the Ecosystem’). In Rwanda, teachers and students from the Tumba Technology College are following and participating
in the project as local accelerators and incubators. The project is working with Smart Villages and ICT Chamber/kLab in
Rwanda and Yeesal in Senegal (‘Design for Scale’).

•	

From a gender perspective, the project aims at increasing the access of women to relevant, reliable, timely and
actionable information to take better decisions about their lives, the management of their assets and their families. In
the pilot phase, the test groups were constructed guaranteeing that 50 percent of the test users would be female.

•	

The project ensured integration of the Progressive Web App (PWA), Text/SMS (RapidPro) and Web Services (APIs)
linked to existing FAO data products like the FAO GIEWS price tool, FAO Earth Observations and the FAO Water
Productivity Portal. (‘Reuse and Improve’). All data services of the apps are published and stored as open APIs.

•	

Sustainability is one of the aspects that this project strongly promoted. In this context, a series of actions,
commitments and identification of value for small farmers, as well as for different organizations was discussed,
negotiated and accepted. This is one of the important characteristics in terms of the business model that was
developed in this project.

•	

In terms of impact, it was impossible to assess it at the time of producing this information (May 2018), as the
application was still under active development and farmers and strategic partners were providing ongoing feedback.
This feedback is being gathered during the workshops and the training sessions but it is not enough to assess the
impact generated by the application on the daily life of the users. This will be assessed once the application is released
and used by a massive number of users.

CONTRIBUTION TO FAO RESULTS

•	

This project contributed to Output 3.1.3 and 3.1.4.

RESULTS / FMM GENERAL PRINCIPLES AND EFFECTS
PARTNERSHIPS

•	

Strategic partnerships were established with CTIC Dakar in Senegal and ICT Chamber in Rwanda. Both partnerships
were formalized through a Letter of Agreement; CTIC Dakar110 is the first incubator and accelerator for IT and mobile
technology young entrepreneurs founded in West Africa. It is particularly meaningful to liaise with local organizations
that track innovation paths for the future and can provide local contents and local knowledge. ICT Chamber111 is
the youngest member of the Private Sector Federation, bringing together ICT Associations, businesses, groups and
individuals into a community where they can share ideas on how to promote and develop Rwanda’s ICT and ICTenabled Industries.

CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT

•	

Training workshops were organized in Tambacounda, Senegal, on 28 of March 2018. The workshop aimed to test in
each country the first version of the application with around 50 participants to show how it works, test its usability and
gather a first round of feedback.

POLICY ADVICE

•	

Since the project has not reached a conclusion yet, there is no specific policy recommendation at the moment.

CATALYTIC EFFECTS

107

•	

Through the contacts to develop the Weather and Crop Calendar service, CIO has started a relationship with the World
Meteorological Organization (WMO). The two agencies have signed a UN-to-UN agency agreement to improve the
climate and agrometeorological services in Rwanda and Senegal.

•	

Also, liaison with other FAO projects is ongoing, with several request coming in to expose information and knowledge
generated by other projects inside the Digital Services portfolio. The FAO Digital Services Portfolio serves as a
mechanism to “unlock” their data, information and knowledge for the use by small-scale farmers as digital services.
For example, the Water Productivity portal, the Roots and Tubers Project, the Technical Support System (TSS) teams
and the FPMA GIEWS Price Tool showcase their data through web services in the Portfolio and help “democratize” the
data for the use by small-scale farmers.

•	

The project established ongoing working relationships with local incubators, ICT Chamber and kLab in Rwanda and
Yeesal Agrihub and CTIC Dakar in Senegal. The latter assisted in selecting and working with young developers from
both countries to develop the Digital Services Portfolio. This collaboration is ongoing through several FAO project
activities to “expose” their data and information in the Portfolio through a new TCP in Rwanda.

•	

A ‘hackathon’ was organized in Kigali, Rwanda, in collaboration with the National Project Consultant, local developers
and strategic partner ICT chamber.

•	

Ongoing collaborative efforts are under way with the national Meteo Services Meteo Rwanda and ANACIM in
collaboration with WMO, supported by the local software developers. They advocate for and build capacity to
unlock Data and Information as Open Data to increase the impact and reach of Digital Climate Services, for the use
by governments, extension workers and farmers. This is especially important for enhancing resilience and climate
adaptation.

•	

As a direct result of the FAO Digital Services Portfolio Project, Engaging Youth in Agriculture and ICT was moved to
the center of the discussion around Digital Inclusion and Migration. As a result, the “Youth in Agriculture as a Solid
Solution to ending Hunger and Poverty in Africa – Engaging through Information and Communication Technologies
(ICTs) and Entrepreneurship112” was organized in Rwanda.

-----------------------Page 124 End-----------------------

CROSS-SECTORAL WORK

•	

All work in this project is cross-sectoral as it is bringing together government ministries and private-sector actors.

GENDER

•	

The project emphasizes the gender perspective and specifically targets the needs of women and female-headed
households. The project aims at increasing the access of women to relevant, reliable, timely and actionable
information to take better decisions about their lives, the management of their assets and their families. In the pilot
phase, the test groups were constructed guaranteeing that 50 percent of the test users would be female.

INNOVATION

•	

This model, based on a set of Digital Value Added Services portfolio, will make the leap forward to provide high-quality
information services close to family farmers and extension workers, such as local veterinarians, agricultural extension
agents and nutrition experts using innovative and the most convenient digital technologies. The services were
designed with special attention to the specific needs of women and youth.

CHALLENGES IN PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND LESSONS LEARNED
Challenges

•	

The limited experience of FAO, CIO and the Project Leader and Core Working Group in similar earlier initiatives
has to be recognized. Thus, the complexity of the digital translation of contents in a pedagogical format and easily
understandable by our main client was challenging.

•	
•	

The delayed signature of the LoAs hampered the early engagement of the local government.

•	

Lack of data and information was another challenge, as assumed at the inception of the project. Making these data
from TSS teams and national partners available for direct use by farmers as digital services is a huge challenge.

•	

The time for the project implementation was too short; a second project year is often necessary to consolidate and
improve the results obtained in the first project year, but if more time had been available it would have been useful
to have some specific Human Design workshops and activities before shaping the services in order to make sure that
the most appropriate design would be adopted from the beginning of the development. All of these aspects caused a
delay for which a no-cost extension was requested from FMM and agreed by the donors.

One of the main problems during the implementation was the real commitment and involvement of local institutions,
as well as the limited participation of the focal points designated by each ministry. Almost all of them were not really
the right persons to be involved, as their background and internal responsibilities were connected to IT technical areas
instead of to those concerning the real contents of the services. Sometimes the focal points showed lack of autonomy
and indecisiveness to serve as a direct communication channel with the relevant actors in the Ministries to take
decisions forward.

PROJECT RESULTS

109

•	

In Lebanon, the FMM supported the creation and implementation of a pilot-farmer registry in collaboration with the
Ministry of Agriculture. In addition, the project organized a workshop on 16 February 2018 under the patronage of
the Ministry to present the results of the 2017 pilot, the legal and institutional proposal for the register establishment
including the definition of farmers and fishers, and their inclusion in the National Social Security Fund. Fifty-seven
participants from relevant ministries and UN organizations attended and contributed to the discussion on the farmerregister aspects. This activity paved the way for the organization of a high-level workshop to occur during 2019 in
partnership with ILO and decision makers of line ministries on the expansion of Social Protection to rural areas.

•	

In Lesotho, the FMM complemented the ongoing evaluation of the Child Grants Programme (CGP) and Sustainable
Poverty Reduction through Income, Nutrition and access to Government Services (SPRINGS) with additional data
collection focused on anthropometric indicators and qualitative analysis. The integrated approach of the CGP plus
SPRINGS was an innovative intervention, led by FAO, in partnership with UNICEF and the Government of Lesotho.
A workshop was organized by FAO on 13 September 2018 to present the results of the study in Maseru, and 50
participants from relevant ministries and UN organizations attended and contributed to the event.

•	

In Mali, FMM contributed to advocate for greater linkages of social protection with resilience and productive
interventions. The activities were tailored to specific requests from the Ministry of Solidarity and Humanitarian Action
to provide options for the expansion of coverage of social protection to rural populations combined with productive
support. The initiative is part of the support to the National Plan of Expansion of Social Protection. In collaboration
with the Commissariat Securité Alimentaire and WFP, a study on improving coordination between existing safety nets
and crises prevention/response was undertaken. To complete the study, a two-day workshop was held in Bamako
(28–29 May 2018) with 26 participants. The FMM also supported an evaluation led by the FAO Emergency Office for
West Africa of a Cash+ programme in Mali and Mauritania that aims to provide information for designing similar
programmes and strengthening the livelihoods of chronically poor households or those affected by one-off or
recurrent shocks.

•	

In Zambia, key activities undertaken in the country for social protection have allowed FAO to be recognized as a critical
actor in the national social protection sector and among development partners. FAO has since been formally included
as one of the members of a United Nations Joint Programme (UNJP) on social protection, where it is leading the
support to the Livelihoods and Empowerment pillar of the programme.

Annexes

-----------------------Page 126 End-----------------------

•	

Through the FMM and as part of the joint programme, in 2017–2018 FAO supported a qualitative assessment of the
national Food Security Pack (FSP) programme. The results of this assessment are being used as a basis for developing
a pilot project for the FSP and some of the findings were incorporated in the draft revised FSP programme policies and
procedures.

•	

FAO finalized a Livelihoods Profiling study jointly with the Indaba Agricultural Policy Research Institute (IAPRI), a
national agricultural think-tank to inform the roll-out of social protection and agricultural programmes based on the
varying livelihoods profiles and characteristics of farmers.

•	

The FMM supported the Impact Evaluation of the Home Grown School Feeding programme and market access
programmes and the results were shared and validated through a national stakeholder workshop organized by FAO
on 26 June 2018. Consequently a follow-up qualitative study is planned to answer some of the questions generated by
the quantitative study.

CONTRIBUTION TO FAO RESULTS
The FMM financial contribution effectively complemented the regular budget of FAO’s Social Protection Team and selected
country teams to strengthen the work on social protection.

FMM GENERAL PRINCIPLES AND EFFECTS
PARTNERSHIPS

•	

In Lebanon, the project strengthened the collaboration and coordination between the Ministry of Agriculture and the
concerned line ministries and institutions (especially with the Ministry of Social Affairs and the Ministry of Labour)
as well as with local authorities. Farmers were consulted all throughout the design and implementation. The pilot
was supported and owned by the national stakeholders and will be scaled up through a recently approved European
Union-funded Project (Regional Trust Fund in response to the Syrian crisis named MADAD). The total amount of
funds allocated to this project is around EUR 25 million (EUR 1.2 million dedicated to scaling up) and its duration is
24 months, starting January 2019. This will allow to build a strong basis to support the expansion of social protection
in rural areas, as well as on promoting rural livelihoods through social protection and agricultural interventions.
The FMM project was also able to build important synergies with another ongoing initiative of the General Fisheries
Commission for the Mediterranean, which aims at assessing and expanding the coverage of social protection to smallscale fisheries, by integrating the fishing sector into the scope of the farmers’ registry.

•	

In Lesotho, the FMM strengthened the ongoing FAO partnership with UNICEF and the Government of Lesotho for
building a strong case for the coherence between social protection and livelihood interventions targeting poor and
rural families. The results of this evidence are feeding into policy discussions of Government and other partners’
efforts to scale up integrated, multi-sector interventions for poverty reduction and food security in Lesotho.

•	

In Mali, technical support was provided to improve coordination mechanisms between social assistance and shorthumanitarian response in partnership with the Commissariat for Food and Nutrition Security and WFP (a Letter of
Agreement was signed with the Government).

•	

In Zambia the FMM supported the ongoing collaboration with ILO and the National Pension Scheme Authority (NAPSA)
to commission a feasibility study on the extension of social security coverage to smallholder farmers and casual
agriculture workers in the informal economy. The report outlined potential benefit packages and innovative delivery
modes that would be attractive and affordable for rural smallholder population. These packages were tested through
focus group discussions with potential farmers, and NAPSA together with ILO are planning an exercise to pilot the
packages identified and found appealing by the potential small holder farmers. The FMM supported the country
office to undertake a qualitative assessment of the Food Security Pack (FSP) and a subsequent consultancy to develop
a Pilot Project Proposal to address the findings of the assessment. The assessment was part of FAO’s response to
a request from the Government for an impact assessment and as part of efforts to strengthen the Livelihoods and
Empowerment pillar of the National Social Protection Policy.

CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT

•	

In Lebanon, 15 staff from the Ministry of Agriculture were trained in the utilization of the farmer registry, and 458
farmers were involved in the registration activities over six training days.

•	

In Zambia, in an effort to strengthen policy development processes, FAO together with ILO trained members of the
Simulations Technical Working Group on the local-economy-wide simulation modeling and its applications in the
context of policy-scenario simulations for the major agricultural and social protection programmes in Zambia.

POLICY ADVICE

•	

Thanks to the different activities supported by this project, the Minister of Agriculture of Lebanon officially announced
that expanding social protection to farmers, especially to small-scale family farmers, small-scale fisheries and workers
in both sectors, is a clear priority for the Government.

•	

In Lesotho, FAO and UNICEF jointly organized a dissemination workshop in Maseru on 13 September 2018 to provide
the main results of the CGP plus SPRINGS impact evaluation and related policy implications concerning the future of
complementary agricultural interventions for social protection beneficiaries. The main messages and policy advices
were reported in a policy brief and in a qualitative analysis report. The results of this evidence is feeding into policy
discussions of Government and other partners’ efforts to scale up integrated, multi-sector interventions for poverty
reduction and food security in Lesotho.

•	

In Mali, a policy brief on an integrated social protection and productive support package in Mali was elaborated as a
result of the related study conducted in partnership with the Institut de Recherches et d’Applications des Méthodes de
développement. The policy brief will be shared and validated with the Government of Mali (DNPSES/MSAH) and the
Institut.

•	

In Zambia, FAO developed a concept note describing an approach to facilitating policy dialogue on the role of
agriculture in reducing poverty in the country. This concept note will inform advocacy work on the policy reform
options FAO has proposed, based on which various studies were conducted and policy briefs produced. At the
request of the Ministry of Finance, FAO shared with the Ministry a brief on the studies undertaken by FAO and the
policy implications of the findings of those studies, to feed policy processes around integrated approaches to poverty
reduction.

CATALYTIC EFFECTS

•	

In Lebanon, the Government of Lebanon is now prepared to scale up the farmer registry at national level through
the implementation of the European Union–MADAD-funded project. The Farmer registry will be used for identifying
vulnerable and poor rural populations targeted in the project, as well as for expanding the coverage of social
protection to farmers (social security and National Poverty Targeting Program). It also paves the way for a stronger
coherence between agriculture and social protection in Lebanon in order to improve the impact of Government
interventions on rural poverty reduction and resilience.

•	

In Lesotho, FAO is now recognized as a reliable and influential partner in the social protection agenda. Currently, there
is a discussion among the Government and other country stakeholders about the Community Development Model
shaped by the Government and its implementation via the Livelihood Programme funded with a World Bank loan.
FAO was invited into these policy discussions and was proposed to consider the opportunity of leading a new impact
evaluation of this new Livelihood Programme.

•	

In Zambia, FAO joined the UNJP programme in March 2018 and is currently leading the work to support the
Livelihoods and Empowerment pillar of the programme. As a result of its membership under the joint programme,
FAO is also supporting the Smart Zambia Institute, which is developing a management and information system coined
the Zambia Integrated Social Protection Information System on behalf of the Ministry of Community Development
and Social Services. This is a process building on the experience and relationship that FAO has developed with the
Smart Zambia Institute during the development and implementation of the similar national agricultural management
information system titled the Zambia Integrated Agriculture Management Information System.

CROSS-SECTORAL WORK

•	

The importance of social protection integration in the agriculture sector (crop, animal, forestry, fisheries and others)
has been better pronounced through the project activities internally within MoA at central and local levels and a
dialogue was initiated with external partners and local authorities on expanding social protection to rural areas, thus
reducing poverty.

GENDER

111

•	

Gender considerations have been one of the priority areas in terms of data collection and analysis, policy and strategy
development, and all other programme intervention areas. Analytical work included in both outputs focused on
collecting disaggregated data and assess how the combination of interventions affect men and women and how
gender constraints may differentially affect women and men’s access to social security and distribution of benefits
within a household.

•	

Progress has been made to unlock the potential of women in the four targeted countries, and there is now a greater
awareness of the important role rural women play in social protection-related issues.

Annexes

-----------------------Page 128 End-----------------------

INNOVATION

•	

In Lesotho, the laboratory experiment represented an innovation allowing to disentangle the effects of the
programmes on risk attitudes by means of incentivized decisions. The data collected through the experiments helped
to further understand whether social protection programmes and broader community-development interventions
affect individual preferences toward risk and, as a consequence, livelihood strategies from low-return/low-risk
activities towards high-return/high-risk activities.

CHALLENGES IN PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND LESSONS LEARNED
•	

In Lebanon, one of challenges that delayed the design phase included the integration of social protection
considerations into the agriculture sector by itself and building linkages with external partners.

•	

In Zambia, a local firm was contracted to carry out data collection for an initial period of three months. However
due to bad weather conditions and low farmers attendance the data collection was delayed and could not meet the
deadline. Accessing auxiliary information for evidence-generation purposes (sample frames and cost of programmes,
amongst others) has also been a challenge.

FMM GENERAL PRINCIPLES AND EFFECTS
PARTNERSHIPS

•	

A partnership between SPC (SDD) and FAO’s Statistics Division (ESS), SAP on standardization of Household Income
and Expenditure Surveys in PICS introduced better designed consumption modules in the survey. A partnership
between SPC (FAME), FAO SAP, WorldFish and the PacFish project was established based on common interests on
work on fisheries and aquaculture and gender/equity concerns. Similarly, under the work on ‘Fish in Food Systems in
the Pacific’, a regional partnership between SPC (FAME), FAO SAP and the PacFish/Pathways project was established
and also connects to the University of Wollongong (ANCORS), which produces work on coastal fisheries and climate
change. A partnership between SPC (FAME), FAO SAP and WorldFish was developed and strengthened through this
work.

•	

A new partnership with Caribbean Regional Fisheries Mechanism and FAO SAP was built, which will result in
coordinated activities in new projects on FAD fisheries in both regions, to commence in 2019. In addition, partnerships
were established between the countries visited (Barbados, Dominica and Grenada) and the countries of origin of the
fishers (Cook Islands, Samoa, Tonga and Vanuatu). This partnership will hopefully be continued through a reverse
exchange of fishers under the above-mentioned projects.

•	

Through the work on ‘fish in food systems in the Pacific’ a partnership developed with the University of Wollongong
(ANCORS).

•	

New Partnerships with the Fisheries Agency of the Marshall Islands was also established through the nearshore FADs
impact evaluation activities.

•	
•	

Experts from USDA shared their agriculture-census experiences, including from US territories, with PICs.
SPC and FAO discussed the line of collaboration on improvement of survey tools and analysis of the related
information, and synergies that can emerge from respective activities related to strengthening country capacities to
monitor SDGs.

CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT

115

•	

Capacity-development training activities were conducted for a total of 143 farmers, extension workers and private
business representatives on planning and implementing contract-farming operations in Fiji, Solomon Islands, Tonga
and Vanuatu.

•	

Countries’ understanding of the 21 SDG indicators which FAO is custodian for were enhanced through a regional
training workshop; 26 representatives of national statistics offices and ministries of agriculture from ten member
countries in the Pacific, plus representatives of regional organizations were made aware of the 21 SDG indicators.

•	

Nationals from ten Pacific Island countries were made aware of the World Programme for the Census of Agriculture
2020, and four countries already indicated their commitment to carrying out the Census in the next two years.

•	

Two countries have been acquainted with the tools and methodologies developed by FAO to monitor SDG Target 2.1
indicators, including recently released e-learning courses on SDGs 2.1.1 and 2.1.2, which will allow them to further
understand the theoretical considerations behind the indicators.

•	

The respective staff of the NSOs in Solomon Islands and Tonga recognized the need for enhancing national capacities
for utilizing the tools and methodologies to be able to perform analyses locally and move away from strong reliance
on international or regional institutions to perform the analysis on their behalf.

•	

Fisheries staff in the Marshall Islands and Samoa are now able to develop and conduct fisheries household socioeconomic surveys using software on tablets.

•	

Capacities of communities and government staff in Samoa involved in the commercialization of breadfruit were
enhanced through study tours on marketing, growing, post-harvest management, harvesting and value addition were
enhanced.

-----------------------Page 132 End-----------------------

POLICY ADVICE

•	

The analysis of constraints and opportunities for small-scale tuna fisheries has provided areas of focus for regional
and national policies on promotion of and support to small-scale fisheries.

•	

The case studies on the impacts of nearshore FADs in the Marshall Islands and Samoa will help inform national
fisheries policies including the effectiveness of their respective FAD programmes. In addition, the case studies will
contribute to regional understanding of best practices for FADs.

•	

The feasibility study carried out in Samoa on breadfruit commercialization has provided recommendations for the
government to consider in progressing their ambitions to enhance commercialization of breadfruit in the country.

CATALYTIC EFFECTS

•	
•	

National capacities were enhanced in SDG monitoring, especially Goal 2, thus providing evidence for nutrition policies.

•	

More and more private-sector businesses are aware and have shown interest in signing contract contracts with
potential farmers.

•	

A Working Group to focus on specific statistical challenges of Pacific Island States created under APCAS within the
leadership of Fiji and Tonga. The group’s Terms of Reference are wide and cover many aspects.

•	

The results and the lessons learned from the workshop in Tonga will serve as basis to draft a Technical Cooperation
Program on assisting Pacific Island Countries to report on the SDGs and align their own national monitoring
programme to the 2030 Agenda.

•	

The peer-to-peer exchange with the Caribbean has led to the development of a new regional project on nearshore
FAD fisheries. The exchange will be repeated in the reverse direction through the latter FAO SAP project and a
Caribbean project.

•	

The contract farming trainings in Tonga has led to interest from the government to look into the possibility of
developing a contract farming bill.

The workshop on gender and fisheries instigated a new partnership to take the draft toolbox further and develop a
regional training session.

CROSS-SECTORAL WORK

•	

The side event on the ‘Regional Framework for Accelerating Action on Food Security and Nutrition in Pacific SIDS’ as
the Pacific regions implementation framework for the Global Action Programme on Food and Nutrition Security in
SIDS highlighted the cross-sectoral nature of food security and nutrition.

GENDER

•	

A specific tool was designed to assist those working on fisheries and aquaculture to better integrate gender and equity
considerations into their work.

•	

The fisheries household socio-economic surveys from the case studies on nearshore FADs in the Marshall Islands and
Samoa focused on gender-disaggregated data to identify the role of gender in marine recourse use and consumption
at the local level.

•	

Women’s group skills in breadfruit value addition and managing post-harvest losses were enhanced in Samoa in line
with the government’s wish to commercialize breadfruit at a larger scale in the country.

INNOVATION

•	

From the Census-related interventions under the project, the use of new technologies for field date capture and
compilation drew attention and participants noted the advantages and disadvantages. In the region, Tonga and
Vanuatu used CAPI in 2016 in their Population Census and “Mini Census”, respectively, while Samoa has applied this
method in few household surveys and intends to use it in the Agricultural Census 2019. Fiji used CAPI for its 2017 PHC.

•	

The case studies on contribution of nearshore FADs to food security in Samoa continues to innovate as it builds upon
the work of other regional partnerships to adapt and adjust methodologies for data collection and communication
materials to suit the environment and needs of SIDS.

•	

The e-learning courses on SDGs 2.1.1 and 2.1.2., as well as two main tools developed by the FAO Statistics Division
(ADePT-FSM and RM. Weight) were introduced during the workshop in Tonga and whenever technology allowed,
participants had the opportunity to practise the use of the tools.

CHALLENGES IN PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND LESSONS LEARNED

117

•	

The time constraint (of one year) was not feasible for the implementation of the proposed activities, especially in the
Pacific sub-region, where implementation is extremely slow due to geographical distances between islands.

•	

The time it takes to discuss and agree on roles and responsibilities among partners was long, given the capacities in
the Pacific and also the communication difficulties prevalent in these dispersed islands.

1 January 2017–31 May 2018

IMPLEMENTATION Benin, Cameroon, Chad, Côte d’Ivoire, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ghana, Kenya, Mali,
Mozambique, Rwanda and Zambia
COUNTRIES:

PROJECT RESULTS
•	

A total of 39 extension officers and lead farmers from 11 countries attended a three-week practical training
programme at the Songhai Centre in Benin in March 2018, with a view towards building their capacities in integrated
agricultural systems.

•	

An assessment was conducted on the impact of FAO-funded training courses offered by Songhai from 2016 to 2018 in
order to identify ways to make the training activities more effective and cost efficient.

•	

A mentorship programme for Small and Medium Agricultural Enterprises (SMAEs) was conducted following the
agribusiness training courses implemented in 2017. The 50 SMAEs underwent a mentorship programme implemented
in partnership with the African Agribusiness Incubator Network (AAIN).

•	

Appraisal of Public-private partnerships (PPPs): in response to the request from the African Union Commission (AUC)
for FAO to support the development of a framework to guide African governments in the design, implementation and
monitoring of PPPs in the agricultural sector, appraisals of PPPs were completed in Côte d’Ivoire, Ghana, South Africa
and Zambia, and a regional workshop was held to validate the findings and agree on next steps.

CONTRIBUTION TO FAO RESULTS

•	

The activities implemented under the project contribute to the following results under corporate Output Indicator
4.2.1: (i) Continental Public–Private Partnership (PPP) framework for agribusiness developed in support of the African
Union; and (ii) Capacity of regional agribusiness incubation and mentorship organizations such as AAIN strengthened
through South–South and Triangular Partnerships, including with DPS.

FMM GENERAL PRINCIPLES AND EFFECTS
PARTNERSHIPS

•	

The project benefited from partnerships with a number of institutions which have expertise in a broad range of
functions essential to the efficient operation of agricultural value chains. Market Matters Inc. and IFDC brought
business management and entrepreneurship skills to SMAEs. The AAIN network is currently conducting a mentorship
programme for the SMAEs trained by the project. The African Rural and Agricultural Credit Association (AFRACA),
through their network, brought in financial institutions that support lending to the agro–enterprise sector. The Boulder
Institute of MicroFinance shared tools and methodologies to build capacity of financial institutions to analyze and
finance agribusiness proposals. The African Union Commission remains a key partner in all FAO projects in the Africa
region as it provides overall strategic guidance on the development of the agricultural sector.

CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT

•	

Thirty-nine extension officers and lead farmers from 11 countries attended a three-week practical training programme
at the Songhai Centre in Benin in March 2018.

•	

Business mentorship was provided to 50 SMAEs.
Flexible Multi-Partner Mechanism Annual Report 2018

-----------------------Page 135 End-----------------------

POLICY ADVICE

•	

The project engaged the private sector in policy-making processes and policy implementation due to their critical role
in investing in the agricultural sector.

CATALYTIC EFFECTS

•	

Significant interest has been generated in the agribusiness training courses for SMAEs, which FAO organized jointly
with Market Matters Inc. Strategies for scaling up this kind of training need to be explored because there are few
such courses being offered in Africa and those that exist can provide training opportunities for only a tiny fraction of
SMAEs.

CROSS-SECTORAL WORK

•	

The project addressed agriculture as part of a broader food-system approach, going beyond specific sectoral issues
and focusing on how agriculture, trade and food security are affected by policies developed by other sectors.

•	

Within FAO, a number of divisions at headquarters and at regional and country levels collaborated in the
implementation of this project. The project cuts across three of FAO’s Strategic Objectives (SOs 2, 3 and 4) and
involved a multi-disciplinary team including experts in trade, agribusiness, agricultural production, natural resource
management and social protection.

GENDER

•	

The project tried as much as possible to ensure equitable participation of men and women in all activities. However,
this was often not possible as women are less represented in many of the areas targeted by the project. It appears
that in the younger generation, at least in certain sectors, such as private-sector and agro–enterprise development,
women are participating more actively and in greater numbers. This was evident in the agribusiness courses for
SMAEs, where women played a prominent role and overall female participation was 36 percent. However, in other
spheres, notably in public-sector high-level policy-making positions, men still dominate and it is therefore difficult to
promote female participation in project activities when the selection criteria are based on rank and seniority.

INNOVATION

•	

This project placed emphasis on SMAE development, because it is the SMAEs that can create the backward
and forward linkages within the agricultural value chain and stimulate value addition, commercialization and
transformation of the agricultural sector. Many SMAEs are owned or managed by young people, who by their nature
are innovative and open to the adoption of new technologies and new business approaches.

•	

The work on policy coherence between the ministries of agriculture and trade was also a significant innovation.
Agriculture and trade are closely interlinked, especially on the African continent where agricultural products constitute
the bulk of traded goods. However, in practice, there is poor coordination and collaboration between sector ministries
and this leads to distorted and incoherent policies, which hamper agricultural trade. Fostering dialogue and
coordination between sector ministries can significantly improve the enabling environment for trade and agribusiness.

•	

This project promoted agribusiness public–private partnerships (PPPs) by providing governments with practical
guidance on the design and implementation of PPPs that will contribute to inclusive agricultural growth. Agri-PPPs
are a particular priority for the African Union Commission which recognizes FAO’s leadership in this area and has
requested support to develop a PPP framework for its member countries.

CHALLENGES IN PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND LESSONS LEARNED
Challenges

•	

•	 The project time frame was very short in which to implement and coordinate a set of joined-up activities that
often required correct sequencing to be effective. For example, the agribusiness mentorship programme could only
begin after the agribusiness training activities had been completed.

•	

•	 It also takes time to build trust, buy-in and ownership by stakeholders and beneficiaries. In some cases, the
project was ready to implement, but stakeholders were not, and time was needed to hold consultations, explain the
expected benefits and obtain trust. Time is also required to evaluate the results of the various activities, learn lessons
and assess impact.

Lessons learned

•	
119

Reliance on a large number of partners also carries some risks and drawbacks. Some partners proved to be more
reliable and effective than others. This will be noted for future engagements.

FMM GENERAL PRINCIPLES AND EFFECTS
PARTNERSHIPS

•	

Main partnerships established and/or consolidated under the project in 2018, including with UNITAR and ACTIA.

CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT

•	

In partnership with ACTIA one training on food processing and food hygiene was delivered to beneficiary women
associations and cooperatives in Ethiopia.

•	

A training on Gender-Sensitive Value Chain development was developed and translated into an e-learning course
available on the e-learning platform of UNITAR.

POLICY ADVICE

•	

The project developed and supported the development of policies for food waste reduction, mainly at national level.
This was done through research, participation in activities from the European Union–FUSIONS project and UNEP, as
well as the international conferences on FLEW reduction in 2015. The main research focuses on defining policies for
food recovery and redistribution.

Flexible Multi-Partner Mechanism Annual Report 2018

-----------------------Page 137 End-----------------------

CATALYTIC EFFECTS

•	

Through its support to the Save Food extensive communication and partnership programme, the FMM strongly
attracted and catalyzed the interest of many organizations and companies who initiated valuable contributions to the
Global FLW Reduction Initiative.

CROSS-SECTORAL WORK

•	

The work on FLW reduction was cross-sectoral from its onset. Both within FAO and among its external partners, the
project involved the sectors of agriculture, fisheries, agro–industries, retail, input supply and services provision. It also
involved the disciplines of food science and technology, natural resources, climate change, rural sociology and gender,
economics, nutrition, food security, food quality and safety, statistics and communications.

GENDER

•	

From its inception, the project had a specific focus on gender. In 2018, the FAO publication ‘Developing gendersensitive value chains – Guidelines for practitioners’ was finalized. Through this framework, a gender-lens has been
systematically adopted in analyzing, designing and implementing value chain interventions.

INNOVATION

•	

The project supported the development of a new methodology to assess food losses. The new methodology of field
case studies goes deeper in the complex subject matter of food losses, finds the symptoms, causes and reasons for
the causes of food loss, discloses interactions along the food supply chains, and above all assesses the feasibility of
solutions against the background reality of social structures, cultural habits, the climate and environment, and the
contribution to nutrition and food security.

December 2016–May 2018

IMPLEMENTATION
Bangladesh, Kenya and Peru
COUNTRIES:

PROJECT RESULTS
Output 1. Knowledge is generated on urban food system dynamics, through both quantitative and qualitative
analysis

•	

The Rapid Urban Food Systems Appraisal Tool (RUFSAT) was developed and tested in Dhaka (Bangladesh), Nairobi
(Kenya) and Lima (Peru).

•	

The food systems Multi-Stakeholders Platform was established in all three countries to support the RUFSAT
methodology with qualitative information.

•	

The spatial analysis (GIS) was added as part of the RUFSAT in two of the three countries.

Output 2. Food Systems Multi-Stakeholders platform (MSP) and Comprehensive food systems plans are developed
at city level.

•	

In each of the three cities, MSPs was created with the leadership of the Municipalities in the case of Nairobi and Lima,
and of the Ministry of Local Government in the case of Dhaka.

•	

Workshops involving various food systems stakeholders (producers association, retail market representatives, the
private sector and non-governmental organizations) involved in food-related issues were organized to develop a
common vision for the food-systems strategy.

•	
•	

The Food Charter in Lima was developed and signed by the MSP members.
The Development of the Food Systems Strategy has started in Lima and Nairobi. As at the end of 2018, in Nairobi a
complete draft of the document was developed with support of FAO.

Output 3. Institutions are supported to use new knowledge generation and programme design tools and
approaches to improve the urban food systems under their jurisdiction in terms of sustainability and
inclusiveness

-----------------------Page 139 End-----------------------

CONTRIBUTION TO FAO RESULTS

•	

40201: Multi-stakeholder-platforms were established in Nairobi and Lima. In Dhaka, the final workshop served to
confirm participation of key stakeholders, which will be instrumental for a follow-up long-term project starting in 2019.
Each multi-stakeholder has a core group of 10–12 persons from different institutions. The expanded platform has
more than 80 people (Lima).

•	
•	

40202: A pilot activity was foreseen in Lima on food waste management.
40203: The RUFSAT provided evidence for better support of value chain actors. The multi-stakeholder platform
exchanges included managerial support.

FMM GENERAL PRINCIPLES AND EFFECTS
PARTNERSHIPS

•	

New partnerships were created at the local level through the establishment of the Food Systems Multi-Stakeholders
Platform. In Nairobi, a partnership was built between the Nairobi County, FAO, UN-HABITAT and Mazingira Institute,
among others. In Lima, a partnership was established between Lima Municipality, the Urban Agriculture Platform, the
Local Gastronomy Association and the Lima Healthy Food Platform. All these partnerships create the basis for future
engagement of the Municipalities on food systems and mainstreaming food in their Agenda.

•	

FAO headquarters created a new partnership with the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Network for continuing food
systems planning and actions in Nairobi. This partnership, which consists of a policy facility model in the Municipality,
will continue at least until June 2019.

CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT

•	

More than 120 officials and stakeholders were trained in both Lima and Nairobi on the importance of integrating food
systems in local policy, plans and actions.

•	

Knowledge was generated on the RUFSAT methodology and its use for planning in both Lima and Nairobi.

POLICY ADVICE

•	

From 2016, FAO has supported Nairobi County on food-systems planning, promoting the shift from a sectorial
approach to a systemic, multi-stakeholders and multi-sectorial approach for addressing urban food-security
challenges. At the end of 2018, Nairobi County, with support from the FAO–C40 collaboration presented the first
complete draft of the food-system strategy.

CATALYTIC EFFECTS

123

•	

The project was the driver for raising additional funds. The following initiatives were undertaken. Seed funds for
Technical Advisors on the Food Systems MSP and the Food Systems Strategy (two experts for Nairobi and one for
Dhaka). In Lima, the project “Establishing a composting center for managing the solid waste management from the
urban retail market” is currently under negotiation.

•	

In Dhaka, a proposal to follow up on the NADHALI project was successful in raising USD 12.5 million for a five-year
project (from Dutch Government funds).

•	

In Nairobi, a project was to start in 2019 with Italian Government funds to put in operation many of the actions
recommended in the food-system strategy. In addition, the USD-2.1-million, three-year project will include Kisumu
County.

•	

In Lima, additional funds through a TCP and MDF were obtained at the end of 2018 that will also promote good local
food governance mechanisms based on experiences of NADHALI.

•	

In Douala, Cameroon, seed funding was invested deriving from an explicit interest of the Municipality to apply the
“NADHALI” approach, and a Food Liaison Advisory Group, a multi-stakeholder platform that supports the Municipality,
was formed.

•	

At RAP, an agreement was signed at the end of 2018 between FAO and the World Bank (USD 350 000) to develop a
first-phase study for generating knowledge that will serve to eventually select cities where good local food governance
will be promoted.

Annexes

-----------------------Page 140 End-----------------------

CROSS-SECTORAL WORK

•	

In Lima, the Development of the Food Systems Strategy created interconnections with other non-food sectors, such
as the existing urban planning systems, climate change and risk management. In Nairobi, the Food Security Strategy is
going to prioritize more interconnection with water, land-use planning and health. In Dhaka, the entry point, or aspect
to prioritize in the initial phase, will be food safety but will be quietly associated with efforts to improve logistics and
resilient systems, all deriving from a cross-sectoral approach.

GENDER

•	
•	

In Nairobi and Lima, women represent 50 percent of the MSP members and core group.

•	

The gender balance was carefully considered for the RUFSAT survey.

Capacity building included about 50–70 food systems stakeholders and in all the organized workshops more than half
are women.

INNOVATION

•	

The project was innovative in the establishment of the Food Systems MSP that can advocate and advise to create a city
environment toward food security and nutrition, a mechanism which only a few cities in developing countries have
developed.

•	

The project stimulated the geo-referenced data collection for developing spatial analysis that has been recognized
crucial in the heterogeneous context of a city, often including informal settlements with limited access to quality food.

•	

The project promoted the shift from a sectorial approach to a more systemic, multi-stakeholder and multi-sectorial
approach.

CHALLENGES IN PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND LESSONS LEARNED
Challenges

•	
•	

The main challenge was the short time for achieving the expected results in one year.
Designing a rapid assessment methodology for complex systems is a real challenge. A shift from a quantitative
approach to more qualitative is desirable if the methodology has to be rapid.

Lessons learned

•	

Building ownership at political and technical level and promoting the multi-stakeholders engagement is key for the
success and sustainability of the interventions.

•	

Even if the local governments are recognized crucial players, there are contexts where the decentralization process is
weak and the National Government needs to be considered the key player.

•	

Considering that the interested local governments have never considered food systems in their agenda before, the
promotion of exchange between cities is essential. The city-to city exchange should be an integral part of any urban
food systems future projects.

Morocco, Myanmar, Zambia and Zimbabwe
COUNTRIES:

PROJECT RESULTS
Output 1 Policies and Strategies for reducing food loss and waste (FLW)

•	

With a view to helping the countries develop policies and strategies for FLW reduction, the project conducted a
training workshop on food loss assessment in Kenya, and developed indicators and an M&E framework for FLW
reduction in the country.

•	

In Zambia and Zimbabwe, residual activities for food loss assessment were conducted, contributing to the evidence on
which to base the formulation of policies and strategies.

•	

A regional training-of-trainers (ToT) on food loss assessment was conducted in Cameroon for the benefit of
participants from Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Côte d’Ivoire and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, building capacity
in these countries in food loss assessment, on which policies and strategies are based.

CONTRIBUTION TO FAO RESULTS

•	

Output 40201 – Public-sector organizations’ capacities are strengthened to design and implement national policies,
strategies, regulatory frameworks and investments plans supportive of inclusive and efficient agricultural and food
systems development.

•	

The project contributed to Indictor 40201, with support provided to four countries (Cameroon, Kenya, Zambia and
Zimbabwe).

FMM GENERAL PRINCIPLES AND EFFECTS
PARTNERSHIPS

•	

In general, in all the beneficiary countries the project allowed expanding the range of partners beyond the Ministries
responsible for primary production in the agriculture, fisheries and livestock sectors, to include others covering postproduction issues and aspects, such as trade, infrastructure, finance and investments. Partnerships were developed
with these Ministries (at policy level and with technical staff), universities and value-chain actors including farmers,
traders and processors. This shows that reduction of food losses is a multi-disciplinary, multi-stakeholder initiative
that requires support from a broad spectrum of stakeholders if it is to succeed.

•	

A strong partnership was developed with the African Union Commission because this project is providing assistance in
the assessment of food loss reduction against the Malabo Declaration targets.

CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT

•	

125

As a result of work started in 2017, about 65 people were trained in food-loss assessment in Kenya, Zambia and
Zimbabwe. These included extension staff, students, farmers and other value-chain actors and NGOs.

Annexes

-----------------------Page 142 End-----------------------

POLICY ADVICE

•	

The loss assessment studies conducted provide the base to underpin policies in the beneficiary countries.

CATALYTIC EFFECTS

•	

The FMM project’s activities in Africa stimulated complementary funding from the Rockefeller Foundation and the
regular programme through RAF’s Regional Initiative 2. This helped to create a linkage between country-level food
loss reduction strategies and programmes to the African Union’s Malabo Declaration and the target of halving of postharvest losses by 2025.

CROSS-SECTORAL WORK

•	

No information available.

GENDER

•	

In Cameroon, Kenya, Zambia and Zimbabwe, women have participated actively in all activities and a special effort was
made by the project to ensure their inclusion. The majority of post-harvest activities in Africa are the responsibility of
women, so it is important that they are adequately represented.

INNOVATION

•	

In Sub-Saharan Africa, country-level activities are being innovatively linked to regional priorities and targets set within
the African Union’s Malabo Declaration. This is the first time that a mechanism is being created for country-level
results to be channeled to the regional level to enable measurement of progress against regional targets on reduction
of food losses.

•	

The project involved further use of a case study methodology for assessing the causes, magnitude of losses and
solutions to address them. The publication “Status Report on Critical Loss Points and Underlying Causes of Food
Losses in Selected Crop Supply Chains in Developing Countries” will serve as a basis for streamlining the methodology.

National-level expertise on FLW issues such as food loss measurement was noted to be very low in some countries.
This problem led to envisaged activities being delayed and slow in Kenya and Cameroon. A strong and committed
country focal point is essential in coordinating and managing activities at country-level, while sufficient international
expertise and support missions are needed to develop the capacity for both national experts and national institutions.
Language is an issue and more efforts are needed to provide adequate support to francophone countries in order to
build their expertise.

PROJECT RESULTS
Output 1. Improved capacity to generate and use evidence for trade policy analysis, trade policy development and
trade negotiations

•	

In 2017, the project facilitated two e-learning courses to participants from eastern and southern African countries, and
one regional dialogue as a follow-up to the first e-learning course was organized combining the e-learning with a faceto-face training. Then 18 of the course participants took part in this dialogue. Following up on these activities, a second
regional dialogue was held on 29 January 2018 as a follow-up to the second e-learning course.

Output 2. Coherent development of agricultural trade policies and improved design of agriculture and food
security strategies and investment plans building on synergies between agriculture and trade planning processes
and related institutions.

127

•	

In 2017, four studies on coherence of agricultural and trade policies were prepared in Mozambique, the United
Republic of Tanzania, Zambia, and Zanzibar (United Republic of Tanzania), and national dialogues were held to validate
these reports with the participation of stakeholders from the government, the private sector, academia, donors
from both trade and agriculture. During these dialogues, priority areas were identified for the preparation of project
proposals/concept notes in Mozambique, the United Republic of Tanzania and Zambia.

•	

In 2018, the project proposals were completed and were presented to the national stakeholders both in bilateral
meetings and in dialogue events. Dedicated meetings were held in Mozambique (19 April 2018), the United Republic of
Tanzania (17 April 2018) and Zambia (6–7 March 2018). In all three cases, the government stakeholders validated the
project proposals.

•	

A report titled “Policy coherence for agricultural transformation in African least developed countries (LDCs)” was
published in 2018.

CONTRIBUTION TO FAO RESULTS
The project directly contributed to output 4.2. Concerning results that have been inserted in PIRES, the project contributed
to the following activities:

•	

•	

•	

52180 (United Republic of Tanzania): As part of an FAO project on trade-related capacity development for food
security and nutrition in eastern and southern Africa, a project proposal that would strengthen collaboration between
agriculture and trade stakeholders, namely the Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of Trade, was developed.
This was validated by all relevant stakeholders in the fields of trade and agriculture in a dialogue meeting that was
organized in the United Republic of Tanzania. A dialogue event was also organized in the United Republic of Tanzania,
Zanzibar. Through this effort, the capacity of the stakeholders to design aligned agriculture and trade policies and to
incorporate trade objectives into agricultural investment plans was enhanced (Qualifier 1). This was done through
a dialogue event that involved all the relevant stakeholders, and as such Qualifier 3 was fully achieved. The country
took ownership of the process that led to the development of the project proposal, and as such the provided support
increased the generation and uptake of knowledge on the incorporation of trade into agricultural investment plans
(Qualifier 5). An effort was made to involve and engage more women from among the stakeholders in this exercise
(Qualifier 6). Qualifiers 2 and 4 are not relevant, as the focus of this exercise was on the policy development side and
not on analytical studies and sector review (Qualifier 2) or standard setting (Qualifier 4).
52181 (Zambia): As part of an FAO project on trade-related capacity development for food security and nutrition in
Eastern and Southern Africa a project proposal that would strengthen collaboration between agriculture and trade
stakeholders, namely the Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Livestock, the Ministry of Commerce and the Zambia
National Cassava Association was developed. This was validated by all relevant stakeholders in the fields of trade and
agriculture in a dialogue meeting that was organized in Zambia. Through this effort, the capacity of the stakeholders to
design aligned agriculture and trade policies and to incorporate trade objectives into agricultural investment plans was
enhanced (Qualifier 1). This was done through a dialogue event that involved all relevant stakeholders, and as such
Qualifier 3 was fully achieved. The country took ownership of the process that led to the development of the project
proposal, and as such the provided support increased the generation and uptake of knowledge on the incorporation
of trade into agricultural investment plans (Qualifier 5). An effort was made to involve and engage more women from
among the stakeholders in this exercise (Qualifier 6). Qualifiers 2 and 4 are not relevant as the focus of this exercise
was on the policy development side and not on analytical studies and sector review (Qualifier 2) or standard setting
(Qualifier 4).
52178 (Mozambique): As part of an FAO project on trade-related capacity development for food security and nutrition
in Eastern and Southern Africa, a project proposal that would strengthen collaboration between agriculture and trade
stakeholders was developed. This was validated by all relevant stakeholders in the fields of trade and agriculture in
a dialogue meeting that was organized in Mozambique. These stakeholders were the ministries of agriculture, trade
and fisheries, and provincial authorities responsible for agricultural data collection and analysis. Through this effort,
the capacity of the stakeholders to design aligned agriculture and trade policies and to incorporate trade objectives
into agricultural investment plans was enhanced (Qualifier 1). This was done through a dialogue event that involved
all relevant stakeholders, and as such Qualifier 3 was fully achieved. The country took ownership of the process that
led to the development of the project proposal, as such the provided support increased the generation and uptake
of knowledge on the incorporation of trade into agricultural investment plans (Qualifier 5). An effort was made to
involve and engage more women from among the stakeholders in this exercise (Qualifier 6). Qualifiers 2 and 4 are
not relevant as the focus of this exercise was on the policy development side and not on analytical studies and sector

FMM GENERAL PRINCIPLES AND EFFECTS
PARTNERSHIPS

•	

The project was implemented in collaboration with the Trade Policy Training Centre in Africa (TRAPCA). With regard
to policy advice, the project was implemented in collaboration with the Enhanced Integrated Framework and the
European Centre for Development Policy Management. In 2018, both institutions contributed to the preparation of the
three project proposals through reviewing drafts and offering recommendations.

CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT

•	

The project has a very strong component of capacity development with the two facilitated e-learning courses and
the face-to-face dialogues that followed their delivery. In this regard, the only activity of the project in 2018 was the
organization of the regional dialogue in Arusha, United Republic of Tanzania, where 17 course participants from
countries in Eastern and Southern Africa engaged in issues relevant to Agriculture in International Trade Agreements.
Flexible Multi-Partner Mechanism Annual Report 2018

-----------------------Page 145 End-----------------------

POLICY ADVICE

•	

This was the core element of the national-level activities of the project in Mozambique, the United Republic of
Tanzania and Zambia. The project supported countries to improve implementation of the trade agreements that they
are signatories to, including the WTO Agreement on Agriculture, the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa
(COMESA), the East African Community (EAC) and the Southern Arican Development Community (SADC).

•	

With regard to the national component on policy coherence, the project proposal in Mozambique was incorporated
by the government into the update of the country’s National Agricultural Investment Plan (NAIP). In addition, through
the collaboration with the Enhanced Integrated Framework, interest to further expand the work in other countries was
expressed.

CATALYTIC EFFECTS

•	

During the face-to-face meeting that was held in 2017, as a follow up to the delivery of the e-learning course, the
participants requested the creation of a network of practitioners that will continue their collaboration subsequent
to the work they have done on the course. This request was tested and confirmed at the second face-to-face
meeting held on 29 January 2018. FAO has already included in its activities assistance in developing the e-network in
partnership with the African Union and TRAPCA.

CROSS-SECTORAL WORK

•	

The project looked at agriculture as part of broader food systems, therefore going beyond the specific sectoral issues
and focusing on how agriculture, food security and nutrition are affected by the policies developed and implemented
by other sectors. In particular, the project focused on strengthening capacities to analyze and address the impacts
of trade and related policies and agreements, in an effort to facilitate a closer, more systematic and long-lasting
collaboration between the agriculture and trade ministries.

GENDER

•	

Gender considerations are implicit in the goals of the project, as the development of efficient domestic and regional
agricultural markets are expected to improve participation of smallholder farmers and farm family labour (mainly
women) in agricultural input, product and labour markets, thereby improving incomes and food security outcomes.

INNOVATION

•	

The project included blended e-learning and face-to-face training, through the regional dialogues held on 29 January
2018. Moreover, the creation of a network of experts which will progressively evolve into a neutral and independent
platform for knowledge and experience exchange among trade practitioners in the region is a significant follow-up of
the project. This idea was embraced by the participants in the two regional dialogues. The building of the platform,
which will include national and international actors, is expected to contribute to improving the quality of policy
analysis and to disseminate the knowledge and information facilitating regional trade.

CHALLENGES IN PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND LESSONS LEARNED
Challenges

•	

The extension of the project from 31 December 2017 to 31 May 2018 was decided at a late stage. This, in conjunction
with the delayed start of the project, reduced the available time and squeezed the activities within 2017.

Lessons learned

•	

129

If the extension of the project had been approved early enough, some of the activities could have been conducted in
2018 in a more efficient way.

Singapore, Thailand and Viet Nam
COUNTRIES:

PROJECT RESULTS
Output 1: Policies, regulatory frameworks and public goods enhance inclusiveness and efficiency of food,
agriculture and forestry systems

•	

In total, seven regional workshops were carried out. For Component 1 on Aquaculture Biosecurity, guidance was
provided in the following aspects: (1) development of the aquaculture component of country National Action Plans on
AMR within the One Health platform; (2) detailed steps in the design of antimicrobial use (AMU) and AMR surveys. For
Component 2 of Food Safety, guidance was provided on the following aspects: (1) inspection systems to include AMR
in fish-product sampling; (2) fish-product waste-management; and (3) utilization of fish silage (to reduce the need for
antimicrobials for treatment).

•	

Under Output 1, several documents were drafted and/or compiled in 2018. These include the following: (1)
Performance of antimicrobial susceptibility-testing programmes relevant to aquaculture and aquaculture products;
(2) Review of alternatives to antimicrobials in aquaculture (vaccines, phage therapy, quorum sensing, prebiotics,
probiotics and plant therapy); (3) Fisheries and Aquaculture Technical Paper on Understanding AMR in Aquaculture
(compendium of papers prepared by CA and experts presented during three regional AMR-in-aquaculture workshops
in 2017); (4) Best practice guidance for carp, tilapia and shrimp. These are additional project results.

Output 2: Capacities (knowledge and skills) of Competent Authorities and other stakeholders on prudent and
responsible use of antimicrobials in aquaculture developed and/or enhanced

•	

A total of 164 delegates from competent authorities and other stakeholder groups from 11 countries had improved
awareness, enhanced knowledge, better understanding of AMR, AMU, food safety and quality aspects, as well as
policy, laboratory and farm-level considerations. Communication campaigns were also carried out among aquaculture
professionals/producers and the general public (though bulletins, seminars, farm visits, and social media). All these
contributed to capacity-building of participating countries and other stakeholders.

FMM GENERAL PRINCIPLES AND EFFECTS
PARTNERSHIPS

•	

New partnerships were developed with Croatia (Croatia Veterinary Institute), India (Nitte University), Netherlands
(Wageningen University), Singapore (Agri–Food and Veterinary Authority), Thailand (Chulalongkorn University), USA
(Mississippi State University), European Commission, the Network of Aquaculture Centres in Asia-Pacific, MSD Animal
Health and City University of Hong Kong. These partnerships are important in terms of the following: (i) access to
new and additional resources, and they can be partners for joint mobilization endeavours; (ii) such alliances can give
a competitive edge and can assure quality products; (iii) an indicator of multi-stakeholder inclusiveness; (iv) the AMR
subject is quite complicated and involves many sectors, thus requiring a multi-disciplinary and integrated approach;
and (v) a strategic mechanism to achieve common goals and share costs.

•	

In 2018, the process for designation of the FAO Reference Center for Aquaculture Biosecurity (including AMR)
commenced. The candidate institutions are: (1) China (Yellow Sea Fisheries Research Institute and the Pearl River
Fisheries Research Institute; (2) India (Nitte University); (3) the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern
Ireland (the Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science, an executive agency of the Department for
Environment, Food and Rural Affairs); and (4) the United States of America (Mississippi State University).

CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT

•	

Capacity building was incorporated in almost all activities. It involved officials of competent authorities and other
representatives with guidance and facilitation from FAO in the actual development of survey questionnaires,
assessment methods, modules, extension materials and laboratory methods, as well as in the organization and
conduct of national and regional workshops and preparation of the aquatic component of country AMR NAPs.

POLICY ADVICE

•	

The project helped establish governance and policy dialogue mechanisms including: (i) creation of a Task Force,
Working Group and Steering Committee; (ii) multisectoral coordination meetings; (iii) more explicit contribution of
the aquatic component to the country National Action Plans; (iv) formalization of the National Action Plans on AMR;
(v) review of AMR-relevant legislation; and (vi) inspection of importer premises (veterinary medicine products and raw
material) to determine origin and use.

CATALYTIC EFFECTS

•	

A side event held during the Ninth Session of the FAO Sub-Committee on Aquaculture of the Committee on Fisheries
(COFI/SCA) (Rome, Italy, October 2017) represented the first formal AMR awareness-raising initiative that sensitized
fisheries and aquaculture authorities from 89 FAO Members, two associate Members, representatives from two
specialized UN agencies and observers from seven intergovernmental and six international non-governmental
organizations. Issues concerning AMR were also captured during the Sixteenth Session of the Sub-Committee on Fish
Trade (COFI/SCFT, September 2017), and in a number of scientific events and other important meetings (for instance
the Asia–Pacific Aquaculture Conference (Malaysia, July 2017); the 16th Meeting of the Advisory on Aquatic Animal
Health of the Network of Aquaculture Centeres in Asia–Pacific (August 2017).

CROSS-SECTORAL WORK

•	

In this project, participating countries were provided guidance in the development of the aquaculture component that
was eventually integrated into the National Action Plans on AMR under the One Health platform.

GENDER

•	

131

The project reflected high gender equality, in that 60 percent and 74 percent of participants, in the aquaculture health
and food safety components, respectively, were women.

Annexes

-----------------------Page 148 End-----------------------

INNOVATION

•	

The project stimulated interest in looking into alternatives to antimicrobials including phytogenics (plant-derived
compounds), dietary acidifiers, short-chain fatty acid, bacteriophage, probiotics and prebiotics, short-chain
carbohydrates, egg-yolk antibody (IgY), antimicrobial peptides, bioflocs technology, quorum sensing, green water
technology and specific-pathogen free technology. The future of vaccination particularly in the predominant Asian
aquaculture that has a low uptake of vaccine technology, was revisited, looking at, for example, multi-component
vaccines for complicated and multi-infection disease conditions, automated fish injectors, multivalent vaccines,
etc. Other innovations involve safer practices to integrate fish farming through new systems such as fish–flower,
fish–vegetables (aquaponics), fish–fruit trees, polyculture (shrimp–tilapia), shrimp–mangrove, rice–fish, rice–crayfish,
rice–shrimp and integrated multi-tropic aquaculture (IMTA). The fish-silage processing technology was introduced
to beneficiary countries giving them a new method using organic acid, simple and affordable technology and its
application as feed ingredient and/or fertilizer.

CHALLENGES IN PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND LESSONS LEARNED
Challenges

•	

Although the project’s EOD was January 2017, funds were made available only at the end of March. Considering a oneyear project implementation timeline, this was very tight.

PROJECT RESULTS
•	

As part of the project, FAO continued to provide support to the Agricultural Trade Expert Network in Europe and
Central Asia (ATEN) established in 2014; ATEN brings together experts who conduct research, carry out training
programmes and advise governments and the private sector on issues related to agricultural trade and trade
policy, including participation in regional and multilateral trade agreements. The aim is to (a) promote dialogue
on agricultural trade-policy issues and (b) support broader capacity development in this area. The Networks meets
annually to discuss the pressing agricultural trade issues and produces an annual publication “Review of Agri–Food
Trade Policies in the Post-Soviet Countries”.

•	

Flour producers from Central Asia participated in the KazGrain conference in Astana, Kazakhstan (16 March 2018)
and World Mill Tech, a global milling machinery and technology fair in Istanbul, Turkey (29 March–1 April 2018). Both
events served to exchange industry-specific knowledge and establish business relations for imports and exports.

FMM GENERAL PRINCIPLES AND EFFECTS
PARTNERSHIPS

•	

New partnerships were established with private-sector organizations: the National Union of Food Exporters of Russia,
Ukrainian Association of Honey Exporters and Processors of Honey (UAHEP) and the Union of Millers of Ukraine.
These associations were instrumental in delivering training and guidance on accessing markets to the beneficiary
organizations and acted as catalysts and coordinators of dialogues at the regional level.

CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT

•	

133

During the workshop on export promotion in Moscow, attended by 36 participants , reports were delivered and
presentations made that reflected the current situation and issues related to export promotion at the national level.
The workshop provided participants with information on the best practices of agri–food export promotion of several
European and Central Asian countries, including strategies and plans of agri–food export promotion, as well as the
role and place of various state organizations in the system of agri–food export promotion.

Annexes

-----------------------Page 150 End-----------------------

•	

Honey producers from Kyrgyzstan, Moldova and Tajikistan benefited from the one-day training organized by UAHEP,
where they learned about global honey market developments, sanitary barriers to trade, preparation for European
Union food safety audits and developing a honey traceability system for six producers from Moldova, Kyrgyzstan and
Tajikistan.

•	

The Union of Millers of Ukraine organized two training sessions in cooperation with the Grain Processors Union of
Kazakhstan and the Committee of Millers of the Union of Entrepreneurs of Kyrgyzstan.

•	

Technical support was provided to the Ministry of Agriculture of Georgia for the installation of the FPMA Tool.
Following deployment of the tool, the project delivered a one-day training workshop for technical staff of the Ministry
and other national stakeholders on how to use the FPMA Tool to perform basic price analyses. Participants from
the Ministry, the National Statistics Agency, and the International School of Economics of the Tblisi State University
attended the training.

•	

A similar training activity was also held under the project in early 2018 in Dushanbe, Tajikistan, following deployment
of the new version of the FPMA Tool. The training was attended by technical staff from the Agency of Statistics, the
Ministry of Agriculture and several other government and international agencies.

POLICY ADVICE

•	

The project activities fostered better understanding of the relevant provisions in trade agreements and the norms and
standards that apply in different markets with respect to agri–food exports from the region. Accession commitments
in agriculture assumed by the new WTO member states among the post-Soviet countries have implications for the
direction that agricultural policies can take.

CATALYTIC EFFECTS

•	

An FAO LoA with the Ukrainian Association of Honey Exporters and Processors clearly showed the potential of working
with the industry association in developing new markets; TCI then developed and signed a new technical assistance
project on export market development in Ukraine with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development to
cover additional sectors, including honey, in 2018.

•	

Knowledge obtained through e-learning, regional workshops and training for officials in Georgia will be used by
the Ministries of Trade and Agriculture in the process of implementation of WTO commitments and will allow them
to pursue their trade objectives in bilateral and multilateral settings. This, in turn, translates to more effective and
transparent application of agricultural trade rules for proper functioning of agri–food markets.

CROSS-SECTORAL WORK

•	

Not applicable/available.

GENDER

•	

Special consideration was given to encouraging participation of qualified women in the e-learning courses; 61.3
percent of participants who were accepted for the course were women.

INNOVATION

•	

The innovative approach used in the project was based on blended learning that included an e-learning course and
face-to-face training on related topics, which allowed greater interaction between the participants and in-depth
treatment of complex topics. These capacity development activities were supplemented by creating and strengthening
professional networks that will continue functioning after the project ends.

•	

To benefit honey producers, UAHEP prepared a draft concept for a traceability system for the benefit of the entire
industry. Today, every exporter of honey from Ukraine has its own traceability system, so there are no uniform
standards at the industry levels. The proposed concept includes technological solutions (online access, QR codes or
other) to minimize human error and improve reliability of the system. This online system can enhance the reputation
and credibility of Ukrainian honey exporters and producers. For example, the QR code can give consumers an
opportunity to obtain full information about the product and its origin, which can serve as an additional incentive for
producers to develop exports of packaged products.

•	

A new project with EBRD funding will start piloting an industry/association honey traceability system in Ukraine in
2018–2019.

CHALLENGES IN PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND LESSONS LEARNED
Challenges

•	

The implementation of the project started with a delay. The project was formulated and endorsed in September 2016
and the activities were designed to start immediately. However, the project became operational with the appropriate
Oracle code only in January 2017, leaving the team with less than 11 months for implementation (considering that the
closing date remained until the end as December 2017). This reduced the time that was available for the involvement
of the stakeholders at the country level and implementation of activities.

Lessons learned

135

•	

It is crucial to account, to the extent possible, for all risks to the project, including delays in FAO procedures, changes in
governments and insufficient human resources in national agencies to implement activities.

•	

The programmatic approach to project formulation and implementation that fosters synergies with ongoing FAO
activities has proven to be highly effective – the project outputs were closely linked to the Regional Initiative and
TCI projects, ensuring their successful implementation. Knowledge sharing and capacity development were rooted
in FAO’s expertise in the area of trade policy, investment projects in the region and partnerships with other UN
organizations and country stakeholders.

•	

The project demonstrated the strong need for information and capacity development in the area of agricultural export
promotion. To continue providing support to countries in this area, FAO has partnered with the International Trade
Center (ITC) through a Memorandum of Understanding and a UN interagency agreement for developing guidelines
and methodologies for inclusive agri–food system development and export promotion through multi-stakeholder
alliances.

Multisectoral analysis on antimicrobial resistance and its use in the livestock, hydrobiological and agricultural
production sectors. During 2018, one regional and six national reports were finalized. The documents were officially
delivered to national authorities of each country.
Preparation of two Concept Notes for regional projects on AMR risk assessment. The importance of AMR risk
assessment in the food production sector, and the innovative tool developed by the project, triggered the interest of
other countries in the region for technical assistance from FAO. It was possible to define strategies for a TCP project
and a project financed by the Norwegian Agency for Development (NORAD), which include the application of the risk
assessment tool. They will be implemented in 2019 in four Latin American and Caribbean countries.
Participation and follow-up to the coordination mechanism of activities on AMR at the level of the Tripartite
Alliance Plus in the region. Monthly meetings of coordination and participation in activities on AMR of the respective
agencies were achieved. A video for the presentation and promotion of the mission of the Tripartite Alliance in the
region was jointly prepared.Output 3. AMR risk management capabilities
Regional and Interagency Event on Gaps in Governance, Surveillance and Containment of AMR. The
participation of the six beneficiary countries, four invited countries and three international reference organizations
for AMR was achieved. Based on the assessed risk, the existing priority gaps were identified to mitigate AMR in each
sector. A preliminary analysis of the feasibility of the mitigation measures was made. A report of the meeting was
developed and distributed among participants.

Regional Workshop on AMR Awareness and Promotion of Good Practices for its Containment. Through a
working agreement with the Pan American Association of Veterinary Sciences (PANVET), the event was organized
with leading international experts, including the President of the World Veterinary Association. At this event, it was
possible to identify and prioritize the constraints and priorities for the adoption of good practices for AMR in the
agri–food systems of the region. Also a testimonial video was prepared (available at https://www.youtube.com/
watch?v=OHGx-puRDHY).
Regional Meeting of Experts on the use of Antimicrobials in Aquaculture in Latin America. The participation of
the eight main aquaculture producers in the region was achieved. The sanitary status of the animal populations, the
use of antimicrobials, and the generation of resistance of those food systems were analyzed. A technical report of the
activity is evidence of this activity.
Work plan for the FAO Regional Reference Laboratory for AMR. During March 2018, the regional project team met
with the authorities and technical teams of SENASICA (the National Service of Health, Safety and Agri–Food Quality
of Mexico), within the boundaries of the process of its designation as the FAO Reference Center for Resistance to
Antimicrobials. A work plan was developed, consolidating synergies between FAO and SENASICA through its official
laboratory, which will allow in the short and medium term to implement the actions of AMR containment in the
countries of the region.
Regional meeting advances in AMR risk management in the food production sector. In May 2018, the activity was
organized by the FAO project and SENASICA, with participation of the responsible officers for AMR in the agricultural
health services of 12 countries of the region. An in-situ evaluation of the advances in the design and implementation
of the National Action Plans on AMR was achieved. The definition of recommendations was achieved based on the
technical design of FAO’s global strategy for AMR.

CONTRIBUTION TO FAO RESULTS

•	

Given the nature of AMR, advancing AMR risk management enables the management of various risks related to animal
health, plant health and food safety, including those with an impact on human health. Therefore, the AMR approach
contributes to all the results related to the health and safety of food production systems, as well as to food security.

FMM GENERAL PRINCIPLES AND EFFECTS
PARTNERSHIPS

•	

During 2018, contact was made with a subsidiary of International Consumers with the objective of designing and
deploying a communication campaign on AMR. The communication pieces were developed by the project and
Consumers International and are aimed at raising consumer awareness and influencing decision makers.

CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT

•	

In total, 167 trainers trained in the main disciplines that require containment of AMR under the One Health approach
are registered.

POLICY ADVICE

•	

At the beginning of 2018, the project convened non-beneficiary countries with the objective of supporting the
definition of national AMR governance mechanisms. During 2018, the FAO RLC project received requests from
countries to support the strengthening of AMR governance. The coordination with the Pan American Health
Organization and WHO was established to provide an integrated response in 2019.

CATALYTIC EFFECTS

•	

137

The project strategy generated the formal request for FAO technical assistance on AMR from Plurinational State of
Bolivia, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Paraguay, Peru and Uruguay – countries that were not beneficiaries of the project.
Likewise, the six beneficiary countries asked FAO for the continuity of the actions, considering that the work
maintained high quality standards. The project brought forth many recommendations which require FAO technical
support for their implementation. The intervention on AMR awareness-raising established the basis for the formation
of a regional communications network for AMR. The professionals and technicians trained in the project replicated
the knowledge acquired to their national counterparts, using the tools designed by the project. Finally, the creation
of National AMR Committees and the formulation of National Action Plans are outstanding examples of catalytic
effects derived from the project. The strategic focus of the project to address AMR in the food production sector,
together with a high level of achievement of its indicators, has had a catalytic effect in positioning FAO in this area.
This is evidenced by the requests for technical assistance from the countries and the interest of funding agencies in
supporting the future implementation of projects.

CROSS-SECTORAL WORK

•	
•	

The project strategy advocates and consolidates the One Health approach, as a guiding principle.
FAO, as a multidisciplinary organization in the food and agriculture sector, is in a privileged position to contribute to
cross-sectoral work. Similarly, the project has reinforced the coordination between the Tripartite Alliance (FAO, OIE
and WHO), incorporating other regional organizations linked to AMR, allowing the growth of cross-sectoral work.

GENDER

•	

The project carried out a gender analysis during its formulation, considering the roles and responsibilities of men and
women who benefit directly or indirectly from the project. The gender indicator of the project corresponds to G-1: the
project, based on its technical intervention strategy, addresses gender equality in some of its dimensions.

•	

The project considered the inclusion of a gender perspective in the political and technical debate processes and the
improvement of the capacities related to the control of AMR, including the risk communication strategy developed by
the project.

INNOVATION

•	

The governance of the One Health approach requires innovation in the form of work by the institutions, as well as
in the professional training of the related disciplines. The project has developed methodologies and innovative tools
which until now are unique in the region and even in the world. A methodology for assessing the risks of AMR in
the livestock, agricultural and aquaculture sectors is highlighted, allowing the identification of priority gaps to guide
mitigation measures based on risk. This methodology has raised the interest for its future application in countries
of Africa and Asia. In addition, a methodological framework was formulated for the development of awareness and
advocacy strategies on AMR. Both methodologies will be very useful for the ministries of agriculture of the beneficiary
countries, as they develop their strategies to fight against AMR.

CHALLENGES IN PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND LESSONS LEARNED
Challenges

•	

The high volume and complexity of the activities defined in the project with an execution horizon of 14 months
evidenced at times the high load of administrative, operational and hierarchical processes required for the operation
of projects in the field. This situation introduces an additional burden for the technical and operational teams to
achieve an adequate level of compliance with the programming. The great dedication and commitment of the
operations unit, which was accompanied by technical coordination, meant that delays in the management of the
project had a low impact on the level of achievement of the project’s objectives. This experience demonstrates the
need to establish some simplified processes for the execution of field programmes and projects. In this way, it will be
possible to comply with government counterparts and maintain a level of competitiveness with other agencies that
implement technical assistance projects.

Lessons learned

•	

In the containment of AMR, it is crucial to continue the technical support in the beneficiary countries, as well as in the
rest of the region. The FMM project was successful in this respect. However, it requires continuity of actions to achieve
results in a more sustainable way. FAO’s work in the field is the main mechanism to maintain and increase its presence
and leadership as a technical cooperation agency.
