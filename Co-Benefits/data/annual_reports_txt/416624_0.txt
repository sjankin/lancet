Thomas Greminger, OSCE Secretary General, at a high-level event hosted by High Representative/Vice-President Federica Mogherini on Climate, Peace and Security: The Time for Action,
Brussels, 22 June 2018. (EEAS)

Message from the
Secretary General
Over the course of 2018, it became increasingly clear to me that the OSCE is needed now
more than ever. At a time when our security environment is more polarized, more unpredictable
and more unstable than it has been in decades, the OSCE has great potential to help reduce
tensions, rebuild trust and encourage co-operation on shared security concerns.
The past year saw plenty of worrying challenges to security in our region, including continued
conflicts, deteriorating internal situations in some states, and transnational threats like terrorism,
violent extremism, climate change, and trafficking in drugs, arms and people.
Unfortunately we also saw backsliding on commitments to human rights and fundamental
freedoms in some OSCE participating States. This reminds us that we must always remain
vigilant in defending our fundamental principles and commitments, which the Organization will
continue to support participating States in their implementation.

OSCE ANNUAL REPORT 2018

-----------------------Page 6 End-----------------------

But there were also some bright spots in 2018, including positive developments in Armenia,
the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and the Transdniestrian settlement process, and
growing regional co-operation in Central Asia. Such developments also present opportunities
for OSCE bilateral engagement and new openings for supporting regional approaches.
These also highlight that even after many years without progress, co-operation is still possible,
and that it can produce practical outcomes that reinforce security and stability. In particular, I
hope that progress on the Transdniestrian settlement process will encourage the sides in other
conflicts to take steps to improve conditions for ordinary people, which can help lay the ground
for a peaceful settlement. Security and humanitarian challenges are at the core of the Geneva
International Discussions, where the OSCE remains strongly committed to our role as a CoChair. We hope to see progress also in the Minsk Process working towards finding a peaceful
solution to the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict.
Achieving a peaceful and sustainable resolution to the crisis in and around Ukraine remains the
OSCE’s top priority. In 2018, the Organization continued to focus on de-escalating tensions on
the ground and facilitating the political process working toward a peaceful settlement.
After almost five years of conflict, the humanitarian situation in eastern Ukraine has continued
to deteriorate. The OSCE Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine – the SMM –facilitated more
than 1,200 localized ceasefires in 2018 to enable repairs to critical infrastructure serving people
on both sides of the line of contact. These and other SMM efforts to reduce the human cost of
the conflict make a tremendous difference for people in the conflict zone, but they also reflect
the failure of the sides to protect civilians. While the OSCE can help improve conditions for
people living in the conflict zone and facilitate the political process, it is the responsibility of the
sides to achieve sustainable peace.
Throughout 2018, I have strived to ensure that the OSCE is fully prepared to deal with today’s
critical security challenges. This includes working closely with the Chairmanship and Troika to
develop more coherent and co-ordinated approaches, and exploring ways to preserve and
strengthen the Organization’s flexibility and responsiveness in a constrained budgetary context.
The Secretariat has continued to improve its ability to provide strategic support to the
Chairmanship, Troika and participating States. We have also been looking at how we can
enhance the OSCE’s impact in the field, and more effectively integrate women and youth
across the three dimensions of our work. In addition, we have been studying how to reform the
Organization’s cumbersome budget process; attract and retain high-quality staff; make better
use of technology; and more effectively promote the OSCE and the impact of our work.
Leveraging partnerships also helps the Organization maximize its impact. In 2018, taking
political directions from the participating States, the Secretariat continued to enhance cooperation with other international and regional organizations, and to further operationalize
our relationship with the United Nations. Recognizing that security in the OSCE region is
tightly intertwined with security in neighboring regions, we have continued to strengthen our
engagement with our Mediterranean and Asian Partners for Co-operation.
I am grateful for the excellent co-operation we have had with the 2018 Italian OSCE
Chairmanship and with Troika members Austria and Slovakia. I would also like to thank all the
women and men who work in the OSCE Secretariat, institutions and field operations – they are
the engine that powers the OSCE and its efforts to strengthen security and stability throughout
our region.

OSCE Secretary General

CHAIRMANSHIP
The OSCE Chairmanship is selected by the OSCE
Ministerial Council for a one-year term. The post of
Chairperson-in-Office is held by the foreign minister
of the selected participating State.

Dialogue, Ownership, Responsibility

Chairperson-in-Office:
Angelino Alfano (from 1 January until 31 May), Enzo Moavero Milanesi (from 1 June until 31 December)
www.osce.org/chairmanship

Italy assumed the Chairmanship of the OSCE at a critical time for European security,
marked by growing distrust and antagonism among OSCE participating States. Conflicts
in the OSCE area, as well as evolving international crises unfolding within and beyond
its boundaries undermine the rules-based order in Europe and jeopardize attempts to
foster international co-operation, ever more needed to address new multifaceted and
transnational challenges to security. Along the lines of the motto “Dialogue, Ownership,
Responsibility”, and paying special attention to the link between European and EuroMediterranean security, the Italian Chairmanship focused on strengthening the multilateral
approach embodied by the OSCE, consistently seeking opportunities for dialogue in order
to jointly address these challenges.

(MFA Italy)

“In this historic phase, the OSCE remains a key bulwark of multilateralism and an indispensable tool for
constructing peace and security in Europe. To fully harness its potential and address the challenges
that we are all facing together, we need to be open to dialogue, show ownership and be ready to take
on our responsibilities.”
Enzo Moavero Milanesi
OSCE Chairperson-in-Office and
Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation of Italy

FOSTERING COMPREHENSIVE SECURITY
Conflicts in the OSCE area remained at the top of the
Organization’s agenda in 2018. The Chairmanship put the
crisis in and around Ukraine at the centre of its work, with
two high-level visits to Kyiv and eastern Ukraine by thenChairperson-in-Office Angelino Alfano (30–31 January)
and by Deputy Foreign Minister Guglielmo Picchi (26–
28 July), both focused on the impact of the crisis on the
civilian population and its destabilizing effects on the
overall security situation in the OSCE region. These visits
were followed by meetings with Russian Foreign Minister
S. Lavrov in Moscow by then-Chairperson-in-Office A.
Alfano (1 February) and Chairperson-in-Office Moavero
Milanesi (8 October). Chairperson-in-Office Moavero
Milanesi also met with the Ukrainian Foreign Minister P.
Klimkin in New York and Milan on 26 September and 6
December. The Italian Chairmanship gathered consensus
in a timely manner on the renewal of the mandates and
adoption of the budgets of the Special Monitoring Mission
to Ukraine and the Observer Mission at the Russian
Checkpoints Gukovo and Donetsk and provided both field
operations with political guidance and resources to fulfil
their respective mandates. The Chairmanship facilitated
an agreement to extend the duration of the mandate of
the Observer Mission at the Russian Checkpoints from
three to four months, contributing to strengthening its
effectiveness. Reacting to ongoing developments on the
ground, the Chairmanship also convened two special
Permanent Council meetings to address the implications
of security developments in and around Ukraine,
particularly the 11 November so-called “elections” held in
certain areas of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions running
counter to the letter and spirit of the Minsk agreements

and the 25 November incidents at sea involving detention
of Ukrainian vessels and sailors.
Over the course of the year, significant progress was
achieved in the Transdniestrian settlement process, and
a round of negotiations took place in the 5+2 format in
Rome in May, which ended with the signing of the Rome
Protocol. This important agreement outlines clear timelines
and mechanisms to ensure the rapid finalization of the
outstanding issues from the “package of eight” priorities
identified by the Sides in 2017. Among other things, the
Italian Chairmanship made a significant contribution to the
establishment of the Joint Vehicle Registration offices in
Tiraspol and Bender, as one important initiative to positively
affect the lives of civilians. The Chairmanship continued
to support the Geneva International Discussions (GID)
dealing with the consequences of the August 2008 war
in Georgia. This included co-chairing the GID and cofacilitating the Incident Prevention and Resonse Mechanism
in Ergneti, which resumed meetings in December 2018

after a temporary suspension. An expert meeting on
environmental threats was organized in Rome, and a water
infrastructure project was launched to support people living
close to the administrative boundary lines. Furthermore,
the efforts of the OSCE Minsk Group Co-Chairs towards
a peaceful resolution of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict,
as well as the engagement of the Personal Representative
of the Chairperson-in-Office on the Conflict dealt with by
the Minsk Conference and the High-Level Planning Group,
were supported by the Chairmanship. On the occasion of
Italian President Sergio Mattarella’s first visit to the region,
the Italian Foreign Minister and OSCE Chairperson-inOffice Moavero Milanesi held fruitful meetings with his
Armenian and Azerbaijani counterparts, during which he
highlighted the opportunity to make progress in relaunching
dialogue to favour a peaceful and consensual solution to
the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. With the region high on
the OSCE agenda, the Permanent Representatives of the
OSCE participating States visited the South Caucasus to
get acquainted with the situation on the ground and to
focus on OSCE relations with national authorities. This was
also reflected by new OSCE project initiatives in Armenia,
Azerbaijan and Georgia facilitated by the Chairmanship.
The Chairmanship advocated full adherence to OSCE
principles and commitments in politico-military affairs by
all participating States as a way to restore the European
security architecture and rules-based order. The
Chairmanship also promoted meaningful dialogue and
exchanges within existing formats. Special attention was
devoted to the process known as “Structured Dialogue
on current and future challenges to European security”,
in strict adherence with the Hamburg mandate, with the
aim of working to create an environment conducive to
reinvigorating conventional arms control and confidenceand security building measures (CSBMs) in Europe. The
Structured Dialogue promoted, among other things,
opportunities for military-to-military contacts and factual
exchanges and analyses of military postures, military
incidents and mechanisms for risk reduction.
Various forms of transnational threats and particularly
illicit trafficking of small arms and light weapons, cultural
heritage, illicit drugs and hazardous waste are among the
most pervasive threats to security and stability in the OSCE
region. Fighting terrorism and tackling the threat of returning
and relocating foreign terrorist fighters received particular
attention, especially at the 2018 OSCE-wide counterterrorism conference held in Rome on 10–11 May and at
the 2018 Ministerial Council in Milan. The Chairmanship
devoted significant attention to combating illicit trafficking in
cultural property and to breaking its links with the financing
of terrorism and organized crime, also by organizing an

awareness-raising exhibition called “Tesori Recuperati”
(“Recovered Treasures”). The Chairmanship also focused
on the risk of conflicts stemming from the use of information
and communication technology (ICT) and involved
academia and the private sector in broad multi-stakeholder
discussions on cyber/ICT security, issues that were also
addressed at the 2018 OSCE-wide Conference on cyber/
ICT security held in Rome on 27–28 September.
ENHANCING DIALOGUE AND TRUST
The Chairmanship broadened the scope of work in the
economic and environmental dimension, introducing new
OSCE commitments related to issues where the concern
of all participating States is converging, such as those
stemming from increasingly digital economies. To this end,
the Chairmanship devoted a broad range of events to these
topics, including the three meetings of the Economic and
Environmental Forum, as well as three ad hoc meetings,
bringing together public officials, academia and the private
sector, also as a way to harness co-operation in this area
to strengthen the implementation of the OSCE concept of
comprehensive security.
FOCUSING ON THE MEDITERRANEAN
Building on the success of the Palermo Conference,
organized by Italy in 2017 as Chair of the Mediterranean
Contact Group, the Chairmanship focused in 2018 on
strengthening co-operation with OSCE Mediterranean
Partners for Co-operation. The OSCE Chairperson-inOffice, Foreign Minister Moavero Milanesi, addressed the
OSCE Permanent Council in August, calling for stronger
OSCE engagement and co-operation in the Mediterranean,
reiterating the inextricable link between security in the
OSCE area and in the Euro-Mediterranean region enshrined
in the Helsinki Final Act. This call translated into the
adoption by the Milan Ministerial Council of a declaration
on security and co-operation in the Mediterranean, which
calls on the OSCE to adopt a more strategic approach in
dealing with Mediterranean-related issues, including by
mainstreaming a Mediterranean perspective throughout
the work of the Organization. In line with this ambition, the
Chairmanship partnered with the Carabinieri Corps of the
Centre of Excellence for Stability Police Units and the Office

of the OSCE Special Representative and Co-ordinator for
Combating Trafficking in Human Beings to launch a new
round of the flagship OSCE simulation-based training on
combating human trafficking along migration routes, which
further involved representatives from OSCE Mediterranean
Partners. The Chairmanship also financed the Green
Entrepreneurs in the Mediterranean project, which will
continue in 2019, as a way to strengthen the link between
the OSCE and young entrepreneurs from the Mediterranean
whose innovative business ideas are contributing to
improving the environment and making a social impact in
their communities. In addition, the Chairmanship financed
ODIHR’s Young Policy Advisers Course directed at 30
young policy professionals from Mediterranean Partners
working as political or policy advisers in ministries,
presidential administrations, parliaments or other state
institutions.
IMPLEMENTING OUR COMMON
COMMITMENTS
Participating States have developed a comprehensive,
consensual and valuable set of commitments. The
Chairmanship focused on their implementation and on
the exchange of best practices, as well as continuous
dialogue with all relevant stakeholders as keys to
strengthening security in the whole OSCE area. In this
regard, the Chairmanship leveraged OSCE institutions
and executive structures to promote informed discussion
on the implementation of OSCE commitments in all three
dimensions. The Annual Security Review Conference,
as well as the Economic and Environmental Dimension
Implementation Meeting, together with the Human
Dimension Implementation Meeting (HDIM), provided
the basis for in-depth assessments of the current state
of play. In addition, the Chairmanship convened a broad
range of meetings, including three Supplementary Human
Dimension Meetings on, respectively, the topics of child
trafficking, violence against women, and human rights and
education; two meetings on, respectively, the role of women
in the security sector and on their participation in the digital
economy; and, in co-operation with the High Commissioner
on National Minorities, one meeting to celebrate the 10th
anniversary of the Bolzano/Bozen Recommendations
on National Minorities in Inter-State Relations. The Italian
Chairmanship also worked to strengthen the role and
positioning of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly (PA)
vis-à-vis the Vienna-based governmental segment of
the Organization. Mindful of the important role played
by parliamentarian diplomacy as a trust-building tool to
foster rapprochement and synergies among participating
States, the Italian Chairmanship invested in promoting
the initiatives, activities and outputs of the PA, including
its election monitoring conducted jointly with ODIHR. The
Italian Chairmanship devoted a great deal of attention
to strengthening the OSCE’s role in combating racism,

“Euro-Mediterranean security is indivisible from, and
complementary to, Euro-Atlantic and Eurasian security. This
is the vision that inspired the founders of our Organization,
the signatories of the Helsinki Final Act. This is the vision
that we brought forward during our Chairmanship.”

xenophobia, intolerance and discrimination, including
on religious grounds. In this regard, the Chairmanship
convened in Rome an international conference on the
responsibility of states, institutions and individuals in the
fight against anti-Semitism in the OSCE area, as well as a
conference on combating intolerance and discrimination,
with a focus on discrimination based on religion or belief.
Under the auspices of the Italian Chairmanship, a workshop
on the protection of human rights defenders was organized
in Rome, focused on the implementation of the relevant
OSCE guidelines.

25TH MINISTERIAL COUNCIL
6–7 DECEMBER 2018, MILAN, ITALY
The Ministerial Council, consisting of the ministers
for foreign affairs of the participating States, is the
OSCE’s central governing body and an important
forum for political consultations. It is traditionally
held in the country holding the OSCE Chairmanship.
The Chairmanship’s efforts to reinvigorate the commitment
of participating States to work together to ensure security
in the OSCE region culminated at the Milan Ministerial
Council, which took place against the backdrop of growing
international tensions following the incidents at sea near
the Kerch Strait. The Ministerial Council capitalized on
discussions initiated in October in Rome among the political
directors of the 57 participating States. Over the course of
two days, discussions among the foreign ministers were
held in a variety of formats, both formal and informal, and at
varying levels. Most notably, during the Ministerial Council,
the OSCE Minsk Group Co-Chair countries (France, the
Russian Federation and the United States of America) and
the Foreign Minister of Azerbaijan, Elmar Mammadyarov,
and the Acting Foreign Minister of Armenia, Zohrab
Mnatsakanyan, issued a joint statement in which the sides
agreed to continue working towards a just and lasting
10

peaceful settlement of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict and
to further reduce tensions.
A series of eight side events allowed ministers and officials
to discuss in a more informal setting a wide range of issues,
including violent extremism and radicalization that lead to
terrorism, economic connectivity and freedom of religion or
belief.
In Milan, OSCE participating States adopted 11 decisions
and declarations in, for the first time since 2014, all three
dimensions of security. They agreed to continue their efforts
in the field of norms and best practices on small arms and
light weapons and stockpiles of conventional ammunition.
By adopting a declaration on youth and security, the
Ministerial Council recognized the role young people
can play in contributing to a culture of peace, dialogue,
justice and peaceful coexistence, trust and reconciliation.
Decisions were also adopted to strengthen efforts to
prevent and combat child trafficking and to prevent and
combat violence against women. The Ministerial Council
also approved a decision on human capital development
in the digital era and a declaration on the digital economy,
adding new and increasingly important topics to the
portfolio of the economic and environmental dimension.
Adopting a decision on the safety of journalists, the
Ministerial Council strengthened, for the first time since
2014, the human dimension acquis, introducing the first
commitments to protect the safety of journalists since
1994. Adopting a declaration on security and co-operation
in the Mediterranean, the participating States encouraged
the OSCE to mainstream a Mediterranean perspective
throughout the work of the Organization.
Referring to the positive developments in the
Transdniestrian settlement process, the participating States
adopted a statement welcoming the confidence building
measures (CBMs) agreed by the Sides and called on them
to seek further tangible progress. Finally, the 2018 OSCE
Chairmanship Troika (Austria, Italy, Slovakia), together with
Albania as the incoming Troika member, issued two socalled Quadriga declarations highlighting their concern
about deepened mistrust, increased tensions and conflict
and instability within and between OSCE participating
States and reflecting their concern regarding the crisis in
and around Ukraine.

TRILATERAL CONTACT GROUP
AMBASSADOR MARTIN SAJDIK
Special Representative of the Chairpersonin-Office in Ukraine and in the Trilateral
Contact Group
The Trilateral Contact Group (TCG) includes
representatives from the OSCE, Ukraine and
Russia, as well as agreed participants from certain
areas of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. The
TCG is the only forum where the conflict sides
meet on a regular basis to discuss issues of
essential importance for the civilian population.
The TCG agenda covers a wide range of topics in
the political, security, economic and humanitarian
spheres, ranging from measures to strengthen the
ceasefire, exchange of detainees, environmental
issues or ways to make it easier and safer for
the population to cross the contact line, to
discussions on the implementation of the political
aspects of the Minsk agreements.
In 2018, the main focus of the work was the
protection of civilians. Regular re-commitments to
the ceasefire (“Easter ceasefire” in March, “harvest
ceasefire” in June and “back-to-school ceasefire”
in August), brokered at the TCG, helped contain
the fighting along the contact line and significantly
decreased the number of civilian casualties. The

latter fell roughly by half in 2018 compared with
2017. As a result, 2018 was the year with the
lowest number of civilian dead and wounded
since the conflict began in 2014.
With regard to improving the overall living
conditions for the population in the conflict area,
the TCG, in close co-operation with the OSCE
Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine, devoted
consistent attention to enabling the continued
supply of water, electricity and gas, among
other things, by facilitating windows of silence
for repair works on civilian infrastructure or for
allowing workers to access critically important
civilian facilities on the contact line. Moreover,
solutions were found to re-establish and improve
the functioning of the mobile network across the
contact line. This is of essential humanitarian
importance, as it allows people living in the
non-government-controlled areas to receive
information on their pension payments and to
reach their relatives and friends on the other side
of the contact line.

THE HIGH-LEVEL PLANNING GROUP
https://www.osce.org/chairmanship/high-level-planning-group

(OSCE/Jonathan Perfect)

AMBASSADOR ANDRZEJ KASPRZYK
Personal Representative of the OSCE Chairperson-inOffice on the Conflict Dealt with by the OSCE Minsk
Conference
www.osce.org/prcio

In accordance with the decision of the 1994 Budapest
Summit on Intensification of CSCE action in relation to the
Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, the High-Level Planning Group
(HLPG) was established. The HLPG is mandated to make
recommendations to the Chairperson-in-Office regarding
a possible multinational OSCE peacekeeping force. In
accordance with this mandate, the HLPG consistently engaged
throughout 2018 with a range of organizations and actors in
order to review and enhance its planning options for a possible
peacekeeping mission. It continued to closely liaise with
OSCE executive structures and provided focused briefings
to OSCE delegations. Drawing on the experiences and
valuable lessons gained by other relevant organizations and
institutions to improve its planning process, the HLPG visited
the Multinational Civil-Military Co-operation Group in Motta di
Livenza and the UN Global Services Centre in Brindisi, both
located in Italy. It also successfully re-established co-operation
with the South-Eastern Europe Brigade in Tyrnavos, Greece.

Throughout 2018, the Personal Representative,
Ambassador Andrzej Kasprzyk, and his team conducted
monitoring exercises, provided a continuous review of the
situation on the ground, supported the Chairperson-inOffice and the Minsk Group Co-Chairs, and continued
to look for opportunities to promote further confidence
building measures with the consent of the sides. The Office
is the only OSCE field presence in the South Caucasus
and the only international presence with access to the front
lines.
The situation on the front lines has been relatively stable
since the beginning of 2018, and the sides have reported
fewer ceasefire violations and casualties, as well as hardly
any use of more lethal weapons such as mortars and
grenade launchers in ceasefire violations.
The Office conducted monitoring exercises 17 times on
the Line of Contact and seven times on the ArmenianAzerbaijani border. The monitoring activities and logistical
support also enabled representatives of the HighLevel Planning Group to visit the region in May, July and

in February, June and October. At the request of the sides,
the Office was also involved in a humanitarian operation
in August, supporting a search and retrieval operation to
recover the remains of a civilian from a minefield located
between front-line positions.
The Office provided reports and briefings for the
Chairmanship and the Co-Chairs on an ongoing basis,
covering all aspects of the situation on the ground, the
Office’s activities, as well as key events that have an
impact on the negotiations. A group of OSCE Permanent
Representatives who travelled to the South Caucasus in
July visited the office of the Personal Representative in
Tbilisi where they received a briefing.
Ambassador Kasprzyk also assisted the Co-Chairs in
organizing meetings at the level of foreign ministers in May,
July, September and December and personally hosted a
two-day meeting of the foreign ministers in Krakow, Poland,
in January.

The situation related to the aftermath of the August 2008
war in Georgia remained relatively calm and stable against
the background of increased military activity, as well as
humanitarian challenges on the ground.
Ambassador Rudolf Michalka assumed the position of
Special Representative of the OSCE Chairperson-inOffice for the South Caucasus in September 2018, taking
over from Ambassador Günther Bächler. Together with his
fellow Co-Chairs from the European Union and the United
Nations, Ambassador Michalka co-chaired two rounds of
the Geneva International Discussions (GID); his predecessor,
Ambassador Bächler, co-chaired the previous two rounds in
the first half of 2018.
Discussions concerning a joint declaration on the non-use
of force continued. The GID and its associated Incident
Prevention and Response Mechanisms (IPRM) remain the
only platforms for defusing tensions and address concrete
issues. Participants consider the IPRM meetings – held in
Ergneti and Gali – an important tool for dialogue to resolve
specific issues for the local population on the ground.
They took place regularly during the year until a temporary
suspension in the second half of 2018, although the Ergneti
IPRM resumed in December.
The Chairmanship also supported further confidencebuilding measures in the field of environmental threats and
concerning youth in the region.

(OSCE/Igor Schimbător)

The Italian OSCE Chairmanship together with the OSCE
Mission to Moldova facilitated the further implementation of
the “package of eight”, thus ensuring continued progress in
the results-oriented process. During his visits to the Republic
of Moldova, Special Representative Frattini underscored that
the Sides need to exercise leadership (bottom-up approach)
and encouraged the chief negotiators in Chisinau and
Tiraspol to make the best use of the working groups and
1+1 meetings. In 2018, 69 meetings were organized for the
working groups and 26 more for the chief negotiators.
On 29-30 May, a conference in the 5+2 format took place
in Rome. The corresponding Rome Protocol outlines clear
timelines and mechanisms to ensure the rapid finalization
of the outstanding issues from the priorities identified by the
Sides. One particular success has been the implementation
of the agreement on permission to operate Transdniestrian
vehicles on international roads, following the establishment
of two Joint Vehicle Registration offices in Bender and
Tiraspol, with the assistance of the Mission to Moldova and
financial support of the Italian OSCE Chairmanship. During
the Ministerial Council in Milan on 6-7 December, a Ministerial
Statement on the negotiations on the Transdniestrian
Settlement Process in the 5+2 format was adopted and
once again highlighted the achievements reached and the
continuing progress in this context.

Chairmanship-inOffice on Combating

of the OSCE
Chairperson-in-Office
on Gender

The Italian OSCE Chairmanship included the fight against
corruption among its top priorities and decided to
appoint Professor Paola Severino as the first-ever OSCE
Special Representative in this area. Throughout the year,
Special Representative Severino significantly enhanced
the visibility of the OSCE among international agencies
involved in the fight against corruption by actively promoting
OSCE principles and commitments and by encouraging
governments and international organizations to combine
and intensify their anti-corruption efforts. She visited
several OSCE countries, including Albania, Armenia,
Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Russian Federation, Serbia
and Ukraine, where she met with both senior government
officials and representatives of civil society in order to help
create conditions conducive to inclusive and co-operative
responses to corruption. As a follow-up to these visits, and
upon request by the government of Armenia, the Office of
the Co-ordinator of Economic and Environmental Activities
(OCEEA) developed a project to support national anticorruption efforts. Similarly, the OCEEA designed a project
to promote integrity in several municipal governments
following the request of selected municipalities in Ukraine.
On 12-13 November, Professor Severino organized
and chaired the high-level conference Developing AntiCorruption Strategies for the Digital Age – Recent Trends
and Best Practices in the OSCE Area, a milestone activity
in good governance in 2018. Attended by high-ranking
state dignitaries and senior experts from numerous OSCE
participating States, the conference resulted in a series of
policy recommendations for strengthening anti-corruption
measures. The Chairmanship also supported further
confidence building measures in the field of environmental
threats and concerning youth in the region.

Ambassador Melanne Verveer joined the Chairperson of
the Permanent Council, Ambassador Azzoni, and Secretary
General Greminger on International Women’s Day to
address the Permanent Council. She focused on the need
for the seamless integration of women’s perspectives and
participation in every aspect of the OSCE’s work in order
to more effectively fulfil the Organization’s mission. At an
OSCE co-sponsored conference on women in peacebuilding focused on unresolved conflicts in the region,
Ambassador Verveer noted that women’s participation
can no longer be viewed as an option, but that it is rather a
necessity for conflict resolution and sustainable peace. The
Special Representative also spoke at the Chairmanship’s
conference Women in the Security Sector organized in cooperation with the OSCE Gender Section and ODIHR. On
that occasion, she noted the correlation between inclusion
and operational effectiveness in policing, armed services,
border patrols, the Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine
and related operations. She also addressed the event Digital
Transformation – Challenges and Opportunities for Women
to Shape Economic Progress in the OSCE Area jointly
organized by the Italian Chairmanship and the OSCE Gender
Section. In particular, she underlined the need to overcome
persistent barriers to women’s participation in the digital
economy.
Ambassador Verveer made a country visit to Uzbekistan,
which, under its new leadership, has embarked on a series
of important reforms, including a commitment to women’s
equality. In addition to meetings with officials and others,
she addressed the regional Conference on the Role of
Women in Democratic Renewal and Modernization of the
Country.Throughout the Italian Chairmanship, she was
also engaged in a number of other activities, including
addressing a working session of the 2018 HDIM devoted
to gender equality, the United Nations on the OSCE survey
on the safety of women in the region, and young women
leaders from Belgrade and Pristina participating in the OSCE
Dialogue Academy.

The Representative continued to assist in the implementation

of Latvia and the Russian Federation on social guarantees
for military pensioners from the Russian Federation and
their families residing in Latvia. Some 7,061 people currently
fall under the special provisions of the agreement. Until
2008, the work of the Representative focused on individual
complaints of military pensioners relating to registration and
housing issues. The Commission was able to settle almost
all of these cases, and no further individual complaints have
been made since 2008. Furthermore, there were no new
fundamental issues concerning the work of the Commission

future, the 2018 report to the Permanent Council concluded
that the function of the Representative should continue to

PARTNERS FOR CO-OPERATION
The OSCE maintains special relations with five Asian and six Mediterranean Partners for Co-operation to better address
shared security challenges. In 2018, the Italian Chairmanship promoted the active involvement of the Partners in OSCE
events and activities. Supported by the outgoing and incoming OSCE Chairmanship, it also ensured continued dialogue
between the OSCE and its Partners in the framework of the Asian and Mediterranean Contact Group.

The 2018 Austrian Chairmanship of the Asian Contact
Group worked closely with the five OSCE Asian Partners
and the Italian OSCE Chairmanship to introduce new and
innovative topics to the OSCE agenda with the Partners.
The rolling schedule of Asian Contact Group meetings
reflected the inclusive security approach that the OSCE
stands for and took into consideration new opportunities
arising in the Asian region as well as common global
challenges in the respective regions of both the OSCE
and the Asian Partners.
As links between Asia and the OSCE are becoming
stronger, Austria put a particular emphasis on ensuring
extensive and thematically focused dialogue with
the Asian Partners. The Contact Group continued
to be a vital forum for sharing views and exchanging
experiences, enabling OSCE participating States and the
Asian Partners to jointly look for co-operative solutions to
global and regional security challenges.
The Contact Group met five times in 2018 and discussed
the following topics:
 Cyber/ICT security and cyber-diplomacy;
 Economic connectivity with a particular focus on
financial technology innovations: challenges to cyber/
ICT security, as well as opportunities for securing the
Sustainable Development Goals (SDG);
 Regional co-operation and women’s economic
empowerment;
 Trade facilitation; and
 The security situation on the Korean Peninsula.

A number of high-profile representatives from Partner
countries and OSCE participating States, representatives
of international organizations, the private sector, civil
society, as well as distinguished academics and experts
from the OSCE Secretariat provided insightful and
engaging presentations, which enriched the discussions
at Asian Contact Group meetings.
As Chairmanship of the Contact Group, Austria also
continued the established practice of actively promoting
practical co-operation and contributed to the OSCE
Partnership Fund, which enabled adequate participation
of Asian Partners in OSCE activities and events.

2018 OSCE ASIAN CONFERENCE
The 2018 OSCE Asian Conference was held in
Canberra on 5 November and covered all three security
dimensions, focusing on the impact of multilateral
architecture on global security; on economic connectivity
and sustainability, including liberalizing global trade;
and on the promotion of human rights, including issues
related to women and the safety of journalists. The topics
discussed during the Conference working sessions
complemented the 2018 thematic priorities of the Asian
Contact Group and helped ensure continuity in the
OSCE’s interaction with its Asian Partners on common
challenges and common opportunities in today’s
interconnected world.

The 2018 Slovak Chairmanship of the Mediterranean
Contact Group (MCG) built on the successful work
of previous Chairmanships and advanced a positive,
constructive and forward-looking agenda. Topics that
highlighted common opportunities and shared concerns
were jointly chosen with the Mediterranean Partners for
Co-operation. Overall, five MCG meetings and the OSCE
Mediterranean Conference in Málaga were held in 2018.
The meetings were devoted to topics such as:
 energy security, the protection of critical energy
infrastructure, the development and integration of
renewable energy and the best use of digitalization for
energy security;
 perspectives on water management from both sides
of the Mediterranean with a focus on the connections
between economic, social and environmental challenges;
 cyber/ICT security and possibilities for co-operation
between the OSCE and Mediterranean Partners in
implementing existing confidence building measures in
the area of information technology security;
 education as a means to combat radicalization and to
make it a real tool for the prevention of violent extremism;
 security sector governance and reform focused on
lessons learned from the Mediterranean Partners and
their relevance for OSCE participating States.

opportunities in this context. Participants engaged in an open
debate on the role of energy in promoting Euro-Mediterranean
security and exchanged views on how to take existing cooperation to the next level for the sake of enhancing security
in the Mediterranean, and in line with OSCE principles and
commitments. Participants recognized the crucial role of
energy not only in terms of economic growth, but in many
other aspects as well, from peoples’ daily lives to reshaping
geopolitics. The importance of connectivity, sustainability and
responsibility were highlighted in the discussions, as was the
need for a new energy narrative - a new strategic approach
among the participating States and Partners. Discussions
also touched on opportunities deriving from the expansion
of renewable energy sources in OSCE and Mediterranean
Partner countries. The role of renewable energy sources in
environmental protection and the reduction of greenhouse gas
emissions were also discussed.
The Conference allowed for an exchange of views on how the
OSCE participating States and the Mediterranean Partners for
Co-operation can make their partnership even more relevant,
substantial and action-oriented in the years to come.

The five MCG meetings held in 2018 provided a platform for
informing OSCE participating States about developments,
co-operation and challenges in the Mediterranean region.

2018 OSCE MEDITERRANEAN
CONFERENCE

During the 2018 Italian OSCE Chairmanship, the weekly
meetings of the Permanent Council were chaired
by Italy’s Permanent Representative to the OSCE,
Ambassador Alessandro Azzoni.
Throughout the year, Ambassador Azzoni welcomed
distinguished guest speakers to the Permanent Council,
including ministers and deputy ministers from the
participating States and high-level representatives from
international organizations. Guest speakers highlighted
issues of special relevance to the Chairmanship, such
as the humanitarian situation in the conflict zone in
eastern Ukraine, migration-related issues, trafficking in
human beings, cyber/ICT security and security in the
Mediterranean.
Besides the work of the OSCE institutions and field
operations, in view of unresolved conflict and crisis
situations in the OSCE area, various conflict settlement
efforts played an important part in many of the 34
sessions of the Permanent Council in 2018. On the crisis
in and around Ukraine alone, the Special Representative
of the Chairperson-in-Office in Ukraine and in the
Trilateral Contact Group, Ambassador Martin Sajdik,
and the Chief Monitor of the Special Monitoring Mission
to Ukraine, Ambassador Ertuğrul Apakan, briefed the
Permanent Council five times. The Chairmanship also
organized ad hoc briefings with the four chairpersons of
the working groups under the Trilateral Contact Group.
The meetings of the Permanent Council provided an
opportunity to foster close, mutually beneficial cooperation with other international organizations active
in the OSCE area through the participation of highlevel representatives of the Council of Europe (CoE),
the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the
International Organization for Migration (IOM), and the
United Nations Office of Counter-Terrorism (UNOCT),
as well as representatives from the private sector
(Microsoft).

FORUM FOR
SECURITY
CO-OPERATION
The Forum for Security Co-operation (FSC) is the OSCE’s
key decision-making body on politico-military aspects of
security. Its participants meet weekly in Vienna to discuss
issues such as arms control, and confidence- and security
building measures. The Forum Chairmanship rotates among
the OSCE participating States, with each state chairing
the FSC for four months. In 2018, the FSC was chaired by
Slovakia, Slovenia and Sweden.

www.osce.org/forum-for-security-cooperation

Discussions on the crisis in and around Ukraine continued to be the dominant topic at the
weekly sessions of the Forum for Security Co-operation. Throughout the year, the Forum
addressed key issues and developments related to confidence- and security building
measures, military transparency, security sector governance and reform (SSG/R), the Code
of Conduct on Politico-Military Aspects of Security, small arms and light weapons (SALW)
and stockpiles of conventional ammunition (SCA), military doctrine, UN Security Council
Resolutions (UNSCRs) 1540 (2004) and 1325 (2000) and subregional military and defence
co-operation. The Forum adopted eight decisions designed to support the implementation
of existing commitments, including the adoption of the decision on the Best Practice Guide
on Deactivation of SALW. Its work also led to the adoption of the declaration on OSCE
Efforts in the Field of Norms and Best Practices on SALW and SCA by the 25th Ministerial
Council.

A PLATFORM FOR DIALOGUE
The FSC continued to provide valuable opportunities
for dialogue and discussion on the most pressing
security issues in the OSCE region, including political
and military commitments. The three successive 2018
FSC Chairmanships – Slovakia, Slovenia and Sweden –
invested considerable effort in strengthening the OSCE’s
focus on the politico-military dimension of security by
maximizing the use of the FSC as a forum for negotiations
and consultations on military security and stability in the
OSCE area. A total of 24 so-called Security Dialogues were
devoted to matters related to topical European security
issues, including CSBMs, the Code of Conduct, SALW
and SCA, military doctrine, UNSCRs 1540 (2004) and 1325
(2000) and subregional military and defence co-operation,
geographically spanning the Višegrad Group, South-Eastern
Europe, as well as the Nordic and Baltic Sea region.

Topics that were discussed included military transparency,
the role of mine action throughout the conflict cycle and the
rights and obligations of military personnel. Two FSC special
sessions were held: one commemorating the centenary of
the end of World War I and another commemorating the
18th anniversary of UNSCR 1325 on Women, Peace and
Security, which was followed by the release of an OSCE
handbook on gender in military operations and a panel
discussion on the role of military commanders in preventing
sexual and gender-based violence. Throughout the year,
significant efforts were made to elevate the women, peace
and security agenda in the FSC.
All three FSC Chairmanships co-operated closely with the
Italian OSCE Chairmanship and the Permanent Council on
cross-dimensional issues of relevance to both bodies in line
with the OSCE’s concept of comprehensive and indivisible

security. To this end, four joint meetings were held: one on
SSG/R, two on the Structured Dialogue and one on the
Mediterranean and the security of the OSCE’s southern
region.
The 28th Annual Implementation Assessment Meeting
in February provided an opportunity to discuss the
current and future implementation of agreed CSBMs. In
accordance with its mandate, the FSC contributed to the
Annual Security Review Conference held in June. The
Seventh Annual Discussion on the implementation of
the Code of Conduct was also held in June. Two further
conferences on the Code of Conduct, in Bucharest and
Berlin, provided unique opportunities to discuss the
implementation and promote awareness of the Code. The
heads of verification centres met in December to exchange
views on technical aspects of the Vienna Document 2011.
Significant work was accomplished on SALW and SCA,
including the adoption of a decision on the Best Practice
Guide on Deactivation of SALW in February. Furthermore,
four security dialogues on SALW and SCA were organized,
including one to launch preparations for the OSCE’s
contribution to the UN’s Third Review Conference on the
Programme of Action (RevCon3). In October, the Biennial
Meeting to Assess the Implementation of the OSCE
Documents on SALW and SCA was held in Vienna, which
comprised discussions on the implications of RevCon3
outcomes on the OSCE’s work, the OSCE Plan of Action on
SALW, OSCE handbooks on best practices and the OSCE
assistance mechanism. The efficient work on this topic
stimulated the participating States to adopt the Declaration
on OSCE Efforts in the Field of Norms and Best Practices
on SALW and SCA at the Ministerial Council in Milan in
December.

GUEST CONTRIBUTORS TO THE SECURITY
DIALOGUES IN 2018: A FEW HIGHLIGHTS
In the course of 2018, a number of representatives
from international organizations and institutions took
part in the Forum’s discussions. For example, the
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), INTERPOL,
the Stockholm International Peace Research
Institute (SIPRI), the Preparatory Commission for the
Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization
(CTBTO) and the World Customs Organization (WCO)
contributed to security dialogues on non-proliferation
and UNSCR 1540. Other organizations, such as the UN
Office for Disarmament Affairs (UNODA), the European
External Action Service (EEAS), the South Eastern and
Eastern Europe Clearinghouse for the Control of Small
Arms and Light Weapons (SEESAC) and the Small Arms
Survey contributed to discussions on SALW, which were
held in the format of both security dialogues and the
Biennial Meeting to Assess the Implementation of the
OSCE Documents on SALW and SCA. NATO shared its
work on women, peace and security during a security
dialogue on 9 May 2018, and later presented how NATO
military personnel are trained in the Alliance’s Code
of Conduct at the NATO Defence College in Rome.

Slovakia, Austria, the Holy See, San Marino, Uzbekistan,
Kazakhstan and Switzerland.
In two visits to Ukraine, President Tsereteli reiterated
support for Ukraine’s territorial integrity and renewed calls
to reach a sustained ceasefire. Leading an OSCE PA
delegation to areas on the contact line in eastern Ukraine in
May, Tsereteli stressed that urgent steps must be taken to
alleviate the humanitarian situation of people impacted by
the conflict.
In a visit to Moldova, Tsereteli lauded achievements in
the Transdniestrian settlement process and encouraged
Chisinau and Tiraspol to sustain the momentum to create
conditions for a comprehensive resolution of the conflict.
The Assembly increased its engagement on regional

The OSCE’s Conflict Prevention Centre (CPC) is the main point of contact on
all matters concerning OSCE field operations. It addresses all phases of the
conflict cycle through policy and operational guidance and advice, including
through early warning and support of the OSCE’s response in crisis situations,
and through efforts to find lasting political settlements for existing conflicts.
The CPC is also a core structure of the OSCE’s work in the politico-military
dimension and provides organization-wide support for project management.

THE ARMENIA CO-OPERATION
PROGRAMME (ACP)
At the request of the Armenian authorities, the CPC set
up a programme to sustain co-ordinated programmatic
activities in the absence of a field operation in the
country. The ACP involves project-based collaboration
with the Republic of Armenia across the OSCE agenda.

In response to Armenia’s expressed wishes, the
ACP involves a number of initiatives that build on
the work of the former OSCE Office in Yerevan.

The initial objectives of the ACP are to:
 Ensure continuity of reforms in the security sector;
 Maintain continuity and sustainability of the
development of community policing;
 Enhance the capacities of the
Aarhus Centres network;
 Improve the economic security of women; and
 Reduce the risk of wildfires through enhanced
management and improved capacities for reducing
the risk of wildfire disasters.
Five projects have been developed under the ACP
to date, including one short-term project funding a
needs assessment for security sector governance and
reform and one for community policing. The remaining
three projects provide 18 to 24 months of support to
continue flagship environmental activities on wildfire
management and the green economy, and also
enable expansion of the work of Women’s Resource
Centres in the promotion of entrepreneurship. The
overall budget of the ACP for 2018 was €550,000.

CONTINUED FOCUS ON THE CRISIS IN AND
AROUND UKRAINE
The CPC continued to play a key role in co-ordinating the
OSCE’s response to the crisis in and around Ukraine. It
promoted efforts to support stabilization on the ground and
the implementation of the Minsk agreements. It also worked
with the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine
(SMM) to support implementation of its mandate throughout
Ukraine; reinforce the Mission’s capacities for facilitation
efforts in the conflict area; further consolidate the Mission’s
reporting, internal procedures and policies; as well as
strengthen its technical surveillance capabilities. The CPC
provided close support for the work of the Trilateral Contact
Group (TCG) in its conflict resolution and mediation efforts.
It also assisted the work of the OSCE Project Co-ordinator
in Ukraine and the Observer Mission at the Russian
Checkpoints Gukovo and Donetsk.
ACTIVITIES IN SUPPORT OF CONFLICT
RESOLUTION
The CPC supported the Transdniestrian settlement process
in Moldova, working closely with the OSCE Mission to
Moldova and the Special Representative of the OSCE
Chairperson-in-Office for the Transdniestrian Settlement
Process. It actively supported efforts by the Chairmanship
and the Mission to Moldova to reach an agreement on
outstanding points of the "package of eight", a list of
measures agreed upon by the Sides at the start of 2017.
The CPC supported a 5+2 meeting in Rome on 30 May
2018, which resulted in the Rome Protocol, with agreements
aimed at improving the lives of residents on both sides of
the Dniester/Nistru River to be implemented by the end
of 2018. These included the opening of the Gura Bicului
Bychok Bridge, initiating the apostilization of Transdniestrian
university diplomas, ensuring the functioning of Latin-script
schools on the left bank, restoring access to Dubasari
farmlands and launching a mechanism for the participation
of Transdniestrian vehicles in international road traffic.
The CPC supported the work of the Special Representative
of the OSCE Chairperson-in-Office for the South Caucasus
during four rounds of the Geneva International Discussions

the August 2008 war in Georgia, and at five meetings of the
Incident Prevention and Response Mechanism in Ergneti
(before and after their temporary suspension). The CPC
arranged briefings for the new Special Representative after
he took up his role in September 2018. It also participated
in numerous consultations in Tbilisi, Sukhumi, Tskhinvali
and Moscow, and co-moderated the GID working group
dealing with humanitarian issues. In support of the GID, the
CPC organized a summer school in Vienna to familiarize
youth from the region and beyond with OSCE values
and commitments, and to build ties among populations
divided by the conflict. Other CPC projects focused on
humanitarian issues such as missing persons from the
2008 war.
The CPC also supported the OSCE Minsk Group CoChairs and the Personal Representative of the Chairpersonin-Office on the Conflict Dealt with by the OSCE Minsk
Conference.
ACTIVITIES IN CENTRAL ASIA
In addition to regular activities, the CPC facilitated an open
alumni meeting of the OSCE Academy in Vienna in June,
the first of its kind outside the region since the Academy’s
inception in 2003. The meeting, which was co-organized
by the Italian OSCE Chairmanship and the OSCE Academy,
offered an opportunity for all participating States to meet
and interact with selected Academy alumni.
The CPC also worked with the OSCE Transnational Threats
Department to secure funding and support planning for the
medium-term outlook of the OSCE Border Management
Staff College (BMSC) in Dushanbe.
In June, the CPC, together with the Programme Office in
Astana, organized a side event to promote the work of the
field operation to potential donor participating States and to
seek extrabudgetary funds for two major projects on police
and judicial reform in Kazakhstan. Representatives from
the host country’s Ministry of Internal Affairs, the Supreme
Court and civil society presented project concepts for

SECRETARIAT    Conflict prevention

the modernization of the police, including human capital,
technologies and services, as well as for the reform of the
judicial system, with a focus on the independence of the
judiciary.
ACTIVITIES IN SOUTH-EASTERN EUROPE
In addition to regular activities, the CPC co-ordinated field
operations’ actions and responses to key developments
with a view to facilitating dialogue and contributing to the
reduction of tensions. The CPC continued to provide policy
and strategic support to the Mission to Skopje on realigning
its respective programmes in response to developments on
the ground and needs of the host country. Together with
the Mission to Bosnia and Herzegovina, the CPC supported
efforts to promote a political compromise on the electoral
law following the Constitutional Court’s 2016 ruling in the
Ljubic case. In particular, the CPC assisted the OSCE
Secretary General during his visit to the country in February
to highlight the urgency of addressing the legal gap and
ending the political and legislative stalemate in the country.

CONVENTIONAL WEAPONS, EXPLOSIVES,
AMMUNITION, DEMINING AND CHEMICAL
SAFETY AND SECURITY IN UKRAINE
The CPC, jointly with the Transnational Threats
Department, produced a needs assessment for
combating illicit trafficking of weapons, ammunition
and explosives in and across Ukraine's borders.
Consequently, a project aimed at enhancing border
security and management capacities in this field was
initiated. Furthermore, improving emergency response
capacities for clearing explosive remnants of war was
also supported.
Together with the OSCE Project Co-ordinator in Ukraine,
the CPC manages chemical safety and security projects
in Ukraine under the auspices of UNSCR 1540 (2004).
The projects aim to strengthen oversight of controlled
and toxic chemicals and improve Ukraine’s regulatory
system in chemical safety and security.

DURABLE HOUSING SOLUTIONS
In South-Eastern Europe, the CPC, together with three
OSCE field operations (to Bosnia and Herzegovina,
Montenegro and Serbia) continued to work closely
with the UNHCR in support of the implementation
of the Regional Housing Programme (RHP), a multiyear programme aimed at providing durable housing
solutions for some 27,000 of the most vulnerable
refugee families (74,000 people) in Bosnia and
Herzegovina, Croatia, Montenegro and Serbia. The
OSCE’s strategic partnership with the UNHCR, in
support of the RHP, helped enable a process that
successfully addresses the legacy of the conflicts of the
1990s at the regional level. Following the commitment
taken by these four participating States to close the
displacement chapter in the region, the RHP has seen
increasingly positive results and has helped foster
regional co-operation and reconciliation. Some 4,000
housing units have been completed, with that number
soon to reach almost 6,000.

EARLY WARNING
The CPC continued to promote a structured and systematic
approach to early warning across the Organization,
specifically through the Network of Early Warning Focal
Points in OSCE field operations and other executive
structures. It organized the Network’s seventh annual
meeting, gathering 30 representatives for information
sharing and capacity building. Recognizing the essential
role of conflict analysis in early-warning reporting, the CPC
facilitated conflict analysis workshops as a key capacitybuilding tool, alongside regional meetings and other events
focused on the OSCE’s overall conflict cycle toolbox.
MEDIATION SUPPORT
The CPC’s Mediation Support Team (MST) provided
mediation and dialogue facilitation support, for example,
by observing the negotiations within the Transdniestrian
settlement process, the GID and the TCG, and providing
methodological feedback to the mediators. Through
debriefings, coaching and handover retreats, the MST
supported continuity between the Chairperson-in-Office’s
special representatives and made that expertise available
34

throughout their assignments. The MST facilitated strategy
workshops for special representatives and field operations
on mediation process design, including engaging with
insider mediators. Together with the OSCE Gender Section,
the MST initiated OSCE-wide research to develop a toolkit
on the inclusion of women and the effectiveness of peace
processes.
IMPLEMENTING POLITICO-MILITARY
COMMITMENTS
The CPC’s FSC Support Section held several capacitybuilding, awareness-raising and outreach events on issues
related to small arms and light weapons (SALW), stockpiles
of conventional ammunition (SCA), the Code of Conduct
on Politico-Military Aspects of Security and other agreed
CSBMs.
The Section also continued to provide technical and
administrative support for the Informal Working Group on
Structured Dialogue to foster a greater understanding of
current and future challenges to security in the OSCE area.
It continued to process exchanged military information,
prepare CSBM implementation reports and provide
assistance in this regard to the OSCE participating States.
The Section also took several steps to improve the way the
CPC reports on military information.
Assistance for project activities on SALW and SCA
continued in 2018 through ten extrabudgetary projects
managed by the CPC. In Belarus, all 690 tonnes of rocket

fuel components, also known as mélange, were safely
removed from the country and sent for environmentally
sound disposal. Additionally, the technical preparations
for the removal of rocket fuel components in Armenia and
Kyrgyzstan were carried out. In Serbia, the physical security
and safety of conventional ammunition stockpiles were
improved by upgrading the firefighting system. In Georgia,
a total of 461 tonnes of cluster and aviation bombs and
artillery shells were destroyed.
In the OSCE region, efforts to establish a baseline for the
provision of technical advice and institutional support to the
OSCE participating States on the SALW/SCA normative
base and practical assistance projects were supported.
Support for expert assessment visits under the OSCE
Documents on SALW/SCA was also provided.
The CPC also ensured project supervision and advisory
support, including resource mobilization, for the SALW and
SCA projects directly implemented by the field operations in
Bosnia and Herzegovina, the former Yugoslav Republic of
Macedonia, Moldova, Montenegro, Tajikistan and Ukraine.
The Section continued its support to the States Parties to
the Dayton Peace Accords in their implementation of the
Sub-Regional Arms Control Agreement under Article IV,
Annex 1-B, of the General Framework for Peace in Bosnia
and Herzegovina, and assisted participating States in their
implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 1540 on
the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.
SHARING INFORMATION AMONG OSCE
PARTICIPATING STATES
The CPC facilitates the exchange of military information
between and among participating States as stipulated in the
Vienna Document 2011. This sharing of information is key
to building confidence and trust within the OSCE area. The
OSCE Communications Network, established by the 1990
Charter of Paris for a New Europe provides participating
States with a reliable, timely and secure channel for
exchanging information across all dimensions.

SUPPORT TO SECURITY SECTOR
GOVERNANCE/REFORM
The OSCE provides support and expertise to national
security institutions and services on many important
aspects of SSG/R, including police reform, border
management and security and democratic oversight.
In recent years, SSG/R has been recognized by an
increasing number of OSCE participating States
as playing an essential role in conflict prevention,
sustaining peace and furthering development. With
the aim of developing a more coherent and effective
approach to SSG/R, the Secretariat published OSCE
guidelines on SSG/R in April 2016, providing guidance
to OSCE staff supporting nationally led SSG/R
processes, with the objective of increasing the efficiency
and effectiveness of OSCE support. In 2018, the CPC
continued to raise awareness and build capacities
among OSCE staff and the participating States on
SSG/R. A joint OSCE-UNODC regional workshop
in Eastern Europe discussed the value of a wellgoverned security sector in addressing transnational
threats and highlighted the complementary of the
two organizations in this regard. A dedicated Group
of Friends of participating States supported these
efforts. Throughout 2019 and beyond, the OSCE will
continue to strengthen its approach to SSG/R.

all OSCE executive structures develop key performance
indicators. It continued to provide programme and
project management support to the Secretariat and
field operations, and ensured quality control and the
compliance of all extrabudgetary project proposals
with the OSCE Common Regulatory Management
System. Expert advice was provided on 96 project
proposals worth €76.5 million, as well as with respect to
SMM activities funded through voluntary contributions
amounting to €16.1 million. Furthermore, the CPC
facilitated one training session at the Secretariat and
one at a field operation on project cycle management,
programme and project planning, and self-evaluation, in

Throughout 2018, the OSCE’s Transnational Threats Department (TNTD) supported OSCE
participating States and Partners for Co-operation, upon request, in their efforts to counter
transnational threats. The Department provided assistance in translating political commitments
into effective and sustainable activities such as convening joint expert meetings, sharing
information and best practices, and co-ordinating the implementation of projects and plans of
action. TNTD consists of a Co-ordination Cell dealing with cyber/information and communication
technologies security issues and three thematic units: the Action against Terrorism Unit, the
Border Security and Management Unit and the Strategic Police Matters Unit.

CYBER/ICT SECURITY
As states continue to develop their cyber-capabilities,
international peace and security depends on mechanisms
that can help reduce tensions that arise in the wake of major
cyber-incidents. To reduce the risks of conflict stemming
from the use of ICTs, TNTD continued to provide support to
OSCE participating States in 2018 in clarifying procedures
to raise concerns with other states, e.g., via the OSCE
Communications Network.
TNTD continued supporting participating States, upon their
request, in implementing the OSCE’s cyber/ICT security
confidence building measures. Relevant activities included
an ongoing training series on the role of ICTs in the context
of regional and international security and a scenario-based
discussion during the Chairmanship event held in Rome.
Both activities served to promote co-operation on ICTrelated challenges between policymakers and technical
experts, focusing on national preparedness, strategies and
resilience. Moreover, this support included the enhancement
of the quality and usability of key national cyber/ICT security
information through the new POLIS website.
COMBATING TERRORISM
Building on the results of previous years, the 2018
OSCE-wide counter-terrorism conference focused on
challenges posed by returning and relocating foreign
terrorist fighters (FTFs). The event gathered more than
350 high-level participants, practitioners, academics

and civil society representatives. In addition, TNTD was
instrumental in organizing other high-level conferences
related to combating terrorism and violent extremism in
Dushanbe, Tashkent, Minsk and Seoul throughout 2018.
TNTD developed a series of tools to build the capacity of
policymakers and practitioners in P/CVERLT. In addition
to training courses, TNTD also developed two regionally
tailored guidebooks on the role of civil society in P/CVERLT
and started work on publications related to pre-criminal
interventions and referral mechanisms, as well as on gender
awareness for security sector actors in P/CVERLT.
In support of national efforts to counter terrorist financing,
a series of advanced training events and train-the-trainer
courses focusing on the analysis, investigation and financial
disruption of terrorist networks, as well as on UN sanctions
listings, continued in Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan, and
started in Albania and Tajikistan, all in close co-operation
with the Global Programme against Money Laundering of
the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime.
Three additional national risk assessment and crisis
management exercises on the protection of non-nuclear
critical energy infrastructure from terrorist attacks emanating
from cyberspace were held in Ashgabat, Astana and
Sarajevo.
In response to the exploitation of the Internet by violent
extremists and terrorists, a national seminar in Ashgabat

and a Central Asian regional workshop for judges,
prosecutors and lawmakers in Almaty were organized to
exchange best practices on preventing and countering the
use of the Internet for terrorist purposes.
Seminars on strengthening rule-of-law-compliant criminal
justice responses to terrorism were organized with
Kyrgyzstan and Montenegro based on the good practices
listed in the Global Counterterrorism Forum’s Rabat
Memorandum. TNTD continued to facilitate information
exchange through the OSCE Counter-Terrorism Network
by issuing informative circulars as well as six editions of its
newsletter.
BORDER SECURITY AND MANAGEMENT
Addressing the threat posed by returning FTFs and
countering illicit trafficking were in the focus in 2018.
The work of the OSCE mobile training team to address the
cross-border movement of FTFs expanded significantly
in 2018, with six training courses conducted – in Lviv and
Odesa (Ukraine), Skopje, Ashgabat, Dushanbe and Astana
– as well as five courses on the detection of fraudulent
documents and imposters, and a regional workshop to
improve passport security. These combined efforts help
states detect potential FTFs before they cross borders.
TNTD also provided direct capacity-building support to
establish national passenger data systems through the
drafting of roadmaps, legal advice and/or independent
tendering support to local authorities in eight countries.
These culminated in a thematic meeting of the OSCE’s
Border Security and Management National Focal Points,
which was organized on 1 and 2 November in Vienna
and brought together over 150 experts to examine ways
to prevent the movement of FTFs by implementing UN
Security Council Resolution 2396.
TNTD supported the Chairmanship’s priority of countering
illicit trafficking in cultural property. An exhibition at Vienna’s
Kunsthistorische Museum of recovered antiquities was
a highlight in this field, and it was supplemented by
specialized regional workshops for Central Asia, SouthEastern Europe and the South Caucasus, as well as a
national event in Turkmenistan.

“Gender parity in the Department’s
workforce is an important part of our
approach to gender mainstreaming
our internal structures. I’m therefore
proud to say that, in a sector that
still faces an underrepresentation of
women, the Transnational Threats
(OSCE/Micky Kroell)
Department has reached full gender
parity among its professional staff.”

services that are trusted by citizens and able to effectively
address transnational threats, including those emanating
from terrorism and organized crime. TNTD supported the
Chairmanship in organizing the 2018 OSCE-wide anti-drug
conference where the participants had a chance to explore
the effectiveness of drug control policies and innovative
approaches to reducing the supply of, and demand for, illicit
drugs.
TNTD assisted OSCE participating States in SouthEastern Europe and the South Caucasus in increasing
their capacities to address cybercrime by providing basic
and highly specialized training courses on cybercrime
issues such as the dark web, online drug trafficking,
cryptocurrencies and money laundering. TNTD launched
a pilot project to support Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania
in their fight against gender-based violence. By targeting
all criminal justice practitioners (police, prosecutors
and judges), as well as civil society, social workers and
academia, the project ensures a comprehensive approach
to gender-based violence.
The OSCE Police Academies Network (PAN) was launched
in Vienna in June. The PAN started an online platform
that offers an overview of police education and training,
thus facilitating the exchange and mutual use of existing
resources, including curricula, training materials and
expertise within law enforcement training institutions in the
OSCE area.

In addition to these priority areas, TNTD continued to
promote good practices in demarcation and delimitation of
borders, to expand co-operation with the Mediterranean
Partners for Co-operation and to expand joint activities on
gender mainstreaming in border services and on trafficking
in small arms and light weapons.

The Office of the Co-ordinator of OSCE Economic and Environmental Activities (OCEEA)
continued to implement all of its mandates in the economic and environmental dimension
in 2018 and embraced new topics such as digitalization, which was one of the Italian
Chairmanship’s priorities. The Office supported participating States in meeting their
objectives set by international frameworks, including the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable
Development, the Paris Agreement and the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction,
often in close co-operation with OSCE field operations, other departments of the OSCE
Secretariat and other international organizations.

GOOD ECONOMIC GOVERNANCE
The Office assisted Professor Paola Severino, the Special
Representative of the OSCE Chairperson-in-Office on
Combating Corruption, during her high-level meetings in
Albania, Armenia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Russian
Federation, Serbia and Ukraine. In addition, in partnership
with the Anti-Corruption Network of the Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the
OCEEA organized a regional seminar to discuss new
approaches and tools to prevent corruption at the local
level. Representatives from about 30 participating States
shared experiences on the prevention of corruption at the
local level. The OCEEA also organized training courses
for government officials, civil society organizations and
business representatives on anti-corruption proofing of
legislation in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, in cooperation with the OSCE Programme Office in Dushanbe.
The OCEEA continued its support for participating States
on anti-money laundering and combating the financing
of terrorism by strengthening their capacities in this
area. In Mongolia, the OCEEA trained members of law
enforcement agencies on best practices in countering
money laundering through offshore zones. In Belarus, the
Office held a workshop for the Department of Financial
Investigations on combating the misuse of the darknet and
cryptocurrencies for corruption and financial crimes. Austria
and other countries shared experiences with their financial
investigations of corruption-related crimes.
MIGRATION GOVERNANCE
Migration management impacts regional security,
development and growth. In 2018, the OCEEA supported
Central Asian participating States in reviewing their
migration policies and enhancing their effectiveness as
tools for economic stability, development and growth. A
workshop organized in co-operation with the IOM, the
United Nations Economic and Social Commission for
Asia and the Pacific (UNESCAP) and the International
Centre for Migration Policy Development (ICMPD) aimed to
38

facilitate labour mobility in the region, foster the exchange
of practices and develop pilot initiatives. Furthermore, the
OCEEA provided a platform to discuss migration as a
driving force for social cohesion and development through
seminars and an annual event to mark International Migrant
Day, which focused on promoting a multi-stakeholder
approach for the socio-economic integration of migrants.
ECONOMIC PARTICIPATION – WOMEN AND
YOUTH
The OCEEA pays special attention to the inclusion of
women and young people in its activities. The successful
implementation of the YDEAS project (Young Developers
and Entrepreneurs to Advance Start-ups in the Western
Balkans) offered an opportunity to reflect on how to
improve youth employability, including through focusing on
innovation and the digital economy. The long-term vision for
the region is to counteract brain drain among youth, while
fostering an environment for innovative start-ups.
In Central Asia, the OCEEA specifically supports women
and young people working in water management, an area
of critical importance for the region.
TRANSBOUNDARY WATER MANAGEMENT
Transboundary water co-operation is a priority issue for
the OCEEA with the increasing impacts of climate change
on water resources. In 2018, in the framework of the
Dniester/Nistru River project, the OCEEA, together with
the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP),
the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe
(UNECE) and respective field operations, supported the
establishment of the Moldova-Ukraine Dniester/Nistru
River Basin Commission. The project was funded by
the Global Environment Facility (GEF). The OCEEA also
helped organize the project’s first high-level meeting, which
brought together 70 governmental and non-governmental
stakeholders from Moldova, both right and left banks, and
Ukraine, as well as international and bilateral actors. The
OCEEA also organized a study tour to Portugal and Spain,

DIALOGUE ON DIGITALIZATION – THE OSCE’S ECONOMIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL FORUM AND
THE ECONOMIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL IMPLEMENTATION MEETING

Promoting economic progress and security in the OSCE area through innovation, human capital
development and good public and corporate governance was the focus of the 26th OSCE
Economic and Environmental Forum (EEF). The EEF is the major annual OSCE event dealing with
security questions in the economic and environmental dimension. More than 500 participants
attended the two preparatory meetings held in Vienna and Venice, as well as the concluding
meeting in Prague. The discussions focused on harnessing the opportunities of the digital
transition while curbing its negative security implications through human capital development.
The Economic and Environmental Dimension Implementation Meeting, which reviews
the implementation of commitments in the OSCE economic and environmental
dimension, focused on OSCE commitments in the field of energy, with one
session being dedicated to the energy sector in the era of digitalization.
The discussions contributed to the successful adoption of the Declaration on the Digital
Economy as a Driver for Promoting Co-operation, Security and Growth and the Decision on
Human Capital Development in the Digital Era by the 25th Ministerial Council meeting in Milan.
The opportunities and challenges of digitalization were also integrated into the
OCEEA’s work with participating States on trade and transport connectivity, e.g., with
two activities on e-commerce organized in Moldova and two national workshops
on digitalization of transit and trade documents held in Kazakhstan.

CLIMATE CHANGE AND SECURITY
The Office continued to closely follow global and regional
developments in the area of climate diplomacy. Building on
the results of its earlier activities, the Office also developed
a new project to address potential security risks stemming
from climate change in South-Eastern Europe, Eastern
Europe, the South Caucasus and Central Asia.

ENERGY SECURITY
The OCEEA continued to support participating
States with regard to the protection of critical energy
infrastructure and the promotion of renewable energy
and energy-efficiency measures as elements of energy
security strategies. In September 2018, the OCEEA
organized a field study to Iceland on geothermal
energy for energy decision makers from the public
and private sectors of several participating States.
Participants visited leading geothermal sites in the
country and exchanged views with representatives
from companies and national authorities on best
practices to utilize geothermal energy for increased
energy security and economic growth.

HAZARDOUS-WASTE MANAGEMENT
Abandoned uranium mining sites remain a significant
risk for communities in Central Asia. The OSCE has
long supported participating States in addressing these
risks. In 2018, the OCEEA successfully completed a joint
Environment and Security Initiative (ENVSEC) project with
the UNDP and UN Environment, which was aimed at
engaging stakeholders in the remediation of uranium legacy
sites in Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. The project
established four Public Environmental Information Centres
to serve communities in the vicinity of high-priority uranium
legacy sites – three in Kyrgyzstan and one in Uzbekistan.
It provided over 50 training sessions for more than 1,000
local stakeholders, engaged over 1,300 schoolchildren in
awareness-raising activities and prepared and distributed
thousands of radiation safety brochures. A follow-up project
is being prepared.
DISASTER RISK REDUCTION
Disaster risk reduction remained high on the OCEEA’s
agenda in 2018. The Chernobyl Wildfires Management
project was successfully concluded with a table-top
exercise for emergency management authorities from
Belarus and Ukraine preparing for an effective joint
response to wildfires in the affected areas. The OCEEA
extended its engagement to South-Eastern Europe through
a regional workshop to discuss wildfire management

Combating
trafficking in
human beings

Special Representative and Co-ordinator: Ambaassador Madina Jarbussvnova (until
2 July 2018)

From policy to practice, the Office of the Special Representative and Co-ordinator for
Combating Trafficking in Human Beings (OSR/CTHB) assists OSCE participating States in
their efforts to better prevent human trafficking, prosecute those who commit this heinous
crime and protect its victims. In 2018, the Office further developed core programmes
around areas of greatest need and potential impact, including trafficking in migration
flows, public procurement and supply chains, technology and trafficking, and trafficking of
children.

HUMAN TRAFFICKING IN MIGRATION FLOWS
Migrants, asylum seekers and refugees in migration flows
continue to face grave risks of human trafficking and
exploitation. The OSR/CTHB works to help tackle these
vulnerabilities through a combination of policy development
and pioneering capacity-building activities. In 2018, the
OSR/CTHB conducted three simulation training exercises,
including one for Italian practitioners, the first-ever Russianlanguage exercise and an additional English-language
exercise for experts from across the OSCE. This project
develops powerful and practical networks across borders
and disciplines, and it stands as an enduring example of
collaboration between anti-trafficking professionals and
participating States. Furthermore, the Office developed
uniform guidelines to help improve the identification of
victims of human trafficking in large movements of migrants
and refugees for first responders at migration and reception
centres across the OSCE region.
ENDING LABOUR TRAFFICKING THROUGH
CLEAN PUBLIC PROCUREMENT
In February 2018, the OSR/CTHB published its innovative
Model Guidelines on Government Measures to Prevent
Trafficking for Labour Exploitation in Supply Chains.
Building on extensive research and collaboration with
leading international practitioners in this field, the publication
provides practical guidance to participating States to
ensure that fair labour recruitment and transparency
practices are implemented in public procurement. Following
the publication, the Office launched a series of practical
workshops to promote useful guidance for achieving ethical
public procurement, beginning with an event for Central
Asian participating States hosted by Uzbekistan.
TECHNOLOGY AND TRAFFICKING: TURNING A
LIABILITY INTO AN ASSET
From victims recruited via social media to traffickers
exploiting victims on websites to illicit flows of
cryptocurrency, information and communication technology
is now at the heart of the human trafficking business
model. The OSR/CTHB has been at the forefront of turning
technology from a liability into an asset by conducting

research into the connections between technology
and trafficking, identifying over 200 promising digital
forensics tools, facial recognition software, blockchain
and mobile applications and other technology initiatives to
combat human trafficking and building ground-breaking
partnerships between the public and private sectors in
the field of technology. Recognizing the importance of
public-private partnerships, the OSR/CTHB has joined
new initiatives, such as the Advisory Group of Tech
Against Trafficking initiative, to fully leverage the potential of
technology to fight human trafficking.
CHILD VICTIMS OF TRAFFICKING
Children are especially vulnerable to human trafficking,
be it for child labour, sexual exploitation, early (forced)
marriage, organ removal, begging or forced criminality
such as transporting illegal drugs. Taking stock of the 2017
Alliance against Trafficking in Persons Conference on child
trafficking, the OSR/CTHB continued its strong emphasis
on combating trafficking of children in 2018 by:
 Conducting research into the sexual exploitation of
children in the context of tourism;

Valiant Richey, speaking at the Trust Conference in London organized by the
Thomson Reuters Foundation in November 2018. (Thomson Reuters Foundation)

In 2018, more than 190 law enforcement officials,
lawyers, prosecutors, labour inspectors, financial
and criminal investigators, journalists, public social
service providers, cultural mediators and civil society
representatives from 53 OSCE participating States
and five Partners for Co-operation participated in
three OSCE simulation-based trainings in Vicenza,
Italy, and Astana. These training courses sought
to improve cross-border co-operation, and the
identification and protection of victims, as well as
to increase the use of financial tools to investigate
traffickers and compensate victims. It provided
participants with a collaborative space that facilitates
co-operation and exchange among practitioners.
The simulations centred around cases of sexual
and labour exploitation among migrants, including
children, with a focus on investigation and prosecution,
while maintaining a victim-centred approach.
“The project is truly unique, and the results are
genuinely extraordinary. The border between reality
and simulation becomes increasingly blurred for all
candidates, and their learning is all the better for it.”

COUNTRY VISITS
In 2018, the Office continued to conduct country visits to
identify best practices, offer helpful insight and establish a
constructive dialogue with governments, parliamentarians,
members of the judiciary, international organizations and
NGOs. It carried out country and follow-up visits to several
OSCE participating States, including Austria, Cyprus and
Uzbekistan. Country visit reports for Denmark, Mongolia
and the Russian Federation were also published.

Following a raid by criminal investigators, a simulated arrest of criminals
involved in trafficking of migrant victims takes place during the second
simulation-based training on combating human trafficking along migration
routes, Center of Excellence for Stability Police Units (CoESPU), Vicenza,
Italy, 8 June 2017. (Italian Carabinieri)

FOSTERING MULTILAYERED PARTNERSHIPS
Due to its complex and often transnational nature, no
state can tackle human trafficking on its own. Developing
partnerships both among practitioners and between states
is thus a prerequisite for any viable anti-trafficking strategy.
To this end, the 18th Alliance against Trafficking in Persons
Conference in April 2018 focused on promoting the use
of innovative and inclusive collaboration between national
agencies and civil society actors whose expertise can
make a significant contribution in curbing the crime and
assisting its victims, including financial investigators, private
businesses and healthcare professionals.

www.oscepa.org/secretariat/gender

Gender equality is an important cross-dimensional component of the OSCE’s
comprehensive approach to security. The Organization has continued to build internal
capacities to better gender-mainstream its activities in all three dimensions of security and
to support participating States in specific areas such as implementing the women, peace
and security agenda, empowering women in the digital economy and combating violence
against women.

THE GENDER FOCAL POINTS NETWORK
The OSCE Gender Section co-ordinates an Organizationwide network of Gender Focal Points (GFPs). Currently,
there are 83 GFPs across the Organization. Their role
is essential for the gender mainstreaming of OSCE
programmes and activities: they provide in-house capacity
to enhance knowledge and skills on gender equality
and advise OSCE staff members on how to implement
gender commitments in practice. The GFPs also support
the Gender Section in measuring the progress made in
implementing the 2004 OSCE Action Plan for the Promotion
of Gender Equality.

“There is a need to empower women
who aspire to enter the security sector.
Training is a first step, but it is not
enough. We must all work towards
introducing measures that create
enabling conditions, support diversity
and challenge social and gender
(OSCE/Micky Kroell)
relations in security sector workplaces
that may be discriminatory.”

16 DAYS OF ACTIVISM AGAINST
GENDER-BASED VIOLENCE
Whether in public or private, at
home, in the workplace or along
migration routes, violence against
women is a global pandemic
that remains one of the most
widespread human rights violations
around the globe, including in the
OSCE area. The OSCE participated
in the global 16 Days of Activism
against Gender-Based Violence
campaign from 25 November
to 10 December 2018 to raise
awareness of the importance of
combating gender-based violence
and supporting women. Through
a comprehensive communications
campaign on social media,
information was shared about the
OSCE’s work to combat violence
against women and girls at field
operations, institutions and the
Secretariat, as well as on initiatives
such as the OSCE MenEngage

WOMEN MENTORING WOMEN: TAKING STOCK
OF FIVE YEARS OF MENTORING NETWORKS

Participants from Turkmenistan during an OSCE workshop on women, peace

WOMEN, PEACE AND SECURITY
Support for the implementation of UNSCR 1325 on Women,
Peace and Security in the participating States is a priority
area and a long-term commitment for the OSCE. A multicountry workshop in Vienna and a tailored workshop
in Armenia were organized in 2018. These workshops
increased governmental and non-governmental actors’
knowledge and technical capacities to prepare resultsbased action plans on UNSCR 1325 in their home
countries.
Women’s low participation in the security sector continues
to be a challenge in the OSCE area. To address this, the
Gender Section assisted the Italian OSCE Chairmanship
in organizing a one-day conference called Women in
the Security Sector: Challenges and Opportunities for
the OSCE Area and Beyond. The conference offered an
opportunity to share the good practices that participating
States and international organizations have developed to
address this challenge. A list of recommendations based
on discussions at the conference was distributed to all
participating States and Partners for Co-operation.

Mentoring and networking are powerful tools for
women to increase their participation in political,
economic and social life. Since 2013, the OSCE,
working closely with the civil society organizations
KVINFO from Denmark and the European Movement
from Serbia, has supported the creation of mentoring
networks that are based on the principle of women
supporting women to advance their career and
life goals. Over the past five years, the OSCE has
supported the establishment of six networks, which
have reached more than 200 women throughout the
OSCE region, from Roma women and women living
in rural areas, to female police officers and lawyers.

ENSURING WOMEN’S EMPOWERMENT IN THE
DIGITAL ECONOMY
Digitalization has had wide-ranging effects on social,
political and economic structures, and thus on security, in
the whole OSCE region. Global awareness is emerging of
the relationship between gender and digital technologies, as
well as of opportunities that are arising for the achievement
of the SDGs. However, various barriers remain for women
to equally benefit from developments in this area. To
address such imbalances, a high-level international
conference called Digital Transformation – Challenges and
Opportunities for Women to Shape Economic Progress
in the OSCE Area analysed persisting and newly arising
inequalities constraining women's meaningful participation
in the economy. A list of recommendations was drafted
to support participating States in developing tangible and
adequate policy responses.
COMBATING VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN
Work on the OSCE Survey on the Well-being and Safety of
Women initiated in 2015 continued through field research
in Eastern and South-Eastern Europe. The results of the
survey, which will increase the understanding of women’s
experience of violence in conflict and non-conflict situations,
will be launched on 6 March 2019.

As the primary institution within the OSCE focusing on the human dimension of security,
the Warsaw-based Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) provides
support, assistance and expertise to governments and civil society in OSCE participating
States to promote democracy, the rule of law, human rights, tolerance and nondiscrimination and Roma and Sinti issues.

“We need to pay close attention to the
setbacks and negative trends we are
witnessing in the human dimension. These
setbacks are a cause of great concern, and
we must safeguard the main principles of
democracy – rule of law, strong democratic
institutions and practices, free and fair
elections – which all go hand in hand and
are equally important to ensure respect
for human rights for all in line with OSCE
commitments.”

ELECTIONS
ODIHR continues to support democratic elections across
the OSCE region. In 2018, ODIHR observed elections
and referendums in 16 participating States. Over the
year, the Office published some 60 election-related
reports, comprehensively assessing electoral processes
for consistency with OSCE commitments, international
obligations and other standards. Importantly, final reports
provided recommendations to participating States on
how their elections could be improved. In 2018, the Office
supported 18 participating States in their efforts to address
ODIHR’s electoral recommendations by providing technical
expertise during country visits or reviewing proposed
amendments to electoral legislation. ODIHR additionally
supported participating States through the training of
election observers, convening the first-ever meeting of
national focal points to discuss good practices related to
the secondment and deployment of election observers,
and hosting the annual Election Seminar, with a focus on
election campaigning.

DEMOCRATIZATION
Throughout 2018, ODIHR continued to support judicial
independence and accountability, as well as diversity within
the judiciary. The Office’s democratic governance work
focused on promoting parliamentary ethics and oversight,
improving frameworks regulating political parties and
non-governmental organizations, strengthening the role
of women in decision-making processes and promoting
their political participation, as well as that of other underrepresented groups, such as young people and persons
with disabilities.
ODIHR assisted in ensuring the quality and effectiveness
of laws related to the human dimension through
expert review of 19 pieces of draft legislation from 15
different OSCE participating States, including Albania,
Hungary, Kazakhstan, Lithuania, Montenegro, Poland
and Uzbekistan, on issues spanning from freedom of
association, political parties, the judiciary and freedom
of religion or belief to hate crimes. ODIHR also worked

to assist states in further promoting the transparency,
openness and inclusiveness of their lawmaking processes.
This work was complemented by improvements to ODIHR’s
online legislative database (legislationline.org), which
helps participating States bring their legislation in line with
international human rights standards. Throughout the year,
ODIHR responded to requests for support in the field of
migration, providing capacity-building and awarenessraising activities, generating policy recommendations on
emerging migration-related challenges and publishing
an important new resource, Good Practices in Migrant
Integration: A Trainer's Manual.

within a Human Rights Framework; and a report on the
situation of women in the armed forces in the OSCE region.
Supplementary Human Dimension Meetings during the year
focused on the topics of child trafficking, violence against
women and human rights and education.

HUMAN RIGHTS
In 2018, ODIHR undertook assessments of the situation
of human rights defenders in participating States and
conducted country visits to examine states’ institutional and
policy frameworks to combat trafficking in human beings.
ODIHR continued to monitor peaceful assemblies, bringing
to 30 the total number of states that have been the sites
of such missions to date. ODIHR provided assistance to
state and non-state actors in the form of capacity-building
and expert advice, addressing issues of human rights
and counter-terrorism, human rights-compliant policing of
assemblies, freedom of religion or belief, torture prevention,
mainstreaming gender and human rights in the security
sector, combating trafficking in human beings, human rights
education and the protection of human rights defenders,
including national human rights institutions. Examples of
new tools developed for participating States included the
Guidance Document on the Nelson Mandela Rules, a
publication that lays out the standard minimum rules for
the treatment of prisoners; new Guidelines for Addressing
the Threats and Challenges of "Foreign Terrorist Fighters"

48

TOLERANCE AND NON-DISCRIMINATION
ODIHR continued to work closely with participating States
and civil society throughout the year to promote tolerance
and non-discrimination. In November, ODIHR published
data on hate crime and hate incidents on its dedicated
website (hatecrime.osce.org). The Office also launched
a new programme, the Information Against Hate Crimes
Toolkit (INFAHCT), as part of its efforts to strengthen
government collection and management of hate crime data.
This was complemented by the publication of a toolkit to
help participating States adopt a comprehensive approach
to addressing hate crime.
The Office continued its efforts to counter racism,
xenophobia, anti-Semitism and intolerance against Muslims
and Christians, including by publishing a new factsheet
on hate crimes against Christians. ODIHR and UNESCO
published educational policy guidelines designed to help
teachers address anti-Semitism in classrooms. ODIHR also
began offering workshops to support strong and diverse
civil society coalitions, accompanying the new publication
Coalition Building for Tolerance and Non-Discrimination: A
Practical Guide. Both of these publications were published
as part of the Turning Words into Action to Address AntiSemitism project, funded by Germany.

the Implementation of the OSCE Action Plan on Roma and
Sinti, with a special focus on steps that participating States
are taking to enhance Roma and Sinti participation in public
and political life. During the HDIM in September, the Office
organized a side event on racism, intolerance and violence
against Roma and Sinti in the OSCE region. In Vienna in
October, the Office organized an event on access to quality
education for Roma and Sinti children and youth. Together
with the Chairperson of the Human Dimension Committee,
ODIHR’s Contact Point on Roma and Sinti Issues also
organized an event called Roma and Sinti: Girls Education
in Vienna in April.

One hundred women leaders gathered to explore
challenges and ways forward towards women’s
empowerment at the Second International Forum
of Women Leaders in Minsk in October. The Forum
was part of the Office’s Promoting Democratization
and Human Rights in Belarus project, funded by the
European Union.
Women state officials, parliamentarians, entrepreneurs,
academics, civil society activists and gender experts
from 21 OSCE participating States, including all
member states of the Commonwealth of Independent
States, took part in the event. Discussions focused
on topics such as women’s participation in politics
and the economic sphere, combating violence against
women, strengthening women's networks and coalitionbuilding, and equal opportunities at universities.

ODIHR delivered two four-day training courses for trainers
in Poland and Slovakia on effective and human-rightscompliant policing in Roma and Sinti communities for law
enforcement officers. A similar two-day course was offered
in Pristina. ODIHR continued its work to enhance access to
civil registration and identity documents for Roma and Sinti,
and in June published a baseline study report titled Access
to Personal Documents for Roma in Ukraine: More Efforts
Needed. At the Second Practical OSCE-UNHCR Seminar
on Sharing Good Practices on Statelessness among OSCE
participating States, which was held in October, obstacles
and solutions were discussed among experts at the
technical level.

High
Commissioner
on National
Minorities

High Commissioner: Ambassador Lamberto Zannier
Budget: €3,466,300 (Unified budget), €712,059 (Extrabudgetary expenditure)
Staff: 20 international, 11 local (including five under extrabudgetary projects)
www.osce.org/hcnm

In response to the inter-ethnic hostilities that affected Eastern Europe in the early
1990s, the position of the OSCE High Commissioner on National Minorities (HCNM) was
established in 1992 as a security mechanism to prevent any future conflict involving
national minorities. Today, the High Commissioner travels the length and breadth of the
OSCE area to identify the first signs of acute crisis involving national minorities, as well
as underlying causes that, if neglected, could potentially lead to violent conflict within
or among the OSCE participating States. In 2018, High Commissioner Lamberto Zannier
continued his long-term approach to conflict prevention using a combination of quiet
diplomacy, high-profile initiatives and public debates.

PROMOTING INTEGRATION OVERCOMES DIVISIONS
IN SOCIETY
Sound integration policies promote harmonious relations
and social cohesion. Therefore, promoting integration at
the policy level in areas such as education and language
is paramount for the High Commissioner. In 2018, High
Commissioner Zannier worked tirelessly with governments
and parliaments to amend existing legislation and to draft
new laws related to language and education. Throughout
the year, the High Commissioner continued to be actively
engaged with Ukraine, which he visited twice, including
the Zakarpattia region in the west of the country. In the
course of these visits, he engaged with the government,
local institutions and representatives of minority groups on
a number of areas key to successful integration of society.
In May, a publication titled Language Policy and Conflict
Prevention comprising 15 academic papers was launched
at an event held in Oslo, marking the 20th anniversary of the
HCNM’s Oslo Recommendations regarding the Linguistic
Rights of National Minorities (1998). During the presentation,
the HCNM highlighted that a carefully formulated language
policy is also a conflict prevention policy.

associations in the city of Ferghana and the Ferghana Region give a warm welcome

“Identity politics and socio-political polarization are
growing, resulting in the marginalization of some
minority groups, a dynamic that has the potential
to lead to crisis and conflict. For this reason, it is
important to scale up conflict prevention efforts.”
Lamberto Zannier
OSCE High Commissioner on National Minorities

Learning the official language of a country is as vital as
having access to education in one’s own language: full
participation in public and political life can depend on
it. To promote full civic inclusion, the HCNM supported
internships in the main political parties in Georgia for young
people belonging to national minorities. Preparations
also began for the 20th-anniversary celebration in Lund,
Sweden, next year of The Lund Recommendations on the
Effective Participation of National Minorities in Public Life
(1999). The Tallinn Guidelines on National Minorities and the
Media in the Digital Age were also finalized, ready for their
launch in Tallinn on 13 February 2019.
NATIONAL MINORITIES AND INTER-STATE
RELATIONS
When inter-state disputes occur, national minorities on
different sides of the border are often caught in the middle,
with conflicting loyalties. In June, a panel discussion to
celebrate the 10th anniversary of The Bolzano/Bozen
Recommendations on National Minorities and Inter-State
Relations (2008) presented an opportunity for academics,
practitioners and stakeholders to come together in Udine,
Italy, to review these recommendations. States that find
themselves in this situation can learn from good practices:
when travelling in Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan in April,
High Commissioner Zannier noted the positive impact that
improved bilateral relations and newly opened bordercrossing points in the Ferghana Valley are having on
regional relations.

25TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE HCNM
In 2018, the office of the HCNM celebrated the 25th anniversary of the appointment of the first High
Commissioner on National Minorities, Max van der Stoel, in combination with the 2018 Max van der
Stoel Award ceremony. To mark this milestone, a public photo exhibition illustrating the HCNM’s
work was displayed at the Peace Palace and The Hague City Hall; a book of photos and a publication
entitled HCNM at 25: Personal Reflections of the High Commissioners were also published.
“It is worth standing alone sometimes, it is worth fighting the invisible, and it is worth being patient.”

EDUCATION CAN BUILD BRIDGES BETWEEN
COMMUNITIES
The office of the HCNM has traditionally supported
education programmes aimed at integration and diversity
management. The Bujanovac Department of the Subotica
Faculty of Economics at Novi Sad University is one such
initiative. As the first multilingual, multi-ethnic higher
education institution in southern Serbia, it offers bilingual
study programmes. It is therefore a flagship for multilingual
education (MLE) in the region. At the primary-school level,
the illustrated Serbian-Albanian and Albanian-Serbian,
as well as the Macedonian-Albanian and AlbanianMacedonian Dictionaries developed by the HCNM –
another first – grew in popularity, with 81,448 website visits
and over 2,088 mobile app downloads in 2018. In Serbia,
the HCNM is now working with pupils to upgrade these
dictionaries by including pupils’ illustrations and additional
audio recordings, thereby involving children, the end users,
in improving the dictionaries.
Several milestones were reached under the HCNM’s
Central Asia Education Programme, including a roundtable
on multilingual education in Uzbekistan (April) co-organized
with the Ministries of Public and Higher Education, a
roundtable and two seminars in Ulaanbaatar and Ulgij
(October) as a result of extending the HCNM’s co-operation
on MLE to Mongolia and a five-day regional winter school
in Almaty, Kazakhstan (December), which brought together
MLE policymakers and practitioners from all over Central
Asia and Mongolia.

ACCESS TO JUSTICE AND NATIONAL
MINORITIES
The HCNM continued to promote awareness of the
institution’s latest set of thematic advice, The Graz
Recommendations on Access to Justice and National
Minorities, and organized roundtables in Tbilisi (September)
and Chisinau (October). Russian and Romanian translations
of the Graz Recommendations were launched on both
occasions, to increase their accessibility.

(OSCE/María Diego Gordón)

“My focus is on ensuring that the current HCNM guidelines
and recommendations are better known and actively used
by governments as guiding principles for a positive impact
on minorities and the increasingly diverse societies in
which we all live.”

Representative
on Freedom of
the Media

Representative: Harlem Désir
Budget: €1,519,800 (Unified budget), €510,401 (Extrabudgetary expenditure)
Staff: 13
www.osce.org/representative-on-freedom-of-media

2018 marked the 70th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Article 19
of which grants everyone the right to freedom of opinion and expression and is the basis
for freedom of the media. The Representative’s mandate is to observe media-freedom
developments in OSCE participating States and to advocate and promote full compliance
with the Organization’s principles and commitments in respect of freedom of expression
and free media.

MAJOR ISSUES
In 2018, the Representative continued previous years’
efforts and continued to make the safety of journalists
his number one priority by intervening in cases of threats
and intimidation against journalists, attacks, arson and
physical violence, including murder. In what has become
a deteriorating safety environment for media workers,
the Representative’s work was dominated by the safety
of journalists, including distinct risks faced by women
journalists in relation to their work including through
digital technologies. During the reporting period, the
Representative made over 400 interventions by various
means such as letters to authorities, country visits, press
releases and through social media.
Through the Safety of Female Journalists Online (#SOFJO)
campaign and the recent documentary film A Dark
Place, general awareness of this issue was broadened.
Furthermore, a large-scale research project was carried out
in order to identify solutions and collect data on policies that
better protect journalists.
The second-biggest issue on which the Representative

intervened concerned journalists’ ability to report without
fear of legal repercussions, the foremost of which is
imprisonment for journalistic work, investigation or
publication of critical views. As of the end of 2018, more
than 150 journalists were still in prison, compared to 170 in
2017.
Another key area in which numerous interventions
took place concerns media regulations in the name of
national security and countering extremism, followed
by disproportionate restrictions on media freedom and
freedom of expression. From the blocking of websites
to surveillance and forced disclosure of confidential
sources, security is still too often used for sweeping
restrictions on freedom of expression online. The issues
of fake news, disinformation and the promotion of quality
of information and media literacy were discussed at the
regional conferences organized by the Representative in
Struga, Tbilisi, Astana and at the conference organized
in Kyiv. These thematic areas were also included in the
recommendations presented after the conferences. In
2018, the Representative’s Office provided 13 legal reviews
for 10 countries on draft laws that impact freedom of the

Turkish Cypriot journalists that started last year, the Office
organized an exhibition of work produced by young
journalists in Nicosia. In close co-operation with the unions
of journalists on the island, the Representative launched a
trilingual (English, Greek and Turkish) glossary of sensitive
words used by the media, the production of which was
supported by the Office with expertise from the Ethical
Journalism Network.

STRENGTHENING PROFESSIONAL
JOURNALISM AND PROMOTING DIALOGUE
BETWEEN JOURNALISTS
In 2018, the Representative continued to promote the
dialogue between Russian and Ukrainian journalists initiated
by the Office in 2014. Representatives of the two countries’
journalists’ unions met for a roundtable discussion at the
OSCE Secretariat in Vienna to discuss the current state of
affairs regarding the safety of journalists in eastern Ukraine
and Crimea, promoting quality journalism in their respective
countries and a number of other common projects and
activities.
A group of young journalists from Russia and Ukraine,
together with senior representatives of the journalists’
unions, participated in a media production workshop in
Vienna. The journalists worked together to complete the
production of a joint documentary film that they began
working on during a previous workshop in June 2017.
The Office continued a dialogue in an effort to assist in
improving developments in ethical standards and selfregulation mechanisms in Cyprus. As part of the exchange

CONFERENCES
The Office organized annual regional media conferences
for OSCE participating States in South-Eastern Europe (in
Struga), the South Caucasus (in Tbilisi) and Central Asia
(in Astana), bringing together media practitioners to share
experiences with colleagues, government authorities and
international experts.
During a study tour to Berlin that the Office organized
together with the OSCE Project Co-ordinator in Ukraine,
a dozen Ukrainian media experts on media self-regulation
met with key media regulators in Germany to discuss how
possible solutions to address specific challenges and
practices could be applied in their home country.
The expert conference Strengthening Media Freedom
and Pluralism in Ukraine during Times of Conflict in
and around the Country, held in Kyiv in June, brought
together more than 200 media professionals, government
and civil society representatives, inter-governmental
officers, renowned international experts and journalists.
They discussed the challenges they face with regard to
the media environment in the country and suggested
ways to promote freedom of expression, access to
quality information and freedom of the media in Ukraine,
in particular in the context of the crisis in and around
Ukraine.
The Office took part in the OSCE’s HDIM in Warsaw with
two side events: one called “Professional Journalism:
Survival in the Age of Globalized Information” and a
second on the #SOFJO project, where journalists and
experts from international and civil society organizations
had the chance to discuss and share experiences.
The Office organized its first Central Asia Judicial Dialogue,
in Bishkek, bringing together judges representing higher
and appellate courts from Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan,
Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan and international experts
to discuss the balance between preserving freedom of
expression and legislative measures countering violent
extremism.

The OSCE’s field operations assist host countries in putting their OSCE commitments
into practice and fostering local capacities through specific projects that respond to their
needs. Activities vary with the context of the individual field operation and host country,
and are governed by the mandate of each field operation. The field operations enable the
OSCE to manage crises and to play a critical post-conflict role, helping restore trust among
affected communities. A number of field operations contribute to early warning and conflict
prevention, and some also monitor and report on developments on the ground.

Presence in
Albania

Head of Presence: Ambassador Bernd Borchardt
Budget: €2,917,900 (Unified budget), €431,747 (Extrabudgetary expenditure)
Staff: 19 international, 67 local (including two under extrabudgetary projects)
www.osce.org/presence-in-albania

Among other activities, the OSCE Presence in Albania focused in 2018 on providing
support to electoral and justice system reform, preventing violent extremism and fighting
crime and corruption in Albania. The Presence continued contributing to the strengthening
of state institutions, particularly the Parliament, while also supporting the active
engagement of civil society and youth, as well as mainstreaming a gender perspective into
all of its programmatic work.

ANTI-CORRUPTION
In 2018, the Presence continued its multidimensional
assistance to the government in implementing Albania’s
National Strategy and Action Plan against Corruption. It
provided technical expertise to the Albanian School of
Public Administration to train 200 local-level public officials
on good governance, anti-corruption and risk management.
It also assisted the High Inspectorate for the Declaration
and Audit of Assets and Conflicts of Interest in enabling 240
private businesses to report corruption through whistleblower protection mechanisms.
JUSTICE REFORM
As part of the justice system reform process in Albania, the
Presence provided technical expertise to the institutions
carrying out the re-evaluation of judges and prosecutors,
ensuring the application of good international fair-trial
standards. Furthermore, the Presence assisted the re-

evaluation bodies in planning for the introduction of a
sustainable and efficient electronic case management
system.
COUNTERING VIOLENT EXTREMISM (CVE)
In its continued contribution to P/CVERLT, the Presence
supported the work of the Albanian Co-ordination Centre
for CVE and tackled the phenomenon in various forms. It
trained 210 first-line prison and probation staff based on
a training module developed by the Presence specifically
for this purpose. In addition to reaching out to more than
140 young people from around Albania to enhance their
understanding of violent extremism, the Presence helped
build the University of Tirana’s capacities by drafting a CVE
curriculum at the level of a master’s programme.
BORDER MANAGEMENT AND TRANSNATIONAL
THREATS
The Presence continued its support for the Albanian State
Police (ASP) in building an integrated border management
system. The Presence supported the ASP in particular in
setting up an advanced passenger information (API) system
and improving co-operation with neighbours for effective
information exchange to tackle transnational threats. For
the first time, the ASP received training on the use of the
Internet and technology for the detection of trafficking in
human beings, with support from the Presence.
ANTI-TRAFFICKING
Throughout 2018, the Presence supported the country’s
efforts to combat trafficking and exploitation of human
beings, with a particular focus on children. It made a major
contribution in developing a national action plan on the
protection of children from economic exploitation, as well as
in co-ordinating institutional efforts to identify and protect
child victims or children at risk of exploitation.

co-ordination and dialogue between civil society and the
government, which ultimately led to the approval of the first
National Action Plan on UNSCR 1325 (Women, Peace and
Security).

SECURITY OF LOCAL COMMUNITIES
The Presence continued engaging with Albanian institutions
at the central and local level to encourage a closer
collaboration between the citizens and the State through
community engagement in addressing security concerns.
The Presence contributed to the recently adopted
Community Policing Document and assisted Local Safety
Councils in designing security action plans that will guide
their future work.

ASSEMBLY SUPPORT
The Presence worked with parliamentary committees to
improve the Parliament’s legislative and oversight functions,
organizing outreach meetings between members of
parliament and local administrations, civil society and field
experts on institutional accountability. The Presence and
ODIHR supported the drafting of the recently adopted
Code of Conduct for Parliamentarians, which is expected
to produce concrete results in advancing transparency and
mitigating conflicts of interest in the Albanian parliament.
COURT EFFICIENCY
The Presence continued to work closely with the district
courts throughout Albania in the framework of its “Justice
Without Delays” initiative, promoting the application of
active case management techniques and strengthening cooperation between courts and local institutions to reduce
unnecessary delays. This work improved productivity
and shortened the length of proceedings in many of the
country’s courts.
ELECTORAL REFORM
Focusing on addressing the ODIHR’s recommendations
on elections, the Presence assisted the ad hoc Committee
on Electoral Reform in holding eight technical workshops
with state institutions, civil society and top-level international
experts. In addition, the Presence contributed to coordinating stakeholders’ work on gender equality in political
representation and women’s participation in decisionmaking in Albania, resulting in a joint draft proposal on
improving the gender quota that was presented to the
Committee.

LOCAL SELF GOVERNANCE
Throughout 2018, the Presence assisted the newly
established anti-cannabis task forces of Vlora and Shkodra
in organizing awareness-raising activities and presenting
alternative development methods to affected communities,
involving 449 participants in total.

YOUTH IN ACTION
In 2018, the Presence established a Youth Advisory
Group (YAG), a youth mainstreaming instrument
designed to incorporate youth perspectives into the
Presence’s policies, plans and activities. The YAG
currently works to identify the needs, challenges and
priorities of young people and to support initiatives
taken by the Presence to tackle them.

Budget: €11,647,200 (Unified budget), €1,469,232 (Extrabudgetary expenditure)
Staff: 34 international, 289 local
http://www.osce.org/bih

The OSCE Mission to Bosnia and Herzegovina continued to play a vital role in enhancing
Bosnia and Herzegovina’s ability to foster a sustainable and stable security environment, to
strengthen environmental governance and to encourage its consolidation as a democratic
society governed by the rule of law. The Mission supported key reforms and worked to
promote and protect the human rights of every citizen.

QUALITY AND NON-DISCRIMINATORY
EDUCATION
The Mission launched a report on the phenomenon
of “two schools under one roof”, containing a set of
recommendations aimed at ending this most visible form
of discrimination in education, while protecting the ethnic
identities of the Bosniak and Croat peoples. Moreover, the
Mission engaged students and parents to reflect on positive
and negative practices in education. Their consolidated
recommendations and messages are being communicated
to newly appointed authorities.
STRENGTHENING THE RULE OF LAW
The Mission issued its first public report based on trial
monitoring of 67 completed corruption cases during the
period 2010-2017, providing a comprehensive assessment
and key recommendations regarding issues negatively
impacting corruption trials. The domestic institutions
endorsed the recommendations, and the High Judicial
and Prosecutorial Council included several in its newest
action plan. The Mission also issued a short report entitled
Observations on the National War Crimes Processing
Strategy and its 2018 Draft Revisions, which analysed
the backlog in the processing of war crimes cases,
raised public awareness about successes and identified
recommendations for further progress.

SUPPORTING ANTI-CORRUPTION
AT ALL GOVERNMENT LEVELS
The Mission continued supporting all levels of
government in fighting corruption through strengthening
co-ordination between anti-corruption teams at
cantonal and entity levels, and by building the capacity
of approximately 500 civil servants. Also, the Mission
supported the development and launch of a public
registry of more than 3,000 civil servants appointed to
approximately 300 commissions, steering or executive
boards in the Sarajevo canton. The goal was to increase
transparency and to detect and prevent possible
conflicts of interest. Within one day, 20 appointment
irregularities were reported and since July 2018,
16 conflict-of-interest cases have been detected,
eight of which resulted in official resignations.

RESPONDING TO HATE CRIMES
With Mission support, the Criminal Code of the Federation
of Bosnia and Herzegovina (FBiH) was amended in 2016 to
include hate crimes provisions. In 2018, following continued
Mission advocacy and technical support for the prosecution
of hate crimes, the first ever final verdict for a hate crime in
the FBiH was issued.
SECURITY CO-OPERATION
The Mission promoted a holistic approach to security sector
governance and reform through capacity building and the
creation of strategic frameworks on cyber/ICT security,
countering violent extremism, disaster risk reduction and
integrated border management, intended for both the
broader security sector and civil society. The Mission also
upgraded the physical security of weapons and ammunition
storage sites managed by the Armed Forces of BiH and
improved ammunition life-cycle management capacities
through establishing a laboratory for the chemical testing of
ammunition.

YOUTH MAINSTREAMING
The Youth Advisory Group continued to provide meaningful
participation opportunities for young people from across
BiH in the Mission’s work and for the inclusion of their
diverse and age-unique perspectives in the planning and
implementation of our programmes.
ENVIRONMENTAL AWARENESS
The Mission supported the submission of BiH’s longoverdue Aarhus Convention National Implementation
Report for 2014-2017. It also supported a project of the
Aarhus Centre Sarajevo, which trains secondary school
students on methods of upcycling and the principles of
a circular economy. The Mission organized public cleanups and promoted dialogue between local authorities,
the private sector, citizens and environmental groups on
improving waste management and tackling dangerous
levels of air pollution in the city of Tuzla.

“Segregation is a bad investment” is the motto of
the group of students from Jajce who received the
2018 Max van der Stoel Award from the OSCE High
Commissioner on National Minorities in recognition
of their battle against further divisions in education.
The students, who had been supported by the
Mission in their lobbying and outreach efforts, were
rewarded for their courage and tenacity. “It is an
unprecedented victory which deserves to be widely
promoted as a positive example of how non-formal
groups with limited resources can achieve progress
where formal channels fail”, said the award panel.

Commission to improve the integrity of the electoral
process, including by donating 10,000 translucent ballot
boxes, providing training for all members of Municipal
Election Commissions and supporting the supervision of
training for polling station committees.
#MTC: MEDIA AND TERRORISM CONFERENCE
The Mission organized the international #MTC: Media
and Terrorism Conference, bringing together lecturers
and over 100 media and counter-terrorism experts from
across the region. The conference featured sessions
on responsible reporting on terrorism in online and
print media; ethics and dealing with sources; analysis
of social media in the radicalization process; and
terrorism and electronic media. Participants exchanged
strategies and approaches for reporting on terrorist
activity, keeping in mind that media coverage of
terrorism can have far-reaching social consequences.

MEDIA FREEDOM
The Mission promoted media literacy among students,
especially those who were first-time voters in the 2018
general elections. Training courses were organized for
students from all public universities in BiH to help better

COUNTERING VIOLENT EXTREMISM AND
RADICALIZATION THAT LEAD TO TERRORISM
In 2018, the Mission supported the government in drafting
and implementing national strategies and action plans for
countering violent extremism and terrorism. The Mission
worked with secondary-school staff, students, and youth to
increase awareness and promote early detection of violent
extremism and radicalization, and with religious leaders and
the police to increase co-operation on preventing violent
extremism.
EMPOWERING YOUTH THROUGH EDUCATION
The Mission sought to promote inclusive education that
fosters interaction and mutual understanding in the spirit of
the Ohrid Framework Agreement. At the grass-roots level,
the Mission supported inter-ethnic activities in schools
through the Building Bridges Project. The Mission also
continued to support the Regional Youth Co-operation
Office and its initiatives, local youth councils, and the
Agency for Youth and Sport.
PARTNERSHIPS
The Mission worked closely with national and local
authorities and agencies, political parties, civil society
organizations, religious communities, media associations,
diplomatic missions and international organizations.
The Mission also co-operated closely with OSCE
field operations in South-Eastern Europe, ODIHR, the
Representative on Freedom of the Media and the High
Commissioner on National Minorities in organizing joint
conferences and thematic events. Furthermore, the Mission
signed memoranda of understanding (MoU) outlining
planned joint activities with the Ministry of Education,
Ministry of Labour and Social Policy and Ministry of
Information Society and Administration, as well as the
Association of Journalists, the Agency for Community
Rights Realization, the Agency for Youth and Sports and the
State Election Commission, and it prepared an MoU with
the parliament.

Mission to
Moldova

Head of Mission: Ambassador Michael Scanlan (until August 2018) and
Claus Neukirch (from September 2018)
Budget: €2,263,900 (Unified budget), €168,745 (Extrabudgetary expenditure)
Staff: 13 international, 39 local

In 2018, the Transdniestrian settlement process facilitated by the OSCE Mission to Moldova
saw remarkable progress. The local ownership, leadership and political will demonstrated
by Chisinau and Tiraspol made it possible to find practical solutions to a number of issues
that had not been addressed in decades. These solutions have improved the day-to-day
life of students, teachers, farmers and entrepreneurs on both banks of the Dniester/Nistru
River. The structure of the six agreements in the "package of eight" that have been signed
and implemented since November 2017 contains a formula for a final settlement in line
with the parameters endorsed by all 57 OSCE participating States: the territorial integrity
and sovereignty of the Republic of Moldova, with a special status for Transdniestria within
Moldova. The progress achieved in 2018 was also a result of close co-operation between the
Mission, consecutive OSCE Chairmanships and the co-mediators and observers in the 5+2
negotiation process.

SETTLEMENT PROGRESS ADVANCES AT ALL
LEVELS
In addition to the opening of the Gura Bicului-Bychok
Bridge, the Sides implemented agreements in the fields
of transportation, education and access to private
property. The constructive approach and dedication of
the two chief negotiators and experts that make up the
13 working groups, as well as the personal engagement
of the Moldovan and Transdniestrian leadership, ensured
continued progress and ownership of the process.
As of 1 September 2018, vehicles from Transdniestria are
being issued internationally recognized Moldovan neutraldesign licence plates by two new offices in Transdniestria,
staffed jointly by officials from Moldova and Transdniestria.
With these licence plates and an “MD” sticker on the back,
vehicles from Transdniestria can drive on international
roads. By the end of the year, 1,759 neutral-design
licence plates had been issued, and online registration for
appointments at the Joint Vehicle Registration Offices is fully
booked until September 2019.

HIGHLIGHTS OF THE TRANSDNIESTRIAN
SETTELEMENT PROCESS
In 2018, the Sides implemented agreements related to:
 the use of vehicles from Transdniestria
on international roads;
 the functioning of Latin-script
schools in Transdniestria;
 the apostilization of Transdniestrian
university diplomas;
 access on the part of Moldovan farmers to their
farmlands on Transdniestrian-controlled territory;
 and the establishment of a legal framework for the
implementation of a telecommunications agreement.
The Sides also launched two working subgroups on banking and human rights.

Eight Latin-script schools in Transdniestria, with over
1,500 pupils, now operate with symbolic rent and utilities
costs, guaranteed freedom of movement for students and
teachers to and from the schools and unhindered delivery
of goods. Since April 2018, the new mechanism for the
apostilization of Transdniestrian university diplomas by
Moldova has enabled over 200 students from Transdniestria
to study abroad. As a result of the agreement between the
Sides to reinstate a mechanism that was in place between
2006 and 2014, Moldovan farmers regained unconditional
access to their lands in the Transdniestrian Dubasari district.
These developments were welcomed in the 25th OSCE
Ministerial Council statement adopted on 7 December
2018. The 57 OSCE participating States commended the
Sides for the major achievements on the four agreements

reached since 2017 and for the substantial progress made
in the implementation of a telecommunications agreement.
In addition to these successes, discussions in the
framework of the expert working groups moved beyond
the “package of eight” in 2018 to include areas such as
banking, phytosanitary certification, human rights and civilstatus documents. The Sides have also drafted agreements
on the return of children without parental care into the
extended family in difficult life situations and co-operation
in emergency situations. The Mission’s Human Rights
Programme provides key expertise to the Sides on the
issues discussed within the working groups.

CONFIDENCE-BUILDING MEASURES
The Mission continued supporting Moldova’s efforts to
fulfil its commitments to uphold human rights and promote
tolerance and inclusivity, which are important confidence
building measures for the settlement process.
The Mission’s Human Rights Program promoted
national minority issues, including measures to ensure
the affirmation of the autonomy of Gagauzia as a way
of promoting good governance throughout Moldova. In
2018, the Mission facilitated the signing of a memorandum
of understanding among the state actors involved in the
implementation of the National Strategy for Consolidation of
Interethnic Relations for 2017–2027, which was developed
with the joint support of the Mission and the OSCE
HCNM. Program activities supported the development
of an optional school course on the Holocaust in a local
context and efforts aimed at establishing the Jewish History
Museum in Chisinau. Both actions are foreseen in the
Moldovan Holocaust Action Plan.
To bring the Sides closer in efforts to resolve shared priority
issues, the Program organized no fewer than 75 capacitybuilding initiatives on human rights, including on gender
equality and human trafficking on both banks of the Dniestr/
Nistru River.

Between 2016 and 2018, the chief negotiators from Chisinau and Tiraspol signed
agreements from the “package of eight” on issues identified as priorities by the
Sides and led the process of implementing them. (OSCE/Iurie Foca)

The OSCE Special Monitoring Mission (SMM) to Ukraine was deployed in March 2014 and
is currently the OSCE’s largest field operations. The Mission establishes facts and gathers
information and reports on the security situation across Ukraine, monitors and supports
respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, and facilitates dialogue. With over 1,300
staff members throughout the country, the SMM aims to contribute to reducing tensions and
fostering peace, stability and security throughout Ukraine.

MONITORING, VERIFICATION AND
FACILITATION
In eastern Ukraine, the Mission monitored the adherence
to the ceasefire. In 2018, the SMM observed a 22 per cent
decrease in ceasefire violations in comparison with the
previous year. However a sustained and comprehensive

mine action activities, continued to form an important part
of the SMM’s activities.
The SMM continued to monitor the disengagement areas
and monitor and verify the withdrawal of heavy weapons. In
the disengagement areas near Stanytsia Luhanska, Zolote
and Petrivske, the Mission observed an increase in the

areas and critical civilian infrastructure sites.

on SMM facilitation and monitoring of infrastructure repair in
eastern Ukraine for the period from January 2017 to August
2018.

The Mission’s efforts to monitor continued to be hindered
as it faced repeated restrictions to its freedom of movement
and other impediments to the implementation of its
mandate, predominantly in non-government-controlled
areas, including areas of southern Donetsk region and near
the border with the Russian Federation. The use of remote
observation means, such as cameras and unmanned aerial
vehicles (UAV), including long-range UAVs, as a supplement
to the physical presence of SMM patrols, has allowed the
Mission to partially mitigate this and other impediments
to monitoring. An SMM long-range UAV crashed in late
October, most likely due to an impact, as it was observing
a convoy of trucks near the border with the Russian
Federation.
The SMM continued monitoring on land any possible effects
on the socio-economic situation and potential security
implications in relation to reported developments at the Sea
of Azov. Following the November incidents at sea involving
detention of vessels and sailors, the Chief Monitor called for
restraint by the parties involved.
Non-compliance with commitments to fully cease fire,
withdraw weapons and complete demining activities
has resulted in civilians losing their lives and being
injured, and facing hardship. While the number of civilian
casualties decreased compared with last year, the Mission
nonetheless corroborated 236 casualties in 2018 (43
fatalities and 193 injured). Eighty-six civilian causalities were
a result of mines, unexploded ordnance (UXO) and other
explosive devices in 2018 (23 fatalities and 63 injuries).
During the past year, the Mission deployed over 3,200
patrols on more than 1,200 occasions to monitor SMMfacilitated localized adherence to the ceasefire (so-called
windows of silence) which enabled about 100 infrastructure
repair projects to be carried out and the provision of
electricity, water, gas and mobile communications to
thousands of civilians on both sides of the contact line. One
of those repair works, on the South Donbas water pipeline,
ensured access to clean drinking water for 1.2 million
people. In December, the Mission issued a thematic report

In line with its mandate, the Mission continued to monitor
throughout Ukraine, including developments concerning
the Roma community and monitored public gatherings in
Kyiv, Lviv, Odessa and other cities. Following reports of
an incident at the Hungarian Cultural Centre in Uzhhorod,
in February 2018, the SMM intensified its patrolling in the
area through overlapping patrols by the Ivano-Frankivsk
monitoring team.
Relevant facts established by the monitoring officers
throughout Ukraine were included in 381 public reports
produced by the SMM in 2018.

“As a parent, you always worry about your children, no matter where you live, no matter how old they are. Now imagine raising
two boys, aged 7 and 11, in a conflict area … There are so many dangers out there. I’m aware of them but don’t really know
how to explain them to my children. Things like mines and UXO are not uncommon around here, but you need an expert to
find the right words to explain to children why a piece of metal they find in a forest can kill them. Last week, the OSCE sent
such experts to my sons’ school, and this might have been the most important and necessary lesson they had this year.”

to strengthen the ceasefire and initiatives related to mine
action, disengagement of forces and hardware, and the
withdrawal of heavy weapons from areas specified in the
Minsk agreements were discussed on a regular basis.
The Chief Monitor made repeated public statements calling
for full adherence to the ceasefire. In his address to the
United Nations Security Council in May, the Chief Monitor
highlighted the concerns of, and humanitarian challenges
facing, civilians living near the contact line.
PUBLIC OUTREACH
In 2018, the Mission’s public outreach focused primarily
on generating awareness of the Mission’s activities and
encouraging and facilitating public engagement in, and
support for, inclusive conflict resolution. This included over
100 outreach events, including mine awareness, press
statements, opinion pieces, videos, slide shows, articles
and an active social media presence. As public awareness
of the Mission’s activities increases, misconceptions about
the nature of the Mission are dispelled, trust is enhanced,

and OSCE core values are promoted. The Mission, through
its support for public campaigns such as “Letters of Peace”,
“Facts Matter” and “16 Days of Activism against GenderBased Violence”, also supported dialogue between civilians
on both sides of the contact line and encouraged civic
engagement in contributing to conflict resolution.
GENDER MAINSTREAMING
Consistent with the Mission’s commitment to gender
equality, the SMM adopted a gender-equality action plan
in 2018 that promotes a positive working environment. A
significant increase in the hiring of female monitoring officers
and senior managers already materialized during this time
frame. With greater internal diversity, the Mission is better
equipped to monitor and report on the diverse communities
in which it operates. This has improved the SMM’s ability to
highlight under-reported voices and build bridges between
communities across the contact line. The Mission’s thematic
report on gender dimensions of monitoring highlighted
achievements and the potential for further activities in this
regard.

“LETTERS OF PEACE”
In the framework of “Letters of Peace” – the Mission’s new outreach initiative – SMM monitoring
officers delivered hundreds of letters from and to civilians across the contact line to foster dialogue and
understanding. People throughout Ukraine warmly received the letters, conveying season’s greetings
and words of support, from complete strangers who live on the other side of the contact line.

Project
Co-ordinator
in Ukraine

Project Co-ordinator: Ambassador Vaidotas Verba (until 30 September 2018) and
Ambassador Ambassador Henrik Villadsen (from November 2018)
Budget: €3,598,800 (Unified budget), €2,193,495 (Extrabudgetary expenditure)
Staff: 3 international, 84 local (including 37 under extrabudgetary projects)
www.osce.org/project-coordinator-in-ukraine

To better implement its mandate in helping Ukraine meet its OSCE commitments, the
Project Co-ordinator in Ukraine (PCU) developed a three-year strategic plan with specific
targets set across the three OSCE dimensions. The goals are matched by planned and
pursued efforts to help the country address crisis-related challenges and implement
reforms by facilitating dialogue among key stakeholders.

SYSTEMATIC APPROACH TO EXPLOSIVE
AND ENVIRONMENTAL RISKS IN CONFLICTAFFECTED AREAS
Ukraine’s Mine Action Law was adopted by the Parliament
in December, establishing a framework for humanitarian
demining and distributing responsibilities among state
institutions, including the establishment of a mine-action
centre. In addition, National Mine Action Standards were
finalized in 2018 and are expected to be issued in 2019.
Ukraine’s standards are based on International Mine Action
Standards and adapted for conditions in the country.
They establish requirements for all aspects of mine action,
including information management, equipment, personnel,
survey and clearance, quality control and risk education.
The Project Co-ordinator provided international expertise
and facilitated dialogues among agencies and with mineaffected communities that ensured all voices were heard.
Following an assessment of conflict-related environmental
risks in eastern Ukraine conducted in 2017 and presented in
2018, the Co-ordinator focused his efforts on establishing a
system of monitoring that would enable the government and
citizens to better understand risks. To help track the quality
of surface and ground water in the Siverskyi Donets basin, a

major source of drinking water for several million people, the
Co-ordinator conducted a comprehensive chemical analysis
of samples drawn from throughout the basin. The analysis,
the most comprehensive in the country’s history, will serve
as a baseline for continuous water quality monitoring. The
Co-ordinator also provided laboratory equipment to the
Siverskyi Donets Basin Administration of Water Resources,
developed software for information exchange with the
Ministry of Economy and Natural Resources and trained
personnel to use the monitoring system.
ADDRESSING GENDER-BASED VIOLENCE
With new legislation passed in early 2018 and all types of
domestic violence criminalized as of January 2019, the Coordinator assisted authorities in preparing an enhanced
law enforcement response in this sphere. Three internal
instructions were prepared and adopted by the authorities
to protect survivors, including an emergency restrictive
order used by the police to limit suspects’ communication
with victims. The Co-ordinator trained 300 operators
and police dispatchers from the 102 emergency hotline
to better handle domestic-violence calls. To support
the Ministry of Interior’s introduction of multidisciplinary
response teams, called POLINA, the Co-ordinator trained
the first 150 members of such units in eight regions and
will continue to support this initiative in 2019. An interactive
training room was equipped for the Patrol Police Academy
in Kyiv, and a domestic-violence course was handed over
to be a part of the Academy’s curriculum for teaching new
recruits. Separately, 180 social workers and psychologists
in seven regions received training on the implementation of
corrective programmes for perpetrators of violence.
As crisis situations exacerbate the risk of gender-based
violence, the Co-ordinator worked to improve awareness
among key stakeholders. It produced two manuals titled
Women. Peace. Security for use in the professional
retraining of social-service providers and security sector
professionals. The Co-ordinator also conducted seminars
for 125 psychologists on psychological assistance to
conflict-affected people.

for women in law enforcement. The Co-ordinator and the
Ministry of Defence agreed that, together with the rights of
military personnel and interaction with civil society, gender
equality would be one of three components of a roadmap
for the Ministry to strengthen democratic control of the
armed forces. In addition, 150 senior and mid-ranking
officers were introduced to principles of gender equality
at six workshops and roundtables. Also, in co-operation
with the Supreme Court of Ukraine, the Co-ordinator
helped launch gender focal points in courts, where they
are expected to act as change agents for fostering gendersensitive practices in the judiciary. Eighteen judges were
trained to fulfil that role.
PROMOTING E-SOLUTIONS FOR BETTER
GOVERNANCE
Ukraine has been demonstrating a high rate of
e-governance implementation, as demonstrated by the
United Nations E-Government Survey. As the institutional
capacity to continue with digitalization policies is in place,
the Co-ordinator has started phasing out its multi-year
efforts in assisting the country in digitalizing administrative
services for the prevention of corruption and for providing
better service to the people. In 2018, the Co-ordinator
identified key macroeconomic factors that will impact the
further development of the digital economy, and relevant
recommendations were handed over to the government.
E-solutions introduced with the Co-ordinator’s support
at the national level in the spheres of construction, land
management and industrial-waste permits are continuously
being modernized by the government and are increasingly
being used by Ukrainians.

In 2018, the Observer Mission continued to ensure an uninterrupted presence at the two
Russian checkpoints Gukovo and Donetsk, operating under the principles of impartiality
and transparency. Through its regular reports, the Mission continued to contribute to the
OSCE’s efforts in dealing with the crisis in and around Ukraine, providing the Chairmanship
and the participating States with unique and reliable information on the situation at these
two checkpoints, as well as on movement across the border at two checkpoints. These
reports are available online in English and Russian. The Mission also issued 12 spot reports
concerning Russian convoys bound for Ukraine. The OSCE Permanent Council extended
the mandate of the Observer Mission until 31 May 2019. As of 2018, following a decision of
the Permanent Council, the usual duration of the mandate of the Mission was extended to
four months instead of three.
CONTACTS WITH RUSSIAN AUTHORITIES AND
THE MEDIA
The Observer Mission continued to strengthen its
working relationship with the authorities present at both
border checkpoints, as well as with the Rostov Regional
Administration and the Rostov representative office of the
Foreign Ministry of the Russian Federation, and with local
authorities in Kamensk-Shakhtinskiy, including the mayor
and representatives of the security and safety services.
On 16 May, a delegation from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
of the Russian Federation, accompanied by representatives
of the regional authorities, visited the OSCE observers
at both checkpoints and the main office in KamenskShakhtinskiy. The Chief Observer visited the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation three times during
the reporting period to discuss mission-related issues at
governmental level.

Jointly with the Transnational Threats Department,
the Centre initiated seminars on countering the use of
the Internet for terrorist purposes and on CVERLT for
representatives of law enforcement bodies, the Office
of the Ombudsperson, civil society and the media. They
also organized a national exercise on protecting critical
energy infrastructure from cyber-related terrorist attacks
for representatives from the energy sector and government
institutions.
To prevent the movement of foreign terrorist fighters, the
Centre partnered with IOM and organized a workshop
on how to set up an API system for representatives
from all agencies involved in passenger processing in
Turkmenistan. The OSCE Mobile Training Team delivered
an interactive course on identifying foreign terrorist fighters
for officers from Turkmenistan’s border and migration
services.

frameworks to facilitate cross-border trade and the
development of small and medium-sized enterprises.

INTER-CONFESSIONAL DIALOGUE
As a secular state, Kyrgyzstan advances democratic
principles in the sphere of religion or belief. The Office
continued promoting international and national interconfessional dialogue by assisting the State Commission
on Religious Affairs in hosting platforms that bring together
religious leaders from every province in the country, as well
as supporting the organization of two high-level international
conferences on the topic of Islam in a Modern Secular State
with the aim of maintaining the established dialogue and

Throughout 2018, the OSCE Programme Office in Dushanbe strengthened its engagement
with the host country to support the implementation of OSCE commitments in all three
dimensions of security. Border security, expanding economic opportunities, youth and
women’s political participation were at the core of the Office’s work, through interventions
such as the Network by Consensus youth initiative, the Model OSCE, a network of young
Tajik gender champions and entrepreneurial Start-up Weekends. In the area of border
security, the BMSC entered a new phase characterized by a more strategic focus on core
offerings and continued attention paid to partnerships in Central Asia, Afghanistan and
beyond.

BORDER MANAGEMENT STAFF COLLEGE
A new era for the BMSC was launched in 2018 with its fouryear plan of activities. The College reinforced its training
output by offering high-quality courses targeting border
management and security officials from OSCE participating
States and Partners for Co-operation, with particular
attention paid to involving officials from Afghanistan. In
January, its “Border Security and Management for Senior
Leaders” course was granted postgraduate diploma
accreditation by Estonia’s Quality Agency for Higher and
Vocational Education, underlining the BMSC’s intention
to become a recognized specialist in border security and
management training in the OSCE area. In October, the
College conducted its first staff course outside Tajikistan,
in Italy, with the support of the Guardia di Finanza and the
OSCE Secretariat’s Border Security and Management
Unit. 2018 also marked a milestone in the BMSC’s efforts
to promote female leadership in border management and
security, with a record high of 58 per cent of female staff
course participants.
MEN ENGAGE NETWORK FOR GENDER
EQUALITY
Men’s roles in championing gender equality were at the
forefront of the Office’s efforts to empower women in social
and political life in 2018. Prominent male politicians, police
officers, rural youth and civil society representatives actively
shaped a series of high-profile events aimed at preventing
domestic violence and challenging gender stereotypes.
Making use of the political momentum to support women’s
empowerment, male politicians, including members of
parliament, set out to promote women in the political
sphere within their parties and in society by implementing
political parties’ gender action plans, appointing gender
focal points, lobbying for women’s quotas in parliament
and mentoring young Tajik men to become gender
champions. At the grass-roots level, the Office nurtured a
network of 45 young gender champions (30 women, 15
men) that was established in 2017. The gender champions,
many from remote areas, were empowered by new skills
they learned in two summer camps aimed at tackling

and drawings. Many went on to enact changes in societal
behaviour by organizing debate clubs, training and raising
awareness in their own families, communities, and in their
workplaces, often through a peer-to-peer approach.
PROMOTING ENTREPRENEURSHIP
Start-up Weekends were introduced in Tajikistan in 2015
as a way to develop entrepreneurship in a country heavily
reliant on remittances. These unique public-private initiatives
help business owners build skills to present ideas, create
business plans and pitch their products and services. In
2018, the Office sponsored two Start-up Weekends in

In provincial areas, OSCE-supported Business Resource
Centres helped open or expand 15 businesses and aided
more than 1,000 existing and potential business owners
with advice on taxation, licences, regulations and access
to finance. Mobile consultations in major district towns
enabled the Centres to conduct more outreach than ever
before. The investment climate for larger companies was
also a key priority. The Office has been a strong supporter
of the country’s four free economic zones and promoted
their development by evaluating their operations, exposing
their management to best practices in other OSCE
participating States and making the marketing of their
services more effective.
YOUTH ENGAGEMENT
The Network by Consensus is an initiative uniting over 400
alumni of the Office’s youth events from all over Tajikistan.
It creates a platform for young people to share, inspire
and motivate their peers. In 2018, the Office assisted
young people through the Network to play an active and
constructive role in civic life. An enhanced regional lens was
applied to youth activities, with a special focus on engaging
active young people from Afghanistan, thus promoting
confidence building and collaboration between the youth

of Tajikistan and Central Asian states. Workshops on public
speaking, debating, negotiating and networking skills were
designed to empower them to reach their aspirations in
public life, business and civil society. Feeding into this
expanding pool of engaged young people, the Office
organized Model OSCE events for university students from
across the country. In addition to raising awareness about
the OSCE, the Model OSCE imbued the skills needed
for active social and civic participation through lectures,
workshops, interactive exercises and Permanent Council
simulation sessions. Members of the Network met with the
OSCE Secretary General during his visit to Tajikistan in May
to discuss the challenges facing youth and ways the OSCE
can support youth empowerment.

CYBER/ICT SECURITY
The PCUz facilitated the implementation of the OSCE’s
confidence building measures to reduce the risk of conflicts
stemming from the use of information and communications
technologies by raising awareness among key national
stakeholders and government agencies. Uzbekistan
established a contact point to manage ICT-related threats
and developed a road map to further improve cyber/ICT
security.

IMPROVING LABOUR MIGRATION POLICIES
Jointly with state agencies and NGOs, the PCUz supported
a country-wide gender-disaggregated survey on the
situation of labour migration and emerging trends. The
survey will provide a basis for recommendations for state
measures to address the challenges facing migrants and
their families. The PCUz also supported the establishment
of a consultancy centre for labour migrants in Tashkent.

COMBATING CORRUPTION
The PCUz supported capacity-building for government
and business representatives on combating and
preventing corruption. In addition, a country-wide public
awareness campaign promoting a zero-tolerance policy to
corruption was organized in co-operation with national and
international partners.
SUPPORTING OPEN GOVERNANCE
An open data project, implemented in co-operation with the
Ministry for Development of Information Technologies and
Communications, provided expertise for the development
of a national open data strategy and strengthened the
capacities of national stakeholders through the exchange
of best practices. Over 500 young people participated in a
collaborative open data challenge aimed at engaging young
people in the development of ICT solutions.

DEVELOPING A NATIONAL INSTITUTIONAL
FRAMEWORK AND MULTIDIMENSIONAL
RESPONSE TO COMBATING TRAFFICKING IN
HUMAN BEINGS
In 2018, the PCUz launched a new series of anti-trafficking
training courses for 50 police officers from seven regions of
Uzbekistan. The courses were aimed at developing police
attitudes and skills to help them identify victims of human
trafficking and to refer them to the appropriate services for
assistance. Particular attention was paid to new forms and
methods of recruitment of potential victims through digital
technologies. In addition, the training explored the nexus
between human trafficking and terrorism.

SUPPORTING UZBEKISTAN IN ITS APPROACH
TO COMBATING TORTURE
Throughout 2018, the PCUz, in co-operation with ODIHR,
the National Human Rights Centre, Uzbekistan’s human
rights Ombudsman, the UN Subcommittee on Prevention
of Torture and the Human Rights Implementation Centre at
the University of Bristol, prepared and conducted a series
of capacity-building workshops to inform the ongoing
national debate on ratification of the Optional Protocol to
the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman
or Degrading Treatment or Punishment and the potential
establishment of a national preventive mechanism in
Uzbekistan.

ENHANCING THE PROFESSIONAL SKILLS OF
INVESTIGATIVE DIVISIONS OF THE INTERIOR
MINISTRY
In 2018, the PCUz conducted training on investigative
interviewing for 50 law enforcement officials. Emphasis was
placed on human-rights-compliant policing, including the
presumption of innocence, the prohibition of torture and
treating witnesses and suspects with dignity and respect at
all stages of the investigative process.

PROMOTING JUDICIAL AND LEGAL REFORMS
In support of the 2017-2021 Action Strategy for the Further
Development of Uzbekistan, the PCUz was engaged
in promoting judicial and legal reforms by organizing
conferences and round-table discussions on the review
of institutional, criminal and criminal procedural legislation,

LEVERAGING
PARTNERSHIPS
Security in the OSCE area is inseparably linked to that of
neighbouring regions and can be strengthened through
dialogue and the sharing of norms, commitments and
expertise. This is why the OSCE maintains privileged

Throughout the year, the OSCE continued to engage
in political dialogue and to share experience with its five
Asian and six Mediterranean Partners for Co-operation.

ASIAN PARTNERS FOR CO-OPERATION

The OSCE participating States and the Asian Partners
continued to investigate ways to further strengthen their cooperation by cultivating an open and interactive dialogue
both within the established meeting formats and beyond.
The rolling schedule of the Asian Contact Group featured
several innovative topics, such as cyber-diplomacy and
economic connectivity, with a particular focus on financial
technology innovations, exposure to cyber/ICT security
risks and opportunities to support the UN’s SDGs. With
events on the Korean Peninsula developing rapidly, special
attention was paid to the potential of using confidence
building mechanisms to strengthen Inter-Korean relations as
a basis for a future permanent peace. The Asian Partners
continued to contribute to the OSCE’s dialogue and to
provide significant financial and human resources in support
of OSCE activities.
Throughout the year, the Secretary General and his
team participated in high-level events organized by Asian
Partners and held numerous high-level meetings with senior
government representatives from all five Asian Partners, as
well as various informal consultations aimed at exchanging
best practices in the area of promoting comprehensive

security across all three dimensions. A highlight of the year
was the Secretary General’s meeting with Japanese Foreign
Minister Taro Kono, who reiterated his country’s strong
interest in, and support for, the OSCE. At the high-level
conference Effective Multilateralism in a Globalized World –
The Case of Europe and Asia Pacific, organized by the 2018
Austrian Chair of the Asian Contact Group, the Secretary
General said that he saw potential for further enhancing
opportunities for engaging the Asian Partners in OSCE
internal discussions and activities and for creating additional
space within the OSCE for including Asian security concerns
in the Organization’s overall agenda for security dialogue.
The OSCE Asian Conference in Canberra focused on
common challenges and opportunities in the regions of the
Asian Partners and the OSCE. The Director of the Office of
the Secretary General emphasized the need to strengthen
comprehensive security through dialogue. The OSCE
Secretariat further supported South Korea in organizing
another Inter-regional Conference, which in 2018 focused
on preventing and countering violent extremism and
radicalization that lead to terrorism.

MEDITERRANEAN PARTNERS
FOR CO-OPERATION

2018 was an important year for the OSCE’s Mediterranean
partnership, which saw a strong push by the Italian OSCE
Chairmanship and the Slovakian Chairmanship of the
Mediterranean Contact Group for a more substantive and
action-oriented partnership.
The Secretary General supported these efforts by
calling for a more strategic approach to the partnership
through better-defined priorities for dialogue, enhanced
practical co-operation with the Partners, a long-term view
of the partnership’s desired outcomes and revamped
partnership tools, starting with renewed investment in the
extrabudgetary Partnership Fund established in 2007.
An ambassadorial retreat in Trieste, Italy, on 7-9 June
registered widespread interest among all stakeholders for
a revival of the partnership. On that occasion, the Italian
Chairmanship endorsed a more strategic approach and
proposed some practical next steps. Meanwhile, the
Slovak Chairmanship of the Contact Group completed a

successful programme in 2018, with an emphasis on a
positive agenda for Mediterranean co-operation.
Topics dealt with by the Contact Group ranged from
issues such as water management and energy security to
education, cyber/ICT security and security sector reform.
The Mediterranean Conference in Málaga, Spain, on 2526 October, co-organized by Slovakia and Spain, focused
on the topic of energy co-operation. For the fourth year in
a row, the Mediterranean Conference attracted ministeriallevel participation, confirming that the Mediterranean
partnership has reached a higher political profile.
On the project side, numerous initiatives were carried out
with the active participation of the Mediterranean Partners,
including in the areas of countering trafficking in cultural
property, promoting co-operative and effective border
management, combating trafficking in human beings along
migration routes and empowering youth.

PROMOTING YOUNG SOCIAL AND GREEN ENTREPRENEURS IN THE MEDITERRANEAN
The Italian OSCE Chairmanship launched the OSCE GEMS award, which rewards social and green
entrepreneurs under 35 years of age from Mediterranean countries. The six winners of the first-ever
GEMS award, young entrepreneurs from Algeria, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Morocco and Tunisia, invented
new products and processes that help improve the environment while at the same time making a social
impact. Their projects range from turning discarded dates into high-quality food and upcycling plastic
waste, to greening roofs and using sunlight to supply electricity and warm water to neighbourhoods.

The GEMS award is implemented in partnership with the Switchers Fund, a grant-making entity that
supports innovative green businesses in the Mediterranean, and its promoters. The first edition of the
award was funded by the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Co-operation.

Co-operation with international and regional
organizations
Dialogue and practical co-operation with other international and regional organizations and
institutions remained an important aspect of the OSCE’s work in 2018. At the Secretariat
level, the Organization held regular bilateral and multilateral consultations with partner
organizations. At the operational level, the OSCE joined forces with international partners in
order to draw on the strengths and comparative advantages of each organization.

Political dialogue
UNITED NATIONS (UN)
In 2018, the enduring partnership between
the UN and the OSCE advanced in a number
of strategic areas that are critically important for peace
and security in the OSCE region.
OSCE Secretary General Greminger represented the
OSCE at several high-level UN events, including a meeting
of the General Assembly on peacebuilding and sustaining
peace, the UN Secretary-General’s interactive dialogue
with heads of regional and other organizations, and the
73rd general debate of the General Assembly (UNGA).
On each occasion, the Secretary General brought the
OSCE’s perspective into UN discussions on peace and
security and emphasized the support of the OSCE for the
implementation of the UN Secretary-General’s sustaining
peace agenda.
2018 also saw the conclusion of MoUs between the
OSCE, as represented by the Secretary General, and
the UNDP, UN Women and the UNOTC, respectively.
These agreements will strengthen the ability of the OSCE
Secretariat to implement its mandate to support the
participating States in co-operation with partners from the
UN family of organizations.

COUNCIL OF EUROPE (COE)
Co-operation between the OSCE and the CoE
continued to develop in the four agreed areas
of co-operation: the fight against terrorism, combating human
trafficking, protection of the rights of persons belonging to
national minorities and promotion of tolerance and nondiscrimination. The two annual meetings of the CoE-OSCE
Co-ordination Group held in 2018 proved to be an effective
format for sharing views on issues of mutual interest.
Regular communication between experts and co-ordination
of activities, including in the field, continued to be the
foundation underpinning OSCE-CoE interaction. Political
contacts also intensified thanks to the well-established
practice of briefings by respective Chairmanships and the
meeting between the Secretaries General on the margins of
the UNGA in New York.
EUROPEAN UNION (EU)
The OSCE-EU relationship took a major step
forward in 2018 with an exchange of letters,
which established a framework for co-operation between
the two organizations, providing, inter alia, for an annual
high-level meeting between OSCE executive structures and
EU institutions. At the first meeting, held on 12 December
2018, representatives of both organizations discussed how

OSCE Secretary General Thomas Greminger and the High Representative of
the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy/Vice-President of
the European Commission, Federica Mogherini, exchange letters to further
strengthen EU-OSCE co-operation, Brussels, 22 June 2018. (EEAS)

Operational Co-operation
OSCE executive structures co-operate with a broad array of specialized organizations to ensure that their complementary
mandates and expertise provide coherent and integrated responses to security challenges in the OSCE area. The following
section presents a few examples of the numerous practical activities jointly undertaken by the OSCE and its peers.

CONFLICT PREVENTION AND RESOLUTION
The OSCE Conflict Prevention Centre (CPC) continued
its long-standing close working relations with the EU and
UN in the context of the Geneva International Discussions
addressing the consequences of the August 2008 war in
Georgia, co-chaired by the three organizations.
The CPC also further developed operational partnerships
with relevant departments at UN headquarters to explore
synergies that enable cost-effective and rapid access to
resources for crisis prevention and response. In the area
of mediation, staff from the UN Mediation Support Unit
visited the CPC’s Mediation Support Team to exchange
experiences and review successful practices.
The CPC continued its close co-operation with UNHCR
on the Joint Protection Checklist addressing Displacement
and Protection of Displaced Populations and Affected
Communities along the Conflict Cycle. Three worskhops on
how to address displacement in a collaborative approach
were held for the OSCE Mission in Kosovo, the OSCE
Programme Office in Tajikistan and the OSCE Mission to
Skopje respectively.
To better highlight the crucial role that regional
organizations play in preventive diplomacy, the OSCE’s
High Commissioner on National Minorities and the Italian
Permanent Representation to the United Nations convened
a meeting of regional organizations in New York. The
meeting included representatives from the Shanghai
Cooperation Organisation, the League of Arab States, the
EU, the Organization of American States and the UN.

OSCE’s Transnational Threats Department are implemented
in partnership with other organizations, including the
UNODC, the Global Counterterrorism Forum, the
European Border and Coast Guard Agency (Frontex),
Europol, INTERPOL, the European Union Agency for Law
STRENGTHENING PARTNERSHIPS AGAINST
TERRORISM AND VIOLENT EXTREMISM
The OSCE, the UN and the EU jointly supported a highlevel conference on countering terrorism and preventing
violent extremism organized by the Government of the
Republic of Tajikistan. The strategic importance of the
conference, which was held in Dushanbe on 3 and 4
May, was driven by the need to establish a common
understanding of current challenges and obstacles and
to strengthen regional and inter-regional partnerships.

MONDEM – A JOINT DEMILITARIZATION
SUCCESS STORY
The Montenegro Demilitarization Programme
(MONDEM), a partnership initiative of the Government of
Montenegro, the OSCE and the UNDP, was successfully
concluded in 2018. From 2007 through to 2018, this
programme saw the destruction of 60 battle tanks
and 965 heavy artillery pieces to be sold as scrap
metal, provided for the safe disposal of 128 tons of
melange oxidizer and rocket fuel and infrastructure
upgrades for two ammunition depots, as well as the
safe destruction of 1,806 tons of surplus ammunition.

Enforcement Training (CEPOL), the CSTO and the CoE.
In 2018, the Department concluded technical MoUs with
the WCO, the UNOCT and the Italian Finance Police. In

In 2018, the Office of the Special Representative and Coordinator for Combating Trafficking in Human Beings
(OSR/CTHB) became a full-fledged member of the UN
Inter-Agency Co-ordination Group Against Trafficking
in Persons. Co-operation between the OSR/CTHB and
the CoE remained strong, as the two organizations cohosted a meeting of national anti-trafficking co-ordinators
and rapporteurs, continued to exchange work plans and
co-ordinated their respective country visits. The OSR/
CTB hosted the 18th Alliance against Trafficking in Human
Beings in 2018, which remains a key platform for states and
international organizations to organize joint activities and
share information on trends and challenges in the area of
counter-trafficking.
