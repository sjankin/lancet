 THE YEAR IN FOCUS


About the EBRD
Across three continents – from central Europe to the Western Balkans,
the southern and eastern Mediterranean and Central Asia – the EBRD
invests in changing people’s lives. We finance projects that strengthen
the private sector in economies undergoing transition to a well-
functioning market system. Our investment decisions are guided by six
‘transition qualities’, which focus on making economies competitive,
well governed, green, inclusive, resilient and integrated. We operate
in places on the path to becoming stronger and more sustainable,
democratic, open-market economies.

Working from its London headquarters and network of 37 Resident Offices, the Bank
invests in commercial projects that deliver a market-based financial return while having
a measurable economic, social or environmental impact. We work with private clients of
all sizes, including small businesses, which constitute the backbone of many economies
in the EBRD regions. We also finance municipal entities and publicly owned companies,
often in support of essential infrastructure and services for people. The Bank invests
in well-structured, financially robust projects, both directly and through financial
intermediaries such as local banks and investment funds. Our principal financing
instruments are loans, equity investments and guarantees.

The EBRD supports the transition process by combining investment with close policy
dialogue with local and central governments, regulators, financial institutions, and
representatives of civil society, as well as by providing technical assistance and advisory
services using funds donated by governments and institutions. Donor funds play a vital
role in ensuring the success of these activities and act as a catalyst or enabler for our
investment. Moreover, donors finance seven multilateral funds, managed by the EBRD,
to increase nuclear safety in the economies where we invest.

 OUR TRANSITION QUALITIES


The EBRD exists to promote the transition to a market economy through investment, technical
assistance initiatives and policy dialogue. We believe that a sustainable, well-functioning
market economy must be competitive, well governed, green, inclusive, resilient and integrated.
All Bank projects seek to foster one or more of these six transition qualities.




Competitive
Helping economies to be more competitive lies
at the heart of the EBRD mission. Bank projects
promote market structures that support innovation,
ensure competition between firms, build the
capacity of companies to generate value and
foster a business environment that incentivises
commercially sound decision-making.
