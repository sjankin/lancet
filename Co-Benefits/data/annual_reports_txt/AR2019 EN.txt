                                President’s foreword
                                Since the start of 2020, much of the world’s attention
                                has been focused on the COVID-19 pandemic.
                                At this challenging time, we are reminded of the
                                importance of international cooperation and of the
                                need for a strong global, multilateral system.

                                Many of our global problems – including disease,
                                hunger, inequality, conflict and fragility – can only
                                be solved by countries acting together.

                                We also have been made keenly aware that in a crisis, it is the poor and
                                vulnerable who suffer most. When economies go into recession, those
                                working in precarious jobs in informal employment – often women and
                                young people – and the operators of small and medium-sized enterprises
                                tend to be hit hardest. And people living in countries that lack the
                                resources to deal with crises are even more vulnerable. With this in
                                mind, it is crucial that, in tandem with providing necessary emergency

                                able to protect those most at risk of being left behind.

d   In addition to its pledge to the Eighth Replenishment of EUR 6 million, Ireland made a further contribution of EUR 891,000.
e   Payments include cash and promissory notes. Amounts are expressed in thousands of United States dollars. Thus payments
    received for less than US$500 are not shown in appendix H. Consequently, the contribution from Zambia (US$148) does not appear
    above.
f   The country name changed to Eswatini effective 19 April 2018.
