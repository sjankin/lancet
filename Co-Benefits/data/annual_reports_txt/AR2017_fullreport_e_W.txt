    President’s foreword
                      In 2017, IFAD introduced major reforms to
                      increase its impact on rural hunger and poverty
                      and maximize its role in the achievement of the
                      Sustainable Development Goals. We established
                      a new business model and financial strategy to
                      ensure that the organization is fit for purpose
                      and can contribute fully to the 2030 Agenda for
                      Sustainable Development, in particular to the
                      commitment to leave no one behind.
                        IFAD invests 100 per cent of its portfolio
                      in rural areas of developing countries, where
                      80 per cent of the world’s poorest people live and
                      work. This has been our mandate for 40 years,
                      and we must never stop asking how we can deliver
                      more, and deliver better, for the people we serve.
                        Over the course of the Consultation on the
                      Eleventh Replenishment of IFAD’s Resources
                      (IFAD11), with the agreement of our Member
                      States, we renewed our approaches in the
                      following areas:
                        • h
                           ow we raise and leverage resources to fund
                           the projects we support
                        • h
                           ow we allocate those resources to the
                           countries that need them most and that will
                           make the best use of them
                        • h
                           ow we deliver excellence, results and impact
                           on the ground
                        • h
                           ow we advocate, influence and work in
                           partnerships on behalf of rural poor people.


                      Our aim regarding mobilization of resources
                      is twofold. We will increase the resources we
                      mobilize through traditional approaches,
                      with Member State core contributions through
                      replenishments remaining the bedrock of IFAD’s
                      financing. But, at the same time, we are boosting
                      our capacity to leverage those resources, and to
                      assemble development finance from other sources,
                      including the private sector.

IFAD AND THE 2030 AGENDA FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
IFAD is fully committed to the ambitious 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and works
closely with governments to enable them to reach their national development goals. We play a vital
role in the achievement of SDG1 through our focus on investment in rural areas, where 80 per cent
of the poorest people live. SDG2 is also essential to our mandate and we are mainstreaming
nutrition across our portfolio.
IFAD is a leader in the economic and social empowerment of rural women and recognizes that
gender equality is fundamental to the entire 2030 Agenda. We also enable smallholder farmers,
who are on the front line of climate change, to become more resilient, for example through
the Adaptation for Smallholder Agriculture Programme. We support rural people in sustainably
managing resources, such as land, water and biodiversity.
To broaden and scale up the impact of our work, in line with SDG17 we work extensively in
partnership with other actors, including government, civil society and the private sector.




IFAD has invested in rural people for 40 years, empowering them to reduce poverty, increase food
security, improve nutrition and strengthen resilience. Since 1978, we have provided US$19.8 billion
in grants and low-interest loans to projects that have reached about 474 million people. IFAD is an
international financial institution and a specialized United Nations agency based in Rome – the UN’s food
and agriculture hub.

To seek higher diversification and returns, the Fund
may invest in securities denominated in currencies
other than those included in the SDR valuation basket,
and enter into forward foreign exchange agreements in
order to maintain the matching in currency terms, of
commitments denominated in SDRs and United States

(i) Liquidity risk
Prudent liquidity risk management includes maintaining
sufficient cash and cash equivalents to meet loan and
grant disbursements as well as other administrative
outflows as they arise.

IFAD’s liquidity risk is addressed through the minimum
liquidity requirement (MLR). IFAD’s liquidity policy,
together with the revised MLR for the Tenth
Replenishment of IFAD’s Resources (IFAD10) period
(2016-2018), states that highly liquid assets in IFAD’s
investment portfolio should remain above 60 per cent of
