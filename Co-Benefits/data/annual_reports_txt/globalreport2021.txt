GLOBAL
REPORT
2021

The High Commissioner for Refugees is mandated by the United Nations
to lead and coordinate international action for the worldwide protection of
refugees and the resolution of refugee problems. Its primary purpose is to
safeguard the rights and well-being of refugees. In its efforts to achieve
this objective, the Office strives to ensure that everyone can exercise the
right to seek asylum and find safe refuge in another State, and to return home voluntarily. By assisting
refugees to return to their own country or to settle permanently in another country, UNHCR also seeks
lasting solutions to their plight.
UNHCR’s Executive Committee and the UN General Assembly have authorized involvement with other
groups. These include former refugees who have returned to their homeland, internally displaced
people, and persons who are stateless or whose nationality is disputed. The Office seeks to reduce
situations of forced displacement by encouraging States and other institutions to create conditions
which are conducive to the protection of human rights and the peaceful resolution of disputes. In all of
its activities, it pays particular attention to the needs of children and seeks to promote the equal rights
of women and girls.
The Office carries out its work in collaboration with many partners, including governments, regional
organizations, and international and non-governmental organizations. It is committed to the principle of
participation, believing that refugees and others who benefit from the Office’s activities should be
consulted over decisions which affect their lives.

Republics of Iran and Pakistan, Jordan, Lebanon,
Sudan, Türkiye and Uganda were among the
leaders in welcoming refugees. It takes a wide
network of support to safeguard the life and
prospects of a person who is forced to flee. In
the past half-decade, there has been a restated
consensus that responsibilities and burdens must
be shared, expressed through the Global Compact
and at the Global Refugee Forum, and I hope
that the inspiring responses to many tragedies,
including the war in Ukraine, will help to spread
awareness and give further impetus to the global
momentum for action.

Amid new crises and growing
needs, we are determined

High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi meets Mileydis López and Emanuel Ruiz, asylum seekers in Colombia, who performed during ceremonies
marking World Refugee Day in Barranquilla. They began singing together after meeting at a UNHCR-administered transit centre.

Despite the widely-shared view that we are living in a
time of increasing division and discord, more and more
people are asking themselves the same question:
“What can I do to help?” The conflict in Ukraine
has awoken millions to their own ability to make a
difference, proving that there are great reserves of
generosity in our modern society. Ukraine is not the
first tragedy to have jolted the conscience of the
world: it follows the crisis in Afghanistan in 2021 and

many other displacement situations that have arisen
in past decades. Each is a reminder that people who
are forcibly displaced or stateless, from anywhere in
the world, are ordinary people. They did not want,
expect or ask to be displaced or stateless. They are not
a type of person. What they have in common – what
could happen to any of us – is their misfortune to find
themselves in this vulnerable situation and their need
for the generosity of others to survive, recover and

resume a normal, stable life, hopefully back at home.
UNHCR is determined to bring this about, not just for
Ukrainians but for all people of concern. But we cannot
do so alone.
This is why we are so grateful to all the States and
communities that host forcibly displaced people,
as well as to our donors. In 2021, States such
as Bangladesh, Colombia, Germany, the Islamic

Our supporters know that each well-publicized
crisis they see on their screens is merely the tip
of an iceberg of global need. Most crises flare
up unnoticed, and they can burn for decades
without drawing global attention. In 2021, UNHCR
responded to 40 new emergencies, in Afghanistan,
the Central African Republic, Chad, the Democratic
Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Mozambique,
Myanmar and elsewhere. The numbers of people
of concern to UNHCR continued their relentless
rise. Climate change triggered extreme weather
events and exacerbated shortages, adding to the
risk of displacement events occurring, and to the
risks encountered by those who were displaced.
There was also far too little progress on eliminating
statelessness, an avoidable predicament that
probably afflicts many millions. The available
statistics fail to tell the true story, highlighting
stateless populations in States such as Côte
d’Ivoire – which deserves praise for being the first,
and so far only, country in Africa to introduce a
procedure for determining statelessness.
We responded quickly and effectively, with
emergency deployments to fortify the protection
of people who had been forced to flee, registering
them, and providing cash, basic goods, shelter,
food and nutrition to meet the most immediate

OVERVIEW I FOREWORD BY HIGH COMMISSIONER FILIPPO GRANDI

life-saving needs. Flexible funding, given by some
governments and many private sector donors, is the
best way to support refugees in such situations. It
gives UNHCR invaluable leeway in how and where
to use the funds entrusted to it.
Being displaced should not mean putting your life
on hold, and we are increasingly emphasizing the
need to focus on development and not merely
aid. People must be able to continue with their
education and to offer their skills to employers and,
until they can return home with more experience
and skills to rebuild their country, should have a
chance to integrate into the local community or
resettle in a place that has the capacity to
host them.
And solutions – even temporary – must also be
sought, something UNHCR is prioritizing from
the outset of any emergency. 2021 saw several
historic milestones of solidarity, notably Colombia’s
decision to offer Temporary Protection Status
to 1.8 million Venezuelans and the strategic
consensus in West Africa on a comprehensive
solution for Ivorian refugees. Even during a second
pandemic-affected year, many of the pledges
made at the 2019 Global Refugee Forum moved
forward, a positive sign from such a wide array
of partners.
However, third country solutions remained
exceptionally rare. Resettlement numbers rose
only modestly in 2021 and the progress on
complementary pathways was slow. The world is
failing to live up to the vision set out in 2019, for
3 million refugees to benefit from third country
solutions by 2028. We know that there is far more
capacity to offer resettlement, and public support
for doing so – Ukraine’s crisis has demonstrated
as much, and Afghanistan’s crisis in 2021 stirred
support far beyond the neighbouring States. Third
country solutions will not be the answer for most

6 UNHCR GLOBAL REPORT 2021

OVERVIEW I FOREWORD BY HIGH COMMISSIONER FILIPPO GRANDI

forcibly displaced people. For them, the solution is
not an “if” but a “when”. Specifically, when will the
conflict end? In 2021, the calming of conflicts saw
hundreds of thousands return in Burundi, Libya,
Somalia and South Sudan. Even if the peace is less
than perfect, stopping wars is the best antidote to
displacement.
Despite the heightened needs, some States
engaged in refoulement and pushbacks on land
and at sea, a cruel denial of humanity, and there
was a worrying trend towards the externalization
of international obligations, as if asylum can be
traded for political gain. Many countries also
gave into vaccine nationalism, hoarding
COVID-19 vaccines in an own goal for global
public health.
However, I am heartened that most countries
answered the call to include refugees in their
national COVID-19 vaccination drives, and the
doors that shut so abruptly at the start of the
pandemic have mostly reopened, easing access
to territory and asylum. Those that have not fully
reopened paths to asylum must do so without
delay. Whoever, wherever, whenever: everyone
has the right to seek safety.
Having adapted to cope with the pandemic in
2020, UNHCR continued to innovate in 2021, while
also continuing to support national responses.
Our strategy of prioritizing cash assistance,
exploiting communications technology and
working through communities proved invaluable,
allowing support and information to flow more
efficiently to the people who needed it. But the
pandemic’s impact went far beyond the dangers
of the virus itself. It deepened the relative
disadvantage of forcibly displaced and stateless
people, increasing poverty, setting back education
and employment, and heightening risks for women
and children in particular.

To better meet the needs of forcibly displaced and
stateless people, UNHCR enhanced its ability to
gather and present evidence on their plight and
the potential solutions. In 2021, our growing data
capabilities included surveys and research conducted
by the UNHCR-World Bank Joint Data Center,
increasing use of participatory assessments and
post-distribution monitoring of cash assistance, a
proliferation of contacts and feedback via websites
and social media, and a boost in the number of people
registered in UNHCR’s PRIMES database. All this helps
in protection, assistance, empowerment and eventual
solutions. Forcibly displaced and stateless people are
the strongest advocates for their own needs, but they
often struggle to be heard. UNHCR is working with
them to meet their needs, as well as keeping them
informed about risks such as dangerous journeys
and opportunities such as COVID-19 vaccinations.
UNHCR’s work with communities has been
significantly enhanced by embracing technology, with
stronger communication and accountability thanks to
digital inclusion, call centres, high frequency phone
surveys and help websites. Technology is a powerful
multiplier across UNHCR. It has enabled us to make
a revolutionary switch to cash assistance and is now
driving a scale-up of education via Instant Network
Schools, and the replacement of diesel-powered water
pumping with solarized boreholes via Project Flow.
As well as upgrading our outward-facing capabilities,
we have pressed ahead with fundamental internal
changes that will make us more agile, efficient,
inclusive and collaborative. After decentralizing
UNHCR’s structure in 2020, our focus shifted to
upgrading systems and simplifying processes
through the Business Transformation Programme,
taking advantage of cloud-based technology.
Importantly, COMPASS – our new results-based
management system – was rolled out. The system
will allow us to improve multi-year planning and align
our plans with development actors and international
financial institutions.

Knowing what we know about the needs of forcibly
displaced and stateless people, and about the
case for including them in development planning
and seeking solutions to their plight, we cannot
allow UNHCR’s work to continue to be routinely
underfunded. We have broadened our funding
base but we must do more to secure new sources
of funding. In 2021, available funding covered only
56% of budgeted needs, down from 59% in 2020.
Underfunding presents us with a cruel dilemma:
it is inhumane not to fund nutrition, shelter, health
and support for survivors of gender-based violence,
but it is a false economy to fail to fund education,
integration, repatriation and climate action. UNHCR
is striving to mobilize more funds, especially flexible
funding, to allow us to do more. We are seeking to
broaden our donor base, with more development
funding, more private sector funding, and innovative
opportunities in Islamic financing.
Our task is growing and becoming more complex.
But we are determined to deliver, bolstered by
a burgeoning global network of partners, and
heartened by the great reserves of altruism,
solidarity and generosity that persist in – and
perhaps because of – our troubled world.

The data are generally provided by governments, based on their own definitions and methods
of data collection. A dash (“-”) indicates that the value is zero, not available or not applicable.
All data are provisional and subject to change. More information on people of concern to
UNHCR in 2021, including statistical trends and changes of global displacement during the
year, can be found in the 2021 Global Trends report.				
				
¹ This category includes groups of people who are outside their country or territory of origin
and who face protection risks similar to those of refugees, but for whom refugee status has, for
practical or other reasons, not been ascertained.				
					
² Asylum seekers are individuals who have sought international protection and whose claims
for refugee status have not yet been determined. This table includes claimants whose
individual applications were pending at the end of 2021, irrespective of when those claims may
have been lodged.
		
³ Refugees who have returned to their place of origin during 2021. Source: country of origin
and asylum.							
				
⁴ For the purposes of UNHCR’s statistics, this population includes only conflict-generated IDPs
to whom the Office extends protection and/or assistance.		
⁵ IDPs of concern to UNHCR who have returned to their place of origin during 2021.	
						
⁶ Refers to persons who are not considered as nationals by any State under the operation of
its law. This category refers to persons who fall under the agency’s statelessness mandate
because they are stateless according to this international definition, but data from some
countries may also include persons with undetermined nationality. The figure reported
includes stateless persons who are also refugees or asylum seekers from Myanmar, IDPs in
Myanmar, or others of concern to UNHCR. UNHCR’s statistical reporting generally follows a
methodology that reports on one legal status for each person of concern only. However, due to
the extraordinary size of the displaced stateless population from Myanmar, UNHCR considers
it important to reflect the dual status that this population group possesses. Additional stateless
refugees, asylum seekers, and IDPs will be reported on as UNHCR continues to review and
improve its reporting on stateless persons with a dual status.			
						
⁷ Refers to individuals who do not necessarily fall directly into any of these groups above but to
whom UNHCR has extended its protection and/or assistance services, based on humanitarian
or other special grounds. In 2021, this excludes host communities that are assisted by UNHCR,
which are now reported separately (see annex 11 of Global Trends report).		
				
⁸ Venezuelans displaced abroad refers to persons of Venezuelan origin who are likely to be
in need of international protection under the criteria contained in the Cartagena Declaration,
but who have not applied for asylum in the country in which they are present. Regardless of
status, Venezuelans displaced abroad require protection against forced returns, and access
to basic services. UNHCR and the International Organization for Migration work together with
this population by leading the Regional Inter-Agency Coordination Platform, which is aimed at
strengthening the protection dimensions and consistent responses across the region in line
with human rights standards.

16 UNHCR GLOBAL REPORT 2021

As of 2022, UNHCR adopted a new global results framework, which uses a simplified and more flexible
results structure, aligned with the Global Compact on Refugees and the Sustainable Development Goals, and
enables multi-year planning. This is supported by COMPASS, a new planning, budgeting, monitoring and
reporting system – and a core component of UNHCR’s Business Transformation Programme. Thus, 2021 will
be the final year that the Global Strategic Priorities will be reported on.
UNHCR used the new global results framework for targets in its Global Appeal 2022 and will use those
targets to show results in the Global Report 2022. Reporting on UNHCR’s achievements in meeting the
challenges across all GSP areas in 2021 can be found in the thematic chapters of this Global Report.

REGION

BUDGET

This chapter presents an overview of
UNHCR’s requirements, income and
expenditure in 2021. More detailed
information can be found on UNHCR’s main
operational reporting platform,
Global Focus.

The Executive Committee, at its 70th session
in October 2019, approved an original
global needs-based budget for 2021 of
$8.616 billion as part of the biennial
2020-2021 budget. At its 71st session in
October 2020, the Executive Committee
approved a revised budget, with the same
level of $8.616 billion for 2021.

UNHCR’s final 2021 budget was $9.248 billion,
having increased from the 2021 revised
budget of $8.616 billion. Four supplementary
budgets totalling $631.7 million were added
during the year.
Expenditure rose 1.7% to $4.918 billion,
leading to a record implementation rate
(expenditure over total funds available)
of 95%.
Global Strategic Priorities
Mobilization of support
See p. 17 for GSP result

The final budget represents the sum of
the approved revised budget of $8.616
billion and four supplementary budgets
of $631.7 million. It comprised programmed
activities of $8.813 billion; an operational
reserve of $402 million; the “new or
additional activities – mandate-related”
(NAM) reserve of $20 million; and
$12 million for Junior Professional Officers.

Funds available reached $5.153 billion,
leaving an overall funding gap – funds
available compared to the needs-based
budget of $9.248 billion – of 44%,
compared to 41% in 2020. The funding gap
affected all regions, but particularly the
three Africa regions.

Programmed activities are field operations; global programmes, which are technical
activities undertaken by Headquarters, but which are of direct benefit to field operations;
and the work of Headquarters to provide leadership and management, policy guidance,
administrative support, and managerial and programmatic assistance to the field.

and the Great Lakes region for Ethiopia
($245 million), Sudan ($268 million) and
Uganda ($345 million); in Europe for Greece
($151 million) and Türkiye ($350 million);
and in the Middle East and North Africa
for Jordan ($406 million) and Lebanon
($553 million).
The second largest component of the
programmed activities was Pillar 4 (global
IDP projects) at 17% of the requirements.
The major operations continued to be in
the Middle East and North Africa, namely
Iraq ($245 million), the Syrian Arab Republic
($251 million) and Yemen ($203 million).
Regionally, the largest requirements
were in the Middle East and North Africa
at $2.702 billion, or 31% of the total
requirements for programmed activities,
and in the East and Horn of Africa and the
Great Lakes region, at $1.902 billion or 22%
of the total. This is reflective of a series of
protracted and overlapping crises in these
two regions.

Expenditure totalled $4.918 billion, with
an increase of $80.3 million or 1.7% in
comparison with the expenditure of
$4.838 billion of 2020. This resulted in an
implementation rate (expenditure over
total funds available) of 95% for 2021. Below
are regional expenditure rates and selected
operational highlights.

By pillar
Under Pillar 1 (global refugee programme),
expenditure of $3.859 billion accounted
for 78.5% of UNHCR’s total expenditure.
There was a slight decrease of $25.4 million
or 0.7% compared to $3.884 billion in 2020,
mainly attributable to the operation
in Greece, where the integration and
accommodation emergency programme
was handed over to the Government.
Under Pillar 2 (global stateless programme),
expenditure of $39.9 million decreased
by $1.4 million, or 3.5% compared to
expenditure of $41.3 million in 2020, and
accounted for approximately 1% of total
expenditure. In the Democratic Republic of
the Congo (DRC), the collection of qualitative
data on statelessness was prioritized.

Under Pillar 3 (global reintegration projects),
expenditure of $234.7 million was
$23 million or 10.9% higher than 2020
expenditure of $211.7 million and accounted
for 5% of total expenditure. In Afghanistan,
communities already supported were
provided with additional cash assistance
and increased support for basic services. In
Burundi, 66,000 returnees were supported
with sustainable reintegration. In the Syrian
Arab Republic, as part of the “whole of
Syria” response, UNHCR is a co-lead of the
protection, shelter and CCCM cluster
responses. In 2021, UNHCR bolstered local
area-based programming and multisectoral
assistance, including core relief items and
shelter support.
Under Pillar 4 (global IDP projects),
expenditure of $784.9 million increased by
$84.1 million or 12% compared to 2020
expenditure of $700.7 million and accounted
for 16% of total expenditure. These increases
addressed increased internal displacement in
Afghanistan, El Salvador, Ethiopia, Honduras
and Mozambique. UNHCR scaled up
protection services and delivered assistance,
and proactively engaged with IDPs on
durable solutions, including by facilitating
voluntary return when feasible and advocating
for alternatives when returns were not viable.

2020 final expenditure

2021 final expenditure

By region
In West and Central Africa, expenditure
remained relatively stable at $446 million,
up by $3.6 million or 0.8% from
$442.5 million in 2020. The main increases
were in Cameroon, Chad and Côte d’Ivoire.
In the Lake Chad Basin, more than
3 million IDPs and over 327,000 refugees
were displaced, including across
Cameroon, Chad, Niger and Nigeria.
UNHCR also organized the repatriation
of some 33,700 refugees, most notably
to Côte d’Ivoire (22,500). Expenditure
increases were offset by reductions in Niger
due to the reprioritization of activities within
the region.
 
In the East and Horn of Africa and the Great
Lakes, home to 48% of the continent’s
people of concern, expenditure grew to
$990.3 million from $863.3 million in 2020,
an increase of $127 million or 14.7%. Major
increases were in Burundi, Ethiopia (related to
the Tigray emergency), Sudan and Uganda.

22 UNHCR GLOBAL REPORT 2021

Expenditure in Southern Africa amounted
to $211.3 million, an increase of 5.9% or
$11.8 million compared to expenditure of
$199.5 million in 2020. The main increases
were in Mozambique, where the conflict
in Cabo Delgado province has internally
displaced 745,000 people; and the Republic
of the Congo, where UNHCR supported
a Government initiative during which
25,000 undocumented Congolese received
a birth certificate.
Expenditure in the Middle East and North
Africa amounted to $1.286 billion, a
decrease of $66.7 million or 4.9% when
compared to expenditure of $1.353 billion
in 2020. The main decreases were in
Lebanon and Libya. In Lebanon, currency
devaluation resulted in the operation being
able to deliver assistance as planned,
particularly when it came to cash grants
which are disbursed in local currency.

In Libya, there was a reduction in IDPs
from 278,000 in January to 179,000 at
year end. Decreases were partially offset
by expenditure increases in Egypt, Iraq,
Jordan and Yemen. In Yemen, 287,000
people were newly displaced, taking the
number of IDPs in the country to almost
4.3 million.
In Asia and the Pacific, expenditure
stood at $543 million, an increase of
$100.1 million or 22.6% compared to
expenditure of $442.9 million in 2020. This
was mainly due to the Afghan situation
with major increases in the operations for
the Islamic Republics of Afghanistan, Iran
and Pakistan; Kazakhstan and Tajikistan.
Expenditure increases were partially
offset by decreases in Bangladesh,
where services in the refugee camps had
been limited due to COVID-19 restriction
measures and were only fully restored by
the end of 2021.
Expenditure for Europe amounted to
$359.1 million, a decrease of $150 million
or 29.5% compared to expenditure of
$509.1 million in 2020. This was mainly
due to the transfer of the integration and
accommodation emergency programme to
the Government of Greece, on 1 October
2021, completing a phased transition.
UNHCR refocused its plans on core
protection activities and support to the
integration of recognized refugees,
including ensuring quality access to
territory and asylum.
Expenditure for the Americas amounted to
$415.4 million, an increase of $94.5 million
or 29.5% compared to expenditure of
$320.8 million in 2020. The increase
was spread across the region, with
most significant growth in Colombia,
El Salvador, Guatemala and Mexico.

Mexico became the third-largest recipient
of asylum claims in the world with more
than 130,000 new asylum applications in
2021. In Colombia, more than 1.8 million
applicants for Temporary Protection Status
from the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela
were registered, as were 124,000 newly
displaced Colombians. In El Salvador,
Guatemala and Honduras, UNHCR
supported a range of multisectoral services
under the humanitarian response plans.

Global programmes and
Headquarters
Global programme expenditures amounted
to $415.2 million, a decrease of $71 million
or 14.6% compared to expenditure of
$486.3 million in 2020. The decrease is
attributable to some centrally managed
expenditures now being accounted
for under the relevant field operations;
emergency stockpiles for COVID-19related items no longer required in 2021;
expenditure for Global Fleet Management
being accounted for under a separate fund;
and reductions in the need for certain items,
such as refugee housing units under the
Division of Resilience and Solutions and ICT
equipment under the Division of Information
Systems and Technology.
Headquarters expenditures amounted to
$243 million, an increase of $31.6 million
or 15% compared to expenditure of
$211.4 million in 2020. This is in part
due to investments in the Business
Transformation Programme, in ICT security
and infrastructure, and rent and one-time
refurbishment costs related to Global
Service Centre premises in Budapest.

Coordination in refugee situations
Regional Refugee Response Plans were
issued for Afghanistan, Burundi, the
Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia
and South Sudan. Established mechanisms
such as the 3RP for the Syria crisis (co-led
with UNDP) and the Regional Refugee and
Migrant Response Plan (RMRP) for refugees
and migrants from the Bolivarian Republic
of Venezuela (co-led with IOM) raised
resources and ensured linkages between
humanitarian action, resilience activities
and development approaches. UNHCR and

Expenditure via partners
UNHCR worked with its 1,151 partners to
support the implementation of simplified
partnership arrangements introduced at the
end of 2020 which gave partners greater
flexibility than in previous years. The Office
started to develop a Project Reporting
Oversight and Monitoring Solution (PROMS),
which will bring partnership management
processes together in one place and is
expected to be rolled out globally in 2023.
UNHCR worked with other UN agencies to
harmonize partnership practices, including
a new framework for joint project audits
of shared partners.  

17 UN agencies
$22.2M

Final expenditure data showed UNHCR
disbursed $1.417 billion to its partners. The
number of local and national responders
receiving funding from UNHCR (including
non-governmental and civil society
organizations, as well as government
partners) reached 950 or 83% of all partners,
the highest figure to date. Some 25% of
global UNHCR programme expenditure was
implemented through local and national
responders, meeting the Grand Bargain
commitment of 25% for the third year in a
row. UNHCR also piloted a new lighter grant
agreement with organizations led by people
of concern in 8 operations, to ensure that
displaced and host communities are treated
as equal and active partners.

OVERVIEW I FUNDING UNHCR’s PROGRAMMES

UNHCR funded $213.7 million of
expenditure from indirect support costs,
$180.6 million at Headquarters and
$33 million in the regions.
Earmarked voluntary contributions funded
51% of UNHCR operations, softly earmarked

respectively.

Global Strategic Priorities
Financial Accountability
and Oversight
See p. 15 for GSP result

Throughout the year, UNHCR’s programmes
were carried out in an environment of sound
financial accountability and oversight.
The year included significant crisis in
banking infrastructure in Afghanistan and
Ethiopia which required innovative and
creative solutions to providing financial
support in the field. For the future, UNHCR
is in the process of implementing new
financial enterprise resource planning,
and significant efforts were spent in 2021
understanding the selected tools in order to
plan the areas of financial management and
internal controls that could be strengthened
leveraging the new tools.

Accounts were recorded in full compliance
with IPSAS. UNHCR finished the closure of
the 2020 accounts, supporting the audit,
and ultimately obtained an unqualified
opinion on its financial statements.
The fieldwork for the 2021 audit was
supported with results expected in 2022.
UNHCR delivered cash assistance of
$668 million, with full adoption of financial
procedures and control frameworks
embedded in the system. Oversight and
expertise in financial and risk management
were provided throughout to ensure
compliance of financial policies and
procedures. Operations implementing
cash assistance were supported by further
guidance on financial risk management
and provision of due diligence and risk
assessment during procurement of financial
service providers. More operations
deployed UNHCR cash assistance
management system and corporate
biometric verification tools, resulting in the
reduction of manual processes, increased
automation and enhanced end-to-end
traceability of individual payment records.
UNHCR has also made solid progress
towards creating a central banking
connectivity platform to enhance access
to global financial ecosystems, providing
transfer modalities directly to people of
concern effectively, securely and in an
inclusive manner.

OVERVIEW I FUNDING UNHCR’s PROGRAMMES

OVERVIEW I FUNDING UNHCR’s PROGRAMMES

UNHCR’s top donors were the United
States of America ($1.872 billion), Germany
($488 million), and the European Union
($327 million). Several public sector donors
significantly increased their contributions in
2021; France more than doubled its giving
in 2021, providing $101 million, up 128% from
2020. Italy's contribution increased by 83%
in 2021, to $68.8 million. Austria provided
$29.8 million, an increase of 196% from
2020. Other notable increases included
a 57% increase from Luxembourg (to
$13.6 million), a 202% increase from China
(to $5.3 million), and increases above 100%
from Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia.

INCOME
UNHCR raised $4.680 billion in
contributions in 2021, including funds to
support activities beyond 2021 and the
assessed contribution of the UN Regular
Budget of $43.2 million. UNHCR’s available
resources totalled $5.153 billion when
carry-over, contributions from past years,
and other funds available and adjustments
are considered. This is a slight decrease
from the $5.404 billion available in 2020.
In 2020, funds available reached 59% of
global budget requirements; in 2021, this
dropped to 56%.
In 2021 UNHCR counted 71 governments,
the European Union, and three other
intergovernmental donors among its public
sector supporters.

Overall contributions from public
sector donors declined slightly in 2021,
decreasing from $4.199 billion in 2020
to $4.011 billion. The sharpest declines
were from the European Union (which
contributed $195 million less in 2021, a
decrease of 37%), the United Kingdom
(which dropped 46% from $134.7 million
to $72.9 million), the United States (which
contributed $101 million less in 2021 while
remaining UNHCR’s top donor) and CERF,

Quality of income
Early and flexible contributions smooth
the delivery of life-saving assistance and
protection to millions of people. While
tightly earmarked and delayed contributions
are also valuable – comprising a large

proportion of funds administered by
UNHCR – such contributions introduce
additional layers of administrative burden
and cost.

Without flexible support, variable levels
of donor interest would determine the
scale of humanitarian response provided
to certain populations or emergencies,
a scenario which could undermine core
humanitarian principles of humanity,
neutrality, impartiality and independence.
Thanks to the generous flexible support of
many donors, UNHCR was able to direct
resources to situations of highest need and
to minimize inequities in provision of lifesaving aid.

resulting in contributions totalling
$1.140 billion as of 1 January 2021, an
increase of 18% over contributions received
at the start of 2020. A stronger financial

that operations were able to start or continue

“Humanitarian needs are at an all-time high, and there is an increasing gap between needs and available
funding. Therefore, it is indispensable to render the humanitarian system more efficient, and enable it to react
swiftly. This is why Germany has undertaken significant efforts at the national level as well as in international
fora to increase flexible, multi-year, and anticipatory funding. UNHCR is a close partner in this regard, whom
we aim to provide with the necessary flexibility to adapt to rapidly evolving crises like Afghanistan or the
COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, a regional approach also enables a swift reprogramming of funds to neighbouring
countries when needed. We encourage other donors and partners to also step up their quality funding and to
shape the humanitarian system in accordance with the Grand Bargain.”

To counteract the longer-term trend of
increasingly restricted funds, UNHCR
is amplifying its efforts to communicate
the Office’s global impact and funding
requirements in key thematic areas.
UNHCR’s work in education, gender
equality and gender-based violence, and
climate action were profiled in the 2022
Global Appeal and will be the focus of
intensified fundraising for flexible support.

Multi-year funding
Multi-year funding supports UNHCR and
its partners by expanding the planning
horizon and mitigating the negative impact
of income fluctuations throughout the
year. Having a reliable future funding base
ensures continuity of supply chains, staffing
capabilities in the field, and core operations.

CHART 11

Multi-year funding available to UNHCR in
2021 totalled $575.1 million. Furthermore,
UNHCR signed 62 multi-year agreements
with a total value of over $1.2 billion with
45 different donors in 2021 which will
underpin the work of UNHCR through
2022 and beyond; Sweden and Denmark
are the largest contributors in both
absolute terms and also in the total amount
of multi-year, unearmarked resources.
Although the agreements and amounts are
welcome, the total amount of multi-year
funding is not sufficient to allow UNHCR
to fully cascade this to partners while
maintaining its own flexibility and start-up
costs for any given year.

Innovative funding

In-kind contributions supported premises

partners, and materials for people of
concern. The value of in-kind support has
more than quadrupled in the last two years,
growing from $32 million in 2019 to over

Innovative financing at UNHCR refers to
financial arrangements to support UNHCR’s
mission that involve other modalities beyond
traditional pure grant funding and helps bring
in a wider range of stakeholders, in line with
the Global Compact on Refugees. Since
starting innovative financing work two years
ago, UNHCR has made strong progress.
Highlights include: 

$140 million in 2021. Most of this increase
was from private sector donations, including
major clothing donations and large
quantities of hygiene products and medical
PPE for the COVID-19 response.

H&M and INDITEX stepping up with in-kind
support
One of the world’s largest fashion retailers, H&M Group,
entered into a long-term partnership agreement with Sweden
for UNHCR, donating new clothing worth nearly $13.5 million to
displaced families in Iraq. The contribution was one of the major
donations of its kind to UNHCR’s Iraq operation in 2021, helping
more than 250,000 children, women and men keep warm
during the winter. 
Thanks to a generous contribution from INDITEX, the world largest fashion retailer, more than 2 million
pieces of new clothing and other items were donated and distributed to refugees and IDPs in countries
including Burkina Faso and Uganda. This has enabled thousands of women, men and children to
use the money previously set aside for clothing to meet other needs, such as food and education.
This in-kind gift, brokered by UNHCR’s National Partner España con ACNUR and valued at nearly
$23.7 million, is part of a long-term partnership that ensures the sustainability of a clothing donation
programme to UNHCR.

Building on 2020’s exceptional gains,
there was continued strong support from
private donors in 2021. UNHCR and its
National Partners generated $625.3 million
of income: $377.2 million from individual
donors and $248.1 million from companies,

foundations and philanthropists. This
represented growth of 16% year-on-year,
far exceeding 2021’s fundraising target
of $510 million, and accounted for 13%
of overall funding. Over $281 million was

Emergency appeals remained a crucial
driver of private donor fundraising
for UNHCR’s response to protracted
and escalating crises in Afghanistan,
Bangladesh, the Democratic Republic of the
Congo, Ethiopia, Myanmar, South Sudan,
the Syrian Arab Republic and Yemen,
among others. Emergency appeals brought
in more than $267 million, some 43% of
UNHCR’s total private donor income.
Key fundraising campaigns such as the
annual Winter Campaign and the launch of
Aiming Higher to support tertiary education
also brought positive results.

© UNHCR/Antoine Tardy

Global campaigns raised over $27.8 million
in 2021
UNHCR launched Aiming Higher in 2021, a new campaign
to raise funds for the Refugee Scholarship Programme, and
one which contributes to UNHCR’s objective to boost refugee
enrolment in higher education from 3% to 15% by 2030. In 2021,
the campaign raised $7.5 million to cover four-year scholarships
for 488 refugee scholars.
The Winter Campaign, which ended in March 2021, raised
$17.5 million for UNHCR’s winterization efforts. The Ramadan Campaign was launched globally for the
third year, raising $2.6 million from countries outside the Middle East and North Africa region – growth
of 271% since 2019. Some 46% of global Ramadan donations went to UNHCR’s Refugee Zakat Fund,
a sharia-compliant distributor of Zakat donations. The innovative Connecting Worlds app was successfully
redeveloped in 2021 to move the app from pilot phase to a more robust tool to raise funds for cash
assistance. In late 2021, two markets launched the campaign which, by year’s end, had raised over
$250,000, supporting 115 families for a full year.

The strategic push to diversify the channels
used to acquire new supporters meant
UNHCR had options available when the
pandemic led to restrictions on face-to-face
fundraising, UNHCR’s primary source of
new individual donors. Despite the adverse
impact of COVID-19, this channel has
proved robust and is returning to strength,
growing the number of UNHCR donors
to almost 2.9 million through this
challenging period.

36 UNHCR GLOBAL REPORT 2021

The growth in support from corporations,
foundations and private philanthropists in
2020 extended into 2021 and resulted in a
rise in income of 25% in 2021, generating
$248.1 million. In 2021, UNHCR received the
largest-in kind donations to date from GAP
Inc. ($34.3 million), INDITEX ($23.7 million)
and H&M ($13.5 million).

Through his foundation, H.E Sheikh Thani
Bin Abdullah Bin Thani Al-Thani contributed
$18.7 million to operations in Yemen,
Lebanon, Bangladesh, Pakistan and Chad,
making him the largest individual donor
to UNHCR for a further year. Other major
cash contributions came from the LEGO
Foundation ($4.8 million) and Mr. Tadashi
Yanai ($4 million).

The level of income was the result of wide
collaboration across the organization,
supported by a long-term strategy to
engage with the private sector to raise
flexible funding for UNHCR to respond
wherever it is most needed.

Private donors played a vital role in emergencies,
donating over $267 million in 2021
UNHCR declared 40 new emergencies in 29 countries.
These included some countries, such as the Democratic Republic
of the Congo (DRC), having two or three new emergencies in the
same year. The DRC was affected by both a new influx of refugees
from the Central African Republic in January and by a devastating
volcanic eruption in Goma in May. Generous and timely emergency
contributions from private donors – including over $90 million from
individuals and some $177 million from private sector partners
– supported new and ongoing crises such as the one in the DRC, as well those
in Afghanistan, the fire and monsoon in Bangladesh, the Central African Republic, the Far North region of
Cameroon, northern Ethiopia, the Haiti earthquake, Mozambique, Myanmar, the Sahel, the Syrian Arab
Republic, the Venezuela situation and Yemen. Private donors also contributed to UNHCR’s COVID-19
response, as well as to the climate crisis, which is already disproportionately affecting people forced to
flee in many countries.

Income from national partners
UNHCR maintained positive, strategic
relations with its nine National Partners. In
2021, their contribution accounted for 58%
of private sector income, with España con
ACNUR again the largest contributor with
$121.1 million, of which over $83.8 million
was unearmarked. In addition to their
financial contributions (particularly the high
level of unearmarked funding), UNHCR’s
nine National Partners played a vital role as
a bridge between the public and UNHCR
and helped encourage a whole-of-society
response, especially in times of crises. An
example of this was USA for UNHCR’s
grassroots campaign for COVID-19 vaccine
equity for vulnerable populations. National
Partners worked to encourage inclusive
and welcoming communities. This took
many forms, from supporting employment
and mentoring initiatives to promoting
community support. In Germany, besides

UNO-Flüchtlingshilfe’s contribution to
UNHCR, more than 80 projects for refugees
were supported with $2.4 million. Another
key area of work was engaging with the
media to build a positive narrative around
refugees and counter misinformation
and stereotyping. Research by IPSOS
on attitudes towards refugees found
that in the two years since the launch of
UNHCR’s National Partner in Argentina,
the confidence of Argentines in refugees
successfully integrating in the country
reached 60%, making Argentina one of the
most open places for the forcibly displaced.
Australia for UNHCR | 2021 was a year of
unsurpassed generosity from Australia’s
donors, with around one third of funds raised
for Afghanistan. Celebrated Australian artist
Ben Quilty helped to drive the Afghanistan
campaign, which drew support from
philanthropists as well as corporate partners
including Canva and Deloitte.

After a challenging year in 2019, when
growth in private sector income slowed
for UNHCR and many peer organizations,
2020 and 2021 saw a return to doubledigit annual growth, with UNHCR private
sector funding rising by $204 million in
that period. This was a result of a generous
response from civil society across the world
to the uncertainties arising from COVID-19,
and the agility of UNHCR’s private sector
fundraising teams which adapted quickly
to the new conditions and engaged
supporters with compelling narratives
about the impact on forcibly displaced and
stateless people.

Japan responding to calls to support people
forced to flee. The Sports for Refugees
campaign in collaboration with World
Refugee Day events engaged Japanese
audiences in light of the Tokyo 2020
Games. Collaboration with companies
was developed with Toyota Tsusho
Corporation’s in-kind contribution being a
first of its kind.
Sweden for UNHCR | Growth came
from individual giving, which has almost
doubled since 2019, and from corporate
partners, foundations and philanthropists.
This included strategic partnerships with
H&M Group with a historical level of in-kind
donations; Solvatten with in-kind support
to Uganda; the Swedish Postcode Lottery’s
unearmarked funding; and a partnership
with Dreamfund. UNHCR’s 70-year
anniversary was communicated through a
podcast series with well-known Swedes
telling their stories of displacement, leading
to an increase of brand awareness and in
turn promoting income growth.
Switzerland for UNHCR | 2021 was its
first fully operational year after its creation
in 2020. Four direct mail campaigns were
launched while digital infrastructure was
being set up. Strategic partnerships with
foundations, companies and philanthropists
were developed, and public engagement
events were also organized, such as
with Servette FC and the Latour Geneva
Triathlon. 2021 also saw fundraising
innovation with the launch of UNHCR’s firstever non-fungible token.
UK for UNHCR | Activities in its second
year included launching a multi-channel
individual giving programme and building
new corporate, trust and foundation
partnerships. There was support for
Afghanistan, Ethiopia and Yemen, as well
as the Winter Campaign and Aiming Higher
to help more refugees access tertiary
education.

To mark UNHCR’s 70th anniversary, UK
for UNHCR led a national campaign to
create the Refugee Dictionary, capturing
the stories of survival made possible by
the Refugee Convention, and which was
presented to the British Library as a record
of national solidarity.
UNO-Flüchtlingshilfe (Germany) |
The World Refugee Day campaign was
supported by Spotify Germany as well as
well-known actors and artists. With the
new podcast “Beweggründe” (Motives),
the gaming campaign “Flucht ist kein
Spiel” (“Flight is not a game”), charity
livestreams, and cooperation with the
Börsenverein des Deutschen Buchhandels
(German Publishers and Booksellers
Association), the organization expanded to
reach new audiences. In September, the
Berliner Philharmoniker and its principal
conductor, Kirill Petrenko, became
UNO-Flüchtlingshilfe ambassadors. The
partnership with Volkswagen Group also
moved from strength to strength: the
group funded 70 scholarships for the
DAFI programme to mark UNHCR’s 70th
anniversary and provided vehicles to
support World Refugee Day and face-toface fundraising.
USA for UNHCR | In response to the
Afghanistan crisis, USA for UNHCR
generated more than $8 million, including
financial resources from more than 25 new,
existing and lapsed private sector partners
such as the Coca-Cola Foundation,
Facebook, Baker McKenzie and Google.
Islamic philanthropy efforts continued to
mature thanks in part to new partnerships
with IFANCA and Fair Fintech and the
launch of an Islamic Philanthropy Council.
Throughout the year, the organization
lifted the voices of refugees in the United
States – highlighted through the Refugee
Youth Storyteller Celebration – bringing
Americans together to advocate for and
support refugees. USA for UNHCR was
named a Great Place to Work for the second
year in a row.

OVERVIEW I GLOBAL INITIATIVES

OVERVIEW I GLOBAL INITIATIVES

UNHCR’s strategy emphasized including
people of concern in national vaccination
and recovery plans, the vital role played by
community information networks, and the
value of cash assistance in mitigating the
most acute impacts.

Global
initiatives

Over the course of the year, 19.7 million
people in 148 countries accessed UNHCR
protection services in the context of
COVID-19. COVID-19-related border
closures and entry restrictions were eased
in many countries, facilitating access to
territory and safety for people seeking
asylum, as monitored by UNHCR. Advocacy
for inclusion in national systems and plans
also bore fruit, with 162 countries including
refugees in national vaccination plans. By
the end of 2021, 4.79 million vaccine doses
had been distributed to over 3.25 million
forcibly displaced people in 66 countries
where UNHCR was able to record data.
Another 72 countries confirmed they had
started vaccinating forcibly displaced
and stateless people, but the data is not
available to UNHCR. While encouraging
progress, the unequal availability of
vaccines slowed down vaccination roll-outs.

RESPONDING TO COVID-19
IN 2021
In 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic evolved
into a more regular but no less damaging
pattern after the initial shock of travel bans
and lockdowns. UNHCR issued a COVID-19
supplementary appeal at the end of 2020,
having introduced operational adaptations

56 UNHCR GLOBAL REPORT 2021

to maintain protection and assistance.
As States relaxed travel restrictions and
adopted national plans for vaccines,
distance learning, and social and
employment protection, UNHCR strove
to ensure forcibly displaced and stateless
people – disproportionately disadvantaged
by COVID-19 – were not left behind. As
well as access to territory and asylum,

UNHCR also provided recommendations
for the inclusion of stateless populations,
whose lack of legal status put them
at added risk of being excluded. In
Bangladesh and Malawi, UNHCR
successfully advocated for and supported
the inclusion of stateless people in national
COVID-19 vaccination plans, and over
330,000 stateless Rohingya refugees in
Bangladesh received at least one dose by
the end of 2021, out of 420,000 eligible
by age. UNHCR procured and delivered
personal protective equipment and
other critical items and services worth
$69.1 million to 75 operations, including
532,000 antigen rapid diagnostic tests,
and supported national health systems with
laboratory testing and diagnostic capacity,
quarantine and treatment centres, and

equipment for intensive care units.
COVID-19’s socioeconomic impact on
forcibly displaced and stateless people
was widespread and significant. With
support from the UNHCR-World Bank Joint
Data Center, IDP samples were included
in high-frequency phone surveys, in
Burkina Faso and Iraq for example, to
monitor the experience of IDPs and their
host communities during the pandemic.
In Iraq, data showed unemployment was
higher and educational engagement lower
for IDPs and returnees than non-displaced
households, and IDPs’ food consumption
also deteriorated significantly during the
pandemic. A study in Libya found forcibly
displaced people were about 60% more
likely than others to report negative
economic and health impacts, despite
similar infection rates.
Data gathered through telephone surveys
in Bangladesh, Chad, Djibouti, Ethiopia, Iraq,
Kenya, Uganda and Yemen also showed
deteriorations in the socioeconomic wellbeing of refugees and host populations,
with setbacks in health access, education,
wages and employment, non-labour income
and food security. In Chad, for example,
75% of the refugee and host population
reported drops in income. Similar shocks
were recorded for IDPs, for example in Iraq,
Jordan and Lebanon. Projections showed
an estimated 4.4 million people in host
communities and 1.1 million refugees
or IDPs were driven into poverty during
the pandemic.
Livelihoods programming was part
of UNHCR’s COVID-19 response in
30 countries, including large projects in
Burkina Faso, Cameroon and Chad, and the
overall volume of these interventions more
than tripled from 2020. UNHCR developed
specific COVID-19-related livelihood and
economic inclusion strategies in seven
countries in response to the pandemic’s
socioeconomic impact, with support

UNHCR GLOBAL REPORT 2021 57

-----------------------Page 30 End-----------------------

OVERVIEW I GLOBAL INITIATIVES

including poverty reduction through the
graduation approach, artisanal production,
business creation and asset transfers, and
training on livelihoods and economic inclusion
in the context of emergency preparedness.
UNHCR followed a November 2020
study of “Social protection responses to
COVID-19 for forcibly displaced persons”
with three further studies on inclusion
in social protection in post-pandemic
Europe, Africa and World Bank-funded
social protection projects. The latter
report stated “the COVID-19 pandemic
is proving to be a turning point in some
refugee-hosting countries and represents
another opportunity to promote inclusion.”
During 2021, 2.8 million refugees and
asylum seekers affected by COVID-19
in 84 countries received increased or
expanded social protection.
Cash assistance remained an efficient tool
to respond to protection and basic needs,
as well as a key approach to unlocking
the potential for sustainable financial
inclusion for people of concern and bridging
the gap toward broader inclusion and
fostering resilience. UNHCR delivered
almost $670 million in cash assistance to
9.3 million people in nearly 100 countries.
6 million received digital payments, a quarter
of whom had their own bank or mobile
money account. This was a pathway to
financial inclusion. 95% of respondents in
post-distribution monitoring reported cash
assistance improved their living conditions
and helped reduce feelings of stress, although
for the majority it enabled them to meet only
half or less of their basic needs. 77% of
households surveyed in 44 countries reported
engaging in one or more negative coping
mechanisms, including a reduction in spending
on education, to meet their basic needs.
The pandemic reversed important gains
in gender equality and women’s and
girls’ rights, and exacerbated risks of
gender-based violence.

58 UNHCR GLOBAL REPORT 2021

OVERVIEW I GLOBAL INITIATIVES

Lockdowns amplified gender differences
in access to health, childcare, education
and employment, with harmful
consequences for women and girls
already subjected to intersecting forms
of discrimination. UNHCR’s genderbased violence services were available to
survivors in 96 countries in 2021. Access
to dedicated safe spaces and targeted
assistance, including cash, was crucial
for survivors of gender-based violence
and persons at risk. In the Central
African Republic, the “Ma Mbi Si” project
(“Listen to me, too”) was initiated on the
recommendation of forcibly displaced
women and girls and drew on a large
network of community focal points who
shared information about services. The
project’s hotline and in-person safe
spaces assisted over 3,500 at-risk women
and girls and survivors of gender-based
violence, providing psychosocial support,
cash, medical and legal assistance, and
dignity kits.

with communities and local partners,
including organizations led by refugee and
IDP women. UNHCR scaled up messaging
apps and websites to share life-saving

UNHCR GLOBAL REPORT 2021 59

OVERVIEW I GLOBAL INITIATIVES

Globally, UNHCR’s communication with
communities and accountability to affected
populations continued to be priorities: 89%
of countries inhabited by forcibly displaced
and stateless people were reached
by information campaigns, and 65% of
countries had multi-channel feedback and
response systems.
As with people not forcibly displaced,
vaccine hesitancy affected forcibly
displaced populations. Operations adopted
community-led efforts to counter rumours
and misinformation with timely and accurate
information, both online and offline. The
Refugee Advisory Board in Bulgaria
monitored local rumours and provided
accurate information on a dedicated
website, while UNHCR supported local
emergency committees in Costa Rica with
51 hours of community radio broadcasts on
prevention and vaccination, and workshops
in rural communities to counter vaccine
misinformation. UNHCR coordinated
with partners to ensure information was
consistent and timely, and played an active
role in risk communication and community
engagement structures. The COVID-19
West and Central Africa toolkit collated
videos, audio files and posters to inform
over 30,000 unique visitors. 
 
School closures in 2020 affected 1.6 billion
students globally. In 2021, 57% of refugee or
displaced learners enrolled in school prior
to the pandemic were still unable to access
digital or home learning programmes.
UNESCO projected close to 24 million
learners were at risk of dropping out
of school due to COVID-related school
closures globally. The Malala Foundation
estimated that in countries where access
and enrolment rates for refugee girls
were below 10% prior to the pandemic,
all refugee girls were at risk of dropping
out of school for good.

60 UNHCR GLOBAL REPORT 2021

OVERVIEW I GLOBAL INITIATIVES

To mitigate the damage to education,
UNHCR continued to provide printed takehome materials and ICT online support,
and used radio to disseminate lessons and
content in nearly 60 countries. In these
and other ways, nearly 980,000 students
in 82 countries were assisted to follow
connected or home-based learning
overall. In Bangladesh, the Republic of
the Congo, Egypt, Guatemala, Lebanon,
Malaysia, Mexico, Somalia and Trinidad and
Tobago, UNHCR implemented programmes
designed specifically to encourage girls to
return to school once they reopened.
With the pandemic exacerbating people of
concern’s mental health and psychosocial
hardship, UNHCR provided more than
841,000 people in 85 countries with mental
health and psychosocial support.
UNHCR continued to collaborate closely
with partners. Examples included monthly
online consultations on operational, policy
and advocacy priorities, exchanges with
the High Commissioner, and regional
consultations with over 3,000 participants.
Most of the flexibilities introduced in 2020
for partnership agreements were integrated
into regular arrangements.
COVID-19 weighed heavily on thirdcountry solutions in 2021. The resumption
of normal travel and border regimes was
gradual and piecemeal, preventing a rapid
revival in departures via resettlement and
complementary pathways. However, the
pandemic reinforced the case for inclusion
of forcibly displaced and stateless people,
potentially building momentum for a more
hopeful future.

Continuing UNHCR’s
transformation in 2021
©️UNHCR/Saiyna Bashir

Zia-ur-Rehman teaches basic computer skills and theory to Afghan refugees at the UNHCR vocational centre in Timergera, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan on
September 7, 2021.

In 2016, UNHCR embarked on a significant
transformation process to make it more
agile and responsive with the main goal
being improved delivery of protection,
assistance and solutions for people of
concern. To support this, UNHCR worked to
empower its operations, reduce bureaucracy
and ensure the efficient and effective use of
resources. The Global Compact on Refugees
was part of this transformation.
A major achievement of the reforms
was the January 2020 decentralization
and regionalization into seven regional
bureaux, with the progressive devolution of
decision-making authorities a hallmark of
the transformation. Although the process is
still being fine-tuned, the new architecture
has already passed several “stress tests”,
from the COVID-19 pandemic to new or
worsening emergencies in nearly every
region. An effective Field Reference Group
and structured consultations between
the regional bureaux and Headquarters
divisions and entities contributed to the
progressive consolidation and “fine tuning”
of decentralization and regionalization and
realignment of Headquarters structures.

In 2021, UNHCR’s transformation shifted focus
from structures to systems. Throughout 2021,
Headquarters divisions worked on developing
six new systems that form part of the Business
Transformation Programme. Together the
systems will improve, modernize and simplify
ageing back-office systems by adopting the
latest cloud-based technologies and industry
best practices in programme and partnership,
financial and supply management, human
resources and external engagement and
resource mobilization. Digitization and
integration will facilitate the flow of data
across platforms and the automation and
streamlining of processes, and improve
ways of working. UNHCR colleagues
across the operations mobilized as subject
matter experts to support and advise
on the design of the new systems.
COMPASS – UNHCR’s new results-based
management system for planning – was
the first component of the Business
Transformation Programme to be launched
in early 2021. The remaining Business
Transformation Programme systems will
be rolled out in a phased and coordinated
manner over the next two years.

(GRF), 2021 was dedicated to stocktaking
on progress towards the objectives of the
Global Compact on Refugees (GCR) and the
related pledges and initiatives announced
at the first GRF in 2019, culminating in the
High-Level Officials meeting (HLOM) in
December 2021. In the lead-up to the HLOM,
UNHCR and partners reviewed progress
on pledges and initiatives through regional,
thematic and stakeholder stocktaking
events. The outcomes of these events
were brought to the global discussion in
advance of the HLOM through preparatory
roundtables focused on the release of
the first GCR indicator report, financing,
partnerships, self-reliance and solutions.
Global Compact
on Refugees

Despite being held virtually, the HLOM
attracted over 1,500 participants, including
senior government officials, the private
sector and other stakeholders, and more
than 130 refugees were invited. Despite the

growing challenges of forced displacement,
exacerbated by COVID-19, the international
community sustained its commitment
to the GCR and the implementation of
the pledges made at the first GRF. More
than 50 new pledges were announced
in the areas of resettlement, asylum
capacity support, civil registration and
self-reliance. Important initiatives were
launched, such as the Operational Strategy
for Climate Resilience and Environmental
Sustainability 2022-2025, the Refugee
Environmental Protection (REP) Fund, the
International Finance Corporation-UNHCR
joint initiative on “Private sector solutions
for the displaced and their hosts”, and
the Refugee Connected Education
Challenge. The HLOM resulted in 20 key
recommendations with follow-up actions,
which will guide the strategy and cultivation
of pledges and initiatives for the next
GRF in 2023.
More than 200 additional pledges were
submitted following the GRF in 2019,
bringing the total number of pledges to
more than 1,600. Three quarters of pledges
updated were reported as in progress, and
more than 160 were fulfilled. Notable
examples were the Government of Spain
delivering on its GRF pledge through its
commitment of 100 million euros to the
Venezuela situation.

Strengthening the evidence base for the GCR
The GCR indicator report describes tangible progress towards the Compact’s objectives and
where more support and engagement is needed to share responsibility for refugee situations. Since
2016, foreign aid to low and middle-income refugee-hosting countries increased and the number of
partners in refugee responses tripled, notably after the affirmation of the GCR; however, funding needs
continued to far exceed available assistance. Three quarters of refugees were allowed to work, yet a
much smaller proportion enjoyed decent work in practice, and one third were prevented from moving
freely. While the pandemic plunged many refugees into extreme poverty, cash transfer programmes
continued to be a major mitigation tool. More refugee children were enrolled in school, but refugee
girls were still less likely to access education. The proportion of refugees accessing durable solutions
has been on a downward trend, with only one in 100 accessing a solution. The report shows that more
equitable responsibility-sharing is not only critically needed but also achievable.

62 UNHCR GLOBAL REPORT 2021

Responsibility-sharing in action
The HLOM highlighted progress made by the three Support Platforms, which are important
mechanisms for the international community to work together in addressing forced displacement and its root
causes. It demonstrated that solutions – the focus of the Support Platforms – require a combination of political
engagement, financial support and technical expertise. Lessons learned since their launch in 2019 show that
the Platforms are most effective when they are flexible and focus on activities and actions at the country level.
This flexibility has proven to be essential, especially in countries such as Afghanistan where, as the
situation deteriorated, the Solutions Strategy for Afghan Refugees Support Platform included emergency
response and preparedness under its remit. It emerged as an agile and action-oriented platform
providing support in an evolving context and also encouraging continued support for the major hosting
countries. Ambassadorial-level meetings of the Support Platform Core Group took place in Kabul,
Islamabad and Tehran. Through the Support Platform Secretariat, Core Group members received realtime information on the evolving situation, dynamics, and movements, allowing them to mobilize and
provide for life-saving multisectoral assistance in Afghanistan, particularly ahead of the harsh winter season.
From the private sector, the LEGO Foundation,
in addition to the $100 million pledged at
the first GRF, provided further funding of
$13 million in the response to the COVID-19
pandemic for playful early learning
opportunities as part of its financial and
technical commitment towards holistic early
childhood development in refugee settings.
In 2021, UNHCR worked with government
and other partners to facilitate matching
of host country policy pledges with
donors’ financial, material and technical
pledges to support policy implementation.
Demonstrating their leadership as GRF coconvenors, Germany matched its pledge of
financial support with Türkiye’s pledge to
increase access to technical and vocational
education and training institutions for
refugee and host community children. The
Asylum Capacity Support Group, another
GCR initiative, also facilitated pledge
matching to strengthen asylum systems of
host countries with several notable matches
made in Africa, Asia and the Americas.
States and other stakeholders also adapted,
accelerated and innovated pledges and
initiatives to support the pandemic response.
The non-profit Kiva Refugee Investment
Fund, for example, accelerated and delivered
on its pledge to provide microcredit loans to
refugees and people in fragile communities.

The final closure of the fund saw it reach
$32.5 million, which will help thousands of
people establish businesses.
Underscoring the importance of the
multistakeholder and partnership
approach set out in the GCR, new and
innovative partnerships emerged that
leveraged complementary strengths,
unlocked resources, and committed to
long-term improvements in people’s
lives. The partnership between Vodafone
Foundation and UNHCR under the Instant
Network Schools initiative to connect
500,000 refugee students and their
communities to a quality digital education
by 2025 is an example of the critical role
played by the private sector and has so far
benefited close to 130,000 refugee and
host community students.
Addressing displacement and host
communities through 17 projects in 2021
with a budget of $50 million, the UN
Secretary-General’s Peacebuilding Fund
is another a promising practice enhancing
cooperation between humanitarian,
development and peace actors. In Darfur,
for example, UNHCR works jointly with
UNDP and UN-Habitat to resolve land
disputes, access to resources and land
being critical to peace and harmony.

by refugee-led organizations (RLOs) in
response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Strategic partnerships

UNHCR’s partnerships were aligned with
its Strategic Directions and designed to
strengthen engagement with actors to
advance the localization agenda, reach
new audiences and shift the focus of
development cooperation from a purely
humanitarian response to one that fosters
inclusion and solutions.

Inter-agency engagement and
United Nations partnerships
UNHCR worked with UN agencies to
leverage complementarity and expertise
to benefit people of concern. Collaboration
with UNICEF on the “Blueprint for Joint
Action” reached some 10 million refugees
and host communities with programming
and services in education, child protection
and water, sanitation and hygiene. The
main aim of the partnership is to ensure
further the inclusion of refugees in
national systems, but also to ensure more
predictable coordination at the outset of
an emergency. The UNHCR-WFP Joint
Programme Excellence and Targeting
Hub supported targeting and prioritization
of food and basic needs assistance to
refugees. UNHCR’s agreement with the
International Telecommunication Union
enhanced connectivity for people of
concern and host communities and reached
marginalized groups such as persons with

64 UNHCR GLOBAL REPORT 2021

disabilities. Building on the December 2020
letter issued by UNHCR and UN-Women,
a joint regional action plan was developed
with specific activities to advance gender
equality in Bangladesh, Malaysia and
Pakistan. UNHCR, WHO and GAVI, the
Vaccine Alliance, drove vaccine equity
with delivery of vaccines for displaced
populations and host communities, and
supported health systems.
UNHCR engaged with the High-Level Panel
on Internal Displacement and contributed to
the conceptualization of the UN SecretaryGeneral’s Common Agenda as well as his
Action Plan for IDPs (see the section on
UNHCR’s strengthened engagement in
IDP situations). Under the IASC, UNHCR led
work on accountability and inclusion and
spearheaded guidance on localization with
the Somalia NGO consortia. Achievements
included expanded membership to local
and national NGOs, establishment of a
localization repository as well as a “go-to”
platform for accountability and inclusion
guidance and best practices.

Engagement with NGOs and
civil society
NGO consultations in all regions focused
on localization, community engagement
and climate action. At Headquarters level,

Towards the localization agenda, UNHCR
awarded seven RLOs for their innovation,
and a simplified small-grant partnership
arrangement was piloted, enabling direct
support to community-led organizations.
Collaboration was strengthened with
faith-based organizations, for example
with the multi-religious council of leaders,
Religions for Peace. UNHCR also entered
new memoranda of understanding with the
Lutheran World Federation, Community of
Sant’Egidio, Miles4Migrants, Powercoders,
the Scalabrini International Migration
Network, academia, cities and municipalities.
To reach new audiences and different
segments of civil society, UNHCR leveraged
the power of sport to show refugees as
resilient and to combat negative stereotyping.
UNHCR’s partnership with the International
Olympic Committee and Olympic Refugee
Foundation facilitated refugees’ access to
sport at amateur and elite level and generated
impressive press and social media coverage.
The 2021 Tokyo Olympics generated
9.9 million pieces of media coverage and
162 million tweets, of which 10% and 12%
respectively highlighted refugees as resilient
and capable sportsmen and women.

Handbook for Resident Coordinators on
the humanitarian system. In October 2021,
UNHCR and DCO also signed a joint letter
addressed to all Resident Coordinators and
UNHCR Representatives outlining common
areas of work. An analysis by OCHA,
DCO and UNHCR showed that 86% of
UN Sustainable Development Cooperation
Frameworks in refugee-hosting countries
mentioned refugees in their outcome
statements. Financially, UNHCR supported
the Resident Coordinator system with
$2.5 million through the UN cost-sharing
agreement.
At regional level, UNHCR co-led platforms
set up under the UNDS reform, including
Issue-based Coalitions, which furthered
achievement of the SDGs though data and
analysis, and technical and capacity support
to local and government actors.
UNHCR adhered to the OECD DAC
recommendation on the humanitariandevelopment-peacemaking nexus and
continued to be an active member of the
IASC results group on the nexus.

UNHCR’s collaboration with the World Bank
brought additional development funding
to refugee-hosting countries. UNHCR
provided the World Bank with regular
protection assessments, including
comprehensive and publicly available
country refugee policy reviews, enabling
support to be directed to refugee-hosting
countries for the benefit of both refugee
and host communities. Engagement with
regional multilateral development banks
was also strengthened, for example through

People
Management & HR

A new “Strategic workforce planning
approach”, piloted with risk management
colleagues, refined the way in which
support, guidance and analysis is provided
to country operations, bureaux and
Headquarters. At the heart of this new
approach is HR action planning, which
was piloted with the Enterprise Risk
Management function in support of its
2025 Risk Strategy. 45 human resources
staff attended workforce planning training
courses, and colleagues in 11 operations
and two divisions were trained on workforce
dashboards, generating strategic data and
insights on the makeup of the workforce to
inform operational and strategic workforce
planning decisions. 
Strategic workforce planning was
enhanced further by the development of
Workday@UNHCR, as part of the Business
Transformation Programme, which will
provide decision-makers with real-time data
on skills, talent and profiles, and forecast
talent gaps. 
Learning and development became more
strategically linked to integrated talent
management, with linkages between
performance, workforce planning,
leadership and career development.
Self-study modules were made more
interactive and continuous learning was
increased by developing micro-resources
to be used in the flow of work as required.  

66 UNHCR GLOBAL REPORT 2021

A review of the way UNHCR manages
performance – including culture
and processes around performance
management – was undertaken by the
Global Development and Learning Centre.
A new system, pilot tested in 2021, aims
to be simple and efficient, providing a
positive employee experience and further
developing a culture that allows colleagues
to thrive and grow. The new approach
enhances managers’ ability to provide
coaching and feedback and identify career
and development opportunities. 
Various virtual learning and development
platforms were launched, including
GetAbstract, MysteryCoffee and Coursera,
and UNHCR invested in strengthening its
coaching and mentoring culture. Externally
recruited senior colleagues at P5 and
D1 levels received individualized coaching,
mentoring and learning opportunities
through the Orientation/Induction
Programme for Senior Leaders. 
UNHCR provided training in specific
thematic areas, such as a webinar series on
“Leading Racism Awareness Dialogues” for
managers and supervisors, in collaboration
with the Senior Inclusion and Diversity
Adviser. 
While 2021 continued to be marked by the
pandemic, the Joint Review Board met
virtually, providing a key oversight measure
to ensure UNHCR’s recruitment process
is transparent, strategic and free from
bias and discrimination. UNHCR received
92,000 applications for 1,681 advertised
jobs, two thirds of them from external
candidates. With a surge in the number
of emergencies, UNHCR significantly
increased fast-track hiring, with 12 rounds
of advertisements for 270 posts. UNHCR’s
33 talent pools averaged 1,300 applications
a month, helping to meet recruitment
needs, especially for temporary
assignments. 45% of final candidates were
women, and the largest geographical
source of candidates was Africa (35%). 

UNHCR significantly scaled up global

profiles such as women, less-represented
nationalities, and persons with a disability.
Extensive work was done to finalize
recruitment, assignment and flexible UN Reform
work policies, which all offer opportunities
to improve geographical diversity and
gender parity. To remove barriers and
take into consideration circumstances
and challenges faced in particular by
LGBTIQ+ colleagues, an Administrative
Instruction on Payment in Lieu of Family
Installation was revised to include all
“family” duty stations where eligible
dependents have difficulty obtaining
residency status.  
UNHCR played a leading role in interagency efforts on health and safety matters,
actively contributing to the UN SystemWide Task Force on Medical Evacuations,
the inter-agency efforts to strengthen the
medical first line of defence, and the UN
vaccination strategy. UNHCR issued a new
“Policy on managing occupational health
and safety”, providing a solid framework
for dealing with threats, injuries and illness
affecting personnel – both in relation to
COVID-19 concerns and beyond – and
developed a digital system for incident
reporting. A network of occupational
health and safety focal points and
committees maintained a regional and
local overview on how standards are
applied, and 60 senior staff were trained on
managing occupational health and safety
at the workplace. Under the Occupational
Health and Safety Framework, UNHCR
guesthouses are monitored and supported,
providing guidelines for the health and
safety standards to be adhered to by
accommodation providers.

3-to-5-year period which are linked to a
global results framework. Longer-term
thinking and strategic prioritization with
diverse stakeholders allow UNHCR to
better respond to forced displacement
and resolve statelessness, and to embed
the Sustainable Development Goals in
the Office’s work. Displaced and stateless
people, governments, other humanitarian
and development organizations, civil society
groups, the private sector and others are
engaged throughout the process to maximize
positive results for people of concern.
In 2021, the first 24 UNHCR operations
created their multi-year strategies.

The COMPASS approach to RBM is founded
on a collaborative and evidence-based
approach to planning and monitoring results.
Multi-year strategies are informed by a
situation analysis of the context, populations
of concern to UNHCR, and protection and
solutions. The analysis is conducted in
collaboration with relevant stakeholders,
including displaced and stateless people and
UNHCR’s partner organizations. This evidence
base lays the foundation for joint prioritization
and development of the strategic direction for
the coming years and can contribute to other
planning frameworks in the same context.
UNHCR and its partners monitor progress
towards planned results and report against
core indicators. Monitoring findings and
analysis of progress made is used to adjust
implementation plans, as needed.
The system successfully went live for the
2022 Global Appeal, which was issued in
December 2021. At the same time, Global
Focus, UNHCR’s main operational reporting
website for donors, was also relaunched
with an entirely new configuration that
reflected the new results framework.

Risk management helps
UNHCR to think ahead,
prevent problems, seize opportunities
and act with integrity. Building on the
substantial progress made in coping with
operational uncertainty and guided by the
“Risk Management 2025” strategy, the
High Commissioner called for a sustained,
strong risk management culture. With a
model of behavioural change, the strategy
will advance risk management across the
organization with the support of senior
leadership and a network of 30 risk
practitioners.  
 
Embedding a risk management culture
means that personnel working directly
with displaced communities can spot
risks and take action. In Uganda, which
hosts the largest number of refugees in
Africa, UNHCR field offices and sub-offices
have appointed risk focal points, while

the country-level Uganda Risk Advisory
Group, including donors and partners,
tackles risks such as impunity for highlevel perpetrators of sexual exploitation
and abuse. In Rwanda, all field offices
are involved in reviewing risks, so those
closest to the point of delivery help shape
decision-making. In South Sudan, detailed
action plans for each identified risk ensure
proactive risk management. In Kenya’s
Kakuma and Dadaab refugee camps, annual
fraud vulnerability assessments support
the integrity of protection processes
such as refugee status determination and
resettlement. Embedding risk management
across operations strengthens UNHCR’s
programmes and accountability. 
The risk network trained and provided
in-person and online support to
5,081 personnel from UNHCR and its
partners, nearly double the number in 2020,
with a focus on integrity-related risks such
as abuse of authority, fraud, corruption,
and sexual exploitation and abuse.

Partner staff in Somalia, South Sudan and
Uganda received general risk management
training. Fraud prevention training took
place in Bangladesh, the Democratic
Republic of the Congo, Indonesia, Pakistan
and Yemen, and partners across the Asia
and the Pacific region were engaged on this
important topic. Integrity support missions
and risk assessments were undertaken
in Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Chad and
Niger. Code of Conduct dialogues were
used in Libya to engage with UNHCR and
partners on the ethical use of social media,
procurement integrity, fraud and corruption
prevention or conflict of interest. Protection
risks to the Refugee Olympic Team
were collectively reviewed by the Division
of International Protection, the Asia and
the Pacific Regional Bureau and the
Japan operation.  
Senior leaders were coached in
reputational risk management and crisis
communications, and how their actions

could affect people’s safety and the trust
placed in UNHCR by refugees. A real-time
crisis leadership simulation provided handson experience.  
Throughout 2021, the pandemic remained
a significant source of uncertainty for the
health of people of concern and UNHCR
personnel across operations. While the
risks have been managed proactively, the
long-term socioeconomic impact of the
pandemic on the livelihoods of displaced
communities and on the protection
environment affects people forced to flee
across the globe.  
As the number of people who depend on
UNHCR’s support continues to rise due to
new crises, extreme weather events and
conflict, UNHCR must continue to take
and manage the risks required to deliver
its mandate consistently, consciously and
collectively.

Afghanistan – risk management in action 
During 2021, conflict and political turmoil in Afghanistan exacerbated humanitarian needs. Despite a
highly volatile context, UNHCR stayed and delivered to meet the needs of hundreds of thousands of
Afghans who had been forced to flee. The Taliban’s return to power and a collapsing banking system led
to significant risks and recalibration of its plans. In close coordination with the Afghanistan UN Country
Team, UNHCR continuously evaluated the risks for displaced communities, its humanitarian programmes,
and UNHCR and partner personnel. UN Security Council Resolution 2615 (2021) was important in
enabling the provision of humanitarian aid to Afghanistan, by exempting humanitarian activities to meet
basic needs from Taliban-related sanctions. Yet, as UNHCR navigated the new political landscape and
engaged with new partners and de facto authorities to ensure it could continue to deliver to people in
need, UNHCR systematically checked individuals and entities against the UN Sanctions List.
Direct financial assistance was assessed as one of the best ways of supporting Afghans who had fled
their homes, to boost protection, shelter needs and food security, and support returns to places of origin
when security allowed. One crucial area where UNHCR was able to intervene was in partnership with
financial service providers, to set up a cash assistance programme. To tackle the risks in implementing
the programme in a situation where partners on the ground were scarce and identifying the most
vulnerable individuals was challenging, UNHCR employed strict due diligence in selecting partners.
Mitigation actions also included distributing cash in both dollars and afghanis, enhanced post-distribution
monitoring, and biometric registration with fingerprints and eye scans.

Integrity and oversight
As UNHCR continued its internal
transformation, and as it dealt with
the challenges of rising numbers of
emergencies and the ongoing impact of the
pandemic, the activities of the Inspector
General’s Office (IGO) were at the core
of independent oversight, with its overall
objective the effectiveness of UNHCR’s
independent oversight system. 
Despite 2021 being another year of the
pandemic, the IGO made steady progress
implementing its five-year strategy.
2021 saw strengthened consultation
and positive engagement amongst
independent oversight providers and with
UNHCR management in the identification,
assessment and addressing of key risks,
issues and challenges facing UNHCR.
Broadly, independent oversight findings
during the year confirmed UNHCR
maintained satisfactory management
oversight over operations despite
the challenges of a record number of
emergency declarations and the impact
of COVID-19.
There was an increase of 27% in complaints
received to 1,450 (in 2020 there were 1,146),
with the IGO stepping up the numbers and

efficiency of complaints assessed through
its intake processes in response. In 2021,
there was a 42% increase of cases assessed
(1,613) mainly due to steps to improve the
efficiency and effectiveness of procedures
to handle increasing numbers of complaints.
Of the total number of assessments,
44% required no further action and were
closed after intake review (2020: 37%);
38% referred (2020: 43%); 8% resulted in
investigations (2020: 13%); 3% closed after
assessment (2020: 1%): and the remaining
7% were referred to implementing partners
for potential investigative follow up.
121 investigations were opened in 2021
(2020: 142). 158 investigations were finalized,
an increase of 22% compared to 2020.
Of these, 50% were substantiated
(in 2020 this was 55%).
There was also effective coordination of
independent oversight work, with two
online platforms established presenting
consolidated views of oversight workplans
and recommendations. These provided
management with an overview of oversight
plans and results at organizational level,
as well as supporting analysis and detail.
A real and engaged dialogue amongst
independent oversight providers was
developed in 2021 which helped to ensure
a coherent oversight workplan for 2022.

Prevention of sexual
exploitation and abuse and
sexual harassment in 2021

Cabo Delgado, northern Mozambique.

The fight against sexual exploitation and
abuse and sexual harassment is critical
to delivering protection and assistance
in a safe and dignified manner, for both
people of concern and those with whom
UNHCR works. In 2021, the Office’s efforts
focused on enhancing learning and
strengthening the capacity of personnel to
tackle sexual misconduct, operationalizing
a victim-centred approach and addressing
underlying causes of sexual misconduct
rooted in organizational culture.
Given global COVID-19 restrictions, UNHCR
adapted learning activities for virtual
delivery, engaging over 600 UNHCR
personnel. Two internal UNHCR learning
packages were finalized, one on sexual
exploitation and abuse and one on sexual
harassment. Using videos, case studies,
and testimonies for experiential learning,
these interactive packages aim to enhance
the capacity of personnel to define, detect,
prevent and respond to sexual misconduct.
By the end of 2021, 40 UNHCR personnel
from 25 operations and Headquarters had
been trained as facilitators on the learning

packages. In addition, an innovative
participatory webinar based on a video
case study was used to engage 119 staff
– field-based focal points on protection
from sexual exploitation and abuse – in
14 different peer-to-peer learning exchange
sessions to explore key concepts, standards
and best practices. These focal points were
drawn from 89 operations across UNHCR’s
seven regions.
Following the adoption in 2020 of the
“Policy on a victim-centred approach in
UNHCR’s response to sexual misconduct”,
the first of its kind in the UN system,
consultations were held across UNHCR on
putting the policy into operation, including
with field colleagues who provide support
to victims of sexual exploitation and abuse,
as well as relevant entities at Headquarters.
Virtual workshops identified concrete steps
to integrate the policy’s key principles
into standard operating procedures. To
strengthen support to victims of sexual
misconduct and enhance the integration
of prevention and response to sexual
harassment within the organization, the

Coordinator on PSEA and SH, with
enhanced responsibilities, although still with
a strong focus on assisting victims of sexual

and resolution.
In a systemic commitment to rooting out
underlying causes of sexual misconduct,
UNHCR produced “A selection of
promising practices on organizational
culture change”, a collection of innovative
and practical initiatives from a range
of humanitarian and development
organizations. To further support
addressing workplace culture issues,
UNHCR developed a “Facilitators’ guide
for a session on values, attitudes and
organizational culture in relation to
prevention of sexual misconduct”. This
guide supports organizations and teams
in holding reflective sessions that provide
a safe space for senior leaders to reflect
and engage on the issues that lie at the
root of sexual misconduct, including
underlying issues of power imbalance
and gender inequality, and on their role in
changing behaviour.

Building on one such session that was held
at the end of 2020 for members of the Chief
Executives Board Task Force on Addressing
Sexual Harassment within the Organizations
of the UN system, UNHCR facilitated a
session with IASC Principals and two
sessions with Humanitarian Coordinators
from across the world.
To reiterate its commitment to addressing
sexual misconduct, UNHCR was among
the first UN agencies to adhere to the
OECD’s “DAC recommendations on
ending sexual exploitation, abuse and
harassment in development co-operation
and humanitarian assistance”.
UNHCR was also the first UN agency to
pilot the Misconduct Disclosure Scheme,
a tool for vetting and reference checking on
NGO partner personnel, and a complement
to the UN ClearCheck database in which
UNHCR participates.

Responding to situations
of internal displacement
© UNHCR

Internally displaced people in Hsipaw, Shan state, Myanmar, receive essential core relief items from UNHCR and local partners.

The growing numbers of internally
displaced people, especially due to
conflict and violence, have led UNHCR
to engage more systematically. The
internally displaced are the largest group
of people of concern to UNHCR: there
were 51.3 million recorded IDPs at the end
of 2021, 2.7 million more than at the end
of 2020. Although access to IDPs is often
hindered, making it difficult to assess and
meet their needs, UNHCR was actively
engaged and for its internal step-up
declared 11 new IDP emergencies in
eight countries including Afghanistan,
the Democratic Republic of the Congo,
Ethiopia and Myanmar.In addition to
providing humanitarian response through
its operations and leadership of the three
clusters (Protection, Shelter and CCCM),
UNHCR enhanced its engagement
with development stakeholders, drawing
attention to social protection needs
and potential solutions that may be
accessible through early State-supported
development interventions. 

In Ethiopia, coordinating with partners
and the authorities, UNHCR expanded
its programme to cover nine regions,
reaching over 1.7 million people directly
with protection services, shelter and core
relief support. Of those, over 1 million
people were reached with protection
activities, including activities that
support IDPs’ solution-related decisions.
Additionally, UNHCR’s CCCM role
supported 580,000 IDPs in communal
settings, the majority in 68 sites in
Amhara and Tigray regions. Elsewhere
in the East and Horn of Africa and Great
Lakes, ongoing and escalating conflicts in
Darfur, Sudan, required UNHCR to focus
on life-saving activities including through
remote protection monitoring and direct
interventions. Under the Solutions Initiative
for Sudan and South Sudan, UNHCR

advance frameworks for comprehensive
solutions for refugees, IDPs and returnees.

catalysing investments in medium- to longterm development and peace interventions,
called “Pockets of hope,” which will be
piloted in 2022.  
In Southern Africa, community-based
protection staff helped strengthen feedback
mechanisms, protection and participation
in the Democratic Republic of the Congo,
where armed conflict and violence triggered
vast and repeated displacement, worsened
with the eruption of Mount Nyiragongo.
This approach helped address the needs
of IDPs living in planned sites and those
sheltered with host families. In Mozambique,
UNHCR responded to large-scale internal
displacement due to attacks by armed
groups in the Cabo Delgado province and
natural disasters such as cyclones. UNHCR
supported the Africa Development Bank’s
large-scale development projects, also
facilitating private sector development and
IDPs’ access to electricity and agricultural
production. UNHCR strengthened
partnership with the German Development
Cooperation to support IDPs in northern
Mozambique. 
In West and Central Africa, UNHCR
promoted and supported States for
the domestication of the African Union
Convention for the Protection and
Assistance of Internally Displaced People
in Africa. In 2021, a draft bill was adopted
at technical level in Cameroon and Chad,
and the Central African Republic’s draft bill
was introduced in Parliament for adoption.
In Burkina Faso, support was provided
for the establishment and training of the
Inter-ministerial Technical Committee and
a roadmap for domestication adopted.
In Nigeria, a federal IDP policy was adopted.
In Mali, the draft bill validated at technical
level in 2019 was reviewed. 
In the Americas, UNHCR worked with
national and state-departmental authorities,
parliaments and local governments
to promote institutional frameworks
and policies on internal displacement,
with legislative initiatives underway

OVERVIEW I GLOBAL INITIATIVES

in El Salvador, Honduras and Mexico.
Initiatives included the adoption and/or
implementation of IDP legislation, policies,
protection and assistance programmes.
These included a framework to protect
housing, land and property rights and
the recovery of physical and community
assets. UNHCR worked with national
authorities in developing national statistics
and information on IDPs in line with the
international recommendations on IDP
statistics to better inform future strategies
and interventions for people displaced
by violence. UNHCR expanded its
community-based protection initiatives in
host communities or people at heightened
risk of displacement. In collaboration
with grassroot organizations, the Office
supported interventions to mitigate risks
and strengthen protection networks
through the rehabilitation of communal
areas and programmes that promote
community organization and expand
alternatives for groups at heightened risk
in northern Central America. Colombia’s
Victims’ Unit and UNHCR undertook to
improve data on IDPs’ vulnerability levels
and linkages with solutions.   
In Asia and the Pacific, 571,000 new
conflict-induced IDPs took Afghanistan’s
total to around 3.5 million by the
end of the year, although another
791,000 returned, mostly in the latter
part of 2021. Anticipating an escalation in
displacement, UNHCR had made extensive
contingency and preparedness planning,
increasing emergency shelter materials
and personal protective equipment to
also ensure a COVID-19-safe response.
UNHCR stayed to assist 1.1 million IDPs,
providing core relief items, emergency
shelter, hygiene and dignity kits, cash
assistance and winterization support.
UNHCR prioritized the delivery of lifesaving humanitarian assistance, ensuring
continuity of protection for IDPs and
building resilient communities in line with
the Solutions Strategy for Afghan Refugees
(SSAR). In Myanmar, 320,900 people
were displaced following the military

takeover on 1 February 2021, bringing the
IDP population to 671,000. UNHCR and
partners worked to reach vulnerable IDPs,
including 130,000 displaced in Rakhine
state since 2012. 62,000 affected people in
Rakhine state received core relief items and
emergency shelter support from UNHCR.
Quick impact projects implemented by
UNHCR and UNDP benefited more than
20,000 people. In the Philippines, UNHCR
built the capacity of local and national
authorities to support their leadership of
current and future responses to internal
displacement and, in December, deployed
staff and core relief items to Caraga
following Typhoon Rai. 
In Europe, UNHCR coordinated protection
and shelter in eastern Ukraine and
operated on both sides of the contact
line, undertaking shelter repairs and
community projects for basic services in
isolated areas. UNHCR assisted affected
populations in Government-controlled
areas with cash, legal aid and services for
persons with specific needs. UNHCR also
provided logistical support to humanitarian
convoys on behalf of the United Nations
Humanitarian Country Team. 
In the Middle East and North Africa,
UNHCR carried out a participatory
assessment in Iraq, covering
documentation, child protection, genderbased violence, livelihoods, self-reliance
and mental health. UNHCR advocated
inclusion and employment opportunities
after the sudden closure of 3 IDP sites
and supported legal assistance and
institutional capacity-building to help
secure civil documentation. Similar
support for documentation was offered
in Yemen, along with legal assistance and
psychosocial support. UNHCR carried
out more than 230,000 protection
monitoring assessments, supported
some 138,000 IDPs through protection
interventions, including legal assistance
and psychosocial support, and distributed
$72 million in cash assistance to help
1.4 million IDPs stave off famine.

In the north-western Syrian Arab Republic,
275,000 people received a COVID-19
vaccination and 547,000 IDPs received
core relief items. Through partners,
UNHCR provided psychosocial support
to 203,000 people, and the Safe from the
Start initiative helped fund gender-based
violence prevention, risk mitigation
and response. 

Coordination 
Globally, UNHCR drove efforts ensuring that
protecting the internally displaced remained
at the centre of international and national
action, for humanitarian, development and
peace actors. In 2021, together with the
Special Rapporteur on the human rights of
IDPs, UNHCR established the IDP Protection
Expert Group. Comprising the current and
former mandate holders on the human
rights of IDPs, as well as senior-level
thought leaders, former UN Resident and
Humanitarian Coordinators and policy
experts, the IDP Protection Expert Group
aims to enable political will and national
leadership through senior-level international
support for strengthened protection
responses to address internal displacement.
Fostering the legal and policy environment
for the protection of IDPs remained a
strategic focus for UNHCR, including
through maintaining a global database of
IDP law and policy as well as collaboration
with the African Union on the Kampala
Convention. 
UNHCR remains a keen partner in UN and
State-led initiatives to support solutions,
with continued support to the UN 
Secretary-General’s High-Level Panel on
Internal Displacement and its subsequent
follow up with the Secretary-General’s
Action Agenda on Internal Displacement.
As a Core Steering Group agency, it is
committed to contributing to solutions for
IDPs in close partnership with affected
States, especially drawing on its “refugee
solutions” related experience to the
IDP context. These include facilitation
of development financing approaches,

OVERVIEW I GLOBAL INITIATIVES

consultations with IDP communities,
supporting inclusion of socioeconomic
considerations in IDP data, and others – all
aimed towards ensuring IDP protection in
the context of durable solutions.   
The globally recognized GP20 Plan of
Action was succeeded by the GP2.0
Global Platform on Internal Displacement,
co-hosted by UNHCR, as an informal
platform for joint initiatives and sharing
good practices. The work of the UNHCRWorld Bank Joint Data Center on Forced
Displacement also enhances the ability of
stakeholders to make timely and evidencebased decisions to improve the lives of
people impacted by forced displacement,
including IDPs. 

Global Protection Cluster 
In 2021, the Global Protection Cluster
(GPC) and 32 national protection clusters
– 29 of which were led by UNHCR –
advocated for the rights of 113 million
people in need of protection, and delivered
services to 23 million people such as
legal aid, psychosocial support and case
management, responses on issues of child
protection and gender-based violence.  
Field support was a significant element of
the GPC’s work. Its multi-agency Operations
Cell and Task Teams provided support on
themes such as disability inclusion, age
appropriate services, trafficking, mental
health and psychosocial support, climate
impact, human rights, cash for protection,
protection advocacy, law and policy, the
Humanitarian Programme Cycle, and
protection coordination. Missions were
undertaken to Burkina Faso, Cameroon,
Colombia, the DRC, Ethiopia, Mozambique,
Niger and Sudan, and remote support was
provided to Afghanistan and the Bolivarian
Republic of Venezuela. The GPC activated
an Emergency Support Cell for Afghanistan,
to assist with field coordination, timely
advocacy and evidence-based analysis
amidst a challenging operational
environment.  
76 UNHCR GLOBAL REPORT 2021

OVERVIEW I GLOBAL INITIATIVES

The GPC defined a field minimum
operational footprint, a collective Protection
Analytical Framework that enables
coherent analysis, and continued issuing
flagship reports such as the Centrality
of Protection Review, Global Protection
Updates, and Protection Funding Review. 
The GPC continued supporting operations
in their advocacy with authorities,
agencies, and humanitarian country teams
while amplifying frontline perspectives
at global levels. Such efforts included a
Global Protection Forum which brought
together over 5,000 humanitarian, peace
and development partners, and briefings
to Member States and donors. Through its
active presence in all IASC Results Groups,
the GPC backed the elevation of protection
efforts across the humanitarian system
and continued to mobilize partners to
engage on the centrality of protection,
particularly through the IASC Protection
Policy Review.  

Global CCCM Cluster 
Ongoing conflict and recurring
displacement meant the most vulnerable
IDPs found themselves living in undignified,
substandard spontaneous sites and camplike settings in 2021. If not addressed
through CCCM activities, insufficient and
irregular access to services in sites risks
further aggravating these situations and
affecting people’s lives. Over 12 million
people were targeted through Humanitarian
Response Plans by CCCM clusters and
cluster-like partners in 22 operations with,
overall, UNHCR leading and co-leading
18. 107 international and 117 national
cluster partners formed CCCM clusters
in 13 operations where the cluster was
activated, and 22 CCCM coordination
platforms were active throughout 2021,
of which 14 were officially activated
CCCM clusters and 8 were cluster-like
coordination mechanisms. Two new
clusters (Burkina Faso and Ethiopia)
and one working group (Afghanistan)
were activated.  

At the global level, 715 representatives
from 66 national and international
organizations participated in the UNHCRorganized annual retreat, with the launch
of an updated Global CCCM Cluster
strategy and new minimum standards in
camp management. The retreat helped
to reinvigorate the Global Cluster, coled with IOM, after a challenging period
of unprecedented displacement and the
COVID-19 pandemic.  
243 mission days in support of country
clusters were provided by the UNHCR
Global CCCM Cluster team on issues
ranging from strategy development,
technical support, development of terms
of reference, recruitment, capacity
building and information management.
A partnership with the London School
of Economics to review environmentally
friendly and sustainable CCCM best
practices was established, and the Cluster
collected and published case studies
on 13 thematic areas including durable
solutions and localization. To improve
CCCM coordination , an update of the
CCCM Cluster Coordination Toolkit was
initiated and the “Minimum standards for
camp management” policy was launched.
The Global Area-based Approach working
group published a position paper outlining
the Cluster’s position on area-based
approaches. 

repurposing options, sustainable energy
solutions, development of country level
environmental profiles, localized marketbased interventions and the piloting of
innovative and more environmentally
sustainable shelter solutions.  
In order to improve the Cluster’s information
management capacity, the GSC developed
and launched its Information Management
& Assessment Toolkit to complement
its Coordination Toolkit. In June 2021,
the GSC hosted the 2021 annual meeting
online, under the theme of “Shelter in a
Changing Environment” with 26 events and
1,433 participants. In October, the annual
Coordination Workshop was held with
multiple online events. In June 2021,
the GSC launched the 8th edition of the
GSC Shelter Projects publication.  
During the second half of 2021, a new
gender-based violence focal point joined
the team (a resource shared with the
Global CCCM Cluster) to provide support
and guidance. Towards the end of 2021,
the GSC team increased its capacity with
advocacy and research focal points. In
addition, a roving cluster coordinator and
a roving information management officer
also joined the GSC and, overall, support
(missions and remote support) to field
clusters totalled 774 days. 

Global Shelter Cluster  
In 2021, UNHCR led 16 out of 31 formally
activated shelter clusters and 19 cluster
or cluster-like mechanisms. The UNHCRled shelter clusters provided shelter and
core relief items to over 10.6 million IDPs
through 470 partners in conflict situations,
representing 54% of all IDPs assisted
with shelter and core relief items globally.
Earmarked support also allowed the Global
Shelter Cluster (GSC) to mobilize collective
efforts towards greener and climatesmart humanitarian shelter and settlement
responses. This is done through changes in
specifications, support with recycling and

centres; reforestation in Bangladesh
around the Rohingya camps; and solarizing
water systems to provide more water to
communities for longer periods. UNHCR
has undertaken such efforts in 20 countries,
providing water to over 800,000 refugees.
However, unprecedented challenges and
hazardous weather events are limiting
communities’ capacity to recover and thrive.
Increased preparedness is needed to help
displaced people remain resilient in the face
of climate change. 

Climate action

The signs of drought are everywhere in the arid landscape of Helmand Province and prospects are grim for farmers. Many are already on the move, no longer
fleeing war, but the combined effects of climate change and economic collapse.

In 2021, a sobering pattern came into ever
sharper relief: the interconnectedness of
climate change, poverty, food insecurity,
conflict and displacement. More and more
people – invariably those who contribute
least to climate change and are least
equipped to adapt to it – are searching for
safety and security in the face of climaterelated threats. Among many examples in
2021, floods hit South Sudan and Rohingya
refugees, Afghanistan and Somalia
suffered devastating droughts, and
dwindling water resources sparked conflict
in Cameroon. 90% of refugees come from
countries on the frontlines of the climate
emergency. But fleeing is no guarantee
of safety: over 40% of refugees and 70%
of people internally displaced by conflict
live in countries highly vulnerable to
climate change.  
 
UNHCR set out its response to the climate
emergency in a “Strategic framework for

78 UNHCR GLOBAL REPORT 2021

climate action”, with objectives relating to
operations, law and policy, and UNHCR’s
own environmental footprint.  
 

Operations – building resilience
on the frontlines of the climate
emergency 
With displaced people on the frontlines of
the climate crisis, UNHCR aims to mitigate
the adverse impacts of climate change
and environmental degradation on people
of concern. For example, in Tunaydbah
refugee settlement in Sudan, UNHCR and
partners had to evacuate refugees whose
shelters were damaged by heavy rains and
flooding. A topographical survey of the
area was done to better understand which
areas of the settlement were most at risk of
flooding, and so avoid, mitigate and prepare
for such impacts in the future. Other efforts
saw renewable electricity supplied to
Kenyan hospitals and COVID-19 isolation

To fully flesh out its approach to integrating
the strategic framework in its operations,
UNHCR adopted the “Operational strategy
for climate resilience and environmental
sustainability 2022-2025”, focusing on
incorporating environmental considerations
and risks in preparedness activities,
operational responses and supply
management. It aims to decrease the
environmental footprint of displacement
responses while enhancing climate
resilience, particularly in sectors such as
settlement planning, shelter, WASH and
energy. 
Two important innovative initiatives were
launched as part of the strategy: the
Refugee Environmental Protection (REP)
Fund and Project Flow. The REP Fund
is a sustainable financing mechanism

investing in larger-scale refugee and
host community reforestation and clean
cooking programmes, while registering
them as verified carbon credits. In 2021,
four operations expressed their interest in
joining the REP Fund. Project Flow aims to
overcome the obstacle of high capital costs
required to switch from diesel generators
to renewable energy. UNHCR has already
solarized 41% of water pumping systems,
but many upgrades require significant
capital, a problem that Project Flow
solves by recycling fuel cost savings into
a revolving fund. In 2021, six operations
expressed their interest in joining.  
Further guidance on greening operations
was provided by UNHCR’s “Shelter
and sustainability overview” and the
“Protection-sensitive access to clean
cooking compendium”. Given the
manufacturing of core relief items (CRIs)
accounts for a significant percentage of
UNHCR’s greenhouse gas emissions,
UNHCR identified the 10 highest emitting
items delivered to operations and prioritized
their modification to increase environmental
sustainability. UNHCR also outlined the
core supply activities that help improve
the sustainability of the end-to-end supply
chain, including the production modalities
of CRIs and more efficient and leaner
delivery mechanisms.  

In Kenya and the United Republic of Tanzania, solar-powered electricity
allows medical staff to run hospital equipment and laboratory systems 24/7, enables
vaccines to be properly refrigerated, and supports medical diagnosis and treatment
to effectively respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. In the United Republic of Tanzania,
UNHCR is installing solar panels in the main hospital, which provides services to over
135,000 people – about 56% of the total refugee population. In Kenya, UNHCR is
providing solar-powered electricity in hospitals and COVID-19 isolation centres to
address energy shortages and ensure that the centres can be fully operational.

Law and policy – promoting
protection for those forcibly
displaced by the effects of climate
change 
UNHCR continued disseminating its
“Legal considerations regarding claims
for international protection made in the
context of the adverse effects of climate
change and disasters” and providing
guidance to States, legal practitioners and
other actors on related legal questions.
UNHCR also supports governments in the
development of relevant legal and policy
frameworks for the protection of people
displaced in the context of disasters and
climate change, such as Mozambique’s
“Policy and Strategy on Internal
Displacement Management”, which was
adopted in August 2021. 

UNHCR supported research and
co-organized, with the Kaldor Centre for
International Refugee Law and partners,
a workshop series on “Displacement and
migration in the context of disasters and
climate change in Africa”, which yielded a
research agenda developed in cooperation
with academia, researchers and legal
experts. In partnership with the Norwegian
Refugee Council and the Peter McMullin
Centre on Statelessness, UNHCR published
a factsheet on the particular vulnerabilities
stateless people face as a result of climate
change, as well as climate-related risks
of statelessness. 
UNHCR cooperated closely with regional
institutional partners and actively engaged
in global and regional policy discussions. It
supported the Nansen Initiative Protection
Agenda continued as part of the State-led
Platform on Disaster Displacement and,
as a member of the Warsaw International
Mechanism for Loss and Damage’s
Task Force on Displacement under the
UN Framework Convention on Climate
Change, supported Parties’ consideration of
policy and measures to avert, minimize and
address climate-related displacement at
COP26. The High Commissioner implored
States to take action and highlighted the
particular plight of displaced people in a
changing climate.  

Research partnerships for action
In support of the United Nations Integrated Strategy for the Sahel and the
work of the UN Special Coordinator for Development in the Sahel, UNHCR
facilitated an inter-agency predictive analytics project in the Sahel to enhance
coordination on data and strengthen preparedness for the growing and
interconnected risks. It brought together a global consortium of leading academic
institutions working on the nexus between climate change and other mega trends as
contributing factors for new or exacerbated vulnerabilities, food insecurity, conflict
and potential displacement. A synthesis report will be published in 2022.

In order to improve the predictability of
UNHCR’s engagement in emergencies
brought on by climate change and other
natural hazards, UNHCR’s “Policy on
emergency preparedness and response”
was significantly revised. Risk analysis
and preparedness mechanisms and
tools have been reviewed to incorporate
environmental considerations. UNHCR
also developed a “Practical guidance for
UNHCR staff on IDP protection in the
context of disasters and the adverse
effects of climate change”. 

Malian fisherman Yahya Koronio Kona fishes in the waters of Lake Mahmouda in Mauritania. He and his family moved several times inside Mali because
of drying lakes and declining fish stocks, as well as tension with older-established residents. They eventually crossed the border into Mauritania and settled
near Lake Mahmouda.

Greening UNHCR – reducing
UNHCR’s own environmental
footprint 
UNHCR aims to reduce its own environmental
footprint and greenhouse gas emissions
by at least 45% by 2030. In 2021, UNHCR
achieved climate neutrality for the third
year running through offsets and forged
ahead with installing Green Boxes, which
remotely monitor UNHCR offices’ electricity
use through the Internet of Things, with 252
(62%) of the target of 409 installed. UNHCR’s
Green Data project saw an increase in
reporting from 102 to 292 offices (out of
520 in total).  

The Green Financing Facility matured and
now has staff and a process to start to fund
the transition of UNHCR’s infrastructure to
renewable energy sources. UNHCR was
the first UN entity to sign the Climate and
Environment Charter for Humanitarian
Organizations that includes high-level
commitments to guide the sector’s
response to the climate crisis, and best
practice guidelines on how to reduce
UNHCR’s environmental footprint were
published. A Vehicle Tracking System (VTS)
has been installed in 90% of UNHCR’s fleet,
allowing for the use of satellite data tracking
information to calculate emissions.

Staffing was strengthened in Ethiopia and Sudan to
respond to gender-based violence in the northern
Ethiopia emergency. Pandemic-related school
closures added to the risks for children in
emergency situations. UNHCR pushed for the safe
re-opening of schools and minimal school dropouts,
especially for girls, and there was notable progress
in refugees’ and returnees’ inclusion in national
education plans. UNHCR provided $37.9 million in
cash assistance to over 1 million people, mainly via
bank transfers or as mobile money, helping to pay
for energy, shelter, hygiene, livelihoods and
repatriation.

Surafuel Gebrehiwot, 54, was separated from his wife and children as they fled into Sudan to escape fighting in their home region
of Tigray in Ethiopia. UNHCR traced his family to Um Rakuba refugee camp in Sudan.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
By the end of 2021, the East and Horn of Africa and
the Great Lakes region hosted 4.9 million refugees
and asylum seekers, as well as 12 million internally
displaced people. Nearly 200,000 people became
refugees, driven by conflict, drought, flooding, food
shortages, insecurity and localized violence.
2021 saw a widespread relaxation of COVID-19
restrictions, however asylum restrictions remained
in force in some countries and prevented some
asylum requests and registrations from going
ahead. Despite UNHCR’s demarches, incidents of
refoulement also occurred throughout 2021. Some
refugees moved onward, in often risky conditions,
towards the Mediterranean or southern Africa.
Refugee status determination was slow and costly,
with a long-standing backlog of 180,000 asylum
applications pending adjudication. UNHCR
collaborated with the East African Community (EAC),
the International Conference for the Great Lakes
Region (ICGLR), the Intergovernmental Authority

on Development (IGAD) and the African Union
Commission to promote the rights of forcibly
displaced people and access to services and civil
documentation. An EAC/IGAD Regional Protection
Dialogue provided recommendations on nonrefoulement and the right to asylum, as well as
socioeconomic inclusion, solutions and other topics.
Several countries made progress on pledges
relating to statelessness, including Rwanda
which published a new nationality law facilitating
naturalization. UNHCR released a study analysing
risk factors for statelessness in the Horn of Africa
and launched another on the Great Lakes region
with the ICGLR Secretariat.
Underfunding of WFP meant that rations had to be
cut for over 3.5 million refugees in the region, resulting
in reportedly high levels of acute malnutrition,
stunting and anaemia. With conflicts and COVID-19
hindering direct contact, UNHCR employed remote
protection monitoring and interventions and
supported the role of community structures in
tackling child protection and gender-based violence.

UNHCR’s livelihoods strategy in Kenya helped revive
refugee employment and reduce food insecurity.
UNHCR worked with IGAD and other partners under
the Solutions Initiative for Sudan and South Sudan to
advance frameworks for comprehensive solutions,

and both countries adopted national solutions
strategies. UNHCR co-convened the Africa Private
Sector Forum on Forced Displacement, bringing
business leaders and philanthropists from across
Africa to discuss innovative solutions.
Over 270,000 South Sudanese spontaneously
returned, and UNHCR facilitated voluntary
repatriation for 66,000 Burundian refugees.
UNHCR facilitated returns for over 2,700 Somalis
and 2,000 Rwandans, whilst over 1,000 refugees
returned to Ethiopia. Resettlement was slowed by
insecurity and political instability in Ethiopia and
Sudan, camp consolidation in Rwanda and the United
Republic of Tanzania, and by COVID-19. Nevertheless,
several operations resumed in-person resettlement
interviews, and submissions were made for 73% of
around 22,500 resettlement places. 9,600 refugees
departed for resettlement, twice the 2020 number.

Impact of the Global Compact on Refugees
Out of over 600 pledges with potential relevance to the region, 257 specifically targeted at least one
host country from the region, mostly in education (25%), statelessness (20%) and jobs and livelihoods
(16%). Updates on the implementation of almost 150 of the 257 pledges had been recorded by year
end. 83% of the pledges were in progress, while 18 had been fulfilled. Interest in progress on pledges
was evident from the Regional Economic Inclusion Working Group, where UNHCR and NRC co-hosted
representatives of 66 INGOs, UN agencies, International Financial Institutions, research institutes and
other organizations, with over 300 members in all.
Among the pledges, Ethiopia’s jobs and livelihoods pledge was supported by agriculture and livestock
projects worth $88.5 million, backed by partners such as the IKEA Foundation, GIZ, Good Neighbors
Ethiopia, UNCDF and WFP. The Government of Denmark supported Rwanda’s jobs and livelihoods
pledge, committing to provide $1.6 million for agricultural projects benefiting 1,883 refugee and host
community households. The Government of Denmark and the LEGO Foundation both supported
Uganda’s Education Response Plan, while the European Union launched an $11 million environmental
response to match Uganda’s pledge on natural resources. The Republic of Korea provided a multi-year
$5 million contribution to Uganda’s refugee response and was a contributor to the Country-Based
Pooled Funds to help Sudan and Ethiopia, among other countries.

REGIONAL SUMMARIES I EAST AND HORN OF AFRICA AND THE GREAT LAKES

FINANCIAL INFORMATION
Consequences of underfunding
UNHCR’s regional budget of $1.9 billion was
only 51% funded by the end of the year. Funding
shortfalls to WFP reduced food aid to 3.5 million
refugees, primarily in Burundi, Djibouti, Ethiopia,
Kenya, Rwanda, South Sudan, Uganda and the
United Republic of Tanzania, leading to high levels
of acute malnutrition, stunting, anaemia and critical
protection concerns.
The pandemic prompted some donors to reduce
funding for UNHCR in Kenya, or to earmark funds
more tightly. UNHCR could not meet some supply
chain and partner costs, undermining basic services
and protection work. In Sudan, funds to construct
school infrastructure and furniture in refugee-hosting
locations were lacking, and more than 3.1 million
children needed financial support for their formal
education, including over 2 million host community
residents, 617,000 IDPs, 241,000 refugees and
166,000 returnees. Around 70% of refugee children
of primary school age and 90% of secondary school
age were not receiving any formal education, with
South Sudanese refugees particularly affected.

REGIONAL SUMMARIES I EAST AND HORN OF AFRICA AND THE GREAT LAKES

In the United Republic of Tanzania, underfunding
meant UNHCR and partners could not provide
supplementary feeding to some persons with
specific needs and vulnerable children above
the age of 2. 27% of people of concern in the
United Republic of Tanzania’s refugee camps
endured unacceptable living conditions, living in
dilapidated emergency shelters and tents for
a prolonged period.

THE GREAT LAKES | USD

OPERATION

A lack of reintegration opportunities for returning
Burundian refugees prompted some to move
onwards within Burundi or to other countries, or
to go back to their country of asylum in search of
education or social services.

Underfunding meant refugees in Uganda lacked
water supplies. 72,000 Burundian refugees received
only 14.2 litres of water per person per day, barely
two thirds of the minimum standard. UNHCR also
faced challenges in providing sufficient water for
905,000 South Sudanese refugees spread over
several settlements in Uganda. Additional funding
would have ensured that SPHERE standards were
met, which in turn would have reduced protection
risks for women walking long distances to
fetch water.

The Vos family’s generous multi-year contribution to
secondary education in Uganda is enabling thousands of refugee
children to pursue their secondary education and fulfil their
potential. Despite the closures of educational institutions during
the COVID-19 pandemic, the Vos family’s contribution meant

biometric registration, and strengthening national
systems in five States. Zimbabwe incorporated
alternatives to detention in its referral mechanism
for asylum seekers and refugees, while the Republic
of the Congo passed a law establishing the right
to asylum and refugee status and worked towards
ratification of the African Union Convention for the
Protection and Assistance of Internally Displaced
Persons in Africa (Kampala Convention).

A refugee gazes across the Ubangi River in the Democratic Republic of the Congo towards his home country,
the Central African Republic, after fleeing post-election violence.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The number of forcibly displaced and stateless
people in Southern Africa remained above 8.4 million,
a result of conflict and internal displacement in
the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC)
and Mozambique, political violence in the Central
African Republic resulting in refugee movements
into Southern Africa, and the eruption of Mount
Nyiragongo in eastern DRC.
UNHCR responded to vast and repeated
displacement in the DRC, documenting more than
27,400 human rights violations and abuses, especially
in eastern DRC. Gender-based violence was a focus
of UNHCR’s protection work, including in the DRC,
where it prioritized prevention and community-based
approaches, and in Cabo Delgado in Mozambique,
where UNHCR’s strategy aimed at reducing risks and
ensuring quality services for survivors.
UNHCR integrated cash assistance into regular
programming in six operations, undertook site

expansion and shelter construction to decongest
Malawi’s Dzaleka refugee camp and, with the
Vodafone Foundation, expanded the Instant
Network School programme to 12 schools in the
DRC. The economic fallout from COVID-19 pushed
previously self-sufficient refugees and asylum
seekers to seek humanitarian assistance, even
those included in national COVID-19 plans. Access
to testing fell short, and less than 3% of refugees
and asylum seekers received one dose of vaccine,
except in South Africa where vaccine coverage
reached 10% of refugees and asylum seekers. Cash
assistance for 222,000 vulnerable people softened
the impact of the pandemic, and UNHCR and
partners played a vital role in sustaining health care,
including nutrition and HIV services for refugees.
To strengthen accountability to affected populations,
UNHCR added community-based protection staff
in the DRC and Mozambique and a new digital
platform in South Africa. UNHCR also invested
in efforts to reduce waiting times for receiving
asylum and refugee status – by providing legal aid
to enhance access to documentation, expanding

To tackle statelessness, nine operations collected
qualitative data, while four States considered
addressing statelessness in upcoming censuses.
UNHCR partners’ legal clinics helped identify
and assist stateless persons or those at risk of
statelessness in Madagascar, Mozambique and
South Africa, while UNHCR supported the Republic
of the Congo’s initiative to provide 25,000 birth
certificates to undocumented people.

UNHCR implemented an African Development Bank
(AfDB) livelihoods project in Zimbabwe and began
AfDB projects in Mozambique to support electricity
access, agriculture and small traders. In Zambia’s
Mantapala refugee settlement, a Japan International
Cooperation Agency rice cultivation project aimed
to boost self-reliance. UNHCR and partners helped
gender-based violence survivors with vocational
training in DRC, and continued to roll out the
graduation approach in Mozambique. COVID-19related restrictions slowed resettlement, with only
3,105 submissions and 1,400 departures in the
region. Over 30,000 refugees, primarily Burundians,
Central Africans and South Sudanese, returned to
their home countries from countries of asylum in
Southern Africa, mainly the DRC.

Impact of the Global Compact on Refugees
The number of Global Refugee Forum (GRF) pledges in Southern Africa increased from 137 in 2019
to 152 in 2021, with six new pledges by Botswana on statelessness and one by Eswatini on refugee
status determination and livelihoods. 85% of the pledges reported were in progress. In October 2021,
UNHCR and the Southern Africa Development Community (SADC) convened a virtual conference on
operationalizing GRF pledges, attended by representatives of 16 SADC member States, which concluded
with a draft action plan for SADC’s endorsement.
Among the pledges fulfilled in 2021, the Republic of the Congo identified over 150,000 people not
registered at birth and issued birth certificates to more than 25,000, including 5,000 from ethnic minority
groups. It also adopted a law establishing the right to asylum and the status of refugees, enshrining
the principle of non-refoulement and temporary access to territory. Eswatini confirmed the allocation of
1,095 hectares of land to support refugee agricultural activities, and in South Africa a regional training
centre opened its doors, part of an Africa-wide plan with the International Association of Refugee and
Migration Judges. It trained 40 judges from 14 African countries in 2021, and aims to train 2,000 legal
practitioners and judges on asylum and statelessness by 2023.

The lack of funding also meant focusing on only the
highest priority cases of need for life-saving support.
Shelter assistance was often limited to emergency
shelter for the most vulnerable IDPs in the DRC and
Mozambique, rather than better quality transitional
shelter for a wider group of those in need. It was
estimated that more than 540,000 displaced people
in northern Mozambique required basic shelter
assistance and lacked the most critical household
items, including cooking utensils. Nearly 100,000
were left without minimum support for shelter and
household items.

FINANCIAL INFORMATION
Consequences of underfunding
The region received only 55% of its $390 million
budget, a result that owed much to donors of
unearmarked funding, who contributed more than
one third of the total. The overall gap in funding
meant that UNHCR could not fully meet a marked
increase in demand for voluntary repatriation.
Although the number of refugees voluntarily
repatriating more than doubled to 14,000, not all
those wishing to return could be helped to do so,
including at least 500 individuals who indicated a
desire to return to Burundi and the DRC. Failing to
fund repatriation is a false economy, since refugees
and asylum seekers will simply require assistance in
host countries for a longer period.

Underfunding also necessitated a 40% cut in
protection monitoring in the DRC, significantly
reducing UNHCR’s ability to assess and address
protection needs in areas affected by conflict and
frequent reports of human rights violations and
abuses. UNHCR’s available resources to reinforce
community-led protection activities were also
reduced by 57% compared to 2020.

While food insecurity has increased across the
region, funding shortfalls forced WFP to reduce
rations, resulting in an increased need for
UNHCR’s cash assistance, often provided thanks
to the availability of flexible funding. The effect
of COVID-19 on livelihoods and food security
risks drove refugees to resort to negative coping
mechanisms. In addition, food insecurity increased
the need for monitoring the nutritional status of
refugees. Three Standard Expanded Nutrition
Surveys were carried out in 2021 in the Republic
of the Congo, Malawi and Zambia to develop
baseline data.

Zenaba, 26, a refugee from the Central African Republic, has set up a business in Chad to support her family and finance her studies.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
At the end of 2021, there were 10.7 million people
of concern in West and Central Africa – an increase
of more than 1.1 million in a year, including
900,000 new IDPs.
Across the region, political instability, non-state
armed groups and climate-related pressure on
resources fuelled conflict and forced people to flee,
including in risky mixed movements, and hampered
humanitarian access. The protection environment
deteriorated in the Sahel, while the situation in
the Lake Chad Basin remained volatile. Renewed
intercommunal clashes fuelled by competition over
resources in Cameroon’s Far North region forced
people to flee their homes. In the Central African
Republic (CAR), the political and security situation
remained precarious despite improvement in parts
of the country.
Against this volatile backdrop, UNHCR worked
with governments to improve the protection

environment, providing technical and legal
support on the development of asylum laws in
Benin, Côte d’Ivoire, Guinea-Bissau and Senegal,
making progress towards adoption of the Kampala
Convention in Burkina Faso, the CAR, Mali and
Nigeria, and supporting the registration and
documentation of people of concern, for instance
in Burkina Faso where over 47,000 civil identity
documents were delivered. The first draft of a
regional model law to establish statelessness
determination procedures was reviewed at a
regional meeting in November 2021.
Significant efforts were made to strengthen
accountability to affected people in the framework
of the regional C4C initiative, with innovative
two-way communication channels used to share
over 57,000 SMS and WhatsApp messages on
protection topics in nine local languages, including
drawings and audio material adapted for people
with learning difficulties or who cannot read.
Community-based identification and referral
mechanisms along mixed movements routes
were strengthened.

In line with its “Comprehensive solutions strategy
for the situation of Ivorian refugees”, UNHCR
intensified the promotion of voluntary repatriation
and reintegration, paving the way for cessation of
refugee status in 2022, a milestone for all Ivorian
refugees and asylum seekers throughout the
world. More than 278,000 have returned since
2011, while UNHCR will support those who wish
to remain in their host country as legal residents.
Positive outcomes were achieved in terms of
local integration, for instance in Guinea-Bissau
where UNHCR supported the naturalization of
7,000 remaining refugees. UNHCR pursued
resettlement or complementary pathways for
particularly vulnerable individuals for whom no other
durable solution could be expected.
UNHCR distributed $19.3 million in cash assistance
and provided shelter and core relief items to people
of concern. UNHCR sought to prevent, mitigate
and respond to gender-based violence, a prevalent

protection concern in the region, assisting survivors
with psychosocial support, medical assistance
and legal aid in over 12,000 instances. UNHCR
supported 200,000 children to start, continue or
return to school, extending financial, material and
technical support to improve access to education
and mitigate the impact of pandemic or securityrelated school closures.
All countries in the region included refugees
in COVID-19 vaccination plans. In addition to
training over 1,300 health workers and providing
supplies for health facilities and hygiene kits to
12,540 households, UNHCR helped vaccinate over
32,000 refugees during the year.
Every effort was made to deliver assistance in an
environmentally sustainable manner, applying best
practices in water, sanitation, shelter and energy,
from solarizing boreholes in Chad to promoting
alternative energy sources to firewood.

Impact of the Global Compact on Refugees
Of the 146 pledges relating to West and Central Africa recorded as of December 2021, five were fulfilled
in 2021, and 31 were in progress. This brought the total number of fulfilled pledges in the region to six –
four by the Government of Cameroon, one by the Government of Côte d’Ivoire in 2021, and one by the
Government of Chad in 2020.
The four pledges fulfilled by Cameroon related to access to health, education and livelihoods. A tripartite
framework was signed between the National Employment Fund, ILO and UNHCR for the inclusion
of refugees in employment programmes. This will help reduce refugee unemployment and increase
opportunities for economic self-reliance.
Pledges in progress also present significant opportunities to achieve the objectives of the Global
Compact on Refugees, from easing the pressure on host countries to expanding access to third-country
solutions. In Chad, the out-of-camp policy implemented by the Government follows an innovative
“villagization” approach, seeking to reinforce the capacity of host communities to welcome refugees by
supporting them financially and technically. In addition, cooperation initiated by Chad, France and Niger
in 2020 in the framework of the Asylum Capacity Support Group continued with a view to reinforcing
the capacities of Chad and Niger’s asylum systems.

REGIONAL SUMMARIES I WEST AND CENTRAL AFRICA

Consequences of underfunding

shelter interventions, out of 380,000 who urgently
needed assistance. As such, assistance reached
less than 8% of IDPs in a complex, rapidly
worsening crisis.

The regional budget of $727.7 million was only
61% funded by the end of the year. The effects of
underfunding were profoundly felt throughout the
region, posing challenges to UNHCR’s ability to
adequately support people of concern and affecting
all areas of its work, from the provision of life-saving
humanitarian assistance and protection to the search
for durable solutions and regional partnerships.

The repercussions of underfunding were also felt in
terms of protection. In Mali for example, UNHCR was
unable to ensure that identification documents were
provided to close to 880 Malian refugees returning
from Burkina Faso, Mauritania and Niger, and newly
arrived refugees from Burkina Faso and Niger. Out of
1,150 cases of lack of documentation identified, only
270 could be assisted.

FINANCIAL INFORMATION

Throughout the region, operations struggled to
mobilize resources to respond to the secondary and
long-term socioeconomic effects of the COVID-19
pandemic, such as a rapid reduction in livelihoods
opportunities which contributed to occurrences
of gender-based violence, and the disruption of
education for thousands of displaced children.

Lack of documentation is a major protection issue
for both refugees and returnees, who are often
mistaken for members of extremist groups or held
to ransom during their forced displacement journey
across Mali.

Impact of the Global Compact on Refugees

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The Americas region hosted 17 million people
of concern to UNHCR at the end of 2021, 18% of
the global total. UNHCR supported governments’
digitization of national asylum systems and
provided technical support to ensure access to
asylum as COVID-19 border restrictions were
gradually lifted. It advocated for national COVID-19
vaccination programmes to include forcibly
displaced and stateless people, and many did so.
UNHCR worked with civil society to support access
to temporary collective shelters and strengthened
access to individual shelters with rental
programmes. 425 shelter and settlements projects,
mainly in Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Honduras and
the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, benefited
273,000 people. In Mexico alone, UNHCR
supported 148 shelters, mainly run by civil society,
in 44 cities. UNHCR conducted a regional genderbased violence assessment and supported
45,000 survivors of gender-based violence
across the continent.

106 UNHCR GLOBAL REPORT 2021

UNHCR and IOM co-coordinated the Regional
Refugee and Migrant Response Plan (RMRP),
to support 3.3 million people in 17 countries. In
the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, UNHCR
supported implementation of the Humanitarian
Response Plan and led the protection and shelter
clusters, assisting more than 2.93 million people.
Through its co-lead role in the Issue-based
Coalition on Human Mobility, UNHCR contributed
to a common regional approach to address
the challenges of increased mixed and onward
movements. In 2021, more than 133,000 people
risked their lives travelling through the dense jungle
separating South and Central America. A record
number of encounters were also reported at the
US south-western border.
UNHCR worked with Colombia’s Public Ministry
and Civil Registry to provide information and legal
support to more than 80,000 people, undertook
a project on pedagogy and protection for nearly
8,500 Venezuelan refugee and migrant children,
and worked with Colombia’s Victims Unit to improve

The Americas region has 239 Global Refugee Forum pledges, including 33 that were added at the 2021
High-Level Officials Meeting. UNHCR has confirmed progress on 125 pledges, 52% of the total, with
21% fulfilled.
Brazil, Colombia, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador and Peru have initiated different types of
regularization processes to provide documentation and improve access to rights. In 2021, more than
500,000 Venezuelan applicants were approved for some form of regular stay, and more than 3 million
refugees and migrants could potentially benefit from regularization. Colombia has registered more than
1.8 million applicants for Temporary Protection Status. 1.2 million have completed biometric registration
and over 300,000 have been approved and received their documentation.
As part of the regional application of the Global Compact on Refugees and the MIRPS, UNHCR
supported Belize, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico and Panama in responding to
the increased needs of people seeking international protection, including by bolstering access to asylum
systems, regular stay arrangements and documentation, and via inclusion in social protection schemes
and provision of shelter, cash assistance or social security.
Mexico linked over 18,000 refugees and asylum seekers with formal employment opportunities under
a relocation programme managed in coordination with national authorities such as the Mexican
Commission for Refugee Assistance. Local communities benefited from the increased economic activity
while refugees employed by more than 260 companies contributed $5 million in taxes. With support from
private sector foundations, and in collaboration with federal and local authorities, UNHCR helped with
temporary housing, cultural orientation, vocational training, school enrolment and job placement.

FINANCIAL INFORMATION
Consequences of underfunding
In 2021, the region’s budget of $730.8 million
was 60% funded. COVID-19 and a lack of access
to asylum and legal stay drove up humanitarian
needs, fuelling demand for cash assistance and
core relief items. This had to be partially funded
from unearmarked contributions, a precious
resource reserved for cases of greatest need.
Among the beneficiaries of this flexible funding
were 10,000 refugees and asylum seekers living
with chronic medical conditions or in extreme
vulnerability in Costa Rica, and Venezuelans
needing help to obtain Temporary Protection
Status in Colombia. There was still a shortfall for
basic needs, including food, medicine, hygiene
items and basic clothing. In the Southern Cone,
15,000 vulnerable families did not receive cash
assistance, 28,000 people could not access
business/labour market training and opportunities,
and 1,600 people without shelter slept rough in
the streets. Many refugees and asylum seekers
faced eviction, exploitation and abuse, with limited
or no access to health care or social protection. In
Costa Rica, budget constraints limited assistance to
Nicaraguans who had fled the country.
In the context of increased mixed movements,
refugees, asylum seekers and others in need of

protection were exposed to extreme risks at sea
and when travelling on foot through deserts and
wilderness. Underfunding meant UNHCR could not
strengthen identification and referral mechanisms at
borders, reinforce reception capacities for high-risk
cases, nor support access to documentation and
alternative stay arrangements.
The funding gap impeded the protection of
vulnerable children and adolescents in Central
America and Mexico, and some countries in the
Caribbean and the Southern Cone. UNHCR and its
partners had reduced capacity to identify children
needing specialized protection; to provide such
protection; and could not adequately support
family reunifications. The response to genderbased violence also suffered, with less support for
survivors’ recovery and empowerment. In Colombia,
UNHCR’s interventions were limited to a few
communities, leaving many needs uncovered and
vulnerable people exposed to risks.
The Government of Canada with the support of
UNHCR and IOM organized an International Donors’
Conference in solidarity with refugees and migrants
from the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela to address
underfunded needs. Also, the first Solidarity
Event for Forcibly Displaced persons and Host
communities in Central America and Mexico was
organized by the Governments of Costa Rica and
Spain in the margins of the 30th Anniversary of the
Central American Integration System.

COVID-19 affected asylum services, livelihoods,
and solutions. UNHCR’s response sustained
essential protection, targeted cash assistance and
enhanced digital inclusion via help.unhcr.org sites
across the region. Refugees and asylum seekers
were generally included in vaccination and social
protection schemes. In Bangladesh, nearly 80% of
those eligible among 890,000 Rohingya received
a vaccination. Indonesia, Malaysia, Nepal and
Pakistan also vaccinated high proportions of people
of concern. In the Islamic Republic of Iran, refugees
could freely access primary health care but required
insurance for secondary and tertiary care, a cost that
UNHCR covered for 120,000 of the most vulnerable.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Two crises dominated the region in 2021. Violence
and political turmoil displaced over 1 million people
internally in Afghanistan and Myanmar, and at
least 158,000 Afghans fled Afghanistan, while
over 31,000 people fled Myanmar during the year,
19,700 of whom remained displaced outside
Myanmar by year-end.
In Afghanistan, UNHCR stayed throughout
the Taliban takeover and rapidly scaled up its
operation, assisting almost 1 million individuals.
UNHCR provided 293,000 Afghan IDPs with
core relief items, assisted 10,000 persons with
specific needs with either cash and/or in-kind
assistance, and reached 263,000 vulnerable
Afghans with winterization support. UNHCR
monitored and supported survivors of genderbased violence and women at risk, offering
counselling and referral services and meeting
their basic needs.

In Myanmar, working through the cluster system,
UNHCR reached some 287,000 vulnerable IDPs,
which includes new IDPs and the 130,000 displaced
in Rakhine state since 2012. Core relief items
and COVID-related equipment reached tens of
thousands of IDPs, and UNHCR-UNDP quick impact
projects benefited more than 20,000 individuals.
Other emergencies included Typhoon Rai in the
Philippines, where UNHCR’s emergency response
team provided protection, technical expertise and
core relief items to severely affected and hard-toreach communities.
To support children, UNHCR focused on preventing
harm and on addressing each child’s specific
needs, established by best interest procedures.
In Cox’s Bazar, Bangladesh, such programmes
reached 2,500 children at risk and provided
psychosocial support for 48,800 children.
Humanitarian services and education returned to
the camps as COVID-19 subsided, allowing UNHCR
and partners to launch a project to introduce the
Myanmar school curriculum.

overcrowding. To improve access to asylum, UNHCR
supported Thailand’s introduction of a national
screening mechanism and agreed a memorandum
of cooperation with Japan. Steps to eradicate
statelessness resolved 38,000 cases in Central Asia
alone, mainly in Uzbekistan.

UNHCR urged States to share responsibility for
rescuing refugees undertaking risky journeys at sea
and developing safe and legal pathways. In 2021,
almost 800, mostly Rohingya refugees, attempted
movements by sea. Twenty-nine perished.

Despite the crises in Afghanistan and Myanmar
and the complications of COVID-19, 1,400 Afghan
refugees returned home, as did at least
791,000 Afghan IDP returnees recorded by UNHCR
in the last four months of 2021, according to rapid
assessments conducted among 153,700 households
in 333 districts, in all 34 provinces. UNHCR engaged
with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
and other regional actors in pursuit of solutions for
refugees from Myanmar and sought partnerships
to broaden support for complementary pathways
through labour mobility, education and family
reunification.

UNHCR signed a memorandum of understanding
with the Government of Bangladesh that outlined
protection principles in respect of 19,000 Rohingya
refugees relocated to Bhasan Char Island to alleviate

UNHCR submitted resettlement requests for
4,900 individuals, mainly from operations in
India, Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand, and
2,400 departed to third countries.

Impact of the Global Compact on Refugees
Of 126 pledges to the region, 52 were in progress, six were fulfilled and seven were in the planning stage at
the end of 2021. Forty-five official updates were submitted in preparation for the High-Level Officials Meeting
and some States offered new pledges or commitments. After the Taliban takeover in Afghanistan in
August 2021 the Support Platform for the Solutions Strategy for Afghan Refugees bolstered support
for the main refugee-hosting countries, the Islamic Republics of Iran and Pakistan, while reinforcing
investments and efforts toward stability and eventual return and sustainable reintegration. In the spirit of
burden- and responsibility-sharing, Japan and the Republic of Korea progressed on pledges relating to
resettlement and development.
The Japan International Cooperation Agency expanded refugee and host community-related support
and dispatched an adviser to its project in Uganda, while the Korea International Cooperation Agency
developed guidelines and allocated $17 million to support refugees, host communities and other
vulnerable groups in its multilateral projects. New Zealand helped strengthen the Philippines’ capacity
on country-of-origin information in the asylum process, under the auspices of the Asylum Capacity
Support Group, while Thailand took steps towards establishing an asylum screening mechanism.
Several countries progressed on their pledges to reduce statelessness through improved access to birth
registration (Tajikistan, Turkmenistan), an inclusive census (Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan), and naturalization
procedures (the Philippines).

seekers or IDPs. In total, around 21% of people of concern in the region are stateless.

⁵ Beneficiaries of cash assistance related to the impact of COVID-19 may also have received cash assistance within the context of UNHCR’s regular cash assistance programmes and
therefore should not be considered as additional beneficiaries.
⁶ The majority of children and youth counted are refugees who had either access to a connected learning programme, home-based learning, or catch-up and accelerated education
programmes supported by UNHCR and partners.

FINANCIAL INFORMATION
Consequences of underfunding
The regional budget of $896.9 million was 35%
underfunded, hampering vital work including
shielding vulnerable people from the impact of
COVID-19. Most were not covered by national
social protection systems and, although cash
assistance helped mitigate the pandemic’s impact,
54,000 families did not receive the cash assistance
they needed.
Funding shortfalls forced UNHCR to focus on the
most urgent life-saving assistance. Operations
in Central Asia, South Asia and South-East Asia
(beyond the Myanmar situation) struggled to
attract funds. Central Asia relied heavily on flexible
funding, which provided two thirds of its funds in
2021. Without this, UNHCR could not have scaled
up its response to displacement from Afghanistan
to Central Asia nor sustained recent gains in
countering statelessness.
The Afghanistan and Myanmar emergencies
required UNHCR to reprioritize further. In Myanmar,
funding shortfalls were acute, particularly in shelter,
with more than 35,000 vulnerable people exposed
to deteriorating living conditions and natural
disasters.

UNHCR’s Afghanistan situation response had been
critically underfunded for over a decade (inside
Afghanistan and in neighbouring countries). A
significant increase in contributions in 2021 was
welcome but the legacy of previous underfunding
was still felt, and UNHCR was unable to construct
or improve six health facilities and three education
facilities in Afghanistan.
In Bangladesh, underfunding weighed on
the water, sanitation and hygiene sector in
particular, preventing the construction of over
3,000 community sanitary facilities and latrines in
the Cox’s Bazar camps. A UNHCR groundwater
project began in the Teknaf area, benefiting both
refugee and host communities, but still needed
funding for testing and evaluation in 2022.
In South Asia and South-East Asia, limited resources
for cash assistance restricted UNHCR’s programmes.
In Malaysia, UNHCR increased cash assistance for
cases of extreme need, but only 25% of the overall
cash needs could be met and 3,000 families could
not be assisted. Underfunding prevented cash
assistance reaching 1,500 refugee and asylum
seeker households in urban areas in Indonesia and
500 people with specific needs in Thailand. After
Typhoon Rai hit the Philippines, underfunding limited
UNHCR’s emergency response to mostly operational
and coordination support to the Government and
humanitarian partners.

Fast Retailing and UNHCR celebrate 10 years
of global partnership
In 2021, the global partnership between UNHCR and Fast Retailing
– the parent company of brands like UNIQLO – marked its 10th
anniversary. The year also recorded the highest ever financial
and in-kind support from Fast Retailing to UNHCR, for responses
to the Afghanistan emergency and COVID-19, among others.
The relationship extends well beyond financial support, with Fast
Retailing employing some 120 refugees globally and employees helping raise awareness about refugees
among thousands of students in Japan. A Winter Campaign was organized in nine European countries
for the first time to engage UNIQLO customers to support the winter response for displaced people: in
relation to this campaign, some 1 million pieces of winter clothing were donated to UNHCR. $4 million
was also donated to the Rohingya situation from TTY Management B.V., owned by Mr. Tadashi Yanai,
CEO of Fast Retailing.

Novo Nordisk Foundation provides support to
Afghan refugees in Pakistan
In 2021, the Novo Nordisk Foundation quickly responded to the
crisis in Afghanistan and to UNHCR’s Supplementary Appeal,
providing over $3 million to support Afghan refugees in Pakistan,
a country which has hosted refugees from Afghanistan for more
than 40 years. The donation allowed UNHCR to significantly
improve the life of Afghan refugees and host communities in
Pakistan, providing protection and assistance to those already
forcibly displaced as well as new arrivals.

UNHCR handed most of its “Emergency support to
integration and accommodation” (ESTIA) programme
to the Government of Greece, enabling the Office to
refocus on core protection activities and integrating
recognized refugees.

UNHCR and partner staff greet 93 asylum seekers evacuated from Libya to Rome, including children, women at risk,
survivors of violence and torture, and people with serious medical conditions.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

European Union. UNHCR implemented projects
addressing gender-based violence in 10 countries.

Despite COVID-19 continuing throughout 2021,
over 123,000 refugees and migrants arrived in
Europe, 29% more than in 2020. The vast majority
arrived via sea crossings on which 3,130 people
died or went missing. Most arrived in Italy, which
received almost twice as many people as in
2020. Reception conditions in some States were
substandard and overcrowded, heightening
protection risks, particularly for unaccompanied
and separated children, LGBTIQ+ individuals and
victims of trafficking.

To spur the vaccination of refugees and asylum
seekers against COVID-19, UNHCR addressed
administrative barriers, vaccine hesitancy and
misinformation, advocated for inclusion in
social protection schemes, and provided cash
and in-kind support to vulnerable people
of concern. UNHCR and partners delivered
information sessions on preventive measures
and vaccination in collective accommodation in
Armenia, Bulgaria and Romania, where UNHCR
also ran hotlines for COVID-19-related questions.
When schools closed, UNHCR supported
distance learning by providing laptops and
connectivity and advocated for the inclusion
of displaced learners in national education
plans. The Office organized a conference on
statelessness with the Council of Europe,
while Albania and Ukraine moved forward
on statelessness determination procedures and
Iceland acceded to both statelessness
conventions.

The Office advocated for improved protection and
expressed grave concern over reported expulsions
and violent pushbacks of refugees and asylum
seekers, and over moves towards externalizing
asylum and protection obligations. UNHCR’s
court interventions succeeded in five out of six
cases, notably on pushbacks, detention and family
reunification. Six new interventions were submitted,
including two before the Court of Justice of the

124 UNHCR GLOBAL REPORT 2021

UNHCR coordinated protection and shelter in eastern
Ukraine, operating on both sides of the contact line,
undertaking shelter repairs and community projects
for basic services in isolated areas. It assisted
affected populations in Government-controlled
areas with cash, legal aid and services for persons
with specific needs. UNHCR also provided logistical
support to humanitarian convoys on behalf of the
United Nations Humanitarian Country Team. In
Armenia and Azerbaijan, UNHCR assisted conflictaffected people and undertook visits to assess
conditions for eventual returns. The Office revised its
strategy for mixed movements in the Western Balkans
to strengthen asylum systems and help identify
solutions. The regional housing programme had
assisted 8,800 families by the end of 2021, towards
its 11,800 goal for 2022.
1,400 unaccompanied children in precarious conditions
on the Greek islands and 3,500 vulnerable asylum

seekers and international protection holders were
relocated to other European countries. Despite the
pandemic, 21,000 people overall were resettled in
Europe.
Inclusion was a challenge for many States. UNHCR
and the Migration Policy Group developed an
integration toolkit for municipalities, field-tested in
seven countries. A financial inclusion workshop in
Bulgaria led to refugees gaining access to financial
services, and UNHCR and the Microfinance Centre
partnered to enhance financial inclusion. UNHCR
supported refugee inclusion in education by rolling
out “Teaching for Refugees”, a training programme
for primary and secondary teachers. 80 teachers
in North Macedonia and the United Kingdom were
trained as an initial step.
The movement of migrants and asylum seekers
from Belarus into the European Union prompted
strict border procedures, leading to restrictions on
access to protection. UNHCR advocated for access
to territory and asylum, provided basic emergency
assistance for several thousand people stranded in
precarious conditions, and worked on solutions for
individuals of concern.

Impact of the Global Compact on Refugees
The implementation of the 467 pledges made by European entities at the 2019 Global Refugee Forum
progressed significantly. By year end, 55% were in progress, 39% were fulfilled and 13 were in the
planning stage. The engagement of States and other stakeholders was demonstrated by the submission
of more than 200 official updates in preparation for the High-Level Officials Meeting.
The prevention and reduction of statelessness made headway. Iceland acceded to both statelessness
conventions. Ukraine put its statelessness determination procedures into operation, and Albania’s Law
on Aliens, which foresees the establishment of statelessness determination procedures, entered into
force.
Community sponsorship initiatives increased, engaging new actors in receiving and supporting refugees.
One such initiative enhanced coordination among Spain’s central, regional and local authorities to better
welcome and integrate refugees. The creation of humanitarian corridors in Italy also offered solutions to
many refugees from outside the region.
COVID-19 hampered integration and inclusion but pledging entities across Europe persevered with efforts
to enhance the right to work. UNHCR signed a memorandum of understanding with Serbia’s Government
and National Employment Service, facilitating refugees’ access to specific employment measures.

FINANCIAL INFORMATION
Consequences of underfunding

Rising refugee flows brought new challenges, such

and asylum seekers stranded on the border of
Poland and Belarus in November 2021. Available
funding covered only 40% of the identified needs.

The region’s budget of $697 million was 52%

around Mbera camp. All 19 countries in the region
included refugees in their national COVID-19
vaccination plans and began vaccinating them.
UNHCR supported their health responses and acted
to mitigate the wider impact of COVID-19, including
barriers to learning for 2.2 million children.
To tackle statelessness, UNHCR worked with the
International Institute for Humanitarian Law on
training for government officials and other key
interlocutors, and organized a conference with the
League of Arab States on implementing the “Arab
declaration on belonging and legal identity”.

The Middle East and
North Africa
UNHCR staff help Fatemeh, 85, off the bus from Zaatari Camp on 14 January 2021, as she arrives at a health clinic in Mafraq,
Jordan, where she was one of the first refugees in the world to be vaccinated against COVID-19.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Displacement increased in the Middle East and
North Africa in 2021, with a total of 16 million
forcibly displaced and stateless people at year end,
compared to 15.8 million a year earlier. UNHCR
newly registered 128,000 people across the region,
including 15,800 requiring international protection
among mixed movements in North Africa.
The Regional Refugee and Resilience Plan (3RP),
co-led by UNHCR, remained the cornerstone of
support for 5.7 million Syrian refugees and their host
governments. Under the 3RP, over 2 million refugees
received cash assistance, 140,000 children in Iraq,
Jordan, Lebanon and Türkiye received specialized
child protection, and nearly 132,000 children
participated in structured child protection and
psychosocial support programmes. 45,000 women
and men benefited from parenting support.

132 UNHCR GLOBAL REPORT 2021

Overall, UNHCR’s cash assistance benefited more
than 6.2 million people, a vital tool for protection
across the region. In Yemen, UNHCR conducted
over 230,000 protection monitoring assessments
and disbursed $72 million in cash assistance to
1.4 million people, helping vulnerable IDPs to stave
off famine. More than 105,000 families in Yemen
received shelter and core relief item kits, and
41,000 refugees and IDPs received psychological
first aid. In Libya, UNHCR and partners appealed
for the release of detained displaced people and
conducted 400 visits to detention centres, but
UNHCR’s assistance was curtailed after security
concerns forced its Community Day Centre in
Tripoli to close. In Tunisia, UNHCR communicated
with refugee communities on travel risks and the
protection and assistance available. In Algeria,
UNHCR rehabilitated water networks and health
facilities for Sahrawi refugee camps near Tindouf,
while in Mauritania it provided protection and
assistance for 67,500 Malian refugees in and

UNHCR jointly coordinated 270 partners in the
3RP, connecting the humanitarian response with
longer-term programming and national strategies
for inclusive growth and sustainable development.
Linkages to national strategic plans were outlined in
the context of the UNHCR-World Bank partnership in
Iraq, Jordan and Lebanon for 2021-2023. Syrians in

Lebanon faced increasing poverty and vulnerability,
while Jordan issued a record 62,000 work permits
to Syrian refugees. In Iraq, UNHCR focused on
inclusion and development, strengthening access
to national services and employment opportunities
and promoting small-scale infrastructure projects
to make returns sustainable. A participatory
assessment showed the importance of access to
civil documentation for internally displaced and
returning Iraqis. There were over 1,000 refugee
returns to Iraq, while 1% of Syrian refugees made
the decision to return to Syria or were resettled.
The regional intention survey showed the
majority still hoped to return. A regional contact
group for complementary pathways, comprising
100 representatives including resettlement States,
pursued durable solutions via third country
employment and education opportunities and family
reunification programmes. In Libya, 748 refugees
and asylum seekers departed via humanitarian
evacuations, and a further 785 were resettled.

Impact of the Global Compact on Refugees
Of the 70 pledges from the Middle East and North Africa region, 23 were in progress, six fulfilled and
one in the planning stage by year end. 18 official updates on pledge implementation were submitted in
preparation for December’s High-Level Officials Meeting.
Among the policy pledges in progress was Egypt’s commitment to give refugees access to primary
health care and education within national systems. Refugees are now covered by the universal health
care insurance scheme on an equal footing with Egyptians and were included in the roll-out of the
national COVID-19 vaccination plan and the “100 Million Seha” campaign, which aimed at detecting and
eliminating chronic diseases by 2023.
Refugee students were included in the Instant Network Schools programme in Egypt, which aims at
digitizing 108 public schools by 2025 to enhance education programmes for Egyptian, refugee and
asylum-seeking students. The Kuwait Society for Relief pledge was fulfilled. Two grant agreements
were signed with UNHCR towards cash assistance for IDPs in Yemen and Iraq, which benefited
5,524 families in Yemen and 763 families in Iraq. The Sheikh Abdullah Al Nouri Charity Society pledge
was fulfilled, committing to cash assistance for refugees in Jordan through UNHCR in 2021. A pledge was
implemented directly by the Sheikh Abdullah Al Nouri Charity Society in other operations dedicated to
the needs of refugees and IDPs in the region.

510,000 individuals among the prioritized target
population in Jordan, Lebanon and Syria did not
receive cash assistance due to lack of funds.

FINANCIAL INFORMATION
Consequences of underfunding

Underfunding has a tangible impact on activities
with high running costs or long-term investments
in infrastructure – required in refugee camps like
Tindouf in Algeria or Mbera in Mauritania. Areas
that have been deprioritized include malnutrition,
raising teachers’ incentives, renewing deteriorated
shelters, and constructing and maintaining water
distribution systems and schools. Furthermore,
funding gaps meant that innovative interventions
such as a recycling project in Tindouf were not rolled
out beyond the pilot testing phase. The COVID-19
pandemic plunged the communities hosting
refugees into even more economically precarious
conditions than previously, a precarity that was
compounded when winter came and UNHCR lacked
the resources to respond.

Funding needs in the Middle East and North Africa
were the largest among UNHCR’s seven regions,
at $2.702 billion, and the most underfunded at
only 48%, leaving critical gaps in life-saving and
protection needs. While some instances of
underfunding were due to needs stemming from
COVID-19, many pre-dated the pandemic.
Staff shortages weighed on activities requiring
specialized staff — experts in areas such as
gender-based violence, cash assistance and
environment — as well as on UNHCR’s ability
to contact hard-to-reach people of concern.
Lebanon’s cash assistance programme, the largest
in the region, was substantially understaffed, and
only one operation, Jordan, had an environment
specialist. The limited cash or in-kind assistance
was rarely enough to cover the needs of refugees,
and there were high numbers of school dropouts,
evictions and exploitations resulting from refugees’
poor socioeconomic situation. Approximately

THEMATIC CHAPTERS I SAFEGUARDING FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS

THEMATIC CHAPTERS I SAFEGUARDING FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS

Safeguarding
fundamental
rights

70 years after the adoption of the
1951 Refugee Convention, and shortly
after the 2018 Global Compact on
Refugees, COVID-19 profoundly challenged
international protection and solidarity on
issues core to UNHCR’s mandate.
The pandemic exposed shortcomings in
the accessibility to health care and social
protection services in many countries and
highlighted an underlying fragility in the
quality of international protection.

ydfydfdxf

ydfydfdxf

Reports of refoulement practices increased,
including violent pushbacks, border closures
and loss of life at sea. Externalization
policies, shifting responsibility to less
developed countries, jeopardized the
principle that refugee protection obligations
should be equitably shared. Yet numerous
States did meet their international
obligations, granting access to protection
for those in need and showing that arrivals
could be safely managed while protecting
public health interests in a proportionate
and non-discriminatory manner.
To safeguard the fundamental rights of all
people of concern, UNHCR advocated for
access to territory and asylum procedures.
UNHCR lobbied for greater investments
to enhance the full participation of forcibly
displaced, stateless and host communities,
and for a global policy framework with a
comprehensive approach to accountability
and inclusion. Recognizing that meaningful
participation of affected people is essential
to all aspects of UN work, UNHCR,
UN-Women and OHCHR committed to
develop a system-wide policy within the
Common Agenda to put people at the
centre, with a focus on age, gender and
diversity (AGD).

Several States adopted legislative
amendments and other measures to
regularize the stay of stateless persons,
grant them associated rights and reinforce
birth registration. UNHCR strengthened its
global advocacy to eradicate statelessness,
while commemorating the 60th anniversary
of the 1961 Convention on the Reduction
of Statelessness and promoting accession.
COVID-related restrictive measures
disproportionately affected stateless people
due to their lack of nationality, leaving them
less able to access testing and treatment,
and often excluding them from social
services.

UNHCR intervened as a third party in
14 cases in 10 jurisdictions. UNHCR’s
interventions addressed issues regarding
the definition of a refugee; access to
territory and asylum procedures; protection
against refoulement including in the context
of COVID-19; protection of family life; as
well as cessation of and exclusion from
refugee status.

Global Strategic Priorities
Legislation on refugees
Law and policy on IDPs
See p. 12 and p. 15
for GSP results

Results and achievements
International protection is based on the
right to seek and enjoy asylum and the
principle of non-refoulement, fundamental
principles honoured by most States since
the adoption of the Convention relating
to the Status of Refugees in 1951 and its
1967 Protocol. These instruments provide a
solid foundation for international protection
and durable solutions. By the end of
2021, 149 States were party to the 1951
Convention, the 1967 Protocol, or both.
Non-refoulement is well recognized as
customary international law and the right to
asylum is widely reflected in national and
regional law and practice.
Through the publication of country guidance
documents, UNHCR provided evidence
for decision-makers assessing asylum
claims from people fleeing the Syrian
Arab Republic. In addition, given ongoing
instability and violence, UNHCR called
on States not to forcibly return people to
Afghanistan, Burkina Faso, South Sudan
and Yemen.

142 UNHCR GLOBAL REPORT 2021

UNHCR provided States with guidance
on interpreting and applying international
and regional refugee law standards and
engaged with UN agencies and legal, judicial
and academic partners and networks. In
cooperation with the International Labour
Organization, UNHCR issued guidelines on
legal standards of decent work for refugees,
providing guidance for developing legal
frameworks on access to employment, fair
and safe work environments and social
protection. UNHCR also published a note
responding to State policies and practices
which could effectively serve to “externalize”
international protection obligations. The note
emphasizes the importance of international
solidarity and outlines fundamental
standards distinguishing unlawful
externalization measures from lawful
arrangements for transfer of refugees.
In 2021, UNHCR engaged with the legislative
processes of 78 countries. 26 adopted
laws or legislative changes, 17 of which
represented advances in refugee rights.
Although COVID-19 forced many courts to
close or suspend proceedings temporarily,

Kenya’s new Refugees Act 2021 brought
its legal framework further in line with
international and regional legal standards.
The new Act also addresses solutions and
the inclusion of refugees in development
planning, underscoring Kenya’s commitment
to the Global Compact on Refugees.
In Colombia, UNHCR worked with the
Government on a decree providing a
10-year Temporary Protection Status for
an estimated 1.8 million Venezuelans,
improving their protection, access to
essential services and opportunities for
socioeconomic inclusion.
UNHCR stepped up human rights advocacy
through engagement with UN human rights
mechanisms and development of regional
strategies for Europe, the East and Horn of
Africa and the Great Lakes, and West and
Central Africa. UNHCR rolled out “Guidance
on UNHCR’s engagement with national
human rights institutions” and developed
guidance notes on core international human
rights treaties, strengthening understanding
of the overall structure and content of
the treaties and how best to use them in
advancing national legal frameworks for
protecting refugees, internally displaced
persons and stateless persons.
To support human rights engagement (HRE)
by protection clusters, UNHCR issued a note
on strengthening law and policy, factsheets
on UN human rights mechanisms, a pilot
training series, a good practices dashboard
and a field coordination package. The
HRE community of practice reached over
600 active members. UNHCR co-hosted
strategic litigation roundtables, and worked
with IARMLJ on building judicial capacity.

UNHCR issued guidelines on decent work
and on International Human Rights treaties
(ICESCR/CRC/CRPD/CEDAW), and country
guidance and non-return advisories;
and coordinated development of UNHCR’s
Action Plan on Hate Speech, in support of
the UN strategy.
UNHCR engaged on 23 draft HRC
resolutions and with 19 Special Procedures
mandate holders; prepared 18 written
submissions to Universal Periodic Reviews;
and participated in 10 human rights-related
inter-agency task teams, chairing three.

Challenges and unmet needs
While many States solicited UNHCR’s views
on proposed legislative changes in 2021,
those views were not always followed,
leading to legislation with reduced protection
safeguards, or provisions at variance with
the country’s legal obligations. Although
26 countries adopted new laws, nine did not
advance refugees’ rights.

2020 result: 18

As restrictive measures in some countries
have denied access to international
protection for those who need it, renewed
commitment to compliance with international
legal principles and standards is crucial.
UNHCR observed numerous violations of
the principle of non-refoulement. Increased
and often violent pushbacks at borders
and interceptions at sea were reported,
leading to return to persecution and other
serious harm. UNHCR also expressed
concern about proposals made by some
States to externalize international protection,
transferring asylum seekers to third countries
for assessment of their claims, undermining
international solidarity and raising concern
regarding potential non-compliance with
the 1951 Convention. COVID-19 exacerbated
the situation, as several States maintained
border closures and entry restrictions
justified by the necessity of containing
the pandemic.

registered with UNHCR as people of
concern. The Office enhanced reception
and registration modules in proGres v4,
enabling the operation in the Democratic
Republic of the Congo to successfully test
enrolment of 200,000 IDPs. UNHCR made
major efforts to integrate biometric systems,
deploying BIMS to five new operations,
bringing the total to 80 countries using
PRIMES biometrics. The number of
individuals (aged 5 and above) with
biometric records rose from 9.1 million in
2020 to 9.8 million in 2021.

Results and achievements
Registration establishes unique identities
for people of concern and is the basis for
profiling, targeted delivery of protection
and assistance, and access to services.
It contributes to identifying trends and
patterns in population movements, protects
against refoulement, arbitrary arrest and
detention, and helps to reunify families and
trace separated children.

UNHCR’s training on emergency
registration (TER) and the standby
registration roster were partly reconfigured
and adapted to COVID-19 restrictions.
An online version of the TER was piloted
in November 2021, adding 20 UNHCR
registration experts to the emergency
response team roster, and most of the
10 people deployed from the standby
registration roster worked remotely initially
before moving to their duty stations.

In 2021, refugee registration and in
particular biometric enrolment was affected
by COVID-19 and related regulations on
physical distancing and restrictions on
movement. In response, UNHCR relied
on remote registration and digital service
arrangements in Lebanon, Malaysia, the
United Arab Emirates and other operations,
and further invested in the scoping
and testing of contactless biometrics
technologies and new arrangements
to enable people of concern to access
registration, assistance and digital
services online (Self-Service Entry Point
discovery project).

UNHCR’s Population Registration and
Identity Management EcoSystem (PRIMES)
is at the centre of UNHCR’s registration
efforts. It incorporates a global, web-based
case management tool for registering
people forced to flee (proGres v4), a
biometrics capability (BIMS/IrisGuard),
and the Global Distribution Tool (GDT).
Despite COVID-19 restrictions and staff
responding to emergencies, such as those
in the Central African Republic and
Ethiopia, proGres v4 was deployed to an
additional 17 operations, bringing the total
to 117. ProGres v4 grew to 21.7 million
individual records, 96% of all individuals

144 UNHCR GLOBAL REPORT 2021

GDT had been deployed to 22 operations
by the end of 2021, enhancing integrity
of service delivery by using biometrics
to verify identities at the point of service.
GDT also helped UNHCR’s partners to
coordinate a large-scale delivery of
COVID-19 vaccines to Cox’s Bazar,
Bangladesh. UNHCR deployed Verify Plus,
the first ever documentation issuance tool
using digital signatures, and issued more
than 300,000 secure digitally-signed
documents across 15 countries.
In response to increased demand, PRIMES
user-support activities were expanded
substantially in 2021. Currently, UNHCR
supports around 10,000 PRIMES users
(up from 7,200 in 2020). Two thirds are
UNHCR staff, the rest partner staff including
governmental partners.

42

operations deployed
remote registration solutions in
the context of COVID-19 and
in line with UNHCR’s five-year
action plan on digital identity.

Challenges and unmet needs
Moving PRIMES to a more modern cloudbased setup is highly complex and poses
technical and data protection challenges,
which has led to delays. Facilitating
partners’ access to PRIMES, where datasharing arrangements allow, was also
delayed by technical complexities and
intricacies associated with creating an
interoperability framework.
Work on comprehensive digital services
was under-resourced. Despite substantial
learning from the COVID-19 response and
despite advancing on individual projects, a
scalable framework and solution can only
be achieved through a transformational
corporate project, involving sustainable
multi-year resources.

differentiated case processing modalities,
including expedited procedures for
certain nationalities such as Hondurans,
Salvadorians and Venezuelans, among
others, to ensure both fair and efficient
procedures despite a rise in applications.
Another example was South Africa,
which launched an ambitious multi-year
project jointly with UNHCR to reduce its
longstanding backlog of appeal applications.

As the COVID-19 pandemic moved into
its second year, States and UNHCR
continued to make strides in applying
innovative practices to keep asylum
systems functioning effectively. UNHCR
monitored the impact of COVID-19
through its COVID-19 operational data
portal, providing timely support to States
in adapting their asylum systems and
guidance on key displacement situations
and refugee status determination (RSD)
case processing issues to keep asylum
systems functioning fairly and efficiently.
As examples, in 2021, UNHCR issued
country guidance to support asylum
decision-makers on several major
situations, notably Afghanistan and the
Syrian Arab Republic, released a publicly
available online RSD training product
and provided operational support on
different ways of processing asylum claims
(sometimes referred to as differentiated
case processing modalities), as well
as backlog management and other
topical issues.

In parallel, UNHCR also promoted good
practices in the over 50 countries where it
conducts RSD under its mandate, primarily
in different countries in Asia, the Middle
East and North Africa, including by creating
tools for the implementation of its 2020 
RSD procedural standards. As States have
primary responsibility to protect those
seeking international protection on their
territories, UNHCR’s focus is to support
States in taking over RSD responsibilities.
However, where this is not yet possible,
UNHCR continues to ensure that it puts in
place high quality mandate RSD procedures
that can serve as an example and set a
strong foundation for transition.
Many States demonstrated that, despite
challenging contexts, it was possible to
effectively welcome and process those
seeking international protection. Notable
examples include Sudan, which processed
new arrivals fleeing Ethiopia throughout
2021 using an efficient prima facie or groupbased approach to recognition.

After a historic drop in the number of
asylum applications in 2020 due to travel
restrictions and suspensions of asylum
processing brought on by COVID-19,
the number of new individual asylum
applications lodged in national asylum
systems and countries where UNHCR
conducts case processing under its
mandate increased marginally in 2021, but
remained far below 2019 levels. In addition,
the number of individuals recognized on a
group basis decreased. Given the continued
increase in the number of displacement
situations globally, this trend suggests that
more needs to be done to ensure that those
seeking international protection are able
to access territory and fair and efficient
asylum procedures.

In relation to GCR implementation,
while there has been significant positive

the number of offers of support, financial
or otherwise. More will need to be done
to mobilize support to States seeking to

Implementation of Global Compact on
Refugees (GCR) pledges relating to asylum
and in particular the operationalization of
the GCR’s Asylum Capacity Support Group
(ACSG) initiative progressed in 2021. The
online portal for the ACSG was launched in
April 2021, and by the end of the year had
collected a large number of good practices
in the area of asylum and RSD to help
support decision-makers globally. Two new
pledges linked to asylum strengthening
through engaging in the ACSG were made
by Eswatini and the Netherlands in 2021,
and three new matches were realized
under the ACSG’s matching mechanism in
2021: New Zealand with the Philippines,
the European Union Agency for Asylum
with Niger, and Denmark with Kenya. These
new pledges and matches, in addition to
those already made, will strengthen asylum
systems and promote technical exchange
and good practices to support the goals
of the GCR.

In 2021, UNHCR worked to protect,
assist and ensure respect for the rights
of refugees and others under UNHCR’s
mandate who travel alongside migrants.
Co-leading with IOM, UNHCR strengthened
its engagement with partners, mixed
movement working groups and task forces
at country and regional levels.
UNHCR worked with States and partners
to protect refugees and migrants moving
by sea, advocating for strengthened search
and rescue capacity in the Mediterranean
and along West Africa’s Atlantic coast. In
Indonesia, UNHCR identified encouraging
practices, with operating procedures
to ensure coordinated rescue at sea
and disembarkation established under
legislation regulating the response to
new arrivals. UNHCR and its partners also
deployed experts to identify refugees
rescued at sea with specific needs and
to provide specialized services to people
disembarked in Banda Aceh. At the
global level, UNHCR convened an inter-

148 UNHCR GLOBAL REPORT 2021

agency group on protection of refugees
and migrants moving by sea to facilitate
information-sharing and advocacy.
UNHCR developed communication
with communities on the move via the
“Telling the real story” initiative, providing
information on the risks of dangerous
journeys and countering misleading
narratives from smugglers. As co-chair
of the Inter-Agency Coordination Group
on Trafficking in Persons (ICAT), UNHCR
promoted research, policy development
and technical advice. It rolled out an
innovative outreach strategy to strengthen
anti-trafficking responses by holding
regional consultations and establishing
information-sharing channels with frontline
anti-trafficking actors. ICAT’s contribution
to the review of the UN General Assembly’s
“Plan of action against trafficking” was
reflected in the related 2021 Political
Declaration (adopted through General
Assembly Resolution A/RES/76/7).
As co-chair of the Global Protection
Cluster Anti-Trafficking Task Team, UNHCR

issued the “Introductory guide to antitrafficking action in internal displacement
contexts” to aid protection specialists in
internal displacement contexts. UNHCR
co-chaired anti-trafficking coordination
mechanisms in Bangladesh, while in
Guatemala mobile units worked to prevent
gender-based violence, exploitation and
human trafficking, as well as to providing
information, orientation and referral
services. UNHCR collaborated with the
UN Special Rapporteurs on Trafficking in
Persons and on Contemporary Forms of
Slavery and, jointly with IOM, disseminated
the “Framework document on developing
standard operating procedures to facilitate
the identification and protection of victims
of trafficking”. IOM and UNHCR signed
an agreement on operationalizing the
framework in West Africa.
UNHCR updated learning programmes on
mixed movements, trafficking, smuggling
and protection at sea for staff in the East
and Horn of Africa and the Middle East and
North Africa regions. UNHCR co-led the UN
Network on Migration’s Working Group on
alternatives to detention, which organized
two peer-learning events to disseminate
good practices and scale-up pilot projects,
and engaged actively with Working Groups
on pathways for regular migration, and
on climate change. UNHCR cooperated
closely in the network’s preparation of an
International Migration Review Forum and
the design of a pledging campaign for the
Global Compact for Migration.

Challenges and unmet needs
Dangerous sea movements caused fatal
incidents in many regions, including in the
Caribbean, the Atlantic, the Mediterranean
and the Andaman Sea. Desperate people
undertook precarious sea journeys in
overcrowded and unseaworthy vessels,
falling prey to unscrupulous smugglers,
facing pushbacks at sea or denied
disembarkation in a place of safety. Despite
efforts in different regions, systematic
collection of data on incidents at sea was

challenging. UNHCR has proposed further
collaboration with IOM, IMO and other
relevant agencies to progressively address
this gap.
In the Americas, lifting of some COVID-19
border restrictions, contributing to
an already large number of people in
mixed movements, strained capacity
and responses in border areas. There
were reports of rising xenophobia and
intensifying tensions in refugee-hosting
communities, increasing protection risks
for refugees and migrants in a vulnerable
situation. Funding gaps in the COVID-19
response limited UNHCR’s emergency
assistance to the most vulnerable
populations on the move in the region.
In Europe, COVID-19 travel restrictions
remained broadly protection-sensitive,
with exceptions for people seeking
international protection. Nevertheless,
insufficient reception spaces, overcrowding
and inadequate facilities in some locations
in Europe posed challenges to physical
distancing, hygiene and other preventive
measures, compounding risks to health.
Refugees and migrants travelling from East
and West Africa towards North Africa and
Europe faced extreme forms of violence,
including gender-based violence, trafficking,
kidnapping and many other serious abuses.
UNHCR and partners stepped up efforts
to provide protection and assistance in
response to these challenges. This included
helping people access asylum procedures
and referring them to national authorities
where relevant. Limited access, particularly
in remote border areas, created a severe
shortage of critical protection services.
With its mapping of protection services for
victims of trafficking and other vulnerable
people on the move in the Sahel and East
Africa, UNHCR shed light on serious gaps in
assistance, while at the same time seeking
to increase referrals and improving access
to the available services.

Legislation on statelessness
Birth registration
See p. 12 for GSP result

Results and achievements
Despite challenges caused by the COVID-19
pandemic, 2021 saw concrete results in
preventing and resolving statelessness
and protecting stateless persons. Out of
279 pledges made by States at the HighLevel Segment on Statelessness and the
Global Refugee Forum, and additional
pledges by Belgium, Burundi, Iceland and
the United States of America during the
High-Level Officials Meeting in 2021, 81 were
fully or partially implemented by the end
of 2021. UNHCR organized one global and
several regional stocktaking events to scale
up efforts towards pledge implementation
and call for more commitments. UNHCR
implemented several projects to advance the
implementation of pledges, supported with
additional funding from the Danish and US
Governments, including in Somalia, Tajikistan
and Thailand.
13 countries reformed their nationality
laws, policies and practices to close gaps,
better prevent statelessness and provide
solutions for stateless persons. Chile
introduced a safeguard to grant nationality
to all children born on its territory who would

150 UNHCR GLOBAL REPORT 2021

otherwise be stateless. Similarly, Mexico
expanded the right of parents to confer
their nationality on children born abroad. In
Europe, UNHCR continues to advocate for
solutions for identified stateless persons
and reduce statelessness, and Armenia,
North Macedonia, Slovakia and Ukraine
all reformed their nationality legislation to
facilitate naturalization for stateless persons,
thereby providing avenues to reduce
statelessness.
Some States strengthened birth registration
policies and practice, which will help to
prevent statelessness. Kyrgyzstan put
procedures in place to ensure every
child is registered upon birth, regardless
of the parents’ documentation status.
Argentina made improvements to late
birth registration procedures. Following
concerted advocacy efforts by UNHCR
and its legal partner, courts in Bosnia
and Herzegovina are now able to legally
determine place and date of birth to enable
birth registration. UNHCR and UNICEF
published a “Background Note on Sex
Discrimination in Birth Registration” to
support advocacy efforts, and action
by States.

Six States took measures to strengthen the
identification and protection of stateless
persons. Albania, Chile, Colombia and
Turkmenistan passed legislation establishing
statelessness determination procedures
(SDPs), Georgia reduced application
fees for SDPs, and Brazil launched a new
application system which will enable faster
processing, enhanced protection and
facilitate naturalization. Benin and GuineaBissau also took steps towards adopting
SDPs. In Côte d’Ivoire, host to one of the
largest known statelessness situations in
the world, and first country in Africa to have
established an SDP, significant work and
resources are being committed to assess
individual cases, protect stateless persons
and reduce statelessness.
In 2021, UNHCR strengthened its global
advocacy efforts to address statelessness,
organizing two events to commemorate
the 60th anniversary of the 1961 Convention
on the Reduction of Statelessness. In this
anniversary year, UNHCR welcomed the
accessions of Iceland and Togo to both
the UN Statelessness Conventions.
Throughout 2021, governments and
regions developed and adopted action
plans to address statelessness. Georgia,
Namibia and Somalia adopted National
Action Plans to end statelessness, and the
League of Arab States continued its work
on the “Action plan on belonging and legal
identity”. UNHCR continues to strongly
engage with regional organizations and
institutions across the world.

Challenges and unmet needs
COVID-19 disproportionally disadvantaged
stateless persons. Lack of legal residency
meant stateless people typically had limited
access to testing, treatment and immunization
and faced further socioeconomic hardship –
many already live on the margins of society
and have limited access to government
services. The pandemic also hampered
efforts by governments to prevent and reduce
statelessness and slowed progress on the
Global Action Plan to End Statelessness and
the implementation of State pledges.
Rising ethno-nationalism and exclusionary
policies in some countries continued to
create new risks of statelessness and prevent
meaningful progress in certain contexts.
The lack of reliable quantitative and
qualitative data on statelessness continues
to pose challenges to effectively address
statelessness and advocate for solutions.
Current statistics cover only 91 countries
with a total of 4.3 million stateless persons
reported. Despite this overall challenge,
several quantitative and qualitative studies
were concluded in 2021, including in Lebanon
and the Philippines. In addition, countries such
as Kazakhstan and Zimbabwe, with technical
support from UNHCR, plan to develop and
include statelessness and nationality specific
questions in their national censuses. UNHCR
further continued to support the development
of the “International recommendations on
statelessness statistics”, which will likely be
adopted in 2023.

UNHCR’s community outreach volunteers
programme shared information, identified
individuals at heightened protection risk and
supported community mobilization efforts. In
Bangladesh, community outreach volunteers
reached 356,000 refugees through
information sessions and 204,000 refugees
through home visits and monitoring visits.
In the Syrian Arab Republic, 2,800 IDP
and host community outreach volunteers
reached 900,000 people with awarenessraising and information dissemination on
COVID-19 and protection-related topics,
while information sessions and household
visits by 534 community outreach volunteers
in Lebanon reached 878,000 people. A
network of over 2,000 community outreach
volunteers and members of the refugee
elder community in Pakistan played a crucial
role in identifying and referring refugees
at heightened risk, and in Brazil, outreach
volunteers reached 1,695 indigenous people.
UNHCR addressed community concerns
via community-led interventions, engaging
3,672 community leadership and community
structures of women, youth, persons with

152 UNHCR GLOBAL REPORT 2021

disabilities and others. Examples included
training 1,473 members of 81 community
networks in the Bolivarian Republic of
Venezuela to use WhatsApp and movie fora
to disseminate messages to 35,000 people.
In Chad, UNHCR supported the capacity
of 511 community structures comprising
2,283 people in 218 sites, enabling them
to sensitize over 170,000 people on social
cohesion, 17,000 on community mobilization,
127,000 on COVID-19, 3,100 on gender-based
violence and 2,900 on fire prevention.
UNHCR provided training, technical support
and resources to RLOs. In Indonesia, UNHCR
supported 17 RLOs engaged in assisting
communities during COVID-19 by providing
electronic equipment such as laptops,
printers and sewing machines, as well as
personnel protective equipment. In Malawi,
UNHCR partner Jesuit Refugee Service
trained 23 community-based organizations
on managerial and programmatic skills, and
in Bangladesh, UNHCR provided education
materials to 28 Rohingya community-based
organizations that run about 242 learning
centres.
UNHCR completed 898 participatory
assessment exercises globally to help
shape its programmes. UNHCR’s multicountry office in Argentina held focus group
discussions with 654 people, in person
or virtually, while in Lebanon UNHCR
conducted a participatory assessment
with 643 people. In Kenya, 75 focus group

UNHCR sought to engage refugee-led
organizations in identifying barriers to
their own participation. UNHCR and the
European Coalition for Migrants and
Refugees convened a “Refugee ReConnect
Conference” bringing together 175 refugeeled organizations, leaders, advocates and
volunteers from 27 countries to advance
refugees’ participation in Europe. At the
global level, UNHCR established an
Interdivisional Task Team supported by
an interim advisory board of 26 RLOs. It
developed guidance and tools such as a
checklist of meaningful participation at global
events, a mapping tool, the development
and piloting of a grant agreement, and a
side-event on meaningful participation at
the High-Level Officials Meeting.

Challenges and unmet needs
COVID-related restrictions hampered
community-based protection in many
operations, in camps and urban settings.

Sometimes these problems were overcome
with remote and digital solutions, but
there was poor connectivity and limited
access to digital means, particularly for
women and girls, in countries such as
Bangladesh, Costa Rica and the Democratic
Republic of the Congo (DRC). Insecurity
and violence also created barriers and
hindered the full participation of forcibly
displaced communities. This was the case in
Afghanistan, Chad and El Salvador. In many
countries, gender inequality and cultural
barriers and norms had a significant impact
on the participation of women and girls, and
some operations reported women being
threatened and feeling unsafe in taking a
role in community leadership activities. In
several countries, including the DRC and
Lebanon, the socioeconomic situation
impacted the community’s engagement and
participation as well their ability to access
services and activities. Many operations
reported that underfunding limited their
ability to support community-led initiatives,
create spaces for communities to meet and
organize, and pay incentives to community
volunteers.

SPOTLIGHT: Strengthening peaceful coexistence
UNHCR’s work in community-based protection included a wide variety of programmes and
activities aiming to foster peaceful coexistence within and between forcibly displaced and host
communities. Programmes for returnees in Côte d’Ivoire, the DRC, Mali, Myanmar and South Sudan mostly
involved support for economic recovery in the location of return. Some programmes, for example in Brazil,
Jordan and Mauritania, encouraged empowerment and participation of women in peaceful coexistence
programmes. Programmes to mitigate, prevent and respond to discrimination and xenophobia towards refugees
and asylum seekers were implemented in Colombia, Costa Rica, France, Greece, Malaysia, South Africa and
the United States of America. UNHCR implemented small-scale projects to integrate host and forcibly
displaced populations in Afghanistan, Central African Republic, the Republic of the Congo, India, Lebanon,
Mozambique, Nigeria, the Philippines, Sudan, Ukraine, the United Republic of Tanzania and Yemen.
Other peaceful coexistence initiatives included area-based programming for protection and solutions in Iraq,
host community solidarity projects in Bangladesh, and caravanes de paix in Chad. Operations in Cameroon,
France, Ghana, Indonesia, and Kenya focused on education as a platform for social cohesion. UNHCR’s push
to vaccinate forcibly displaced people offered the same benefit to the host community in Costa Rica, India,
Libya, Malaysia and Mexico. Innovative approaches using the arts and other skills-building programmes
helped cohesion in Brazil, the Republic of the Congo and Georgia, while sport programmes between forcibly
displaced and host communities in Colombia, the DRC, Ethiopia, Niger and South Sudan engaged youth as
agents of peaceful coexistence. Some initiatives used social media to promote peaceful coexistence, such as
a WhatsApp information line in Ecuador which reached over 22,170 persons. Country operations in Ecuador
and France worked with social media influencers, including refugees, to foster peaceful coexistence.

messaging applications as one of many
channels of communication with people of
concern. A new WhatsApp pilot – in Brazil,
Chile, Ecuador, Indonesia and Sudan –
reached over 38,000 individuals, enabling
them to contact UNHCR and ask questions
related to COVID-19 and other protection

Results and achievements
UNHCR is committed to systematically
listening to people, delivering on what they
need and ensuring that the people UNHCR
works with and for are central actors
within the response. In recognition of this
commitment, in 2021 UNHCR developed
a five-year plan to strengthen the
organization’s accountability to affected
people (AAP) and committed resources to
better ensure engagement in and support
to collective AAP efforts.
UNHCR used its footing in the humanitarian
system to lead on AAP, as co-chair with
UNICEF of the Inter-agency Standing
Committee (IASC) Results Group 2 on
Accountability and Inclusion, and to
advocate for increased participation and
inclusion of affected communities in existing
humanitarian infrastructure. Uganda’s
Refugee Engagement Forum, for example,
has a representative leadership structure
through which elected members are able
to directly advocate on behalf of their
communities. The work done through the

154 UNHCR GLOBAL REPORT 2021

Interdivisional Task Team on meaningful
participation was a key element of this
work, and of ensuring accountability to
affected communities (see the section on
Community-Based Protection on page 154).
Building on efforts made in 2020 during the
onset of the pandemic, UNHCR promoted
the recognition that information is a
form of assistance and also highlighted
the critical need for ensuring safe and
accessible feedback mechanisms, including
for sensitive complaints such as sexual
exploitation and abuse.
Throughout 2021, UNHCR invested in
multiple channels of communication to
maintain proximity with people of concern.
This included further development of callcentre (or contact centre) approaches such
as the inter-agency feedback referral and
response mechanism in Uganda, and large
call centres operated in Jordan, Lebanon
and Türkiye. To support efforts to diversify
communication channels, UNHCR published
“Using social media in community-based
protection: a guide”, since developed

With UNHCR support in Jordan, community
leaders managed WhatsApp trees reaching
over 62,000 refugees. Through these
trees, leaders were able to channel refugee
feedback directly to UNHCR. To ensure no
one was left behind, community leaders
also conducted home visits to refugees
who had less access to digital channels to
share information and mobilized additional
community members to share information
and hold community meetings to reach
refugees of all ages and genders and with
diverse characteristics.
Based on research conducted during
2020 and 2021, UNHCR improved
the accessibility and useability of the
help.unhcr.org pages. 14 new pages were
set up in 2021, including those established
in the Islamic Republics of Afghanistan, Iran
and Pakistan within days of the Taliban’s
takeover of Afghanistan, immediately
providing Afghans with safe, trusted and
relevant information. Pages have also been
developed with child-friendly content.
Using information generated by
the assessment on “Digital access,
communication needs and community
practices” in Côte d’Ivoire, Mali and Niger
in 2021, UNHCR and partners were able
to launch new digital campaigns using
preferred channels of communication, such
as SMS, interactive voice response and
WhatsApp groups, ensuring enhanced twoway information-sharing with communities
on gender-based violence, child protection,
education, prevention of sexual exploitation
and abuse, statelessness and voluntary
repatriation.

Challenges and unmet needs
In 2021, there was a need for more
resources for AAP at the operational level,
including the right tools and technologies –
including contact centres, messaging apps,
toolkits and guidance – as well as trained
personnel and staff. There was also a need
to improve the use of feedback data and
engagement with communities, ensuring
their voices informed programming and
decision making. Doing so is challenging
since it involves unstructured qualitative
data from a variety of sources, online
and offline, which requires investment in
analytical systems. UNHCR also recognizes
the need to improve communication across
initiatives and agencies and is working
on better integrating AAP, inclusion and
prevention of sexual exploitation and
abuse across humanitarian responses and,
crucially, at the onset of an emergency.
Despite its critical impact only 30% of
pledges made at the 2019 Global Refugee
Forum reflected age, gender and diversity
(AGD) considerations. UNHCR developed
recommendations for the integration of
AGD elements at the stocktaking events
leading up to the High-Level Officials

Results and achievements
In situations of crisis and displacement,
children, adolescents and youth are at risk
of various forms of abuse, separation from
their carers, neglect, violence, exploitation,
trafficking or military recruitment. A 2021
audit and evaluation captured the scope
of UNHCR’s global work to protect and
assist children, and UNHCR published
technical guidance, including “Best
interests procedure guidelines” and
an accompanying toolbox, as well as
“Guidance on child-friendly procedures”
and “Guidelines on supervised
independent living for unaccompanied
children”. UNHCR also contributed to
“The unprotected: annual spotlight on
child protection funding”.
UNHCR developed a data dashboard with
an interactive overview of all available
child protection data, and supported
quality information management for case
management, using the protection module
in proGres v4 to create almost 27,000 child
protection cases in 38 countries.

156 UNHCR GLOBAL REPORT 2021

Of 66 UNHCR operations reporting on
child protection issues in 2021, 82% said
there was a lack of adequate care for
unaccompanied and separated children,
68% cited limited access to child protection
services, 52% legal and documentation
risks, 44% physical and mental health
concerns, 41% risks related to gender-based
violence, and 26% physical or emotional
violence or abuse.
There was progress in Mali, Niger, Peru and
the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela on the
inclusion of refugees and asylum seekers
in national child protection systems,
and progress on the inclusion of IDPs in
Nigeria, where UNHCR trained nearly
600 people responsible for developing and
implementing child protection services.
In Peru, UNHCR trained nearly 2,600,

towards establishing child protection
coordination, partnership and programming.
The same proportion, 86%, delivered
child protection services, increasing best
interests assessments globally by 16% after
a 18% decrease in 2020. 64% of operations
engaged in activities to build children’s
resilience and life skills, including through
education, sport, art or other structured
activities, while 58% undertook community
engagement such as behaviour change
initiatives or child friendly spaces. 44% of
operations supported families caring for
children, including with legal counselling
and cash assistance, psychosocial support
and support for foster families.

Challenges and unmet needs
56% of operations cited COVID-19 as a
key challenge, since it restricted education
and youth opportunities while increasing
poverty, isolation and violence against
children, including gender-based violence.
Many operations continued remote case
management and worked with community
outreach workers and volunteers to
strengthen identification and referral.

In Belize, over 100 birth certificates were
issued to newborns, as well as late birth
certificates to adults, marking a significant
achievement as a 2016 “Bottleneck analysis
of birth registration” found that 3-5% of births
were unregistered in Belize. In South Sudan,
training and mentorship of community
outreach workers led to the number of best
interest assessments for unaccompanied,
separated, and other children at risk
exceeding initial targets by 124%, while
referrals to service providers for support of
vulnerable children exceeded targets by 136%.

The most frequent child protection
challenges were in government capacity
(reported by 53% of operations), national
administrative barriers (52%), legal and
policy frameworks (42%), UNHCR staff
capacity (42%), funding (39%), access to
people of concern (29%), coordination
between responders (23%), partner

operations maintained
or improved the participation
of women in leadership and
management structures.
Target: 54 | 2020 result: 48

Results and achievements
Gender equality is integral to UNHCR’s
protection mandate. Gender inequality is
both a cause and a consequence of forced
displacement. In 2018, UNHCR set out
five updated commitments to women and
girls, and they continued to guide its
work in 2021.
The ubiquity of all forms of gender-based
violence in conflict zones is often a major
factor driving people to flee their homes,
and in 2021, women and girls already
facing deep-rooted inequalities were
disproportionately affected in conflict and
disaster settings. The fall of the Afghan
government in 2021 and the subsequent
repression of women’s and girls’ rights
forced many to flee. Security threats
were disproportionately cited by Afghan
women and girls as a reason for fleeing.
The participation of women in leadership
structures in Ethiopia remained low in 2021,

158 UNHCR GLOBAL REPORT 2021

with women excluded from decision-making
in the protracted conflict.
The pandemic exacerbated gender
inequality, with forcibly displaced women
and girls disproportionately affected by loss
of livelihoods and economic autonomy, the
increase of unpaid care work, disruption
to education and heightened health risks.
UNHCR published “Protecting forcibly
displaced women and girls during the
COVID-19 pandemic” to share good
practice and recommendations about how
to respond. Further recommendations
on bringing gender equality into the
mainstream of humanitarian action were
heard at the UNHCR-supported HighLevel Event on Gender Equality in June.
The following month, UNHCR became a
signatory to the new “Women, peace and
security and humanitarian action compact”
during the Generation Equality Forum,
committing to increase resources to prevent
and respond to gender-based violence

and to increase work to support gender
equality, including working with womenled organizations to ensure women’s and
girls’ voices are heard. UNHCR worked
with the refugee-led Gender Audit Team,
which contributes to and shapes the
process towards a longer-term framework
for commitments on gender equality and
women’s and girls’ empowerment linked
to the Global Compact on Refugees.
The team audited UNHCR’s High-Level
Officials Meeting and related events,
producing recommendations for the 2023
Global Refugee Forum. The World BankUNHCR Joint Data Center published
“The gender dimensions of forced
displacement”, a digest of recent research,
while UNHCR issued a background note
on “Gender equality, nationality laws
and statelessness” and contributed to a
brochure on good practice for including
stateless women and girls in humanitarian
programming.
UNHCR is committed to ensuring both
equal and meaningful participation of
women and adolescent girls in all decisionmaking processes and structures in
forced displacement contexts. In India,
women’s participation in leadership
rose to 45% from 39% in 2019 and 2020,
although below the levels reported in
2017 and 2018, with women held back
by their limited connectivity, especially
Rohingya women and girls outside of
New Delhi. In Sudan, efforts to include
women in camp leadership also proved
fruitful, and women made up 25% of
leadership roles – a significant increase
from 5% the previous year. In the United
Republic of Tanzania, 1,671 refugee leaders
were elected in the Nyarugusu camp, of
whom 812 were women. In Cameroon’s

Northwest and Southwest regions, women
and girl IDPs faced constant protection
threats, prompting efforts by UNHCR and
partners to involve women in decisionmaking and peace-building. By the end of
2021, 71 women were actively taking part
in community decision-making, helping
UNHCR to address protection needs and
formulate solutions for women and girls.

74 staff completed the

Gender Equality eLearning
programme, which was
launched in English in 2020
and translated into French and
Spanish in 2021.

Challenges and unmet needs
Throughout 2021, the pandemic constrained
UNHCR’s ability to protect forcibly displaced
and stateless women and girls. Movement
restrictions exacerbated inequalities,
gender-based violence, sexual exploitation
and abuse, and hindered women’s and
girls’ access to information flows and
decision-making. In Lebanon, vaccine
scepticism was an area of concern and
UNHCR strove to improve health messaging
and communication to address medical
misperceptions around COVID-19 vaccines,
including for children and pregnant and
lactating women. In Sudan, UNHCR and
partners were only able to conduct a few
training sessions and awareness-raising
initiatives on gender-based violence, partly
due to COVID-19 restrictions. In certain
countries, illiteracy remains a challenge, as
well as restrictive cultural norms and deeply
patriarchal attitudes that prevent women
from participating in leadership roles.

UNHCR provided guidance to
operations on COMPASS to
ensure that programming was
age and gender sensitive.

Furthermore, lack of funding hampered
the collection of data needed to inform
protection needs and the provision of
adequate protection services, including
reaching remote communities, as well as
technical expertise on livelihoods and
other activities.

Under-identification of persons with
disabilities presents a significant challenge
to facilitating and monitoring their access
to protection and assistance. An estimated
15% of the global population have a
disability, which would suggest 13 million
of the world’s 89 million forcibly displaced
people have a disability. To address
their invisibility, UNHCR integrated a
UN standardized tool for the identification of
persons with disabilities, the “Washington
Group questions on disability statistics”,
into UNHCR’s registration system. To
ensure an adequate use of these questions,
over 1,400 UNHCR and partner staff
received online training and guidance
materials on data on persons with
disabilities.
UNHCR operations provided targeted
services for an estimated 480,000 persons
with disabilities in 2021, including at least
7,615 children with disabilities. UNHCR also
provided targeted services for 71,796 older
people. These services included accessing

inclusive education, targeted cash
assistance, protection case management,
skills development, rehabilitation, and
assistive devices to support their autonomy.
In Ukraine, persons with disabilities
accounted for 19% of UNHCR’s individual
protection cases as of December 2021. In
Afghanistan, the UNHCR-led protection
cluster and its four areas of responsibility
supported at least 143,963 persons with
disabilities.
To further strengthen the capacity of
UNHCR and partner staff on disability
inclusion, UNHCR published a “Facilitator’s
guide to working with persons with
disabilities in forced displacement”
and organized regional and global
introductory training in partnership with
the International Disability Alliance
(IDA), a network of 14 global and regional
organizations of persons with disabilities.
A virtual digital accessibility bootcamp
gathered participants from refugee-led
organizations and organizations of persons
with disabilities in Kenya, Malawi, Somalia
and Uganda to design innovative solutions

Acknowledging the role of organizations
of persons with disabilities in solutions
that affect their lives, UNHCR and
IDA developed a webpage and an
introductory document in four languages
and International Sign to disseminate the
objectives of their collaboration among
the 1,400 members of IDA. Seven regional
consultations, one global workshop
with youth with disabilities, and one
consultation with the World Federation
of the Deaf identified concerns and
priorities in including forcibly displaced
and stateless persons with disabilities in
the way forward. Recommendations on
the way forward were reflected in a report
in four languages and International Sign.
Additional regional reports on the situation
of persons with disabilities and older
people were launched in the Americas, and
West and Central Africa, followed by tools
on digital accessibility. Training materials
on the protection of forcibly displaced older
persons were developed and will be piloted
in the Americas.
In addition, at least 30 UNHCR operations
undertook consultations with persons with
disabilities, and refugees with disabilities

participated in community groups and as
volunteers in Algeria, Bangladesh, Türkiye,
and the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela,
where women with disabilities took part in
the Empowering Refugee Women project.
As a key highlight of the year on social
participation, the first ever refugee
Paralympic team competing in Tokyo sent a
message to the world on the power of sport
to promote inclusion.

Challenges and unmet needs
The consequences of underfunding had a
direct impact on the protection of persons
with disabilities and older persons. At least
57 operations could not provide assistance
to every person who was identified as
being in need. Unmet needs ranged from
access to medical care, inclusive education,
livelihood opportunities, rehabilitation and
assistive devices. Children with disabilities
faced challenges in accessing education
due the limited number of experienced
teachers, lack of accessible facilities and
challenges in reaching the schools. The
pandemic contributed to these challenges
as remote learning and virtual jobs were
less accessible for children and adults with
disabilities. UNHCR will continue working
on making digital spaces accessible for
persons with disabilities while ensuring
access to physical spaces and information
on an equal basis throughout 2022.

UNHCR issued an updated
“Need to Know Guidance”
and a regional report
on older persons
on the move.

480,000

persons

implementing its age, gender and diversity
policy in work with LGBTIQ+ people,
developed an updated training package
jointly with IOM, and produced online
training for UNHCR and partner staff. In
2021, 148 staff benefited from the UNHCR
Online Course on working with LGBTIQ+
people in forced displacement.
In the Americas, UNHCR supported
the regional LGBTIQ+ human mobility
network’s efforts to create inclusive
services and safe referral pathways for
LGBTIQ+ forcibly displaced people. This
collaboration facilitated the integration
of LGBTIQ+ sensitive services into the
regional Support Spaces Network, an
inter-agency initiative of the R4V Platform,

In El Salvador, UNHCR’s partner COMCAVIS
TRANS supports trans women and other
LGBTIQ+ displaced people, providing
individual legal assistance and psychosocial
support. Throughout the country,
COMCAVIS TRANS empowers community
groups to enhance support networks and
actively advocates for the rights of the
LGBTIQ+ community.
In Italy, UNHCR helps LGBTIQ+ organizations
access funds to set up anti-discrimination
centres. In collaboration with Il Grande Colibri,
an LGBTIQ+ refugee-led organization,
UNHCR launched an information campaign,
“Io ho diritto alla salute”, for LGBTIQ+
and male survivors of gender-based
violence. LGBTIQ+ need to know guidance
and a gender-based violence pocket
guide were made available in Italian and
disseminated broadly amongst institutional
and non-institutional actors, including
reception centres and community-based
organizations.

Challenges and unmet needs
While the investments of recent years
have enhanced the protection space for
many displaced and stateless LGBTIQ+
people, immense challenges remain.
Almost 70 countries continue to criminalize
LGBTIQ+ people and retain discriminatory
laws, creating a context which allows
institutional and public hostility and where
acts of exploitation and violence against
LGBTIQ+ people go unpunished.
The stigma and discrimination experienced
by LGBTIQ+ people force them to hide their
identities, making it difficult for humanitarian
actors to identify them and provide support
in a timely manner. Overcoming the deeprooted political, cultural, religious and other
realities which stand in the way of progress
in this work requires continued focus and
investment by diverse stakeholders in
advocacy and response. Creating safe
spaces and establishing services that
are safe and inclusive requires increased
investments in human resources and
partnerships, including with LGBTIQ+
frontline organizations. However, often such
partnerships are hindered by the presence
of discriminatory national laws and/or heavy
partnership requirements that cannot be
met by these organizations. UNHCR is
investing in the training of its workforce and
the development of new tools to address
some of these barriers and increase the
capacity of UNHCR to engage in direct
partnership with community-based and
grassroots organizations.

600 participants joined a
Global Roundtable including
204 (31%) from civil society
and 78 (12%) refugee-led

Responding
with life-saving
support

Humanitarian crises are increasingly
complex, with rapidly evolving access
and security constraints. COVID-19 and
the worsening effects of climate change
have intensified these challenges and
exacerbated inequalities. Globally,
refugees, IDPs, stateless people and
returnees continue to be affected by
new emergencies, as well as protracted
ones, resulting in spikes in humanitarian
and protection needs and straining
existing resources. In 2021 alone, UNHCR
issued 40 new emergency declarations
in 29 countries. In Afghanistan, UNHCR
provided core relief items, cash assistance
and other emergency support to around
1 million internally displaced people; in
Ethiopia, UNHCR protection interventions
and assistance reached 1.2 million internally
displaced people. Both situations were
declared Level 3 emergencies, triggering
a UNHCR-wide response. By year’s end,
33 UNHCR operations identified high
risks of new or escalating multi-hazard
emergencies in refugee and IDP settings.

ydfydfdxf

UNHCR mobilized its operational capacity
to provide a coordinated and timely
response to emergencies, including
surge staffing and delivery of core relief
items, while ensuring security support to
operations. Furthermore, UNHCR made
significant strides in its review of its
“Policy on emergency preparedness and
response”, which will be updated in 2022.
Revisions to the policy aimed to simplify
procedures, strengthen predictability
and effectiveness in preparing for and
responding to climate-related and other
natural hazards, and reinforce coordination
responsibilities and accountabilities
in refugee and internal displacement
emergencies in line with UNHCR’s
overall move toward decentralization and
regionalization.

Early and effective gender-based violence
programming is life-saving for women,
girls and other people facing heightened
risk. It is essential that from the onset of an
emergency, there are quality gender-based
violence prevention and response services
– psychosocial, health, security and legal –
as well as effective risk mitigation across all
sectors.
Other life-saving support – including cash
assistance, support to access health care,
mental health and psychosocial support,
nutrition interventions, food security,
access to water, sanitation, hygiene and
shelter – aimed to meet the immediate
needs of forcibly displaced people and host
communities. This included preventing and
responding to the COVID-19 pandemic.
These interventions were designed to
foster resilience and support the inclusion
of people of concern into existing services,
which would further contribute to protection
and solutions for the forcibly displaced.

Results and achievements
UNHCR declared 40 new emergencies
in 29 countries in 2021, including two
Level 3 emergencies, triggering a wholeof-UNHCR response, and nine at Level 2,
bringing on regional support. There were
also 29 Level 1 declarations, activating
proactive preparedness, which reflects
a systematic approach to neighbouring
country preparedness, with staff and
resources in place. UNHCR’s response to
these situations was guided by the High
Commissioner’s “Policy on emergency
preparedness and response”.

To support and simplify overall
preparedness mechanisms, UNHCR
aligned emergency risk analysis with
enterprise risk management processes by
introducing the new risk management tool
for emergencies, while contingency plan
and emergency plans were incorporated
in UNHCR’s results-based monitoring
system, COMPASS. UNHCR participated in
the IASC Early Warning, Early Action and
Readiness (EWEAR) group, contributing to
its semi-annual early warning report and
eight monthly briefs. The reports identified
22 potential humanitarian crises that would
require a coordinated response.

UNHCR managed 447 emergency
deployments, including 306 new
deployments (a 43% increase). 58% of
deployments were from internal emergency
rosters and internal missions, and 42%
were in-kind contributions from emergency
standby partners. Destinations included
Afghanistan, the Central African Republic,
Chad, Colombia, the Democratic Republic
of the Congo (DRC), Ethiopia, the Islamic
Republic of Iran, Mozambique, Pakistan,
Sudan and Thailand. 228 UNHCR staff
and partners attended Workshops on
Emergency Management (WEM) and
211 completed emergency management
training such as the Senior Emergency
Learning Programme (SELP), Situational
Emergency Training (SET) and Emergency
Team Leadership Programme (ETLP). The
focus on working with national partners
and the importance of involving them in
preparedness and contingency planning
was stressed during the training sessions.

UNHCR’s Field Security Service responded
when necessary to 368 security incidents
and 36 critical incidents, spending 259 days
providing emergency and functional
support to operations. UNHCR conducted
eight webinars to ensure security personnel
could apply new policies and processes
of the UN Security Management System.
UNHCR also hosted and facilitated hostage
incident management (HIM) training for the
UN Security Management System in which
22 security professionals from UNHCR
and other organizations participated. In
total, over 250 personnel were trained,
including on analysis/reporting (63 people),
person-centred approach to security risk
management (40), personal security risk
assessment (45), prevention of sexual
exploitation and abuse/sexual harassment
(90), and mentoring and coaching (13).
UNHCR’s field safety advisors conducted
webinars on duty of care for 15 high-risk
duty stations.

The seven-person Emergency Surge Team
responded within 72 hours to emergencies,
mainly at Level 2 or 3, and spent 797 days
on emergency and functional support
missions (compared to 814 days in 2020)
with a focus on Afghanistan, Colombia,

in interorganizational processes including
the Road Safety Steering Committee, the
Advisory Committee on Occupational
Safety and Health, development of
Enterprise Risk Management tools. New
inter-agency security policies and quick
reference tool materials were disseminated
with appropriate guidance for UNHCR
managers and security personnel.

Due to the pandemic, some activities were
not realized and face-to-face training was
postponed. Participants identified that
women’s security awareness training in
particular was ill-suited to an online format
where safe spaces could not be guaranteed.
This training was largely put on hold until
face-to-face conditions are possible again.
The Workshop on Emergency Management
(WEM) and other emergency training had to
take place virtually, hence some practical
elements could not be included.

emergency response.

Global Strategic Priorities
Emergency preparedness
and response
See p. 16 for GSP result

Results and achievements
Effective service delivery to emergencies
was essential in 2021, as global transport
networks had not yet recovered from the
disruptions created by the pandemic. In
2021, UNHCR’s supply chain faced volatile
air and sea freight markets, including
container shortages, high cargo rates, longer
transit times and difficulties with customs
clearance and manufacturing. UNHCR
diversified its supplier base for personal
protective equipment (PPE) and medical
items through a formal solicitation process
and inter-agency procurement mechanisms,
and replenished stockpiles established in
Dubai and Accra to supply operations with
PPE and other vital COVID-19 supplies free of
charge, on demand.
Despite the pressures from COVID-19,
UNHCR continued to respond to new
and ongoing emergencies throughout
2021, dispatching $47.6 million worth of
emergency core relief items (CRIs) from
its strategically located stockpiles (GSMs),
serving 132 requests. 1,400 metric tons
of CRIs were shipped by air, 4,700 tons
by sea and 4,400 tons by road. UNHCR
carried out 28 airlift rotations from Dubai,
Amman and Nairobi GSMs. The recipients

168 UNHCR GLOBAL REPORT 2021

of this assistance were the Democratic
Republic of the Congo (for the emergency
in the Central African Republic), Uzbekistan
(flights donated by the UPS Foundation,
for the Afghanistan emergency) and Sudan
(for Sudan and the northern Ethiopia
emergency). Global stocks were regularly
replenished to ensure they could meet the
urgent needs of up to 600,000 people in
simultaneous and complex emergencies.
To maximize the potential of the supply
chain, UNHCR proactively engaged with
sister agencies and partners, collaborating
through the Logistics Cluster, the UN
Procurement Network, the UN Global
Marketplace and the Common Procurement
Activities Group in Geneva. The Office also
capitalized on the long-term agreements
established by other UN organizations,
resulting in increased efficiency, active
collaboration, better service delivery
and cost-effective tendering. UNHCR
also provided contract administration for
over 400 global frame agreements, while
procurement value was $1.34 billion in 2021,
excluding cash assistance.
To optimize the use of resources, UNHCR
continued to prioritize the practice of
secondary bidding for high-value orders

UNHCR’s “Operational strategy for climate
resilience and environmental sustainability
2022-2025” outlines the steps for
improving the sustainability of the end-toend supply chain, including manufacturing
of CRIs and more efficient and leaner
delivery mechanisms, following an initial
environmental impact evaluation that found
CRIs collectively represented approximately
60% of UNHCR’s total greenhouse gas
emissions.
UNHCR reinforced its operational capacity
with emergency supply deployments, virtual
supply missions, field procurement support,
policy development and guidelines. It also
rolled out the eSubmission tool globally
(allowing online submission, review
and approval of procurement actions)
and vetted partners for undertaking
procurement using funds allocated by
UNHCR to assist populations of concern.
UNHCR provided familiarization sessions/
webinars on the new Procurement Policy
(attended by 1,400 people worldwide);
face-to-face workshops on procurement
policy in the Middle East, North Africa
and Europe (110 people); an annual
pre-audit workshop for 20 targeted
operations (300 people); training for
UNHCR’s Southern Africa regional bureau
on selection of financial service providers
for cash assistance (over 100 participants);
the Certification Programme for Supply
Chain Management (37 accreditations);
and eight online training sessions on the
eSubmission tool (600 people worldwide).

Challenges and unmet needs
COVID-19-related disruptions posed the
main challenge to UNHCR’s supply chain.
Another area of concern remains staffing
capacity, with temporary staff required to

cover the usual business activities and
additional workload. A Supply Complexity
Analysis was made available to country
operations and regional bureaux to assist
them in tailoring the workforce to the
complexities of their operations.
In addition, the pressure of concurrent
emergencies and COVID-19 meant UNHCR
was not always able to deliver relief items
from the GSMs to respond to emergencies
in 2021 as quickly as desired. Additional
resources will be required to optimize the
network and enhance preparedness and
response capacity in this respect.

Results and achievements
UNHCR delivered $668 million to 9.3 million
people in over 100 countries, including
in challenging emergencies such as
Afghanistan, the Democratic Republic of
the Congo and Yemen. Cash is an efficient
tool to respond to immediate life-saving
and basic needs, as well as a way to foster
resilience and unlock the potential for
sustainable inclusion.

Post-distribution monitoring was conducted
in 60 countries. The global Post-Distribution

assistance was effective in responding to
people’s needs and improving their overall
well-being. Markets largely remained
functional despite the global challenges
posed by the pandemic, and cash was the
preferred way of providing and receiving
assistance. 95% of people surveyed for the

of concern, linked cash to social protection
and leveraged UNHCR’s protection
expertise in the delivery of cash, issuing
guidance on “Cash assistance and access
to formal financial services” and “Cash
assistance and protection: why, what and
how?” UNHCR continued implementing
the High Commissioner’s commitment
to collaborative cash arrangements
under the UN Common Cash Statement,
with common cash arrangements in
25 countries. UNHCR held a multi-country
learning event, conducted a 20-country
survey to enhance common procurement,
and signed a trilateral Data Sharing
Agreement with WFP and UNICEF. UNHCR
also coordinated cash in refugee settings.
As an example of the versatility of cash
assistance, UNHCR used cash in Egypt to
shore up education of refugee children,
a form of assistance that could be easily
expanded when the pandemic brought
new challenges. Despite a high degree
of inclusion – Syrian, Sudanese, South
Sudanese and Yemeni refugees and asylum
seekers have access to public education
on the same level as Egyptian children –

In line with the Global Compact on
Refugees, 6 million people of concern
benefited from digital payments in
48 countries. 25% had access to fully
owned bank accounts or mobile money
accounts, which is a pathway towards
financial inclusion. From 2020 to 2021,
an additional 26 countries started using
CashAssist (UNHCR’s cash management
system) enabling end-to-end accountability
to affected populations and ensuring an
efficient response.
UNHCR’s “Policy on cash-based
interventions 2022-2026” focuses on
increasing cash in emergencies, cash to
improve protection and cash that promotes
inclusion and access to local services in a
sustainable manner. UNHCR will also invest
in efficient and inclusive coordination of
cash-based interventions across operations.

In 2021 post-distribution monitoring, 95% of
the respondents in 44 countries reported
that cash assistance had improved their
living conditions and helped reduce feelings
of stress. However, the results also pointed
to major gaps in meeting immediate basic
needs. 73% of households reported being
able to cover only half their immediate basic
needs or less.
During 2021, UNHCR disbursed
$668 million in cash assistance globally,
95% of it unrestricted in its use. Recipients
of unrestricted cash assistance are
empowered to choose how to meet their
basic needs as per their individual priorities.
Global data showed cash recipients
used unrestricted cash for basic needs,
such as food (88%) or hygiene items
(40%) or rent (35%). This breakdown of
spending, reflecting a hierarchy of needs,
demonstrates that recipients of cash
assistance are empowered to prioritize.
That power of choice is achieved by
unearmarked funding, demonstrating
why UNHCR advocates so strongly for
cash assistance.

Primary health care information for
refugees living in camps and settlements
was collected using UNHCR’s integrated
refugee health information systems and
District Health information Software.
Globally, 7,620,115 outpatient consultations
were reported in 155 sites in 22 countries.
Despite the pandemic, health facility
utilization remained relatively stable at
1.5 visits per refugee per year. Upper
respiratory tract infections (23%), malaria
(19%), lower respiratory tract infections
(7%), watery diarrhoea (5%) and noncommunicable diseases (5%) were the
top five causes of morbidity in 2021.
Under-five mortality was similar to 2020.
UNHCR supported referrals to secondary
or tertiary care in 41 countries, with
274,348 referrals. The largest referral
programme was in Lebanon, with more

than 62,000 referrals, mainly for obstetric
and neonatal care.
UNHCR funded malaria control activities
such as distributing insecticide-treated nets
and indoor spraying in 17 countries and
supported 4,396 male and 4,389 female
community health workers in 41 countries.
UNHCR’s approach to ensuring equitable
access to health care prioritizes the
inclusion of refugees in national policies,
strategies, plans and health systems.
UNHCR surveyed inclusion in 51 countries,
and in March 2021 preliminary results from
46 countries showed 41 had a national
health plan or policy, of which 78% included
or covered refugees, up from 68% in
2019. In two countries, refugees were
not included or explicitly excluded. All 46
granted refugees access to national primary
health care facilities, and 45 reported
access to national secondary health care
facilities. This access was under the same
conditions as nationals in 43 countries
(93%) for primary health care and 38 (83%)
for secondary health care, a slight increase
from 2019 (92% and 77% respectively). 57%
of countries had a national health insurance
scheme and 38% included refugees,
compared to 27% in 2019.

UNHCR trained managers and clinical
providers, including Ministry of Health staff
and partners, in treatment and prevention
of non-communicable diseases. Regional
sessions reached trainers in the East and
Horn of Africa and the Great Lakes region
and in West and Central Africa.
UNHCR reinforced adolescent sexual
and reproductive health programming in
refugee settings in sub-Saharan Africa
and beyond, and 30 operations supported
programmes to improve services for
refugee youth and adolescents, including
training health providers and community
promoters.
Efforts to save maternal and newborn lives
included a three-year project for lowcost, high-impact interventions among
772,000 refugees in Cameroon, Chad
and Niger, with 33,530 births. The project,
finalized in 2021, cut neonatal mortality by
25% and sharply improved statistics for very
low birth weight and for fatalities among
newborns with complications.

Efforts to advance inclusion and integration
into national health systems faced challenges
in low-income settings. In real terms health
expenditure has fallen in many refugeehosting countries over recent years, falling
far short of the WHO’s recommended annual
threshold of $86 per capita for a minimum set
of cost-effective health interventions in lowincome countries. In many countries external
donors provide the majority of resources
in the health sector and public funding has
decreased, resulting in higher household
health costs. Medium- and longer-term
support to the health sector, including by
development actors, would enhance efforts
toward sustainable integration.
Funding gaps meant a lack of support
for malaria prevention in some locations,
leading to higher rates of sickness and
increased mortality due to malaria. Funding
shortfalls also meant health facilities did
not get vital upgrades such as solar panels
and sanitation improvements. Of 358 health
facilities surveyed in 2021, 13% had no
energy supply and 41% had energy supplies
that needed immediate improvement,
with environmental and operational costs.
A survey of 233 health clinics for daytime
consultations found 45% had no toilet
available for people visiting a doctor and
26% had inadequate sanitation facilities.

Conflict is estimated to triple the prevalence
of mental health conditions among adults,
and while there is no generally accepted
estimate for children, it is clear that the
experience of surviving conflict, being
forced to flee and living in protracted
displacement all cause high levels of mental
health issues. In March 2021, UNHCR
published “Strengthening mental health and
psychosocial support in 2021” describing
the approach it takes.
UNHCR integrates mental health into its
work to support public health programmes,
training health workers to identify and
manage mental health conditions. In 2021,
1,683 primary health care staff in refugee
settings in 19 countries were trained with
the “mhGAP Humanitarian Intervention
Guide” published by WHO and UNHCR.
78% of training sessions were in camps or
rural settlements and 69% were funded
by UNHCR.
To ensure adequate care for people
with complex and severe mental health
conditions, UNHCR aims to have at least
one mental health specialist available
per 25,000 refugees in contexts where

it supports public health programmes.
In 2021, 59 of 69 camps with more than
25,000 inhabitants had a mental health
professional, typically a psychiatric nurse
or a clinical psychologist.
In Rwanda, for example, UNHCR funded
mental health training for nurses and
midwives from all refugee settings, led by a
mental health professional from a Rwandan
university teaching hospital and a Rwandan
psychiatric nurse working in one of the
camps who had completed an intensive
online training and mentoring programme
run by International Medical Corps, with the
collaboration of WHO and UNHCR.
UNHCR promotes the use of brief,
structured, evidence-based psychological
therapies such as Problem Management Plus
or Interpersonal Therapy for Depression.
In 2021, 656 psychologists, social workers
and refugee volunteers in 11 countries were
trained in such methods. In 25 countries,
UNHCR and partners trained a total of
1,499 community health volunteers (most of
them refugees) in psychological first aid and
basic psychosocial skills.
In Peru, 16 psychologists and social workers

Multisectoral suicide prevention task forces
were set up in Bangladesh (Cox’s Bazar),
Kenya (Kakuma), and Uganda, galvanizing
collaboration to reduce the incidence
of suicidal behaviour. UNHCR drafted
a guidance document, “Planning for
prevention and risk mitigation of suicide in
refugee settings: a toolkit for multisectoral
action” and improved it with expert review
and input, for release in 2022.
In Bangladesh, Iraq, Kenya and Lebanon,
UNHCR and partners trained and supervised
community structures (outreach volunteers,
community committees, volunteers in
community centres) in basic psychosocial
skills and identification and referral.
Families and caregivers are critical to
children’s safety and well-being. To help
them protect and care for children, UNHCR
provides practical and psychosocial support
for caregivers, offers legal counselling and
support for families, and helps families to
meet their basic needs.
UNHCR’s standby partner Dutch Surge
Support deployed experts in mental health
and psychosocial support (MHPSS) to
Chad, Kenya and Sudan in 2021, while
UNHCR recruited international MHPSS
experts to support its work in Ethiopia
and Uganda. To boost in-house expertise,
34 staff in 16 countries completed a 75-hour
course entitled “Mental health in complex
emergencies”, organized in cooperation
with Fordham University in New York.

Challenges and unmet needs
In 2021, waves of COVID-19 continued to
trigger lockdowns, hampering access to
services, battering socioeconomic systems,
and putting further strain on the mental health
and psychosocial well-being of refugees and
stateless persons. Many refugee-hosting
countries lack a strong national system for
mental health and psychosocial support, and
referral options were therefore limited.
People displaced within their own country
also have a great need for mental health
and psychosocial support services, which
is rarely met. The Global Protection Cluster
has recognized this and will prioritize
the integration of MHPSS into protection
responses. Because MHPSS is multisectoral
it is important to set up technical working
groups for MHPSS where specialists from
different sectors can share experiences and
develop common approaches.

2020 result: improvement in

Results and achievements
Gender-based violence is a serious and
under-reported human rights violation.
Estimates suggest 1 in 5 forcibly displaced
women is subjected to sexual violence, and
displacement may bring a 20% higher risk of
intimate partner violence. In 2021, genderbased violence was a major feature of
conflicts, including those in the Democratic
Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia and
Mozambique, and acted as a primary driver
of displacement in northern Central America.
UNHCR implemented its “Policy on
the prevention of, risk mitigation, and
response to gender-based violence”
globally through learning initiatives such
as online courses and in-person training.
A provisional monitoring framework was
also released.

176 UNHCR GLOBAL REPORT 2021

74% of UNHCR operations (96 of 130)
reported that gender-based violence
services were available to survivors in
the context of COVID-19. Operations
expanded mobile and remote service
provision (including 24/7 hotlines) and
updated referral pathways. Survivors
were supported with psychosocial,
health, security and legal services as
well as cash assistance. Safe spaces for
women and girls in India, Sudan and the
Americas helped to establish trust and
empower forcibly displaced women and
girls. As a result, more survivors sought
help, while timely support contributed to
reducing risks of further violence such
as child marriage and trafficking for the
purpose of sexual exploitation. A total of
89,742 survivors received psychosocial
counselling, 4,066 received legal
assistance and 3,845 medical assistance.

UNHCR strengthened its engagement with
governments and civil society, in particular
women-led organizations. In Mali, a One
Stop Centre providing critical care and
support to survivors and people at risk of
gender-based violence was handed over
by UNHCR to the authorities. UNHCR’s
Innovation Award focused on women-led
organizations, garnering interest from over
480 organizations.
UNHCR’s efforts to mainstream genderbased violence risk mitigation across
sectors included safety audits (in Central
African Republic, Ethiopia and Mozambique)
and practical interventions. Responding
to recommendations from women and
girls, UNHCR installed solar lighting in
Somalia and distributed solar lamps to
15,000 Yemeni women and girls living in
informal IDP settlements. In collaboration
with the local women’s association, a
sustainable community-based women-led
structure, a grinding mill was built in Tsore
refugee camp in Ethiopia, empowering the
women who run the mill and mitigating risks
for women and girls who previously walked
long distances to grinding facilities.
UNHCR and its partners implemented
gender-based violence prevention
programming, including the “Engaging
men in accountable practices” (EMAP)
programme in Kenya, Rwanda, South
Sudan, Uganda, the United Republic of
Tanzania and Zimbabwe, and SASA! (Start,
Awareness, Support, Action) in Bangladesh,

Ethiopia, South Sudan and Uganda. For
example, 105 young men who completed
the programme in Zimbabwe in the last
quarter of 2021 pledged to eradicate
gender-based violence within their
communities.
International Women’s Day and 16 Days of
Activism helped UNHCR to raise awareness
about services and mobilize action.
UNHCR also supported research, including
“Safer asylum – an analysis of genderrelated persecution and child asylum claims
in Europe”.

23 displacement situations
saw improved community
involvement in prevention
and protection of
gender-based violence.
2020 result: improvement in
21 displacement situations.

648 UNHCR staff completed at least
one level of e-learning on gender-based
violence, and 88% said the training would
have a positive impact on their work with
forcibly displaced people.

Challenges and unmet needs
The pandemic put women and girls at
greater risk and hampered the delivery
of and access to gender-based violence
services, obliging UNHCR to work partly
remotely and through extended community
networks. Perpetrators’ impunity, due to
weak legal frameworks and application
of the law, impeded survivors’ access to
justice. Gaps in gender-based violence
response by law enforcement and other
service providers in some locations
increased risks of further violence for
survivors. Services for male and LGBTIQ+
survivors were scarce. Long-term structural
efforts to address gender inequality, the
root cause of gender-based violence, are
essential but often deprioritized amid urgent
response needs. Lack of documentation
and statelessness were also risk factors.
In 2021, UNHCR’s identified gender-based
violence needs were only 44% funded,
severely hampering the ability of UNHCR to
effectively prevent, mitigate and respond to
gender-based violence.

People forced to flee face heightened
risks of malnutrition and hunger, both in
new emergencies as well as in protracted
situations of displacement. In 2021, UNHCR
supported the management of acute
malnutrition, prevention of undernutrition
and micronutrient deficiencies, and
explored innovation and context-specific
interventions to improve food security and
the nutrition status of refugees.
Support for the management of acute
malnutrition reached 71,695 children aged

package to support this programme.
After an interruption in 2020 caused by
COVID-19, UNHCR resumed Standardized
Expanded Nutrition Surveys to assess
malnutrition levels in 93 sites across
13 countries. Alarmingly, 33% of these sites
had a serious global acute malnutrition
prevalence, and 14% were above the
emergency threshold of 15% prevalence.
Stunting amongst children aged

practices on UNHCR-WFP collaboration for
dissemination in webinars, technical briefing

Challenges and unmet needs
Refugee food security is a growing concern
due to the combined impact of reduced
humanitarian funding, climate change, the
economic impact of COVID-19 (restrictions
on movement, job losses, limited access to
safety nets), and limited legal access to
employment opportunities. In 2021, funding
shortfalls forced cuts to refugee food and
basic needs assistance in 15 countries. In
Cameroon, Chad and South Sudan a 50%
food ration was provided which only met
half the minimum recommended calories.
In Kenya, Uganda and the United Republic
of Tanzania, the ration cuts ranged from
30 to 40%. Adequate food is necessary
to contribute to optimal nutritional status.
To ensure the most vulnerable are targeted
or prioritized for assistance, UNHCR and
WFP worked together in several countries
to jointly assess and analyse vulnerability
and design protection-sensitive targeting/
prioritization strategies. Robust communication
with communities and complaints and appeals
mechanisms supported these processes.
A key constraint was limited capacity at
country level to support this assessment,
analysis and targeting of assistance.

UNHCR built sanitation facilities, drilled
boreholes and promoted good hygiene to

Data from UNHCR’s innovative RealTime Monitoring (RTM) can help optimize
WASH infrastructure, saving water and
money. In 2021, a frame agreement was
established and UNHCR used its 1 million
euro EU Horizon Prize to expand RTM
in several operations. To tackle complex
technical problems, UNHCR created the
Geneva Technical Hub (GTH) with the
Swiss Agency for Development and
Cooperation in 2021. Its expertise helped
address a challenging sanitation situation
during a hepatitis E outbreak in Sudan,
as well as benefiting Bangladesh, Chad,
Malawi, Zambia and Zimbabwe. The GTH
and UNHCR’s rapid groundwater potential
mapping were used in 13 refugee sites to
increase the probability of boreholes finding
water and the productivity of finalized wells,
while an innovative project to develop
improved latrine slabs for emergencies
was finalized with support from the Bill
and Melinda Gates Foundation. The new
design reduces environmental health
risks by blocking flies from leaving latrine
pits and increases user satisfaction by
reducing odours and flies. Nearly 3,000 of
the improved slabs are being procured for
Sudan (2,700), Uganda (120), and Nigeria
(100) using recycled plastic. 370 of the slabs
are designed for people with disabilities.

COVID-19, climate change and conflict
continued posing risks and challenges to
operations and forcibly displaced people
and host communities. Besides the direct
health risks, COVID 19 caused supply
chain disruptions that led to delays in
implementation. Climate-related hazards
are expected to grow in frequency and
severity, and more preparedness is required
from UNHCR’s operations to protect
people of concern from the potential
consequences and to maintain functional
WASH services. Accessibility remains a
challenge, as many operations are remote
and affected by conflict, further aggravating
the operational conditions. Building on
the 2021 achievements to respond to
these challenges and in line with UNHCR’s
“Strategic framework for climate action”,
UNHCR and partners will focus on building
the resilience of operations and people of
concern by incorporating climate change
mitigation, adaptation and environmental
mainstreaming into WASH responses.

Environmental considerations are at the
forefront of shelter interventions. In Yemen,
UNHCR and local partner Jeel Albena
teamed up to respond to shelter needs in
Hudaydah and Hajjah, home to over 25% of
the country’s IDPs. Local materials such as
reed mats and mud were incorporated into
redesigned shelters, known as the Tehama
emergency shelter kit, which can be easily
converted into longer-term housing units.
In addition to supporting local livelihoods,
this shelter solution reduces CO2 emissions
from international transport, storage and
distribution.

COVID-19 response.
Target: 1.6 million people living
in 55 sites in 11 operations
2020 result: 1.61 million people
in 21 sites in 13 operations.

Results and achievements
UNHCR operations mobilized to meet the
emergency, transitional and durable shelter
and settlement needs of people of concern
in 2021. In addition to its response to rapidly
escalating emergencies in Afghanistan and
Ethiopia, UNHCR also provided shelter in
IDP priority countries: Burkina Faso, the
Democratic Republic of the Congo, Iraq
and the Syrian Arab Republic. In Myanmar,
UNHCR assisted in constructing over
188 sustainable shelters and planning an
additional 143. In addition to supporting site
planning, combined shelter and settlement
initiatives benefited over 133,300 Rohingya
and Kaman stateless people. While
COVID-19 imposed major constraints,
ultimately over 318,500 people of concern
benefited from improved shelter in 2021.
In April 2021, UNHCR published “Shelter
and sustainability”, offering a comparative
overview of the technical performance,

182 UNHCR GLOBAL REPORT 2021

habitability, affordability and environmental
impact of shelter designs, and outlining
the real costs of shelter interventions.
In 2021, this guidance was implemented
in Boa Vista, Brazil, where UNHCR’s
emergency shelter response focused on
site management, technical guidance and
coordination, serving 8,100 people.
In keeping with UNHCR’s “Operational
strategy for climate resilience and
environmental sustainability 20222025”, new eco-friendly specifications
and technical processes were applied
in designing UNHCR’s standard and
multipurpose sleeping mats. 90% less
water is used in making recycled mats
versus mats from virgin materials,
saving 15.3 litres of water per mat during
production. The sustainability of refugee
housing units in six operations was
analysed, with additional work carried out
to improve the generic refugee housing
unit using local materials.

UNHCR published an operational
guidance note on “Technical monitoring
of construction works in the shelter and
housing sector” and completed the Shelter
and Settlement Assessment Toolkit
(SSAT). The SSAT enables monitoring and
comparison of intervention performances
across response types and locations, and
provides tools for operations to conduct
assessments and gather data.
In 2021, UNHCR provided contextspecific guidance to support emergency
and protracted settlements through
geospatial and hydrological site analyses in
collaboration with UNITAR. These initiatives
were undertaken in 27 settlements in
15 countries, benefiting over 1.65 million
people of concern.
UNHCR’s “Master plan approach to
settlement planning: guiding principles” is
a key reference when defining a settlement
response. This approach was further
operationalized through interventions that
began in 2020. In Kouchanguine-Moura,
in Chad’s Ouaddai province, for example,
multisectoral assessments were carried
out to inform site selection, including
buffer zones around seasonal streams to
avoid flooding, and the design of green
spaces, among other key environmental
considerations.

Following successful collaboration with
UN-Habitat on settlement profiling,
an analysis framework for settlements
accommodating displaced populations,
the approach was scaled up to operations
in 2021 including in Qoloji, located in the
Somali region of Ethiopia, with the potential
to benefit almost 80,000 people.
Under the initiative of the Geneva Technical
Hub, collaborations were initiated that
resulted in the planning and support
of site plans and block organization for
three settlements in Niatak, Taybad and
Sefid Sang in the Islamic Republic of Iran,
potentially hosting up to 11,000 people.

While UNHCR is working consistently to
improve shelter, lack of funding means
that forcibly displaced people may stay
for many years in tents or sub-standard
living conditions. It is also harder to find
more environmentally responsible and
sustainable solutions for housing. In urban
areas, people may have to move out
of rental apartments or live in less safe
neighbourhoods.
COVID-19, climate change and conflict
continued to pose risks and challenges
to operations and people of concern,
causing challenges in finding appropriate
shelter solutions. Adapting to a rapidly
changing global environment will be a
major challenge: settlements for the forcibly
displaced will need to adapt to provide a
healthy living environment and shelters will
need to be upgraded to withstand extreme
climate events such as cyclones, droughts
and heat waves.

THEMATIC CHAPTERS I BUILDING BETTER FUTURES

UNHCR worked with States and partners
to apply a whole-of-society, progressive
approach to solutions in 2021. This
emphasizes seeking solutions from the
outset of a displacement situation, with a
shift towards greater inclusion and selfreliance, and contributing to host country
economies. This approach prepares
refugees for their futures as they pursue
durable solutions through voluntary
repatriation and reintegration in countries
of origin, resettlement and complementary
pathways for admission to third countries,
or solutions in countries of asylum. A
greater focus on self-reliance can reinforce
protection and dignity, and expanding
opportunities for self-reliance and resilience
among the forcibly displaced and their
hosts contributes to the development of
markets, leads to better services in remote
areas, and supports social cohesion.
The pandemic exacerbated existing
humanitarian challenges and further
disadvantaged forcibly displaced
and stateless people, who were
disproportionally affected by its
socioeconomic consequences in many
countries. UNHCR’s work to deliver
education, livelihoods and access to energy
was crucial to promoting the well-being of
refugees and their host communities. In
line with the Global Compact on Refugees,
UNHCR also further strengthened its
partnerships with major development actors
and multilateral development banks.

In 2021, UNHCR advocated for the
development of favourable laws, policies
and practices and supported their
implementation, leading to increased
socioeconomic inclusion and the
establishment of residency in some
contexts.
Voluntary repatriation has slowed overall
since 2015. Barriers to return remain in
many countries of origin. These include
ongoing conflict, persistent insecurity,
failure to address root causes, destruction
and confiscation of housing, land and
property, severely overburdened or absent
services in countries of origin, and lack of
viable livelihoods. UNHCR promotes all
viable prospects for creating conditions
conducive to return, working closely
with peace and development actors to
remove barriers and make return more
sustainable. In 2021, the availability of
third country solutions remained limited.
However, heightened interest and support
for education pathways and labour mobility
are apparent. UNHCR works with States
and partners to adapt to the risks and
restrictions brought by the pandemic, whilst
advocating for increased resettlement
quotas.

In 2021, UNHCR strengthened its
partnerships with development actors.
It collaborated with the World Bank on
the design of $2.6 billion investments
supporting 46 World Bank operations in
14 low-income countries that host refugees.
It supported the design and development
of projects financed by the IDA18 Refugee
Sub Window and IDA19 Window for
Host Communities and Refugees and
strengthened its engagement with the
Global Concessional Financing Facility
(GCFF), providing protection and policy
analyses for eligible countries. To date, the
GCFF has financed 21 operations totalling
$671 million in grants and $4.9 billion in
loans in four middle-income countries
hosting refugees.
UNHCR worked closely with the African
Development Bank (AfDB) – implementing
AfDB-funded projects, advocating for the
inclusion of forcibly displaced and stateless
people in AfDB’s regular programmes,
and participating in consultations on the
development of AfDB’s new “Strategy
for addressing fragility and building
resilience in Africa” to ensure that forced
displacement features as a cross-cutting
theme. UNHCR signed a memorandum
of understanding with the Inter-American
Development Bank and took a step towards
strategic collaboration with the Asian
Development Bank (ADB) by agreeing on
a streamlined process for refugee-related
projects financed through the ADB’s
Expanded Disaster and Pandemic Response
Facility (DRF+). Collaboration also increased

Migration and Forced Displacement.
A jointly organized event assessed two
years of MDB engagement in situations of
forced displacement, resulting in a UNHCR
stocktaking report.
Partnerships with bilateral development
actors including AFD, BMZ, INTPA and JICA
were deepened and further systematized.
New partnerships were built in specific
sectors and geographies with Enabel,
Norad and SIDA. UNHCR worked with JICA
on its engagement in refugee responses
in Bangladesh, Jordan, Türkiye, Uganda
and Zambia. The UNHCR-BMZ partnership
continued to develop within and beyond
the Global Programme jointly implemented
by GIZ and UNHCR. Cooperation in sectors
such as energy and technical and vocational
education and training was strengthened,
and expanded to include countries affected
by the Afghanistan crisis. UNHCR worked
with regional and country-level counterparts
to inform the EU’s 2021-2027 development
programming, particularly on the regional
programme in sub-Saharan Africa.
Partnerships with donor countries including
Denmark, Luxembourg and the Netherlands
were also strengthened, including through
the Prospects Partnership – a coalition
of humanitarian and development actors
funded by the latter.
UNHCR and UNDP worked towards the
launch of a global joint initiative on resilience
and solutions, lending new impetus to
the next phase of the UNDP-UNHCR

Key partnerships, engagement with
development actors and processes

Research, data and analytics on socioeconomic data and
host communities
The pandemic’s impact on health, mobility, businesses and schools
significantly eroded economic well-being and the resilience of
vulnerable groups, including people of concern to UNHCR. This
underscored the need for timely socioeconomic data on the
conditions experienced by forcibly displaced and stateless people
and their hosts in order to plan strategies that target specific vulnerabilities and uplift refugees and
host communities alike. Socioeconomic data is rapidly gaining traction as an indispensable input
into UNHCR’s responses. Recent examples include a transformative area-based approach with local
government for Kenya’s Kalobeyei integrated settlement, targeted assistance in Chad, Lebanon and
Niger, and a targeted relocation programme led by the Government of Brazil to improve integration
opportunities for Venezuelans displaced abroad. UNHCR, the World Bank and the Joint Data Center
worked closely to include forcibly displaced and stateless people in high-frequency phone surveys
on the socioeconomic impact of COVID-19. The World Bank and UNHCR have tracked the pandemic’s
impact on access to health and education services, employment and food security for forcibly displaced
and stateless in 10 countries – Bangladesh, Chad, Costa Rica, Djibouti, Ethiopia, Kenya, Iraq, Mexico,
Uganda and Yemen.
Socioeconomic data collected by UNHCR, the World Bank, governments and partners make it clear
that weak economic environments disproportionately affect displaced people. Phone survey data
shows the pandemic deepening pre-existing inequalities between forcibly displaced and non-displaced
populations. More forcibly displaced people are unemployed and an overwhelming percentage struggle
with reduced family income, often resorting to skipping meals to cope. In Uganda and Kenya in both
2020 and 2021, nationals returned to full employment while refugee employment trailed below prepandemic levels. In Costa Rica, nearly 75% of displaced people surveyed reported family income below
pre-pandemic times.
UNHCR initiated work towards an integrated survey series that will deliver on the majority of the
organization’s survey data needs. The guiding principles for the development of the survey instruments
are international statistical standards and international survey best practices, akin to those used by the
World Bank, UNICEF, ILO and others. This will ensure the comparability of the evidence from this survey
series with existing national and international data series. The initial focus of the country pilots is on
refugees and host communities.
Predicting displacement movements using data science techniques and advanced technologies has
become increasingly important to inform programming and planning. To support operations in generating
population projections, a newly established data science team in UNHCR’s Global Data Service
developed an empirical gravity model as a basis to predict future refugee flows and help guide UNHCR’s
multi-year planning projections. UNHCR also examined “big data” as an alternative data source for
predictive models, publishing a review of the literature on “Big (crisis) data for predictive models”.
UNHCR continued to host the Secretariat of the Expert Group on Refugee, IDP and Statelessness
Statistics (EGRISS), with members drawn from 45 national authorities and 25 regional and international
organizations. Since the endorsement of the International Recommendations on Refugee and Internally
Displaced Persons Statistics, the EGRISS Secretariat has been monitoring their implementation at
national, regional and global levels. Over 100 examples of planned, ongoing or completed initiatives
have been identified and documented in its first ever “Annual Report 2020-2021: Improving statistics
on forced displacement and statelessness during a global pandemic”.

“Connected education for refugees:
addressing the digital divide” and launched
the Refugee Connected Education
Challenge at the High-Level Officials
Meeting in Geneva and the RewirED Summit
in Dubai. The Challenge aims to mobilize
further commitments and partnerships for
ensuring greater investments in protective
digital initiatives that meaningfully include
displaced communities. UNHCR made
strong efforts to highlight the needs of
refugees within global digital learning
initiatives. In partnership with Vodafone

UNHCR dramatically increased its ability
to analyse refugees’ access to education
in 2021, with more than 40 operations
reporting education data, up from 12 in
2020. UNHCR also collected information
on policy and legislation on refugee
education access in more than
90 countries. The data fed into education
advocacy efforts and publications such
as the “Education report 2021: staying
the course”, “Connected education for
refugees: addressing the digital divide”
and the “Global Compact on Refugees
indicator report”.
Evidence and research activities included
the evaluation of some of UNHCR’s
education programmes – the Albert Einstein
German Academic Refugee Initiative (the
DAFI programme), Instant Network Schools
and the Humanitarian Education Accelerator
– as well as a project for strengthening data
management systems in four countries with
different degrees of inclusion and a new

a programme of the Education Above All Foundation supported
by the Qatar Fund for Development. This provides access to
education for displaced children who are out of school across
15 operations in Africa, the Americas, Asia and the Middle East.
The programme adopts a holistic approach to tackling the
numerous educational barriers that out-of-school children face. By supporting a range of interventions,
such as improving the school environment, building teachers’ capacities, providing learning materials and
meeting the specific needs of marginalized children, UNHCR and Educate A Child have been able
to increase the enrolment and retention of displaced children in primary education.

In 2021, UNHCR allocated $140.6 million
for livelihoods and economic inclusion
activities. That included $13.6 million
to mitigate the impact of COVID-19,
more than triple the 2020 figure. The
sum for COVID-19 mitigation supported
activities in 30 countries, with the largest
allocations in Burkina Faso, Cameroon
and Chad. UNHCR also provided support
for specific interventions such as poverty
reduction through the “graduation
approach”, artisanal production through
the MADE51 model, business creation and
asset transfers, and financial inclusion
facilitation. It also developed training on
livelihoods and economic inclusion for
emergency preparedness for Angola. Over
11,000 forcibly displaced people in over
75 countries enrolled in UNHCR learning on
the Coursera for Refugees platform, a 27%

35 countries by 2025 through increasing
self-reliance, with a shorter goal of ending
extreme poverty for 160,000 households
by the end of 2023. Through the PAC, and
using the graduation approach, UNHCR and
partners provided self-reliance support to
60,000 extremely poor refugee and host
community households by the end of 2021.
Civil society, together with UN agencies,
governments and other actors, worked
together to scale up the graduation
approach by accelerating country coalition

Results and achievements

UNHCR and ILO conducted joint
assessments in Aruba, Curacao, Ecuador,
Egypt and Nepal and commissioned a joint
assessment of market-based programming
in refugee contexts as part of joint
collaboration on the Approach to Inclusive
Market Systems.

Challenges and unmet needs
The UNHCR livelihoods and economic
inclusion global survey revealed that in
2021, 62% of refugees lived in countries
with restricted access in practice to formal
employment, 59% lived in countries with
restricted access in practice to registering and
operating a business, and 66% had restricted
rights to access land for agriculture. 56% of
refugees lived in countries where refugee
ID is not legally recognized to open a bank
account. The impact of the pandemic was
acutely felt by forcibly displaced and stateless
people, with some data showing that they
lagged behind their national counterparts in
recovering from the economic shock.
Limited resources hindered UNHCR’s
ability to offer the tailored support that
is often required for a particular country,
such as value chain analysis, market
studies, mapping of scalable employment
interventions, expansion of the graduation
approach and innovative, climate-smart
agricultural practices. There was also limited
availability of quality socioeconomic data and
evidence, which affected programme design,
implementation, monitoring, advocacy and
strategic partnership development.

WEYU empowers refugees through blockchain
technology
WEYU, a platform for non-fungible tokens (NFTs),
partnered with UNHCR to empower refugees in Georgia through
blockchain technology. Three artworks were digitized and broken
up into 6,075 individual pieces. Using an online paint platform,
each part was re-created by refugees who digitally hand-drew
each piece and were paid on the blockchain for their work.
The pieces were sold as NFTs and raised the equivalent of nearly $300,000, which was donated to
support UNHCR’s work in Georgia and global programmes in livelihoods, education, shelter, protection
and health. The project showcases how UNHCR can leverage blockchain technology to help create
opportunities for a better future for people forced to flee.

In 2021, UNHCR worked to improve access
to sustainable and clean energy for forcibly
displaced and stateless people and to
boost environmental protection in refugeehosting areas.
By strengthening collaboration with
partner organizations, UNHCR enhanced
the technical expertise available to
support access to energy. For example,
NORCAP deployed nine energy experts
in eight UNHCR operations, supporting
assessments and implementation of
sustainable energy access programmes
with direct impact on refugees and their
hosts. The Geneva Technical Hub, in
collaboration with the Swiss Agency for
Development and Cooperation, deployed
two experts to help solve complex technical
energy challenges. In Kenya, for example,
an expert installed energy meters to
support the conversion of diesel generators
to renewable energy.

192 UNHCR GLOBAL REPORT 2021

UNHCR provided access to fuels and stoves
to people of concern in 18 countries, helping
with daily cooking needs, with adaptations
to take account of local cultural preferences,
existing resources and environmental
considerations. Progress towards cleaner
cooking, which reduces emissions and
reduces health risks, was made in Algeria,
Angola, Bangladesh, Burkina Faso,
Ethiopia, Kenya, Niger, Rwanda and
Uganda, mostly by adopting liquified
petroleum gas. In Bangladesh, for example,
UNHCR and partners provided nearly
100% of refugees and about 14,000 host
community households with clean fuel and
technology for cooking, while supporting
reforestation activities. In Jordan, 44% of
refugees reported having used cash for
utilities to satisfy their energy needs.
3,789 hectares of degraded land were
rehabilitated through reforestation activities
in refugee-hosting areas. About 3.8 million
trees were planted in Chad, Cameroon,

Within the ESDS (Energy Solutions for
Displacement Settings) programme, in
partnership with GIZ and as part of the
COVID-19 response, local and national
authorities in Uganda were supported
with the solarization of six health centres,
providing them with electricity 24 hours a
day. The quality of basic services greatly
improved for 60,000 refugees and over
10,000 local people. In Kenya, a renewable
energy system scale-up programme started,
led by UNHCR, with the potential to provide
31 schools and seven health facilities
improved access to electricity, benefiting up
to 69,000 students and 150,000 patients.
Following advocacy by UNHCR, the
African Development Bank approved the
$80 million Mozambique Energy for All
programme to enhance Mozambique’s
power exports, improve power quality both
domestically and regionally and increase
the number of electricity connections
within the country. Within five years
the programme plans to connect nearly
49,000 households, supporting the
electrification of refugee and IDP settlement
areas in Nampula province.
To support its advocacy, UNHCR mapped
the energy programmes of the major
development actors and international
financial institutions in 25 refugee-hosting
countries, a significant milestone on the
path towards greater inclusion of refugees
in energy development programmes.

Challenges and unmet needs
UNHCR estimates 20-25 million trees are
cut down in and around refugee settlements
each year. 90% of this deforestation is
driven by the urgent need for cooking fuel.
As the wood collection perimeter widens
with deforestation, women and children
must travel further to collect wood, putting
them at increased risk of gender-based
violence.

3,789

hectares of
degraded land were
rehabilitated through
reforestation activities in
refugee-hosting areas.
Target: 5,000 hectares
2020 result: 3,000 hectares

Underfunding has hindered UNHCR’s
efforts to meet the cooking needs of the
target population in an environmentally
sustainable way. UNHCR’s Refugee
Environmental Protection (REP) Fund
aims to invest in long-term reforestation
and clean cooking programmes in climatevulnerable refugee situations, generating
the first-ever large-scale refugee-produced
carbon credits.
Lack of infrastructure and limited rural
services mean communal facilities and
households do not have reliable electricity
supplies in most of the developing countries
hosting refugees. UNHCR plans to
strengthen its catalytic role and collaborate
with development actors, hosting
governments and other specialized partners
to mobilize sufficient resources for longterm investments in electricity for refugees
and their hosts.
Schools and health centres are often
powered by costly and polluting diesel
generators, if they have any access to
electricity at all. UNHCR is aiming to
transition away from diesel by solarizing
facilities that are currently powered by
diesel generators. To speed up this process,
UNHCR launched Project Flow, a revolving
fund that provides financial and technical
support for the design and installation of
renewable and hybrid systems, supporting
operations with limited technical capacity.
For more on the REP Fund and Project Flow,
please refer to the “Climate action” section
of the Global initiatives chapter.

UNHCR provided technical advice as a
strategic partner of the Mayors Migration
Council’s Global Cities Fund, an initiative
that provides financial assistance to cities
for COVID-19 and climate-related projects
supporting refugees, IDPs and migrants.
In 2021 grants were made to Barranquilla
and Medellín in Colombia; Lima, Peru;
Quito, Ecuador; Mexico City, Mexico; Beirut,
Lebanon; Freetown, Sierra Leone; Addis
Ababa, Ethiopia; and Kampala, Uganda.
UNHCR developed the municipalities toolkit
“Effective inclusion of refugees - Participatory
approaches for practitioners at the local
level” with the Migration Policy Group and in
collaboration with local authorities, service
providers, civil society and refugee-led
organizations across Europe. It was fieldtested in Bulgaria, Finland, Greece, Italy,
Malta, Poland and Serbia and tweaked
accordingly. The toolkit consists of a
step-by-step handbook, supporting videos
and assessment tools.

Home to over 1,800 families displaced due
to conflict in Ethiopia’s Somali region, Addis
Ababa’s Koyefeche settlement is an entry

support of the Mayors Migration Council’s
Global Cities Fund, to which UNHCR
is a strategic partner, the Addis Ababa
City Administration is connecting over
1,000 homes within Koyefeche to the city’s
primary potable water system and helping
40 residents of Koyefeche to establish
small businesses with seed funding and
micro-financing.

training programme in Kocaeli Metropolitan
Municipality where refugees gaining
industrial skills are registered by the
Turkish Employment Agency’s system and
enter the official job matching system in
Kocaeli province.

In Denver in the United States, the New
Americans Integration Network aims to
integrate immigrants and refugees into
the workforce while addressing economic
mobility barriers. Key are partnerships
that bridge communities through learning
and sharing as a part of the Immigrant
Integration Sponsorship grant programme
that, together with matching funds,
donations, and volunteers, contributed over
$100,000 for community-led events and
projects in 2021.

Challenges and unmet needs

UNHCR supported the Mayor’s Office in
Medellín, Colombia, to develop integration
centres (Centros de Integración-Integráte).
Tripartite alliances with the public and
private sectors of Medellín allow sustainable
socioeconomic integration for refugees
and migrants, including through training,
support for entrepreneurship and labour
inclusion. In coordination with UNHCR,
91 refugees and migrants completed the
“graduation approach”, a sequenced,
time-bound, participant-centred intervention
to get families out of poverty. UNHCR
expects to scale up this approach in
coordination with the Government.

Not enough information exists on barriers
to achieving inclusion and social cohesion
in cities. Cities also lack adequate data on
their refugee residents, which would help
to meet their needs and understand the
social and economic contribution made
by refugees. Refugees are not always
included in national and local development
or strategic plans, making it challenging
for local authorities to access funding
to expand services to meet the needs
of refugee residents. Many cities include
refugees, IDPs and migrants in their
existing services without adequate
financial resources.

support local solutions that the cities are
trying to achieve via their programmes

municipalities are included in planning and
empowered to participate in respective
policy-making forums would be key to
addressing these gaps.

UNHCR’s approach is to promote
government leadership and engage
development actors, civil society,
municipalities, the private sector and
academia in promoting and supporting
local integration and other local solutions.
In 2021, UNHCR, the Migration Policy
Group and integration stakeholders in
Bulgaria, Finland, Greece, Italy, Malta,
Poland, and Serbia developed a toolkit
for municipalities, helping local-level
practitioners to support inclusive initiatives.

strategies that take into account local
integration and other local solutions, such
as the Solutions Initiative for South Sudan
and Sudan, as well as the reactivation of
local working groups on integration in
Brazil. UNHCR and the International Council
of Voluntary Agencies published “Local
solutions for refugees: key considerations”.
UNHCR developed a comprehensive refugee
integration and inclusion strategy and multiyear action plan in Albania. A six-pillar Joint
Roadmap requested by the Government
of Kenya led to an ongoing discussion
to consider potential local solutions for
refugees. Following a regional agreement
on a roadmap for solutions for refugees
from Côte d’Ivoire, UNHCR published a
Comprehensive Solutions Strategy with
a three-pronged approach that included
advocating for permanent residency
status and/or facilitating naturalization and
socioeconomic inclusion for Ivorians opting
to stay in asylum countries.

UNHCR undertook capacity-building of
government agencies in Albania, Armenia
Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria,
Hungary, Macedonia, Mexico, Morocco
and elsewhere. This included helping
to facilitate access to information and
to develop, implement and coordinate
self-sufficiency strategies to support
the integration of refugees, including
inclusion/access to social protection
systems, housing programmes, the labour
market and public services, employment
opportunities/jobs and language training.
UNHCR also assisted government agencies
in issuing IDs to refugees to help them
access public services, legal assistance
and counselling. In Georgia, Guatemala and
Morocco, UNHCR supported information
campaigns and coexistence activities, while
in Niger it launched out-of-camp strategies
to promote integration opportunities and
social cohesion.

households hosted in Mauritania were
enrolled in the national social registry,
with 6,000 receiving cash transfers, whilst
4,500 vulnerable households were assisted
in the COVID-19 response through the
African Development Bank.
UNHCR’s advocacy and support to
governments and refugees also led to the
issuance of residence permits in Albania
and North Macedonia, and UNHCR assisted
the Government of Guinea-Bissau in
naturalizing around 7,000 refugees.

Challenges and unmet needs
The impact of COVID-19 and its
accompanying restrictions hampered the
implementation of plans and initiatives and
exacerbated the economic downturn. This
affected governments, companies, host
communities and others who might be in a
position to offer opportunities for refugees,
as well as refugees themselves. In some
instances, the complexity of governments’
internal coordination and communication
inhibited socioeconomic inclusion, and in
some situations, policy and legal restrictions
prevented legal local integration from
going ahead. Restrictions related to the
pandemic significantly affected the number
of advocacy events. More investment is
required to enable UNHCR to advocate with
governments and popularize the arguments
in favour of the local integration of refugees.

Bradesco Bank supports UNHCR in building
hope and promising futures for thousands
of forcibly displaced people
Since 2018, Bradesco Bank has been one of UNHCR’s top private
sector donors in Brazil. After a hiatus in 2020, Bradesco reiterated
its commitment to UNHCR and donated $200,000 in 2021. This
contribution was vital to assist more than 60,000 people in Brazil
who voluntarily relocated from the north of the country to other
cities, where they could build a more promising future. Globally, Bradesco Bank’s flexible funding is
critical to cover life-saving activities, especially during emergencies.

Results and achievements
The COVID-19 pandemic significantly
impacted the capacity to provide third
country solutions to refugees in need in
2021.
Despite COVID-19, UNHCR submitted
63,190 refugees to 23 countries for
resettlement, a 60% increase from 2020.
Most refugees submitted originated from
the Syrian Arab Republic (25,774), the
Democratic Republic of the Congo (13,121),
Eritrea (2,690), Sudan (2,599) and Somalia
(2,386). 39,300 refugees departed on
resettlement to 20 different countries, an
increase of 72% from 2020. 50% of the
submissions were women and girls, and
52% were children. 19% of the submissions
were made on an urgent or emergency
basis. The largest number of UNHCRfacilitated departures were from Türkiye
(7,382), Lebanon (6,246), Jordan (4,374),
Egypt (3,729) and Rwanda (2,506). Although
departures out of Libya were put on hold
for several months in 2021, 748 people
of concern to UNHCR were evacuated to
Emergency Transit Mechanisms in Niger
and Rwanda, and to Italy.

198 UNHCR GLOBAL REPORT 2021

UNHCR worked on data-sharing
agreements with several States and with
IOM. A new global resettlement submission
protocol was rolled out for data-sharing with
the United States of America, strengthening
integrity and identity management and
providing the necessary processing
efficiency for large-scale resettlement.
UNHCR and OECD launched a report
and dashboard examining a decade of
refugee admissions on family, study and
work permits, in the years 2010-2019.
Data on 2021 admissions will be available
towards the end of 2022. While indicative
numbers suggest that many refugees
benefited from work, study and family
permits, accurate data related to admission
through complementary pathways remains
a significant challenge for UNHCR, States
and other partners.

Challenges and unmet needs

The Sustainable Resettlement and
Complementary Pathways Initiative (CRISP)
supported States and stakeholders to
realize commitments under the Global
Compact on Refugees, with an update of
the “Integration handbook”, a key reference
text on the integration of resettled refugees,
and “Opportunities for Growth”, a report by
UNHCR and the Migration Policy Institute.
The CRISP also supported strategic
capacity-building aspects of Project GROW,
an initiative launched by UNHCR to improve
integration outcomes of refugees. The most
advanced GROW pilot was launched in
Argentina in 2021.

The Three-Year Strategy (2019-2021) target
of finding solutions for 240,000 refugees
through resettlement and complementary
pathways in 2021 was not met. Resettlement
quotas provided by States remained far
below the estimated needs of 1.45 million
refugees, with only 81,570 places allocated
for new submissions. Some States
redirected available resettlement places
to Afghan evacuations. While border and
travel restrictions were lifted, COVID-19
continued to hamper efficient internal and
external resettlement processing in several
key operations despite the piloting of
remote processing methods. The number
of departures, at 39,300, remained far
below the 80,000 target of the Three-Year
Strategy. Consequently, protection and
solutions were offered to less than 4.3% of
refugees in need of resettlement in 2021.
In addition, planned field visits by the
Priority Situations Core Group had to be
cancelled. Similarly, travel restrictions slowed
arrivals on complementary pathways, and
development and expansion of programmes.
Serious limitations on family reunifications
remained in place. Complementary pathways
advocacy efforts were further affected
by limitations in data and information
management systems related to admissions
which remain incomplete and indicative in
nature, both at UNHCR operational level and
within State systems.

returned to South Sudan, for a total of over
500,000 self-organized returns since 2017.
In response to the growth of self-organized
returns, UNHCR developed a solutionsoriented, area-based approach targeting
high return areas through investments in
medium- to long-term development and
peace interventions, called “Pockets of
hope,” to be piloted in 2022.

The crisis in Afghanistan hindered prospects
for voluntary repatriation, although
791,000 IDPs returned in the last four months
of the year. 1,400 Afghan refugees returned
home, with UNHCR assistance including
cash grants, COVID-19 vaccinations and
mine risk awareness training.

UNHCR supported returns
through provision of cash
assistance in accordance with
the guidance note as well as
legal assistance and
information.

Results and achievements
In the course of 2021, 429,000 refugees
returned to their country of origin —
an increase of 71% from 2020, with
more regular returns as COVID-related
restrictions eased and borders reopened.
In West and Central Africa, UNHCR
organized the repatriation of over
33,700 refugees, including 22,500 to
Côte d’Ivoire and 5,600 to the Central
African Republic (CAR). Since 2011,
278,000 Ivorian refugees have returned
home – 92% of those who had fled. In light
of the fundamental and durable changes
in Côte d’Ivoire, an “Updated regional
roadmap for comprehensive solutions
for Ivorian refugees” – adopted by the
Governments of Côte d’Ivoire, Ghana,
Guinea, Liberia, Mali, Mauritania and Togo
– aims to bring closure to the situation
in 2022. The Roadmap’s three-pronged
approach promotes voluntary repatriation
and effective reintegration; permanent
residency or naturalization for Ivorians
opting to stay; and the cessation of refugee
status but continued protection for those
unable to return. UNHCR recommended
cessation and supported the publication

of the recommendation in countries of
asylum, while offering technical support on
exemption procedures. Returnees receive
a cash grant to support their reintegration,
and UNHCR is working with the African
Development Bank on potential multiyear area-based support for returnee
communities. UNHCR also supports a
Government-led solution initiative for the
CAR situation and development of a solution
roadmap in 2022 that will mobilize collective
action and engage development actors.
Under the tripartite agreement between
Cameroon, Nigeria and UNHCR, nearly
4,000 refugees returned to Nigeria. UNHCR
initiated projects in return areas to protect
housing, land and property rights, facilitate
livelihoods opportunities and engage
development actors. 13,000 refugees
returned from the Democratic Republic
of the Congo (DRC) to Burundi and the
CAR in 2021. In Cameroon, the CAR and
Nigeria, almost 630,000 IDPs returned to
their places of origin. In the East and Horn
of Africa and the Great Lakes region, over
342,000 refugees returned home, including
66,000 Burundians who returned with
UNHCR’s assistance, compared to 40,000
in 2020. 270,200 refugees spontaneously

Under the October 2020 Solutions
Initiative for Sudan and South Sudan,
UNHCR worked with both Governments,
the Intergovernmental Authority on
Development (IGAD) and other partners to
galvanize a stronger collective response
to humanitarian, development and peacerelated needs in communities affected by
forced displacement. The Governments,
with UNHCR and IGAD support, are
developing durable solutions strategies,
which will complement efforts to revive
both countries’ economies and reduce the
drivers of forced displacement.
In the Middle East, around 36,500 refugees
returned to the Syrian Arab Republic from
Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon and Türkiye, a
similar number to 2020, although a survey
suggested 70% of Syrian refugees wish to
return. While UNHCR does not support
returns to the Syrian Arab Republic, it is
preparing to support returns, when the
conditions are right, guided by the
Comprehensive Protection and Solutions
Strategy and the Global Compact on Refugees
and working with the Government and partners
to address obstacles to voluntary return.

The pace of returns was limited by
persistent problems in many countries
of origin, including fragile peace
processes, continuing insecurity and a
failure to address the original drivers of
displacement. Returns are often impossible
because schools, medical facilities,
roads and other infrastructure have been
destroyed, housing, land and property have
been destroyed or occupied, services are
severely overstretched or unavailable, and
employment opportunities are limited. In
addition, many refugees and IDPs do not
return to their areas of origin but choose
urban locations, especially if they resided
in cities or towns during their displacement,
becoming invisible amongst the urban poor.
While addressing root causes is primarily
the responsibility of countries of origin,
their capacity to do so is intrinsically
linked to meaningful international support.
The Global Compact on Refugees
acknowledged that the international
community has a responsibility in
addressing obstacles to return and
facilitating its sustainability.

in the United Kingdom, and “Sex discrimination in birth registration”, a report on women
not having the right to register a birth in some countries. The campaign’s multimedia
storytelling showcased birth registration campaigns in Nigeria, the Philippines and the
Republic of the Congo. A new visual identity was developed for the final three years of
the campaign.
UNHCR’s diverse network of Goodwill Ambassadors (GWAs), supporters and digital
influencers reached a large global audience – including 200 million people via
social media. UNHCR’s GWA family includes people from all regions and from varied
circumstances, who can share messages and media about UNHCR’s work in an authentic
voice. Many are refugees, including UNHCR’s first footballer GWA, Alphonso Davies.
Highlights included the award-winning film, The Journey, which celebrated the participation
of refugee athletes in the Olympics and Paralympics. GWA content enabled UNHCR to
bring refugee voices to a huge audience through partner channels, including EuroSport,
Buzzfeed Tasty and SportBible. In 2021, UNHCR also launched a digital influencer
engagement programme, bringing in younger voices to support the cause of forcibly
displaced and stateless people.

GLOBAL COMMUNICATIONS
UNHCR communicates through the strategic publication of press releases, news comments
and briefing notes, and through powerful stories and messaging that reflect the diversity of
the people it seeks to protect and support, as well as its own staff and operations around
the world. These communications generate support for forcibly displaced and stateless
people and amplify their voices. It counters xenophobia, disinformation and divisive
rhetoric about people forced to flee, in line with the UN “Strategy and plan of action on
hate speech”. UNHCR engages in campaigns and events that are promoted by a diverse
group of Goodwill Ambassadors and high-profile supporters. Using up-to-the-minute data
and metrics, UNHCR continually fine-tunes its communications while keeping the voices of
forcibly displaced and stateless people at the forefront.
On World Refugee Day (WRD), the theme “Together we heal, learn and shine” put a
spotlight on refugee contributions in three areas: health care (including the pandemic
response), education and sports. It also emphasized inclusion. Nine of the top 15 media
peaks were also driven by UNHCR’s proactive communications pieces – around World
Refugee Day, the Global Trends report, the Afghanistan and Ethiopia emergencies, and
initiatives led by Goodwill Ambassadors Alphonso Davies and Gugu Mbatha-Raw.
In 2021, the #IBelong campaign to end statelessness marked 60 years since the adoption
of the 1961 Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness and welcomed two new
accessions to the statelessness conventions: Iceland and Togo. The campaign highlighted
the risk of a COVID-19 vaccine gap for stateless people and urged governments to include
everyone on their territory in vaccination schemes, regardless of their ability to prove

A Letter to World Leaders
West Darfur, Sudan, April 2022
I was born in Sudan in 2003, and into conflict.
In fact, when I was born, my family had already fled
their home once due to violence, and they had to
flee again shortly after my birth as the war worsened
and grew closer. I still live in a camp for internally
displaced people. I am a simple guy, coming from
a poor family. But being poor is not what makes
me sad. What makes me sad is war and fighting,
because I feel like my country is dying in front of
me and I’m not able to do anything to help. But I try
not to feel like that.

204 UNHCR GLOBAL REPORT 2021

People around me are fighting. I am fighting too, but
in a different way – by going to school. I go to the
local village school. I want to combat ignorance, and
I have goals. I am always there –standing in front of
the students telling them that life can be good and
telling them what love and peace could mean. I want
my nation to move from a place of ignorance to a
place of knowledge. I plan to create youth groups,
where young people can gather to discuss our
differences and figure out ways to get along. When
I finish my secondary schooling, I want to go abroad
to university. When I come back, I will help rebuild
Sudan. We need hospitals and universities and much

more. Sudan has a lot of challenges, but I know we
can solve them. Someday, Sudan can serve as a
model to other nations struggling with violence.

As I am writing this, violence has come again. I can
hear gunfire. Eyman knows people who died in the
recent fighting.

I live with my parents and brothers and sisters and love
spending time with my family. My father and mother
never had the chance to go to school. My father was
a hunter. He tried to talk to people about peace, but
no one listened – he thinks it’s because he was not
an educated man. He passed along his dream of
spreading peace to me. I used to work as a carpenter
to support my family, but now I only have one job: to go
to school. At school, I study the Koran, Arabic, history
and English as well as other subjects. My favourite
book is Treasure Island, by Robert Louis Stevenson.
Once I’ve mastered English I want to learn French!

When UNHCR asked me to write a letter, they
asked what I might like to tell world leaders. That is
really a powerful question! I would like the leaders
of the world to help us, and our country, and
everyone who has been forcibly displaced. We need
more schools and hospitals, for example. But mostly
we need peace.

My greatest wish is to see the people in my nation
sitting together, laughing. I’m sure that one day that
will happen. Many people don’t think I, or people like
me, belong because of our religion. But I want to be
a bridge, and I’ve gathered people together around
me to realize my goals of working with young people
in the community to teach them that everyone
has rights.
One of the people who makes me believe peace
is possible is Eyman, a friend I met who lives in the
local village. She and I learned about the UNHCR
Journalist Mentorship Programme at the same time
and joined together, even though we had just met
and are from different communities. We decided right
away we wanted to learn more ways to bring peace to
our country – to stop racism, jealousy, tribalism and
anything else that works against justice and equality.
We wanted to learn how to tell our story and how to
write and speak well in English to let others hear our
stories as well. Being a bridge is not easy – where we
live, even two people from different communities being
seen together could put them in danger but Eyman
and I decided to do this whatever the cost to us.

I know that the challenges facing the leaders of
the world are not easy. But those who have been
displaced also have ideas and can share them. We
can relate our stories and tell people of the world
what has happened to us and work with them to find
ways to keep anyone else from being forced to leave
their home.
But first, I want to finish my studies. Someday I want
to travel outside the country to a university – the
best university! I want to learn more about life there,
and then I want to come back to my country and
continue to be a bridge between people who now
are only fighting.

MEMBERS OF UNHCR’s EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE
AND STATES PARTIES TO THE REFUGEE AND

UNHCR is governed by the United Nations General Assembly and the Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC). In 1958,
ECOSOC established the Executive Committee of the High Commissioner’s Programme (ExCom), pursuant to a resolution
of the General Assembly. Its main tasks are to approve the High Commissioner’s programmes, advise the High
Commissioner in the exercise of his functions (mainly on protection issues), and oversee the Office’s finances and
administration.
ExCom holds an annual session in Geneva every October. The 72nd session took place from 4 to 8 October 2021. Meetings
of the Executive Committee’s Standing Committee are held at various dates throughout the year to carry on the work
between plenary sessions.
ExCom membership is on the widest possible geographical basis from those States (Members of the United Nations) with
a demonstrated interest in, and devotion to, the solution of refugee problems. By the end of 2021, there were 107 ExCom
members in the following table – in blue – which also shows the States parties to the 1951 Convention relating to the Status
of Refugees and its Protocol of 1967 and to the 1954 Convention relating to the Status of Stateless Persons and the 1961
