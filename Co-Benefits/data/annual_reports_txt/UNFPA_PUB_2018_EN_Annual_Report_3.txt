FOREWORD

Accelerating the 	
promise of Cairo
Women have a right to make their own decisions 	
about whether, when or how often to become pregnant.
That right was reaffirmed in 1994 in Cairo at the
landmark International Conference on Population
and Development (ICPD), where 179 governments
also agreed that sexual and reproductive health is the
foundation for economic and social development.
I remember being in Cairo for that conference. 	
I remember the excitement, the sense of purpose and
of being witness to something truly extraordinary—
countries from all regions of the world committing
to enabling people to make informed choices about
their sexual and reproductive health as a matter of
fundamental human rights and as a foundation for
individual and collective well-being.

Since 1994, governments, activists, civil society
organizations and institutions such as UNFPA have
rallied behind the Programme of Action and pledged
to tear down barriers that have stood between women
and girls and their rights and choices. Despite the
remarkable gains made since 1994, we still have a long
way to go before we can claim to have lived up to the
promises we made in Cairo. Too many women and girls
are not yet enjoying their rights.

The ICPD’s Programme of Action promoted a vision 	
of integrated development that foreshadowed the 	
United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable
Development and emphasized the same principles 	
that underpin today’s Sustainable Development Goals:
non-discrimination and universality; the centrality 	
of health, education and women’s empowerment 	
to sustainable development; and the collective need 	
to ensure environmental sustainability.

This is what the world would look like if it had realized the
vision of Cairo:
The more than 800 women who die every day in
pregnancy or giving birth would survive.
The 214 million women who want to prevent pregnancy
would have access to modern contraception.
The one in three women who are subjected to physical or
sexual violence in their lifetime would live in safety, with
respect and dignity. The 200 million girls and women who
have been subjected to female genital mutilation would
never have been harmed, and the 33,000 girls who are
forced to marry every day would be deciding for themselves
as adults whether or when to enter into a relationship.
In 2018, we at UNFPA set in motion a strategic effort,
based on quality data, to achieve three zeros by 2030:
zero unmet need for contraception; zero preventable
maternal deaths; and zero gender-based violence and
harmful practices, such as child marriage and female
genital mutilation.
Our ambition looks towards 2030 because that is when
the Sustainable Development Goals are to be achieved.
Success towards these goals depends on success in
empowering all women and girls to enjoy their rights and
to have real choices in all aspects of their lives.
We began reorienting our programmes around the
world in 2018, in keeping with the focus on making

TOWARDS

contraception accessible to women and young people,
enabling women to have healthy pregnancies and safe
births, and protecting women and girls from harm.
Because these efforts must be based on quality data, we
also strengthened our capacities for data analysis and
dissemination to help governments formulate policies
that close gaps in services, particularly for those who
have been left behind. This report shows the impact our
programmes have had on the lives of women and girls in
155 countries and territories in 2018.
UNFPA cannot, however, achieve these three zeros on our
own. Governments, civil society, and individuals must all
be part of the movement. They will have an opportunity
to join the next leg of the journey towards rights and
choices for all at the Nairobi Summit on ICPD25 in Kenya
in November of this year. The Governments of Kenya and
Denmark, co-conveners together with UNFPA, will call
on all donors, all countries, all civil society organizations,
all community and youth leaders, all parliamentarians,
all international financial institutions and the private
sector to recommit to the principles and objectives of
the Programme of Action—to make our three zeros
everyone’s three zeros, and to complete the unfinished
business of Cairo.
Universality is a guiding principle of the ICPD Programme
of Action: everyone has a right to sexual and reproductive
health, regardless of where they live, their income level
or their circumstances—even if they are displaced by
conflict or disaster. Last year, UNFPA and its partners

ZERO

-----------------------Page 6 End-----------------------

reached an estimated 18 million people in over 55
countries with humanitarian assistance. This included
the implementation and coordination of the minimum
initial service package for reproductive health to ensure
that women and girls affected by humanitarian crisis
have their needs addressed in line with humanitarian and
human rights principles and priorities.
UNFPA continued to strengthen our capacity to respond
quickly in emergencies. We established a Humanitarian
Response Office and will aim to have it fully staffed in
mid-2019. We also established a new Humanitarian
Action Thematic Fund to streamline donor support for
our life-saving programmes.
UNFPA in 2018 continued to prioritize innovation to
create and scale up data-driven, sustainable, open
solutions to bring about transformative change for
women, adolescents and youth. For example, we
launched a Population Data Platform, which allows
planners to identify and map where needs are greatest
and where interventions need to focus to reach those
furthest behind. By allowing for combining different
sources of data, such as census and surveys, the
Population Data Platform can help highlight, for example,
which districts in a country have the highest rates of
child marriage, or where demand for contraceptives
outstrips supply.
Innovation is also contributing to UNFPA efforts to renew
itself and to strengthen our relationships with United
Nations partner agencies so that we all deliver more

and deliver better for women and girls in developing
countries. In support of reform of the United Nations
development system and to best equip UNFPA to
deliver on its strategic plan, we made strides in our
comprehensive change process. This will ensure that
we have the organizational culture, structure, systems
and skills necessary to achieve our three zeros and help
realize the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
In this year, our 50th, as we look back on 2018, we echo
the words of Dr. Nafis Sadik. Describing the path to
sustainable development, she said:

“People are at the heart of the process, as
agents and as beneficiaries. We have it in
our power to lighten their burdens, remove
obstacles in their path and permit them the
full flowering of their potential as human
beings. That is the moral and ethical basis
of the ICPD.”
People-centred sustainable development remains the
moral and ethical cornerstone of our work to ensure
rights and choices for all. We at UNFPA will do our
utmost to finish the unfinished business of ICPD and
thereby fulfill the promise of sexual and reproductive
health and rights for everyone, everywhere.

Towards 	

ZERO

unmet need 	
for family
planning
The unmet need for family planning has dropped by about
half since 1969, the year UNFPA was established. At the same
time in developing countries, the share of married women
using a modern method of contraception since that time has
nearly tripled, to about 57 per cent.
To achieve zero unmet need for family planning by 2030,
governments will have to accelerate actions to expand 	
access to all.
In 2018, UNFPA continued making the full range of quality
contraceptives and services accessible, enabling millions of
women to make their own decisions about whether, when or
how often to become pregnant. To support countries’ family
planning initiatives, UNFPA procured the equivalent of a
year’s worth of contraception for about 68 million couples in
developing countries.

Towards 	

ZERO

preventable
maternal
deaths
While progress towards reducing the maternal
mortality ratio in developing countries continued
in 2018, it is not at the rate required to achieve the
UNFPA goal of zero preventable maternal deaths by
2030. To reach that goal, developing countries must
accelerate their annual rates of reduction by at least
7.5 per cent.
UNFPA is helping lower the number of preventable
maternal deaths through programmes that reduce
inequities in access to quality sexual, reproductive,
maternal and newborn health care, ensuring universal
health coverage that includes sexual and reproductive
health care, and strengthening health systems.

gender-based
violence
and harmful
practices
About one in three women worldwide will have
experienced physical or sexual violence at some point in
her lifetime. And, every day, tens of thousands of girls
are subjected to the harmful practices of female genital
mutilation and child marriage.
The rate of female genital mutilation has declined over
the past three decades. But to achieve the 2030 target of
ending this harmful practice, the rate of reduction must
accelerate thirteen-fold over the current rate.
The rate of child marriage has also declined, but to meet
the 2030 target, progress must be 12 times faster than
the rate of the past decade.

AFRICA, EAST AND SOUTHERN
Of the 85,000 preventable maternal deaths in East and Southern Africa every year, about one quarter are among
adolescents and more than half take place in humanitarian settings. UNFPA in 2018 helped reduce preventable
maternal deaths in the region through greater access to emergency obstetric care; antenatal, safe-delivery and
postnatal care; and modern contraception. Actions included training midwives in 16 countries to provide highquality, integrated, reproductive, maternal, neonatal, child and adolescent health care. Actions also included
collection and analysis of maternal mortality data to identify—and fill—gaps in services.
UNFPA aimed to reduce the unmet demand for family planning, especially among young people and marginalized
populations, by improving the quality and reliability of services and by offering a range of contraceptive options.
UNFPA programmes in 2018 advanced gender equality and women’s empowerment and addressed the physical
and psychological impact of gender-based violence.

AFRICA, WEST AND CENTRAL
UNFPA scaled up services to help girls in West and Central Africa make a safe and healthy transition from
adolescence to adulthood. Through a Sahel Women’s Empowerment and Demographic Dividend, or SWEDD,
project, UNFPA expanded safe spaces for girls who are not in school and at risk of the harmful practice of child
marriage. A demographic dividend is the additional potential for economic growth that can result from shifts in a
population’s age structure when the share of the working-age population expands relative to the non-working-age
population.
Also as part of the SWEDD project, UNFPA supported a new programme to train midwives and nurses with the
aim of reducing preventable maternal deaths. Three new Centres of Excellence for the Masters in Nursing and
Obstetrics were established in Côte d'Ivoire, Mali and Niger.
UNFPA, through the Ouagadougou Partnership to end unmet need for family planning in nine West African
countries, helped 1.4 million women gain access to modern contraception between 2016 and 2018.

ASIA AND THE PACIFIC
UNFPA in Asia and the Pacific stepped up efforts in 2018 to end unmet need for family planning, preventable
maternal deaths and gender-based violence and harmful practices against women and girls.
UNFPA strengthened programmes to reduce preventable maternal death in countries with higher maternal
mortality ratios, contributing to reaching targets under the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030. These
countries are Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Cambodia, Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan,
Papua New Guinea and Timor-Leste.
To help meet the goal of ending unmet need for family planning, UNFPA advocated for increased investments in
contraceptives and for programmes that enhance reproductive rights in lower-income countries, such as Cambodia
and the Lao People’s Democratic Republic.
Under the multi-year “kNOwVAWdata” initiative, UNFPA supported the collection, analysis and communication of
data about the prevalence of violence against women in the region and created a curriculum to train enumerators
in carrying out surveys that protect women’s privacy. In addition, UNFPA increased support for programmes to end
the harmful practice of child marriage in South Asia.

EASTERN EUROPE 	
AND CENTRAL ASIA
In Eastern Europe and Central Asia, UNFPA helped countries make progress towards reaching zero unmet need for
family planning and zero preventable maternal deaths. But emphasis was placed on ending gender-based violence,
which prevents women and girls from enjoying their rights, including reproductive rights.
In 2018, UNFPA joined an initiative led by the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe to generate,
for the first time in the region, comparable data on violence against women and girls. The survey revealed that
70 per cent of women had been subjected to some form of violence, and one in three had experienced physical
or sexual violence.
UNFPA stepped up efforts to assist the countries of the region in establishing systems that bring together health care,
law enforcement and criminal justice to support survivors, and to strengthen services in humanitarian settings. UNFPA
also worked across the region to help prevent violence through programmes that raised awareness and promoted
behaviour change.
UNFPA also helped engage men and boys in preventing violence, but also more broadly in achieving gender
equality, through programmes such as the “Let’s Talk!” campaign, which challenges taboos around women’s
health, and through gender-sensitive policies that allow both parents to have careers and share household and
care responsibilities.

LATIN AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN
Maternal and neonatal mortality rates have decreased in Latin America and the Caribbean but access to quality
care is still out of reach for many pregnant women. In response, UNFPA supported evidence-based interventions
that improved the quality of maternal health care, especially in the prevention and management of obstetric
complications and emergencies. UNFPA also helped strengthen midwifery training programmes.
UNFPA supported the region’s efforts to end unmet need for family planning by increasing supplies of
contraceptives and bolstering capacities to procure and manage supplies of contraceptives and monitor quality.
UNFPA also supported the introduction of subdermal implants in four countries.
In collaboration with national stakeholders and partner organizations, UNFPA helped improve coordination of
services for survivors of gender-based violence among the health and criminal justice sectors.
