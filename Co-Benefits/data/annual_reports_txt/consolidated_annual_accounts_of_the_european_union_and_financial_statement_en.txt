FOREWORD

                              It is my pleasure to present the 2018 annual accounts of the European
                              Union. They provide a complete overview of the EU finances and the
                              implementation of the EU budget for the last year, including information
                              on contingent liabilities, financial commitments and other obligations of
                              the Union. Reflecting the multiannual nature of the Union’s activities, they
                              offer explanations of the key financial figures and their evolution. The
                              consolidated annual accounts of the European Union are part of the
                              Commission’s integrated financial and accountability reporting
                              package and form an essential part of our highly developed system of
                              financial accountability.

                              Despite its relatively modest size, the EU budget makes a big difference to
                              millions of Europeans. It complements national budgets and supports
                              political priorities where it has real added value and where it can deliver
                              results in the most efficient way.

2018 was the fifth year under the current multiannual financial framework; all the financial programmes
are fully operational. The implementation of the EU budget totalled EUR 173.1 billion in commitment
appropriations, and EUR 156.7 billion in payment appropriations. Throughout the year, the EU budget
continued to provide our response to the challenges deriving from a complex geopolitical environment
while simultaneously guaranteeing strategic investment and sustainable growth in Europe.

Nearly half of the funds were aimed at stimulating growth, employment        and competitiveness. Funding
was provided for reaserach and innovation under Horizon 2020, for small      and medium sized enterprises
under the COSME programme or for education under Erasmus+. The                European Fund for Strategic
Investments, Connecting Europe Facility and the European Structural and      Investment Funds all had also
a major role to play. I invite you to discover the stories behind many EU    investments on the ‘InvestEU’
portal (https://europa.eu/investeu).

The EU budget offered also strong support in other priority areas such as the EU's comprehensive
approach to migration, the security union and the EU's external action. It allowed the Union to play a
strong role beyond our borders during a period of turbulence in Europe’s neighbourhood and contributed
to achieving cross-cutting policy objectives related to the climate change and the biodiversity. In 2018
the amount allocated to climate mainstreaming amounted to more than EUR 32 billion, 20 % of the total
budget.

Finally, the continued support was provided to promoting sustainable growth and the preservation of
Europe's natural resources though the Common Agricultural and Fisheries Policies and activities in the
fields of climate and environment under the LIFE programme.

The consolidated annual accounts of the European Union are produced in accordance with International
Public Sector Accounting Standards. In order to uphold these standards, the Commission is
consistently improving its rules and procedures, organisational structure and agility. Reporting
consistently and effectively increases the accountability of the EU spending, not only for the purpose of
legal compliance. It helps to engage with citizens and with other stakeholders, and to maintain their
confidence and trust in the European Union.

                                       Annual accounts of the European Union 2018



EUROPEAN UNION POLITICAL AND
FINANCIAL FRAMEWORK, GOVERNANCE
AND ACCOUNTABILITY
The European Union (EU) is a Union within which the Member States confer competences to attain
objectives they have in common. The Union is founded on the values of respect for human dignity,
freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights, including the rights of
persons belonging to minorities. These values are common to the Member States in a society in which
pluralism, non-discrimination, tolerance, justice, solidarity and equality between women and men prevail.


1.          POLITICAL AND FINANCIAL FRAMEWORK
                            The overarching objectives and principles that guide the Union and the
                            European Institutions are defined in the Treaties. The Union and the EU
       EU Treaties          institutions may only act within the limits of the competences conferred by
                            the Treaties so as to attain the objectives set out therein and must do this
                            in accordance with the principles1 of subsidiarity and proportionality. To attain
its objectives and carry out its policies, the Union provides itself with the necessary financial means. The
Commission is responsible for implementing the objectives in cooperation with the Member States and in
accordance with the principle of sound financial management.

The EU pursues the objectives established in the Treaty with a number of tools, one of which is the EU
budget. Others are, for example, proposing legislation or pursuing policy strategies.

                                 The political priorities of the Commission are defined in the political guidelines
    Commission political         set by the President of the Commission. These guidelines provide a roadmap
        priorities               for the Commission's action that is fully consistent and compatible with
                                 Europe 2020 as the EU's long-term growth strategy.

    10 PRIORITIES

                  A new boost for jobs, growth and                              A balanced and progressive trade
                  investment.                                                   policy to harness globalisation.



                  A connected digital single market.                            An area of Justice and Fundamental
                                                                                Rights based on mutual trust.



                  A resilient Energy Union           with a                     Towards a new policy on migration.
                  forward-looking  climate           change
                  policy.


                  A deeper and fairer internal market                           Europe as a stronger global actor.
                  with a strengthened industrial base.

     Under the principle of subsidiarity, the Union shall act only if and in so far as the objectives of the proposed action
     cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States but can rather, by reason of the scale or effects, be better
     achieved at Union level. Under the principle of proportionality, the content and form of Union action shall not
     exceed what is necessary to achieve the objectives of the Treaties. See Article 5 of the TFEU.

                A deeper and fairer Economic and                        A Union of democratic change.
                Monetary Union (EMU).




                            The Europe 2020 strategy agreed in 2010 by the Heads of State or
      Europe 2020           Government of EU Member States defined a 10-year jobs and growth strategy
        strategy            for the EU2. The strategy put forward three mutually reinforcing priorities of
                            smart, sustainable and inclusive growth with five EU headline targets.
The EU budget is one of the EU levers contributing to the delivery of the Europe 2020 objectives. A wide
range of actions at national, EU and international levels are being mobilised to deliver concrete results in
relation to the Europe 2020 strategy.

                            Sustainable development has long been at the heart of the European project.
    2030 Agenda for         The EU Treaties give recognition to its economic, social and environmental
      Sustainable           dimensions which should be addressed together. The EU is committed to
     Development3           development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the
                            ability of future generations to meet their own needs. The EU budget plays an
essential role in many sustainability challenges from youth unemployment to ageing populations, climate
change, pollution, sustainable energy and migration. Under the current Commission, sustainable
development is mainstreamed in key cross-cutting projects as well as in sectoral policies and initiatives.

The policies supported by the EU budget are implemented in accordance with the Multiannual Financial
Framework (MFF) and corresponding sectorial legislation defining spending programmes.
                         The Multiannual Financial Framework translates the EU’s political priorities
                         into financial terms over a period long enough to be effective and to provide a
 Multiannual Financial
                         coherent long-term vision for beneficiaries of EU funds and co-financing
    Framework and
                         national authorities. It sets maximum annual amounts (ceilings) for EU
spending programmes
                         expenditure as a whole and for the main categories of expenditure
                         (headings). The sum of the ceilings of all headings gives the total ceiling of
commitment appropriations. The Multiannual Financial Framework is adopted by unanimity indicating the
agreement of all Member States to the objectives and the level of spending (maximum level of budget
commitments and payments), with the consent of the European Parliament.

                        The    Multiannual    Financial Framework    is   complemented      by    the
    Interinstitutional  interinstitutional agreement4 which is a political agreement between the
       agreement        European Parliament, the Council and the Commission. The purpose of this
                        agreement, adopted in 2013 in accordance with Article 295 of the TFEU, is to
implement budgetary discipline, improve the functioning of the annual budgetary procedure and
cooperation between the institutions on budgetary matters as well as to ensure sound financial
management.

                             The annual budget is prepared by the Commission and usually agreed by mid-
                             December by the European Parliament and the Council, based on the
     Annual budget           procedure of Art. 314 TFEU. According to the principle of budget equilibrium,
                             total revenue must equal total expenditure (payment appropriations) for a
                             given financial year.

The main sources of funding of the EU are own resources revenues which are complemented by other
revenues. There are three types of own resources: traditional own resources (such as custom duties and
sugar levies), the own resource based on value added tax (VAT) and the own resource based on gross
national income (GNI). Other revenues arising from the activities of the EU (e.g. competition fines)
normally represent less than 10 % of total revenue. The overall amount of own resources needed to
finance the budget is determined by total expenditure less other revenue. In the current MFF the total
amount of own resources cannot exceed 1.20 % of the sum of gross national income (GNI) of the
Member States.

                                     Annual accounts of the European Union 2018

The EU's operational expenditure covers the various headings of the Multiannual Financial Framework and
takes different forms, depending on how the money is paid out and managed. The EU budget is
implemented in three management modes:

          Shared management: under this method of budget implementation, tasks are delegated to
          Member States. About 75 % of the expenditure falls under this management mode covering such
          areas as agricultural spending and structural actions.

          Direct management: this is where the budget is implemented directly by the Commission
          services.

          Indirect management: this refers to cases where the Commission confers tasks of implementation
          of the budget to third parties, such as the EU regulatory agencies or international organisations.

                               The Financial Regulation (FR)5 applicable to the general budget is a central
                               act in the regulatory architecture of the EU´s finances defining EU financial
    Financial Regulation
                               rules applicable to the EU budget.




2.          GOVERNANCE AND ACCOUNTABILITY

2.1.        INSTITUTIONAL STRUCTURE

The organisational governance of the EU consists of institutions, agencies and other EU bodies, which are
listed in note 9 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements. The European Investment Bank
(EIB), the European Investment Fund (EIF) and the European Central Bank (ECB) are not included in the
scope of the Financial Regulation. The main institutions, in the sense of being responsible for drafting
policies and taking decisions, are the European Parliament, the European Council, the Council and the
Commission.

The European Commission is a unique organisation. Under the Treaty, the Commission is responsible for
planning, preparing and proposing legislation; for managing EU policies, including the monitoring of
implementation of EU legislation and ensuring its enforcement and allocating EU funding; and for
representing the EU internationally.

As foreseen in the Treaty6, the Commission implements the budget in cooperation with the Member
States. Together, they ensure that the appropriations are used in accordance with the principles of sound
financial management. Regulations lay down the control and audit obligations of the Member States in
the implementation of the budget and the resulting responsibilities. They also lay down the
responsibilities and detailed rules for each institution concerning its part in effecting its own expenditure.

The Commission performs these roles under the leadership of the College of Commissioners, which sets
priorities and takes overall political responsibility for the decisions of the Commission. The President,
whose role was strengthened by the Nice and Lisbon Treaties, decides on the internal organisation of the
Commission, ensuring that it acts consistently, efficiently and as a collegiate body.

The Commission's internal functioning is based on a number of key principles underpinning good
governance: clear roles and responsibilities, a strong commitment to performance management and
compliance with the legal framework, clear accountability mechanisms, a high quality and inclusive
regulatory framework, openness and transparency, and high standards of ethical behaviour.

2.2.        THE COMMISSION'S GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE

The European Commission has a unique governance system, with a clear distinction between political and
administrative oversight structures and well-defined lines of responsibility and financial accountability7.
The system is based on the Treaties and the structure has evolved to adapt to a changing environment
and to remain in line with best practice as set out in relevant international standards8.

In 2018, the Commission adopted a ‘governance package’9, which significantly streamlined and
strengthened its corporate governance arrangements and leveraged recent audit work by the European
Court of Auditors10 and the Internal Audit Service.

     •    The College of Commissioners assumes collegial political responsibility for the work of the
          Commission. Operational implementation of the budget is delegated to Directors-General and
          Heads of Service who lead the administrative structure of the Commission11.

     •    The College delegates financial management tasks to the Directors-General or Heads of Service
          who thereby become Authorising Officers by Delegation (AOD). These tasks can further be
          delegated to Directors, Heads of Unit and others, who thereby become Authorising Officers by
          Sub-Delegation. The responsibility of the Authorising Officers covers the entire management
          process, from determining what needs to be done to achieve the policy objectives set by the
          institution to managing the activities from both an operational and budgetary standpoint.

     •    The Audit Progress Committee follows-up implementation of audits, in particular of the Internal
          Audit Service but also on the basis of European Court of Auditors audits.

     •    Under the authority of the President, the Corporate Management Board, chaired by the
          Secretary-General, brings together on a regular basis the Directors-General responsible for
          budget, human resources and security, and the Director-General of the Legal Service. The
          Member(s) responsible for budget and administration in the Cabinet of the President, as well as
          the Head(s) of Cabinet of the Member(s) of the Commission in charge of budget, human
          resources and administration, are observers. The board provides coordination, oversight, advice
          and strategic orientations on corporate management issues, in areas including the management
          of financial and human resources, risk management, performance management, IT governance,
          cyber- and physical security, business continuity, and information management. In this way, the
          Corporate Management Board contributes to ensuring that the necessary structures, processes
          and administrative policies are in place in the Commission to deliver on the political priorities of
          the College and the tasks entrusted to it by the Treaties in an efficient and effective manner.


2.3.        THE COMMISSION’S FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT

In the Commission, the roles and responsibilities in financial management are clearly defined (e.g. in the
Financial Regulation) and applied. This is a decentralised approach with clear responsibilities with the aim
of creating an administrative culture that encourages civil servants to take responsibility for activities
over which they have control and to give them control over the activities for which they are responsible.

The Commission may also delegate the implementation of specific programmes to executive agencies.
Expenditure decisions can also be managed via, or together with, another institution or body. A large
proportion of the budget is managed under a system of shared management with the Member States,
notably in the areas of structural funds and agriculture.

     As a result, the term 'European Commission' is used to denote both the institution – the College - formed by the
     Members of the Commission, and its administration managed by the Directors-General of its departments (and
     heads of other administrative structures such as services, offices and executive agencies).

                                 Annual accounts of the European Union 2018

Budget implementation tasks are also entrusted to:
   •       national agencies;
   •       the European Investment Bank Group;
   •       third countries;
   •       international organisations (e.g. the World Bank or the United Nations);
   •       other entities.

As authorising officers by delegation, the Directors-General are responsible for the sound financial
management of resources. In implementing the EU budget, authorising officers by delegation must
comply with the provisions of the Financial Regulation and establish an appropriate internal control
framework. Among other things, the internal control objectives focus on:
   •   effectiveness, efficiency and economy of operations;
   •   financial control and anti-fraud;
   •   integrity and ethics;
   •   the management of human resources;
   •   reliable reporting;
   •   communication;
   •   the safeguarding of assets and information.

Each authorising officer by delegation may rely on one or two senior or middle managers in charge of risk
management and internal control to oversee and monitor the implementation of internal control systems.
The Commission’s central services provide guidance and advice and promote best practices.

Within the context of the Commission's Strategic Planning and Programming cycle, each authorising
officer is required to prepare an annual activity report (“AAR”) on the activities and policy achievements
and results of the year. In the AAR he/she declares that resources have been used based on the
principles of sound financial management and that he/she has set in place control procedures which
provide the necessary guarantee concerning the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions. At
Commission level the Annual Management and Performance Report for the EU budget is the main
instrument through which the College of Commissioners takes political responsibility for the
management of the budget.

The Accounting Officer of the Commission is centrally responsible for the treasury management, recovery
procedures, laying down accounting rules based on International Public Sector Accounting Standards and
methods, validating accounting systems and the preparation of the Commission's and consolidated
annual accounts of the EU. Furthermore, the Accounting Officer is required to sign the annual accounts
declaring that they present fairly, in all material aspects, the financial position, the results of the
operations and the cash flows of the Union. The annual accounts are adopted by the College of
Commissioners. The Accounting Officer is an independent function and bears a major responsibility as
regards financial reporting in the Commission. The Internal Auditor of the Commission is likewise a
centralised and independent function and provides independent advice, opinions and recommendations
on the quality and functioning of internal control systems inside the Commission, EU agencies and other
autonomous bodies.


2.4.     PERFORMANCE FRAMEWORK

Implementing robust performance frameworks is essential for ensuring a strong focus on results, EU
added value and sound management of EU programmes. The performance framework of the EU budget is
highly specified, scoring higher than any Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development
(OECD) country in the standard index of performance budgeting frameworks. The EU budget performance
framework reports on several types and levels of strategic goals, objectives and targets, including the
Europe 2020 strategy and other political priorities. It must also take account of the complementarity and
mainstreaming of policies and programmes and the key role of the Member States in implementing the
EU Budget.

   •   Objectives, indicators and targets are strongly featured in the programmes' legal basis and every
       year the Commission reports on them through the Programme Statements that accompany the
       draft budget. They provide all of the key information that is necessary for careful programme
       scrutiny and performance measurement: this includes 7-year financial commitments; programme

                                 Annual accounts of the European Union 2018

        performance baselines (starting points for policy action); end-goals (to be achieved at the end of
        the multi-annual programming period); and intermediate milestones.

    •   To ensure resources are allocated to priorities and that every action brings high performance and
        added value, the Commission promotes a performance culture across the Commission services.
        Moreover, over the past years it has developed an approach that promotes a better balance
        between compliance and performance.

    •   The Annual Management and Performance Report for the EU budget provides a
        comprehensive overview on the performance, management and protection of the EU budget. It
        explains how the EU budget supports the European Union’s political priorities, the results
        achieved with the EU budget, and the role the Commission plays in ensuring and promoting the
        highest standards of budgetary and financial management.

    •   The European Court of Auditors takes a systematic and thorough approach to assessing the
        qualitative aspects of budgeting, including the performance dimension, as a normal part of its
        annual reporting and through special reports.

All of these elements place the budget authority in a strong position to take performance into account as
a significant factor in deciding on the next annual budget.


2.5.      FINANCIAL REPORTING

The main element of EU financial reporting is the Integrated Financial and Accountability Reporting
of the EU, which comprises the consolidated annual accounts of the EU, the Annual Management and
Performance Report for the budget, which includes the evaluation report according to art. 247(1) (e) FR,
the annual internal audit report, a long-term forecast of future inflows and outflows covering the next five
years and the report on the follow-up to the discharge. The Integrated Financial and Accountability
Reporting provides the public with a comprehensive view of the financial and operational situation of the
EU each year.

The consolidated annual accounts of the EU provide financial information on the activities of the
institutions, agencies and other bodies of the EU from both an accrual accounting and budgetary
perspective. These accounts do not encompass the annual accounts of Member States.

The consolidated annual accounts of the EU consist of two separate but linked parts:

        a)     the consolidated financial statements; and

        b)      the reports on implementation of the budget, which provide an aggregated record of
                budget implementation.

In addition, the consolidated annual accounts of the EU are accompanied by a Financial Statement
Discussion and Analysis (FSDA), which summarises significant changes and trends in the financial
statements and explains significant risks and uncertainties the EU has faced and needs to address in
future.

2.6.        EXTERNAL AUDIT AND DISCHARGE PROCEDURE

External audit
The European Court of Auditors (ECA) is the external auditor of the EU institutions (and bodies). The
ECA's mission is to contribute to improving EU financial management, promote accountability and
transparency, and act as the independent guardian of the financial interests of the citizens of the EU. Its
role as the EU’s independent external auditor is to check that EU funds are correctly accounted for, are
collected and spent in accordance with the relevant rules and regulations and have achieved value for
money.

As part of its activities, the ECA draws up for the use of the European Parliament and the Council:

(1)     an annual report on the activities financed from the general budget, detailing its observations on
        the EU annual accounts and underlying transactions;
(2)     an opinion, based on its audits and included in the annual report in the form of a statement of
        assurance, on (i) the reliability of the accounts and (ii) the legality and regularity of the
        underlying transactions involving both revenue collected and payments to final beneficiaries; and
(3)     special reports covering specific areas as well as specific annual reports (on e.g. the European
        Development Fund, on EU Agencies).

Discharge

The final step of the budget lifecycle is the discharge procedure for a given financial year. It represents
the political dimension of the external control of budget implementation and is the decision by which the
"Discharge Authority" (i.e. the European Parliament, acting on a Council recommendation) "releases" the
Commission (and other EU bodies) from its responsibility for the management of a given budget. This
decision is based on an examination of the EU consolidated annual accounts and a set of Commission
reports (the Annual Management and Performance Report for the EU budget, the report on the follow-up
to the previous year's discharge and the annual report to the discharge authority on internal audits
carried out) as well as on the European Court of Auditors' Annual Report, audit opinion (the "Statement
of Assurance") and Special Reports. It also takes account of the Commission written replies to questions
and other information requests as well as hearings of the Budget Commissioner, Commissioners and
Directors General responsible for the main spending areas and the Secretary General before the
European Parliament's Budgetary Control Committee (CONT).

                                Annual accounts of the European Union 2018

The outcome of the discharge procedure may be threefold: granting, postponement or refusal of the
discharge. The final discharge reports also include specific requests addressed to the Commission by both
the European Parliament and the Council. These requests are subject to a follow up report in which the
Commission outlines the concrete actions it has already taken or intends to take.

HIGHLIGHTS OF THE FINANCIAL YEAR
2018
Implementation of the 2018 Union budget
The 2018 adopted budget focused on two main policy priorities for Europe among the ten priorities set by
President Juncker at the beginning of this Commission’s mandate. One was a European response to the
new challenges deriving from the complex geopolitical environment, from migration management to the
protection of the EU's external borders and the security of its citizens. The other was strategic investment
and sustainable growth, to support economic cohesion, and create jobs, in particular for young people. In
addition to these two clear priorities, in 2018, the EU budget and other instruments continued to support
farmers and rural development, and deepened and strengthened the strategic interconnectors and
networks between EU countries with the implementation of the digital single market and the energy
union. The Commission continued to support the external projection of the EU as a key economic and
political partner as well as a leading international provider of investment and humanitarian assistance.

The implementation of the EU budget in 2018 totalled EUR 173.1 billion in commitment appropriations,
and EUR 156.7 billion in payment appropriations.

Nearly half of the funds – EUR 87.4 billion in commitment appropriations were aimed at stimulating smart
and inclusive growth, jobs, competitiveness and cohesion. This included funding for research and
innovation under Horizon 2020, education under Erasmus+, small and medium sized enterprises under
the COSME programme, the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF), the guarantee fund for the European Fund
for Strategic Investments (EFSI) which is the tool behind the Investment Plan for Europe, and fostering
convergence among Member States and among regions through the European Structural and Investment
Funds (ESIF). Moreover, the EU budget support to European farmers amounted to EUR 44.4 billion in
payments made.

The budget was also used to reinforce the external borders of the Union and address the migration
and refugee crisis by funding actions including emergency assistance, relocation, border control,
resettlement, return and integration of refugees and asylum-seekers. Finally, the budget continued to
fund programmes to support the protection of justice and fundamental rights as well as social cohesion
so that our European societies remain inclusive, free and fair.


The United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union
Background

On 23 June 2016 a majority of the citizens of the United Kingdom who voted in the referendum on
membership of the European Union voted to leave the EU. On 29 March 2017, the United Kingdom
formally notified the European Council of its intention to leave the EU and the European Atomic Energy
Community (Euratom). In doing so, it triggered Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union, which sets
out the procedure for a Member State to withdraw from the Union.

The negotiation process

On 19 March 2018 the Commission published a draft of the Withdrawal Agreement that outlined the
progress made in the negotiations. In the financial settlement part of the draft Withdrawal Agreement,
the EU and the UK translated the progress achieved in the first phase of negotiations into a legal text.

A Joint Report was published on 14 November 2018 reporting agreement at negotiators’ level on the full
text of the draft Withdrawal Agreement, and on an outline of the Political Declaration on the framework
for the future relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union. On the same day, this
updated and agreed draft Withdrawal Agreement was published, in which the UK agreed to pay all its
obligations under the current Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) and previous financial perspectives
as if it were still a Member State, including its share of the Union's liabilities and contingent liabilities. The
UK government approved the draft Withdrawal Agreement on the 14 November and the European Council
endorsed it on 25 November 2018. On 11 January 2019, the Council (Article 50) approved the decision
on the conclusion of the Withdrawal Agreement and sent it to the European Parliament for its consent. On
the request of the United Kingdom, in accordance with the procedure set in the Article 50 of the TFEU, on


                                                       14
-----------------------Page 16 End-----------------------

                                Annual accounts of the European Union 2018

21 March 2019 the European Council agreed to extend the UK’s departure date to 22 May 2019, provided
the Withdrawal Agreement was approved by the House of Commons by 29 March 2019 at the latest and
to the 12 April 2019 if it was not the case (European Council Decision (EU) 2019/476 of 22 March 2019,
OJ L80 22.3.2019, p. 1). Subsequent to this, the House of Commons did not approve the Withdrawal
Agreement by 29 March 2019 and so, again on the request of the United Kingdom, on 10 April 2019 the
European Council agreed to an extension to the UK’s departure until 31 October 2019 (European Council
Decision (EU) 2019/584 of 11 April 2019, OJ L101 11.4.2019, p. 1). The withdrawal should take place on
the first day of the month following the completion of the ratification procedures or on 1 November 2019,
whichever is the earliest. The United Kingdom will remain a Member State until the new withdrawal date,
with full rights and obligations in accordance with Article 50 TEU, and the United Kingdom has a right to
revoke its notification at any time.

Financial settlement and the 2018 EU annual accounts

With regard to the financial settlement, it was stated in the draft Withdrawal Agreement published on 14
November 2018, that the UK would pay all its obligations under the current MFF and previous financial
perspectives as if it were still a Member State. More specifically, the draft Withdrawal Agreement states
that the United Kingdom shall in particular be liable to the Union for its share of:

•      The budgetary commitments of the Union budget and of the budgets of the Union decentralised
       agencies outstanding on 31 December 2020 – see Article 140 of the draft Withdrawal Agreement;

•      The financing of the Union's liabilities incurred until 31 December 2020, with certain exceptions –
       see Article 142;

•      The contingent financial liabilities of the Union arising from financial operations decided/approved
       before the withdrawal date – see Articles 143 & 144; and

•      The payments required to discharge the contingent liabilities of the Union that become due
       related to legal cases concerning financial interests of the Union (provided that the facts forming
       the subject matter of those cases occurred no later than 31 December 2020) – see Article 147.

At the time of the signature of these accounts, and in the absence of ratification by the United Kingdom,
the actual departure date and manner of departure (with or without agreement) is not yet known. Based
on this current situation, there is no financial impact to be reported in the 2018 consolidated EU annual
accounts.

1.         SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES


1.1.       LEGAL BASIS AND ACCOUNTING RULES

The accounts of the EU are kept in accordance with Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 1046/2018 of the
European Parliament and of the Council of 18 July 2018 on the financial rules applicable to the general
budget of the Union, amending Regulations (EU) No 1296/2013, (EU) No 1301/2013, (EU) No
1303/2013, (EU) No 1304/2013, (EU) No 1309/2013, (EU) No 1316/2013, (EU) No 223/2014, (EU) No
283/2014, and Decision No 541/2014/EU and repealing Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012 (OJ L
193, 30 July 2018, p. 1) hereinafter referred to as the 'Financial Regulation' (FR).

In accordance with article 80 of the Financial Regulation, the EU prepares its financial statements on the
basis of accrual-based accounting rules that are based on International Public Sector Accounting
Standards (IPSAS). These accounting rules, adopted by the Accounting Officer of the Commission, have
to be applied by all the institutions and EU bodies falling within the scope of consolidation in order to
establish a uniform set of rules for accounting, valuation and presentation of the accounts with a view to
harmonising the process for drawing up the financial statements and consolidation.

Application of new and amended European Union accounting rules (EAR)

Revised EAR which is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018

The following accounting rules, adopted by the Accounting Officer of the Commission, became
mandatorily effective in the current year:

     •   Revision of EAR 12 "Employee Benefits": The revised EAR 12 was adopted by the Accounting
         Officer in 2017 which is based on the new IPSAS 39 “Employee Benefits” published in July 2016.
         For the first application of the revised EAR 12 there were no significant impacts on the EU
         consolidated financial statements, aside from the recognition of any gain or loss resulting from
         changes in the actuarial assumptions, which under the revised EAR is recognised directly in net
         assets, in contrast with the previous requirement to recognise in surplus or deficit.

New EAR adopted but not yet effective at 31 December 2018

The EU has not applied the following new EAR, which have been adopted by the Accounting Officer of the
Commission, but which is not yet effective:

     •   New EAR 20 "Public Sector Combinations" (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1
         January 2019): The EAR 20, which is based on the IPSAS 40 "Public Sector Combinations",
         establishes the classification of a public sector combination into two different types depending on
         whether the transaction takes place under common control or not: (i) amalgamation, in which the
         transaction is based on the carrying amounts of the entity combined with the EU; and (ii)
         acquisition, in which the transaction is based on the acquisition date fair values of the entity
         acquired by the EU. Both have distinct requirements and levels of disclosure, in order to provide a
         better understanding of its effects to users of the financial statements of the EU.

   The impact on the EU financial statements in the year of initial application will depend on whether in
   that period the EU would enter into a public sector combination transaction.


1.2.       ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES

The objective of financial statements is to provide information about the financial position, performance
and cashflows of an entity that is useful to a wide range of users. For the EU as a public sector entity, the
objectives are more specifically to provide information useful for decision-making, and to demonstrate
the accountability of the entity for the resources entrusted to it. It is with these goals in mind that the
present document has been drawn up.

The overall considerations (or accounting principles) to be followed when preparing the financial
statements are laid down in EU accounting rule 1 "Financial Statements" and are the same as those

                                                     23
-----------------------Page 25 End-----------------------

                                  Annual accounts of the European Union 2018

described in IPSAS 1: fair presentation, accrual basis, going concern, consistency of presentation,
materiality, aggregation, offsetting and comparative information. The qualitative characteristics of
financial reporting are relevance, faithful representation (reliability), understandability, timeliness,
comparability and verifiability.


1.3.      CONSOLIDATION

Scope of consolidation

The consolidated financial statements of the EU comprise all significant controlled entities (i.e. the EU
institutions (including the Commission) and the EU agencies), associates and joint ventures. The
complete list of consolidated entities can be found in note 9 of the EU financial statements. It now
comprises 52 controlled entities and 1 associate. Entities that fall under the consolidation scope, but
which are immaterial to the EU consolidated financial statements as a whole, need not be consolidated or
accounted for using equity method where to do so would result in excessive time or cost to the EU. Those
entities are referred to as 'Minor entities' and are separately listed in note 9. In 2018, 7 entities have
been classified as minor entities.

Controlled entities

The decision to include an entity in the scope of consolidation is based on the control concept. Controlled
entities are all entities for which the EU is exposed, or has right, to variable benefits from its involvement
and has the ability to affect the nature and amount of those benefits through its power over the other
entity. This power must be presently exercisable and must relate to the relevant activities of the entity.
Controlled entities are fully consolidated. The consolidation begins at the first date on which control
exists, and ends when such control no longer exists.

The most common indicators of control within the EU are: creation of the entity through founding treaties
or secondary legislation, financing of the entity from the EU budget, the existence of voting rights in the
governing bodies, audit by the European Court of Auditors and discharge by the European Parliament. An
individual assessment for each entity is made in order to decide whether one or all of the criteria listed
above are sufficient to result in control.

Under this approach, the EU's institutions (except the European Central Bank) and agencies (excluding
the agencies of the former 2nd pillar) are considered as under the exclusive control of the EU and are
therefore included in the consolidation scope. Furthermore, the European Coal and Steel Community
(ECSC) in Liquidation is also considered as a controlled entity.

All material "inter-entity transactions and balances" between EU controlled entities are eliminated, while
unrealised gains and losses on such transactions are not material and so have not been eliminated.

Joint Arrangements

A joint arrangement is an agreement over which the EU and one or more parties have joint control. Joint
control is contractually agreed sharing of control over an arrangement, which exists only when decisions
about the relevant activities require the unanimous consent of parties sharing control. Joint agreements
can be either joint operations or joint ventures. In case a joint arrangement is structured through a
separate vehicle and parties to the joint arrangement have rights to the net assets of the arrangement,
this joint arrangement classifies as a joint venture. Participations in joint ventures are accounted for
using the equity method (see note 1.5.4). In case the parties have rights to the assets, and obligations
for the liabilities, related to the arrangement, this joint arrangement is classified as a joint operation. In
relation to its interest in joint operations, the EU recognises in its financial statements: its assets and
liabilities, revenue and expense, as well as its share of assets, liabilities, revenue and expense held or
incurred jointly.

Associates

Associates are entities over which the EU has, directly or indirectly, significant influence but not control.
It is presumed that significant influence exists if the EU holds directly or indirectly 20 % or more of the
voting rights. Participations in associates are accounted for using the equity method (see note 1.5.4).

                                 Annual accounts of the European Union 2018

Non-consolidated entities the funds of which are managed by the Commission

The funds of the Joint Sickness Insurance Scheme for staff of the EU, the European Development Fund
and the Participants Guarantee Fund are managed by the Commission on their behalf. However, since
these entities are not controlled by the EU, they are not consolidated in its financial statements.


1.4.       BASIS OF PREPARATION

Financial statements are presented annually. The accounting year begins on 1 January and ends on
31 December.


1.4.1.     Currency and basis for conversion

Functional and reporting currency

The financial statements are presented in millions of euros, unless stated otherwise, the euro being the
EU's functional and reporting currency.

Transactions and balances

Foreign currency transactions are translated into euros using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates
of the transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of foreign currency
transactions and from the re-translation at year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities
denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the statement of financial performance. Translation
differences on non-monetary financial instruments classified as available for sale financial assets are
included in the fair value reserve.

Different conversion methods apply to property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, which retain
their value in euros at the rate that applied at the date when they were purchased.

Year-end balances of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are converted into
euros on the basis of the European Central Bank (ECB) exchange rates applying on 31 December:

1.4.2.     Use of estimates

In accordance with IPSAS and generally accepted accounting principles, the financial statements
necessarily include amounts based on estimates and assumptions by management based on the most
reliable information available. Significant estimates include, but are not limited to: amounts for employee
benefit liabilities, provisions, financial risk on inventories and accounts receivable, accrued revenue and
charges, contingent assets and liabilities, degree of impairment of intangible assets and property, plant
and equipment and amounts disclosed in the notes concerning financial instruments. Actual results could
differ from those estimates. Changes in estimates are reflected in the period in which they become
known.

1.5.      BALANCE SHEET

1.5.1.    Intangible assets

Acquired computer software licences are stated at historical cost less accumulated amortisation and
impairment losses. The assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives
(3-11 years). The estimated useful lives of intangible assets depend on their specific economic lifetime or
legal lifetime determined by an agreement. Internally developed intangible assets are capitalised when
the relevant criteria of the EU accounting rules are met and the expenses relate solely to the
development phase of the asset. The costs capitalisable include all directly attributable costs necessary to
create, produce, and prepare the asset to be capable of operating in the manner intended by
management. Costs associated with research activities, non-capitalisable development costs and
maintenance costs are recognised as expenses as incurred.


1.5.2.    Property, plant and equipment

All property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and
impairment losses. Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition, construction
or transfer of the asset.

Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as
appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits or service potential associated with
the item will flow to the EU and its cost can be measured reliably. Repairs and maintenance costs are
charged to the statement of financial performance during the financial period in which they are incurred.

Land and works of art are not depreciated as they are deemed to have an indefinite useful life. Assets
under construction are not depreciated, as these assets are not yet available for use. Depreciation on
other assets is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate their cost less their residual values
over their estimated useful lives, as follows:

Type of asset                                                           Straight line depreciation rate
Buildings                                                                     4 % to 10 %
Space assets                                                                  8 % to 25 %
Plant and equipment                                                           10 % to 25 %
Furniture and vehicles                                                         0 % to 25 %
Computer hardware                                                             25 % to 33 %
Other                                                                         10 % to 33 %

Gains or losses on disposals are determined by comparing proceeds less selling expenses with the
carrying amount of the disposed asset and are included in the statement of financial performance.

Leases

Leases of tangible assets, where the EU has substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership, are
classified as finance leases. Finance leases are capitalised at the lease’s commencement at the lower of
the fair value of the leased asset and the present value of the minimum lease payments. The interest
element of the finance lease payment is charged to expenditure over the period of the lease at a constant
periodic rate in relation to the balance outstanding. The rental obligations, net of finance charges, are
included in financial liabilities (non-current and current). The interest element of the finance cost is
charged to the statement of financial performance over the lease period so as to produce a constant
periodic interest rate on the remaining balance of the liability for each period. The assets held under
finance leases are depreciated over the shorter of the asset's useful life and the lease term.

Leases where the lessor retains a significant portion of the risks and rewards inherent to ownership are
classified as operating leases. Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense in the statement
of financial performance on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

                                  Annual accounts of the European Union 2018

1.5.3.    Impairment of non-financial assets

Assets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortisation/depreciation and are tested
annually for impairment. Assets that are subject to amortisation/depreciation are reviewed for
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be
recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount
exceeds its recoverable (service) amount. The recoverable (service) amount is the higher of an asset’s
fair value less costs to sell and its value in use.

Intangible assets and property, plant and equipment residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and
adjusted if appropriate, at least once per year. An asset’s carrying amount is written down immediately
to its recoverable (service) amount if the asset’s carrying amount is greater than its estimated
recoverable (service) amount. If the reasons for impairments recognised in previous years no longer
apply, the impairment losses are reversed accordingly.


1.5.4.    Investments accounted for using the equity method

Participations in associates and joint ventures

Investments accounted for using the equity method are initially recognised at cost, being the carrying
amount subsequently increased or decreased to recognise the EU’s share of the surplus or deficit of the
investee after the date of acquisition. The EU's share of the investee’s surplus or deficit is recognised in
the statement of financial performance, and its share of investee’s movements in equity is recognised in
the reserves within net assets. The initial cost together with all movements (further contributions, share
of economic results and reserve movements, impairments and dividends) give the book value of the
investment in the financial statements at the balance sheet date. Distributions received from the
investment reduce the carrying amount of the asset.

If the EU's share of deficits of an investment accounted for using the equity method equals or exceeds its
interest in the investment, the EU discontinues recognising its share of further losses ("unrecognised
losses"). After the EU's interest is reduced to zero, additional losses are provided for and a liability is
recognised only to the extent that the EU has incurred legal or constructive obligation or made payments
on behalf of the entity.

If there are indications of impairment, a write-down to the lower recoverable amount is necessary. The
recoverable amount is determined as described under note 1.5.3. If the reason for impairment ceases to
apply at a later date, the impairment loss is reversed to the carrying amount that would have been
determined had no impairment loss been recognised.

In cases where the EU holds 20 % or more of an investment capital fund, it does not seek to exert
significant influence. Such funds are therefore treated as financial instruments and categorised as
available for sale financial assets.

Associates and joint ventures classified as minor entities are not accounted for under the equity method.
EU contributions to those entities are accounted for as an expense of the period.


1.5.5.    Financial assets

Classification

The EU classifies their financial assets in the following categories: financial assets at fair value through
surplus or deficit; loans and receivables; held-to-maturity investments; and available for sale financial
assets. The classification of financial instruments is determined at initial recognition and re-evaluated at
each balance sheet date.

    (i) Financial assets at fair value through surplus or deficit

A financial asset is classified in this category if acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the short
term or if so designated by the entity. Derivatives are also categorised in this category. Assets in this
category are classified as current assets if they are expected to be realised within 12 months of the
balance sheet date.


                                                      27
-----------------------Page 29 End-----------------------

                                   Annual accounts of the European Union 2018

    (ii) Loans and receivables

Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are
not quoted in an active market. They arise when the EU provides money, goods or services directly to a
debtor with no intention of trading the receivable, or in case the EU is subrogated to the rights of the
original lender following a payment made by the EU under a guarantee contract. Payments due within 12
months of the balance sheet date are classified as current assets. Payments due after 12 months from
the balance sheet date are classified as non-current assets. Loans and receivables include term deposits
with the original maturity above three months.

    (iii) Held-to-maturity investments

Held-to-maturity investments are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments
and fixed maturities that the EU has the positive intention and ability to hold to maturity. During this
financial year, the EU did not hold any investments in this category.

    (iv) Available for sale financial assets

Available for sale financial assets are non-derivatives that are either designated in this category or not
classified in any of the other categories. They are classified as either current or non-current assets,
depending on the period of time the EU expects to hold them. Investments in entities that are neither
consolidated nor accounted for using the equity method and other equity-type investments (e.g. Risk
Capital Operations) are also classified as available for sale financial assets.

Initial recognition and measurement

Purchases and sales of financial assets at fair value through surplus or deficit, held-to-maturity and
available for sale are recognised on trade-date – the date on which the EU commits to purchase or sell
the asset. Cash equivalents and loans are recognised when cash is deposited in a financial institution or
advanced to borrowers. Financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value. For all financial assets
not carried at fair value through surplus or deficit transactions costs are added to the fair value at initial
recognition. Financial assets carried at fair value through surplus or deficit are initially recognised at fair
value and transaction costs are expensed in the statement of financial performance.

The fair value of a financial asset on initial recognition is normally the transaction price (i.e. the fair value
of the consideration received), unless the fair value of that instrument is evidenced by comparison with
other observable current market transactions in the same instrument or based on a valuation technique
whose variables include only data from observable markets (e.g. in case of some derivative contracts).
However, when a long-term loan that carries no interest or an interest below market conditions is
granted, its fair value can be estimated as the present value of all future cash receipts discounted using
the prevailing market rate of interest for a similar instrument with a similar credit rating.

Loans granted are measured at their nominal amount, which is considered to be the fair value of the
loan. The reasoning for this is as follows:

    •   The “market environment” for EU lending is very specific and different from the capital market
        used to issue commercial or government bonds. As lenders in these markets have the
        opportunity to choose alternative investments, the opportunity possibility is factored into market
        prices. However, this opportunity for alternative investments does not exist for the EU, which is
        not allowed to invest money on the capital markets; it only borrows funds for the purpose of
        lending at the same rate. This means that there is no alternative lending or investment option
        available to the EU for the sums borrowed. Thus, there is no opportunity cost and therefore no
        basis of comparison with market rates. In fact, the EU lending operation itself represents the
        market. Essentially, since the opportunity cost "option" is not applicable, the market price does
        not fairly reflect the substance of the EU lending transactions. Therefore, it is not appropriate to
        determine the fair value of EU lending with reference to commercial or government bonds.

    •   Furthermore, as there is no active market or similar transactions to compare with, the interest
        rate to be used by the EU for fair valuing its lending operations under the EFSM, BOP and other
        such loans, should be the interest rate charged.

    •   In addition, for these loans, there are compensating effects between loans and borrowings due to
        their back-to-back character. Thus, the effective interest for the loan equals the effective interest
        rate for the related borrowings. The transaction costs incurred by the EU and then recharged to
        the beneficiary of the loan are directly recognised in the statement of financial performance.

                                                      28
-----------------------Page 30 End-----------------------

                                 Annual accounts of the European Union 2018

Financial instruments are derecognised when the rights to receive cashflows from the investments have
expired or the EU has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership to another party.

Subsequent measurement

    a) Financial assets at fair value through surplus or deficit are subsequently carried at fair value.
       Gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of the ‘financial instruments at fair value
       through surplus or deficit’ category are included in the statement of financial performance in the
       period in which they arise.

    b) Loans and receivables are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method. In the
       case of loans granted on borrowed funds, the same effective interest rate is applied to both the
       loans and borrowings since these loans have the characteristics of 'back-to-back operations' and
       the differences between the loan and the borrowing conditions and amounts are not material. The
       transaction costs incurred by the EU and then recharged to the beneficiary of the loan are directly
       recognised in the statement of financial performance.

    c)   Held to maturity assets are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method. The EU
         currently holds no held to maturity investments.

    d) Available for sale financial assets are subsequently carried at fair value. Gains and losses arising
       from changes in the fair value of available for sale financial assets are recognised in the fair value
       reserve, except for translation differences on monetary assets, which are recognised in the
       statement of financial performance. When assets classified as available for sale financial assets
       are derecognised or impaired, the cumulative fair value adjustments previously recognised in the
       fair value reserve are recognised in the statement of financial performance. Interest on available
       for sale financial assets calculated using the effective interest method is recognised in the
       statement of financial performance. Dividends on available for sale equity instruments are
       recognised when the EU's right to receive payment is established.

The fair values of quoted investments in active markets are based on current bid prices. If the market for
a financial asset is not active (and for unlisted securities and over-the–counter derivatives), the EU
establishes a fair value by using valuation techniques. These include the use of recent arm’s length
transactions, reference to other instruments that are substantially the same, discounted cashflow
analysis, option pricing models and other valuation techniques commonly used by market participants.

Investments in Venture Capital Funds, classified as available for sale financial assets, which do not have a
quoted market price in an active market are valued at the attributable net asset value, which is
considered as an equivalent of their fair value.

In cases where the fair value of investments in equity instruments that do not have a quoted market
price in an active market cannot be reliably measured, these investments are valued at cost less
impairment losses.

Impairment of financial assets

A financial asset is impaired and a loss is recognised if, and only if, there is objective evidence of
impairment as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the asset and
that loss event (or events) has an impact on the estimated future cashflows of the financial asset that
can be reliably estimated. The EU assesses at each reporting date whether there is objective evidence
that a financial asset is impaired.

(a) Assets carried at amortised cost

If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss on loans and receivables or held-to-maturity
investments carried at amortised cost has been incurred, the amount of the loss is measured as the
difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cashflows
(excluding future credit losses that have not been incurred) discounted at the financial asset’s original
effective interest rate. The carrying amount of the asset is reduced and the amount of the loss is
recognised in the statement of financial performance. If a loan or held-to-maturity investment has a
variable interest rate, the discount rate for measuring any impairment loss is the current effective
interest rate determined under the contract. The calculation of the present value of the estimated future
cashflows of a collateralised financial asset reflects the cashflows that may result from foreclosure less
costs for obtaining and selling the collateral, whether or not foreclosure is probable. If, in a subsequent
period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an

                                                    29
-----------------------Page 31 End-----------------------

                                   Annual accounts of the European Union 2018

event occurring after the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised impairment loss is
reversed through the statement of financial performance.

(b) Assets carried at fair value

In the case of equity investments classified as available for sale financial assets, a significant or
permanent (prolonged) decline in the fair value of the security below its cost is considered in determining
whether the securities are impaired. If any such evidence exists for available for sale financial assets, the
cumulative loss – measured as the difference between the acquisition cost and the current fair value, less
any impairment loss on that financial asset previously recognised in the statement of financial
performance – is removed from reserves and recognised in the statement of financial performance.
Impairment losses recognised in the statement of financial performance on equity instruments are not
reversed through the statement of financial performance. If, in a subsequent period, the fair value of a
debt instrument classified as available for sale financial asset increases and the increase can be
objectively related to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised, the impairment loss is
reversed through the statement of financial performance.


1.5.6.    Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is determined using the first-in,
first-out (FIFO) method. The cost of finished goods and work in progress comprises raw materials, direct
labour, other directly attributable costs and related production overheads (based on normal operating
capacity). Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the
costs of completion and selling expenses. When inventories are held for distribution at no charge or for a
nominal charge, they are measured at the lower of cost and current replacement cost. Current
replacement cost is the cost the EU would incur to acquire the asset on the reporting date.


1.5.7.    Pre-financing amounts

Pre-financing is a payment intended to provide the beneficiary with a cash advance, i.e. a float. It may be
split into a number of payments over a period defined in the particular contract, decision, agreement or
basic legal act. The float or advance is either used for the purpose for which it was provided during the
period defined in the agreement or it is repaid. If the beneficiary does not incur eligible expenditure, they
have the obligation to return the pre-financing advance to the EU. The amount of the pre-financing may
be reduced (wholly or partially) by the acceptance of eligible costs (which are recognised as expenses).

Pre-financing is, on subsequent balance sheet dates, measured at the amount initially recognised on the
balance sheet less eligible expenses (including estimated amounts where necessary) incurred during the
period.

Interest on pre-financing is recognised as it is earned in accordance with the provisions of the relevant
agreement. An estimate of the accrued interest revenue, based on the most reliable information, is made
at the year-end and included on the balance sheet.

Other advances to Member States which originate from reimbursement by the EU of amounts paid as
advances by the Member States to their beneficiaries (including "financial instruments under shared
management") are recognised as assets and presented under the pre-financing heading. Other advances
to Member States are subsequently measured at the amount initially recognised on the balance sheet
less a best estimate of the eligible expenses incurred by final beneficiaries, calculated on the basis of
reasonable and supportable assumptions.

The EU contributions to the trust funds of the European Development Fund or other unconsolidated
entities are also classified as pre-financing since their purpose is to give a float to the trust fund to allow
it to finance specific actions defined under the trust fund's objectives. The EU contributions to trust funds
are measured at the initial amount of the EU contribution less eligible expenses, including estimated
amounts where necessary, incurred by the trust fund during the reporting period and allocated to the EU
contribution in accordance with the underlying agreement.

1.5.8.    Exchange receivables and non-exchange recoverables

As the EU accounting rules require a separate presentation of exchange and non-exchange transactions,
for the purpose of drawing up the accounts, receivables are defined as stemming from exchange
transactions and recoverables are defined as stemming from non-exchange transactions, i.e. when the
EU receives value from another entity without directly giving approximately equal value in exchange (for
example recoverables from Member States related to own resources).

Receivables from exchange transactions meet the definition of financial instruments and are thus
classified as loans and receivables and measured accordingly (see note 1.5.5). The financial instruments
notes disclosures concerning receivables from exchange transactions include accrued revenue and
deferred charges from exchange transactions, as they are not material. A general write-down based on
past experience is made for outstanding recovery orders not already subject to a specific write-down.

Recoverables from non-exchange transactions are carried at original amount (adjusted for interest and
penalties) less write-down for impairment. A write-down for impairment of recoverables from
non-exchange transactions is established when there is objective evidence that the EU will not be able to
collect all amounts due according to the original terms of recoverables from non-exchange transactions.
The amount of the write-down is the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the recoverable
amount. The amount of the write-down is recognised in the statement of financial performance. A general
write-down, based on past experience, is also made for outstanding recovery orders not already subject
to a specific write-down. See note 1.5.14 concerning the treatment of accrued revenue at year-end.
Amounts displayed and disclosed as recoverables from non-exchanges transactions are not financial
instruments, as they do not arise from a contract that would give rise to a financial liability or equity
instrument. However, in the notes to the financial statements recoverables from non-exchange
transactions are disclosed together with receivables from exchange transactions where appropriate.


1.5.9.    Cash and cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents are financial instruments and include cash at hand, deposits held at call or at
short notice with banks and other short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three
months or less.


1.5.10. Employee benefits

The accounting policy for employee benefits has been updated in line with the requirements of the
revised accounting rule EAR 12 Employee Benefits, effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January
2018, which is based on the new IPSAS 39 (Employee Benefits) published in July 2016. The main change,
arising from the revision of accounting rule 12, is the presentation of actuarial gains and losses as a
movement in net assets instead of in the statement of financial performance.

Accounting for defined benefit plans is complex because actuarial assumptions and judgement are
required to measure the obligation. In applying the revised accounting rule, the EU has reassessed the
judgements used, in particular, as regards to the estimate of the ultimate cost of the benefit attributed to
the employees. As a result of this exercise, the appropriateness of the use of the estimated active service
period of the employee as the basis for attributing benefits to periods of service was confirmed. The
benefits which the EU’s employees are entitled to are given under a single plan – although split in two
schemes – and they must be treated similarly so as to give a fair presentation of the situation and reflect
the economic reality.

The EU provides a set of benefits (emoluments and social security) to employees. For accounting
purposes these have to be classified into short term and post-employment benefits.

Short-term employee benefits

Short-term employee benefits are those benefits due to be settled before twelve months after the end of
the reporting period in which employees rendered the service, such as salaries, annual and paid sick
leaves, and other short-term allowances. Short-term employee benefits are recognised as an expense
when the related service is provided. A liability is recognised for the amount expected to be paid if the EU
has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay as a result of past service provided by the employee
and the obligation can be estimated reliably.



                                                    31
-----------------------Page 33 End-----------------------

                                      Annual accounts of the European Union 2018

Post-employment benefits

The EU grants a set of post-employment benefits to employees, which include retirement, invalidity and
survival pensions, as well as medical coverage (see note 2.9).

The EU provides its staff with a post-employment benefit plan that includes:

     i.    Pension Scheme of European Officials (PSEO): The benefits granted under this notionally funded12
           scheme relate to seniority, invalidity and survival, as well as, family allowances, death before
           retirement to those employees that work or worked in the EU Institutions, Agencies and other EU
           bodies or are survivors of deceased officials or pensioners. Staff contribute one third of the
           expected cost of these benefits from their salaries.

     ii.   Joint Sickness Insurance Scheme (JSIS): Under this scheme, the EU provides health coverage for
           staff of the European Commission, Institutions, Agencies and other EU bodies through the
           reimbursement of medical expenses. The benefits granted to the "inactives" of this scheme (i.e.
           pensioners, orphans, etc.) are classified as post-employment benefits.

The EU also provides post-employment benefits to members of the EU institutions via separate pension
schemes. These are shown under the heading other retirement benefit schemes. Under these schemes
the EU provides pension benefits to members of the Commission, Court of Justice and General Court,
Court of Auditors, Council, European Parliament, Ombudsman, Data Protection Supervisor, Civil Service
Tribunal. The EU provides health coverage to the members of the EU Institutions via the JSIS.

The above post-employment benefits qualify as defined benefit obligations of the EU and are calculated at
each reporting date by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in the
current and prior periods, discounting that amount and deducting the fair value of any plan assets. The
calculation of defined benefit obligation is performed annually using the projected unit credit method. The
present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash
outflows using interest rates of government bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the
benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension
liability.

The post-employment benefits provided to EU staff are incorporated in a single plan comprising both a
pension scheme (PSEO) and a sickness insurance scheme (JSIS), with the right to coverage under the
JSIS scheme being dependent on having acquired the right to coverage under the PSEO scheme. Under
the terms of this single plan, as set out in the Staff Regulation, certain entitlements, such as the right to
a deferred and reduced pension under the PSEO scheme, are acquired after 10 years of service.
However, the entitlements acquired under the single plan by the employee’s subsequent service are
materially higher than those initial entitlements as reflected by subsequent annually accrued pension
rights.

Therefore, in order to depict the economic substance of the underlying transaction required by the faithful
representation qualitative characteristic of financial reporting as outlined in both EAR 1 and the IPSAS
Conceptual Framework, the service cost incurred is accrued on a straight-line basis over staff’s estimated
active service period, i.e. the period from the date when service by the employee first leads to benefits
under the plan (whether or not the benefits are conditional on further service) until the date when further
service by the employee will lead to no material amount of further benefits under the plan, other than
from further salary increases. This approach is applied consistently to the benefits provided for under the
single plan.

Remeasurements of the net defined benefit liability comprise actuarial gains and losses and the return on
plan assets, and are recognised immediately in net assets.

The EU recognises the net interest expense (income) and other expenses related to the defined benefit
plans in the statement of financial performance within the caption ‘staff and pension costs’.




12
  The PSEO is a notional (virtual) fund with defined benefits, in which staff’s contributions serve to finance their future
pensions. Although there is no actual investment fund, the amount that would have been collected by such a fund is
considered to have been invested in the Member States’ long-term bonds and is reflected in the pension liability that is
registered in the annual accounts of the European Union. Member States jointly guarantee the payment of the benefits
pursuant to Article 83 of the Staff Regulations and Article 4(3) of the Treaty on European Union (see COM(2018) 829
for a detailed description of the scheme).

                                                           32
-----------------------Page 34 End-----------------------

                                   Annual accounts of the European Union 2018

When benefits provided are changed or curtailed, the resulting change in benefits that relates to past
service or the gain or loss on curtailment is recognised immediately in the statement of financial
performance. Gains and losses on settlement are recognised when the settlement occurs. Past service
cost is recognised immediately in the statement of financial performance, unless the changes are
conditional on the employees remaining in service for a specified period of time.


1.5.11. Provisions

Provisions are recognised when the EU has a present legal or constructive obligation towards third parties
as a result of past events, it is more likely than not that an outflow of resources will be required to settle
the obligation, and the amount can be reliably estimated. Provisions are not recognised for future
operating losses. The amount of the provision is the best estimate of the expenses expected to be
required to settle the present obligation at the reporting date. Where the provision involves a large
number of items, the obligation is estimated by weighting all possible outcomes by their associated
probabilities (“expected value” method).

Provisions for onerous contracts are measured at the present value of the lower of the expected cost of
terminating the contract and the expected net cost of continuing with the contract.


1.5.12. Financial liabilities

Financial liabilities are classified as financial liabilities at fair value through surplus or deficit, financial
liabilities carried at amortised cost or as financial guarantee liabilities.

Borrowings are composed of borrowings from credit institutions and debts evidenced by certificates. They
are recognised initially at fair value, being their issue proceeds (fair value of consideration received) net
of transaction costs incurred, then subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest
method; any difference between proceeds, net of transaction costs, and the redemption value is
recognised in the statement of financial performance over the period of the borrowings using the effective
interest method. In the case of loans granted on borrowed funds, the effective interest method may not
be applied to loans and borrowings, based on materiality considerations. The transaction costs incurred
by the EU and then recharged to the beneficiary of the loan are directly recognised in the statement of
financial performance.

Financial liabilities categorised at fair value through surplus or deficit include derivatives where fair value
is negative. They follow the same accounting treatment as financial assets at fair value through surplus
or deficit, see note 1.5.5.

Financial guarantee liabilities are initially recognised at fair value, being the premium received.
Subsequently, financial guarantee liabilities are measured at the higher of the best estimate of the
expenses expected to be required to settle the financial guarantee liability and the amount initially
recognised less, when appropriate, cumulative amortisation. The EU recognises a financial guarantee
liability when it receives consideration for granting of the guarantee, that is at market terms, or when the
fair value of the guarantee can be measured reliably. In case no active market for a directly equivalent
guarantee contract exists, the EU discloses the guarantee given as a contingent liability (see note 1.7.2)
or - when it is more likely than not that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation –
the EU recognises a provision (see note 1.5.11).

Financial liabilities are classified as non-current liabilities, except for maturities less than 12 months after
the balance sheet date.

EU trust funds that are considered as part of the Commission's operational activities are accounted for in
the Commission accounts and further consolidated in the EU annual accounts. Therefore, contributions
from other donors to the EU trust funds fulfil the criteria of revenues from non-exchange transactions
under conditions and they are presented as financial liabilities until the conditions attached to the
contributions transferred are met, i.e. eligible costs are incurred by the trust fund. The trust fund is
required to finance specific projects and return remaining funds at the time of winding-up. At the balance
sheet date the outstanding contribution liabilities are measured at contributions received less the
expenses incurred by the trust fund, including estimated amounts when necessary. For reporting
purposes the net expenses are allocated to the contributions of other donors in proportion to net
contributions paid as at 31 December. This allocation of contributions is only indicative. When the trust
fund is wound up the actual split of remaining resources will be decided by the trust fund board.

                                Annual accounts of the European Union 2018

1.5.13. Payables

A significant amount of the payables of the EU are unpaid cost claims from beneficiaries of grants or
other EU funding (non-exchange transactions). They are recorded as payables for the requested amount
when the cost claim is received. Upon verification and acceptance of the eligible costs, the payables are
valued at the accepted and eligible amount.

Payables arising from the purchase of goods and services are recognised at invoice reception for the
original amount and corresponding expenses are entered in the accounts when the supplies or services
are delivered and accepted by the EU.


1.5.14. Accrued and deferred revenue and charges

Transactions and events are recognised in the financial statements in the period to which they relate. At
year-end, if an invoice is not yet issued but the service has been rendered, the supplies have been
delivered by the EU or a contractual agreement exists (e.g. by reference to a treaty), an accrued revenue
will be recognised in the financial statements. In addition, at year-end, if an invoice is issued but the
services have not yet been rendered or the goods supplied have not yet been delivered, the revenue will
be deferred and recognised in the subsequent accounting period.

Expenses are also accounted for in the period to which they relate. At the end of the accounting period,
accrued expenses are recognised based on an estimated amount of the transfer obligation of the period.
The calculation of accrued expenses is done in accordance with detailed operational and practical
guidelines issued by the Commission which aim at ensuring that the financial statements provide a
faithful representation of the economic and other phenomena they purport to represent. By analogy, if
payment has been made in advance for services or goods that have not yet been received, the expense
will be deferred and recognised in the subsequent accounting period.


1.6.     STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE

1.6.1.   Revenue

REVENUE FROM NON-EXCHANGE TRANSACTIONS

The vast majority of the EU's revenue relates to non-exchange transactions:

GNI based resources and VAT resources

Revenue is recognised for the period for which the Commission sends out a call for funds to the Member
States claiming their contribution. They are measured at their “called amount”. As VAT and GNI resources
are based on estimates of the data for the budgetary year concerned, they may be revised as changes
occur until the final data are issued by the Member States. The effect of a change in estimate is included
when determining the net surplus or deficit for the period in which the change occurred.

Traditional own resources

Recoverables from non-exchange transactions and related revenues are recognised when the relevant
monthly "A" statements (including duties collected and amounts due that are guaranteed and not
contested) are received from the Member States. At the reporting date, revenue collected by the Member
States for the period but not yet paid to the Commission is estimated and recognised as accrued revenue.
The quarterly "B" statements (including duties neither collected nor guaranteed, as well as guaranteed
amounts that have been contested by the debtor) received from the Member States are recognised as
revenue less the collection costs to which they are entitled. In addition, a value reduction is recognised
for the amount of the estimated recovery gap.

Fines

Revenue from fines is recognised when the EU's decision imposing a fine has been taken and it is
officially notified to the addressee. If there are doubts about the undertaking's solvency, a value



                                                   34
-----------------------Page 36 End-----------------------

                                 Annual accounts of the European Union 2018

reduction on the entitlement is recognised. After the decision to impose a fine, the debtors have two
months from the date of notification:

    a) either to accept the decision, in which case they must pay the fine within the time limit laid down
       and the amount is definitively collected by the EU;

    b) or not to accept the decision, in which case they lodge an appeal under EU law.

However, even if appealed, the fine must be paid within the time limit of three months laid down as the
appeal does not have suspensory effect (Article 278 of the EU Treaty) or, under certain circumstances
and subject to the agreement of the Commission's Accounting Officer, the debtor may present a bank
guarantee for the amount instead.

If the undertaking appeals against the decision, and has already provisionally paid the fine, the amount is
disclosed as a contingent liability. However, since an appeal against an EU decision by the addressee
does not have suspensory effect, the cash received is used to clear the recoverable. If a guarantee is
received instead of payment, the fine remains as a recoverable. If it appears probable that the General
Court may not rule in favour of the EU, a provision is recognised to cover this risk. If a guarantee had
been given instead, then the recoverable outstanding is written-down as required. The accumulated
interest received by the Commission on the bank accounts where received payments are deposited is
recognised as revenue, and any contingent liability is increased accordingly.

Since 2010, all provisionally cashed fines are managed by the Commission in a specifically created fund
(BUFI) and invested in financial instruments.

REVENUE FROM EXCHANGE TRANSACTIONS

Revenue from the sale of goods and services is recognised when the significant risk and rewards of
ownership of the goods are transferred to the purchaser. Revenue associated with a transaction involving
the provision of services is recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the transaction at the
reporting date.

Interest revenue and expense

Interest revenue and expense are recognised in the statement of financial performance using the
effective interest method. This is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial asset or a
financial liability and of allocating the interest revenue or interest expense over the relevant period. When
calculating the effective interest rate, the EU estimates cashflows considering all contractual terms of the
financial instrument (for example prepayment options) but does not consider future credit losses. The
calculation includes all fees and points paid or received between parties to the contract that are an
integral part of the effective interest rate, transaction costs and all other premiums or discounts.

Once a financial asset or a group of similar financial assets has been written down as a result of an
impairment loss, interest revenue is recognised using the rate of interest to discount the future cashflows
for the purpose of measuring the impairment loss.

Revenue from dividends

Revenue from dividends and similar distributions is recognised when the right to receive payment is
established.


1.6.2.    Expenses

Expenses from non-exchange transactions account for the majority of the EU's expenses. They relate to
transfers to beneficiaries and can be of three types: entitlements, transfers under agreement and
discretionary grants, contributions and donations.

Transfers are recognised as expenses in the period during which the events giving rise to the transfer
occurred, as long as the nature of the transfer is allowed by regulation (Financial Regulation, Staff
Regulations, or other regulation) or an agreement has been signed authorising the transfer; any eligibility
criteria have been met by the beneficiary; and a reasonable estimate of the amount can be made.




                                                     35
-----------------------Page 37 End-----------------------

                                   Annual accounts of the European Union 2018

When a request for payment or cost claim is received and meets the recognition criteria, it is recognised
as an expense for the eligible amount. At year-end, incurred eligible expenses due to the beneficiaries
but not yet reported are estimated and recorded as accrued expenses.

Expenses from exchange transactions arising from the purchase of goods and services are recognised
when the supplies are delivered and accepted by the EU. They are valued at original invoice amount.
Furthermore, at the balance sheet date expenses related to the service delivered during the period for
which an invoice has not yet been received or accepted are estimated and recognised in the statement of
financial performance.


1.7.      CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES

1.7.1.    Contingent assets

A contingent asset is a possible asset that arises from past events and of which the existence will be
confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly
within the control of the EU. A contingent asset is disclosed when an inflow of economic benefits or
service potential is probable.


1.7.2.    Contingent liabilities

A contingent liability is a possible obligation that arises from past events and of which the existence will
be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly
within the control of the EU; or a present obligation that arises from past events but is not recognised
because: it is not probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits or service potential
will be required to settle the obligation or in the rare circumstances where the amount of the obligation
cannot be measured with sufficient reliability.


1.8.      CASHFLOW STATEMENT

Cashflow information is used to provide a basis for assessing the ability of the EU to generate cash and
cash equivalents, and its needs to utilise those cashflows.

The cashflow statement is prepared using the indirect method. This means that the economic result for
the financial year is adjusted for the effects of transactions of a non-cash nature, any deferrals or
accruals of past or future operating cash receipts or payments, and items of revenue or expense
associated with investing cashflows.

Cashflows arising from transactions in a foreign currency are recorded in the EU’s reporting currency
(Euro), by applying to the foreign currency amount the exchange rate between the euro and the foreign
currency at the date of the cashflow.

The cashflow statement reports cashflows during the period classified by operating and investing
activities (the EU does not have financing activities).

Operating activities are the activities of the EU that are not investing activities. These are the majority of
the activities performed. Loans granted to beneficiaries (and the related borrowings, when applicable) are
not considered as investing (or financing) activities as they are part of the general objectives and thus
daily operations of the EU.

Investing activities are the acquisition and disposal of intangible assets and property, plant and
equipment and of other investments which are not included in cash equivalents. Investing activities do
not include loans granted to beneficiaries. The objective is to show the real investments made by the EU.

2.2.      PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT

The Space assets category covers operational fixed assets related to the two EU space programmes: the
Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), i.e. Galileo and EGNOS, and the Copernicus European Earth
observation programme, while assets of the space systems which are not yet operational are included
under the Assets under construction heading.

For Galileo, four new satellites have been added to the operational constellation in 2018 bringing it up to
22 satellites. The Galileo operational fixed assets, covering both satellites and ground installations,
amounted to EUR 2 410 million at 31 December 2018, net of depreciation (2017: EUR 2 276 million). The
remaining assets under construction totalling EUR 1 324 million (2017: EUR 1 026 million) include the
four satellites launched in July 2018 for which the in-orbit testing had not yet been completed at the
balance sheet date. The development of the Galileo system will continue until the system reaches its full
operational capacity. When completed, the Galileo constellation will comprise 24 operational satellites and
6 spares.

Regarding Copernicus, two new satellites (Sentinel 5P & 3B) became operational in 2018, in addition to
the five other Copernicus operational satellites, increasing the total value of Copernicus operational fixed
assets to EUR 1 455 million (2017: EUR 1 140 million), net of accumulated depreciation. Another
EUR 1 207 million related to Copernicus satellites is recognised as assets under construction (2017:
EUR 1 443 million).

Fixed assets related to the European Geostationary Navigation Overlay System (EGNOS) ground
infrastructure of EUR 52 million (2017: EUR 67 million) are also included under the Space assets heading.
In addition, EGNOS assets under construction amount to EUR 130 million (2017: EUR 52 million).

The assets related to the EU space programmes are being built with the assistance of the European
Space Agency (ESA).

2.3.      INVESTMENTS ACCOUNTED FOR USING THE EQUITY
          METHOD

The participation of the EU, represented by the Commission, in the European Investment Fund (EIF) is
treated as an associate using the equity method of accounting. The EIF is the EU's financial institution
specialising in providing risk capital and guarantees to Small and Medium-sized Entities (SMEs). The EIF
is located in Luxembourg and operates as a private-public partnership, whose members are the European
Investment Bank (EIB), the EU and a group of financial institutions. At 31 December 2018, the EU held
29.7 % of ownership interests in the EIF (2017: 29.7 %) and 29.7 % of the voting rights (2017:
29.7 %). In accordance with its statutes, the EIF is required to allocate to a statutory reserve at least
20 % of its annual net result until the aggregate reserve amounts to 10 % of subscribed capital. This
reserve is not available for distribution.

                                                                                              EUR million

EUR 1 365 million (2017: EUR 1 333 million) and investments in the EIB Unitary Fund (money market
fund) of EUR 85 million (2017: EUR 251 million). The debt securities and units in the EIB Unitary Fund
are mainly used to temporarily invest the amounts allocated to the EU guarantee and risk-sharing
instruments until they are used to satisfy the guarantee calls.

BUFI investments
Provisionally cashed fines related to competition cases are allocated to a dedicated fund (BUFI Fund -
'Budget Fines' Fund) and invested by the Commission in debt instruments categorised as available for
sale financial assets.

ECSC in Liquidation

Regarding the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) in liquidation, all available for sale financial
assets are debt securities denominated in EUR and quoted in an active market.

European Bank for Reconstruction and Development

The EU holds a financial investment in the capital of the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development (EBRD), in which at 31 December 2018 the number of shares held were 90 044
(2017: 90 044 shares), representing 3 % of the total subscribed share capital. The EU subscribed for a
total amount of EUR 900 million of share capital, out of which EUR 713 million is currently uncalled.
According to the Agreement establishing EBRD, the shareholders have some contractual restrictions such
as the fact that the shares are not transferable and their redemption is capped at the maximum of the
original purchase cost.

The EU measures the investment in EBRD at fair value. The original purchase cost is considered to be the
best estimate of the fair value, in particular due to contractual restrictions referred to above. Although
EBRD's shares are not quoted on any stock exchange market, there are recent transactions in the
investee's equity (issuance of capital at par value), indicating that the cost is the best estimate of the fair
value in this situation.


GUARANTEE FUNDS FOR BUDGETARY GUARANTEES

EFSI Guarantee Fund
Pursuant to the EFSI Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2015/2017), the EFSI Guarantee Fund has been
established to provide a liquidity cushion against potential losses incurred by the EIB in relation to its
financing and investment operations eligible for the EFSI EU guarantee under the EFSI Agreement - see
note 4.1.1. The EFSI Guarantee Fund is financed by contributions from the EU budget. It is also endowed
by returns on guarantee fund resources invested, revenues received by the EU as remuneration for the
guarantee under the EFSI Agreement, and amounts recovered by the EIB from defaulting debtors in
respect of previous guarantee calls. The fund is managed by the Commission, which is authorised to
invest the assets of the EFSI Guarantee Fund on the financial markets in accordance with the principle of
sound financial management following appropriate prudential rules. The EFSI Guarantee Fund started its
operations in April 2016. In accordance with the EFSI Regulation, as amended in 2017 (Regulation
(EU 2017/2396)), it will be progressively provisioned and shall gradually reach EUR 9.1 billion, i.e. 35 %
of the total EU EFSI guarantee obligations.

Guarantee Fund for external actions
The Guarantee Fund for external actions covers loans guaranteed by the EU budget, in particular EIB
lending operations outside the EU financed from the EIB's own resources and loans under macro-financial
assistance (MFA) and Euratom loans outside the EU – see note 4.1.1. It is a long-term instrument (non-
current part: EUR 2 275 million) managed by the EIB and intended to cover any defaulting loans
guaranteed by the EU. The Fund is endowed by payments from the EU budget, the proceeds from interest
on investments made from the Fund's assets, and sums recovered from defaulting debtors for whom the
Fund has had to activate its guarantee. The Fund should be maintained at a target amount corresponding
to 9 % of the guaranteed loans outstanding at year-end. The difference between the target amount and
the value of the Fund's assets at year-end shall be covered from the EU budget in year N+2, while any
surplus is paid back to the EU budget.

EFSD Guarantee Fund
Pursuant to the EFSD Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2017/1601 of the European Parliament and of the
Council of 26 September 2017), the EFSD Guarantee Fund has been established to provide a liquidity
cushion to be used in the event of a call on the Union guarantee given pursuant to the relevant EFSD
guarantee agreements. The EFSD Guarantee Fund is financed by contributions from the EU budget and
from contributions from the 11th EDF to the EU budget and voluntary contributions from Member States
and other contributors. The fund is also endowed by returns on invested resources, amounts recovered
from defaulting debtors, revenues and any other payments received by the EU in accordance with the
EFSD guarantee agreements. The fund is managed directly by the Commission, which is authorised to
invest the fund’s assets in accordance with the principle of sound financial management following
appropriate prudential rules. The first EU budget contributions to the EFSD Guarantee Fund were received
in August 2018. Total payments received in 2018 amount to EUR 275.1 million, of which EUR 9 million is
invested in available for sale financial assets as at 31 December 2018, while another EUR 325 million
(2017: EUR 275 million) have been committed but not yet paid and is included in the amount disclosed
as RAL in note 5.1. The EFSD Guarantee Fund will be progressively provisioned and gradually reach EUR
750 million, i.e. 50 % of total future EFSD guarantee obligations covered by the EU budget, and may be
further increased by other contributions.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS FINANCED BY THE EU BUDGET

Horizon 2020
Under the EU Regulation establishing Horizon 2020 – the Framework Programme for Research and
Innovation (2014-2020), new financial instruments have been established in order to enhance access to
finance to entities engaged in research and innovation (R&I). These instruments are: the InnovFin Loan
and Guarantee Service for R&I under which the Commission shares the financial risk related to a portfolio
of new financing operations entered into by the EIB; the InnovFin SME Guarantee including the SME
Initiative Uncapped Guarantee Instrument (SIUGI) – guarantee facilities managed by the EIF providing
guarantees and counter-guarantees to the financial intermediaries for the new portfolios of loans (under
SIUGI the Commission shares the financial risk related to the guarantee given with Member States, EIF
and EIB); and the InnovFin Equity Facility for R&I providing for investments in venture capital funds and
managed by the EIF.

Risk-Sharing Finance Facility
The Risk-Sharing Finance Facility (RSFF) is managed by the EIB and the Commission's investment
portfolio is used to provision financial risk for loans and guarantees given by the EIB to eligible research
projects. In total, an EU budget of up to EUR 1 billion was allocated to the RSFF under the 2007-2013
MFF. Under the 2014-2020 MFF, there are no new budget contributions foreseen for the RSFF. The EU
overall risk is limited to the amount it contributes to the Facility.

Connecting Europe Facility
Pursuant to Regulation (EU) No 1316/2013, the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) debt instrument has
been established with the objective to facilitate infrastructure projects’ access to financing in the sectors
of transport, telecommunications and energy. It is managed by the EIB under an agreement with the EU.
The CEF debt financial instrument is the continuity of the Loan Guarantee Instrument for TEN-T projects
(LGTT) and of the pilot phase of the Project Bond Initiative (PBI). The LGTT and the PBI Portfolio were
merged into the CEF financial instrument with effect from 1 January 2016. It offers risk-sharing for debt
financing in the form of senior and subordinated debt or guarantee as well as support for project bonds.

EU SME Equity Facilities
These are equity instruments financed by the COSME, the CIP and MAP programmes and the Technology
Transfer Pilot Project, under the trusteeship of the EIF, supporting the creation and financing of EU SMEs
in their early (start-up) and growth stages by investing in suitable specialised venture capital funds.

The EU enters into foreign currency forward contracts in order to hedge the foreign currency risk related
to USD denominated debt securities held in the EFSI Guarantee Fund. Under the foreign currency forward
contracts, the EU shall deliver the contractually agreed notional amount in foreign currency ('pay leg'), as
presented in the table above, and will receive the notional amount in EUR ('receive leg') at the maturity
date. Such derivative contracts are measured at fair value at the balance sheet date and classified as
either financial assets or financial liabilities at fair value through surplus or deficit depending on whether
their fair value is positive or negative.

The EFSI guarantee given by the EU to the EIB Group in relation to the portfolios of equity investments is
classified as a derivative financial instrument and accounted for as a financial asset or financial liability at
fair value through surplus or deficit, see note 4.1.1. At 31 December 2018, the amount of the underlying
equity investments disbursed by the EIB and EIF amounted to EUR 674 million and the fair value of the
EU guarantee on the EFSI equity portfolios totalled EUR 14 million.

The nominal value of loans for financial assistance at 31 December 2018, including ECSC in Liquidation
loans, total EUR 53 206 million (2017: EUR 54 093 million). The change in carrying amount corresponds
to the change in accrued interests.
EFSM enables the granting of financial assistance to a Member State in difficulties or seriously threatened
by severe difficulties caused by exceptional circumstances beyond its control. The assistance may take
the form of a loan or credit line. The ECOFIN Council conclusions of 9 May 2010 restrict the facility to
EUR 60 billion but the legal limit restricts the outstanding amount of loans or credit lines to the margin
available under the own resources ceiling. Borrowings related to loans disbursed under the EFSM are
guaranteed by the EU budget. It is not foreseen that the EFSM will engage in new financing programmes
or enter into new loan facility agreements. During the year ended 31 December 2018, both beneficiary

                                  Annual accounts of the European Union 2018

countries – Ireland and Portugal – have requested a maturity extension in respect to their loans falling
due in 2018 for the amount of EUR 3.9 billion and EUR 0.6 billion, respectively.
The BOP facility, a policy-based financial instrument, provides medium-term financial assistance to
Member States of the EU that have not adopted the Euro. It enables the granting of loans to Member
States who are experiencing, or are seriously threatened by, difficulties in their balance of payments or
capital movements. The maximum outstanding amount of loans granted under the instrument is limited
to EUR 50 billion. Borrowings related to these BOP loans are guaranteed by the EU budget.
MFA is a form of financial aid extended by the EU to partner countries experiencing a balance of payment
crisis. It takes the form of medium/long term loans or grants or an appropriate combination of both and
generally complements financing provided in the context of an IMF-supported adjustment and reform
program. These loans are guaranteed by the Guarantee Fund for external actions. During the year ended
31 December 2018, further disbursements of loans under MFA for a total amount of EUR 515 million were
provided, being EUR 500 million to Ukraine and EUR 15 million to Georgia – see also note 4.1.2.
The European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom, represented by the Commission) lends money to
both Member States and non-Member States, and to entities of both, to finance projects relating to
energy installations. Guarantees from third-parties of EUR 254 million (2017: EUR 250 million) have been
received to cover Euratom loans - see note 4.1.2.

ECSC in Liquidation loans are not loans for financial assistance but promissory notes in order to keep the
cash flows in parallel with the borrowings. However, similar to the loans for financial assistance, they
were granted on borrowed funds in accordance with articles 54 and 56 of the ECSC Treaty for project
financing.

Nominal value of other loans at 31 December 2018 total EUR 617 million (2017: EUR 561 million). Loans
with special conditions are granted at preferential rates as part of co-operation with non-Member States.
Term deposits include mainly amounts with maturity between 3 and 12 months that do not meet the
definition of cash equivalents.

Subrogated loans are defaulted loans which were granted by the EIB and guaranteed by the EU budget,
for which all rights have been subrogated to the EU following the payment from the Guarantee Fund for
external actions or the EFSI Guarantee Fund. These loans are fully impaired for an amount of
EUR 579 million (2017: EUR 432 million). Guarantee calls, which occurred in 2018, were partially covered
by financial provisions made in previous years. Under the relevant agreements between the EU and the
EIB, recovery proceedings are undertaken by the EIB on behalf of the EU with an aim to recover any
sums due.

The level of pre-financing amounts in the various programmes must be sufficient to ensure the necessary
funding for the beneficiary to start the project, while also safeguarding the financial interests of the EU
and taking into consideration legal, operational and cost-effectiveness constraints. The increase in the
total amount of pre-financing mainly relates to the increase in ’’other advances to member states’’ (see
note 2.5.2).

Pre-financing represents money paid out, and thus implementation of payment appropriations. As
explained in note 1.5.7, these are advances and so not yet expensed. Thus while pre-financing reduces
outstanding RAL (see note 5.1) it represents expenses still to be recognised in the statement of financial
performance.

                                 Annual accounts of the European Union 2018

For shared management, almost all pre-financing amounts relate to the current programming period.
There is an initial pre-financing which will not be cleared before the end of the period and is accounted for
as non-current. There is also an annual pre-financing which is cleared on an annual basis and is
accounted for as current. EUR 10 billion of new pre-financing has been paid in 2018. The pre-financing
amounts related to shared management are stable compared to 2017 except for a decrease in the
amounts under ‘’other’’ shared management. This relates to the European Union Solidarity Fund
(amounts for support to reconstruction in Italy following the 2016/2017 earthquakes there). These
amounts were paid as pre-financing in 2017 and expensed in 2018.

For direct management, the pre-financing amounts relate mainly to Horizon 2020 and the Connecting
Europe Facility.

For indirect management, the pre-financing covers mainly internal policies programmes like Erasmus,
Galileo and EGNOS, but also instruments related to external relations like ENI (European Neighbourhood
Instrument), DCI (Development Cooperation Instrument) and Humanitarian Aid.

Guarantees received in respect of pre-financing

These are guarantees that the Commission requests from beneficiaries that are not Member States in
certain cases when paying out advance payments (pre-financing). There are two values to disclose for
this type of guarantee, the “nominal” and the “on-going” values. For the nominal value, the generating
event is linked to the existence of the guarantee. For the on-going value, the guarantee’s generating
event is the pre-financing payment and/or subsequent clearings. At 31 December 2018 the nominal value
of guarantees received in respect of pre-financing amounted to EUR 516 million while the on-going value
of those guarantees was EUR 420 million (2017: EUR 620 million and EUR 462 million respectively).

Certain pre-financing amounts paid out under the 7th Research Framework Programme for research and
technological development (FP7) and under Horizon 2020 are effectively covered by a Participants
Guarantee Fund (PGF). The PGF is a mutual benefit instrument set up to cover the risks relating to non-
payment of amounts by the beneficiaries during the implementation of the indirect actions of FP7 and
Horizon 2020. All participants of indirect actions receiving a grant from the EU contribute 5 % of the total
amount received to the PGF's capital.

At 31 December 2018, pre-financing amounts covered by the PGF totalled EUR 2 billion (2017:
EUR 1.9 billion). The EU (represented by the Commission) acts as an executive agent of the participants
of the PGF, but the fund is owned by the participants.

At year-end, the PGF had total assets of EUR 2.1 billion (2017: EUR 2.0 billion). The assets of the PGF
also include financial assets that are managed by the Directorate-General for Economic and Financial
Affairs of the Commission. As the PGF is a separate entity the assets of the fund are not consolidated in
these EU annual accounts.

Advances to Member States for financial instruments under shared management

Under the framework of the European Structural and Investment Funds (ESIF) programmes, it is possible
to make advance payments from the EU budget to Member States so as to allow them to contribute to
financial instruments (i.e. loans, equity investments or guarantees). These financial instruments are set
up and managed under the responsibility of the Member States, not the Commission. Nevertheless,
monies that are unused by these instruments at year-end are the property of the EU (as with all pre-
financing) and are thus treated as an asset on the EU’s balance sheet.

                                Annual accounts of the European Union 2018

2014-2020 Period:

Under cohesion policy out of EUR 5 790 million paid, it is estimated that EUR 3 590 million was unused at
31 December 2018. This includes the contribution of the Member States to the SME Initiative, an
instrument aimed at stimulating additional lending by the banking sector to SMEs (EUR 1 213 million
paid, out of which EUR 391 million is estimated as unused).

For rural development, EUR 83 million remained unused at year-end.

2007-2013 Period:

All amounts related to the cohesion policy are considered to have been either implemented or re-
allocated to other measures, therefore no assets remain on the balance sheet at 31 December 2018. It
should be noted that the actual implementation by the various instruments will be reviewed as part of the
closure process of the programmes.

Aid Schemes

Similar to the above, advances paid by the Member States for various aid schemes (state aid, market
measures of EAGF or investment measures of EAFRD) that were not used at year-end are recorded as
assets (advances) on the EU's balance sheet. The Commission has estimated the value of these advances
based on information provided by the Member States; the resulting amounts are included under the Aid
Schemes sub-heading above.

2014-2020 Period:

The unused amounts at year-end were estimated at EUR 1 477 million for cohesion policy and
EUR 1 171 million for agriculture and rural development.

2007-2013 Period:

It is estimated that EUR 195 million paid in the context of rural development remains unused at the end
of 2018.

The non-current amounts due from Member States relate mainly to non-executed conformity clearance
decisions for the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund (EAGF) as well as for the European Agricultural
Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD). The amounts related to these decisions are being recovered in
annual instalments.

Own resources recoverables

'A accounts' refers to the monthly statements where the Member States communicate the established
Traditional Own Resources (TOR) entitlements to the Commission but not yet recovered. TOR are
composed of customs duties and sugar levies, collected by Member States on behalf of the Commission.

For 2018, the ‘A accounts’ figure contains TOR from the infringement case explained below as well as
from inspection reports. The increase in the heading ‘A accounts’ is driven by these cases. As late
payment interest of EUR 1.3 billion is applicable, those amounts are therefore also reported in these
annual accounts (see notes 2.6.2 and 3.7).

Concerning the infringement case, on 8 March 2018, the European Commission sent a letter of formal
notice (Infringement No 2018/2008) to the United Kingdom (UK) because it refused to make customs
duties available to the EU budget, as required by EU law. In view of a lack of a satisfactory reply from the
UK, the Commission sent a Reasoned Opinion on 24 September 2018 and decided on 19 December 2018
to refer the case to the Court of Justice of the EU. The UK replied to the Reasoned Opinion on
11 February 2019. This reply was again considered unsatisfactory and the Commission confirmed on
6 March 2019 its decision to refer the infringement to the Court of Justice of the EU. The application was
lodged on 7 March 2019. A 2017 OLAF report had found that importers in the UK evaded a large amount


                                                    48
-----------------------Page 50 End-----------------------

                                  Annual accounts of the European Union 2018

of customs duties by using fictitious and false invoices and incorrect customs value declarations at
importation. Based on a methodology developed by OLAF and JRC and on the information available, the
Commission estimates that the infringement of EU legislation by the UK resulted, during the period
November 2011 to October 2017, in losses to the EU budget amounting to EUR 2.1 billion (net, i.e. after
deducting the collection costs to be retained by the UK from the gross amount of EUR 2.7 billion). The UK
does not agree on the methodology used by the Commission to estimate the above losses.

In addition, the Commission included in the accounts a management estimate of EUR 0.7 billion (of which
the largest part being applicable interest) for established customs duties. The UK does not agree with this
amount.

‘Separate accounts’ refers to established entitlements that have not been included in the 'A accounts',
because they have not been recovered by Member States and no security has been provided (or if
security has been provided but the amounts are contested). These entitlements are subject to
impairment based on information provided every year by the Member States.

‘Own resources to be received’ refers to recoverables as a result of the amending budget No 6/2018
adopted on 12 December 2018. The amounts were to be entered by Member States on the first working
day of January 2019.

EAGF and Rural Development recoverables

This item primarily covers the amounts owed by Member States at 31 December 2018, as declared and
certified by the Member States as at 15 October 2018. An estimation is made for the recoverables arising
after this declaration and up to 31 December 2018. The Commission also estimates a write-down for the
amounts owed by beneficiaries that are unlikely to be recovered. The fact that such an adjustment is
made does not mean that the Commission is waiving future recovery of these amounts. A deduction of
20 % is also included in the adjustment and corresponds to what Member States are allowed to retain to
cover administrative costs.

The provisional payments mainly relate to cash receipts from companies that have nevertheless initiated
an appeal or still have the option to appeal against the fine decisions at EU courts. A contingent liability is
disclosed for the possibility to pay back these amounts to the companies (see note 4.1.4).

Fined companies who have launched or are planning to launch an appeal have an option to either make
provisional payments or to provide bank guarantees to the Commission. For EUR 9 354 million (2017:
EUR 4 004 million) of fines not paid at year-end, the Commission has accepted guarantees.

The amounts written down due to impairment reflect the Commission's case-by-case assessment of fines
amounts not cashed or not covered with a guarantee, which the Commission expects not to recover.

The increase in the competition fines recoverables is mainly due to two significant fines (totalling
EUR 5 339 million) where the companies concerned covered the fine with Commission accepted bank
guarantees.

Other accrued income includes EUR 1 146 million that the Commission expects           to recover from the
Member States in the area of cohesion. The recovery will be made as a result of       the examination and
acceptance of the annual accounts submitted by the Member States on 15 February       2019. This procedure
for the acceptance of Member States' annual accounts has been introduced for          the first time in the
cohesion area for the programming period 2014-2020.

2.8.1.     Bank accounts for budget implementation

This heading covers the funds which the Commission keeps in its bank accounts in each Member State
and EFTA country (treasury or central bank), as well as in commercial bank current accounts, imprest
accounts and petty cash. The treasury balance at the end of 2018 is due to the following main elements:

    •    As regards own resources, the end of year treasury balance includes EUR 0.75 billion paid in
         advance by some of the Member States in relation to amending budget 6 adopted in 2018.

    •    An amount of EUR 1.4 billion of fines imposed by the Commission for breach of competition rules,
         definitively cashed in 2018 and not yet included in any amending budget is also part of the year-
         end treasury balance.

    •    The treasury balance also includes assigned revenue and other payment appropriations of
         EUR 7.4 billion.


2.8.2.     Cash belonging to financial instruments

Amounts shown under this heading primarily concern cash equivalents managed by fiduciaries on behalf
of the Commission for the purpose of implementing particular financial instrument programmes funded
by the EU budget and cash and cash equivalents held in the guarantee funds relating to budgetary
guarantees (see note 2.4.1). The cash belonging to financial instruments and guarantee funds can only
be used in the programmes concerned.


2.8.3.     Cash relating to fines

This is cash received in connection with fines issued by the Commission for which the case is still open.
These amounts are kept in specific deposit accounts that are not used for any other activities. Where an
appeal has been lodged or when it is unknown if an appeal will be made by the other party, the
underlying amount is shown as contingent liability in note 4.1.4.

Since 2010, all new provisionally cashed fines are managed by the Commission in the BUFI fund and
invested in financial instruments categorised as available for sale (see note 2.4.1).

The increase in the total employee benefits liability is primarily due to an increase in the net liability of
the Pension Scheme of European Officials. The rights accrued during the year due to service are higher
than the benefits paid out during the year. In addition to this, there is an annual interest cost (unwinding
of the liability discounting) as well as actuarial losses from experience where a significant amount relates
to the improvement mentioned in note 2.9.1.


2.9.1.    Pension Scheme of European Officials

This defined benefit obligation represents the present value of expected future payments that the EU is
required to make so as to settle the pension obligations resulting from employee service in the current
and prior periods. The scheme is ongoing, and as such, all payments required to be made from the
scheme on an annual basis are included in the EU budget each year.

In accordance with Article 83 of the Staff Regulations, the payment of the benefits provided for in the
staff pension scheme constitutes a charge to the EU's budget. The scheme is notionally funded, and the
Member States guarantee the payment of these benefits collectively. A compulsory pension contribution
is deducted from the basic salaries of active members, currently 10.0 %. These contributions are treated
as budget revenue of the year and contribute to the funding of EU expenditure in general, see also note
3.6.

The liabilities of the pension scheme were assessed on the basis of the number of staff and retired staff
at 31 December 2018 and on the rules of the Staff Regulations applicable at this date. This valuation was
carried out in accordance with the methodology of IPSAS 39 (and therefore also EU accounting rule 12).
As was already noted in the 2017 annual accounts, the relevant Commission services have been working
to strengthen data collection methods, as well as improving assumptions and calculation methods. One
result of this work has been a more precise valuation of the liability in relation to the pensions of
surviving persons (i.e. where the member is deceased) using the most up to date actuarial practice. The
impact of this improved method on the 2018 liability is a EUR 2.1 billion increase. Had this method been
used in 2017, that liability would have been EUR 2.3 billion higher compared to the previous method
used.


2.9.2.    Other retirement benefit schemes

This refers to the liability relating to the pension obligations towards Members and former Members of the
Commission, the Court of Justice (and General Court) and the Court of Auditors, the Council, the
Ombudsman, the European Data Protection Supervisor, and the European Union Civil Service Tribunal.
Also included under this heading is a liability relating to the pensions of Members of the European
Parliament.


2.9.3.    Joint Sickness Insurance Scheme

In addition to the above retirement benefit schemes, a valuation is made for the estimated liability that
the EU has regarding the Joint Sickness Insurance Scheme (JSIS) in relation to healthcare costs which


                                                    52
-----------------------Page 54 End-----------------------

                                 Annual accounts of the European Union 2018

must be paid during post-activity periods (net of their contributions). As stated in note 1.5.10, the
calculation of this liability takes account of the full active service period, ensuring that both the pension
and the sickness insurance schemes of the staff’s post-employment plan are accounted for consistently.
Taking into account the obligation to faithfully present the economic substance of the underlying situation
as required by both EAR and IPSAS, we have not interpreted IPSAS 39 in a stricter sense when
attributing the benefits to the periods of service. If one were to accrue the service cost for the JSIS
scheme fully over 10 years for all officials, as opposed to the period of active service of the employee, the
impact of such an approach on the defined benefit obligation at year-end would be an increase of
EUR 3 billion. However, as already indicated, this stricter approach would not be compatible with the
qualitative characteristic of faithful representation, and thus would not be deemed to provide reliable
information in accordance with EAR 1 and the IPSAS Conceptual Framework. This estimate is highly
sensitive to the evolution of current staff administrative status (in particular the number of fixed-term
contract members assumed to become officials in the future).

Movement in present value of employee benefits defined benefit obligation

The present value of the defined benefit obligation is the discounted expected future payments required
to settle the obligation resulting from employee service in the current and prior periods.

An analysis of the current year movement in the defined benefit obligation is presented below:

Current service cost is the increase in the present value of the defined benefit obligation arising from
current members' service in the current period.

Interest cost refers to the interest cost i.e. the increase during the period in the present value of the
defined benefit obligation because the benefits are one period closer to settlement.

Actuarial gains and losses from experience refer to the effects of differences between the previous
actuarial assumptions for 2018 and what has actually occurred in 2018. This amount includes the
improvement mentioned in note 2.9.1.

Actuarial gains and losses from actuarial assumptions (demographic and financial like discount rates and
expected salary increases) arise where these assumptions are updated in order to reflect changes in the
underlying conditions.

Benefits (for example, pensions or medical cost reimbursements) are paid during the year according to
the rules of the scheme. These benefits paid lead to a decrease in the defined benefit obligation.

Mortality rates for 2017 and 2018 are based on the EU Civil Servants Life Table - EULT 2018.

The nominal discount rate is determined as the value of the Euro zero-coupon yield (with a maturity of 20
years as of December 2018 for the Pension Scheme of European Officials (PSEO), and 25 years for the
Joint Sickness Insurance Scheme). The inflation rate used is the expected inflation rate over the
equivalent period. It must be determined empirically, based on prospective values as expressed by index-
linked bonds on the European financial markets. The real discount rate is calculated from the nominal
discount rate and the expected long-term inflation rate.

Sensitivity analyses

The sensitivity analysis is based on simulations which change, ceteris paribus, the value of the concerned
assumptions and observing how the model reacts.

Provisions are reliably estimated amounts, arising from past events, that will probably have to be paid by
the EU budget in the future.

Legal cases

This is the estimate of amounts that will probably have to be paid out after the year-end in relation to a
number of on-going legal cases.

Nuclear site dismantlement

As of 2017 the basis for the provision was updated as per the "JRC Decommissioning & Waste
Management Programme Strategy (D&WMP) – Updated in 2017". The review of the strategy, along with
budget and staff needs, was conducted together with the independent D&WMP Expert Group. It
represents the best available estimate of the budget and staff needed to complete the decommissioning
of the JRC sites of Ispra, Geel, Karlsruhe and Petten.

In accordance with the EU accounting rules, this provision is indexed for inflation and then discounted to
its net present value (using the Euro swap curve). At 31 December 2018, this resulted in a provision of
EUR 1 933 million, split between amounts expected to be used in 2018 (EUR 31 million) and afterwards
(EUR 1 902 million).

It must be noted that major uncertainties, inherent to the long term planning of nuclear
decommissioning, could affect this estimate, which could significantly increase in the future. The main
sources of uncertainty are related to the end state of the decommissioned site, nuclear materials, waste
management and disposal aspects, incomplete or lacking definition of national regulatory frames,
complicated and time-consuming licensing process and future developments of the decommissioning
industrial market.

Financial provisions

These concern mainly provisions, which represent the estimated losses that will be incurred in relation to
the guarantees given under different financial instruments, where entrusted entities are empowered to
issue guarantees in their own name but on behalf of and at the risk of the EU. The financial risk of the EU
linked to the guarantees is capped and financial assets are gradually provisioned to cover for the future
guarantee calls. This heading also includes provisions for outstanding loans to Syria issued by the EIB
under its external lending mandate and thus guaranteed by the EU via the Guarantee Fund for external
actions. Non-current financial provisions are discounted to their net present value.

The increase of the financial provision relates to the increase of the volume of guaranteed operations
under H2020 and COSME financial instruments.

Borrowings mainly include debts evidenced by certificates amounting to EUR 53 725 million (2017:
EUR 54 674 million). The changes in carrying amount correspond to the change in accrued interests.

Aside from ECSC in liquidation, the repayment of the above borrowings are ultimately guaranteed by the
EU budget – see note 4.1.2, and by extension by each Member State.

Guarantee on equity portfolio

Guarantees given on equity portfolio are classified as financial liabilities at fair value through surplus or
deficit since they do not meet the definition of a financial guarantee liability – see note 1.5.12.
As at 31 December 2018 this heading relates to a guarantee provided by the EU under the H2020
financial instruments (see note 2.4.1) to the EIB Group for portfolios of equity operations. The EU
financial liability is measured based on the value of the underlying investments.

Foreign exchange option

As at 31 December 2018 the EU holds a derivative financial instrument (Foreign exchange option – put
spread type of option) in which it covers the devaluation of the foreign exchange currency (UHA) related
to loans given by financial institutions to SMEs in Ukraine so as to enhance the access to financing, as
well as the attractiveness of the loan conditions in Ukraine. Under the terms of the contract, the EU
provides its partners with an option to call, for each eligible loan, up to a maximum of 30 %, for an EU
contribution in the case of devaluation of the ratio UHA/EUR.

2.11.3. Financial guarantee liabilities

The EFSI guarantee on the debt portfolio disbursed by the EIB under the EFSI Innovation and
Infrastructure window (IIW) is classified as a financial guarantee liability. At 31 December 2018 the EFSI
financial guarantee liability totals EUR zero, as the revenues to be received under the guarantee exceed
expected losses (see note 4.1.1).

Payables include invoices and cost claims received but not yet paid at year-end. They are initially
recognised at the time of the reception of the invoices / cost claims for the requested amounts. The
payables are subsequently adjusted to reflect only the amounts accepted following review of costs, and
the amounts estimated to be eligible. The amounts estimated to be non-eligible are included in the
column "Adjustments"; the largest amounts concern the structural actions.

In the 2014-2020 programming period, the Common Provisions Regulation (CPR) applicable to the
Structural Funds (ERDF and ESF), Cohesion Fund and to the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund
(EMFF) foresees that the EU budget is protected by means of a systematic retention of 10 % of the
interim payments made. By February following the end of the CPR accounting year (1 July - 30 June), the
control cycle is complete both through management verifications by the managing authorities and audits
by the audit authorities. The Commission examines the assurance documents and the accounts provided
by the relevant authorities in the Member States. The payment / recovery of the final balance is made
only after this assessment is finalised and the accounts are accepted. The amount retained according to
this provision at end 2018 totalled EUR 5.7 billion. A part of this amount (EUR 0.9 billion) is estimated as
being non-eligible on the basis of the information provided by the Member States in their accounts and is
also included in the column "Adjustments". The final component of the adjustments to the payables is

                                  Annual accounts of the European Union 2018

represented by the amounts corresponding to other advances to Member States (see note 2.5.2) still to
pay at year-end (EUR 0.8 billion).

Payables concerning cohesion policy (ERDF, CF, ESF) have decreased which mainly relates to the fact
that claims related to the period 2007-2013 have significantly decreased to EUR 3.5 billion (2017:
EUR 10 billion), as the Commission is checking the final cost claims submitted by the Member States. At
the same time, claims related to period 2014-2020 increased to EUR 10 billion (2017: EUR 5 billion)
following further progress in the implementation of the programmes.

The increase in EAGF payables relates to the repartition of the total EAGF liabilities between payables and
accrued charges. The total EAGF liabilities remain relatively stable at EUR 44 159 million against
EUR 44 837 million last year. However, in 2018 the claimed amounts already covered by a conformity
decision (accounted for as payable) are higher than in 2017.

Requests for pre-financing

In addition to the above amounts, at the end of 2018, EUR 0.5 billion of requests for pre-financing have
been received and were not yet paid at year-end. According to the EU accounting rules, these amounts
are not booked as payables.

Own Resources Payables

Own resources payables refer to Member States EU budget contributions to be reimbursed at year-end
following the amending budget no 6/2018 adopted on 12 December 2018. Amending budgets are
implemented according to Article 10(3) of Regulation no 609/2014. According to this legal provision, the
resulting amounts were returned to the Member States on the first working day of January 2019. The
significant amount on 31 December 2017 was due to the adoption of amending budget no 6/2017 on
30 November 2017. This year the amending budget mainly gave rise to additional Member States
contributions (see note 2.6.1.1).



2.13. ACCRUED CHARGES AND DEFERRED INCOME

                                                                                              EUR million

The split of accrued charges is as follows:

                                                                                              EUR million

The biggest movement concerns agriculture (EAGF), for the explanation see note 2.12. For cohesion
policy, the increase for ERDF & CF is due to the increasing accruals for the current programming period
2014-2020 as the programmes further develop.

2.14.2. Guarantee Fund reserve

This reserve reflects the 9 % target amount of the outstanding amounts guaranteed by the EU budget
under the EIB external lending mandate, that is required to be kept as assets in the Guarantee Fund for
external actions (see note 2.4.1).


2.14.3. Other reserves

The amount relates primarily to the reserves of the ECSC in liquidation (EUR 1 514 million) for the assets
of the Research Fund for Coal and Steel, which were created in the context of the winding-up of the
ECSC.

Total amounts to be called from Member States at 31.12.2018                                    66 424

This amount represents that part of the expenses incurred by the EU up to 31 December that must be
funded by future budgets. Many expenses are recognised under accrual accounting rules in the year N
although they may be actually paid in year N+1 (or later) and therefore funded using the budget of year
N+1 (or later). The inclusion in the accounts of these liabilities coupled with the fact that the
corresponding amounts are financed from future budgets, results in liabilities greatly exceeding assets at
the year-end. The most significant amounts to be highlighted concern the EAGF activities and employee
benefit liabilities.

It should also be noted that the above has no effect on the budget result – budget revenue should always
equal or exceed budget expenditure and any excess of revenue is returned to Member States.

The remeasurements in employee benefits liabilities relate to actuarial gains and losses arising from the
actuarial valuation of these liabilities. As from 1 January 2018 the amended EU accounting rule 12 (based
on IPSAS 39) for employee benefits is applicable. According to this rule actuarial gains and losses are
presented as a movement in net assets rather than in the statement of financial performance.

3.       NOTES TO THE STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL
         PERFORMANCE
REVENUE

REVENUE FROM NON-EXCHANGE TRANSACTIONS: OWN
RESOURCES


3.1.     GNI RESOURCES

Own resources revenue is the primary element of the EU's operating revenue. GNI (gross national
income) revenue amounts to EUR 105 780 million for 2018 (2017: EUR 78 620 million) and is the most
significant of the three categories of own resources. A uniform percentage is levied on the GNI of each
Member State. The GNI revenue balances revenue and expenditure i.e. funds the part of the budget that
is not covered by other sources of income. The increase of GNI revenue is explained mainly by the rise of
payment appropriations in 2018 together with the limited budget surplus from the previous financial year
(EUR 556 million; excluding EFTA result). Both elements impacted the requested Member States' GNI
contributions in 2018, as this contribution is a balancing figure.



3.2.     TRADITIONAL OWN RESOURCES

                                                                                            EUR million
                                                                              2018              2017
Customs duties                                                                22 763           20 475
Sugar levies                                                                       4               45
Total                                                                        22 767           20 520

Traditional own resources comprise custom duties and sugar levies. Member States retain, by way of
collection costs, 20 % of traditional own resources, and the above amounts are shown net of this
deduction. The increase in customs duties largely refers to the infringement case accrued revenue (see
note 2.6.1.1).




3.3.     VAT RESOURCES

The VAT is defined as the Union’s second kind of own resources since this tax type was the first to be
largely harmonised at the EU level. The VAT contribution is calculated by applying a uniform call rate of
0.3 % to the national VAT base which cannot exceed 50 % of the gross national income (GNI) of each
Member State. For the period 2014-2020, the Council Decision 2014/335/EU, Euratom, foresees a
reduced rate of call of 0.15 % for Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden.

REVENUE FROM NON-EXCHANGE TRANSACTIONS:
TRANSFERS


3.4.      FINES

These revenues of EUR 6 740 million (2017: EUR 4 664 million) relate to fines the Commission has
imposed on companies for breaches of EU competition rules and to fines the Commission has imposed on
Member States for infringements of EU law. The Commission recognises revenues from fines when it
adopts the decision to impose a fine and it officially notifies the addressee. The amounts are mainly
competition fines (EUR 6 534 million). The biggest cases concern breaches of EU antitrust rules i.e. a fine
imposed on Google for imposing illegal restrictions on Android device manufacturers and mobile network
operators (EUR 4 343 million) and a fine imposed on Qualcomm for abusing its market dominance in
chipsets (EUR 997 million).



3.5.      RECOVERY OF EXPENSES

                                                                                              EUR million
                                                                              2018                2017

Indirect management                                                              34                  23

This heading mainly represents the recovery orders issued by the Commission that are cashed or offset
against (i.e. deducted from) subsequent payments recorded in the Commission's accounting system,
made so as to recover expenditure previously paid out from the EU budget. Recoveries are based on
controls, audits or eligibility analysis and therefore, these actions are an important consideration in
implementing the EU budget. These operations protect the EU budget from expenditure incurred in
breach of law.

Recovery orders issued by Member States to beneficiaries of EAGF expenditure, as well as the variation of
accrued income estimations from the previous year-end to the current, are also included.

The amounts included in the above table represent revenue earned through the issuance of recovery
orders. For this reason, these figures cannot and do not show the full extent of the measures taken to
protect the EU budget, particularly for cohesion policy where specific mechanisms are in place to ensure
the correction of ineligible expenditure, most of which do not involve the issuance of a recovery order.
Not included are amounts recovered through offsetting with expenses, amounts recovered by way of
withdrawals and recoveries of pre-financing amounts.

Shared management recoveries make up the bulk of the total:

Agriculture: EAGF and rural development

In the framework of the EAGF and the EAFRD, amounts accounted for as revenue of the year under this
heading are financial corrections of the year and reimbursements declared by Member States and
recovered during the year, as well as the net increase in the outstanding amounts declared by Member
States to be recovered at year-end concerning fraud and irregularities.

Cohesion policy

The main amounts related to cohesion policy relate to accrued income of EUR 1 146 million that the
Commission expects to recover from the Member States. The recovery will be made as a result of the
examination and acceptance of the annual accounts submitted by the Member States on
15 February 2019. This procedure for the acceptance of Member States' annual accounts has been
introduced for the first time in the cohesion area for the programming period 2014-2020.

Staff taxes and contributions revenue relates primarily to the deductions from staff salaries. Retirement
contributions and income tax represent the substantial amounts within the category.

Contributions from third countries are contributions from EFTA countries and accession countries.

Contributions from Member States for external aid are mainly the amounts received to set up the Facility
for Refugees in Turkey.

Transfer of assets revenue relates mainly to the transfer of satellites under the Copernicus programme
from the European Space Agency (ESA) to the Commission (see note 2.2). This transfer is a non-
exchange transaction according to the EU accounting rules and will occur in future periods for the
remaining Copernicus satellites currently under construction.

The budgetary adjustments resulted in a negative amount as they include a considerably lower budget

The biggest increase concerns cohesion policy (ERDF, CF and ESF) and mainly relates to expenses
declared during the year, which were paid or used to clear pre-financing. While there was a reduction of
expenses for the period 2007-2013 (closure phase), the implementation for the current programming
period 2014-2020 has significantly increased in 2018. The same applies for the EAFRD and other rural
development instruments.

Other expenses mainly include: Asylum and Migration (EUR 0.6 billion), Fund for European Aid to the
Most Deprived (EUR 0.4 billion), European Union Solidarity Fund (EUR 0.9 billion) and European Maritime
and Fisheries Fund (EUR 0.6 billion). The increase compared to last year mainly relates to the European
Union Solidarity Fund and the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund.

These amounts mainly concern the implementation of Research Policy (EUR 7.3 billion), Networks
Programmes (EUR 2.7 billion), Development Co-operation Instruments (EUR 1.4 billion), European
Neighbourhood Policy (EUR 1.1 billion).

The increase in direct management expenses implemented by EU Executive agencies mainly
(EUR 1.7 billion) refers to the Innovation and Networks Executive Agency (INEA) in particular the
transport part of the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF). The CEF for transport is the funding instrument to
implement European transport infrastructure policy and aims in building new or upgrading/rehabilitating
transport infrastructure in Europe.

Pension costs represent elements of the movements that have arisen following the actuarial valuation of
the employee benefits liabilities other than actuarial assumptions. They do not therefore represent actual
pension payments of the year, which are significantly lower.



3.13. CHANGES IN EMPLOYEE BENEFITS ACTUARIAL
      ASSUMPTIONS

As from 1 January 2018 the amended EU accounting rule 12 (based on IPSAS 39) for employee benefits
is applicable. According to this rule actuarial gains and losses (‘’remeasurements in employee benefits
liabilities’’) are presented as a movement in net assets rather than in the statement of financial
performance. The new accounting rule does not impact the estimation of these amounts.


3.14. FINANCE COSTS

4.        CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND ASSETS

4.1.       CONTINGENT LIABILITIES

Contingent liabilities are possible future payment obligations for the EU that may arise due to past events
or legally binding commitments taken but which will depend on future events not wholly under the
control of the EU. They relate mainly to financial guarantees given (on loans and financial assistance
programmes) and to legal risks. All contingent liabilities, except those relating to fines and guarantees
covered by funds (see note 2.4.1), would be financed, should they fall due, by the EU budget (and thus
the EU Member States) in the years to come.

The above table shows the extent of the exposure of the EU budget to possible future payments linked to
guarantees given to the EIB group. Disbursed amounts represent the amounts already given to final
beneficiaries, while signed amounts include these disbursed monies plus agreements already signed with
beneficiaries or financial intermediaries but not yet disbursed. The ceiling represents the total guarantee
that the EU budget, and thus its Member States, have committed to cover.

EIB external lending mandate guarantees

The EU budget guarantees loans signed and granted by the EIB from the EIB's own resources to third
countries. At 31 December 2018 the amount of loans outstanding and covered by the EU guarantee
totalled EUR 20 510 million (2017: 19 972 million). The EU budget guarantees:

     •   EUR 19 360 million (2017: EUR 18 583 million) via the Guarantee Fund for external actions (see
         note 2.4.1), and

     •   EUR 1 150 million (2017: EUR 1 389 million) directly for loans granted to Member States before
         accession.

In addition to the EUR 20 510 million disclosed above as disbursed, the EU guarantees a further
EUR 210 million of outstanding loans to Syria for which provisions have been made.

The EU external lending mandate guarantee relating to loans granted by the EIB is limited to 65 % of the
outstanding balances for agreements signed after 2007 (mandates 2007-2013 and 2014-2020). For
agreements before 2007 the EU guarantee is limited to a percentage of the ceiling of the credit lines
authorised, in most cases 65 % but also 70 %, 75 % or 100 %. Where the ceiling is not reached, the EU
guarantee covers the full amount.

To disclose the maximum exposure faced by the EU at 31 December 2018, however, one must also
include loans authorised to be signed but not yet signed (EUR 9 528 million) and loans signed but not
disbursed (EUR 10 379 million).

In March 2018 Decision (EU) 2018/412 was adopted by the European Parliament and the Council allowing
for an increase of the ceiling of the EIB financing operations under the EU guarantee. The guarantee
agreement with the EIB has been amended accordingly, which led to an increase of the EU maximum
exposure by EUR 3.4 billion in 2018.

European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI) guarantee

EFSI is an initiative that aims to increase the risk bearing capacity of the EIB Group by enabling the EIB
to extend its investments in the EU. The objective of EFSI is to support additional investments in the EU
and access to finance for small companies. EFSI is not a separate legal entity or an investment fund in
the strict sense. The EFSI risk reserve offers protection to the EIB against potential losses for underlying
operations. It is composed of a gradual allocation of at least EUR 7.5 billion of EIB's own capital and an
EU budget guarantee of up to EUR 26 billion ('EFSI EU guarantee'). The EFSI EU guarantee is provided to
the EIB under an agreement between the EU and the EIB, hereafter referred to as 'EFSI Agreement'. The
EFSI Agreement was amended in 2018, reflecting the increased EFSI EU guarantee ceiling of
EUR 26 billion in line with the amended EFSI Regulation (Regulation EU 2017/2396).

The EFSI operations are conducted within two windows: the Infrastructure and Innovation Window (IIW)
implemented by the EIB (EFSI EU guarantee of EUR 19.5 billion) and the SME Window (SMEW)
implemented by the EIF (EFSI EU guarantee of EUR 6.5 billion), both of which have a debt portfolio and
an equity portfolio. The EIF acts under an agreement with the EIB on the basis of an EIB guarantee which
itself is counter-guaranteed by the EFSI EU Guarantee under the EFSI Agreement.

The EU and the EIB have distinct roles within EFSI. EFSI is established within the EIB who finances the
operations (debt and equity investments) and, to do this, borrows the necessary funds on the capital
markets. Regarding the IIW, the EIB takes the investment decisions independently and manages the
operations in accordance with its rules and procedures. The same applies to the SMEW operations
managed by the EIF.

In order to ensure that investments made under EFSI remain focused on the specific objective of
addressing the market failures which hinder investment in the EU and that they are eligible for the
protection of the EU guarantee, a dedicated governance structure has been put in place. The Investment
Committee of independent experts examines each project proposed by the EIB under the IIW regarding
its eligibility for the EU guarantee coverage. Once an operation is confirmed to be eligible as EFSI
guaranteed operation, the decision to continue with the project and its management is then subject to
the normal EIB project cycle and governance process. Regarding SMEW, the role of the Investment
Committee is limited to the consultation on the description of the SMEW Products, which are being
approved by the EFSI Steering Board and EFSI Managing Director. EFSI is also supervised by a steering
board composed of five members, of which three are appointed by the Commission, one by the EIB and
one non-voting member by the European Parliament. The decisions shall be taken by consensus, and - if
the consensus cannot be achieved - by the unanimous vote among its voting members. The EFSI steering
board does not take investment decisions.

The role of the EU relates to the provision of the EU budget guarantee for part of the potential losses that
the EIB may suffer from its investments in debt and equity instruments. Consequently, the EU does not
intervene in the selection and management of EFSI operations, does not invest money in the EFSI
operations and is not a direct contractual party to the underlying instruments. As the control criteria and
accounting requirements for consolidation under the EU accounting rules (and IPSAS) are not met, the
related guaranteed assets are not accounted for in the consolidated annual accounts of the EU.

The EU guarantee granted to the EIB Group under EFSI is, in accordance with the EU accounting rules,
accounted for as a financial guarantee liability in respect of the IIW debt portfolio, as a financial provision
for the SMEW debt portfolio and as a derivative (financial asset or liability at fair value through surplus or
deficit) for both equity portfolios. In addition, a contingent liability related to the EFSI guarantee given is
disclosed in this note.

Under the EFSI IIW debt portfolio, the EU guarantee covers the first loss piece of a portfolio of financing
operations entered into by the EIB, which are mainly standard loans and guarantees. The EU guarantee is
called when the debtor fails to make a payment when due or in the case of a debt restructuring. The EU
guarantee is remunerated in proportion to the risk taken by the EU and this happens in the form of a
distribution, between the EIB and the EU, of the risk-related revenues received by EIB from the
guaranteed operations. The EU revenues should first cover the losses incurred on the guaranteed
operations. The EU guarantee is therefore accounted for as financial guarantee liability and measured, at
initial recognition, at fair value, being the net present value of the premiums receivable (the EU
revenues). At subsequent balance sheet dates, the financial guarantee liability is measured at the higher
of the expected losses and the amount initially recognised less, when appropriate, the accumulated
amortisation of the revenue. The financial guarantee liability is presented net of the EU revenues still to
be received – zero at 31 December 2018 (2017: nil) – see note 2.11.3.

Under the EFSI IIW equity portfolio, which consists of direct equity or quasi equity participations or
subordinated loans, the EIB invests pari-passu at its own risk and also at the risk of the EU.
Consequently, the EU guarantee covers - for the part of the equity investments guaranteed by the EU -
the negative value adjustments (unrealised losses) at each balance sheet date, the realised losses at dis-
investment and the EIB funding costs. In cases where the value of an investment, which was previously
subject to a negative value adjustment, increases at subsequent reporting dates, the amount up to the
original cost of the investment is reimbursed by the EIB to the EU. At the time of the dis-investment, the
EU is also entitled to gains on the investment exceeding the original cost. The EU guarantee is
remunerated by revenues received by the EIB from the guaranteed operations, including interests,
dividends and realised gains. The settlement between the EU and the EIB happens annually net of losses
and revenues.

Under EFSI SMEW equity portfolio, the EU guarantees equity investments in venture capital and private
equity funds, funded by the EIB and originated and managed by the EIF. The EU guarantee is provided
on a portfolio basis for two portfolios: sub-window 1 and sub-window 2. The EFSI guarantee is called to
cover impairment and realised losses from the guaranteed investments and the EIB funding costs. The
EU is entitled to the remuneration for the risk taken in form of dividends and realised gains from the
guaranteed equity operations. Under the sub-window 2, the EU Horizon 2020 programme also partially
invests in the same equity portfolio (the H2020 investment funded by the EU is accounted for as an
available for sale financial asset in the EU accounts) and bears first losses from the investments, while
further losses are covered by the EU Guarantee and the EIF.

The EFSI guarantee on the EFSI equity portfolio is classified as a derivative financial instrument and
accounted for as a financial asset or financial liability at fair value through surplus or deficit. At
31 December 2018 the fair value of the EFSI EU guarantee on the EFSI equity portfolio amounted to
EUR 14 million (2017: EUR 16 million) – see note 2.4.2.

The contingent liability above includes operations of the COSME, H2020, CCS and EaSI programmes for
the part covered by the EFSI EU guarantee under SMEW debt portfolio.

EU guarantee payments would be made by the EFSI Guarantee Fund – see note 2.4.1. At the end of
2018 the assets of the guarantee fund totalled EUR 5 452 million (2017: EUR 3 504 million), while
another EUR 2 688 million (2017: EUR 2 633 million) have been committed but not yet paid and is
included in the amount disclosed as RAL in note 5.1. During 2018 EUR 61 million of guarantee calls have
been paid out from the EFSI Guarantee Fund.

The EU budget guarantees the borrowings of the Commission taken to finance lending to Member and
non-Member States in the back-to-back transactions. These borrowings are already recognised as
liabilities on the EU balance sheet - see note 2.11.1. However, should there be a default on the back-to-
back-loans given out with these borrowings, the EU budget, based on Article 14 of Council Regulation
609/2014, would have to bear the full cost of the amount defaulted:

      •   Borrowings related to loans disbursed under the EFSM are guaranteed solely by the EU budget;

      •   Borrowings related to BOP loans are guaranteed solely by the EU budget;

      •   MFA loans are firstly guaranteed by the Guarantee Fund for external actions (see note 2.4.1) and
          then by the EU budget; and

      •   Guarantees from third parties are the first cover for the entire amounts of the outstanding
          Euratom loans. The Guarantee Fund would cover the external lending amounts should the third
          party guarantees not provide for them.

ECSC in Liquidation loans granted on borrowed funds are not covered by an EU budgetary guarantee.
Instead, they are covered by financial assets of the ECSC in Liquidation – see note 2.4.1.


4.1.3.     Guarantees given for EU financial instruments

                                                                                                 EUR million

As mentioned in Article 210(1) FR, the budgetary expenditure linked to a financial instrument and the
financial liability of the EU shall in no case exceed the amount of the relevant budgetary commitment
made for it, thus excluding contingent liabilities for the budget. In practise, it means that these liabilities
have a counter-part on the asset side of the balance sheet or are covered by the outstanding budgetary
commitments not yet expensed. The contingent liabilities above are shown net of financial provisions
made for these instruments – see note 2.10.


4.1.4.     Legal cases

Fines
These amounts mainly concern fines imposed by the Commission for infringement of competition rules
that have been provisionally paid by fined companies and where either an appeal has been lodged or
where it is unknown if an appeal will be made. The contingent liability will be maintained until a decision
by the Court of Justice on the case is final or until the expiry of the period for appeal. Interest earned on
provisional payments is included in the economic result of the year and also as a contingent liability to
reflect the uncertainty of the Commission’s title to these amounts.

Should the EU lose any of these cases relating to fines imposed, the amounts that have been
provisionally received will be returned to the companies. The amount of fines is only recognised as
budgetary revenue when the fines are definitive (Article 107 FR).

Agriculture
These are contingent liabilities towards the Member States connected with EAGF conformity decisions,
rural development and pre –accession financial corrections pending judgement of the Court of Justice.
The determination of the final amount of the liability and the year in which the effect of successful
appeals will be charged to the budget will depend on the length of the procedure before the Court.

Cohesion
These are contingent liabilities towards the Member States in connection with actions under cohesion
policy awaiting the oral hearing date or pending judgement of the Court of Justice.

Other legal cases
This heading relates to actions for damages currently being brought against the EU, other legal disputes
and the estimated legal costs. It should be noted that in an action for damages under Article 340 TFEU
the applicant must demonstrate a sufficiently serious breach by the institution of a rule of law intended to
confer rights on individuals, real harm suffered by the applicant, and a direct causal link between the
unlawful act and the harm. The amount for 2018 mainly concerns a damages claim against the European
Commission for a merger prohibition decision. The legal case is fairly new and at an early stage. As a
result, in the absence of a reliable estimate, the amount disclosed relates to the claimed amount.

5.       BUDGETARY AND LEGAL COMMITMENTS
This note provides information on the budgetary process and future funding needs and not on liabilities
existing as at 31 December 2018.

The multiannual financial framework (MFF) agreed by the Member States defines the programmes and
sets out the heading ceilings for commitment appropriations and the total for payment appropriations
within which the EU may enter into budgetary and legal commitments, and ultimately make payments for
a period of 7 years – see table 1.1 in the notes to the budgetary implementation reports.

The MFF ceilings were adopted by the Council (Member States), with the consent of the European
Parliament, and Article 16 of Regulation 1306/2013 on the financing of the CAP makes a direct link
between the annual ceiling of EAGF expenditure and the MFF Regulation. The European Parliament and
the Council also adopted the respective basic acts for the EAGF expenditure that set out the expenditure
per Member State for the entire period 2014-2020.

Legal commitments correspond to programmes, projects, agreements or contracts signed, thus legally
binding the EU. A legal commitment is the act whereby the authorising officer enters or establishes an
obligation (for the EU) which results in a charge (Article 2(37) FR).

A budgetary commitment is in principle made before the legal commitment, but for some multiannual
programmes/projects it is the reverse, the relevant budgetary commitments being made in annual
instalments, over several years, when the basic act so provides for. For example, for cohesion, Article 76
of the Common Provisions Regulation (CPR) (Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013) provides that the decision
of the Commission adopting a programme shall constitute a legal commitment within the meaning of the
Financial Regulation but that the budget commitments of the Union in respect of each programme shall
be made in annual instalments for each Fund during the period between 1 January 2014 and
31 December 2020. Other legal bases may contain similar provisions. For this reason, there may be
amounts that the EU has legally committed to pay, but where the budgetary commitment has not yet
been made – see notes 5.2 and 5.3 below.

If the budgetary commitment has been made but the subsequent payments are not yet made, the
amount of outstanding commitments is called "Reste à Liquider" (RAL). This can represent programmes
or projects, often multiannual, signed and for which payments will only be made in later years. They
represent payment obligations for future years. As the financial statements are prepared on an accrual
basis, whereas the budgetary implementation reports are prepared on a cash basis, part of the overall
amounts unpaid (RAL) has already been expensed and is recognised as a liability on the balance sheet
(see notes 2.12 and 2.13). The calculation of these expenses is made based either on cost
claims/invoices received or on the estimated implementation of a programme or project where no claims
have been notified yet to the EU – see note 5.1 below. Once the payments relating to the RAL are made
after 31 December 2018, the liability on the balance sheet is derecognised. The part of the RAL not
expensed yet is not included under liabilities but is instead disclosed below.

The disclosures below thus represent amounts at 31 December 2018 that the EU has committed to pay
based on the fulfilment of the contractual agreements and which are therefore intended to be funded by
future EU budgets.

                                                                                             EUR million

         EXPENSED

                                                                                               EUR million

Outstanding budgetary commitments not yet expensed                             235 836           221 391

The amount disclosed above is the budgetary RAL ("Reste à Liquider") of EUR 281 175 million (see
table 4.4 in the notes to the budgetary implementation reports), less related amounts that have been
included as liabilities on the balance sheet and as expenses in the statement of financial performance.
The budgetary RAL is an amount representing the open commitments for which payments and/or de-
commitments have not yet been made. As explained above, this is the normal consequence of the
existence of multiannual programmes.

It should be noted that outstanding pre-financing advances at 31 December 2018 totalled EUR 50 billion
(see note 2.5). This represents budgetary commitments that have been paid, decreasing the RAL, but
where the amounts paid are still considered as belonging to the EU and not to the beneficiary until the
contractual commitments are fulfilled. They are thus like the RAL disclosed above, not yet expensed.

These are legal obligations that the EU has committed to paying when adopting the operational
programmes related to shared management. The decision of the Commission adopting an operational
programme shall constitute a financing decision within the meaning of Article 110 FR and once notified to
the Member State concerned, a legal commitment within the meaning of that Regulation.

Article 76 of the CPR for European Structural and Investment Funds (ESIF) states:

"The budget commitments of the Union in respect of each programme shall be made in annual
instalments for each Fund during the period between 1 January 2014 and 31 December 2020. The budget
commitments relating to the performance reserve in each programme shall be made separately from the
remaining allocation to the programme."

5.3.     SIGNIFICANT LEGAL COMMITMENTS IN OTHER AREAS

                                                                                            EUR million

These amounts reflect the long-term legal commitments that were not yet covered by commitment
appropriations in the budget at year-end. These binding obligations will be budgeted in annual
instalments in future years and paid.

Certain important programmes (see below) may be implemented by annual instalments according to
Article 112(2) FR. This allows the EU to make legal commitments (sign grant agreements, delegation
agreements and procurement contracts) in excess of the available commitment appropriations of a given
year. Therefore a substantial amount of the overall allocation for the current MFF may be already
committed. This applies in particular for the programmes described below:

Connecting Europe Facility (CEF)

The CEF provides financial assistance to trans-European networks in order to support projects of common
interest in the sectors of transport, telecommunications and energy infrastructures. The legal
commitments for the CEF programme cover an implementation period running from 2014 until 2023 for
the CEF Transport and up to 31.12.2024 for CEF Energy. The legal basis of these commitments is
Regulation (EU) No 1316/2013 of the EP and of the Council of 11 December 2013 establishing the
Connecting Europe Facility, amending Regulation (EU) No 913/2010 and repealing Regulations (EC)
No 680/2007 and (EC) No 67/2010 Text with EEA relevance (OJ L 348, 20 December 2013) which
foresees the use of the annual instalment in its article 19.

Copernicus

Copernicus is the European Earth observation programme – see also note 2.2. These commitments are
made for the period until 2020. Based on Regulation (EU) 377/2014 of the EP and Council of 3 April 2014
(OJ L 122/44 of 24 April 2014) the Commission signed delegation agreements with the European Space
Agency (ESA), EUMETSAT, Mercator and the European Centre for Medium Range weather forecasts.
Article 8 of Regulation 377/2014 authorises the use of annual instalments.

ITER – International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor

These commitments are intended to cover future funding needs of the ITER facilities up to 2021. The EU
(Euratom) contribution to ITER International is given through the Fusion for Energy Agency, including
also the contributions from Member States and from Switzerland. These commitments are made on the
basis of Council decision (Euratom) 791/2013 of 13 December 2013 amending decision (Euratom)
198/2007 establishing the European Joint Undertaking for ITER and the Development of Fusion Energy
which authorises the use of annual instalments. ITER was created to manage and to encourage the
exploitation of the ITER facilities, to promote public understanding and acceptance of fusion energy, and
to undertake any other activities that are necessary to achieve its purpose. ITER involves the EU, China,
India, Russia, South Korea, Japan and the USA.

Galileo

These are amounts committed to the Galileo programme developing a European Global Navigation
Satellite System – see also note 2.2. These commitments are made for the period until 2020. Based on
Regulation (EU) 1285/2013 of the EP and Council of 11 December 2013 (OJ L 347/1 of
20 December 2013) the Commission signed a delegation agreement with ESA. Article 9 of Regulation
(EU) 1285/2013 authorises the use of annual instalments.

Fisheries agreements

These represent commitments entered into with third countries for operations under international
fisheries agreements up to 2023. The commitments made are based on Council decisions for each third
country (e.g. Council Decision (EU) 2019/385 of 4 March 2019 on the conclusion of the Protocol on the
implementation of the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Union and the Republic of
Côte d'Ivoire (2018-2024); OJ L 70, 12 March 2019) and are considered specific international treaties
with multiannual rights and obligations.

Operating lease commitments

Minimum amounts committed to be paid according to the underlying contracts during the remaining term
of these lease contracts are as follows:

                                                                                            EUR million

In the context of the United Kingdom’s notification of its intention to withdraw from the European Union,
and as a result of Regulation (EU) 2018/1718 of the European Parliament and of the Council of
14 November 2018 amending Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, the seat of the European Medicines Agency
(‘EMA’) was relocated from London to Amsterdam. The current lease contract for the premises in London
has a term expiring in 2039 and will thus need to be terminated early or subject to a reassignment or a
subletting agreement with a third party.

The amounts disclosed in the table above include EUR 468 million still due under this lease contract,
however the future net financial impact in the consolidated financial statements, if any, depends on
termination negotiations with the landlord or on the contractual terms of subletting agreement entered
into with a third party.

Other contractual commitments

The amounts included under this disclosure correspond to amounts committed to be paid during the term
of the contracts. The most significant amount included here relates to building contracts of the European
Parliament (EUR 87 million).

6.         FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT
The following disclosures with regard to the financial risk management of the EU relate to:

     •   Borrowing and lending activities for financial assistance carried out by the Commission through:
         EFSM, BOP, MFA, and Euratom actions and for loans from borrowed funds of the ECSC in
         Liquidation;

     •   The treasury operations carried out by the Commission in order to implement the EU budget,
         including the receipt of fines;

     •   Assets held in funds for budgetary guarantees: the Guarantee Fund for external actions, the EFSI
         Guarantee Fund and the EFSD Guarantee Fund; and

     •   Financial instruments financed by the EU budget.


6.1.       TYPES OF RISK

Market risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate,
because of variations in market prices. Market risk embodies not only the potential for loss, but also the
potential for gain. It comprises currency risk, interest rate risk and other price risk (the EU has no
significant other price risk).

     •   Currency risk is the risk that the EU's operations or its investments' value will be affected by
         changes in exchange rates. This risk arises from the change in price of one currency against
         another.

     •   Interest rate risk is the possibility of a reduction in the value of a security, especially a bond,
         resulting from an increase in interest rates. In general, higher interest rates will lead to lower
         prices of fixed rate bonds, and vice versa.

Credit risk is the risk of loss due to a debtor's / borrower's non-payment of a loan or other line of credit
(either the principal or interest or both) or other failure to meet a contractual obligation. The default
events include a delay in repayments, restructuring of borrower repayments and bankruptcy.

Liquidity risk is the risk that arises from the difficulty in selling an asset; for example, the risk that a
given security or asset cannot be traded quickly enough in the market to prevent a loss or meet an
obligation.


6.2.       RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES

The implementation of the EU budget relies increasingly on the use of operational programme financial
instruments. For more information on the amounts concerned, see note 2.4.1.

Common to most financial instruments is the fact that the implementation is delegated to either the EIB
group (including EIF) or to other financial institutions based on an agreement between the Commission
and the financial institution. Agreements signed with these financial institutions include strict conditions
and obligations on the intermediaries so as to ensure that EU monies are properly managed and reported
on. Once a financial contribution to one of the instruments has been committed, the funds are transferred
to a specifically created bank account of the financial institution (i.e. a fiduciary account). The financial
institution may, depending on the instrument in question, use the funds on this fiduciary account to
provide loans, issue debt instruments, invest in equity instruments or cover the guarantee calls. Proceeds
from financial instruments have, as a general rule, to be reimbursed to the EU budget.

The risk as regards these financial instruments is limited to a ceiling as indicated in the underlying
agreements, which is the budgeted amount foreseen for the instrument. As the Commission often bears
the "first loss piece" and since instruments are intended to finance riskier beneficiaries (who have
difficulties in obtaining funding from commercial lenders), it is therefore likely that some losses to the EU
budget will occur.

Measurement of financial instruments

The following classes of financial assets and liabilities are not measured at fair value: cash and cash
equivalents, loans, exchange receivables and non-exchange recoverables, borrowings and other financial
liabilities measured at amortised cost. The carrying amount of those financial assets and liabilities is
considered as a reasonable approximation of their fair value.

Borrowing and lending activities for financial assistance

The borrowing and lending transactions, as well as related treasury management, are carried out by the
EU according to the respective Council and EP Regulation, Council Decisions, and, if applicable, internal
guidelines. Written procedure manuals covering specific areas such as borrowings, loans and treasury
management have been developed and are used by the relevant operational units. Lending operations
are financed by "back-to-back" borrowings, which thus do not generate open interest rate or currency
positions.

Treasury

The rules and principles for the management of the Commission's treasury operations are laid down in
the Council Regulation 609/2014 (as amended by Council Regulation 804/2016) and in the Financial
Regulation.

As a result of the above regulations, the following main principles apply:

    •   Own resources are paid by the Member States into accounts opened for this purpose in the name
        of the Commission with the Treasury or national central bank. The Commission may draw on the
        above accounts solely to cover its cash requirements.

    •   Own resources are paid by Member States in their own national currencies, while the
        Commission's payments are mostly denominated in EUR.

    •   Bank accounts opened in the name of the Commission may not be overdrawn. This restriction
        does not apply to the Commission's own resource accounts in case of a default on loans
        contracted or guaranteed pursuant to EU Council regulations and decisions and under certain
        conditions in case the cash resource requirements are in excess of the assets of the accounts.

    •   Funds held in bank accounts denominated in currencies other than EUR are either used for
        payments in the same currencies or periodically converted in EUR.

In addition to the own resources accounts, other bank accounts are opened by the Commission, with
central banks and commercial banks, for the purpose of executing payments and receiving receipts other
than the Member State contributions to the budget.

Treasury and payment operations are highly automated and rely on modern information systems.
Specific procedures are applied to guarantee system security and to ensure segregation of duties in line
with the Financial Regulation, the Commission’s internal control standards, and audit principles.

A written set of guidelines and procedures regulates the management of the Commission's treasury and
payment operations with the objective of limiting operational and financial risk and ensuring an adequate
level of control. They cover different areas of operation (for example: payment execution and cash
management, cashflow forecasting, business continuity, etc.), and compliance with the guidelines and
procedures is checked regularly. Additionally, information is exchanged between the Directorate General
for the Budget and the Directorate-General for Economic and Financial Affairs on risk management and
best practices.

Fines

Provisionally cashed fines: deposits

Amounts received before 2010 remain in bank accounts with banks specifically selected for the deposit of
provisionally cashed fines. The selection of banks is conducted in compliance with tender procedures
defined by the Financial Regulation. Placement of funds with specific banks is determined by the internal
risk management policy defining the credit rating requirements and the amount of funds which could be
placed in proportion to the counterparty equity. Financial and operational risks are identified and
evaluated and compliance with internal policies and procedures is checked regularly.

Provisionally cashed fines: BUFI portfolio

Fines imposed and provisionally cashed from 2010 onwards are invested in a specifically created
portfolio, BUFI. The main objectives of the portfolio are the reduction of risks associated with financial
markets and the equal treatment of all fined entities by offering a guaranteed return calculated on the
same basis. The asset management for provisionally cashed fines is carried out by the Commission in
accordance with internal asset management guidelines. Procedural manuals covering specific areas such
as treasury management have been developed and are used by the relevant operational units. Financial
and operational risks are identified and evaluated and compliance with internal guidelines and procedures
is checked regularly.

The objectives of the asset management activities are to invest the fines provisionally paid to the
Commission in such a way as to:

    •   ensure that the funds are easily available when needed, while

    •   aiming at delivering, under normal circumstances, a return which on average is in line with the
        return of the BUFI Benchmark minus costs incurred, while preserving the nominal amount for the
        fines which were paid into the portfolio before the entry into force of the new Financial Regulation
        in August 2018.

Investments are restricted essentially to the following categories: term deposits with Member States'
Central Banks, sovereign debt agencies, fully state-owned or state-guaranteed banks or supranational
institutions, and bonds, bills and Certificates of Deposit issued by either sovereign or supranational
institutions.

Bank guarantees

Significant amounts of guarantees issued by financial institutions are held by the Commission in relation
to the fines it imposes on companies breaching EU competition rules (see note 2.6.1.2). These
guarantees are provided by fined companies as an alternative to making provisional payments. The
guarantees are managed in compliance with the internal risk management policy. Financial and
operational risks are identified and evaluated and compliance with internal policies and procedures is
checked regularly.

Guarantee Fund for external actions

The rules and principles for the asset management of the Guarantee Fund are laid out in the Convention
between the Commission and the EIB dated 25 November 1994 and the subsequent amendments dated
17/23 September 1996, 8 May 2002, 25 February 2008, 9 November 2010 and 28 October 2018. This
Guarantee Fund operates only in euros. It exclusively invests in this currency in order to avoid any
foreign currency risk. Management of the assets is based upon the traditional rules of prudence adhered
to for financial activities. It is required to pay particular attention to reducing the risks and to ensuring
that the managed assets can be sold or transferred without significant delay, taking into account the
commitments covered.

EFSI Guarantee Fund

The EFSI Guarantee Fund was established by EFSI Regulation – see note 2.4.1. The rules and principles
for the asset management of the Fund are laid out in the Commission Decision C(2016)165 of
21 January 2016. The managed assets shall provide sufficient liquidity in relation to the potential
guarantee calls, while still aiming at optimising the return and risk level that is compatible with
maintaining a high degree of security and stability.

EFSD Guarantee Fund

EFSD Guarantee Fund has been established pursuant to the EFSD Regulation – see note 2.4.1. The
management of the EFSD Guarantee Fund assets is carried out by the Commission in accordance with
internal guidelines and asset management guidelines which are included as Annex 1 to Commission
Decision C(2017)7693 of 22 November 2017. The assets are managed in such a way so as to provide
sufficient liquidity in relation to the potential guarantee calls, while still aiming at optimising the return
and risk level that is compatible with maintaining a high degree of security and stability.

Borrowing and lending activities for financial assistance

Financial assets and liabilities are mostly in EUR, so the EU has no foreign currency risk.

Treasury

Own resources paid by Member States in currencies other than EUR are kept on the own resources
accounts, in accordance with Council Regulation 609/2014 (as amended by Council regulation 804/2016).
They are converted into EUR when they are needed to cover for the execution of payments. The
procedures applied for the management of these funds are laid down by the above referred regulation. In
a limited number of cases, these funds are directly used for payments to be executed in the same
currencies.

A number of accounts in EU currencies other than EUR, and in USD and CHF, are held by the Commission
with commercial banks, for the purpose of executing payments denominated in these same currencies.
These accounts are replenished depending on the amount of payments to be executed, as a consequence
their balances do not represent exposure to currency risk.

When miscellaneous receipts (receipts other than own resources) are received in currencies other than
EUR, they are either transferred to Commission's accounts held in the same currencies, if they are
needed to cover the execution of payments, or converted into EUR and transferred to accounts held in
EUR. Imprest accounts held in currencies other than EUR are replenished depending on the estimated
short-term local payments needs in the same currencies. Balances on these accounts are kept within
their respective ceilings.

Fines

Provisionally cashed fines (deposits and BUFI portfolio) and bank guarantees

Since all fines are imposed and paid in EUR, there is no foreign currency risk.

Guarantee Fund for external actions

The financial assets of this fund are in EUR so there is no currency risk. The loans subrogated to the EU
as result of calls on the Fund following payment defaults by a loan beneficiary are carried out in their
original currency and therefore expose the EU to currency risk. There are no activities to compensate
foreign currency variations ("hedging" activities) due to uncertainty relating to the loans repayment
timing.

EFSI Guarantee Fund

The EFSI Guarantee Fund currently operates in both EUR and USD. Currency risk is managed through
entering into derivative contracts (foreign exchange forward contracts) hedging the market value of the
USD investments portfolio. The limit for maximum unhedged foreign exchange exposure is set at 1 % of
the total portfolio value within the benchmark and annual strategy allocations. Thus, upward or
downward movements in the USD investments' market value above or below the 1 % limit would trigger
a rebalancing trade (a new forward contract with the same or opposite direction), adjusting or reversing

the hedged position accordingly. Readjustment of the hedge may also be prompted by movements of the
EUR/USD exchange rate.

The loans subrogated to the EU as result of calls on the Fund following payment defaults by a loan
beneficiary are carried out in their original currency and therefore expose the EU to currency risk. For the
subrogated loans, there are no activities to compensate foreign currency variations ("hedging" activities)
due to uncertainty relating to the loans repayment timing.

EFSD Guarantee Fund

The EFSD Guarantee Fund currently operates in EUR only, but the asset management guidelines for the
EFSD Guarantee Fund provide for the possibility to invest in certain non-EUR denominated assets.

Borrowing and lending activities for financial assistance

Due to the nature of its borrowing and lending activities, the EU has significant interest-bearing assets
and liabilities. However, there is no interest rate risk since the borrowings are offset by equivalent loans
at the same terms and conditions (back-to-back).

Treasury

The Commission's treasury does not borrow money; so as a consequence, it is not exposed to interest
rate risk. Interest is however calculated on balances held on the different bank accounts. The
Commission has therefore put in place measures to ensure that interest earned on its bank accounts
regularly reflects market interest rates, as well as their possible fluctuation.

Accounts opened with Member States Treasuries for own resources receipts are non-interest bearing and
free of charges. Accounts held with national central banks may be remunerated at the official rates
applied by each institution. As some of the remunerations applied to these accounts may currently be
negative, cash management procedures are in place to minimise balances kept on these accounts.

In addition, own resources accounts are protected from any impact of negative interest in accordance
with Council Regulation 609/2014 and as amended by Council Regulation 804/2016.

Overnight balances held on commercial bank accounts earn interest on a daily basis. This is based on
variable market rates to which a contractual margin (positive or negative) is applied. The rates applied by
commercial banks are in general contractually floored at zero. As a result no risk exists that the
Commission earns interest at rates lower than market rates.

Fines

Provisionally cashed fines (deposits, BUFI portfolio) and bank guarantees

The provisionally cashed fines are invested in a portfolio of money market instruments and long-term
bonds with an average duration of 2.58 years.

Receivables and recoverables less than 1 year include recoverables related to competition fines
amounting to EUR 6 366 million, while receivables and recoverables between 1 and 5 years contain
recoverables concerning competition fines of EUR 3 136 million. The previously mentioned amounts are
largely covered by bank guarantees, thus making the Commission’s exposure to the credit risk low. Fined
companies provide these guarantees as an alternative to making provisional payments.

* Available for sale financial assets (excluding equity instruments and Unitary Fund).
** Financial assets at fair value through surplus or deficit.


Not included in the above table are available for sale financial assets in the form of equity instruments
without external credit rating. The four risk categories mentioned above are in principle based on the
rating categories of external rating agencies and correspond to:

     •    Prime and high grade: Moody P-1, Aaa – Aa3; S&P A-1+, A-1, AAA – AA -; Fitch F1+, F1, AAA –
          AA- and equivalent

     •    Upper medium grade: Moody P-2, A1 – A3; S&P A-2, A+ - A-; Fitch F2, A+ - A- and equivalent

     •    Lower medium grade: Moody P-3, Baa1 – Baa3, S&P A-3, BBB+ - BBB-; Fitch F-3, BBBB+ - BBB-
          and equivalent

     •    Non-investment grade: Moody not prime, Ba1 – C; S&P B, C, BB+ - D; Fitch B, C, BB+ - D and
          equivalent

The EU uses these external agencies rating categories as a reference point notably for financial
instruments and commercial banks, but may, after making its own analysis of individual cases, keep
amounts in one of the above risk categories even though one or more of the above mentioned rating
agencies may have downgraded the corresponding counterparty. As regards non-rated counterparties,
group 1 relates to debtors without defaults in the past and group 2 relates to debtors with defaults in the
past.


                                                                 87
-----------------------Page 89 End-----------------------

                                  Annual accounts of the European Union 2018

The amounts displayed above under loans and receivables categorised in non-investment grade relate
primarily to financial support loans disbursed by the Commission to Member States in financial difficulties
and recoverables against certain Members States based on own resources regulations or other legal
basis. The amount under cash relates to own resources bank accounts opened in the Treasury or in the
central banks of Member States to hold the own resources contributions as foreseen in the above referred
regulation. The Commission may draw on these accounts solely to cover cash requirements arising from
execution of the budget.

Borrowing and lending activities for financial assistance

Exposure to credit risk is managed firstly by obtaining State guarantees in the case of Euratom, then
through the Guarantee Fund for external actions (MFA & Euratom), then by the possibility of drawing the
necessary funds from the Commission's own resources accounts with the Member States and ultimately
through the Budget of the EU.

The Own Resources legislation fixes the ceiling for own resources payments at 1.20 % of Member States'
GNI and during 2018 0.90 % was actually used to cover payment appropriations. This means that at
31 December 2018 there existed an available margin of 0.30 % to cover these guarantees. To this end,
the EU is entitled to call upon all the Member States to ensure compliance with the EU's legal obligation
towards its lenders.

Treasury

Most of the Commission's treasury resources are kept, in accordance with Council Regulation 609/2014
(as amended by Council Regulation 804/2016) on own resources, in the accounts opened by Member
States for the payment of their contributions (own resources). All such accounts are held with Member
States' treasuries or national central banks. These institutions carry the lowest credit (or counterparty)
risk for the Commission as the exposure is with its Member States. For the part of the Commission's
treasury resources kept with commercial banks, in order to cover the execution of payments,
replenishment of these accounts is made on a just-in-time basis and is automatically managed by the
treasury cash management system. Minimum cash levels, which take into account the average amount of
daily payments executed from it, are kept on each account. As a consequence the total amount kept
overnight on these accounts remains constantly at low levels (overall less than EUR 80 million on
average, spread over around 20 accounts) and so it is ensured that the Commission's risk exposure is
limited. These amounts should be viewed with regard to the daily overall treasury balances which
fluctuated in 2018 between EUR 6 billion and EUR 37 billion, and with an overall amount of payments
made from Commission accounts in 2018 that exceeded EUR 155 billion.

In addition, specific guidelines are applied for the selection of commercial banks in order to further
minimise counterparty risk to which the Commission is exposed:

    •   All commercial banks are selected by call for tenders. The minimum short-term credit rating
        required for admission to the tendering procedures is Moody's P-1 or equivalent. A lower level
        may be accepted in specific and duly justified circumstances.

    •   The credit ratings of the commercial banks where the Commission has accounts are monitored on
        a daily basis.

    •   In delegations outside the EU, imprest accounts are held with local banks selected by a simplified
        tendering procedure. Rating requirements depend on the local situation and may significantly
        differ from one country to another. In order to limit risk exposure, balances on these accounts
        are kept at the lowest possible levels (taking into account operational needs), they are regularly
        replenished, and the applied ceilings are reviewed on a yearly basis.

Fines

Provisionally cashed fines: deposits

Banks holding deposits for the fines provisionally cashed before 2010 are selected by tender procedure in
compliance with the risk management policy which defines the credit rating requirements and the amount
of funds which could be placed in proportion to the counterparty equity.

For commercial banks that have been specifically selected for the deposit of provisionally cashed fines, a
minimum long-term rating A- (S&P or equivalent) with two rating agencies is required as a general rule.
Specific measures are applied in case banks in this group are subject to downgrade. In addition, the
amount deposited with each bank is limited to a certain percentage of its own funds, which varies
depending on the rating level of each institution. The calculation of such limits also takes into account the
amount of outstanding guarantees issued to the Commission by the same institution. The compliance of
outstanding deposits with the applicable policy requirements is reviewed regularly.

Provisionally cashed fines: BUFI portfolio

For sovereign debt investments from provisionally cashed fines imposed as from 2010, the Commission
takes on the exposure to credit risk. The highest concentration of exposure is towards Spain, which
represents 16 % of the portfolio. The five countries with the highest exposure (Spain, France,
Luxembourg, Germany and Italy) represent altogether 67 % of the investment portfolio. The weighted
average credit rating of the portfolio is A- (S&P or equivalent).

Bank guarantees

The risk management policy applied for the acceptance of such guarantees ensures a high credit quality
for the Commission. The compliance of the outstanding guarantees with the applicable policy
requirements is reviewed regularly.

Guarantee Fund for external actions

The treasury portfolio’s agreed asset management guidelines and/or investment strategy define certain
limits and restrictions in order to limit the exposure to credit risk of the portfolio. Such limits and
restrictions include eligibility criteria, absolute credit limits in nominal terms depending on issuer
category, relative concentration limits depending on issuer category and concentration limits per issue.
All investments are rated at least as investment grade.

EFSI Guarantee Fund

The asset management guidelines, risk and investment strategies define certain limits and restrictions in
order to limit the exposure to credit risk of the portfolio which is generally limited to investment grade.
The weighted average credit rating of the portfolio is A- (S&P or equivalent).

As the sole counterparty for all outstanding currency forwards as of 31 December 2018 is the Banque de
France, no credit enhancements, such as collateral, netting agreements, or guarantees are put in place
as of this date. The maximum exposure to credit risk for foreign exchange derivatives having a positive
fair value at the end of the reporting period is equal to the carrying amount on the balance sheet.

EFSD Guarantee Fund

The asset management guidelines, risk and investment strategies define certain limits and restrictions in
order to limit the exposure to credit risk of the portfolio, which is generally limited to investment grade.
The weighted average credit rating of the portfolio is AAA (S&P or equivalent) by application of the
sovereign rating for the cash held at central bank.

Borrowing and lending activities for financial assistance

The liquidity risk that arises from borrowings is generally offset by equivalent loans in terms and
conditions (back-to-back operations). For MFA and Euratom, the Guarantee Fund for external actions
serves as a liquidity reserve (or safety net) in case of payment default and payment delays of borrowers.
For BOP, the Council Regulation 431/2009 provides for a procedure allowing sufficient time to mobilise
funds through the Commission's own resources accounts with the Member States. For EFSM, the Council
Regulation 407/2010 provides for a similar procedure.

Treasury

EU budget principles ensure that overall cash resources for a given year are always sufficient for the
execution of all payments. In fact, the total Member States contributions together with the miscellaneous
receipts equal the amount of payment appropriations for the budgetary year. Member States’
contributions, however, are received in twelve monthly instalments throughout the year, while payments
are subject to certain seasonality. Moreover, in accordance with the Council Regulation 609/2014 (on the
methods and procedure for making available own resources, amended by Council Regulation 804/2016),
Member States contributions relating to amending budgets approved in a given month (N) only become
available either on the first working day of the month N+1 (if approved before the 16th of the given
month) or on the first working day of month N+2 (if approved on the 16th or later of that given month),
while the related payment appropriations are immediately available.

In order to ensure that available treasury resources are always sufficient to cover the payments to be
executed in any given month, procedures regarding regular cash forecasting are in place, and own
resources or additional funding can be called up in advance from Member States if needed, up to certain
limits and under certain conditions. Seasonality of expenditure and overall budgetary restrictions in
recent years have resulted in the need for increased monitoring of the rhythm of payments over the year.
In addition to the above, in the context of the Commission's daily treasury operations, automated cash
management tools ensure that sufficient liquidity is available on each of the Commission's bank accounts,
on a daily basis.

Fines

Provisionally cashed fines: BUFI portfolio

The fund is managed according to the principle that the assets shall have a sufficient degree of liquidity
and mobilisation in relation to the relevant commitments. The portfolio is composed of mostly highly
liquid securities that can be sold to meet unexpected cash outflows. In addition, the share of cash, cash
equivalents and securities maturing within 1 year is 23 %.

Guarantee Fund for external actions

The Fund is managed according to the principle that the assets shall have a sufficient degree of liquidity
and mobilisation in relation to the relevant commitments. The fund therefore maintains a sufficient
amount of monetary assets to cover short-term outflows. The share of cash, cash equivalents and
securities maturing within 1 year is 9.2 %.

EFSI Guarantee Fund

The EFSI Guarantee Fund is managed according to the principle that the assets shall have a sufficient
degree of liquidity and mobilisation in relation to the relevant commitments. The portfolio is composed of
liquid assets that can be sold to meet unexpected cash outflows. In addition the share of cash, cash
equivalents and securities maturing within 1 year is 22 %.

The settlement of derivative contracts is gross and is based on their contractual maturity. Obligations are
honoured via sales of USD-denominated assets and/or a swap transaction, whereby it is possible that
a cash outflow arises due to foreign exchange differences.

No liquidity management is necessary with regard to collateral / margin requirements as the current
hedging counterparty accepts to operate with the Commission without any requirements for collateral /
margin calls.

EFSD Guarantee Fund

The EFSD Guarantee Fund is managed according to the principle that the assets shall have a sufficient
degree of liquidity and mobilisation in relation to the relevant commitments.

The portfolio is composed of 97 % cash held in current accounts.

Other financial instruments – derivative financial liabilities

In 2017 the EU entered into a derivative contract (foreign exchange option) covering the devaluation of
foreign exchange currency related to loans given by financial institutions (see note 2.11.2). Moreover,
the EU guarantee on equity portfolios held by the EIB Group lead to a financial obligation to cover
changes in the value or impairments of underlying investments. As for the other financial instruments
financed by the EU Budget, the amount for which the EU is liable under these instruments cannot exceed
the amount committed, being the liquidity risk mitigated by that fact.

                                Annual accounts of the European Union 2018

The objective of this Financial Statement Discussion and Analysis (FSDA) is to assist readers to
understand the financial position, financial performance and cash flows presented in the consolidated
financial statements of the EU. The information presented in this FSDA has not been audited.


1. CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE
   EU: FINANCIAL SITUATION 2018

1.1.     REVENUE

The consolidated revenue of the EU incorporates amounts related to exchange transactions and non-
exchange transactions, the latter being the most significant.

The table below provides an overview of the main categories of non-exchange transactions.

Five-year trend of revenue from main non-exchange transactions (in EUR million)




As budget revenue should equal (or exceed) budget expenditure, the main driver in the revenue trend
shown above is the payments made each year. In 2018 the consolidated revenue increase of 20 %, to
EUR 163 billion, when compared to the previous year, was mainly due to the following:

   •   an increase of EUR 27 billion in the GNI resources, or 35 % compared to the previous year. This
       effect primarily reflects the impact of the growth of payment appropriations in the 2018 budget.
       The sharp increase primarily relates to the low GNI resources of 2017 and the effect of the
       budget surplus from 2016, EUR 6.4 billion, recognised in 'other revenue from non-exchange
       transactions’. In 2018, the budget surplus from 2017, recognised in the statement of financial
       performance at 31 December 2018, was much lower, EUR 0.6 billion, which explains, on the one
       hand the increase need for GNI resources since GNI resource is used to finance the part of the
       budget not covered by any other source of revenue and, on the other hand the decrease in ‘other
       revenue’;

   •   an increase in the Traditional Own Resources of EUR 2.2 billion related to an infringement of EU
       legislation by the United Kingdom during the period November 2011 to October 2017. As a
       consequence of this infringement, late payment interest of EUR 1.3 billion was also charged,
       explaining the increase of the financial revenue; and

   •   an increase compared to 2017 of EUR 2 billion in competition fines issued by the EU, as a result
       of law infringements by private entities.

1.2.     EXPENSES

The main component of expenses recognised in the consolidated financial statements is transfer
payments under the shared management mode, which includes the following funds: (i) European
Agricultural Guarantee Fund (EAGF); (ii) European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) and
other rural development instruments; (iii) European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) & Cohesion Fund
(CF); and (iv) European Social Fund (ESF). These funds made up almost 66 % of total expenses in 2018
- the split can be found in the chart below.

Relative weight of the main expenses implemented by the Member States (shared management) for the
financial year of 2018




Expenses incurred under direct management represent the budget implementation by the Commission,
executive agencies and by trust funds. Under indirect management the budget is implemented by EU
agencies, EU bodies, third countries, international organisations and other entities.

Expenses incurred under direct and indirect management made up approx. 19 % of total expenses
(EUR 28.5 billion) and remained stable compared to the previous financial year.

The EU recognises certain future payment obligations as expenses even if they are not yet shown in the
cash-based budgetary accounts. Significant amounts are shown under payables and accrued charges
concerning agriculture and rural development and also under pension and employee benefits liabilities
relating to pension and other post-employment rights acquired by Commissioners, MEPs and staff.

Overall, expenses increased by 16 %, to EUR 149 billion, when compared with 2017, mainly resulting
from expenses from programmes implemented by Member States which rose by approx. 24 %, or
EUR 19.8 billion, due to a higher level of expenses incurred in relation to the current phase of the
programmes where the implementation has increased. The main programmes contributing to this
increase were the ERDF & CF and ESF, which together represent an increase of EUR 17.2 billion.

As at 31 December 2018 the total assets were EUR 174.4 billion, reflecting an increase of approximately
5%. The key changes were:

   •   an increase of EUR 12.5 billion in the short-term receivables and recoverable amounts, directly
       related to the increase in 2018 revenue not cashed at the reporting date;

   •   the above effect was partially compensated by a decrease in the cash and cash equivalents of
       EUR 6 billion (see below);

   •   an increase of EUR 1 billion in financial assets mainly related to the provisioning of the Guarantee
       Fund for EFSI operations; and

   •   an increase of EUR 0.4 billion in property, plant and equipment (PPE) arising from further
       developments in the space assets (Galileo and Copernicus).

In general, the EU institutions and bodies strive to keep the amounts held as cash and cash equivalents
at a low level. The cash balance of EUR 18.1 billion at year-end is lower than in 2017 and is made up of
the following main elements:

   •   As regards own resources, the end of year treasury balance includes EUR 0.75 billion paid in
       advance by some of the Member States in relation to amending budget 6 adopted in 2018.

   •   An amount of EUR 1.4 billion of fines imposed by the Commission for breach of competition rules,
       definitively cashed in 2018 and not yet included in any amending budget is also part of the year-
       end treasury balance.

   •   The treasury balance also includes assigned revenue and other payment appropriations of
       EUR 7.4 billion.

Pre-financing

It should be noted that the level of pre-financing is significantly influenced by the MFF cycle – for
example at the beginning of an MFF period one can expect large advances to be paid to Member States
under cohesion policy. The Commission makes every effort to ensure that the levels of pre-financing are
maintained at an appropriate level. A balance has to be struck between ensuring sufficient funding for the
projects and the timely recognition of expenditure.

The total pre-financing (excluding other advances to Member States and contributions to the trust funds
Bêkou and Africa) on the EU balance sheet amounts to EUR 43.4 billion (2017: EUR 44.3 billion), almost
all of which relates to Commission activities. Some 60 % of the Commission's pre-financing concerns
shared management, which means that the implementation of the budget is delegated to Member States
(the Commission retains a supervisory role).

Commission pre-financing by management mode




The most significant pre-financing amount under shared management mode relates to ERDF & Cohesion
Fund (EUR 14.6 billion), which is at a similar level to 2017.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The following items are shown in accounting terms as financial instruments in the consolidated financial
statements of the EU:

   •   Financial Instruments financed by the EU budget: under this type of budget implementation funds
       are either already disbursed to the fiduciary accounts managed by the entrusted entities and stay
       available (as cash and cash equivalents and debt securities) to cover future guarantee calls or
       have been invested in equity;

   •   Financial assets held in guarantee funds for budgetary guarantees: under this type of budget
       implementation the EU provides guarantees to counterparts for which the funding is only partially
       provisioned via guarantee funds set-up by the Commission and thus creating contingent liabilities
       for the EU budget – see note 4.1; and

   •   Loans and related borrowings for financial assistance programmes.

Financial instruments financed by the EU budget

The significance and volume of financial instruments financed by the EU budget under direct and indirect
management increases from year to year. The basic concept behind this approach, in contrast to the
traditional method of budget implementation by giving grants and subsidies, is that for each euro spent
from the budget via financial instruments, the final beneficiary receives more than EUR 1 as financial
support due to the leverage effect. This use of the EU budget aims at maximising the impact of the funds
available. Financial instruments financed by the EU budget exist in the form of guarantee instruments,

Financial assets held in guarantee funds for budgetary guarantees

The Commission has set-up guarantee funds to cover budgetary guarantees (see note 4.1.1 of the
consolidated financial statements) given to the EIB group. These guarantee funds are provisioned by
payments from the EU budget so as to provide a liquidity cushion against potential losses from
guaranteed operations. Payments to the guarantee funds are invested in financial instruments including
debt securities, cash and term deposits. At 31 December 2018, the Commission holds financial assets in
the:

     •   Guarantee Fund for external actions of EUR 2.5 billion;

     •   EFSI Guarantee Fund of EUR 5.5 billion; and

     •   EFSD Guarantee Fund of EUR 0.3 billion.


Loans and related borrowings for financial assistance programmes

Financial support for Member States and third countries in the form of bilateral loans financed from the
capital markets with the guarantee of the EU budget is provided by the Commission under decisions of
the European Parliament and of the Council.

The Commission, acting on behalf of the EU, currently operates three main programmes:

     •   European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism (EFSM);
     •   Balance of Payments (BOP) assistance; and
     •   Macro-financial assistance (MFA), under which it may grant loans.

The capital required to fund the EU lending is raised on the capital markets or with financial institutions.

At 31 December 2018, the nominal amount of the loans granted for financial assistance under the EFSM
and BOP were:


                                                                                                                 EUR billion

EFSM

EFSM was created to provide financial assistance to all Member States experiencing or seriously
threatened by a severe economic financial disturbance caused by exceptional occurrences beyond their
control. The EFSM was used to provide financial assistance, conditional on the implementation of reforms,
to Ireland and Portugal between 2011 and 2014.

This programme expired and no additional loans can be drawn, though it remains in place for specific
tasks such as the lengthening of maturities for loans to Ireland and Portugal and providing bridging loans.




                                                                105
-----------------------Page 107 End-----------------------

                                  Annual accounts of the European Union 2018

The main points of the EFSM programme are as follows:

Ireland

   •      Ireland requested the full total of EUR 22.5 billion granted by the EFSM in December 2010. This
          amount was disbursed in eight instalments between January 2011 and March 2014;

   •      Ireland has the option to lengthen the maturity of the EFSM loans based on the extension of the
          maximum weighted average maturity to 19.5 years granted by the Council in 2013;

   •      Repayments of EUR 3.4 billion and EUR 0.5 billion were scheduled for April and October 2018,
          respectively. Ireland requested a maturity extension and the amounts were approved and
          successfully borrowed in the markets in 2018. They have been rescheduled for repayment in two
          instalments of EUR 2.4 billion and EUR 1.5 billion in 2025 and 2033 respectively.

Portugal


   •      Portugal has requested EUR 24.3 billion from a total of EUR 26 billion granted by the EFSM in May
          2011. This amount was disbursed in seven instalments between May 2011 and November 2014.
          A repayment of EUR 0.6 billion was scheduled for October 2018 but, as in the case of Ireland,
          Portugal requested the extension of the maturity and the loan was refinanced in the markets with
          a new maturity date in 2033.

BOP

The BOP is an assistance programme designed for countries outside the euro area that are experiencing
or are threatened by difficulties regarding their balance of payments. BOP assistance takes the form of
medium-term loans that are conditional on the implementation of policies designed to address underlying
economic problems. Typically, balance of payments assistance from the EU is offered in cooperation with
the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and other international institutions or countries.

The EU medium-term financial assistance under the BOP facility was activated in November 2008 to help
Hungary and subsequently Latvia and Romania, in January and May 2009 respectively, to restore market
confidence for a total commitment of EUR 14.6 billion. The BOP assistance programme for Hungary
expired in 2010 and has been fully repaid in 2016. Both assistance programmes for Latvia and Romania
expired in 2012, hence no additional instalments can be disbursed.

Additionally, the two precautionary assistance programmes for Romania expired in 2013 and 2015
without being drawn down.

The main points are as follows:

   •      During 2018, the beneficiary Member States of BOP have reimbursed on time and fully a total
          amount of EUR 1.45 billion out of which EUR 1.35 billion related to a capital reimbursement from
          Romania, the remaining being related to interest; and

   •      The outstanding amount at end 2018 is EUR 1.7 billion in total, EUR 0.7 billion for Latvia and
          EUR 1 billion for Romania.

MFA

The MFA is a form of financial aid extended by the EU to partner countries outside the EU experiencing a
balance of payments crisis. It takes the form of medium/long-term loans or grants, or a combination of
these, and is only available to countries benefiting from a disbursing IMF programme.

The outstanding loans at 31 December 2018 under the MFA programme were EUR 4.4 billion at nominal
amounts.

1.4.      LIABILITIES

The most significant items on the liability side of the balance sheet consist primarily of four items: (i)
pension obligation and other employee benefits liabilities; (ii) borrowings; (iii) payables to third parties
and (iv) accrued charges.

Composition of the liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet of the EU

                                   2%


                                                              34%

                        27%
                                                                    Pension & other employee benefits


                                                                    Borrowings


                                                                    Payables


                                                                    Accrued charges & deferred income
                       14%
                                                                    Other liabilities

                                        23%




As at 31 December 2018 the total liabilities were EUR 235.9 billion, remaining at the same level as the
previous year.
The key changes were related to the following effects:

    •   Payables fell by EUR 6.8 billion due to a decrease in amounts due to Member States related to
        own resources (i.e., EU budget contributions to be reimbursed at year-end following amending
        budget). This year there were additional contributions due from Member States;

    •   A slight decrease in the financial liabilities of EUR 1 billion resulting primarily from the repayment
        of borrowings (EUR 1.35 billion), related to the loan provided to Romania, under the BOP
        programme; and

    •   The above effects were offset by an increase of EUR 7.3 billion of the employee benefits liability.


Overall, all other items of the liability remained stable. It should be noted that long-term financial
liabilities (borrowings) increased, offset by a similar decrease in the short-term element. This relates to
an EFSM debt rescheduling for Ireland (EUR 3.9 billion) and Portugal (EUR 0.6 billion).

Net assets

The excess of liabilities over assets does not mean that the EU institutions and bodies are in financial
difficulties, rather it means that certain liabilities will be funded by future annual budgets. Many expenses
are recognised under accrual accounting rules in the current year although they may be actually paid in
the following or later years and funded using future budgets; the related revenues will only be accounted
for in future periods. The most significant amounts to be highlighted are the EAGF activities (the bulk of
which is usually paid in the first quarter of the following year) and the employee benefits liability (to be
paid over the next 30 plus years).




2. MANAGEMENT OF RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES OF
   EU BUDGET IMPLEMENTATION

2.1.      MACRO-ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT

The macro-economic environment of the EU13 has an impact on the ability of EU Member states to meet
their funding obligations towards the EU institutions and bodies and thus on the ability of the EU to
continue implementing EU policies.

The European economy grew for the sixth year in a row in 2018, but the growth rate was lower than
anticipated, especially in the second half of the year, due to a combination of internal and external
factors. Domestic factors include the disruption of European manufacturing sector (in particular car
production) in the third quarter and social tensions and fiscal policy uncertainty in some Member States.
Some of the most important external factors include the increased uncertainty regarding trade policies,
notably between US and China and a declining trend in global manufacturing output which resulted into
weaker global trade growth, which impacted the Euro area in particular.

Despite these developments, the fundamentals of the European economy remain strong and over the
next two years the economy is expected to continue growing but at a more moderate pace.

Euro area and EU GDP is estimated to have grown by 1.9 % in 2018. Euro area GDP is forecasted to grow
by 1.3 % in 2019 and 1.6 % in 2020, while EU GDP growth forecast is 1.5 % in 2019 and 1.7 % in 2020.

                                                    108
-----------------------Page 110 End-----------------------

                                 Annual accounts of the European Union 2018

Overall inflation averaged 1.7% in 2018, up from 1.5% in 2017. With oil price assumptions for 2019 and
2020 now lower than in autumn 2018, euro area inflation is forecast to moderate to 1.4% in 2019 before
picking up mildly to 1.5% in 2020. For the EU as a whole, inflation is forecast to average 1.6% this year
and then pick up to 1.8% in 2020.

The euro area labour market improved further in the first three quarters of 2018. The number of
employed persons has reached in the third quarter of 2018 the highest level ever recorded in the euro
area and in December 2018 the unemployment rate in the euro area stood at 7.9%, its lowest level since
October 2008.

Risks to the economic outlook remain substantial, as trade tensions and their uncertain evolution remain
a concern. The US may be impacted by abrupt fiscal policy changes. The Chinese economy may be
slowing down more sharply than anticipated. Global financial markets and many emerging markets are
vulnerable to sudden changes in risk appetite and growth expectation. For the EU, the domestic factors
could be more long lasting than anticipated and “Brexit” remains a source of uncertainty.

On the positive side, still favourable labour market conditions could result in stronger domestic demand
while a more extensive use of EU funds in recipient countries could trigger additional investments. The
outlook for global GDP remains stable, with it being expected to expand at 3.8% for the next two years.



2.2. BUDGETARY CONTINGENT LIABILITIES FOR FINANCIAL
     ASSISTANCE

The EU borrowing and lending activities for financial assistance programmes are non-budget operations.
In general, funds raised are on-lent back-to-back to the beneficiary country, i.e. with the same coupon,
maturity and amount. Notwithstanding the back-to-back methodology, the debt service of the funding
instruments is a legal obligation of the EU, which will ensure that all payments are made fully and in a
timely manner. The Commission has put procedures in place to ensure the repayment of borrowings even
in case of a loan default.

Borrowings of the EU constitute direct and unconditional obligations of the EU and are guaranteed by the
EU Member States (budgetary contingent liabilities). Borrowings undertaken to fund loans to countries
outside the EU are covered by the Guarantee Fund for external actions. Should a beneficiary Member
State default, the debt service will be drawn from the available treasury balance of the Commission, if
possible. If that would not be possible, the Commission would draw the necessary funds from the
Member States. EU Member States are legally obliged, according to the EU own resources legislation
(Article 14 of Council Regulation 609/2014), to make available sufficient funds to meet the EU’s
obligations. Thus investors are only exposed to the credit risk of the EU, not to that of the beneficiary of
loans funded. “Back-to-back” lending ensures that the EU budget does not assume any interest rate or
foreign exchange risk.

For each country programme, the EP, the Council and the Commission decisions determine the overall
granted amount, the number of instalments to be disbursed, and the maximum (average) maturity of the
loan package. Subsequently, the Commission and the beneficiary country agree the loan/funding
parameters, in particular the maturity of instalments. In addition, except for the first one, all instalments
of the loan depend on compliance with policy conditions, in the context of a joint EU/IMF financial
assistance, which is another factor influencing the timing of funding operations. This implies that the
timing and maturities of issuances are dependent on the related EU lending activity. Funding is
exclusively denominated in euro and the maturity spectrum is from 3 to 30 years.

The Inter-governmental financial stability mechanisms European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) and
European Stability Mechanism (ESM) are outside the EU Treaty framework and thus not included in the
consolidated annual accounts of the EU.


2.3.      BUDGETARY GUARANTEES

The EU has given the EIB Group guarantees on loans granted outside of the EU and on debt and equity
operations covered by the EFSI guarantee. At 31 December 2018, the EU discloses in the notes to its
consolidated financial statements (see note 4.1.1) contingent liabilities for both guarantees, while the
amounts constituting present obligations are recognised as provisions in the financial statements (see
note 2.10 of the consolidated financial statements). In order to mitigate the risk that guarantee calls by
the EIB Group could have on the EU budget, the EU has created dedicated guarantee funds, i.e. the
Guarantee Fund for external actions and the EFSI Guarantee Fund.

The Guarantee Fund for external actions is provisioned by the EU budget so as to cover 9 % of the
guaranteed loans outstanding at year-end for EIB external lending mandate activities to third countries.
At 31 December 2018, the total asset value of EUR 2.5 billion covers an exposure of amounts disbursed
of EUR 20.7 billion.

The EFSI Guarantee Fund started its activity in 2016. Pursuant to the amended EFSI Regulation
(Regulation EU 2017/2396) the EFSI EU guarantee ceiling was increased to EUR 26 billion (from the initial
EUR 16 billion) and the boundary for the guarantee fund decreased to 35 % (from the initial 50 %) of the
total EU guarantee obligation. Therefore, the EFSI Guarantee Fund is now expected to reach a total
amount of EUR 9.1 billion. The EFSI Agreement was amended in 2018, in line with the amended EFSI
Regulation. The total assets that make up the EFSI Guarantee Fund at 31 December 2018 is
EUR 5.5 billion and that covers an exposure of disbursed amounts of EUR 15.8 billion.

                                Annual accounts of the European Union 2018

Pursuant to EFSD Regulation (Regulation EU 2017/1601), a new guarantee fund has been established:
the EFSD Guarantee Fund. The first EU budget contributions into the fund were received in 2018 but no
guarantee agreements were effective as at 31 December 2018.


2.4.     NEW ENTRANTS' RESERVE (NER) 300

The NER 300 fund originates from the sale of the Emission Trading Scheme allowances and belongs to
the Member States who use the money to finance innovative low-carbon energy demonstration projects.
The Commission manages the programme on behalf of the Member States, while the EIB is responsible
for the asset management of the NER 300 Fund and acts as a technical advisor, under the Cooperation
Agreement with the Commission. Since neither the revenues from the allowances nor the expenses for
the projects financed are part of the EU budget, these amounts are not accounted for in the EU accounts.

The budget result of the EU is returned to the Member States in 2019 through deduction of their amounts
due. It is calculated in accordance with Article 1(1) of Council Regulation No 608/2014 laying down
implementing measures for the system of own resources. More information can be found under
Calculation of the budget result.

    1.1 Revenue for the financial year: refers to table 3.1 “Summary of the implementation of EU Budget
        Revenue”, column 8 “Total Revenue”.

    1.2 Payments against current year appropriations: refer to table 4.3 “MFF – Implementation of
        Payment appropriations”, column 2 “Payments made from adopted budget and column 4
        “Payments made from assigned revenue”.

    1.3 Payment appropriations carried over to year N+1: refer to table 4.3 “MFF – Implementation of
        Payment appropriations”, column 7 automatic carry-overs plus column 8 carry-over by decision.

    1.4 Cancellation of unused payment appropriations carried over from year N-1: takes into account
        the amount of payment appropriations (automatic and on decision) at the end of previous year
        and current year’s “Payments made from carryovers” as in column 3 of table 4.3 “MFF –
        Implementation of Payment appropriations”.

    1.5 Evolution of the total assigned revenue appropriations at year-end: calculates the difference of
        the amount of assigned revenue appropriations at the end of previous year (plus) and the
        amount of assigned revenue appropriations at the end of the current year (as in column 9 of
        table 4.3 “MFF – Implementation of Payment appropriations” - minus) to obtain the net variation
        of assigned revenue in the current year.

    1.6 Exchange rate differences include realised and non-realised exchange rate differences.

NOTES TO THE BUDGETARY IMPLEMENTATION
REPORTS
      THE EU BUDGET FRAMEWORK
The budgetary accounts are kept in accordance with the Financial Regulation (FR) and its rules of
application. The general budget is the instrument which provides for and authorises the Union's revenue
and expenditure every year, within the ceilings and other provisions laid down in the Multiannual
Financial Framework in line with the legislative acts concerning multiannual programmes adopted under
that framework.

The above table shows the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) ceilings at current prices. 2018 was
the fifth financial year covered by the MFF 2014-2020. The overall ceiling for commitment appropriations
for 2018 was EUR 159 514 million, equivalent to 1.02 % of the EU GNI, whilst the corresponding ceiling
for payment appropriations was EUR 154 565 million, or 0.98 % of the EU GNI valid throughout the
budgetary year 2018.

New flexibility provisions have been agreed for the 2014-2020 MFF. One of the new provisions is a
possibility to transfer unspent margins under the payment ceilings to the following years – via the Global
Margin for Payments in the framework of the technical adjustment of the MFF for the following year.
Therefore, the unspent amount from 2016 (EUR 13 991 million in current prices) and 2017 (EUR 16
414 million in current prices) was transferred to the years 2018-2020 and the ceilings of 2016-2020 were
adjusted accordingly – see the above mentioned technical adjustment of the MFF for 2018 and the
technical adjustment for 2019 (COM(2018) 282 of 23 May 2018).

On 23 May 2018 the Commission adopted a Communication on technical adjustment of the financial
framework for 2019 in line with movements in GNI (ESA 2010) (COM(2018) 282 of 23 May 2018).

                                  Annual accounts of the European Union 2018

An explanation of the various headings of the MFF is given below:

Heading 1 – Smart and inclusive growth

This heading is divided into two separate, but interlinked components:

1a        Competitiveness for growth and jobs, encompassing expenditure on research and innovation,
education and training, Connecting Europe Facility, social policy, the internal market and accompanying
policies.

1b        Economic, social and territorial cohesion, designed to enhance convergence of the least
developed Member States and regions, to complement the EU strategy for sustainable development
outside the less prosperous regions and to support inter regional cooperation.

Heading 2 – Sustainable growth: natural resources

Heading 2 includes the common agricultural and fisheries policies, and the environmental measures, in
particular the Life + program.

Heading 3 – Security and citizenship

Heading 3 (Security and citizenship) reflects the growing importance attached to certain fields where the
EU has been assigned particular tasks – justice and home affairs, border protection, immigration and
asylum policy, public health and consumer protection, culture, youth, information and dialogue with
citizens.

Heading 4 – Global Europe

Heading 4 covers all external action, including development cooperation, humanitarian aid, pre-accession
and neighbourhood instruments. The EDF remains outside of the EU budget and is not part of the MFF.

Heading 5 - Administration

This heading covers administrative expenditure for all institutions, pensions and the European Schools.
Administrative costs make up the total of the expenditure of institutions other than the Commission.

Heading 6 - Compensations

In accordance with the political agreement that new Member States should not become net-contributors
to the budget at the very beginning of their membership, compensation was foreseen under this heading.
This amount was available as transfers to them to balance their budgetary receipts and contributions.

Heading 9 – Special instruments

Flexibility mechanisms enable the EU to mobilise the necessary funds to react to unforeseen events such
as crisis and emergency situations. Their scope, financial allocation and operating modalities are provided
for in the MFF regulation and the Interinstitutional Agreement. In the current context of reduced
expenditure, they also ensure that budgetary resources can respond to evolving priorities, so that every
euro is used where it is most needed. Most of the flexibility mechanisms are therefore kept outside the
MFF and the funding can be mobilised above the expenditure ceilings.


1.2. MFF DETAILED HEADINGS (PROGRAMMES)

The headings of the MFF are further broken down into detailed headings, corresponding to the main
spending programmes (e.g. Horizon 2020, Erasmus+ etc.). Underlying legal bases for budget
implementation are adopted at this programme level. Programmes are the commonly used structure for
reporting on implementation and results. Tables by programme are available in the budgetary
implementation reports (see tables 4.6 - 4.10 below).

1.3. ANNUAL BUDGET

Every year, the Commission estimates all the Institutions' revenue and expenditure for the year and
draws up a draft budget which it sends to the budgetary authority. On the basis of this draft budget, the
Council sets out its position, which is then the subject of negotiations between the two arms of the
budgetary authority. The President of the EP declares that the joint draft has been finally adopted, thus
making the budget enforceable. During the year in question, amending budgets are adopted. The task of
executing the budget is mainly the responsibility of the Commission.

The budget structure for the Commission consists of administrative and operational appropriations. The
other Institutions have only administrative appropriations. Furthermore, the budget distinguishes
between two types of appropriations: non-differentiated and differentiated. Non-differentiated
appropriations are used to finance operations of an annual nature (which comply with the principle of
annuality). Differentiated appropriations are used in order to reconcile the principle of annuality with the
need to manage multiannual operations. Differentiated appropriations are split into commitment and
payment appropriations:

-     commitment appropriations: cover the total cost of the legal obligations entered into for the current
      financial year for operations extending over a number of years. However, budgetary commitments for
      actions extending over more than one financial year may be broken down over several years into
      annual instalments where the basic act so provides.

-     payment appropriations: cover expenditure arising from commitments entered into in the current
      financial year and/or earlier financial years.

In the accounts, the types of funding are grouped into two main items:

      •       Final adopted budget appropriations; and
      •       Additional appropriations containing:
          –     Carryovers from previous year (the financial regulation allows for a limited number of cases
                to carry unspent amounts from the previous year into the current year); and
          –     Assigned revenue arising from reimbursements, contributions from third parties/countries to
                EU programs and work performed for third parties are assigned directly to the corresponding
                expenditure budget lines and constitute the third pillar of funding.

All funding types together form the available appropriations.


1.4. REVENUE

1.4.1.        Own resources revenue

The vast majority of revenue comes from own resources, which consist of the following categories:

(1)           Traditional own resources (TOR): usually account for +/- 14 % of own resource revenue.

(2)       Value added tax (VAT) based resource: usually accounts for around 12 % of own resource
          revenue.

(3)       Gross national income (GNI) based resource: usually accounts for +/- 74 % of own resource
          revenue.

The allocation of own resources is made in accordance with the rules laid down in the Council Decision
No. 2014/335/EU, Euratom of 26 May 2014 on the system of the EU's own resources (ORD 2014). This
decision has entered into force on 1 October 2016 and applied retroactively from 1 January 2014.

The total amount of own resources allocated to the Union to cover annual appropriations for payments
shall not exceed 1.20 % of the sum of all the Member States' GNIs.

                                 Annual accounts of the European Union 2018

1.4.2.    Traditional own resources (TOR)

Traditional own resources (TOR) consist of customs duties (levied on imports from third countries) and
sugar levies (paid by sugar producers to finance expenditure on the sugar common organisation of the
market) levied on economic operators and collected by Member States on behalf of the EU. However,
Member States keep 20 % as a compensation for their collection costs. All established traditional own
resource amounts must be entered in one or other of the accounts kept by the competent authorities:

-   In the ordinary accounts provided for in Article 6(3) of Regulation No 609/2014: all amounts
    recovered or guaranteed.
-   In the separate accounts provided for also in the above Article: all amounts not yet recovered and/or
    not guaranteed; amounts guaranteed but challenged may also be entered in this account.

Traditional own resources must be entered in the Commission's account with the treasury or national
central bank by the Member State at the latest on the first working day following the 19th day of the
second month following the month during which the entitlement was established (or recovered in the
case of the separate account).


1.4.3.    Value added tax (VAT)

Value added tax (VAT) is levied on Member States' VAT bases, which are harmonised for this purpose in
accordance with EU rules. However, the VAT base is capped at 50 % of each Member State’s GNI. The
uniform VAT rate applied is fixed at 0.30 % except for the period 2014-2020 in which the rate of call for
Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden was fixed at 0.15 %.


1.4.4.    Gross national income (GNI)

The resource based on gross national income (GNI) is used to finance the part of the budget not covered
by any other sources of revenue. The same percentage rate is levied on each Member States' GNI, which
is established in accordance with EU rules.

VAT and GNI-based resources are determined on the basis of forecasts of relevant bases made when the
draft budget is being prepared. These forecasts are subsequently revised and updated during the budget
year in question by means of an amending budget. Differences between the amounts due by the Member
States by reference to the actual bases and the sums actually paid on the basis of the (revised) forecasts,
either positive or negative, are called by the Commission from the Member States for the first working
day of June of the second year following the budget year in question. Corrections may still be made to the
actual VAT and GNI bases during the subsequent four years, unless a reservation is issued. These
reservations have to be seen as potential claims on the Member States for uncertain amounts as their
financial impact cannot be estimated with accuracy. When the exact amount can be determined, the
corresponding VAT and GNI-based resources are called either in connection with the VAT and GNI
balances exercise or by individual calls for funds.


1.4.5.    UK correction

A budgetary imbalance correction mechanism in favour of the United Kingdom (reducing their own
resource payments while increasing the payments of other Member States) was instituted by the
European Council in Fontainebleau (June 1984). Germany, Austria, Sweden and Netherlands benefit from
a reduced financing of the UK correction (restricted to one fourth of their normal share).


1.4.6.    Gross reduction

The European Council of 7-8 February 2013 concluded that Denmark, the Netherlands and Sweden
should benefit from gross reductions in their annual contributions based on GNI for the period 2014-2020
while Austria only benefited from gross reductions for the period 2014-2016. The annual reductions are
as follows: Denmark EUR 130 million, the Netherlands EUR 695 million and Sweden EUR 185 million.

1.5. CALCULATION OF THE BUDGET RESULT

The budget result of the EU is returned to the Member States during the following year through deduction
of their amounts due for that year.

The amounts of own resources entered in the accounts are those credited during the course of the year
to the accounts opened in the Commission's name by the governments of the Member States. Revenue
comprises also, in the case of a surplus, the budget result for the previous financial year. The other
revenue entered in the accounts is the amount actually received during the course of the year.

For the purposes of calculating the budget result for the year, expenditure comprises payments made
against the year's appropriations plus any of the appropriations for that year that are carried over to the
following year. Payments made against the year's appropriations means payments that are made by the
Accounting Officer by 31 December of the financial year. For the EAGF, payments are those effected by
the Member States between 16 October N-1 and 15 October N, provided that the Accounting Officer was
notified of the commitment and authorisation by 31 January N+1. EAGF expenditure may be subject to a
conformity decision following controls in the Member States.

The budget result comprises two elements: the result of the EU and the result of the participation of the
EFTA countries belonging to the European Economic Area (EEA). In accordance with Article 1(1) of
Regulation No 608/2014 laying down implementing measures for the system of own resources, this result
represents the difference between:

-   total revenue received for the financial year; and

-   total payments made against current year's appropriations plus the total amount of that year's
    appropriations carried over to the following year.

The following are added to or deducted from the resulting figure:

-   the net balance of cancellations of payment appropriations carried over from previous years and any
    payments which, because of fluctuations in the euro rate, exceed non-differentiated appropriations
    carried over from the previous year;

-   the evolution of assigned revenue; and

-   the net exchange-rate gains or losses recorded during the year.

Appropriations carried over from the previous financial year in respect of contributions by and work for
third parties, which by definition never lapse, are included as additional appropriations for the financial
year. This explains the difference between carryovers from the previous year in the year N budget
implementation reports and those carried over to the following year in the year N-1 budget
implementation reports. Appropriations made available again following the repayment of payments on
account are disregarded when calculating the budget result.

Payment appropriations carried over include: automatic carryovers and carryovers by decision. The
cancellation of unused payment appropriations carried over from the previous year shows the
cancellations of appropriations carried over automatically and by decision.

In accordance with the Financial Regulation, the economic result of the year is calculated on the basis of
accrual accounting principles, while the budget result is based on modified cash accounting rules. As the
economic result and the budget result both cover the same underlying transactions, it is a useful control
to ensure that they are reconcilable.

Reconciling items - Revenue

The actual budgetary revenue for a financial year corresponds to the revenue collected from entitlements
established in the course of the year and amounts collected from entitlements established in previous
years. Therefore the entitlements established in the current year but not yet collected are to be deducted
from the economic result for reconciliation purposes as they do not form part of budgetary revenue. On
the contrary the entitlements established in previous years and collected in current year must be added
to the economic result for reconciliation purposes.

The accrued revenue mainly consists of accrued revenue for agriculture, own resources, interests and
dividends. Only the net-effect, i.e. accrued revenue for current year minus reversal accrued revenue from
previous year, is taken into consideration.

Reconciling items - Expenditure

The accrued expenses mainly consists of accruals made for year-end cut-off purposes, i.e. eligible
expenses incurred by beneficiaries of EU funds but not yet reported to the Commission. Only the net-
effect, i.e. accrued expenses for current year minus reversal accrued expenses from previous year, is
taken into consideration. Payments made in the current year relating to invoices registered in prior years
are part of current year's budgetary expenditure and therefore must be added to the economic result for
reconciliation purposes.

The net effect of pre-financing is the combination of (1) the new pre-financing amounts paid in the
current year and recognised as budgetary expenditure of the year and (2) the clearing of the pre-
financing through eligible costs accepted during the current year. The latter represent an expense in
accrual terms but not in the budgetary accounts since the payment of the initial pre-financing had
already been considered as a budgetary expenditure at the time of its payment.

As well as the payments made against the year's appropriations, the appropriations for that year that are
carried forward to the next year also need to be taken into account in calculating the budget result for
the year (in accordance with Article 1(1) of Regulation No 608/2014). The same applies for the budgetary


                                                    122

                                 Annual accounts of the European Union 2018

payments made in the current year from carry-overs from previous years, and the cancellation of unused
payment appropriations.

The movement in provisions relates to year-end estimates made in the financial statements (employee
benefits mainly) that do not impact the budgetary accounts. Other reconciling amounts comprise different
elements such as asset amortisation/depreciation, asset acquisitions, capital lease payments and financial
participations for which the budgetary and accrual accounting treatments differ.




    IMPLEMENTATION OF THE 2018 EU BUDGET –
    COMMENTARY

2.1. REVENUE

In the initial adopted EU budget, signed by the President of the European Parliament on 30 November
2017, the amount of payment appropriations was EUR 144 681 million and the amount to be financed by
own resources totalled EUR 142 832 million. The revenue and expenditure estimates in the initial budget
are typically adjusted during the budgetary year, such modifications being presented in amending
budgets. Adjustments in the GNI-based own resources ensure that budgeted revenue matches exactly
budgeted expenditure. In accordance with the principle of equilibrium, budget revenue and expenditure
(payment appropriations) must be in balance.

During 2018, six amending budgets were adopted. Taking them into account, the final adopted revenue
for 2018 amounted to EUR 144 767.9 million and the total financed by own resources was
(EUR 142 363.7 million). The main factor for the reduction of Member States' contributions in 2018 was
the surplus from the previous financial year (EUR 555.5 million) slightly counterbalanced by a net
increase of payment appropriations (EUR 86.9 million).

As far as the own resources result is concerned, the collection of traditional own resources was very close
to the forecasted amounts. This is primarily because the budget estimates were modified at the time the
amending budget 6/2018 was established (based mainly on the forecasts of spring 2018).

The final Member States' VAT and GNI payments also correspond closely to the final budgetary estimate.
The differences between the forecasted amounts and the amounts actually paid are due to the differences
between the euro rates used for budgetary purposes and the rates in force at the time when the Member
States outside the EMU actually made their payments.

As far as the VAT and GNI balances are concerned the rules are set out in Article 10 b of the Making
Available Regulation (Regulation 609/2014). The procedure does not entail a budgetary amendment and
therefore the Commission directly requests the Member States to pay the net amounts. The impact for
the EU budget was close to zero due to this netting system.

The heading "Contributions and refunds in connection with EU agreements and programmes" concerns
mainly revenue from financial corrections (ESIF, EAGF and EAFRD), the participation of third countries in
research programs, the clearance of accounts in agricultural funds and other contributions and refunds to
EU programs/activities. A substantial part of this total is made up of earmarked revenue, which typically
gives rise to the entering of additional appropriations on the expenditure side. In 2018, these
contributions totalled (EUR 12.8 billion).

The revenue from fines relates mainly to fines in the field of competition.

2.2. EXPENDITURE

The 2018 budget aimed to achieve the right balance between the implementation of ongoing
programmes and addressing newer challenges. It therefore built on commitments made in previous
years, and made use of the existing room for flexibility to respond to challenges in line with the 2014-
2020 Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF). The mid-term revision of the 2014-2020 MFF increased the
capacity of the EU budget to address challenges and meet future needs.

In line with the annual evolution foreseen in the MFF, appropriations proposed in the draft budget were
set at EUR 160.7 billion (1.4 % higher when compared to the 2017 budget) in commitments, and
EUR 144.7 billion (8 %) in payments, corresponding to 1.02 % and 0.92 % of EU GNI, respectively.
Concerning payments, the abnormal payment backlog observed at the beginning of the MFF was resolved
in 2016, and it was expected that many programmes will reach cruising speed, notably in 'Economic,
social and territorial cohesion' (heading 1b of the budget).

In 2018, the Commission did not present any significant adjustments via amending budgets. The only
adjustments were proposed in Amending Budget No 6 where the level of payment and commitment
appropriations was adjusted in order to align it more closely to the estimates of needs in conjunction with
the Global Transfer.

2018 Implementation of available appropriations

The 2018 implementation for all types of appropriations (budget, carry-overs from 2017 and assigned
revenue) was 97 % for commitments and 94 % for payments. Appropriations from the budget were fully
implemented in 2018 (99.9 % in commitments and 98.5 % in payments). The implementation rate rises
to 99.8 % of commitment appropriations and 99.7 % of payment appropriations when assuming full
consumption of the amounts carried over to 2019.

All headings reached high levels of implementation. As regards the special instruments, full
implementation is not an objective as they are only mobilised in crises or unforeseen circumstances.

Outstanding Commitments

Outstanding commitments (RAL, committed amounts not yet paid for) stood at EUR 281.2 billion at the
end of 2018. The increase of RAL was lower than foreseen reaching EUR 13.5 billion, as a result of the
combined effect of the additional commitment appropriations from Amending Budget No 3 (linked to the
extension of the Facility for Refugees in Turkey) and a better implementation than expected of
commitment and payment appropriations originating from all types of sources, i.e. voted, carried-over
from 2017 and assigned revenue.

A more detailed analysis of budgetary adjustments, their relevant context, justification and impact is
presented in the Commission's Report on Budgetary and Financial Management 2018, Part A "Overview
at budget level" and Part B dealing with each heading of the Multiannual Financial Framework.

Budget result

Compared to the budget result of 2017, which was a historical low of EUR 0.56 billion, the budget result
of 2018 is higher and amounts to EUR 1.8 billion; it arises primarily from the revenue side, where
revenues from contributions and refunds in connection with Union agreements and programmes were
material in 2018 (EUR 12.8 billion). Payment appropriations reached nearly full implementation (94 %),
unspent amounts (5 %) were allowed for carry-over to 2019 and the amount not used is not significant.

The consolidated reports on the implementation of the general budget of the EU include, as in previous years, the budget implementation of all Institutions
since within the EU budget a separate budget for each Institution is established.

The budget and implementation of Agencies is not consolidated within the EU budget. The Commission subsidy is part of the EU budget.

Concerning the EEAS, it should be noted that, in addition to its own budget, it also receives contributions from the Commission of EUR 141.7 million (2017:
EUR 144 million) and the EDF and the Trust Funds of EUR 70.1 million (2017: EUR 72 million) covering the costs of Commission's staff in the delegations
financed under the EDF and the Trust Funds including assigned revenue generated in the year from these contributions. These budget credits are put at the
disposal of the EEAS (as assigned revenue) so as to cover primarily the costs of Commission staff working in the EU delegations, these delegations being
administratively managed by the EEAS.

GLOSSARY

Actuarial assumptions

Assumptions used to calculate the costs of future events that affect the pension liability.

Actuarial gains and losses

For a defined benefit scheme, the changes in actuarial deficits or surpluses. They arise as a result of
differences between the previous actuarial assumptions and what has actually occurred and due to effects
of changes in actuarial assumptions.

Administrative appropriations

Administrative appropriations cover the running costs of the Institutions and entities (staff, buildings,
office equipment).

Adopted budget

Draft budget becomes the adopted budget as soon as it is approved by the Budgetary Authority.

Amending budget

Decision adopted during the budget year to amend (increase, decrease, transfer) aspects of the adopted
budget of that year.

Amounts to be called from Member States

These represent expenses incurred during the reporting period that will need to be funded by future
budgets, i.e. by the EU Member States. This is a consequence of the co-existence of accruals based
financial statements and a cash based budget.

Annual Activity Report (AAR)

Annual Activity Reports indicate the results of   operations by reference to objectives set, associated risks
and the internal control structure, inter alia.   Since the 2001 budget exercise for the Commission and
since 2003 for all European Union institutions,   the ‘authorising officer by delegation’ must submit an AAR
to his/her institution on the performance of      his/her duties, together with financial and management
information.

Appropriations

Budget funding. The budget forecasts both commitments and payments (cash or bank transfers to the
beneficiaries). Appropriations for commitments and payments often differ (differentiated appropriations)
because multi annual programmes and projects are usually fully committed in the year they are decided
and are paid over the years as the implementation of the programme and project progresses. Non-
differentiated appropriations apply to administrative expenditure, for agricultural market support and
direct payments and commitment appropriations equal payment appropriations.

Assigned revenue

Dedicated revenue received to finance specific items of expenditure. The main source of external
assigned revenue is financial contributions from third countries to programmes financed by the Union.
The main source of internal assigned revenue is revenue from third parties in respect of goods, services
or work supplied at their request; revenue arising from the repayment of amounts wrongly paid and
revenue from the sale of publications and films.

                                      Annual accounts of the European Union 2018

Available for sale financial assets

All financial assets (except derivatives) that are according to International Public Sector Accounting
Standards measured at fair value and for which the changes in fair value are to be recognised in a
reserve in net assets until derecognition (or impairment).

Budget line

As far as the budget structure is concerned, revenue and expenditure are shown in the budget in
accordance with a binding nomenclature which reflects the nature and purpose of each item, as imposed
by the budgetary authority. The individual headings (title, chapter, article or line) provide a formal
description of the nomenclature.

Cancellation of appropriations

Unused appropriations that may no longer be used.

Carryover of appropriations

Exception to the principle of annuality in so far as appropriations that could not be used in a given budget
year may, under strict conditions, be exceptionally carried over for use during the following year.

Commitment

Legal pledge to provide finance subject to certain conditions. The EU commits itself to reimbursing its
share of the costs of an EU funded project. Today’s commitments are tomorrow’s payments. Today’s
payments are yesterday’s commitments.

Commitment appropriation

Commitment appropriations cover the total cost of legal obligations                      (contracts,   grant
agreements/decisions) that could be signed in the current financial year.

Current service cost

The increase in scheme liabilities arising from service in the current financial year.

Decommitment

An act whereby a previous commitment (or part of it) is cancelled.

Defined benefit scheme

A pension or other retirement benefit scheme where the scheme rules define the benefits independently
of the contributions payable, and the benefits are not directly related to the investments of the scheme.
The scheme may be funded or unfunded.

Derivatives

Financial instruments whose value is linked to changes in the value of another financial instrument, an
indicator or a commodity. In contrast to the holder of a primary financial instrument (e.g. a government
bond), who has an unqualified right to receive cash (or some other economic benefit) in the future, the
holder of a derivative has only a qualified right to receive such a benefit. An example of a derivative is
currency forward contract.

Direct management

Mode of budget implementation. Under direct management the budget is implemented directly by
Commission services, Executive Agencies or Trust Funds.

Discount rate

The rate used to adjust for the time value of money. Discounting is a technique used to compare costs
and benefits that occur in different time periods.

                                                        163
-----------------------Page 165 End-----------------------

                                   Annual accounts of the European Union 2018

Effective interest rate

The rate that discounts estimated future cash receipts or payments over the expected life of the financial
asset or financial liability to the net carrying amount of the asset or liability.

Financial assets or liabilities at fair value through surplus or deficit

All financial assets or liabilities that are according to International Public Sector Accounting Standards
measured at fair value and for which the changes in fair value are to be recognised in surplus or deficit of
the period (i.e. derivatives).

Financial correction

The purpose of financial corrections is to protect the EU budget from the burden of erroneous or irregular
expenditure. For expenditure under shared management, the task of recovering incorrect payments is
primarily the responsibility of the Member State.

A 'confirmed' financial correction has been accepted by the Member State concerned. A 'decided' financial
correction has been adopted by a Commission decision and is always a net correction, where the Member
State is required to reimburse irregular funds to the EU budget, thus leading to a definitive reduction of
the allocated envelope to the Member State concerned. Confirmed and decided financial corrections are
reported in this publication as one category.

An 'implemented' financial correction has corrected the observed irregularity.

Indirect management

Mode of budget implementation. Under indirect management the Commission confers tasks of budget
implementation to bodies of EU law or national law.

Interruptions and suspensions

If the Commission finds, based on its own work or the information reported by audit authorities, that a
Member State has failed to remedy serious shortcomings in the management and control systems and/or
to correct irregular expenditure which had been declared and certified, it may interrupt or suspend
payments.

Irregularity

An irregularity is an act which does not comply with EU rules and which has a potentially negative impact
on EU financial interests, but which may be the result of genuine errors committed either by beneficiaries
claiming funds or by the authorities responsible for making payments. If an irregularity is committed
deliberately, it constitutes fraud.

Lapsing appropriations

Unused appropriations to be cancelled at the end of the financial year. Lapsing means the cancellation of
all or part of the authorisation to make expenditures and/or incur liabilities which is represented by an
appropriation. Only for Joint Undertakings, as specified in their Financial Rules, any unused
appropriations may be entered in the estimate of revenue and expenditure of up to the following three
financial years (the so-called "N+3" rule). Hence, lapsing appropriations for JUs could be reactivated until
financial year "N+3"

Own resources

Represent the main funding for the EU institutions and bodies and are defined in the own resources
regulation 609/2014. Own resources comprise GNI-based resources, VAT-based resources and traditional
own resources.

Payment appropriations

Payment appropriations cover expenditure due in the current year, arising from legal commitments
entered in the current year and/or earlier years.

                                 Annual accounts of the European Union 2018

Pre-financing

A payment intended to provide the beneficiary with a float. It may be split into a number of payments in
accordance with the provisions of the underlying contract, decision, agreement or the basic legal act. The
float or advance is either used for the purpose for which it was provided during the period defined in the
agreement or it is repaid.

Preventive measure

Preventive measures, which are at the Commission’s disposal to protect the EU budget when it is aware
of potential deficiencies, include suspensions and interruptions of payments from the EU budget to the
operational programme.

Reste à Liquider (RAL)

Represents the amount where a budgetary commitment has been made but the subsequent payment is
not yet done. They represent payment obligations for the EU for future years and stem directly from the
existence of multi annual programmes and the dissociation between commitment and payment
appropriations.

Shared management

Mode of budget implementation. Under shared management budget implementation tasks are delegated
to Member States. About 80 % of the EU expenditure falls under this implementation mode.

Traditional own resources

These represent revenue for the EU and are part of the 'own resources' which fund the activities of the
EU. Traditional own resources are defined in the own resource regulation 609/2014 and comprise
customs duties and sugar levies.

Transfers (between budget lines)

Transfers between budget lines imply the relocation of appropriations from one budget line to another, in
the course of the financial year, and thereby they constitute an exception to the budgetary principle of
specification. They are, however, expressly authorised by the Treaty on the Functioning of the European
Union under the conditions laid down in the Financial Regulation (FR). The FR identifies different types of
transfers depending on whether they are between or within budget titles, chapters, articles or headings
and require different levels of authorisation.
