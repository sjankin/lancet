From the Executive Director
Now more than ever, we must ensure
that the marginalized, the forgotten—the
ones often left behind—can exercise their
fundamental human right to decide, free
of coercion, discrimination and violence,
when or how often to have children.
UNFPA, the United Nations Population
Fund, is proud to have enabled millions of
women of childbearing age to exercise that
right and to have helped to nearly double
modern contraceptive use worldwide from
36 per cent in 1970 to 64 per cent in 2016.
Increasing access to voluntary planning
has not only empowered more women
to make decisions about the timing and
spacing of pregnancies, but it has also led
to better health outcomes for women and
has helped reduce maternal deaths globally
from 532,000 in 1990 to 303,000 in 2016.

Dr. Babatunde Osotimehin

But the number of maternal deaths is still
too high. We must get to zero. No woman
should die giving life.
We know how to reach zero maternal
deaths. But in many cases, resources
are still insufficient to make sure every
pregnant woman has at least four antenatal
care visits, every birth is attended by skilled
workers and life-saving medicines are
available to everyone who needs them.

In times of budgetary constraints,
governments need to reassure
constituencies that investing in UNFPA
yields results.

This annual report shows how funds
entrusted to UNFPA have enabled us
to protect and promote the health and
rights of millions of women and young
people and enable them to realize
their full potential.

This annual report shows how funds
entrusted to UNFPA have enabled us to
protect and promote the health and rights
of millions of women and young people
and enable them to realize their
full potential.
The numbers in this report speak
for themselves.
In 2016, for example, contraceptives
supplied by UNFPA reached 20.9 million
people, helped avert an estimated 11.7
million unintended pregnancies and nearly
3.7 million unsafe abortions and prevent
an estimated 29,000 maternal deaths.
The returns on donor and developing
country investments in UNFPA are
quantifiable. But the more important
measure of success is the survival, health
and well-being of women and young
people whose rights have been upheld and
whose lives have been transformed as a
result of our programmes in 155 countries
and territories.

Without continued political and financial
support from donor countries and renewed
commitments from developing nations, we
risk losing the momentum made towards
saving mothers’ lives, increasing access to
voluntary family planning and achieving
universal sexual and reproductive health
and rights. We also risk falling short of our
shared goal to leave no one behind as we
move forward with the global sustainable
development agenda.

others prefer condoms, which also reduce
the risk of sexually transmitted infections,
including HIV.

Unmet demand for family planning
translates into nearly 60 million
unintended pregnancies annually in
developing countries.

The majority of contraceptives provided
by UNFPA are funded through the
UNFPA Supplies programme, an initiative
focused on increasing access to modern
contraception in the 46 developing
countries with the highest unmet
demand. Donor countries and foundations
together contributed $77.2 million
towards the initiative in 2016. Through
the UNFPA Supplies Programme and the
organization's regular family planning
programmes combined, UNFPA provided
nearly 7 million female condoms and
nearly 268 million male condoms.

UNFPA, the United Nations Population
Fund, is helping respond to the unmet
demand and enabling more women to
exercise their right to decide whether,
when or how often to become pregnant.
Increased access to contraception also
leads to fewer abortions and reduces risks
to women’s health.

Young people make up the largest and fastestgrowing share of the region’s population.
How governments in the region invest in
their health, education and capabilities in
the years ahead will determine whether the
region will reap a demographic dividend.
A demographic dividend is the potential for
economic growth that can result from shifts
in a population’s age structure, when the
share of the working-age population expands
relative to the non-working-age population.
A demographic dividend is linked to a
demographic transition, which begins when
child and infant death rates decrease in
response to increased access to vaccines,
antibiotics, safe water, sanitation and better
nutrition. As couples realize that they do not
need to have as many children to reach their
desired family size, fertility rates then
begin falling.

infections worldwide occur in the region,
which is also home to more than half of all
people living with HIV. An estimated 640
adolescent girls and young women in the
region are infected with HIV every day.
About one in four women in the region has
given birth before age 18. There is a onein-15 chance that a girl in the region will
die from pregnancy or childbirth-related
complications.

Investments in the region are also needed

Key challenges in 2016
In the region, one woman in six uses modern
contraception, contributing to an average
fertility rate of more than five children per
woman. High fertility rates are buoyed in
part by high rates of child marriage and
adolescent pregnancy, which in turn increase
the economic and social vulnerability of
girls and undermine investments in their
education and prevent them from realizing
their full potential. The region has the
world’s highest child marriage rates, with
an average of two of five girls married before
age 18. About 6 per cent of girls give birth
before age 15.
Educational attainment for girls is lower
in West and Central Africa than any other
region in the world. For every 100 boys, there
are only 89 girls enrolled in primary school.
At the secondary level, for every 100 boys
enrolled, there are only 83 girls. Low rates
of educational attainment affects future job
prospects. Jobs for young people are scarce,

Without the usual protection of family
and community, women and adolescent

and safe childbirth are rarely met when
women and adolescents become untethered

Dramatic socioeconomic gains in Asia and
the Pacific, home to almost 60 per cent of the
world’s population, have benefited hundreds
of millions of people. Despite these gains,
hundreds of millions of others still face
formidable development challenges. This
imbalance must be addressed urgently if
countries—and the region as a whole—are
to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals
and the vision for progress that leaves no one
behind.
While many countries have improved access
to sexual and reproductive health services
for their citizens, millions of women still
lack access to family planning, leading to
unintended pregnancies and unsafe abortions.
Of the estimated 114 million pregnancies in
the region in 2016, about 45 million were
unintended.
An estimated 83,700 women and adolescent
girls, mainly in South Asia, continue to die
each year from complications related to
pregnancy and childbirth where there is little
or no access to quality health facilities and
trained personnel, especially midwives.

The majority of young people in and out
of school receive no basic information about
their bodies and reproduction, let alone
comprehensive sexuality education that
would empower them to make responsible
choices and decisions as they mature into
adulthood.

maternal deaths

Child marriage remains widespread, although
efforts by governments and civil society in
some countries to counter harmful practices
and violence against women are gathering
momentum.
All of these challenges are exacerbated in
several countries by pressures to limit the

Asia and the Pacific is the world’s most
disaster-prone region, resulting in additional
vulnerabilities for women and adolescent girls
in their childbearing years. Long-running
conflicts in several countries have also taken
a toll on girls and pregnant women, especially
those who have been displaced or who have
fled to neighboring countries.

The Eastern Europe and Central Asia region
consists of middle-income countries with
significant resources at their disposal and
corresponding levels of public services and
infrastructure. Antenatal care, for example,
is nearly universal, and maternal mortality
rates have fallen by more than half since
the early 1990s, from 66 to 25 deaths per
100,000 births.
But economic inequalities and lack of job
opportunities remain commonplace and
have contributed to migration, both within
countries and within the region, the inability
of many couples to have as many children as
they desire, and wide disparities in access to
services, including sexual and reproductive
health services.
Masked by national data, marginalized and
disadvantaged groups, such as national
minorities, refugees and migrants, young
people and the poor, face particular challenges
in realizing their reproductive rights and
accessing information and services.
Some 17 million women have an unmet
demand for modern contraception in the
region, with two thirds of them relying on

risk of unintended pregnancy and sexually
transmitted infections. In most countries
of South-Eastern Europe and the South
Caucasus, rates of modern contraceptive use
are lower than the average in the world’s least
developed countries.

maternal deaths
averted

For every 1,000 live births in the region
(including Russia), there are 257 abortions,
and every year, 443,000 teenagers give birth,
a rate three times that of Western Europe.
HIV is still on the rise in the region, with an
estimated 190,000 new infections every year,
and sexual transmission rapidly becoming the
predominant factor.

unsafe abortions
prevented

The region has a high incidence of
“secondary infertility”: 12.6 million women
between the ages of 22 and 44 are unable to
have another baby.
Gender inequality still permeates societies
in the region and manifests itself in
discrimination of women, gender-based
violence and harmful practices such as
gender-biased sex selection in parts of
Southeastern Europe and the South Caucasus.

Core Contributions 2

Core resources are the bedrock of UNFPA programmes
that serve women and young people around the world.
Core resources enable long-term planning as well as
rapid response to emerging priorities. Core resources
also enable UNFPA to have a universal presence, even
in fragile contexts, such as in conflict zones
or in refugee situations.

Earmarked contributions in 2016 included $80 million
for the UNFPA Supplies Programme, which expands
access to contraceptives and reproductive health services,
and for the UNFPA Maternal Health Thematic Fund,
which supports midwifery programmes, the Campaign to
End Fistula and other actions to protect the health and
lives of mothers.

UNFPA continued to partner with other United Nations
entities to scale up humanitarian and development
programmes. Earmarked contributions in 2016 included
a total of $109 million through inter-organization
transfers. This consists of agency-to-agency transfers and
funds received as a participant in pooled inter-agency
funding mechanisms.

contributions in US$

Earmarked contributions also included $155 million
to protect the health and lives of more than 11 million
women and adolescents in crises in Afghanistan, Haiti,
the riparian countries of the Lake Chad Basin, Syria and
neighboring countries, Myanmar, South Sudan, Ukraine,
Yemen and about 40 other countries and territories.
While maintaining relationships with traditional
donors in 2016, UNFPA also established or strengthened
partnerships with non-traditional donor governments
and multilateral institutions to ensure sufficient
resources are mobilized to meet the reproductive health
needs of millions of women and adolescents.

Through partnerships in 2016, UNFPA mobilized funding
and in-kind contributions valued at $12.8 million, a 24 per
cent increase over 2015. During the year, 72 agreements
were signed with 50 partners.

In Kenya, UNFPA, other United Nations agencies and
the private sector established the Private Sector Health
Partnership in 2016 to improve health care for women and
children. In Liberia and Niger, an international foundation
has supported UNFPA programmes for adolescent girls.

Some of the partnerships have helped fund UNFPA
programmes around the world, while others have involved
technical assistance or expertise to enable UNFPA to deliver
programmes more effectively or advocate for the rights and
health of women and adolescents.

In Copenhagen, Geneva and elsewhere in 2016, UNFPA
also engaged with parliamentarians to sustain or increase
political support and funding for efforts to protect the
sexual and reproductive health and rights of women
and adolescents.

New partnerships with global companies, foundations and
individuals have amplified UNFPA's ability to support lifesaving initiatives through the Safe Birth Even Here Campaign,
which raises awareness about urgent unmet needs and
vulnerabilities of pregnant women in conflicts and in the
aftermath of natural disasters.

Through other partnerships in 2016, academic institutions
helped UNFPA advance the sustainable development agenda,
and UNFPA engaged with the private sector in corporate
social responsibility programmes and cause-related
marketing initiatives and with information technology
firms to develop data monitoring and collection systems
that boost the effectiveness of UNFPA offices.

Partnerships with the private sector—corporations,
foundations, academic institutions, individuals and other
stakeholders—are critical to achieving the Sustainable
Development Goals.
