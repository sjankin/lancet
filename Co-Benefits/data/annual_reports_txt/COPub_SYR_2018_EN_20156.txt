FOREWORD
Seven years into the conflict, Syria’s catastrophic
conflict has driven almost 12 million people from
their homes and created the largest refugee crisis in
recent history. Approximately 400 000 people have
died, over six million have been displaced inside Syria,
and over five million have left the country altogether.
For the past five years, WHO has classified Syria as
a grade 3 emergency – the highest level according
to WHO’s Emergency Response Framework (ERF). The
duration and severity of the conflict make Syria the
longest major emergency the Organization has had
to tackle since the ERF was introduced in 2013.
The effects of war are long-lasting. Many who survive
chemical attacks, mortar explosions, bombings
and gunshot wounds suffer life-changing injuries
that persist long after the horrifying images have
disappeared from television screens and news
headlines. Prolonged exposure to horrific acts of
violence has left many people susceptible to profound
distress. Children are particularly vulnerable; many of
them have known nothing but conflict, displacement,
distress, hunger and despair.
The sheer numbers of people in need are
overwhelming. A staggering two thirds of the
population are living in extreme poverty. More
than one third have no access to safe water. Rates
of acute malnutrition in children under five years
of age are growing, leading to potentially lifelong
health problems. Over 13 million people require
humanitarian assistance. After years of conflict,
Syria’s economic collapse has led to a descending
spiral where people are increasingly unable to meet
even their most basic needs.
More than half the country’s health care facilities
have been damaged or destroyed. As a result, tens
of thousands of children and adults injured in the
conflict may die unnecessarily or be permanently
disabled. People with chronic diseases may die
because they are unable to obtain basic medicines
that would be readily affordable and available in
normal times. Pregnant women are unable to obtain

emergency obstetric care, putting their lives and
those of their unborn babies at risk. Many people
are forced to travel long distances to reach hospitals;
some die before they can reach help. The breakdown
of water supply networks leaves many people at risk
of potentially deadly diseases such as acute watery
diarrhoea and even cholera.
The year 2017 saw an escalation of the conflict in
north-east Syria, but brought glimmers of hope in
other areas. Ceasefire agreements were reached in
four locations, and thousands of people in besieged
areas were allowed to leave under local agreements.
However, in many other parts of the country, the
situation was as grim as ever. Hundreds of thousands
of people in East Ghouta have remained under siege
since 2013. In late December 2017, some critically
ill patients were allowed to leave East Ghouta for
medical treatment, but for others the authorization
came too late. Over 400 000 people in Syria remain
confined to besieged areas, where they are not
allowed to leave and humanitarian assistance is
rarely permitted to enter.
In late December 2017, the United Nations Security
Council renewed Resolution 2165, which authorizes
cross-border and cross-conflict-line humanitarian
access to Syria for another twelve months. The
new resolution (2393) authorizes UN humanitarian
agencies and their partners to continue to deliver
aid to Syria through border crossings in Iraq, Jordan
and Turkey. Until a political solution is found, WHO’s
main office in Damascus and its hubs in Gaziantep
(Turkey) and Amman (Jordan) will continue to work
with partners to bring humanitarian health assistance
to the people of Syria by all means possible.

1. SITUATION IN 2017
Overview
North-east Syria, much of which was under the control
of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), was
the focus of intense fighting in 2017. Health care
services in all three north-eastern governorates1
were severely disrupted, leaving civilians caught up
in the conflict more vulnerable than ever. Hundreds
of thousands of people were displaced, many of them
more than once, as they sought to escape shifting
battle lines.
Following the start of the offensive to recapture ArRaqqa city from ISIL in June 2017, tens of thousands of
civilians fled. Up to 15 000 civilians remained trapped
in the city in increasingly desperate conditions. The
city was retaken in October 2017, but it had been
utterly devastated. Its main hospital had been
destroyed in an airstrike, and all other hospitals had
been forced to shut down due to military activity in
the area. Thousands of civilians in the neighbouring
governorate of Deir-ez-Zor were displaced following
intensified military operations. In early September,
government forces finally broke ISIL’s three-year
siege on parts of Deir Ez-Zor city, but it too lay in
ruins.
The acute insecurity caused by the fighting meant
that most areas in north-east Syria were off-limits
to humanitarian agencies. Nonetheless, a WHO team
managed to travel to rural areas in Ar-Raqqa and AlHasakeh governorates in July to assess the situation

at first hand. The team’s mission was to identify the
hospitals and health care facilities to which patients
could be referred, and explore ways of setting
up triage mechanisms and evacuation routes for
wounded patients. Alarmingly, it found that there
was only one trauma stabilization point in the whole
of Ar-Raqqa governorate. (Trauma stabilization points
are essential because they give patients rapid access
to life-saving first aid and advanced resuscitation
techniques. Once stabilized, patients can then be
transferred to other medical facilities for treatment.)
By the end of the year access to north-east Syria
had improved but the situation remained extremely
challenging due to the continuing shortage of
functioning health care facilities and the overall
insecurity. As 2017 drew to a close, over 80 000
internally displaced people (IDPs) were living in
makeshift camps and spontaneous settlements
in bitterly cold conditions, with access to only
rudimentary heath care.
In the south of the country, 50 000 people, 80% of
whom were women and children, remained trapped
between Syria and Jordan following a decision by the
Jordanian authorities to close the border. Humanitarian
access to this area remains very limited, and reports
indicate very high rates of diarrhoeal disease among
children and increasing rates of common infections.

The health impact of the crisis
At the end of 2017, more than half the country’s
hospitals, clinics and primary health care (PHC) centres
were only partially functioning or had been damaged
beyond repair. Millions of people had no access to
health care or had to travel long distances to obtain
it. Many hospitals were working at minimum capacity
in extraordinarily difficult conditions, with frequent
electricity cuts, dwindling fuel supplies, broken
equipment and extreme shortages of medicines
and medical staff. International sanctions on Syria
meant that critical spare parts could not be imported
to maintain or repair essential medical equipment.
Patients resorted to sleeping in hospital corridors and
stairwells because there were not enough beds for
them.
Referral services for trauma care, emergency
obstetric care and surgical services were wholly

inadequate. Frequent attacks on hospitals and clinics
severely limited patients’ ability to obtain any kind
of health care. Many patients were too fearful to
make the journey. The collapse of water supplies and
sanitation networks also had a dramatic impact on
health. Growing levels of extreme poverty further
exacerbated the situation, and many people were
forced to choose between paying for health care
or buying other necessities such as food and clean
water.
In 2017, WHO shipped medicines, supplies and
equipment to almost 1300 hospitals and health care
centres throughout Syria, providing a lifeline to many
ill and wounded civilians. Page 36 of this report
describes WHO’s work maintaining the medical
supply chain.

Disease outbreaks
In 2017, measles outbreaks affecting thousands
of children were reported in all 14 governorates of
Syria2. An outbreak of circulating vaccine-derived
poliovirus was detected in March 2017, but rapidly
contained.
WHO, UNICEF, the Syrian Arab Red Crescent (SARC)
and local health authorities conducted several mass
emergency vaccination campaigns to safeguard
Syria’s children. WHO supported two national
measles vaccination campaigns that reached almost
4.8 million children.
Access to north-east Syria was extremely difficult in
the first half of the year. Despite these constraints,
WHO and its partners managed to vaccinate over
315 000 children in rural Deir-ez-Zor against polio
during a national vaccination campaign in March
2017. They also reached over 45 000 children in one
area of conflict-torn Ar-Raqqa governorate. Page 30
of this report describes these vaccination campaigns
in more detail.

Access to besieged and hard-to-reach areas
Leishmaniasis
Cutaneous leishmaniasis, caused by the bite of
certain sandflies, is a growing health problem in
Syria. The disease is associated with population
displacements and poor sanitation. Sandflies are
attracted to crowded areas because they provide a
good source of blood-meals. Overcrowded IDP camps
with rudimentary living conditions and poor sanitary
facilities provide ideal conditions in which sandflies
can breed and prey on humans.
Cutaneous leishmaniasis usually produces disfiguring
ulcers on exposed parts of the body such as the face,
arms and legs. Patients may have a large number
of lesions that can cause serious deformities. WHO
has ordered 100 000 vials of meglumine antimoniate
to treat leishmaniasis and has supported the
establishment of a medical post in Ain Issa camp
(Ar-Raqqa governorate) to treat leishmaniasis
patients. WHO also procured 56 000 insecticidetreated bed nets, an effective preventive measure,
for distribution to households in the most affected
areas, and supported the treatment of around 41 000
leishmaniasis patients.

Over 400 000 people in areas that have been
besieged since 2013 continue to have very little
access to the basic necessities of life. With few
exceptions, civilians cannot leave these areas, and
humanitarian aid workers cannot enter. Another 2.5
million people who live in hard-to-reach areas[1] are
denied regular access to life-saving humanitarian
assistance including health care.
Much of the territory controlled by ISIL in 2016 was
retaken by government forces in 2017, but access
to the remaining areas continues to be extremely
difficult. In 2017, WHO was able to implement limited

vaccination campaigns in these areas after prolonged
negotiations with health authorities, but the situation
remains precarious and unpredictable.
Inter-agency convoys to besieged and hard-toreach areas
The number of humanitarian convoys authorized to
enter besieged and hard-to-reach areas decreased
sharply (from 69 in 2016 to 41 in 2017). Even
when convoys were authorized, government forces
routinely removed life-saving medical items such as
anaesthetics and trauma supplies.

For example, in August 2017, WHO loaded 12 tons of
medicines and medical supplies on an inter-agency
convoy destined for the besieged town of Douma;
this was the first inter-agency convoy authorized to
enter the town in over three months. Government
forces removed ten tons of WHO supplies3, allowing
only two tons to be delivered.

Thousands of children were clinically diagnosed as having measles; 733 cases were confirmed through laboratory tests (compared
with only 85 confirmed cases in 2016).

The UN defines hard-to-reach areas in Syria as those that are not regularly accessible to humanitarian actors due to access
constraints (for example, because there is active conflict in the area).
Supplies removed by military forces are immediately restituted to WHO, which returns them to its warehouses. WHO can then deploy
the supplies to other locations based on needs.

Medical evacuations from besieged areas
Throughout 2017, WHO continued its efforts to secure
life-saving health care for critically ill patients in
besieged areas, especially East Ghouta which has
been under siege since 2013. WHO advocated for
three basic elements to be put in place: (1) sustained
access to all besieged areas; (2) a system to evacuate
critically ill patients; and (3) better protection of
health care facilities and staff inside East Ghouta.
Page 24 of this report describes WHO’s advocacy
efforts on behalf of the people of East Ghouta.

The “Whole of Syria” approach
Under the “Whole of Syria” approach, WHO’s main
office in Damascus and its hubs in Amman (Jordan)
and Gaziantep (Turkey) worked to bring humanitarian
assistance to people in all parts of Syria. WHO’s hub
in Amman worked with partners in south Syria, and
the hub in Gaziantep was responsible for the parts
of north-west Syria that could not be reached from
Damascus. Page 44 of this report describes the work
of each office.

Attacks on health care
WHO defines attacks on health care as any act of
verbal or physical violence that obstructs or threatens
to interfere with the availability and delivery of
health care services during emergencies, and/or with
patients’ access to health care. Attacks can include
bombings, looting, robbery, hijacking, shooting, the
forced closure or military takeover of facilities and
the abduction of health care workers.

These attacks have an immediate impact on hospitals
and the patients they serve. For example, shortly after
the chemical attack on the town of Khan Sheikhoun in
April 2017, the only nearby functioning hospital was
shelled and forced to close temporarily, depriving
civilians caught up in the attack of emergency health
care.
In September 2017, three hospitals and several
ambulances in Idleb governorate were hit by airstrikes
within a few hours of each other, killing one health
care worker and severely injuring another. All three
hospitals suffered significant structural damage and
were forced to close. These facilities, which had been
serving approximately 16 000 people per month,
are no longer functional. Two paramedics in Hama
governorate were killed when two ambulances came

under fire. In December 2017, there were 16 separate
attacks against health care facilities.
WHO has repeatedly and forcefully condemned
attacks on health care. On 19 September 2017,
it released another statement4 condemning the
attacks in Idleb and Hama governorates and calling
on all parties to the conflict to protect civilians and
civilian infrastructure as required under international
humanitarian law.
The dangers faced by humanitarian workers were the
theme of World Humanitarian Day on 19 August 2017
(#NotATarget). Dozens of health care workers in Syria
held “I am not a target” signs to underscore the issue
of attacks on hospitals, clinics and staff.

The targeted destruction of health care facilities in
Syria is unprecedented. In the first half of 2017, there
was a 25% increase in attacks against health care
facilities compared with the same period in 2016. By
the end of the year 123 attacks against health care
facilities and ambulances had been verified. A total
of 88 health care workers were killed or injured in
these attacks.

Delivering vaccines in Syria’s
conflict zones is highly dangerous,
as Hasan Kassar knows all too
well. “At the height of the
conflict in Aleppo, we did our
best to deliver vaccines to
eastern Aleppo. Unfortunately, it
simply wasn’t possible because
the fighting was so intense and
because parties on the ground
wouldn’t let us in. Health care
workers including me came under
fire on more than one occasion.”

work. Ibtisam says that vaccination
services have picked up since the
fighting ceased in Aleppo. “People are

again”, she says. “The whole point is to

Chemical attacks
Chemical attacks on innocent civilians are among the
most extreme examples of the callous disregard for
human suffering that characterizes the Syrian conflict.
In April 2017, at least 83 people died and hundreds
more were injured following a horrific chemical attack
on the town of Khan Sheikoun in Idleb governorate.
Many of the victims were children who suffocated
in their sleep. Shortly after receiving scores of
injured patients, the only functioning hospital in the
area was shelled and forced to close temporarily.
Dozens of victims were transferred to hospitals in
Turkey for emergency treatment, and some of them
later died. The Organization for the Prohibition of
Chemical Weapons subsequently determined that
the victims had been exposed to sarin or a sarin-like
substance. Sarin is banned by international law. It
causes asphyxia, and most people exposed to it die
rapidly and painfully. It was the first time that nerve
agents had been used in Syria since a sarin attack
in 2013 that killed hundreds of people in Ghouta,

near Damascus. Both attacks drew widespread
international condemnation.
WHO immediately deployed stocks of atropine – the
most commonly used antidote to combat the effects
of nerve gases such as sarin – from its warehouse
in Idleb. The only way additional humanitarian aid
could reach Idleb was through the UN’s cross-border
shipments from south-eastern Turkey. WHO and
partners dispatched medical supplies and personal
protective equipment from Turkey and pre-positioned
additional supplies in warehouses on both sides of the
border, ready for release in case of further attacks.
WHO experts in Turkey worked with health care staff
in Idleb to provide round-the-clock guidance on the
diagnosis and treatment of patients. Health care staff
previously trained by WHO on treating the victims
of exposure to chemical weapons were mobilized
to help care for the hundreds of people who fell ill
following the attack.

Leading the health response
WHO continued to lead the health sector5 and oversee
the overall health response in 2017. It convened
regular meetings with health partners to plan,
implement, monitor and adapt operations based on
evolving needs.
On behalf of health partners, WHO led the
development of a health sector recovery plan for east
Aleppo, a medical evacuation plan for East Ghouta,
and a contingency plan to respond to potential
chemical attacks in north-east Syria. WHO also led
health sector planning for the response in north-east
Syria, paving the way with two detailed assessments
of the health situation in the three north-eastern
governorates.

The Organization is facilitating the development of
health sector planning for post-conflict transition
and early recovery in Syria and is working with the
Ministry of Health (MOH) on a strategy to restore
health care services in newly accessible areas in the
country.
WHO speaks on behalf of all of its health sector
partners when advocating at the highest diplomatic
levels for unhindered access to all parts of Syria. It
provides regular updates on the health situation
in besieged areas to the Humanitarian Task Force,
whose mandate is to facilitate access to besieged
areas to deliver humanitarian assistance.

North-east Syria
In 2017, hundreds of thousands of people fled their
homes as government and allied forces began an
offensive to recapture large swathes of territory in
north-east Syria. Thousands of civilians in the besieged
cities of Ar-Raqqa and Deir-ez-Zor were trapped in
desperate conditions, with very little access to food,
water and health care.
In July 2017, despite the insecurity, a WHO team
managed to travel to north-east Syria to assess
health care facilities in Ar-Raqqa and Al-Hasakeh
governorates and explore ways of setting up referral
services and evacuation routes for injured and
critically ill patients. The team found that there were

5

very few health partners operating in the region and
that most health care services had been severely
disrupted. Patients faced travel times of more than
four hours to reach the few health care facilities
that were still functioning. The lack of ambulances
meant that many patients had to be transported to
hospitals by private car, and many of them did not
survive the journey. Security concerns led some NGOs
to position their health care facilities at safe distances
from combat scenes, but this meant that they were
outside the two-hour limit to receive patients for lifesaving treatment. A second assessment carried out by
WHO and partners in September found the situation
in Deir-ez-Zor governorate was equally bleak6.

WHO’s office in Damascus works with 25 health partners. Its hubs in Gaziantep and Amman work with around 70 and 26 partners
respectively.

WHO’s response strategy – developed in collaboration
with its health partners - focused on identifying and
strengthening the health care facilities that were
still functioning, deploying mobile clinics to boost
capacity, and dispatching all available medicines and
supplies to the area. Many people displaced by the
fighting sought refuge in Al-Tabqa, north-west of ArRaqqa city. WHO donated over five tons of medical
equipment, emergency medicines and supplies to AlTabqa’s recently rehabilitated main hospital to help it
handle the huge caseload of IDPs. Since the hospital
reopened its doors in September 2017, it has treated
more than 3400 patients, two thirds of whom were
women and children. WHO supported 10 mobile
teams and 11 static medical points providing health
care services in Ar-Raqqa, and donated another 38
tons of medicines, supplies and equipment to support
health care facilities in the governorate.

WHO dispatched over 25 tons of medical equipment,
medicines and supplies to hospitals in Deir-ezZor governorate, and sent another 133 tons to AlHasakeh governorate to support health care services
for the large numbers of IDPs who had come from ArRaqqa and Deir-ez-Zor. In addition, to prepare for the
possibility of chemical attacks, WHO is pre-positioning
supplies of atropine in hospitals in Qamishli, and has
supported the establishment of decontamination
units in these hospitals.
Although much of north-east Syria is no longer
under the control of ISIL, civilians remain extremely
vulnerable to injuries due to landmines, booby traps
and other explosive remnants of war. Over 80 000
IDPs are living in overcrowded camps where they
are exposed to the harsh winter, with limited access
to drinking water, latrines or individual shelters.
WHO will shortly begin a detailed assessment of the
conditions in the camps and the main health needs
of their inhabitants. Based on the findings of the
assessment, WHO will work with all health partners
to improve the quality and equitable distribution of
health care and referral services, matching services
to needs.

North-west Syria
The intense fighting and airstrikes in the northwest governorate of Idleb damaged many health
care facilities and disrupted referral services and
supply chains. At the same time, IDPs continued to
flood into the governorate to escape the violence in
neighbouring Ar-Raqqa and Deir-ez-Zor. By the end
of September 2017, Idleb was hosting more than
200 000 IDPs. WHO’s hub in Gaziantep sent regular
shipments of medicines and supplies to health care
facilities in Idleb to help them manage the huge
influx of new patients. By the end of 2017, it had
delivered more than 200 tons of supplies to over 100
health care facilities in Idleb governorate, helping
to keep them afloat and allowing them to provide
emergency health care to thousands of patients.
To help address the gaps in health care services,
WHO’s hub in Gaziantep launched a model PHC
network in Idleb governorate. The network links 10
PHC centres (including mobile units), each of which
has different skill levels and capacities. The network
will allow each centre to consult physicians in other
centres and refer patients more easily for treatment.
Effective use of this new resource could result in
as much as a 30% increase in patient consultations
through the network.
To mitigate the acute shortage of health care staff in
north-west Syria, WHO-Gaziantep trained health care
workers on the management of noncommunicable
diseases (NCDs). More than 200 health care staff
in 12 besieged areas and 50 staff in other locations
updated their knowledge of how to diagnose and
treat conditions including diabetes, epilepsy and
asthma.

In 2017, WHO submitted 12 separate requests to the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs, seeking its authorization
to evacuate around 500 critically ill patients (most of
whom had life-threatening diseases such as cancer
and cardiovascular disease) from East Ghouta. All 12
requests went unanswered. In May 2017, WHO and
partners8 submitted a detailed plan to evacuate all

In close collaboration with the Office of the Special
Envoy for Syria and the Humanitarian Task Force,
WHO continued to advocate for the urgent medical
evacuation of patients from East Ghouta. In late
December, the SARC evacuated 29 patients who
were transferred to hospitals in Damascus that had
been identified in the evacuation plan prepared by
WHO earlier in the year.

Responding to disease outbreaks
In Syria, millions of IDPs are living in rudimentary
conditions in overcrowded camps, with very limited
access to clean drinking water and proper sanitation.
Their health has been compromised by poor diet,
extreme stress following exposure to violence, lack
of access to health care, and the loss of homes and
livelihoods. Vaccination rates have plummeted, and
malnutrition is rising across the country. All of these
factors greatly increase the risk of disease outbreaks.

Most of the remaining besieged towns in Syria are
in East Ghouta, an area near Damascus that is home
to around 400 000 people. Although East Ghouta is
one of four ‘de-escalation’ zones that were created in
2017 in an attempt to reduce the violence, it remains
under siege. Humanitarian access to East Ghouta
was severely curtailed throughout 2017, increasing
the suffering of hundreds of thousands of innocent
civilians. According to UNICEF, almost 12% of children
in East Ghouta are suffering from acute malnutrition
– the highest rate recorded anywhere in Syria since
the crisis began7.

Dozens of people in East Ghouta, including several
children, died in 2017 because they were unable to
obtain medical care in time – care that was readily
available in neighbouring Damascus. The continuing
siege meant that WHO was unable to respond to a
measles outbreak that was said to have affected
more than 100 children.
WHO led intensive advocacy efforts to obtain
government approval to deliver humanitarian
supplies to East Ghouta. In July 2017, WHO managed
to send 36 tons of supplies (enough for 150 000
medical treatments) to the towns of Kafr Batna and

Detecting cases of epidemic-prone diseases as soon
as possible is key to preventing their further spread.
WHO’s office in Damascus launched the disease Early
Warning and Response System (EWARS) in Syria in
2012. EWARS is activated whenever an existing
national disease surveillance system is disrupted (for
example, when a country is hit by a natural disaster
or faces a prolonged emergency). This simplified
surveillance system focuses on nine epidemic-prone

https://reliefweb.int/report/syrian-arab-republic/intense-violence-syria-s-east-ghouta-shutters-schools-deprives-children.

WHO’s hub in Gaziantep manages a separate system,
known as EWARN. EWARN covers more than 9.5
million people in 11 governorates, representing
over half of Syria’s territory. It makes effective use
of available resources by integrating existing disease
surveillance systems to ensure the flow of data across
different health system levels. EWARN focuses on 11
priority diseases10.
A total of 1163 health care facilities report to EWARS
in Damascus and another 507 in northern Syria report
to EWARN. Together, these two systems have allowed
WHO to monitor and rapidly respond to disease
outbreaks and alerts across the country.

HOW EWARS
WORKS

Staff in health care facilities are trained to complete
EWARS reporting forms, and are given the tools
they need (e.g., laptop computers, mobile phones,
and standard case definitions for the diseases under
surveillance).

Department of health epidemiologists in each
governorate are responsible for analysing the
weekly data for their governorate and submitting
their analyses to the MOH in Damascus. MOH and
WHO epidemiologists analyse the data from all
governorates and publish the results in a bulletin that
is shared with all partners and posted on WHO’s web
site.

WHO and MOH rapid response teams immediately
investigate any suspected cases of measles, acute
flaccid paralysis and acute watery diarrhoea. All
three of these diseases are highly contagious and
have the potential to spread rapidly among children.
Investigation teams are also dispatched immediately
whenever the weekly rate of the other diseases
under surveillance doubles within three weeks. The
teams collect samples from patients and send them
to the nearest reference laboratory for testing.

If the presence of disease is confirmed, the teams
do contact tracing (i.e., identifying, assessing and
managing people who have been exposed to
the disease to prevent its onward transmission).
Depending on the severity of an outbreak, the MOH
and WHO may decide to organize a nationwide
vaccination campaign to stem its further spread.
Since the beginning of the crisis, EWARS and EWARN
have allowed WHO and partners to rapidly detect and
respond to hepatitis A, typhoid fever, leishmaniasis,
polio and measles across Syria and on the borders
of neighbouring countries. WHO has coordinated the
rapid response to these outbreaks – for example,
through emergency measles and polio vaccination
campaigns – in collaboration with central and local
health authorities, the SARC, and NGO partners. These
efforts have potentially saved thousands of lives and
avoided the spread of disease across borders.

In 2017,
WHO and health
authorities:
•

Investigated 86% of relevant disease
alerts across the country (93% for
EWARS and 79% for EWARN).

•

Trained over 2200 health care workers
on EWARS/N.

•

Expanded the number of health care
facilities reporting to EWARS/N from
1618 (in 2016) to 1670 in 2017.

•

Deployed 70 rapid response teams.

•

Published 52 EWARS bulletins.

Emergency vaccination campaigns
Vaccination remains one of the most cost-effective
public health interventions against diseases such as
measles, which remains a leading cause of death
among young children, and polio, a crippling and
potentially fatal childhood illness. Mass vaccination
campaigns are challenging, since they involve
vaccinating large populations over short periods of
time. They are especially complicated to manage in
settings where access may be compromised or where
populations are constantly on the move.
In Syria, emergency vaccination campaigns are
implemented by the health authorities with the
support of UNICEF, WHO and the SARC. UNICEF is
responsible for procuring vaccines and for media
and communications. WHO is responsible for the
operational aspects of vaccination campaigns:
assessing risks, identifying areas of implementation,
preparing micro-plans, training and supervising
vaccinators,
and
supporting
post-campaign
independent monitoring. The SARC delivers the
vaccines to areas where health authorities have
limited access.

Polio
In March 2017, a new case of polio was confirmed in
Deir-ez-Zor governorate in north-east Syria. Unlike an
earlier outbreak in 2013 that was caused by a wild
strain of the polio virus, this new outbreak was caused
by a virus derived from the polio vaccine itself (see
insert for more information). Between March and midSeptember, 74 cases of circulating vaccine-derived
poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) disease were confirmed
in Syria (71 cases from Deir-ez-Zor governorate
and 3 cases from Raqqa and Homs governorates).
All infected children developed paralytic disease.
In late August, under the International Health
Regulations (2005), WHO’s emergency committee
issued temporary recommendations for the Syrian
Arab Republic as a “state infected with cVDPV2 with
potential risk of international spread”.

WHO worked with local physicians and community
leaders, who were able to convince their communities
that vaccination was the only way to stop the virus
from spreading and paralysing more children.
WHO adopted innovative approaches to increase the
effectiveness and reach of the vaccination campaigns.
The time and place of each campaign were advertised
widely in mosques, IDP camps and local shops. Cards
with information on the vaccination places, dates
and times were bundled into thousands of bags of
pita bread that Syrians picked up every day at their
local bakeries. On street corners, social mobilization
teams handed out information brochures and took
questions from the public. A local ice cream factory
was engaged to assist with the daily freezing and
refreezing of ice packs for vaccine cold boxes. To

maximize individual and community protection,
children were given both inactivated and oral polio
vaccine in the second round of each campaign. No
new cases of cVDPV2 have been reported since midSeptember 2017.
Measles
All governorates reported cases of measles in
2017. To stem the growing number of cases, WHO
supported a national vaccination campaign that
was implemented in two phases. Almost 4.8 million
children were vaccinated against measles in the
course of these two campaigns.
The appendix at the end of this report gives
more details concerning the different vaccination
campaigns implemented in 2017.

Thanks to close collaboration and coordinated
advocacy, WHO, UNICEF, the SARC and other partners
managed to conduct two mass immunization
campaigns in Deir-ez-Zor and Ar-Raqqa governorates.

Vaccine-derived poliovirus
Oral polio vaccine (OPV) contains attenuated
(weakened) vaccine viruses that activate the body’s
immune response. When a child is immunized with
OPV, the vaccine virus replicates in the intestines,
thereby causing immunity to develop in the person
vaccinated. The vaccine virus is also excreted, and the
excreted virus can infect people who have not been
vaccinated. As a result, they too develop protective
immunity (often called herd immunity).
Under ordinary circumstances, when population
vaccine coverage rates are high, cases of paralytic
disease caused by vaccine-derived polioviruses are

extremely rare. However, when vaccination coverage
rates are low, population immunity is also low. In
these settings, the vaccine virus can spread between
under-immunized individuals, and over time it can
mutate into a virulent form that can cause paralytic
disease. Hence, the risk is not so much due to the
vaccine itself; it is due to low vaccination coverage.
The only way to stop the transmission of the virulent
vaccine-derived poliovirus is with an immunization
campaign. This restores high levels of population
immunity and the mutant virus is no longer able to
survive. The outbreak then comes to a close.

EMERGENCY
VACCINATION
CAMPAIGNS

WHO, UNICEF, the SARC and other partners are
working with the MOH to implement mass emergency
vaccination campaigns to respond to outbreaks of
diseases such as polio and measles.
WHO meticulously plans each campaign to ensure
that no detail is overlooked. The aim is always to
vaccinate as many children as possible and stop
the outbreak in its tracks. In the weeks leading up
to each campaign, social mobilizers fan out into the
community to explain how vaccination saves lives
and spread the word about where and when children
can be vaccinated.

Vaccines are sensitive biological products that
must be kept within recommended temperature
ranges from the point of manufacture to the point
of administration. Vaccine potency – its ability to
adequately protect vaccinated patients – can decrease
when the vaccine is exposed to temperatures outside
the recommended range. Once lost, vaccine potency
cannot be regained.

WHO health partners in north-west Syria add
information cards to bread bundles. Each card
shows the date and location of a polio vaccination
campaign, so that parents who pick up bread from
their local bakeries will know where to bring their
children to be vaccinated.

Vaccines are packed in insulated containers before
being transported to the vaccination sites. Heatsensitive monitors are attached to each container,
allowing vaccination teams to evaluate the
cumulative heat exposure of the vaccines. If the
colour changes, this indicates the vaccines have
been exposed to excessive heat and they are
discarded.

Before each vaccination campaign begins, WHO
briefs campaign staff on the target population, the
presence of specific population groups in the area,
and any access constraints. WHO trains vaccination
teams on maintaining the cold chain, safe injection
techniques and how to enter information in the
vaccination reporting forms and compile the data at
the end of each day. Teams are also trained to collect
empty vaccine vials and use safety boxes for syringes
and needles.

WHO trains vaccination teams and volunteers on
safe injection techniques and the importance of
the vaccine cold chain.

The success of each vaccination campaign depends
on the concerted efforts of vaccinators, monitors,
drivers, social mobilizers, community leaders, and
parents who bring their children to be vaccinated.

Since the beginning of the conflict, WHO has focused
on procuring medicines, supplies and equipment
to maintain critical services in Syria. In 2017, WHO
donated trauma care treatments, surgical supplies
and kits, medicines to treat chronic diseases,
equipment for operating theatres and intensive care
units, and prosthetic devices11 to hospitals and health
care facilities. It trained more than 1200 health care
staff on basic PHC, donated medicines and supplies to
support PHC centres, and procured 13 ambulances to
strengthen referral services. WHO rehabilitated six PHC
centres in four governorates12 and fully refurbished
and re-equipped the emergency department at AlMuasat hospital, one of the main referral hospitals in
Damascus. As more areas in Syria become accessible,
WHO will work with health authorities and health
sector partners to support the long and difficult
process of rebuilding the health care system.

Tracking health resources and needs

Maintaining the medical supply chain
The collapse of Syria’s pharmaceutical industry has
had a devastating impact on the lives of ordinary
citizens. Previously, 90% of Syria’s medicines and
medical supplies were produced domestically. Since
the crisis began, the price of medicines has risen
substantially, leaving them beyond the reach of most
people. Maintaining the medical supply chain and
ensuring that hospitals and health care facilities have
uninterrupted supplies of essential medicines is one
of WHO’s core functions.
In 2017, WHO shipped medicines, supplies and
equipment to 1294 hospitals and health care centres
throughout Syria, providing a lifeline to many ill
and wounded civilians. WHO bulk purchases most
medicines and supplies to obtain the best possible
price, and applies strict safeguards to ensure that
medicines and pharmaceutical products meet
acceptable standards. Medicines and emergency
medical kits are stored in WHO warehouses in five

locations13 in Syria, ready to be deployed when needs
arise.
WHO’s supply tracking system monitors the distribution
of medicines, supplies and equipment to health
care facilities. In collaboration with implementing
partners and the MOH, WHO records the end use of
the supplies and the number of beneficiaries reached.
Using warehouse and distribution reports, WHO is
able to verify that supplies reach targeted health care
facilities. Reports of patient consultations from health
care facilities that receive WHO supplies are used to
estimate the number of beneficiaries served.

The availability of up-to-date information on the
status of health care services in Syria is essential
to allow WHO and health partners to analyse the
evolving health situation and direct humanitarian
assistance to where it is most needed. WHO’s

Health Resources Availability Mapping System
(HeRAMS) tracks the status of functionality,
accessibility, infrastructure and staffing levels
of hospitals and health care facilities throughout
Syria.

Water, sanitation and hygiene
Water and sanitation systems gradually deteriorate
during prolonged emergencies. Due to insecurity,
pumps and latrines may be inaccessible and fall into
disrepair. When water is scarce, people cannot wash,
increasing the risk of disease transmission. Without
adequate supplies of clean water, hospitals cannot
sterilize surgical instruments or bathe patients. When
sudden mass displacements leave people without
access to clean water and proper sanitation, many
are forced to collect water from lakes or rivers, where
it is already contaminated, greatly increasing the risk
of waterborne diseases.

In 2017, WHO supported the rehabilitation of water
supply systems in five hospitals in Aleppo, Damascus
and Qamishli. This included drilling and equipping
wells, donating water softeners and additional water
storage space, and installing water purification units
for dialysis machines. In collaboration with UNICEF
and UNHCR, WHO inspected over 90 water storage
tanks in IDP camps in north-east Syria and over 600
groundwater wells used for drinking water supplies
in Aleppo governorate. UNICEF and WHO distributed
water purification tablets to camp residents and host
communities to control the spread of waterborne
diseases. Over 200 000 people had access to clean
water as a result of these efforts.

Malnutrition: a growing problem
Malnutrition among children and infants has risen
sharply as a direct consequence of the crisis. In 2017,
almost 19 000 of the 743 000 children screened
for malnutrition in 586 WHO-supported nutrition
surveillance centres were found to be suffering from
severe acute malnutrition. Over 1000 of these children
had to be referred for in-patient care in stabilization
centres - a 30% increase compared with 2016.

WHO is working closely with the Nutrition sector to
identify and treat malnourished children as early as
possible and refer them for specialized treatment when
needed. WHO is helping to strengthen the national
nutrition surveillance system and has supported the
establishment of 17 nutrition stabilization centres to
treat children with severe acute malnutrition with
medical complications.

Mental health
WHO estimates that one in 30 people in Syria is
suffering from a severe mental health condition, and
at least one is suffering from a mild to moderate
mental health condition as a result of prolonged
exposure to violence. Children, whose parents may
themselves be grappling with the trauma of war,
are especially vulnerable. WHO is supporting the
establishment of a mental health programme in
Syrian schools. The programme aims to train all those
involved in education - teachers, administrators,
nurses, social workers and school counsellors – on
basic mental health and psychosocial interventions
for schoolchildren. WHO plans to train around 500
staff working in 150 schools by the end of 2018.
Approximately 20 000 children will benefit directly
from this programme in 2018, and another 100 000
will benefit indirectly.
The Organization is also supporting the integration
of mental health services into PHC and community

centres across the country. Over 400 health care
facilities in Syria are now providing mental health
and psychosocial support services.
In 2017, WHO’s hub in Gaziantep, Turkey rolled out
the Mental Health Gap Action Programme in northwest Syria and trained more than 250 health care
workers and mental health professionals. Thanks to
this training, they are now able to detect and manage
mental health conditions and provide psychological
first-aid in PHC centres.
Health professionals and humanitarian workers
are themselves not immune to stress and burn-out
following their prolonged exposure to traumatic
events. WHO’s office in Gaziantep has developed
a training course on self-care for health and
humanitarian workers, and has launched a hotline to
provide psychosocial support.

NGOs
WHO works with a network of 83 health NGOs14 that
provide health care services in Syria, especially in
besieged and hard-to-reach locations that remain
off-limits to international agencies. In many areas,
NGO-operated mobile clinics are often the only
health service available. Mobile teams can be
deployed where they are most needed - for example,
to informal settlements and new IDP camps – to
treat people who would otherwise have no access
to any form of health care. Working through its NGO
partners, WHO was able to provide essential health
and nutrition services to over 2.7 million people in
2017.

Working with partners
Other UN agencies
WHO works closely with other UN humanitarian
agencies to plan and implement the health response.
Close coordination with other sectors maximizes the
use of scarce resources, and helps avoid duplication
and overlap. For example, in 2017 WHO worked
closely with UNICEF and UNHCR to monitor the quality
of water in IDP camps and implement immediate

WHO is preparing a strategy outlining how Syria can
make the best possible use of its many skilled health
NGOs and ensure they are all working in a consistent
manner, to the same standards, to deliver health
care to patients. The final strategy - developed in
collaboration with NGOs - will be released in 2018.
WHO has also contracted an outside organization to
assess the relevance, effectiveness, efficiency and
sustainability of its NGO partners15. The assessment
tool was pilot-tested in late 2017, and will be fully
launched in 2018.

mitigation measures when required, thus preventing
the spread of waterborne diseases. Thanks to this
close collaboration, the number of suspected cases
of Hepatitis A, attributable to contaminated water,
inadequate sanitation or poor hygiene practices,
decreased from 28 740 in 2016 to 21 353 in 2017.

WAFAA’S STORY:
ONE YEAR ON

In our annual report for 2016, we told the story of
nine-year old Wafaa, who was badly burned when
her house in east Aleppo was hit by a huge explosion.
Wafaa’s burns were so severe that her eyelids fused
together. Her mouth was so badly injured that she
was unable to close her lips. In early 2017, surgeons
in Damascus carried out preliminary surgery on her
eyes so that she could blink again. Surgery on her
mouth allowed her to swallow without dribbling.
One year on, thanks to generous contributions from
anonymous donors, Wafaa is getting the additional
help she needs. In early January 2018, she and her
mother Duaa travelled to Rome, where over the next
year highly specialized surgeons in the Ospedale
Pediatrico Bambino Gesù will begin the long and
painful process of cosmetic reconstruction.
Thus far, the surgeons in Rome have treated the
contractures on Wafaa’s hand and leg. In February
they will begin reconstructing her lips and eyelids.

The innocence and spirit of this little girl have touched
the lives of everyone who has met her. The president
of the hospital, Mariella Enoc, says “Wafaa’s burn
scars are very visible, but believe me, when you talk
to her, the way she smiles and the way her eyes light
up make you forget her scars completely.”
Wafaa is learning Italian and has made friends with
many of the children at her hospital. She still cries
sometimes when she remembers how other children
in Aleppo were scared of her, not realizing that
beneath the injuries was the playmate they once
knew. And she misses her brothers and sisters terribly.
“When I come back to Syria, I will be beautiful, and
my friends will play with me again”, she says. “And I
will teach them Italian.”

3. THE WHOLE OF
SYRIA APPROACH

Amman, Jordan

Inside Syria

Gaziantep, Turkey

In Damascus, WHO leads the health sector response
and coordinates around 25 health sector partners.
The office has more than 70 staff including public
health specialists, water and sanitation engineers,
logisticians and support staff. Damascus focuses on
the following areas:

WHO’s field office in Gaziantep, a Turkish city near the
Syrian border, has served as an operational hub since
2013. It coordinates around 70 health cluster partners
working in opposition-controlled areas in north-west
Syria. The office has around 20 staff. It collects and
analyses information on health needs and gaps to
support the emergency response, and documents
attacks on health care to support WHO’s advocacy
efforts. Public health officers in Gaziantep provide
support and guidance to NGO partners delivering
health care services in north-west Syria, deliver
medicines and medical supplies to health care facilities
in Syria through cross-border operations, train health
care workers and provide technical support for mass
vaccination campaigns for children in north-west
Syria as well as in besieged and hard-to-reach areas.
In 2017, to mitigate the acute shortage of health care
staff in north-west Syria, WHO-Gaziantep trained over
200 health care staff in besieged areas and another
50 staff in other locations on the management of
NCDs, including diagnosing and treating diabetes,
hypertension, respiratory disease, mental health
disorders and other topics.

1. Leadership: Whole of Syria joint strategic planning,
implementation, monitoring and reporting.
2. Advocacy: advocate with the highest levels of
government for sustained access to all parts of
the country to deliver humanitarian aid.
3. Health diplomacy: support the work of the
International Syria Support Group and the Office
of the Special Envoy for Syria.
4. Information: coordinate the collection, analysis
and dissemination of information on health risks,
needs and gaps across Syria.
5. Resource mobilization: raise funds to support
WHO’s work in Syria.
6. Strategic communication: publish quarterly
donor updates; present WHO’s work in Syria in
international fora.
7. Technical expertise: provide technical advice
to partners; ensure that critical gaps in the
emergency response are filled.
WHO’s four sub-offices in Aleppo, Hasakeh, Homs and
Lattakia work closely with WHO’s network of focal
points throughout the country to monitor the health
response and report back to Damascus on emerging
needs.

A total of 507 health care facilities report to the
disease early warning and response network (EWARN)
managed by Gaziantep. EWARN covers more than
9.5 million people in 11 governorates that together
account for half of Syria’s territory. In 2017, the office
trained more than 700 health care workers on how to
rapidly detect and manage epidemic-prone diseases.

WHO’s hub in Amman hub leads and coordinates
health partners working in opposition-controlled
areas in southern Syria. WHO Amman co-leads and
convenes regular meetings of the health sector
working group comprising 26 UN agencies, national
and international NGOs, donors and local health
authorities. It also leads three working groups (one
on mental health and psychosocial support, one on
community health workers, and one on quality and
remote monitoring).
WHO’s health sector partners in Amman provide
direct support to 45 PHC centres and field hospitals,
with support adapted to meet shifting conflict lines
and according to the availability of funds. A “Health
Services and Population Status” task force has recently
been established to report on the health situation in
southern Syria, based on a core set of 6-7 morbidity
indicators. The task force aims to better document
the health services being supported/provided by
cross-border agencies in southern Syria and provide
justification for these services to be either continued
or handed over to local authorities. The task force
issued its first report in January 2018.
War-related injuries are the first cause of morbidity
and mortality in Syria. Around 30% of wounded
Syrians are permanently disabled as a result of their
injuries. WHO-Amman has partnered with NGOs
to scale up rehabilitation services for injured and
disabled Syrians. NGO partners collaborate with an
extensive network of facilities in both northern and
southern Syria. Facilities supported by these NGOs
receive materials, equipment and training related
to the production of prostheses. As of the end of
2017, NGO partners were providing trauma care
services to approximately 2700 patients and physical
rehabilitation services to nearly 800 patients with
disabilities. In October 2017, the Amman health
sector launched a working group on rehabilitation

with a view to improving the functional outcomes for
people in Syria living with injuries and disabilities.
In 2017, the Amman office delivered essential
medicines and supplies, including surgical supply
kits and anti-venom to treat snake and scorpion
bites, to health care facilities in southern Syria. It
also facilitated cross-border convoys (a total of 60
trucks crossed from Jordan into Syria in 2017). Lastly,
WHO’s technical team in Amman organized a series
of remote and face-to-face trainings on NCD care
and mental health and psychosocial support. Twelve
health coordinators from international NGOs were
trained on managing NCDs in PHC centres and on
remote supervision techniques. Another 14 Syrian
health care professionals were trained on preventing
and managing NCDs.

Acknowledgements
WHO relies almost entirely on voluntary contributions
to fund its humanitarian operations in Syria. It thanks
the many donors who contributed to its work in 2017.
Without their assistance and support, WHO would
have been unable to fulfil its humanitarian mission.
We express our sincere gratitude to the many health
partners in Syria with whom the Organization worked
side by side in 2017.
We salute the bravery and commitment of all WHO
staff in Syria - the drivers, logisticians, pharmacists,
public health officers, EWARS focal points and many
others – who worked to deliver humanitarian aid to
people throughout Syria.
We thank the Syrian Ministry of Health and the
Ministry of Higher Education for their cooperation.
Lastly, we thank Syria’s courageous and selfless
health care workers, the unsung heroes of this
conflict. Working in harrowing conditions, under the
constant threat of bombardment, many of them have
been killed while others put their own lives at risk on
a daily basis to help their fellow Syrians. In 2017, 58
health care staff in Syria were injured and 30 were
killed in the course of duty. Let us remember these
sobering facts as we move into 2018.
