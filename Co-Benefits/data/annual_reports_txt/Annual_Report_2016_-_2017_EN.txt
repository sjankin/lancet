EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
1. This Report summarises key developments in the area of regional cooperation and
integration in the SADC region for the period 2016/17.
2. The political and security situation in the Region has remained peaceful and stable as
Member States continued to adhere to democratic values and practices by holding regular
national democratic elections. This notwithstanding, there have been some challenges in
the Kingdom of Lesotho and the Republic of Madagascar, and continued insecurity caused
by negative forces in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of Congo.
3. Available data indicate that economic performance has continued in a downward trend
in 2016 compounded by shocks emanating from weather related factors and natural
disasters that the region has faced in recent years. Cost-push factors largely driven by
food shortages as a result of drought in some parts of the region in 2015/16 season, have
resulted in most Member States recording rising inflation in 2016. These climate change
factors (droughts and floods), in addition to declining commodity prices, have largely
contributed to the slowdown in real GDP growth, which averaged 2.6 per cent in 2016
compared to 3.3 per cent recorded in 2015. Favourable weather conditions experienced
in 2016/17 will result in improved agricultural production leading to improved food supply,
thus containing the price pressures in the region.
4. In terms of implementation of regional programmes, based on its mandate, which is
mainly strategic planning; coordination and harmonisation of policies and strategies;
monitoring and evaluation; resource mobilisation; and research, the Secretariat had
planned for 304 outputs in its Corporate Plan for 2016/17 to contribute towards the
objectives of the RISDP and SIPO. Of these outputs, 243 (80 per cent) were fully achieved
and 61 (20 per cent) were not completed. The outputs which were not completed have
been re-programmed in the Operational Plans for 2017/18, where resources are available.
5. An overview of key outputs achieved or on-going are summarised below according the
priority areas of the Revised RISDP.
Industrial Development and Market Integration
6. Implementation of major milestones for the Industrialisation Strategy and Roadmap is ongoing, and the Action Plan for the Strategy was approved in March 2017.
7. The mineral and pharmaceutical sectors were profiled and potential areas for developing
regional value chains were identified. Further work is required in the profiling of both
sectors to, among others, undertake detailed feasibility studies on each of the identified
value chains and develop bankable projects.
8. The SADC Integrated Regional Electronic Settlement System (SIRESS), which was
initially launched in four Member States of the Common Monetary Area has been rolled
out to 14 Member States. Efforts are on-going to ensure the remaining Member State
(Madagascar) joins SIRESS soon.
9. Ten (10) Member States (Madagascar, Mauritius, Mozambique, Tanzania, Zambia and
SACU Member States) have completed the implementation of Category C tariff phase
down.
7

-----------------------Page 7 End-----------------------

10. Work on the operationalisation of the SADC Regional Development Fund is on-going. The
Agreement on the Operationalisation of the SADC Regional Development Fund was
finalised, and has been signed by seven Member States.
11. The peer review mechanism continued to operate and the Peer Review Panel met in July
2017 to consider the reports for DRC, Namibia and Zimbabwe.
Infrastructure Support for Regional Integration
12. Ten (10) additional projects were received through the SADC PPDF online application
system (www.sadcppdf.org), from April 2016 to 25 January 2017.
13. The SADC-PIDA Acceleration Programme on the Beira and North-South Corridors was
launched in June 2016.
14. A Resolution on Cyber Security was adopted in October 2016 which urges Member States
to accelerate the domestication of all the SADC Harmonised Model Laws and to
operationalise their Computer Incidence Response Teams (CIRTs) by December 2018.
15. Overall access to electricity in the Region increased from 36% in September 2015 to about
45% by the end March of 2017. As at the end of May 2017, fourteen (14) SADC Member
States had introduced some kind of regulatory oversight in the form of energy or electricity
regulatory authorities.
16. The process of domesticating the One-Stop-Border Post (OSBP) Source Book 2 nd Edition
was launched. The toolkit is to guide policy-makers, trade and transport practitioners. It
will also assist the Secretariat in formulating regional policies and programmes on OSBPs.
17. As part of Transboundary Water Resources Management, a number of initiatives are
underway in the various River Basins, including the signing of the Pungwe River Basin
Bilateral Cooperation Agreement by Mozambique and Zimbabwe and discussions
between the Government of Angola and Namibia to establish a Kunene Water
Commission (KUNECOM).
18. The capacity of the SADC Climate Services Centre (CSC) to generate quality, reliable
climate information has been improved through the construction of a Laboratory, the
provision of equipment, and connecting the Centre to the global meteorological system.
Peace and Security Cooperation
19. Comprehensive (technical, administrative, logistical, and financial) support was provided
to regional initiatives, including TROIKA Missions, to the DRC (2), Republic of Madagascar
(1) and the Kingdom of Lesotho (3), contributing to relative stability to the respective
Member States.
20. To promote democratic institutions and practices in the region, the draft Curriculum,
Training Manual and Handbook for SADC Election Observers have been completed and
have gone through pre-validation processes of the SADC Electoral Advisory Council.

10

-----------------------Page 10 End-----------------------

28. In the area of development cooperation and resource mobilization, development
partners that have continued to contribute considerable resources to the implementation
of SADC programmes and projects include: the European Union through the European
Development Fund, AfDB, World Bank, Commonwealth, World Health Organization, Food
and Agriculture Organization, USAID, UN Agencies and the Global Fund. Regional
institutions such as the Southern Africa Trust have continued to extend their support to
SADC. Significant support was also received from individual countries such as Germany,
and consultations are on-going with China and Japan for financial and technical support.
29. Risk Management continues to be an important pillar of good governance for the
Secretariat. Directorates and Units continue to review and update their risk profiles to
ensure that impacts and likelihood of risks are proactively mitigated, while potential
opportunities are explored further where possible. A Business Continuity Management
Plan is being developed to ensure seamless transition and continuity during disasters,
emergencies or any unexpected interruptions to the operations of the Secretariat.
30. Financial Management framework: Results for the 2016/17 financial year show: an
operating surplus of US$ 6.1 million (compared to US$11.8 million in 2015/16) and total
assets under the control of SADC Secretariat of US$ 97.5 million (compared to US$101.1
million in 2015/16); decreasing contributions from Member States (27%) and declining
grants (37%).
31. The overall utilisation of the budget for programmes and corporate services in 2016/17
was 64%, and reflects 81% and 53% for contributions from Member States and ICPs,
respectively.
32. The effective and full implementation of regional SADC programmes and projects
continues to be affected by a number of challenges in areas such as planning and
programming; monitoring, evaluation and reporting; project management; financial and
human resources; and computerization and ICT systems. In order to address these
challenges, a number of reforms to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the SADC
Secretariat’s operation have been undertaken. Key measures taken include:
strengthening the operationalisation of the planning, monitoring and evaluation functions;
developing the SADC Project Management System to improve implementation, efficiency
and absorption capacity for the entire project management cycle; reviewing and approval
of the SADC organization structure; and automating ICT systems.
33. To continue building on the above reforms, key recommendations for the short to
medium term include: continued improvement of planning and programming, monitoring,
evaluation and reporting processes to ensure that they are in line with existing capacity
and availability of financial and human resources; continued strengthening of negotiations
between parties to ensure that projects and programme estimates are aligned to SADC
priorities and fiscal year, and that funds are disbursed on time; improving recruitment
frameworks to ensure that vacant positions are promptly filled; and ensuring that the
Secretariat communicates to SADC audiences in ways that are relevant and as engaging
as possible.

2.0
POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS IN THE SADC REGION FOR 20152016 AND OUTLOOK FOR 2016-2017
2.1

POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS

2.1.1

Conflict Prevention Management and Resolution

1. The political and security situation in the Region has remained peaceful and stable as
Member States continued to adhere to democratic values and practices by holding regular
national democratic elections. This notwithstanding, there have been some challenges in
the Kingdom of Lesotho and the Republic of Madagascar, and continued insecurity caused
by negative forces in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
The Democratic Republic of the Congo
2. The political situation in the DRC remained volatile, requiring deployment during the period
under review, of regular follow-up missions and continued expression of SADC support to
the DRC. These follow-up missions included an Organ Troika Ministerial Assessment
Mission to the DRC from 10 to 13 October 2016, a Secretariat Technical Assessment
Mission in February 2017, Follow-up Mission of the Ministerial Committee of the Organ
Troika (MCO-T) from 19 to 21 April 2017 with the objective of assessing the political and
security developments in the DRC, and the on-going efforts related to peace and political
stability in the country. There has been an escalation of violence and insecurity in the
Kasai Provinces and in eastern DRC, where negative forces continue to wage an
asymmetric war against the Government and United Nations Stabilisation Mission in the
12

-----------------------Page 12 End-----------------------

DRC (MONUSCO) forces. The DRC stakeholders are yet to finalize the Specific
Arrangements for the Implementation of the 31st December 2016 Political Agreement.
The Kingdom of Lesotho
3. At its meeting held in Lozitha, Kingdom of Swaziland on 30-31 August 2016, Summit,
among others decided to deploy the Oversight Committee (OC) on the Kingdom of
Lesotho to serve as an early warning mechanism, and lend assistance to the
implementation of the Constitutional and Security Sector Reforms, where necessary. The
OC carried out deployments to the Kingdom of Lesotho between November 2016 and
June 2017. The OC has been working closely with the SADC Facilitator and
recommended that SADC must maintain involvement in the reforms process in Lesotho,
as the process is still at the preparatory stage. With the inauguration of the new
Government led by Dr. Thomas Thabane, it is expected that the impetus for the
implementation of the reforms process will be achieved through the convening of a multistakeholder national political dialogue.
The Republic of Madagascar
4. Madagascar has returned to constitutional normalcy with the holding of the 2013
Presidential and Legislative elections, within the framework of the implementation of the
SADC Roadmap. In his investiture speech, H.E. President Rajaonarimampianina
undertook to improve the country’s political, economic, social and security situation but
unfortunately, the situation remains fragile. Maintaining peace and stability in Madagascar
remains a top priority. This must be predicated upon a clear agenda of national
reconciliation within the framework of the Roadmap. The political, economic, social and
security situation in Madagascar remains very fragile as the country still has to contend
with political instability and insecurity. Other challenges include, poverty,
underdevelopment, natural disasters and social tensions. Through the Special Envoy,
SADC is being called upon to again play a more active and leading role in assisting
Madagascar to consolidate peace and stability, mobilize international support for postconflict reconstruction and development to heal the negative impact of the past, and fully
address the challenge of national reconciliation, as provided for in the Roadmap.
2.1.2

Strengthening Regional Collective Defence and Security

5. In line with the African Standby Force (ASF) objective of promoting Peace, Security and
Stability in Africa, the SADC Standby Force (SSF) is expected to be on the African Standby
Force Roster from 1 January to 30 June 2019. A Concept Paper on the implications and
requirements related to fulfilling SADC’s obligations on the African Standby Force Roster
during this period was validated by Member States and endorsed by the DSC at its
meeting in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania on 19 May 2017. As such, the SSF has continued to
strengthen and enhance operational readiness by undertaking a number of activities which
include, among others, striving to put relevant structures like the Regional Movement
Coordination Centre and Joint Operations Centre (RMCC/JOC); Command, Control and
Communication Information System (C3IS); Deployable Headquarters; Regional Logistics
Depot and Policy/Legal Frame Work for smooth deployment.
6. At the same time, as force preparation, SSF has planned for Regional Exercises to take
place both in 2017 and 2018. Some of the scheduled Exercises are the SADC Air
Forces/Arms/Wings Interoperability Humanitarian Aid (HA), Joint Exercise Blue - Kunene
13

-----------------------Page 13 End-----------------------

to be held in Namibia; Medical Health Services Exercise Morwalela to be held in
Botswana, Special Forces Exercise Matumbawe to be held in the United Republic of
Tanzania and the SSF Command Post Exercise to be held in Malawi.
2.1.3

Consolidating Democratic Institutions in the Region

7. SADC Member States have continued to hold regular democratic elections. This reflects
the region’s commitment to democratic principles and practices. Between August 2016
and July 2017, elections were held in the Republic of Zambia, the Republic of Seychelles
and the Kingdom of Lesotho. In the Republic of Zambia, General Elections were held on
11 August 2016 and H.E. Edgar C. Lungu and the Patriotic Front (PF) party won the
elections. In the Republic of the Seychelles the main opposition coalition parties, the
Linyon Demokratik Seselwa (LDS) won the elections.
8. On 16 October 2016, the President of the Seychelles, H.E. James Michel resigned from
office and was replaced by his former Deputy President, H.E. Danny Faure, to serve the
rest of the four-year term of the Presidency as provided for by the Constitution of the
Republic of the Seychelles. The Kingdom of Lesotho held Snap Elections on 3 June 2017
and The Right Honourable Dr Thomas Thabane and the All Basotho Convention (ABC)
party won the elections. This enabled them to form a government with three other parties,
as there was no party with an outright majority of seats. In all three elections the 2015
Revised Principles and Guidelines Governing Democratic Elections were used by the
SADC Election Observer Missions (SEOM) deployed to the Member States. Similarly, in
all three Member States, the SEOMs received advisory services on electoral, democracy
and good governance matters from the SADC Electoral Advisory Council (SEAC).
9. A number of Pre-election assessment missions to Member States holding elections were
undertaken by the SEAC, to ascertain their levels of preparedness and readiness to hold
elections. Post-election assessment missions were also undertaken to determine the
extent to which they had complied with the recommendations of the SEOM reports in
conformity with the revised SADC Principles and Guidelines Governing Democratic
Elections. The forecast for 2017/18 indicates that Member States will continue to embrace
democratic practices, uphold the principles of electoral integrity, good governance and
continue to strengthen their democratic institutions.
2.2

ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS

2.2.1

Global Economic Background

2.2.1.1 Economic Activity
10. Binding structural impediments continue to hold back a stronger global economic
recovery. Persistent structural problems, such as low productivity growth and high income
inequality; and increasing pressures for inward-looking policies in advanced economies,
threaten global economic integration and the cooperative global economic order that has
served the world economy well, especially emerging markets and developing economies.
11. According to the IMF World Economic Outlook Report of April 2017, global growth in 2016
slowed down to 3.1 per cent from 3.4 per cent in 2015. Emerging markets and developing
economies still accounted for the largest part of the world growth, although performance
14

-----------------------Page 14 End-----------------------

across countries continued to be uneven and generally weaker compared to the past two
decades (see Table 1).

12. Growth in the United States was 1.6 per cent in 2016, down from 2.6 per cent recorded in
2015, largely driven by the uncertainties around the elections. However, growth picked up
in the last quarter of 2016 reflecting the assumed fiscal policy easing and an increase in
confidence, especially after the November elections.
13. Recovery in the Euro area was not satisfactory largely because of slow growth in Spain
and Italy. Real GDP growth slowed down from 2.0 per cent in 2015 to 1.7 per cent in 2016.
14. Growth in the emerging markets and developing economies was mixed. Despite continued
policy support, economic activity in China slowed down marginally from 6.9 per cent in
2015 to 6.7 per cent in 2016. Similarly, economic activity in India slowed down from 7.9
per cent in 2015 to 6.8 per cent in 2016, largely because of the impact of the currency
exchange initiative. Brazil continued to be mired in a deep recession with real GDP
declining by 3.8 per cent and 3.6 per cent in 2015 and 2016, respectively.
15. Economic activity in Sub-Saharan Africa fell sharply with output increasing by only 1.4 per
cent in 2016, compared to a growth of 3.4 per cent recorded in 2015. This was largely a
result of low commodity prices, structural challenges such as power shortages and climate
change related factors.
2.2.1.2 Developments in Commodity Prices
16. Commodity prices largely remained weak for the better part of 2016 with the IMF all
primary commodity index declining by 10 per cent from 111 in 2015 to 100 in 2016 (see
Figure 1). The weak prices were in part due to concerns about the sluggish resilience of
global demand and investors’ loss of appetite for commodity investments. Declines in oil
prices remained substantial, falling from an average of US$51 per barrel in 2015 to an
average of US$43 dollars per barrel in 2016. However, oil prices started to pick up in
August 2016, in part due to the agreement by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting
Countries (OPEC) and other producers to cut oil production. Stronger activity and
expectations of more robust future global demand also contributed to strengthening oil
prices.

17. Non-fuel prices weakened with the indices for industrial materials, metals and agricultural
raw materials, declining by 5 per cent, 6 per cent and 6 per cent from 124, 127 and 120 in
2015 to 117, 120 and 113 in 2016, respectively. However, there were marginal
improvements in food prices with food index increasing by 2 per cent from 141 in 2015 to
144 in 2016.
2.2.2

Regional Economic Performance

2.2.2.1 Overview
18. Available data provided by Member States in March 2017 and from the IMF World
Economic Outlook database (April 2017) indicate that the downward trend in economic
growth since the global economic crisis in 2009, continued in 2016 compounded further
by shocks emanating from weather related factors and natural disasters the region faced
in recent years. Cost-push factors largely driven by food shortages as a result of drought
in some parts of the region in 2015/16 season, have resulted in most Member States
recording rising inflation in 2016. Fiscal space has vanished and public debt is rising.
External positions of most of the Member States continue to deteriorate and exchange
rates weakened. This outcome is largely a result of two factors beyond the control of
Member States.
19. Firstly, climate change factors affected the region with some of the Member States
experiencing drought while others experiencing floods. The immediate impact of these
disasters has been on the fiscal account as Member States increased expenditure for
relief and humanitarian purposes; and rehabilitation of damaged infrastructure. Secondly,
weak commodity prices have affected most Member States, resulting in low revenues at
a time when demand for resources for humanitarian and relief purposes was high.

-----------------------Page 16 End-----------------------

2.2.2.2 Real GDP
20. Real GDP continued to slowdown averaging 2.6 per cent in 2016 compared to 3.3 per
cent recorded in 2015 (see Figure 2). However, if average population growth of the region
of 2.3 per cent is factored in, the region barely grew in 2016. Only Tanzania recorded real
GDP growth rates above the regional target of 7 per cent. Climate change factors
(droughts and floods) in addition to declining commodity prices have largely contributed
to the slowdown in real GDP growth.

21. Consequently, per capita GDP declined by 1.5 per cent in 2016. However, this was a
modest decline compared to a decline of 9.4 per cent in 2015. Only five Member States:
Botswana, DRC, Mauritius, Seychelles and Tanzania, recorded positive growth in per
capita GDP in 2016 compared to only two Member States: DRC and Malawi, in 2015.
2.2.2.3 Inflation
22. Cost-push factors largely driven by weakening currencies and food shortages as a result
of drought in some parts of the region in 2015/16 season, have resulted in most Member
States recording rising inflation in 2016. Provisional figures indicate that the region
recorded an average inflation rate of 10.3 per cent in 2016 compared to an average of 5.8
per cent in 2015. In 2015 all Member States, except for Angola, Madagascar, Malawi and
Zambia, met the regional inflation target range of 3-7 per cent. In 2016, only half of the
Member States: Botswana, Lesotho, Madagascar, Mauritius, Seychelles, South Africa and
Tanzania, met the regional inflation target range of 3-7 per cent.
23. Zimbabwe remained in a deflationary state (-2.4 per cent in 2015 and -1.5 per cent in
2016) as a result of low aggregate demand; and cheaper imported products compared to
locally produced goods.

17

-----------------------Page 17 End-----------------------

2.2.2.4 National Savings and Investments
24. Both average total investments and gross national savings have been on the decline since
2013. The region recorded total investments of 21.5 per cent of GDP in 2015, a decline
from 23.8 per cent of GDP in 2014. Despite the decline in average terms, Madagascar,
Mauritius and Swaziland recorded increases in total investment in 2015. Only three
Member States: Seychelles, Tanzania and Zambia, managed to achieve the regional
target of 30 per cent of GDP for investment (see Figure 3).
25. On the savings side, the region recorded an average gross national savings of 14.7 per
cent of GDP in 2015. This was lower than the gross national savings of 18.4 per cent of
GDP realised in 2014. Only Botswana, Lesotho and Zambia achieved the regional target
of 30 per cent of GDP in 2015. Botswana, Lesotho and Zambia, were also the only
Member States that achieved the regional target of 30 per cent in 2014.

2.2.2.5 Fiscal Sector
26. Poor economic performance has resulted in low government revenues, in turn affecting
fiscal balance positions in the face of increased expenditures to support relief and
humanitarian efforts. Government revenue declined from an average of 26.7 per cent of
GDP in 2015 to an average of 24.9 per cent of GDP in 2016. However, government
expenditure remained almost unchanged at 30.5 per cent of GDP in 2015 and 30.1 per
cent of GDP in 2016.
27. Fiscal space for a majority of Member States has been exhausted in 2016. The region is
estimated to have recorded a fiscal deficit of 4.7 per cent of GDP in 2016 compared to a
deficit of 3.7 per cent of GDP in 2015. Only four Member States (DRC, Lesotho, Mauritius
and Seychelles) met the regional fiscal deficit target of 3 per cent of GDP in 2016
18

-----------------------Page 18 End-----------------------

compared to five Member States (Angola, Botswana, DRC, Madagascar and Seychelles)
in 2015.
28. Consequently, public debt has risen almost across all Member States. The region is
estimated to have recorded a public debt of 49.5 per cent of GDP in 2016 compared to
45.1 per cent of GDP recorded in 2015. All Member States, except for Mauritius,
Mozambique and Seychelles met the regional target of public debt of 60 per cent of GDP,
both in 2015 and 2016 (see Figure 4).

2.2.2.6 External Sector
29. Performance of the external sector in general remained unsatisfactory in 2016 on account
of low commodity prices. Export volumes improved slightly by 2.9 per cent in 2016
compared to a growth of 1.4 per cent in 2015. Import volumes declined by 0.6 per cent in
2016 compared to a decline of 0.3 per cent recorded in 2015.
30. In value terms, the Report on Recent Economic Developments in SADC produced by the
Bank of Mauritius for the Committee of Central Bank Governors (CCBG) indicates that
SADC goods exports decreased by 7.8 per cent from US$165.4 billion in 2015 to
US$152.5 billion in 2016. Exports by South Africa and Angola accounted for the two
largest share of these exports, with 49 per cent and 18 per cent of total SADC exports in
2016, respectively. The individual shares of all other Member States were in the range of
1-7 per cent of total SADC exports. Intra-SADC exports amounted to US$35.8 billion in
2016, representing 23.5 per cent of total exports of the SADC region, higher than 22.8 per
cent in 2015.
31. Values for total goods imports decreased by 13.1 per cent, from US$189.6 billion in 2015
to US$164.8 billion in 2016. South Africa and Angola imports had a share of 45 per cent
19

-----------------------Page 19 End-----------------------

and 17 per cent of total SADC imports, respectively, in 2016. The individual shares of all
other Member States were in the range of 1-6 per cent of total SADC imports. Intra-SADC
imports amounted to US$30.8 billion, representing 18.7 per cent of total imports of the
SADC region, slightly higher than 17.8 per cent in 2015. Consequently, intra-SADC trade
progressed mildly from 20.1 per cent in 2015 to 21.0 per cent in 2016. Compared to
Europe and Asia where intra-trade exceeds 60 per cent, the current level of intra-SADC
trade remains inadequate, holding back significantly the regional integration process. In
this context, the SADC Industrialisation Strategy and Roadmap 2015-2063, launched in
April 2015, comes at an opportune time for Member States to redress the situation.
32. Consequently, current account deficit for the region averaged 7.5 per cent of GDP in 2016
compared to an average of 7.6 per cent of GDP in 2015. All Member States, except for
Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia and Seychelles, recorded current account deficits within
the regional target of 9 per cent of GDP in 2016. In 2015 all Member States, except for
Angola, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia and Seychelles, recorded current account deficits
within the regional target (see Figure 5).

33. In terms of foreign exchange reserves, SADC average import cover improved slightly from
5.1 months of imports in 2015 to 5.2 months of imports in 2016. Botswana had the largest
level of international reserves in SADC, representing an import cover of 17.5 months,
followed by Angola with 10.5 months and Mauritius with 9.3 months. The other Member
States did not meet the criterion of 6 months of import cover, with some of them even
falling short of the IMF benchmark of 3 months of import cover.

2.2.2.7 Business Environment
34. Data from the World Bank Ease of Doing Business 2016-17 indicate that the SADC region
is making progress in improving the business environment and its competitiveness in
general, although performance during the year under review was mixed, a reflection of the
macroeconomic background. Over half of the Member States slipped in ranking, while
some showed steady improvements in the ease of doing business ranking.
35. Performance with regard to ease of doing business indicate that Botswana, Lesotho,
Malawi, Seychelles and Tanzania improved in their ranking with Lesotho, Malawi and
Tanzania moving up by fourteen, eight and seven positions, respectively. On the other
hand, Mauritius slipped by seventeen positions from 32 in 2015/16, while Swaziland and
Zimbabwe slipped by six positions from 105 and 155 in 2015/16, respectively.
Nonetheless, Botswana, Lesotho, Mauritius, Seychelles, South Africa and Zambia remain
the only Member States in the region ranked within the first 100 bracket (see Figure 6).

36. The picture with regard to improving the business environment is the same if one
considers the World Economic Forum Global Competitiveness Index (GCI), although the
GCI indicates fair improvements in some respects (see Figure 7). The GCI measures the
competitiveness of an economy by considering all factors from basic factors that enable it
to be competitive to factors that make it efficient and innovative.

37. Seven Member States improved in the GCI ranking, namely: Botswana, Madagascar,
Malawi, Mauritius, Namibia, South Africa and Tanzania. Two Member States (Botswana
and Tanzania) demonstrated exceptional improvements by moving up seven and four
positions from 71 and 120 in 2015-16 to 64 and 116 in 2016/17, respectively. However,
Lesotho and Zambia slipped in the ranking by seven and twenty-two positions from 96
and 113 in 2015-16 to 118 and 113 in 2016/17, respectively.
38. Mauritius, South Africa and Botswana remain the top performers in the region. Increased
uptake of ICTs, especially higher Internet bandwidth and improvements in innovation,
continue to establish South Africa as the region’s most innovative economy. South Africa
also hosts the continent’s most efficient financial market and benefits from a sound goods
market, which is driven by strong domestic competition and an efficient transport
infrastructure. On the other hand, Mauritius halted its fall which occurred in 2015/16 as a
result of declines in the efficiency of labour and the financial markets. Mauritius moved up
by one position from 46 in 2015/16 to 45 in 2016/17.
2.3

PROSPECTS FOR 2017 AND THE MEDIUM-TERM
39. The medium term economic prospects are being shaped by a number of factors taking
centre stage globally and regionally. The momentum gained by the world economy in the
fourth quarter of 2016 is expected to persist on the back of buoyant financial markets and
a long awaited cyclical recovery in manufacturing and trade underway. Activity is projected
to pick up markedly in emerging markets and developing economies because conditions
in commodity exporters experiencing macroeconomic strains are gradually expected to
improve, supported by the partial recovery in commodity prices, while growth is projected
to remain strong in China and many other commodity importers. But risks on the downside
remain, including low productivity growth and high income inequality; and pressures in the
developed countries for inward looking policies.
22

-----------------------Page 22 End-----------------------

40. Improvements in the commodity markets are expected to support growth prospects in the
short to medium term. Prices for most industrial commodities are expected to strengthen
further, a trend noticed in the first quarter of 2017, while global agricultural prices are likely
to remain stable. Crude oil prices are forecast to rise to an average of $55 per barrel in
2017 from $43 per barrel in 2016, a reflection of balancing forces: upward pressure on
prices from production cuts agreed by OPEC and non-OPEC producing countries; and
downward pressure from persistently high stocks, supported by the faster-than-expected
rebound of the USA shale oil industry. Metals prices are projected to increase by 16
percent as a result of strong demand in China and various supply constraints, including
labour strikes and contractual disputes in the case of copper and environmental and export
policies for nickel. Agricultural commodity prices, which gained in the first quarter of 2017,
are anticipated to remain broadly stable in 2017, with moderate increases in oils and meals
and raw materials offset by declines in grains and beverages.
41. At regional level, the favourable weather conditions experienced in most parts in 2016/17
will result in improved agricultural production. This will result in improved food supply, thus
containing the price pressures in the region. It will also ensure stable supply of agro-related
raw materials for agro-processing industry. However, this expected improvement is
against a number of nature and climate-related factors such as the attack by Fall Army
Worms, El Nino effects and earthquakes.
42. As of mid‐February 2017, almost 223,000 hectares had been affected by Fall Army Worms
in Zambia, of which almost 90,000 hectares were maize; 17,000 hectares in Malawi; 50
000 hectares of maize and millet in Namibia; and up to 130,000 hectares in Zimbabwe.
Mozambique was hit by Cyclone Dineo, which affected 551,000 people and led to the loss
of 7 lives; totally and partially destroyed more than 33,000 hectares and 71,294 houses,
respectively; and damaged 389 Government offices, 70 health facilities and 1,687
classrooms. Zimbabwe has been affected by flooding which has claimed the lives of 246
people; left almost 2,000 people homeless; and damaged 2,579 homesteads and 74
schools. Madagascar was affected by Cyclone Enawo which led to floods in the northeastern part of the country causing 51 deaths, 21 disappearances, injury to some 238
people, 328,972 people homeless, 37,988 houses destroyed; and adding some 78,895
people to the already displaced population of 153,561. Namibia experienced floods due
to the heavy rains in the northern parts of the country, namely: Omusati, Oshana,
Ohangwena and Zambezi regions. More than 20 schools in the Omusati region alone
were closed due to the floods. Tanzania was also affected by an earthquake while
Seychelles was affected by a hurricane in one of the Outer Islands.
43. In view of the above, world output growth is projected at 3.5 per cent in 2017, rising further
to 3.6 per cent in 2018. Growth in advanced economies in 2017 is projected to improve
marginally to 2.0 per cent in 2017, and remaining at the same level in 2018. USA will
continue to champion this growth, growing by 2.3 per cent in 2017 and 2.5 per cent in
2018. Growth in the Euro area is expected to remain subdued at 1.7 per cent in 2017 and
1.6 per cent in 2018.
44. Emerging markets and developing economies will continue to uplift global growth with their
growth as a whole improving from 4.1 per cent in 2016 to 4.8 per cent in 2018. Brazil and
Russia are projected to grow marginally in the medium term compared to the negative
growths recorded in the past three years. Growth in the SSA is projected to improve by
23

-----------------------Page 23 End-----------------------

1.2 percentage points from 1.4 per cent in 2016 to 2.6 per cent in 2017, and rising further
to 3.5 per cent in 2018.
45. Economic growth in the SADC region is expected to increase by an average of 3.3 per
cent in 2017, an improvement from 2.6 per cent in 2016. None of the Member States is
expected to achieve the regional target of 7 per cent growth in real GDP in 2017. However,
growth in Tanzania is expected to be strong at just below 7 per cent. Per capita GDP for
the region is expected to improve modestly from US$3,602 in 2016 to US$3,801 in 2017.
46. Savings at regional level are projected at 15.0 per cent of GDP in 2017, an improvement
from14.4 per cent of GDP recorded in 2016. Only Botswana and Zambia are expected to
record gross national savings above the regional target of 30 per cent of GDP. As for total
investment, the region is expected to record a slight improvement from 20.6 per cent of
GDP in 2016 to 21.5 per cent of GDP in 2017, with only Botswana, Mozambique and
Zambia expected to record total investments of above 30 per cent of GDP in 2017.
47. Regional inflation is projected to slow down to 8.9 per cent in 2017 from 10.3 per cent in
2016. All Member States, except for Angola, DRC, Malawi, Mozambique, Swaziland and
Zambia, are expected to achieve the regional inflation target range of 3-7 per cent in 2017.
48. The regional fiscal deficit is expected to improve marginally from 4.7 per cent of GDP in
2016 to 4.3 per cent of GDP in 2017. A total of four Member States (DRC, Lesotho,
Mauritius and Seychelles) are expected to meet the regional target of fiscal deficit of less
than 3 per cent of GDP. Average public debt for the region is projected to deteriorate
further to 52.3 per cent of GDP in 2017 from 49.5 per cent of GDP in 2016. All Member
States are expected to record public debts below 60 per cent of GDP, except for Angola,
Mauritius, Mozambique, Seychelles and Zimbabwe.
49. In the external sector, imports volumes of goods and services for the region are expected
to increase by 3.2 per cent in 2017, which is an improvement compared to a decline of 0.6
per cent in 2016. In terms of exports volumes, the region is expected to record an increase
of 4.4 per cent in 2017 compared to an increase of 2.9 per cent in 2016. The current
account balance is projected at 7.4 per cent of GDP in 2017, almost same level of 7.5 per
cent of GDP recorded in 2016.

IMPLEMENTATION OF PROGRAMMES OF REGIONAL COOPERATION AND
INTEGRATION
1. The year 2016/17 marked the second year of implementation of the Revised Regional
Indicative Strategic Development Plan (RISDP) 2015-2020, which was approved by the
Extraordinary Summit in April 2015 in Harare, Zimbabwe. The strategic objectives of the
Revised RISDP are:
(i) Sustainable industrial development, trade integration and financial cooperation;
(ii) Improved and integrated regional infrastructure;
(iii) Improved peace and security cooperation; and
(iv) Improved human capacities for socio-economic development.
2. In order to contribute towards the above objectives, which are central to regional
cooperation and integration, in 2016/17, the Secretariat, in collaboration with its
stakeholders, facilitated the coordination and implementation of 304 outputs and
milestones across the sector Programmes and Corporate Services. Out of the 304
outputs, 243 were for sector programmes and the remaining 61 were for Corporate
Services. The overall performance, as shown in Figure 8, indicates that of the 304 planned
outputs, 243 (80%) were completed and 61 (20%) were not completed; representing 189
(78%) outputs completed for sector Programmes and 54 (89%) completed for Corporate
Services.

25

-----------------------Page 25 End-----------------------

summary of key achievements for the year under review and their contributions to the
outcomes of the Revised RISDP is given in the following sections.
3.1

INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT AND MARKET INTEGRATION

3.1.1

Industrial Development

4. Work on the implementation of the key milestones on Industrialisation Strategy and
Roadmap, as outlined in the Implementation Framework of the Revised RISDP 2015 2020, continued in 2016/17. The Ministerial Task Force (MTF) on Regional Economic
Integration in July 2016 noted progress on the development of the Draft Costed Action
Plan and referred it for further consultations at national level.
5. Following the consultations at the national level, meetings of the Private Sector and Senior
Officials of the Task Force were convened to provide input into the revised Draft Action
Plan in November 2016. The Action Plan was approved by Summit in March 2017, after it
was recommended by the MTF which met in the margins of Council in March 2017. The
Action Plan details the key actions, organized with reference to the three pillars of the
Strategy, namely, industrialization, competitiveness and regional integration, and outlines
the requisite activities as well as the key enablers needed to unlock industrial potential.
The next steps are to roll out the Action Plan in all Member States, including its costing at
the national level.
6. The mineral and pharmaceutical sectors were profiled and potential areas for developing
regional value chains were identified. The exercise on profiling mineral beneficiation
identified, among others, the following as potential areas for developing regional value
chains:
(i) Energy Mineral Value Chain (coal, oil, gas can be used for power generation as
well as for manufacturing polymers);
(ii) Ferrous Minerals Value Chain (iron ore, zinc, chromium, nickel, manganese,
tungsten for steel production);
(iii) Base-metals Mineral Value Chains (copper and aluminium can be used to
produce products that can be used in manufacturing processes and infrastructure
development);
(iv) Fertilizer Mineral Value Chain (nitrogen from coal and gas, phosphate and
potassium can be used to produce fertilisers); and
(v) Cement Value Chain (limestone resources could be used to produce cement).
7. The exercise on profiling the pharmaceutical sector has identified the following as potential
areas for developing regional value chains:
(i) Antiretrovirals (ARV) value chain;
(ii) Anti-TB drugs value chain;
(iii) Artemisinin Value Chain;
(iv) Condom value chain; and
(v) Bed Net value chain.
8. Further work is required in the profiling of both the mineral and pharmaceutical sectors.
For the mineral sector this will include undertaking detailed value chain mapping on each
product/mineral and development of regional value chain strategies. As for the exercise
26

-----------------------Page 26 End-----------------------

on the pharmaceutical sector, detailed feasibility studies need to be undertaken on each
of the identified value chains and develop bankable projects that could be funded by
investors or development finance institutions.
9. The Industrial Development and Trade Directorate has been established within the
Secretariat to strengthen the institutional set-up to effectively implement the SADC
Industrialization Strategy and Action Plan 2015-2063.
3.1.2

Market Integration

10. In terms of liberalising trade in goods, ten (10) Member States (Madagascar, Mauritius,
Mozambique, Tanzania, Zambia and SACU Member States) have completed the
implementation of Category C tariff phase down. Seychelles acceded to the Protocol on
Trade in June 2015 and has commenced implementation of its obligations under the
SADC Free Trade Area. The Committee of Ministers of Trade considered three standing
items on its agenda involving submissions from Member States who either have
outstanding tariff commitments or were requesting derogation in implementing their tariff
obligations. Final decisions on the submissions are still to be made.
11. Negotiations on Trade in Services are on-going. To date, fourteen (14) Member States
have presented their offers in the first four (4) priority sectors covering financial, tourism,
transport and communication services. Of the offers presented, technical negotiations
have been concluded on nine (9) offers (submitted by DRC, Lesotho, Madagascar,
Mauritius, Mozambique, Seychelles, Swaziland, Tanzania and Zambia) in the four priority
sectors and cross-sectoral (horizontal) commitments, including the movement of natural
persons (Mode 4). Negotiations are close to conclusion on the offers presented by
Botswana, Malawi and South Africa, while those with Namibia and Zimbabwe are still in
progress. Angola is still to present its offer, and is expected to do so following recent
initiatives, including the provision by the Secretariat of requested technical assistance to
assist in this regard.
12. In terms of enhancing the quality and standards competitiveness of goods and services,
the following was achieved:
(i) The SADC Cooperation in Standardization (SADCSTAN) harmonized eleven
(11) fish standards for use in fish trade in the region;
(ii) The Equivalence Methodology for harmonizing technical regulations was
finalised. This was a major breakthrough as it would facilitate easier and faster
harmonization of the technical regulations, thus considerably reducing the
probability of occurrence of NTBs;
(iii) The regulatory authorities of 7 Member States were instructed on the regional
Approach of Regulatory Impact Assessment. This will harmonise the way
regulations are developed and applied across the region;
(iv) The Quality Awards received 21 private sector entries in 2016/17, which shows
that more companies are finding it easier as well as beneficial to apply standards
in their daily operations;

27

-----------------------Page 27 End-----------------------

(v) With more companies in the private sector applying standards, the work and the
need for the SADC Accreditation System (SADCAS) increases, since
accreditation is now the key to international markets. An additional 22 Lead and
Technical Auditors were qualified for SADC registration in 2017;
(vi) Capacity building and installation of National Notification Authorities and National
Enquiry Points in all the Member States was facilitated in order to ensure
compliance with the transparency Clause of the WTO SPS Agreement; and
(vii)A regional SPS Early Warning and Rapid Response System is being initiated in
order to respond to pest invasions such as the Fall armyworm (Spetoptera
frugiperda) and the Tomato Leaf Miner (Tuta absoluta).
13. The EU-SADC Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA), which established a free trade
area (FTA) between the EU and six SADC EPA States (Botswana, Lesotho, Mozambique,
Namibia, South Africa and Swaziland), entered into force in October 2016 following
signature in June 2016 and ratification by September 2016. The seventh SADC EPA
State, Angola, remains an observer. The First Trade and Development Committee (a Joint
Committee of Senior Officials) was established in February 2017, and it, among others,
adopted its Rules of Procedure, mandated the operationalization of implementation of the
Agreement as well as further establishment of technical structures to implement the
Agreement.
14. All eligible Member States have developed and submitted their project applications, with
most Trade Related Facility (TRF) interventions targeting industrial development and
enhanced market integration through addressing non-tariff barriers induced by critical
gaps in customs operations. The projects are in line with SADC integration priorities and
EPA implementation agenda. This included undertaking administrative and technical
evaluation of project applications as laid down in the TRF Operational Guidelines to
conclude Financing Agreements for TRF projects. The approved projects for financing
from 12 eligible SADC Member States under the TRF is valued at Euro 22.8 million.
3.1.3

Financial Market Integration

15. The SADC Integrated Regional Electronic Settlement System (SIRESS) was initially
launched in four Member States of the Common Monetary Area, namely: South Africa,
Namibia, Lesotho and Swaziland, in July 2013 to effect cross border payment instead of using
correspondent bank payment system. To date SIRESS has been rolled out to the 14
Member States. Efforts are on-going to ensure that the remaining Member State
(Madagascar) joins SIRESS soon.
16. As at end of March 2017, SIRESS had settled a total number of 712,099 transactions,
representing ZAR 3.1 trillion. Currently, there is a total number of 83 participating banks,
including Central Banks in SIRESS.
17. Discussions are underway to transform SIRESS into a multicurrency settlement system,
where all SADC currencies, including the US Dollar, will be used to settle transactions in
the system. There are also proposals to consider inclusion of the Chinese Yuan in the
system. There is also need to broaden the payment system to cater for low value
transactions as a means of promoting financial inclusion. Efforts are underway to have the
SIRESS registered as the official SADC electronic settlement system in the region.
28

-----------------------Page 28 End-----------------------

3.1.4

Development Finance

18. With regard to project preparation, the SADC Project Preparation Development Facility
(SADC - PPDF) continues to support Member States to strengthen regional infrastructure
connectivity by providing grants for project preparation and development for cross-border
regional infrastructure projects in energy, transport, ICT and trans-boundary water. This
directly supports the region’s integration and industrialization efforts as well as trade in
goods and services, and helps to improve the quality of lives of its people by improving
access to infrastructure services – electricity, transport, communications and water.
19. The PPDF which is currently funded by the European Union and KfW and hosted by the
Development Bank of Southern Africa (DBSA) supports SADC Member States to
undertake feasibility, technical and engineering designs, environmental and social impact
assessment studies, as well as preparation of tender documents and transaction advisory
services to make projects bankable for financing and implementation. Additional
information on the status of approved regional projects covering energy, transport and
water is given below in section 3.2.1.
20. Work on the operationalisation of the SADC Regional Development Fund is on-going. The
Agreement on the Operationalisation of the SADC Regional Development Fund was
finalised, and seven Member States have signed the Agreement, namely: Angola, DRC,
Lesotho, Mozambique, Swaziland, Tanzania and Zimbabwe. None has yet submitted
instruments of ratification of the Agreement to the Secretariat.
3.1.5

Investment and Tax Related Matters

21. The SADC Investment Policy Framework (IPF) has been developed together with
Implementing and Monitoring Indicators in collaboration with the Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Some Member States, including
Botswana, Madagascar, Malawi, Mauritius and Zambia have started the process of
developing their National Investment Action Programmes with assistance from the
Southern Africa Trade and Investment Hub. The SADC Bilateral Investment Treaty Model
Template is being reviewed to address and adjust to global economic changes. Annex 1
of the Protocol on Finance and Investment (FIP) – Cooperation on Investment, has also
been amended and approved by Summit in August 2016.
22. In the area of Value Added Tax (VAT), Member States agreed that it is best practice that
exemptions and zero-rating (other than on exports, which is consistent with the destination
principle of VAT) should be minimised. Member States further agreed to develop as a
benchmark for the region, standardised minimum lists of exemptions and zero-rated items.
This is in recognition that zero-rating and exemptions from VAT undermine the revenue
efficiency and neutrality of the tax. As such, a Minimum Standardised List of Zero-Rated
and Exempted products was developed and adopted by the Ministers of Finance and
Investment. The intention of the standardised list is to encourage and monitor the coordination of the use of the zero-rating and exemptions with the view to reaching a
harmonised approach within the region.
23. In terms of excise taxes, a Mode of Charge for High Revenue Risk Excisable Goods
(alcohol, tobacco and fuel) has been developed after analysing the current practice
29

-----------------------Page 29 End-----------------------

existing in Member States. In proposing the Mode of Charge, a number of factors were
considered, notably: flexibility and ease of administration; specific circumstances
obtaining in some Member States due to specific circumstances arising from international
agreements/commitments affecting fiscal policy; and membership to certain international
conventions or agreements. The Mode of Charge will form a basis on which Member
States will report, through the Secretariat both their status with regard to the basis of
charge and effective tax rates in a standardised format.
3.1.6

Macroeconomic Convergence Programme

24. Member States’ performance against Macroeconomic Convergence set targets
deteriorated further in 2016 largely due to external factors, unfavourable commodity
prices, weakening exchange rates and nature and climate change related factors, as
already elaborated in section 2.2.2.
25. The peer review mechanism was launched in May 2013. Lesotho and Malawi were the
first Member States to be reviewed in 2014/15; and Angola and Namibia were the peer
reviewers. Angola, Swaziland and Tanzania were reviewed in 2015/16 by Mozambique,
South Africa and Zimbabwe. DRC, Namibia and Zimbabwe were reviewed in JanuaryFebruary 2017 by Malawi, Mauritius and Tanzania. The Peer Review Panel met in July
2017 to consider the peer review reports for DRC, Namibia and Zimbabwe.
3.2

INFRASTRUCTURE SUPPORT FOR REGIONAL INTEGRATION

3.2.1

Progress on the Roll Out of the Regional Infrastructure Development Master Plan

26. Implementation of priority Infrastructure Support for Regional Integration of the Revised
RISDP continued through implementation of the SADC Regional Infrastructure
Development Master Plan (RIDMP). The RIDMP focuses on the realisation of SADC
Infrastructure Vision 2027 and contributes towards the Industrialisation Strategy and
Roadmap as well as other regional strategic frameworks. Significant progress has been
made in terms of creating a pipeline of projects that would be attractive to prospective
investors, the first priority in rolling-out the RIDMP Short Term Action Programme (STAP).
SADC PPDF
27. To date, all the funds of the SADC PPDF amounting to US$16, 260,000 have been
approved and US$15,361,000 has been committed and facility agreements signed with
beneficiaries. Seven (7) out of the eight (8) projects in the approved 2016/17 pipeline
were committed on time.
28. Ten (10) additional projects were received through the SADC PPDF online application
system (www.sadcppdf.org), from April 2016 to 25 January 2017. The Secretariat
conducted Tier One assessment on these projects and five (5) of them did not pass the
criteria for a regional project or a priority project in the SADC region. One (1) project was
referred to the DBSA for consideration as the PPDF funding has been fully subscribed
and due diligence has been completed on one of the remaining four (4) projects. The
appraisal report was approved for funding, subject to the provision of additional funding
for the PPDF.

30

-----------------------Page 30 End-----------------------

Infrastructure Investment Conferences
29. Key Infrastructure Investment Conferences held include:
(i) Investment ready projects in ICT, Transport and Meteorology were showcased at
the joint ICT/TRANSPORT/METEOROLOGY Infrastructure Investment
Roundtable held in Swaziland in October 2016;
(ii) A parallel Thematic Roundtable for Small Landlocked and Oceanic Member
States was held in Swaziland in October 2016, to respond to the special
infrastructure needs of small landlocked countries and oceanic countries;
(iii) The Special Infrastructure Programme for Oceanic Member States was revised
in February 2017 in Port Louis, Mauritius, to include submissions from
Madagascar. The meeting was attended by officials from Madagascar, Mauritius,
Seychelles and the SADC Secretariat;
(iv) The Japan Infrastructure Investment Conference was held in June 2016 in Tokyo,
Japan, organised and hosted by the SADC Committee of Ambassadors in Tokyo;
and
(v) The High Level Ministerial Resources Mobilisation Workshop and Energy
Investment Forum were convened by the Chairperson of SADC in July 2017 in
Ezulwini, Swaziland, and produced a Summary of Recommendations for policy
direction on energy.
Collaboration between SADC-DFRC, AU-NPCA and SADC Secretariat on the AU PIDA
Acceleration Programme
30. The SADC-PIDA Acceleration Programme on the Beira and North-South Corridors was
launched in June 2016 in Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe by the Ministers responsible for Beira
and North-South Corridors. The Ministers approved the list of projects for the two
Corridors; the criteria for prioritising projects; and a roadmap for finalisation of the
Memorandum of Understanding on the North-South Corridor (NSC) and the Agreement
on the Beira Development Corridor (BDC).
31. The top five projects were successfully taken for pre-feasibility studies through technical
assistance from World Bank PPIAF to SADC DFRC-PPP Network. The process
culminated in a private sector and high level (Ministerial) roundtable that was convened
on 20th October 2016 to discuss private sector long term investment financing in
infrastructure in the BDC and NSC, in particular on the Phase I priority projects.
32. The Dondo Dry Port and Francistown-Nata Road projects have qualified for grant
application from the PPDF, following a joint effort with the SADC DFRC-PPP Network.
Three projects, Palapye-Martin’s Drift Road; Francistown-Nata Road; and Batoka Gorge
Hydro Electric Project were presented at the World Economic Forum Africa in Durban,
South Africa in collaboration with the New Sustainable Development Investment
Partnership (SDIP) Africa Hub (OECD/WEF Initiative) hosted by DBSA.
33. The Regional Fund for Water Infrastructure and Basic Sanitation has provided project
implementation funds for the Lomahasha/Namaacha Cross-border Water Supply Project
31

-----------------------Page 31 End-----------------------

(Mozambique and Swaziland) and Kazungula border Water Supply and Sanitation Project
(Zambia).
34. The Southern Africa Power Pool Project Advisory Unit (SAPP-PAU) is working on
preparation and implementation of the following selected and agreed priority regional
electricity projects:
(i) Mphanda Nkuwa and Mozambique Backbone STE Transmission;
(ii) Luapula Hydropower Project;
(iii) Kolwezi-Solwezi Interconnector Transmission; and
(iv) Mozambique-Zambia Interconnector.
3.2.2

Communications and ICT

35. In addition to the four (4) Member States (Malawi, Mauritius, Namibia and United Republic
of Tanzania) that achieved the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) Analogue
Switch-Over (ASO) deadline of 17th June 2015, one (1) more Member State (Swaziland)
completed migration in December 2016. Zambia has its DTT network in operational
mode; South Africa has launched DTT in the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) area and is
on track to migrate by 2018; and Lesotho and Seychelles are at an advanced stage.
Mauritius has completed the DTT Migration process with DVB-T and MPEG2
compression, and therefore has no immediate plans to migrate to DVB-T2. This means
that more Member States are implementing sustainable broadcasting platforms, which
increases opportunities for SADC citizens to create and access content and modern
technologies.
Strengthening Regional Cross-Border Internet Interconnection and Cyber Security within the
Region
36. Following the selection of South Africa and Zimbabwe to develop their National Internet
Exchange Points (NIXPs) to serve as SADC Regional Internet Exchange Points (RIXPs)
in 2015, as part of the African Internet Exchange System (AXIS) initiative, the region has
initiated a process to develop the SADC Regional Cross-Border Interconnection Policy
and Regulatory Framework for RIXPS/RICs which has completed and subject for
approval.
37. In line with the SADC initiative to strengthen cyber security in the region, all Member States
have either transposed some of the SADC Harmonised Model Laws on Cyber Security or
have a cyber-security legal framework in place. The SADC Ministers responsible for
Communications and ICT adopted a Resolution on Cyber Security, in October 2016 which
urges Member States to accelerate the domestication of all the SADC Harmonised Model
Laws and operationalise their National CIRTs by December 2018. Three (3) Member
States already employ Public Capital Infrastructure (PKI), while one (1) Member State is
testing a PKI freeware version. Four (4) Member States already have operational National
Computer Incidence Response Teams (CIRTs), six (6) Member States have completed
the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) CIRT Assessment and are awaiting the
enactment of appropriate legislation to commence operation of a National CIRT, while the
process is still ongoing in two (2) other Member States.

32

-----------------------Page 32 End-----------------------

SADC Home and Away Roaming (SHAR) using Roam Like at Home (RLAH) principle
implemented, monitored and evaluated in all Member States
38. Further to the November 2014 decision of Ministers responsible for ICT, to adopt the RLAH
regime by regulating both the wholesale and retail-roaming tariff using the glide paths for
the next six (6) years, nine (9) Member states had implemented the SHAR using RLAH
principle on a reciprocal basis by December 2016. As a result, the region has renegotiated
160 roaming agreements and an additional 76 are still being negotiated. Tariffs for voice,
SMS and data roaming services have been reduced by an additional 19% in comparison
to October 2016.
3.2.3

Energy

Status of Power Supply and Demand in the Region
39. At end of May 2017 the installed generation capacity in the mainland Member States was
59,543 MW compared to 61,894 MW in May 2016. The installed capacity was affected
by reduction of installed capacity of -3260MW as a result of decommissioning of old power
plants in South Africa. The available operating capacity stands at 54,397 MW against a
demand and reserve of 53,478 MW. When taking into account the current peak demand
and generation capacity reserve margins, the Regional capacity surplus is 919 MW. The
installed capacity in Oceanic Member States is 782 MW, 246MW, and 106 MW for
Mauritius, Madagascar and Seychelles, respectively. These result in total installed
capacity of 60,677 MW for all SADC Member States.
40. In 2016, the region commissioned 4 180 MW against the planned 3771 MW. The
additional capacity came from the following Member States Angola - 780 MW; Malawi 10 MW; Mozambique - 175 MW; Namibia - 15 MW; South Africa - 2,550 MW; Tanzania 150 MW; Zambia - 300 MW and Zimbabwe - 200 MW. The projects were commissioned
by both Public Utilities and Independent Power Producers (IPPs).
41. Out of the power plants commissioned in 2016, hydro-power, solar and wind contributed
64% of generated power, wind 24%, whilst fossil fuels (coal and diesel) added only 12
percent. In addition, the share of renewable energy is gradually increasing in the overall
power generation mix.
42. As part of the initiative to strengthen the supply side of the sector, Member States are
adjusting tariffs on an annual basis and gradually migrating towards cost reflective tariffs
with a pro-poor component. This is expected to attract investment into infrastructure
development and result in supply stability.
43. On the Energy Demand Side Management (DSM), Member States have a standing DSM
Annual Target to save 4 500 MW from implementing efficiency initiatives. The initiative is
supported by the Energy Ministers decision of July 2015 to phase out energy intensive
incandescent bulbs in the region by the end of 2017.
Energy Sector Regulatory Framework
44. The region is committed to reach cost reflective electricity tariffs by end of 2019. As at the
end of May 2017, fourteen (14) SADC Member States had introduced some kind of
33

-----------------------Page 33 End-----------------------

regulatory oversight in the form of energy or electricity regulatory authorities. In 2016/17
Botswana and Mauritius joined other Member States by operationalising their energy
regulators.
Energy Access
45. In pursuing the attainment of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDGs)
on increasing energy access for all, the region is, among others, participating in the global
processes of the UN Sustainable Energy for All (SE4All) Initiative, whose principal
objective is to achieve Universal Energy Access by 2030. The region is also pursuing
initiatives to ensure universal access to modern energy services; doubling the rate of
improvement in energy efficiency; and doubling the share of renewable energy in the
regional energy mix.
46. Overall access to electricity in the Region increased from 36% in September 2015 to about
45% by the end March of 2017.
Renewable Energy
47. The interim operationalisation of SADC Centre for Renewable Energy and Energy
Efficiency and development of the SADC Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency
Strategy and Action Plan are key initiatives at the regional level that support scaling up of
small scale renewable energy initiatives to fulfil the objectives of the SE4All Initiative.
48. One of the notable initiatives at regional level, is the participation of eight (8) Member
States (Botswana, Lesotho, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania
and Zambia) in Phase 2 (2013 – 2017) of the EEP programme that will come to an end by
December 2017. However, the supporting Partners, including the governments of Finland,
the United Kingdom and Austria, have initiated the planning process for the third Phase of
the EEP. The intention is to transform EEP into a multi-donor trust fund that will be
managed by the Nordic Development Fund (NDF). Details on this third phase will be
announced during the second half of 2017.
3.2.4

Transport

49. In addition to the two major undertakings relating to corridor transport below, more on what
was completed regarding transport activities is described in sections 3.4.1.2 and 5.2.
One-Stop-Border Post
50. A key element of the Corridor transport and logistics infrastructure programme is the
development of One Stop Border Posts (OSBP) as a means to reduce transaction costs
for crossing a border.
51. The Secretariat, NPCA, DBSA and JICA have launched and started the process of
domesticating the OSBP Source Book 2 nd Edition. The Source Book is a toolkit to guide
policy-makers; trade and transport practitioners, which would also assist the Secretariat
in formulating regional policies and programmes on OSBPs. Member States are also
developing their OSBP work plans that will form the bigger SADC/COMESA OSBP
Programme to be implemented.
34

-----------------------Page 34 End-----------------------

Lobito Development Corridor
52. The Secretariat, in collaboration with the African Development Bank, participated in the
appraisal missions to Angola and Zambia for consultations concerning the design of the
Lobito Development Corridor Trade and Transport Project. The Lobito Development
Corridor Trade Facilitation Project is a technical assistance and capacity building project
to support development and implementation of trade facilitation measures and the
development of value chains and economic clusters along the Corridor. The objective is
to contribute to the expansion of domestic and cross-border trade and inclusiveness along
the Corridor. The Project will be financed through a UA6 million (approximately USD8.4
million) grant from the African Development Fund-Regional Operations Envelope (ADFROE).
3.2.5

Water

Water Infrastructure Pilot Projects
53. In addition to the completed Pilot Projects in Botswana, Lesotho, Mozambique and
Namibia under the Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) programme, which
were handed over to the benefiting communities in September 2015, the Zimbabwe pilot
projects in the Limpopo River Basin have been completed. These included the community
irrigation and water supply projects in Ntalale in Zimbabwe. The pilot projects for South
Africa within the same Basin will be undertaken in the next phase of the project.
Lomahasha-Namaacha Water Supply and Sanitation Project
54. The Beneficiary Member States (Mozambique and Swaziland) and the Regional Water
Fund Management Unit (hosted by DBSA) are negotiating the project Financing
Agreement for €8.0 million for financing Phase 1 of the project. Phase 1 covers water
supply from Simunye, Swaziland to both the Lomahasha (Swaziland) and Namaacha
(Mozambique) border towns. The Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) study is
currently being updated to meet requirements of the national environmental authorities of
the two Member States.
Kazungula Water Supply and Sanitation Projects
55. Negotiations on the project implementation Financing Agreement between the
Government of Zambia and the Regional Fund Management Unit are at advanced stage.
The DFID Climate Resilient Infrastructure Facility (CRIDF) which funded upstream work
for the project has also offered to fund the detailed project designs for the project.
Transboundary Water Resources Management
56. Pursuant to the implementation of the Revised Protocol on Shared Watercourses in the
SADC region, a number of initiatives are underway in the various River Basins. These
include the recent (July 2016) signing of the Pungwe River Basin Bilateral Cooperation
Agreement by Mozambique and Zimbabwe; the initiation of discussions between the
Government of Angola and Namibia to establish a Kunene Water Commission
(KUNECOM); and the process of operationalizing the establishment of the Inco-Maputo
Basin Commission Secretariat to be hosted by the Government of the Kingdom of
35

-----------------------Page 35 End-----------------------

Swaziland on behalf of the riparian states of the two basins, namely Mozambique, South
Africa and Swaziland.
57. Strengthening of the Cuvelai Watercourse Commission institutions has also been
accelerated with the commissioning of two studies, funded by GIZ, namely the Scoping
Study for the Enhancement of Transboundary Water Management of the Basin, and the
Rapid Assessment of the Cuvelai Basin. The studies aim to improve flood risk
management and to support institutional and joint planning dialogues between the riparian
states of Angola and Namibia.
Climate Change and Disaster Risk Reduction
58. In response to the pervasive climate change related challenges, the Water and
Meteorology sectors have combined effort to undertake preparedness and
responsiveness initiatives. The intention is to inform policy decision-making and planning
by providing reliable information to support early warning for flood and drought
management and for disaster preparedness. A key element which has been built into
these responses is sustainability.
59. The SADC Hydrological Cycle Observation System (SADC HYCOS) Project which was
implemented jointly by the Meteorology and Water sectors has been completed, and
products have been circulated to all Member States for their use and future reference.
These include regional flood hazard/risk maps and Disaster Risk Reduction strategies for
flood risk management in selected transboundary River Basins flooding hot spots;
Regional Strategies on climate change and variability based on hot spot areas in the
Zambezi and Limpopo Basins.
3.2.6

Tourism

Implementation of the Regional Tourism Growth and Development Strategy (2020)
60. The Institutional Transformation of RETOSA has been completed in line with the decision
of the Ministers of Tourism taken in July 2016. The completion of the transformation
process marks an important milestone in the region’s endeavour to strategically poise itself
as a destination of choice in the global tourism market. The transformed RETOSA,
supported by the newly established Tourism development desk of the SADC Secretariat,
will continue to play a lead role in promoting the region as a single multi-faceted tourism
destination by providing policy guidance and coordination for the sector, thus enabling
RETOSA to effectively undertake the regional tourism marketing function.
61. RETOSA continued to support Member States on soft infrastructure development and
enhancement of tourism services as part of the Regional Tourism Growth and
Development Strategy. RETOSA also produced the revised Southern Africa Harmonised
Star Grading Standards which have been adopted by Member States. This is a
Comprehensive Standards List covering more than 1,850 standards ranging across 6
categories of accommodation, namely: urban hotels; vacation hotels and resorts; selfservice accommodation; guest houses and B&Bs; nature lodges; and campgrounds and
caravan camps.

-----------------------Page 36 End-----------------------

62. In terms of training, RETOSA has trained and certified 24 Regional Quality Standards
Assessors from 9 Member States and 40 delegates from 10 Member States in digital and
social media marketing. RETOSA also conducted training in Meetings, Incentives,
Conferences and Events (MICE) Destination Marketing in June 2016 as part of the
Regional Tourism Marketing, Communications and Public Relations Forum.
63. The Online Certified Southern Africa Travel and Tourism Training Programme for Service
Providers (https://certifiedexpert.retosa.co.za) launched during 2015 has trained over 200
learners who were certified during 2016. It is expected that the number of certified
practitioners will continue to increase once the ongoing development of the Portuguese
and French versions of the e-learning programme on marketing the region as a tourism
destination of choice is completed.
3.2.7

Meteorology

Compliance to International Aviation Safety Regulations
64. Assurance of aviation safety has improved significantly in the region, as ten (10) Member
States have obtained Quality Management System (QMS) ISO9001.2008 certification.
The remaining Member States are at various stages of satisfying the QMS ISO9001.2008
certification requirements. The compliance on Quality Management System (QMS)
provides assurance to users that the supplied meteorological information is in line with the
stated requirements for geographical and spatial coverage, format and content, time and
frequency of issuance and period of validity, as well as the accuracy of measurements,
observations and forecasts.
Provision of Reliable Climate Information for Early Warning
65. The capacity of the SADC Climate Services Centre (CSC) to generate quality, reliable
climate information has been improved through the construction of the CSC Laboratory,
provision of equipment and connecting the Centre to the global meteorological system.
Construction of the laboratory was completed in September 2016. Equipment for climate
monitoring, dynamic seasonal forecasting and issuing climate watch products; and a
Telecommunication System called Automatic Message Switch System (AMSS) for rapid
data collection, exchange and dissemination which connects the centre to the WMO
Global Telecommunication System and to the Global Producing Centre were installed by
December 2016. The Centre is now better equipped to collect global meteorological and
climate information to generate regional forecasts which Member States are, in turn, able
to downscale to generate national forecasts.
66. Following the 19th Annual Southern African Regional Climate Outlook Forum (SARCOF19) for the 2015/16 rainfall season, which warned the region of drought, the 20th Annual
Southern African Regional Climate Outlook Forum (SARCOF-20) provided the seasonal
climate forecast, which advised about the waning of the drought that had gripped most
parts the region in the 2015/16 rainfall season. However, the SARCOF-20 warnings
indicated that the drought will continue to grip most of Tanzania during the 2016/17
season. During SARCOF-20, the Climate Services Centre carried out capacity building
for 25 regional and national climate experts on statistical seasonal forecasting, and
provided training on interpretation of SARCOF products for more than 30 end-users.

37

-----------------------Page 37 End-----------------------

67. The CSC also issued the Integrated Regional Early Warning Bulletin (REWB), on climate
sensitive sectors as part of SARCOF-20. Another key milestone, was the launch of the
SADC Climate Services Centre website in December 2016. The site is still under beta
testing and when it is fully operational, it will enhance access to and availability of
information to all users.
68. The Chairperson of SADC, King Mswati III as part of his familiarization visit to the SADC
Secretariat had occasion to tour the Climate Services Centre on 9 May 2017. His Majesty,
King Mswati III appreciated the technological configuration and functionality of the CSC
Laboratory and Training Centre. Following His Majesty’s visit, the CSC noted the need to
provide comprehensive climate information and prediction services to enhance
sustainable socio-economic planning and development in Member States.
3.3

PEACE AND SECURITY COOPERATION
69. In addition to the accomplishments described in Section 2.1 of the report on political
developments, linked with the Revised RISDP Priority C on Peace and Security
Cooperation as well as the SIPO objectives, progress was also made in the areas
described below.

Conflict Prevention Management and Resolution
70. The Mediation Support Unit (MSU) provided comprehensive (technical, administrative and
logistical, and financial) support to regional initiatives, including TROIKA Missions, to the
DRC (2), Republic of Madagascar (1) and the Kingdom of Lesotho (3), contributing to
relative stability to the respective Member States. Four (4) Mediation Missions of the
Oversight Committee to Lesotho were also undertaken. The Mediation Missions to
Lesotho have been accompanied by capacity building and training components which has
been extended to various stakeholders to deepen the Member State’s internal capacity to
respond to conflict.
71. The MSU finalised the Regional Mediation Training Curriculum (RMTC) and training has
been conducted in seven regional workshops. A total of 215 mediators have been trained
in the seven regional and national workshops held within the third and fourth quarters,
aiming for a target of 500 by March, 2018. The MSU is also facilitating the implementation
of UN Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 1325 on Women, Peace and Security in the
SADC region in collaboration with the UN Department of Political Affairs, UN Women and
the SADC Gender Unit. The draft Regional Strategy on Women Peace and Security has
been considered by Member States experts and is ready for validation. The MSU has
collaborated with the Civilian Component of the SADC Standby Force, the RPTC and the
African Union in efforts to explore possible formats and frameworks for the development
of the database, which is currently under development.
Democratic institutions and practices in the region
72. The draft Curriculum, Training Manual and Handbook for SADC Election Observers, which
aim to instil expert skills in Long- and Short-Term Election Observers, in line with the
relevant provisions of the revised SADC Principles and Guidelines Governing Democratic
Elections, have been completed and have gone through pre-validation processes of the
SADC Electoral Advisory Council (SEAC). The draft SEAC Strategy for the Prevention of
Election-Related Conflicts, which will assist in the early detection and resolution of conflict
38

-----------------------Page 38 End-----------------------

in the electoral process; and contribute to the overall strengthening of the Organ on Politics
and Security Cooperation Conflict Prevention Strategies, has also been completed and
validated by the SEAC meeting in June 2017.
73. The SEAC, has also undertaken a number of pre-election and post-election assessment
missions. These included awareness-raising interventions on the revised SADC Principles
and Guidelines Governing Democratic Elections, involving electoral stakeholders (e.g.
Electoral Management Bodies, Political Parties, Civil Society, Media) across the region to
deepen the culture of democratic practice that will contribute to various aspects such as
the assessment of post-electoral climates and follow-up on the implementation of
recommendations from the SADC Electoral Observation Mission (SEOM) and SEAC
reports in electoral processes and the promotion of adherence to common electoral
standards.
Implementation of the SADC Regional Counter-Terrorism Strategy and Action Plan
74. Member States are at different stages of developing their respective National CounterTerrorism Strategies. During the period under review, the Secretariat assisted the
Republics of Namibia and Botswana on the process to develop their Strategies. A
workshop to review the implementation of the Strategy and Action Plan was held in Dar
es Salaam in March 2017, and a Roadmap to towards its completion was developed. The
workshop also observed that the implementation of the Strategy and Action Plan was
encountering several challenges, including the absence of harmonized legislation to
address terrorism at national and regional levels; inadequate resources to implement the
measures; lack of capacity of security and border personnel to effectively implement the
Strategy; and poor understanding of the indicators of radicalization and violent extremism.
Regional Peacekeeping Training Centre (RPTC)
75. The RPTC developed a five-year Strategic Plan which was approved by the MCO in July
2016. The Plan aims at strengthening support towards training and planning for SADC
Peace Support Operations. The RPTC also assessed training needs and identified
capacity gaps at Regional and Member State levels and formulated the SADC RPTC
Operational Plan (2017 -2021) for the implementation of the Strategy. The Report on the
SADC RPTC Training Needs, the SADC RPTC Operational Plan 2017-2021 and the
SADC RPTC Training Calendar 2017/18 were approved by the MCO in July 2017. The
MCO meeting also congratulated Col. Panganai Kahuni for his appointment as the Deputy
Commandant of the RPTC.
Coordination of regional cooperation in the area of Defence and Security
76. Coordination of regional cooperation in the area of Defence and Security continued during
the reporting period. This included exchange of information vital for decision-making in
this area as well as participation of the Region’s Defence forces in peace time military
exercises. Defence establishments in the Region continued to participate in peace time
military exercises such as the Sixth Edition of the SADC Air Forces/Arms/Wings
interoperability Humanitarian Aid (HA) Joint Exercise Blue - Okavango in 2015, Botswana.
The exercise, based on HA Operations coupled with an element of Peace Support
Operations, transported a total of 448.65 Metric Tonnes (MT) from the planed 150 MT of
HA from Gaborone to Maun.
39

-----------------------Page 39 End-----------------------

77. With regard to the MOU between SADC and the Government of Russia, the MOU in the
Area of Military and Technical Cooperation was endorsed by MCO in July 2017 and is
being submitted to Summit for approval. The African Peace and Security Architecture
(APSA) Support Programme III has resumed. Initially, the programme was scheduled to
run for two years from 1st January 2017 to 31st December 2018, however, owing to some
administrative challenges, its commencement was delayed. The programme which started
in July 2017 and will end in December 2018, is to the tune of Euro 4,500 million and
allocation for this financial year is about Euro 1,830,000 Euros.
78. The operationalisation of the SADC Regional Logistics Depot (RLD) remains on course.
The draft Layout Plans for the RLD, was approved by the Defence Sub-Committee (DSC)
at its meeting held in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania in May 2017. The process of developing
a MoU between SADC and the Government of Botswana for the protection of the RLD is
on-going and a Project Manager was recruited and began work in June 2017.
Southern Africa Liberation Day
79. In line with Council Decision of August 2016 for the Secretariat to develop a Criteria and
Guiding Principles for the commemoration of the Southern Africa Liberation Day, in
February 2017, the Inter State Politics and Diplomacy Committee (ISPDC) identified 8
December and 23 March as the two dates on which to commemorate the Day. The two
dates are deemed to be of historical significance to the region; the 8 th December 1974
marks the date when the Frontline States initiated the liberation of struggle of Southern
Africa, while the 23rd March 1988 marks the end of the liberation struggle where the
liberation armies of Namibia, South Africa and Angola defeated the apartheid South
African Defence Force with the support of Cuban troops. The MCO in July 2017 referred
the matter back to Member States for further consultations. The MCO also recommended
that Southern African Liberation history be included in school syllabuses to ensure that
the younger generations in the region learn the history of the liberation struggles.
Trust in Honour of SADC Founding Fathers
80. The August 2015 meeting of Summit directed the Secretariat to devise a mechanism to
honour the SADC founding fathers. Various meetings of Council, the MCO and the ISPDC
have considered the proposal to operationalise the mechanism which is aimed at
recognising and honouring SADC’s founding fathers for their contribution to regional
integration in Southern Africa. It is expected that the internal consultations in Member
States will be concluded soon to enable the implementation of the mechanism in honour
of the SADC Founding Fathers.
SARPCCO Centre of Excellence
81. SARPCCO Centre of Excellence was conceived through Decision 11 of the 18 th SADC
Police Chiefs Sub Committee Annual General meeting held in Dar es Salaam, United
Republic of Tanzania on 15 May 2013. The Centre of Excellence offers ten (10) courses.
The first intake of 16 students has been enrolled and the programme will be funded by
Member States. Staffing levels need to be considered for improvement through
secondment of officers. There is also a need to conduct sustainability assessment for
funding modalities for the Centre.

SPECIAL PROGRAMMES OF REGIONAL DIMENSION

3.4.1

AGRICULTURE, FOOD SECURITY AND NATURAL RESOURCES

82. Agriculture plays contributes between 4% and 27% of GDP and approximately 13% of
overall export earnings in the region. Despite its importance in the regional economy and
food security, the agriculture and natural resources sector continues to face challenges
that include food shortages, under production and declining yields in agriculture, land
degradation and unsustainable use of some of the region’s natural resources. In its efforts
to try and address these challenges, the Secretariat is guided by the Revised RISDP 2015
- 2020 and the Regional Agricultural Policy.
3.4.1.1 REGIONAL AGRICULTURAL POLICY
83. The Regional Agricultural Policy (RAP), which defines common agreed objectives and
measures to guide, promote and support actions at regional and national levels in the
agricultural sector, was endorsed by Council in August 2014 in Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe.
The Regional Agricultural Investment Plan (RAIP) 2017-2022, was developed and
approved by Ministers responsible for Agriculture and Food Security in July 2016 in
Ezulwini, Swaziland and endorsed by Council in March 2017 also in Ezulwini, Swaziland.
It defines the first five-year priority programmes for implementation as follows:
(i) Increase Agricultural Production, Productivity and Competitiveness;
(ii) Increase Access to Markets and Trade of Agriculture Products;
(iii) Increase Investments in and Access to Finance for Agriculture;
(iv) Reduce Social and Economic Vulnerability in the Region; and
(v) Improve Food and Nutrition Security for the Region.
84. The 2017/18 Annual Operational Plan and Budget for the FANR Directorate incorporates
the priority interventions identified from the 2017 – 2022 RAIP. The Secretariat has also
mobilised some €9.0 million under the 11th Cycle of the European Development Fund
(EDF11) to support the operationalisation of priority interventions through a project titled
“Support Towards the Operationalization of SADC Regional Agricultural Policy (RAP)”.
The Project, to be implemented over a period of 36 months, is aimed at:
(i) enhancing access to information on agricultural production, productivity and
competitiveness for evidence-based decision-making;
(ii) improving access to markets through implementation of strategies towards the
control of plant and animal pests and diseases at the regional level; and
(iii) providing support towards implementation of the Regional Food and Nutrition
Security Strategy.
85. Moreover, the region is working on establishing an Agricultural Development Fund (ADF)
as a Special Facility under the Regional Development Fund (RDF) in accordance with
Article 8 of the Agreement and Operationalisation of the SADC RDF to support for the
implementation of Regional Agricultural Investment Plans of the RAP.

41

-----------------------Page 41 End-----------------------

3.4.1.2 THE REGIONAL FOOD SECURITY SITUATION
86. The Regional Early Warning System and Vulnerability Assessment programme continued
to collect, analyse and disseminate data and information on food security situation in the
region. The information is aimed at facilitating preparedness and early action in order to
prevent or reduce the impact of food insecurity disasters. The data and information
collected also supported the development and monitoring of the SADC Regional
Humanitarian Appeal which was launched in July 2016 as a result of the 2015/16 El-Nino
induced disaster.
Overview of 2016/17-rainfall season performance
87. The 2016/17 rainfall season was characterized by a slow onset during October and
November 2016, but improved significantly in December 2016 and was well above normal
until March 2017. The above average rains were received in the central and southern parts
of the region, with over 150 per cent of normal rainfall recorded in many areas over the
December to March period.
88. The high rains led to good soil moisture conditions, which was conducive for crop
development with prospects of improved harvests across the region. In some parts of the
region, such as Madagascar, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, central parts of Tanzania
and Zimbabwe, the high rainfall led to flooding. This resulted in increased risk for
waterborne disease outbreaks, damage to crops and properties and the loss of human
and animal lives. There were also cases of waterlogging, and leaching of soil nutrients.
89. In contrast to the high rains received in the central and southern areas of the region,
western and northeastern parts of the region, received well below average rainfall. Areas
affected included western parts of Angola and Namibia, northern parts of Mozambique,
northern and eastern parts Madagascar, western parts of South Africa and central
Tanzania. The poor rains, combined with high temperatures in these areas negatively
affected crop development and are likely to reduce harvests in the affected areas.
Agricultural Performance and Food security
90. Overall, the 2017/18 food security situation across the region is expected to improve
significantly as a result of better rainfall experienced during the 2016/17 growing season,
except for the western and north eastern parts where there was below normal rainfall.
Cereal production
91. The current food security situation in the region indicates an overall cereal (maize, wheat,
sorghum, millet and rice) production of 43.74 million tonnes compared to season’s harvest
of 30.52 million tonnes (see Table 2) for the eleven Member States that submitted
production data of the two past seasons. This represents an increase of 43.3% from the
previous harvest, which was affected by the severe drought that was experienced across
most of the region.

92. The supply and demand analysis based on the 11 Member States (Angola, Botswana,
Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia and
Zimbabwe) that submitted their food balance sheets shows that the region recorded an
overall cereal surplus of 5.8 million MT in comparison to the 6.4 million MT deficit of the
previous year (2016/17) (see Table 3). Individually, however, Angola, Botswana, Lesotho,
Namibia, and Swaziland have overall cereal deficit, and will require imports to cover the
shortfalls. The combined cereal shortfall of 2.5 million MT from these Member States will
easily be covered by the region surplus.

Root crop production
93. Root and tuber (cassava, sweet potato and Irish potato) crop production, which marginally
increased between 2014/15 and 2015/16 agricultural seasons has also increased in the
current production season 2016/17 with 5% for cassava, 37% for sweet potatoes and 14%
for potatoes. This increase will augment the food supply/availability in the region for the
2017/18 marketing year.
94. The 2017/18 seasonal rainfall forecast will be released in August 2017 during the annual
Southern African Regional Climate Outlook Forum (SARCOF) organized by the SADC
Climate Services Centre (CSC). The SARCOF forecast is a comprehensive forecast
incorporating the influence of various factors affecting climate in southern Africa, including
the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO). ENSO is a global climate phenomenon that is
at any time in one of three states: (1) El Niño conditions, (2) neutral state or (3) La Niña
conditions. Southern Africa was affected by severe El Niño droughts during the 2014/15
and 2015/16 seasons, while the 2016/17 season was affected by La Niña, which is now
over, with the ENSO state having transitioned to a neutral phase.
95. Currently, the majority of forecasting models from international climate centres are
predicting a recurrence of El-Niño conditions from around July 2017, to persist for the
remainder of the year. While this is a very early forecast and liable to changes over the
coming months, the region is urged to prudently utilize the anticipated surplus and prepare
contingency planning in case the El-Niño prediction materializes.

-----------------------Page 44 End-----------------------

Fisheries and Aquaculture
96. The fisheries and aquaculture sectors in the SADC region employs a total of 3.4 million
people, equivalent to 1.3% of the SADC population. It accounts for an estimated 3.54% of
the region’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and 8.99% of the region’s agriculture GDP
(see Table 4). More than 95% of this production comes from a diversified but now
stagnating capture fisheries sub-sector, which produces 2.4 million tonnes, while a small
but growing percentage comes from an emerging aquaculture sub-sector producing
69,851 metric tonnes (FAO FishStat, 2016).

Update on SADC Regional Humanitarian Appeal
97. Since the launch of the SADC Regional Humanitarian Appeal by the SADC Chairperson
in July 2016, and as per information received at the Secretariat, Member States and the
international community had contributed about US$1.034 billion (Member States $222
million and the international community, US$812 million), representing 35% of the required
amount of US$2.9 billion. In the meantime, the SADC El-Niňo Logistics and Coordination
Team, which constituted the SADC Secretariat staff and staff from the UN agencies to
coordinate the response to the Appeal, ended its operations on 31 March 2017. Amongst
others, the Team developed a Transport Plan for Coordination of Humanitarian Relief
Cargo estimated at 9.3 million metric tonnes of cereals and other non-food items from sea
ports through different corridors in the region.
98. The Secretariat, with financial support from the Regional Inter-Agency Standing
Committee (RIASCO) for Southern Africa, has initiated a regional evaluation of the
Humanitarian Appeal process and response. The objective is to assess the effectiveness
of the response by Member States, the SADC Secretariat, UN Agencies and other
stakeholders to the EL Niňo induced 2015/16 disaster. The evaluation is also expected
to document lessons learned for future response to similar disasters.

3.4.1.3 FOOD AND NUTRITION SECURITY STRATEGY
99. Nutrition status is a result of complex interaction between food consumption and the
overall status of health and care practices. Nutrition assessment in the SADC region
during the reporting period showed that around 513 000 children were in need of lifesaving treatment for severe acute malnutrition and 778 000 for moderate acute
malnutrition and this is being addressed through the Appeal. The Secretariat continues to
monitor the region’s food and nutrition security through the regional and national early
warning systems and vulnerability assessments and analysis programmes.
3.4.1.4 AGRICULTURAL INPUT SUPPLY
100. The Secretariat continued to operationalize the SADC Harmonized Seed Regulatory
System (HSRS) through the SADC Seed Centre. Eleven (11) Member States are
currently signatory to the Memorandum of Understanding on the implementation of the
harmonised seed regulations in the region, which entered into force in July 2014.
101. Since the launch of the web-based Seed Variety Release System in November 2014, a
total of 25 varieties has been released and registered regionally. The Protocol on Plant
Breeders Rights, which is expected to promote investments in seed industry and enhance
access to quality seed and elite varieties in the region, was approved by Ministers of
Agriculture and Food Security and was submitted to the Ministers of Justice and Attorney
Generals for clearance in July 2017.
102. The Charter Establishing the SADC Seed Centre Charter, which is also an instituting
document to enhance coordination and implementation of the Harmonised Seed
Regulatory System, is still to be submitted to the Ministers of Justice and Attorney
Generals for clearance after it was approved by Ministers in July 2016.
103. The Secretariat continues to work with Member States, private sector and other
stakeholders to enhance smooth implementation of the system, and has convened a
number of training and awareness workshops on the components of the SADC
Harmonized Seed System.
3.4.1.5 SURVEILLANCE AND CONTROL OF TRANSBOUNDARY PLANT AND ANIMAL DISEASES AND PESTS
104. Transboundary plant pests and diseases continue to pose a significant threat to the
regional food security and trade. The pests and diseases that have been identified as
eminent threats include the Asian Fruitfly, Tuta absoluta, Panama Disease, Banana
Bunchy Top Virus disease, Lethal Maize Necrosis Diseases and the recently introduced
Fall armyworm. All SADC Member States have been capacitated on surveillance and
monitoring techniques to facilitate early detection to enhance preparedness while also
harmonising control efforts. Technical meetings have been held to allow for information
and experience sharing as an early warning mechanism and to promote timely application
of control interventions.
105. Some resources have been mobilized under the EDF 11 to support implementation of
strategies towards the control of plant and animal pests and diseases, including tick borne
diseases, at the regional level.

3.4.1.6 JOINT MANAGEMENT OF TRANSBOUNDARY NATURAL RESOURCES (FISHERIES, FORESTRY,
WILDLIFE AND TRANSFRONTIER CONSERVATION AREAS)
106. The Secretariat continued to coordinate the implementation of activities with regards to
ssustainable management and conservation of wildlife and transboundary natural
resources. A Joint meeting of Ministers of Environment and Natural Resources and of
the Organ on Politics, Defence and Security Cooperation (MCO) to discuss
implementation modalities of the SADC Law Enforcement and Anti-Poaching Strategy
(2016-2021) was held in February 2017 in Swaziland. The key recommendations of the
meeting were presented to Council in March 2017, and a number of decisions were
made, which are aimed at, among others, facilitating collaboration of conservation and
security sectors in addressing the wildlife crime and trafficking challenges.
107. A range of activities were organised at the Convention on International Trade in
Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES COP 17) in collaboration with
Member States to showcase the SADC Transfrontier Conservation Areas (TFCAs)
Programme as it relates to conservation, economic development and regional integration.
These included:
(i) a SADC TFCA exhibition stand;
(ii) four thematic side events, namely: Species Conservation in SADC TFCAs;
Community engagement and economic potential of TFCAs; Cross-border law
enforcement in SADC region and Governance of SADC TFCAs. The side events
were well attended and the booth was a permanent feature during the COP
showcasing and distributing various materials and documents on SADC TFCAs.
108. Under the TFCA network, a forum of TFCA stakeholders was organized to share learning,
knowledge management, foster collaboration and innovation. Four Communities of
Practice (COPs) have been established, including capacity building, tourism, monitoring
and data management. The COPs enable practitioners to discuss key issues and
implement the programme on behalf of Member States. The integrated SADC TFCA web
portal was established and officially launched in September 2016 to facilitate learning,
information sharing and knowledge management.
109. Three thematic Expert Working Groups (EWG) were established in September 2016 as
part of the SADC/JICA Project in order to spearhead the implementation of project
activities. They include EWG on Forest Information system, Integrated Forest Fire
Management and Participatory Forest Management.
110. On the establishment of the SADC Fisheries Monitoring, Control and Surveillance
(MCS) Coordination Centre, a financial model that include risk mitigation measures, is
currently been finalised. In addition, Ministers responsible for Fisheries and Aquaculture
adopted the draft Charter establishing the Centre in Mozambique and recommended it
for legal clearance by Ministers of Justice/Attorneys General.
111. The SADC Regional Aquatic Animal Health Strategy (2016-2026) was approved by
the Ministers of Agriculture and Food Security in November 2016, while the SADC
Regional Aquaculture Strategy and Action Plan (2016-2026) was approved by
Ministers responsible for Agriculture, Food Security, Fisheries and Aquaculture in May
47

-----------------------Page 47 End-----------------------

2017. Several training and consultative workshops have been held to facilitate
implementation of the two strategies.
3.4.1.7 ENVIRONMENT AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
112. The Secretariat continued to coordinate and facilitate the implementation of Multilateral
Environmental Agreements by Member States. During the reporting period assistance
was provided in the development of the SADC Regional Common Position for the 17th
Conference of Parties for the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species
of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES COP17). The common position was adopted by the
Ministers responsible for Environment and Natural Resources and was used by Member
States during COP 17 that took place from 24 September to 5 October 2016 in
Johannesburg, South Africa. It enabled a coordinated and united approach by Member
States in engaging with the COP17 agenda.
3.4.1.8 CONSERVATION OF PLANT GENETIC RESOURCES
113. The SADC Plant Genetic Resources Centre (SPGRC) based in Lusaka, Zambia,
continued to conserve and sustain plant and animal genetic resources to improve
agricultural production and maintenance of species diversity for present and future
generations. SPGRC works through a network of National Plant Genetic Resource
Centres established in most of the SADC Member States. Among others, the SPGRC
carried out the following:

(i) Initiated and supported efforts to establish National Plant Genetic Resources
Centres (NPGRCs) in Member States that for some reasons have not been
established. This included visits and technical consultations to DRC and
Madagascar where in both instances, location and frameworks for
establishment have been agreed with national authorities;
(ii) Technical backstopping missions to Lesotho, Madagascar, Mauritius,
Mozambique, Namibia to, among others, install the newly developed webbased documentation system, advise on international standards of
genebanking, strengthen the management of crop diversity on farmer’s fields
for use in sustainable production and for supporting rural livelihoods;
(iii) Seeds (sample numbers) were received from Mauritius and South Africa as
national duplicates to the regional centre for long-term conservation. Import
permits were prepared and forwarded to Botswana to facilitate the shipment
of the samples to SPGRC. Materials with low viability were planted at the
SPGRC Farm to extend the longevity. Meanwhile, 351 rice seed samples
were multiplied for SPGRC in Malawi, where soil and weather conditions are
suitable; and
(iv) In collaboration with NPGRCs farmer training workshops were convened in
Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Namibia, Tanzania, Swaziland and South Africa.
Seed fairs were conducted in Malawi and Zimbabwe.

3.4.2

SOCIAL AND HUMAN DEVELOPMENT

3.4.2.1 EDUCATION AND SKILLS DEVELOPMENT
114. In order to address societal and other barriers to the provision of quality, relevant and
sustainable education and training, which continue to inhibit life-long learning
opportunities of the largest population group of the region (children and youth), a number
of outputs were realized, and include the ones described below.
Draft Regional Policy Framework for Teachers and for Teacher Training
115. The development of the Comprehensive Regional Policy Framework for Teachers is ongoing. A Draft Report of a Regional Study on the status of development of professional
standards and competencies in the region to map the areas of teacher’s work in the
Teacher Policy Framework, and validated in October 2016, confirmed that many Member
States are developing teacher’s standards and competences. It was agreed that the
development of Regional Teachers Standards and Competency Framework would be the
starting point of the Comprehensive Regional Teachers’ Policy. A Task Team to develop
the draft regional framework for teacher’s standards and competencies was approved by
Joint Ministers of Education and Training, Science, Technology and Innovation in June
2017.
SADC Qualification Framework
116. The SADC Qualification Framework (SADC QF) approved by Ministers of Education to
serve as a regional mechanism for comparability and recognition of full qualifications and
skills, credit transfer, creation of regional standards and quality assurance, was launched
by the Joint Ministers of Education and Training, Science and Technology at their meeting
in June 2017. The SADC QF is a reference framework with ten level descriptors and
quality assurance guidelines. A two-year Plan of Action for Accelerating implementation
of the SADC QF 2016-2018 focusing on advocacy and popularization of the SADC QF at
regional and national levels; alignment of National Qualification Framework (NQF) and
qualification system to SADC QF; alignment of national quality assurance systems with
Regional Quality Assurance Guidelines; establishment of Regional Verification Network;
and establishment and strengthening of Institutional mechanism for the implementation
of the SADC QF, was developed and is being implemented.
117. A Communication Strategy with the establishment of Social Media Platforms such as
Twitter and Facebook SADCQF account was developed to popularize and raise
awareness of the SADC QF to all stakeholders in the region. In addition, eight SADC
Member States (Botswana, Mauritius, Seychelles, South Africa, Zambia, Namibia,
Lesotho and Swaziland) have started piloting the alignment of NQFs and qualifications
systems to the SADC QF. A SADC Qualifications Verification Network consisting of
partners who verify national and foreign qualifications in all Member States was
established and has started to share information. This will contribute to the SADC mobility
statistics and to address the issue of valid equivalence of Degree/Diploma certifications.
Mainstreaming Care and Support for Teaching and Learning in the Education and Training
118. Phase 2 of the Care and Support for Teaching and Learning (CSTL) Programme
continued to be implemented by seven Member States (DRC, Malawi, Mozambique,
49

-----------------------Page 49 End-----------------------

South Africa, Swaziland, Zambia and Zimbabwe) that are direct beneficiaries of the
Project. These Member States have developed customized national models which
provide national objectives and standards of practice for implementing CSTL as a
national programme. These national models cover the delivery of core and
complementary services, including leadership and structures, material support,
infrastructure, safety and protection psychosocial support, food nutrition, health
promotion, HIV, Life Skills, Gender, water and sanitation. Furthermore, continuous
capacity building of teachers through in-service teacher programme and key
stakeholders on issues of sexual reproductive health, the new Life Skills Education
curriculum as well as safety and protection is on-going in Member States. A pre-service
teacher training programme that incorporates CSTL as core constructs for teachers is
being piloted in South Africa, Zambia and Swaziland.
Revision of the SADC Technical, Vocational, Education and Training Strategic Framework and
Programme of Action
119. An evaluation of the SADC Technical Vocational Education and Training Strategic
Framework and Programme 2012-2016 was undertaken to inform the revision of the
Strategy that will taken into account recently approved regional, continental and
international commitments requiring TVET interventions. A Draft Evalution Report of the
Strategy containing current policy reforms and programme of TVET was produced and
has yet to be validated. It highlighted significant progress in improving the relevance of
TVET to the needs of individuals and industry. In addition, Members are undertaking
current policy reforms and programme of TVET and are popularising skills development
among the youth through youth skill competition or commemorating the youth skills day,
in line with Council decision of August 2016. For example, Namibia undertook its first
Nation Skills Competion in September 2016. Botswana commemorated its Youth Skills
Day on the 31 July 2017.
3.4.2.2 EMPLOYMENT AND LABOUR
Profile of the SADC Labour Market: SADC Employment Report
120. A SADC Consolidated Employment Report was produced based on ten SADC Member
States national employment reports (the DRC, Madagascar, Malawi, Namibia,
Seychelles, South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe) using the
Minimum Labour Market Indicators. The report compares labour market indicators among
selected SADC Member States with 2014 as the base year. It covers aspects pertaining
to demographic characteristics, employment and unemployment, labour force, youth
employment and unemployment, conditions and quality of employment, social protection,
social dialogue, labour migration and skills mismatch. The demographic characteristic of
the SADC Member States consists of predominately a young population, with more than
50 per cent aged between 15 and 34 years, with a higher proportion of females than
males. Unemployment rate is higher for females than males in most Member States as
depicted in Figure 9.

121. Youth unemployment is an issue of concern in most SADC Member States. Youth
unemployment, especially for youth aged 15-24 years, is the highest among all the age
groups in all the reported SADC Member States. The common trend in the reported
SADC Member States is that there are more females in the category of youth not
employed or educated than males as shown in Figure 10.

122. The concentration of youth employment by industry varies according to countries.
Many youths in the SADC region are employed in the agriculture, trade and services
sectors.
Ratification Status of the Employment and Labour Sector Protocol
123. The Employment and Labour Protocol, approved and signed in 2014, is pending
ratification by two thirds of SADC Member States before implementation starts. To date
nine Members States have signed the Protocol and none have ratified. A draft report on
the assessment of the challenges encountered by Member States in the signing and
ratification of the SADC Protocol on Employment and Labour has been completed and is
yet to be validated. Member States will be expected to develop a Roadmap towards
ratification of the Protocol once the Report has been validated.
3.4.2.3 HEALTH AND PHARMACEUTICALS
124. The status of health in the region continues to be increasing mortality associated with a
high burden of both communicable diseases (such as HIV and AIDS, Tuberculosis and
Malaria) and increasing incidences of Non Communicable Diseases, of which the major
ones reported are Cancers, Cardio-vascular Diseases, Diabetes Mellitus and Chronic
Respiratory Diseases and emergence and re-emergence of diseases such Leprosy,
Anthrax, Ebola, Yellow Fever, Cholera and other Neglected Tropical Diseases.
125. Key achievements under the Health and Pharmaceuticals Programme include:
(i)

The Implementation Plan of the SADC Food and Nutrition Security
Strategy relating to Social and Human Development was developed and
approved, and UNICEF has seconded a Technical Expert to the
Secretariat to expedite the operationalization of the Strategy;

(ii)

The Common Technical Document for Registration of Medicines has
been adopted for the region, and the Zazibona Initiative for Collaborative
Evaluation of Dossiers for Registration of Medicines is utilizing the
updated Guidelines for Registration of Medicines;

(iii)

In line with a decision of Joint Ministers responsible for Health and HIV
and AIDS, an Expression of Interest has been developed to be circulated
to all Member States willing to Host the SADC Pooled Procurement
Services that will be managing information sharing and implementation
of the SADC Strategy on Pooled Procurement and Essential Medicines;

(iv)

The development of the Strategy for Regional Manufacturing of
Essential Medicines and Health Commodities in SADC (2016-2020) was
facilitated with technical and financial assistance from AfDB Project for
Control of Communicable Diseases and the Health Research for Action;

(v)

The commemoration of the 2016 SADC Malaria Day took place at the
border between Mozambique, South Africa and Swaziland under the
Theme: “Strong Cross border collaboration is key to Malaria Elimination”
and the Slogan: “SADC Unite to End Malaria”;

Lessons, experiences and emerging knowledge and technologies on Orphans, Vulnerable
Children (OVC) and Youth development and empowerment shared at regional and international
levels
126. The Project, "Strengthening Monitoring, Evaluation and Reporting Systems for OVC and
Youth in SADC", which is supported by the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation, was officially launched by SADC Senior Officials responsible for Youth on the
margins of the meeting of SADC Ministers responsible for Youth in Gaborone, Botswana
in June 2016. Member States were sensitized on the Project and offered to support its
implementation at national level.
127. Country visits to Namibia and Zimbabwe were undertaken to consult key national
stakeholders on the Project and the SADC Secretariat Monitoring, Evaluation and
Reporting (MER) in general; establish country specific MER of OVC and youth capacity
building needs; facilitate national planning and establishment of multi-sectoral
coordination mechanisms for the implementation of the Project; and identify existing
efforts, opportunities and resources available at national level on which project support
could be built upon for sustainability. These resulted in country specific MER of OVC and
youth capacity situation and needs identified; national plan and multi-sectoral
coordination arrangements agreed upon, and national contributions and partners to the
project established in these Member States.
Regional Youth Innovation and Entrepreneurship Framework and Implementation Plan developed
128. An inception Report of the Situational Assessment of Youth Innovation, Entrepreneurship
and Productivity was produced. The purpose of the Situational Assessment is aimed at
practical understanding and conceptualisation of youth empowerment centred on the
relationship between youth innovation, participation and leadership. It aims at identifying
existing policies, programmes (including financial support instruments) and sectoral
efforts in support of innovation, entrepreneurship and leadership development in public
and private sectors and civil society in the region. It will also provide baseline information
on youth innovation, youth participation and leadership, and youth entrepreneurship;
recommend specific priority areas for developing standards for youth participation and
leadership in socio-economic development; and recommend specific priority areas for a
SADC programme to support the youth to participate in the implementation of the Revised
SADC RISDP 2015-2020 and the Industrialisation Strategy and Roadmap 2015-2063.
Regional MER for youth database/information portal established
129. A Draft Monitoring and Evaluation Framework and detailed indicators for monitoring the
participation of youths in economic development has been developed, and is yet to be
validated.

3.4.3

CROSS–CUTTING PROGRAMMES

3.4.3.1 POVERTY REDUCTION
130. The Secretariat has been reviewing the work of the Regional Poverty Observatory (RPO)
in order to strengthen and render it move effective. In addition, assistance has been
provided to Member States in the harmonisation of standards, methods and common
poverty indicators. Currently, one of the immediate tasks is to produce a SADC common
definition of poverty, which will form the basis for collecting baseline data for the SADC
Regional Poverty Status Report as well as the development of a dashboard to monitor
poverty trends in the region. The development of the SADC Poverty Status Report
requires substantial amount of resources to cover all the 15 Member States, and the
Secretariat is working on securing financial resources for this important exercise.
131. The evolving nature of poverty has also placed demands on the Secretariat to spearhead
reforms and execution of measures for poverty reduction at the national level, through
adoption of the Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI), which was developed by the
Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative and subsequently adopted by the
United Nations. Member States are encouraged to adopt the MPI because it measures
poverty beyond the income factor alone, to include poor people’s experience of
deprivation, such as poor health, lack of education, inadequate living standard, lack of
income, disempowerment, poor quality of work and threat from violence.
132. The RPO, as a framework, is also working on providing the regional best practices to
supplement the benchmarks of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and allow
comparative performance analyses across the Member States. One of the immediate
tasks is to ensure that Member States have a platform to meet and peer review in their
implementation of the SDGs, share best practices as well as challenges, and encourage
one another to undertake National Voluntary Reviews.
3.4.3.2 COMBATING OF THE HIV AND AIDS PANDEMIC
133. HIV remains an urgent threat, with significant numbers of adolescents and young people,
predominantly females, still getting newly infected. Early and unintended pregnancy rates
among adolescent girls remain unacceptably high across the region, largely as a result
of low educational attainment and poor knowledge levels about HIV prevention; laws,
policies and attitudes that exclude adolescents and young people from accessing sexual
reproductive health care and HIV-related services; and gender-related barriers. High
rates of Gender Based Violence (GBV) continues to be cause for concern.
HIV prevention and social mobilization
134. Member States continued to implement a number of HIV prevention and social
mobilization activities. Using 2016 estimates and projections by UNAIDS based on
Member States data, the region experienced a decline in new HIV infections from
880,000 in 2010 to 763000 in 2015, a decline of 13.3%. The greatest decline in new HIV
infections occurred among children aged 0-14 years. One hundred and twenty thousand
(120,000) children aged 0-14 years became newly infected with HIV in 2010. This
declined to 43,000 in 2015 translating to a decline of 64.2%. The corresponding decline
among adults was 5.3%. The steep decline in new HIV infections among children is
largely attributed to the success of PMTCT programmes in all SADC Member States.
54

-----------------------Page 54 End-----------------------

135. Although declines in new HIV infections have been observed over time, the SADC Region
continues to be the global epicenter of HIV and AIDS. There is a concern over the high
levels of new HIV infections among adults which makes it difficult to sustain treatment
and also to eliminate mother to child transmission of HIV. Globally and also within the
SADC region, the pace of reducing new infections has declined since 2010, and in some
cases, there has been an increase in new infections, sparking fears of a rebound of the
epidemic. There is need for heavy investment in prevention if the Region is to contribute
to the end of AIDS by 2030 within the Sustainable Development Goals.
136. The main challenges in HIV prevention are related to low investment in prevention, lack
of focus on high impact programmes, failure to target groups and geographical areas,
failure to prioritize, poor quality services, as well as all insufficient scale of good practices.
If the SADC Member States are to meet the 2020 and 2030 targets for HIV prevention,
an extra ordinary effort will be required.
Prevention of Mother to Child Transmission (PMTCT)
137. The PMTCT programme is one of the most successful HIV and AIDS programmes in all
SADC Member States. Available data from Member States show that PMTCT coverage
(Percentage of HIV-positive pregnant women who received antiretrovirals to reduce the
risk of mother-to-child transmission) is high and there is only one Member State with
coverage below 60%. When this outlier is removed, PMTCT coverage ranged from 63%
to 95% (Figure 11).

AIDS Treatment
138. AIDS treatment programmes are being implemented in all SADC Member States.
UNAIDS estimates and projections (2016) estimated SADC Anti-Retroviral Therapy
(ART) coverage among adults aged 15 years and above at 22% in 2010 and 52% in
2015, an increase in 30 percentage points over a period of five years.
139. ART coverage among children aged 0-14 years was estimated at 25% in 2010 and 63%
in 2015, an increase of 38 percentage points in five years. These data show that ART
coverage among children has significantly increased.
140. Available data shows that Member States are at different levels in terms of their HIV
treatment programmes. Member States that have estimated life years gained by
implementing treatment programmes have demonstrated that there is return on
investment on this programme.
Impact mitigation
141. All Member States recognize that HIV and AIDS have negative consequences on the
population and render certain population sub-groups vulnerable. The groups that are
usually classified as vulnerable are orphans and vulnerable children (OVC), youth,
people with disabilities, and people living with HIV. Member States have designed and
implemented a number of interventions. Common ones include:
(i) Provision of grants and bursaries to facilitate education, especially of OVCs;
(ii) Provision of social cash transfer especially to OVC;
(iii) Provision of food and money for daily needs of vulnerable groups; and
(iv) Mainstreaming HIV and AIDS so that they are part and parcel of the daily
operation of all sectors.
142. These activities are part of the implementation of the National Programmes for OVCs
such as National Plans of Action for OVCs. A number of Member States have revised or
are in the process of revising or strengthening their Policies and Strategies for OVCs to
align them to the regional SADC Minimum Package of Services (MPS) for OVCs and
youth, and the Psychosocial Support (PSS) Framework.
143. Some sectors such as Education and Skills Training have integrated and mainstreamed
the SADC MPS and PSS Framework for OVCs by developing a Policy Framework for
Care and Support to Teaching and Learning, which also includes coordinating and
facilitating other basic services of OVC outside the mandate of education and skills
training. The SADC Food and Nutrition Security Strategy 2015-2025 recognizes the need
to pay special attention to food and nutrition security for orphans and vulnerable children.
SADC HIV and AIDS Cross Border Initiative
144. The Secretariat is implementing Phase 2 of the SADC HIV and AIDS Cross Border
Initiative (CBI) funded by the Global Fund for an amount of US$ 11,636,435. Phase 2 of
the CBI started in April 2015 and will end on 31 December 2017. The initiative aims to
reduce HIV infections in the SADC region and mitigate the impacts of HIV and AIDS on
Long Distance Truck Drivers (LDTDs), Sex Workers, and affected communities around
border areas with basic HIV and health services at selected high-volume border posts.

These services are provided at 32 Wellness Clinics that are specifically established for
that purpose (Figure 12). It is expected that all the 32 wellness sites would have been
handed over to Member States by December 2017 when the project ends.
Figure 12: Example of Wellness Clinic of the SADC HIV and AIDS Cross Border Initiative

145. The Wellness Centres, established in Phase 1 of the CBI (started in 2011 and ended 31
March 2015), have so far generated some encouraging results, including the following:
(i)

Percentage of sex workers reporting the use of a condom with their most
recent client has increased by about 18% during the period 2015/16;

(ii)

Percentage of Long Distance Truck Drivers (LDTDs) reporting the use of a
condom during their last sexual intercourse has increased respectively by
about 10% during the period 2015/16; and

(iii)

5468 LDTDs were reached with prevention package and an increased
counselling services and targeted approach with specific behaviour change
messages for LDTDs; and 97% of these took an HIV test and know their
status.

Intensifying Resource Mobilisation
146. Available data show that the HIV and AIDS responses in most of the SADC region, except
for three Members States, are from external sources. Furthermore, there is evidence that
the volume of external support to the HIV and AIDS programmes in the region is
declining.
147. Figure 13, showing the percentage of national budgets that were allocated to the health
sectors of SADC Member States in 2015, indicates that only two Member States
(Botswana and South Africa) managed to surpass and sustain the target of 15 percent
budgetary allocation. It is also important to note that some MS are experiencing declines
in the percentage of the budget that is allocated to the health sector. These data show
57

-----------------------Page 57 End-----------------------

that although external support to the HIV and AIDS response is declining, this remains
the lifeline for the sustenance of interventions. A number of Member States are exploring
options for increasing domestic support during the reporting period, including increased
role of the private sectors, mainstreaming HIV in the public sector, introducing various
forms of taxation and social insurance.

3.4.3.3 GENDER EQUALTY AND DEVELOPMENT
Revised SADC Protocol on Gender and Development and SADC Gender Protocol Monitoring,
Evaluation and Reporting Framework
148. The Revised SADC Protocol on Gender and Development adopted by Ministers
Responsible for Gender and Women’s Affairs was approved and signed by Summit in
August 2016. The Agreement Amending the SADC Protocol on Gender and
Development has so far been signed by nine (9) Member States namely, Angola,
Botswana, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Lesotho, Madagascar, Mozambique,
Swaziland, Tanzania and Zimbabwe.
58

-----------------------Page 58 End-----------------------

149. Following the review of the Protocol and its alignment to the United Nations SDGs and
the African Union Agenda 2063 as well as the Beijing + 20 Review Report, the SADC
Gender Protocol Monitoring, Evaluation and Reporting Framework (MERF) and relevant
tools for effective monitoring, evaluation and reporting on the implementation of the
Revised Protocol on Gender and Development was completed in 2016/17. The MERF
will be used by Member States for tracking and reporting on prioritized indicators based
on the agreed themes and reporting time frames.
Women in Politics and Decision Making Positions
150. SADC Member States continue to make notable progress towards representation by
women in politics and decision-making positions at various levels of governance,
although this falls short of the 50:50 target. Performance continues to be varied across
the region.
151. Most Member States show achievements towards gender parity in some parts of the
spectrum of governance, and the trend illustrates the limited but growing participation of
women in structures of power and decision-making. The status of progress made in
women’s representation in Parliament; Cabinet; Ambassadors; Local Government; Public
Sector and the Judiciary is illustrated below in Tables 5-7.

Sensitization on the SADC Gender Responsive Budgeting Guidelines
152. The SADC Gender Responsive Budgeting Guidelines, as approved by Council in 2014,
was operationalized through a joint Regional Workshop to validate SADC Monitoring and
Evaluation System and rolling out of the SADC Guidelines on Gender Responsive
Budgeting (GRB) in November 2016. The meeting recommended that efforts should be
made to enhance sensitization on the GRB guidelines targeting the National Statistical
Offices; Ministries responsible for Finance, Economic Development and Planning;
Central Bank Governors; and National Planning Entities. Plans are underway to sensitize
the Regional Parliamentary Caucuses during their meeting planned for October, 2017 in
collaboration with the SADC Parliamentary Forum.

Trafficking in Persons
153. In raising awareness and enhancing efforts to combating trafficking in persons in the
region, especially of women and children, key activities were as follows:
(i)

The Government of Zimbabwe, in collaboration with the Secretariat, the United
Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), and International Organisation for
Migration (IOM), commemorated the World Day against Trafficking in Persons on
29th July 2016, in Harare. The commemoration coincided with the launch of the
Zimbabwe Trafficking in Persons National Plan of Action (2016-2018), which
underscores the importance of a multi-sectoral response in the fight against
trafficking in persons;

(ii)

Training courses on trafficking in persons were conducted for law enforcement
officers and key service providers in the Republic of Malawi, the DRC, and United
Republic of Tanzania in October 2016, December 2016, and May 2017,
respectively. These training courses were conducted in collaboration with UNODC,
IOM and the Southern African Police Chiefs Cooperation Organisation
(SARPCCO);

(iii)

Country-to-country experiential learning between the Republics of Malawi and
Zambia was facilitated and that resulted in the development of Malawi’s Draft
National Plan of Action against Trafficking in Persons (2017-2022); and

(iv)

Support to the development of subordinate legislation (national strategic
frameworks and action plans) on trafficking in persons in the Republics of Angola,
Botswana and Malawi. It is anticipated that these frameworks and action plans will
be finalized and launched by the end of 2017.

Regional Strategy on Women, Peace and Security
154. In implementing the UNSCR 1325 on Women, Peace and Security and its associated
resolutions and Article 28 of the Protocol on Gender and Development on Peace Building
and Conflict Resolution, the Secretariat facilitated a consultative workshop in November
2016 to develop the Regional Strategy on Women, Peace and Security. The goal of the
SADC Regional Strategy on Women, Peace and Security is to ensure that women fully
and meaningfully participate in SADC’s peace and security structures and processes
through mainstreaming gender into the SADC’s Peace and Security Architecture.
United Nations SADC-Sponsored Resolution CSW60/2 on Women, the Girl Child and HIV and
AIDS developed and adopted
155. SADC has since 1999 consistently sponsored the UN resolution on women, the girl-child
and HIV and AIDS, which was submitted to the 60th Session of the UN Commission on
the Status of Women in March 2016, where it was adopted by consensus. Following the
adoption of the SADC Sponsored Resolution 60/2 on Women, the Girl Child and HIV and
AIDS, at the 60th UNCSW in March 2016, Ministers responsible for Gender and Women’s
Affairs directed the Secretariat to develop a regional programme to implement the
Resolution.
61

-----------------------Page 61 End-----------------------

156. The Secretariat convened a regional meeting in January 2017 to develop a Framework
and Programme of Action through a multi-sectoral consultative process leveraging on the
existing work within Member States, and targeting young women and the girl child in
relation to HIV and AIDS in the short and medium term.
Commemoration of 2017 International Women‘s Day
157. Departing from the past practice of commemorating the International Women‘s Day (IWD)
at SADC Secretariat Headquarters in Gaborone, Botswana, the 2017 IWD was
commemorated in Mazzini, the Kingdom of Swaziland on March 8 2017 under the theme
“Women in the Changing World of Work: Planet 50-50 by 2030”. The event was held at
Mavuso Trade fair Centre, and was graced by the Deputy Prime Minister, Senator Paul
Dlamini, as well as a number of SADC Ministers and International Cooperating Partners.
It has since been resolved that it would be a good practice for Gender Unit to rotate the
IWD commemoration and tie it to the prevailing SADC Chair. The commemoration also
profiled the Woman Farmer of the Year 2016; the Junior Achiever Africa Winner 2016
and the Swaziland Women Economic Empowerment Trust (SWEET) as best practices
for some of the programmes that are being implemented within the 2017 theme.
3.4.3.4 SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION
158. Two thirds of Member States have ratified the Protocol on Science Technology and
Innovation which has now entered into force.
Draft Regional Guidelines on Intellectual Property Rights
159. A draft SADC Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) Framework and Guidelines has been
developed and validated in partnership with the Trade sector. The draft Framework and
Guidelines were also considered by the 51st of the SADC Trade Negotiating Forum of
officials in experts in May 2017 and Joint Ministers meeting of Education and Training
and Science, Technology and Innovation in June 2017 respectively, where the
Secretariat was directed to consult widely with other SADC policy structures, since IPR
is cross-cutting. The draft Framework and Guidelines are intended to guide Member
States to strengthen national IPR management and systems to advance industrial
development, trade and competitiveness of the region.
Draft Regional Innovation and Technology Transfer Framework
160. A draft Regional Innovation and Technology Transfer Framework and Action Plan was
developed and validated by regional experts in March 2017, and was considered by the
Joint Ministers meeting of Education and Training and Science, Technology and
Innovation in June 2017, where the Secretariat was directed to do further work and
include issues pertaining to social and grassroots innovations taking into consideration
the large percentage of informal economies in the region. The aim of the draft Framework
and Action Plan is to support the development of regional capacities, capabilities and
infrastructure/s in the areas of innovation and technology transfer to advance industrial
development.

62

-----------------------Page 62 End-----------------------

SADC Charter on Women in Science, Engineering and Technology
161. The SADC Charter on Women in Science, Engineering and Technology was adopted by
the Joint Ministers meeting of Education and Training and Science, Technology and
Innovation in June 2016 and recommended it for legal clearance by Committee of
Ministers for Justice and Attorney Generals and approval by Council in 2017. The aim of
the Charter is to increase the participation of women in youth in the fields of science,
technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). One of the key barrier identified in
the Industrialisation Strategy and Roadmap is shortage of skills in STEM.
Regional research, innovation and technology transfer programmes established
162. Among the notable achievements in research, innovation and technology transfer was
the partnership with the Southern African Regional and Innovation Management
Association (SARIMA) with support of the Government of South Africa in the
implementation of a three-year programme on strengthening regional research and
innovation management capacities, which ended in March 2017. A number of research
managers were trained in the region in the areas of research and innovation
management, Intellectual Property Rights and Technology Transfer. An exchange and
mentorship programme for technology transfer professionals and researchers was
implemented involving 31 institutions in the region, 16 capacity building workshops were
held benefiting over 391 researchers, and a regional Database of research managers
was developed and is operational.
3.4.3.5 PRIVATE SECTOR
163. The Secretariat has continued to engage the Private Sector through the NEPAD Business
Foundation (NBF)’s Working Groups which were launched in April 2016. The focus of
this dialogue has been in areas of mining, pharmaceutical and agro-processing.
164. In its March 2016 meeting, Council, among others, directed the Secretariat to work with
the Private Sector to showcase existing and potential value chains during the
commemoration of the Industrialization Week in Swaziland. Subsequently, the first SADC
Industrialization Week was commemorated in Matsapha, Swaziland in the margins of
Council on 23-26 August 2016. It culminated into the Esibayeni Declaration which was
adopted by the 2nd Southern Africa Business Forum (SABF) and presented to the First
High Level Meeting between the captains of industry and the Ministers responsible for
Trade and Industry.
165. The Declaration, essentially calls for specific actions on how to develop infrastructure
required to catalyse industrialization, and to develop corridors in addressing issues
relating to trade facilitation, non-tariff barriers and movement of skills and innovation,
contains the following key messages:
(i) Hard and soft infrastructure shortcomings must always be addressed together;
(ii) Policy certainty, including stability, predictability, consistency and transparency,
is key for attracting investment for regional industrialization, regardless of sector
or scale;
63

-----------------------Page 63 End-----------------------

(iii) Project prioritization and sequencing is the key to successful implementation;
and
(iv) Enabling trade through the removal of non-tariff barriers, coordinated border
management and a solid regional transit system is a prerequisite for
industrialization in all sectors.
166. As part of the operationalisation of the Esibayeni Declaration, the Secretariat is in the
process of securing support to undertake the following activities during 2018/19:
(i) Reviving the SADC Mining Ministers’ Committee to act as the counterpart to
Mining Industry Association of Southern Africa (MIASA). This Committee will
help coordinate simultaneous provision of soft and hard infrastructure within the
mining sector. The Secretariat will coordinate the annual meeting of the SADC
Mining Ministers Committee;
(ii) Development of an advocacy plan of action towards harmonisation of regulations
across different sectors in Member States; and
(iii) Development of ‘softer’ regulatory and compliance procedures for small miners
to incentivise their ‘legal’ participation in the industry.
167. The next Industrialization Week will take place on the margins of Summit in August 2017
in South Africa.
3.4.3.6 STATISTICS
168. The SADC Statistics programme continued to strengthen measures for compilation and
dissemination of quality comparable regional statistics for the region. Emphasis was
placed on collection, verification and validation of data before transmission to Secretarait
for compilation, and the following key outputs were achieved:
(i)

Selected indicators for 2016 were compiled. These indicators are useful for,
among other, assessment of the economic perviormance of the region, and
include macroeconomic variables or statistics of the Real, External and
Monetary Sectors and comprise the Gross Domestic Product (GDP),
Inflation, Trade, Debt and Foreign Exchange Reserves, Population and
Exchange Rates;

(ii)

SADC Statistical Yearbook 2015 was compiled, validated and uploaded
onto the SADC website to promote wider circulation. It provides data time
series and summaries of statistical information pertaining to SADC for
period 2000-2015 on a wide range of subjects, including economy and
finance; population; health; education and training; labour market; living
conditions and social protection; industry, trade and services; agriculture,
forestry and fisheries; international trade; transport; environment; energy;
and science and technology; and

(iii)

Monthly SADC Harmonised Consumer Price Indexes news releases were
produced and disseminated. The news releases are used for assessing,
among others, compliance of Member States in the convergence criteria to
64

-----------------------Page 64 End-----------------------

monitor progress towards integration. They are also useful for regional
monetary policy dialogue and formulation.

169. The Secretariat undertook the initiative to assist Member States to establish and
strengthen the SADC National Committees (SNCs) following the decision of Council to
have this exercise done in accordance with the provisions of Article 16A of the SADC
Treaty. In this regard, with the support from GIZ, there were Scoping Studies undertaken
in the Republic of Zambia and United Republic of Tanzania, and the results of these
studies were discussed with stakeholders in national workshops that were convened in
these two Member States. Support was also rendered to the Republic of Malawi and the
Republic of Botswana during the Orientation Workshops for new members of the SADC
National Committees. There is planned engagement with the Republic of Botswana to
undertake a Scoping Study, while the Republic of Malawi requested for two workshops
to disseminate regional development instruments to the various stakeholders.
170. Following the establishment of the SADC Platform for the National Planning Entities, the
Platform has had meetings to assist in the implementation of the Revised RISDP 20152020, as well as ensure that there are proper mainstreaming and synergies of the
regional development frameworks into the National Development Plans. The SADC
Platform has also been involved in the establishment of the Online Results-Based
Monitoring and Evaluation system, which requires development of capacities at the
Member State level.
171. One of the key achievements relating to strategic planning was the convening of the
SADC Strategic Ministerial Retreat, on the theme: “The SADC We Want”. The
organisation of the Ministerial Retreat was the implementation of a decision of Council in
March 2016, where Council noted the need for a special strategic session, at Ministerial
level, to examine the current state of affairs in SADC, the pace and level of the integration
agenda, constraints and challenges, prospects and how to fast-track the SADC
integration agenda.
172. The Strategic Ministerial Retreat was held on 12-14 March 2017 in the margins of the
Extraordinary Summit in March 2017 in Ezulwini, Swaziland. The Secretariat facilitated
the preparation of five (5) concept papers which were developed by identified institutions
on the following topic: SADC Vision, Progress, Challenges and Prospects; SADC
Institutional Capacity to Deliver on its Mandate; and Sustainable Financing for Regional
Integration. The Ministerial Retreat was also informed by five (5) lead statements from
Ministers on the same topic.
173. The Ministerial Retreat made observations and recommendations on the above topics,
and it produced an outcome document, the “Conclusions of the SADC Strategic
Ministerial Retreat”, which was approved and endorsed by Council and Summit,
respectively, in March 2017. In order to operationalise all the decisions of Council and
Summit on the Ministerial Retreat, the Secretariat is in the process of developing an
implementation plan and roadmap. To that end, the decisions of Council and Summit
have been categorised into four (4) Thematic Areas, and four (4) Thematic Teams have
been established to work with the Secretariat to produce Thematic Implementation Plans
65

-----------------------Page 65 End-----------------------

and Roadmaps, which will then be consolidated and presented to Council at its next
meeting.
174. An account of the on-going work to strengthen the monitoring, evaluation and reporting
and other functions at the Secretariat is provided below in section 9.0.

6.2 SADC-EU POLITICAL DIALOGUE
13. Political Dialogue is one of the main pillars of the Cotonou Partnership Agreement
signed by the European Union (EU) and the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) Group
of States in 2000. The SADC-EU Political Dialogue was launched at the SADC-EU
Ministerial Conference in Berlin, Germany, in September 2004 (This conference, also
75

-----------------------Page 75 End-----------------------

referred to as the Berlin Initiative, resulted in the adoption of the Berlin Declaration). For
SADC, it is intended to establish a platform for high level dialogue with a view to supporting
democracy at all levels, promoting cooperation in trade and encouraging policies aimed
at sustainable economic growth and economic reforms in the two regions.
14. The two sides hold Senior Officials’ Political Dialogue once annually and the Ministerial
Political Dialogue once every two years, alternating between the EU and SADC Regions.
The last Ministerial Political Dialogue was held in Luxembourg in October 2015. The
Senior Officials’ Political Dialogue was held in October 2016, focusing on Peace and
Security, and in November 2016, focusing on Economic Cooperation and Partnership.
15. A Senior Officials’ Dialogue was held in June 2017 in preparation for the Ministerial
Dialogue to be held during the last quarter of 2017. The Dialogue has been instrumental
in identifying common areas of interest between the two sides, highlighting opportunities
and challenges, as well as policy and programme level responses and interventions.
6.3 SADC/GERMANY COOPERATION
16. Germany remains a major partner for SADC. The total volume of bilateral Technical and
Financial Cooperation (respectively through GIZ and KfW) provided by the Federal
Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ) since cooperation began in
1995 exceeds €341 million. Germany provides further support to the SADC Regional
Integration Agenda through its contributions to the EDF by virtue of its membership to the
European Union. It also continues to cooperate bilaterally with SADC Member States and
other sub-regional and national SADC institutions.
17. Within the context of the Windhoek Declaration (2006) and other international
commitments on Aid and Development Effectiveness, Germany actively participates in the
SADC-ICP Partnership Dialogue and is the lead ICP for the SADC-ICP Water Thematic
Group.

6.4 SADC – WORLD BANK COOPERATION
19. The World Bank continues to support the implementation of SADC programmes mainly
through support to individual Member States under bi-lateral cooperation and also at
regional level through cooperation with the SADC Secretariat. Subsequent to the
consultative meeting the Secretariat had with the World Bank Executive Director
responsible for the Africa Group in March 2017, it was proposed that the Secretariat should
participate in the 2017 Spring Meeting and explore opportunities for enhanced cooperation
with the World Bank, to negotiate and lay the basis for a programme to support
infrastructure in SADC, particularly in the following areas:
(i) Institutional framework support for packaging of projects identified by the
Regional Infrastructure Development Master Plan;
(ii) Investment opportunities in the already bankable projects;
(iii) Support for the implementation of the SADC Industrialisation Strategy and its
Action Plan; and
(iv) Support for the implementation of the Regional Agricultural Policy and Plan.
20. Following a proposal from COMESA in 2016, it was proposed that a joint meeting be
arranged between the World Bank and Tripartite RECs (SADC, COMESA and EAC) in the
margins of the 2017 Spring Meetings to discuss ways of improving coordination and
77

-----------------------Page 77 End-----------------------

harmonization of cross regional programmes on regional integration. The objective of the
meeting was to bring together the three RECs and the World Bank to review the status of
the Tripartite programmes and World Bank support to regional integration in the subregion, and explore ways to accelerate their implementation through better coordination
between the RECs on one side and enhanced support of the World Bank and other
Development Partners on the other.
21. The World Bank IDA active portfolio of regional projects to support regional integration in
SADC amounts to US$1.8 billion for 10 projects in transport, energy, ICT, and agriculture.
6.5

SADC – CHINA COOPERATION
22. The Secretariat attended the sixth Ministerial meeting and the Johannesburg Summit of
the Forum on China–Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) in December 2015. During the
Johannesburg Summit, the Chinese government announced some US$60 billion of
funding support to Africa over the next three years. The Johannesburg Summit of FOCAC
adopted the Declaration and Action Plan outlining the actions to be undertaken over the
next three years, including a follow-up mechanism to facilitate monitoring.
23. The FOCAC Action Plan (2016–2018) outlines cooperation in political, economic, social
development, cultural and security areas. The following is included under economic
cooperation: industry partnering and industrial development capacity; infrastructure
development; energy and natural resources; investment and economic cooperation; trade;
agriculture and food security; ocean economy and tourism. These areas of cooperation
are in line with the SADC priorities, as outlined in the Revised RISDP 2015-2020.
24. As a way forward, and in a bid to operationalise the Johannesburg Summit FOCAC
Declaration and Action Plan, the Secretariat is in consultation with the Chinese
government and negotiating a Framework Agreement on Economy, Trade, Investment
and Technical Cooperation between SADC and the Government of the People’s Republic
of China.

6.6

SADC – JAPAN COOPERATION
25. As a follow-up to the policy level dialogue between the SADC Secretariat and the
Government of Japan in November 2015, the Secretariat is in the process of engaging
with Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) to concretize the proposal for the
appointment of a Japanese Technical Advisor for the Directorate of Infrastructure and
Services to facilitate access to the Tokyo International Conference on African
Development (TICAD) Resources on infrastructure development. The proposal is to
support SADC in the priority areas outlined in the Revised RISDP 2015-2020 and the
RIDMP, in line with the TICAD V for accelerating economic growth in Africa, and as
outlined in the Yokohama Action Plan 2013-2017.
26. It is worth noting that Japan is also already supporting a regional project on Forest
Conservation and Sustainable Management of Forest Resources in Southern Africa
through a grant of US$6.4 million, mainly for technical assistance which includes expertise
in Forestry.

78

-----------------------Page 78 End-----------------------

6.7

SADC – AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK COOPERATION
27. The AfDB continues to provide support for the implementation of programmes in the SADC
region through bi-lateral cooperation with individual SADC Member States and
cooperation with the Secretariat for regional programmes. In this regard, the Secretariat
engaged the AfDB at both technical level and policy level to explore cooperation in the
context of the Bank’s High Five Initiatives in line with the SADC regional priorities, as
outlined in the Revised RISDP.
28. A Breakfast Meeting between SADC and Executive Directors representing the SADC
Region at AfDB was held in March 2017 in Swaziland in the margins of the SADC Summit,
to discuss priority areas of cooperation between SADC and AfDB; institutional matters;
mechanism of cooperation; and how to address challenges experienced in execution of
AfDB funded programme. The meeting suggested that AfDB should be able to tap into
potential resources globally, for example, the Green Climate Fund, which provides funding
for climate-change mitigation. In order to advance this agenda further, the Secretariat
participated in the Annual Meetings of AfDB in May 2017 in Ahmedabad, India, and
facilitated a side-line meeting of SADC Ministers of Finance and the President of AfDB.
29. In line with one of the decisions of Council on the SADC Ministerial Retreat which was
held in Swaziland in March 2017, the Secretariat is working with AfDB to develop the
necessary instruments and frameworks, such as Infrastructure Bonds, Partial Risk
Guarantees, Insurance Guarantees and Partial Credit Guarantees, for use in Member
States; and on how to leverage on the AfDB Industrialization Strategy.
6.8 SADC – ICP DIALOGUE PLATFORM
30. In line with the Windhoek Declaration (2006) on New Partnership between SADC and
International Cooperating Partners (ICPs) to convene biannually SADC/ICP Dialogue
Platform meetings, the last meeting of the SADC/ICP Dialogue Platform was held in
October 2016. The meeting discussed progress in the implementation of SADC
programmes and activities as contained in the Revised RISDP 2015-2020 and how to
better align ICPs support to SADC priorities.
31. As outlined in the adopted SADC-ICP Partnership Statement and Generic Terms of
Reference for the Platform and Thematic Groups, engagement with ICPs has also
continued through Thematic Group Coordination meetings where the Secretariat meets
with interested ICPs working in specific sectors to facilitate information sharing, ensure
effective utilisation of resources and minimise duplication of support programmes.

7.

GOOD GOVERNANCE

7.1

RISK MANAGEMENT
1. Risk Management continues to be an important pillar of governance for the Secretariat,
and Management has continued to promote and support effective enterprise-wide risk
management, by setting up oversight structures to monitor implementation of the risk
management policy. Directorates and Units continue to review and update their risk
profiles to ensure impacts and likelihood of risks are proactively mitigated, while potential
opportunities are explored further where possible.
79

-----------------------Page 79 End-----------------------

2. The major strategic risks identified for the Secretariat for the financial year have remained
the same as the previous year:
(i) Failure to promote sustainable and equitable economic growth and socioeconomic development due to non-compliance with regional commitments by
member states
(ii) Inadequate priority setting resulting in non-achievement of set targets
(iii) Multiple memberships to different regional economic organization impede SADC
regional economic integration
(iv) Unsustainable and inadequate funding for SADC regional integration agenda
(v) Inadequate organizational performance management system
(vi) Lack of critical mass to drive the core business of SADC Secretariat.
3. In order to mitigate these risks, action plans were developed with timelines, and progress
on implementation of the action plans has been monitored throughout the year. After the
development of the SADC Business Continuity Policy, which was approved by Council in
March 2016, the Secretariat is now in the process of developing a Business Continuity
Management Plan, to ensure seamless transition and continuity during disasters,
emergencies and or any unexpected interruptions to the operations of the Secretariat.
7.2 AUDIT
4. The Secretariat continued to collaborate and support all structures charged with the
responsibility of overseeing and undertaking audit of activities of the SADC Secretariat.
These structures, which include the Council of Ministers, Audit Committee, External and
Internal Auditors, continued to provide guidance, assurance and opinion on all audit
related matters aimed at enhancing internal controls environment and reliability of financial
statements.
5. The Secretariat also continued to implement recommendations from both external and
internal audits as well as the institutional audit in order to bring improvements in the
management systems of the Secretariat, in particular strengthening of the internal control
environment. The effectiveness of the control environment allowed the Secretariat to
continue benefiting from ICP resources through contribution agreements and projects.
6. The Executive Secretary is committed to supporting all structures charged with a
responsibility of guiding the Secretariat on matters relating to governance and oversight.
This will ensure improvement of the management systems to meet international standards
so that governance principles are upheld in the management of the affairs of the
Secretariat.

IMPLEMENTATION OF FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK

Overview
1. Budget and Finance controls within the Secretariat are carried out within the Financial
Management framework, which are intended to deliver an effective and efficient risk
advisory service and support the Secretariat to fulfill its fiduciary responsibility. Financial
regulations, standing orders and rules for the management of the affairs of SADC are
enacted by the Council of Ministers under Article 30 of the Treaty of SADC. These provide
80

-----------------------Page 80 End-----------------------

a consistent and comprehensive legal framework for Financial Management. As required
by financial regulations, budget execution and oversight control is aimed at achieving,
among others, adherence to good corporate governance principles; and ensuring that risk
management measures, including the SADC risk management policy and framework, are
in place.
2. In terms of reporting and auditing control, under Article 15 (h - i) of the Treaty, the
Executive Secretary is required to prepare and submit to the Council, the following:
(i) Annual Reports on the activities of SADC and its institutions;
(ii) Annual Budget of SADC for submission to Council; and
(iii) Annual Audited Accounts of SADC for submission to Council.
3. The Secretariat’s financial statements are compiled in compliance with International Public
Sector Accounting Standards, which was approved by Council in 2012 as a financial
reporting framework for the organization.
Review of Results for 2016/17 Financial Year
4. Results for 2016/17 financial year, reflected in the SADC Secretariat audited International
Public Sector Accounting Standards compliant financial statements, show the following:
(i) Operating surplus of US$ 6.1 million (US$11.8 million in 2015/16) on:
(b)
(c)
(d)

Revenues of US$ 57.3 million (US$78.6 million in 2015/16);
Member States contributions of US$ 39.7 million (US$51.6 million in
2016/17); and
Grants of US$17.0 million (US$27 million in 2015/16), which were
recognized as contributions based on the SADC Secretariat’s
compliance with conditions, as specified in each financing
agreement.

(ii) Total assets under the control of SADC Secretariat of US$ 97.5 million
(US$101.1 million in 2015/16), financed as follows:
(a) Member States (Reserve; Asset Replacement; Staff Loan and
Accumulated funds): US$ 43.8 million (US$37.7 million in 2015/16);
(b) Member States – differed revenue: US 8.3million (US$6.5 million in
2015/16);
(c) Grants – differed revenue: US$ 8.7 million (US$13.0 million in 2015/16);
(d) SADC House loan: US$23.6 million (US$25.9 million in 2015/16); and
(e) Payables (staff gratuity; staff grievances; Organ mission to Lesotho
refunds to Member States; and suppliers): US$18.0 million (US$10.5
million in 2015/16).
5. The results show decreasing contributions from Member States (27%) and declining
grants (37%). This is explained as follows:

81

-----------------------Page 81 End-----------------------

(i)

Significant contributions from Member States in 2016/17 relate to activities
of the Organ on Politics, Defense and Security Cooperation. Other
contributions remained unchanged from the 2015/16 financial year; and

(ii)

Grants considerably declined in 2016/17 reflecting expiry of a number of
activities and projects funded by International Cooperating Partners, without
replacement agreements from the AfDB and European Union.

6. Overall, the SADC Secretariat achieved a budget utilization rate of 64% in 2016/17
(compared to 80% in 2015/16). 230. The overall utilisation of the budget is presented
according to the various programmes and corporate services in Figure 14, showing that
the overall utilization was 81% and 53% for Member States and ICPs funds, respectively.

7. The main explanations for the observed utilisation of funds in the implementation of
regional programmes and projects are:
(i)

(ii)
(iii)
(iv)

Inadequate planning, where:
(a) planned outputs are not commensurate to human resources, resulting in
postponement of activities;
(b) outputs and activities are included in annual operational plans when funding
has not been fully confirmed and timely disbursement guaranteed; and
(c) appropriate mechanisms are not put in place for disbursing project funds to
Member States;
Lack of quorum resulting in postponement of planned meetings;
Budgeted goods and services for various activities were taken care of by host
Member States and co-partners;
Delays experienced in replenishment of funds on projects and continued lengthy
process over procurement on projects; and

A number of positions budgeted for in 2016/17 were not filled-up throughout the
year.

SUMMARY OF IMPLEMENTATION CHALLENGES AND RECOMMENDATIONS
1. The effective implementation of SADC programmes and projects at the regional levels
continues to be affected by challenges in planning and programming; monitoring,
evaluation and reporting; project management; financial and human resources; and
computerization and ICT systems. In line with various directives of Council, the Secretariat
continues to implement a number of reforms to address these problems as well as
deficiencies in internal processes in order to improve efficiency and effectiveness of its
operation. To date, key measures taken by the Secretariat include:

(i) Strengthening the operationalisation of the planning, and monitoring and
evaluation functions to address reported deficiencies in planning, programming,
monitoring, evaluation and reporting. Positions for planning and monitoring are
included in the approved SADC Secretariat Organisational Structure;
(ii) Improvements in planning, programming and budgeting, whereby starting from
2017/18 all outputs have been broken down into quarterly milestones/targets to
improve tracking and accountability. Furthermore, only outputs whose funding
has been confirmed are included in the annual operational plans, and this applies
to both Member States and ICP funded programmes. This addresses the
challenge of having inadequate funds for various outputs;
(iii) Development of an online monitoring, evaluation and reporting system to enable
real-time tracking of performance, documentation of results and facilitate
evidence-based decision-making and learning. A computerized system was
developed and approved by Council in March 2017, and is being rolled out at
regional and national levels. The system focuses on physical and financial
monitoring of annual work plans, strategies, policies and projects, and is expected
to play an important role of giving early warning signs on areas not performing
according to plan.
(iv) development of a SADC Project Management System with a view to addressing
project management challenges across the entire project management cycle
(Design, Implementation and Monitoring). Project management instruments have
been developed, and this function has been mainstreamed in the revised
Organizational Structure, as approved by Council in March 2017. A pilot is ongoing using TRF and REIS Programmes.
(v) Improvement of the SADC Secretariat Performance Management System
through strengthening of procedures and tools leading to a performance system
that is properly linked to the delivery of approved work plans and budgets;
(vi) Review of the SADC Secretariat Organizational Structure, which was approved
by Council in March 2017. The recruitment process is ongoing, with a plan to fill
the vacant positions starting from September 2017; and

83

-----------------------Page 83 End-----------------------

(vii)Automation of ICT systems in order to address challenges such as long
procurement cycle times, quality data and information access, increased risk and
compliance liability and systems integration. Such systems include: the new
Procurement Management System which went live on 01 April 2017, and is
integrated with SADC Integrated Management System (SIMS) and Sun Systems;
the new Performance Management System, which is expected to be completed
by January 2018; and the Electronic Records Management System, which is
expected to be live in November 2017.
2. In order to build on the above reforms to address the identified challenges, including the
lack of visibility of SADC, the following are recommended in the short to medium term:
(i) Continue improving planning and programming, and monitoring, evaluation
and reporting processes to ensure effective implementation of programmes
and project at both national and regional levels;
(ii) Strengthen negotiations between all parties to ensure that projects and
programme estimates are aligned to SADC priorities and fiscal year, and that
funds are disbursed on time;
(iii) Improve recruitment frameworks to ensure that vacant positions are promptly
filled in line with the approved SADC Secretariat Organizational Structure;
(iv) Continue providing assistance to Member States to strengthen the SNCs as a
way of ensuring that there are adequate coordination measures and capacities
for the implementation of SADC programmes and projects; and
(v) Ensure that the ways in which the Secretariat communicates to SADC
audiences be as relevant and engaging as possible, especially as new
technologies are giving SADC audiences more control over when and how they
access information.

CONCLUSIONS
1. This Report has highlighted the main developments in the area of regional cooperation
and integration in the SADC region in 2016/17, the second year in the implementation of
the Revised RISDP 2015-2020. In addition to an overview of the political and economic
situation in the region for 2016/17 and an outlook for 2017/18, the Report provides a
comprehensive account of the achievements in pursuing industrial development and
furthering market integration; putting in place strong foundations to support infrastructure
development in the region; supporting Member States in the maintenance of peace and
security at regional and nationals levels; tackling the negative effects of natural disasters;
and improving regional bases for the provision of better services in areas such as
education, health and HIV and AIDS.
2. A considerable number of developments have also taken place at the administrative and
operational levels within the Secretariat. It is anticipated that the new Organisational
Structure, which was approved and has now been operationalised will improve the
efficiency and effectiveness of the Secretariat in delivering on its mandates and fulfilling
the requirements in the implementation of SADC programmes and projects. It is also
intended that the SADC Project Management System, which is currently being rolled out
84

-----------------------Page 84 End-----------------------

will boost project management at all levels, thus leading to enhanced results in line with
SADC strategic priorities.
3. The Secretariat will continue to forge ahead in the coming months with efforts to increase
SADC’s ability to mobilise funds to support its programmes and projects that benefit all
Member States. Work will also be intensified to improve processes for interacting with
Member States, and with external partners locally, regionally and internationally, so as to
establish more efficient working links with all parties. Additionally, effort will also be
invested in disseminating user-friendly information about SADC more widely so that
greater numbers in the region are aware of the work done by SADC on their behalf.
