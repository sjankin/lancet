to have grown by 3.7 percent             from 2.1 percent in 2016. In the short term, growth
                                         is projected to accelerate to 4 percent in 2019 and

1 | THE DRIVE FOR AFRICA'S DEVELOPMENT




Africa has the world’s fastest growing
population. The continent’s young labor force is
projected to grow at an average rate of 2.75 percent
a year between 2016 and 2030, so an inclusive and
pro-employment growth path is crucial to creating
enough jobs. In addition, the adverse impacts of
climate change, now pronounced, are projected to
become even starker by 2050, undermining Africa’s
agricultural performance and water and energy
security.
These challenges call for significant investment
and external funding, involving the private sector,
particularly in regional infrastructure development

The Bank’s Board approved the Non-Sovereign Operations
(NSO) Policy in September 2018. The NSO policy provides
the framework for the Bank, through its private sector lending
window, to provide financing or investments without sovereign
guarantees to private and public entities that meet specific
eligibility requirements on non-concessional terms. The
objective is to help accelerate the continent’s transformation
by offering various financial support mechanisms and products,
including loans, lines of credit, guarantees, blended finance,
equity investments, and trade finance. The Bank’s engagement
in selected NSOs will help scale up financing for the Bank’s High
5 priorities, with the aim of maximizing the catalytic impact of
its limited resources, while seeking to promote inclusive growth
and the gradual transition to “green growth” in its RMCs.

Appendix 9:
Standing Committees of the Boards

Board effectiveness and welfare: The Committee on Administrative Matters Concerning the Board (AMBD)
In 2018, the AMBD considered reports from consultation missions and study tours, with outcomes providing strategic input into
the development of the new Regional and Country Strategy Frameworks and an evaluation of the development impact of the
ongoing decentralization. In addition, the AMBD reviewed a number of instruments designed to enhance Board effectiveness,
including a Board handbook and manual. Under the guidance of the committee, the 2018 Board Retreat convened under two
themes: “Private Sector Engagement” and “The Positioning of the Bank Relative to Other Multilateral Development Banks.” The
retreat aimed to prioritize areas for greater private sector involvement in the Bank Group’s interventions and identify ways that
the multilateral development bank system can act as a catalyst for change.

Accountability and risk management: The Audit and Finance Committee (AUFI)
In 2018, AUFI provided oversight and monitoring of the implementation of audit recommendations, the administrative budget,
the 2018 Lending Program, Special Operations Unit Portfolio, Group Risk Management, Capital Adequacy and Exposure reports,
and market risks. AUFI also reviewed and cleared the work plans of independent accountability units reporting to it, including the
Office of the Auditor General and the Office of Integrity and Anti-Corruption.

Staff welfare and corporate efficiency: The Committee on Administrative and Human Resource Policy Issues (CAHR)
In 2018, CAHR provided strategic guidance on internal administration of justice to enhance the rule of law and accountability, and
advised the Boards on a long-term strategy for acquiring and managing real estate for Regional and Country Offices. CAHR also
oversaw a review of the Staff Pension Scheme in order to enhance its long-term sustainability. Further, it reviewed a new draft of
the Bank Group’s People Strategy and provided considerable input.

Focus on results and impact: The Committee on Operations and Development Effectiveness (CODE)
In 2018, CODE reviewed and provided input into draft Country Strategy Papers for Congo, Côte d’Ivoire, Equatorial Guinea,
Guinea, Liberia, Malawi, Mozambique, Niger, São Tomé and Príncipe, and South Africa, as well as an updated Country Strategy
Paper for Nigeria. CODE sought to align these instruments with each country’s socioeconomic development priorities, em-
phasized inclusion as well as selectivity, and addressed climate change, fragility, gender mainstreaming, regional integration,
economic diversification, and engagement with the private sector. In addition, it reviewed and cleared the work plans of indepen-
dent accountability units reporting to it, including independent development evaluation and compliance review and mediation.

Client orientation and stakeholder management: The Committee on External Communications and Preparation of
the Bank Group Annual Meetings (ECAM)
In 2018, ECAM provided strategic guidance that led to the successful convening of the Annual Meetings of the Bank Group in
Busan, Korea. Further, ECAM provided direction toward preparing the Bank Group Annual Report 2018 and the African Economic
Outlook 2018.

Fostering an ethical culture: The Committee for the Enforcement of the Code of Conduct for Executive Directors
(ECBD)
In 2018, ECBD successfully resolved one matter referred to it.

Cost effectiveness and efficiency: The Committee of the Whole on the Budget (CWHOLE)
In 2018, CWHOLE conducted mid-term and end-of-year reviews of the performance reports on implementing the budget and
the work program. It also reviewed and shaped the strategic orientations for the three-year budget framework paper and work
program for 2019–21, for consideration by the Boards.
