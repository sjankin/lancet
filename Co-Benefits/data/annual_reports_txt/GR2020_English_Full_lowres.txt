GLOBAL
REPORT
2020

The High Commissioner for Refugees is mandated by the United Nations
to lead and coordinate international action for the worldwide protection
of refugees and the resolution of refugee problems. Its primary purpose
is to safeguard the rights and well-being of refugees. In its efforts to
achieve this objective, the Office strives to ensure that everyone can
exercise the right to seek asylum and find safe refuge in another State,
and to return home voluntarily. By assisting refugees to return to their own country or to settle
permanently in another country, UNHCR also seeks lasting solutions to their plight.
UNHCR’s Executive Committee and the UN General Assembly have authorized involvement
with other groups. These include former refugees who have returned to their homeland,
internally displaced people, and persons who are stateless or whose nationality is disputed.
The Office seeks to reduce situations of forced displacement by encouraging States and
other institutions to create conditions which are conducive to the protection of human rights
and the peaceful resolution of disputes. In all of its activities, it pays particular attention to the
needs of children and seeks to promote the equal rights of women and girls.
The Office carries out its work in collaboration with many partners, including governments,
regional organizations, and international and non-governmental organizations. It is committed
to the principle of participation, believing that refugees and others who benefit from the
Office's activities should be consulted over decisions which affect their lives.

And how important those pledges and
reforms were.
When COVID-19 hit, most States found
practical solutions to enable protection
from persecution and from the pandemic.
Some States, particularly in Africa, worked
closely with UNHCR to ensure they could
uphold their international legal protection
obligations to even large influxes of
refugees, while shielding their own citizens
from the disease. Their leadership and
solidarity have been exemplary.

An unprecedented response
in an unprecedented year

UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi meets refugee children from Ethiopia at Hamdayet border reception centre in Sudan.

If you have no reserves to fall back on,
you have no resilience in a crisis. When the
COVID-19 pandemic shocked the world
in 2020, refugees and other people of
concern to UNHCR were among the most
vulnerable. For them, the most basic advice
was often impossible to follow:
“Don’t travel.” “Stay at home.” “Keep your
distance.” “Get tested.” “Wash your hands
frequently.” “Study or work online.”
COVID-19 meant UNHCR’s mission to
protect and assist refugees was suddenly
mired in an unprecedented emergency,
and in a context where travel was difficult
and physical contact all but impossible.
The borders refugees must cross to reach
safety were abruptly closed to stem the
spread of the disease. Forcibly displaced
people risked being excluded from the
COVID-19 response, impoverished, evicted,
unfed and unable to travel to seek safety
or return home. Resettlement, already

4 U N H C R G LO B A L R E P O R T 2 02 0

straining to keep pace with a historic
decade of displacement, was squeezed
further by the pandemic, with the fewest
departures since 2002. There were fears
for a worsening of the plight of stateless
persons.
And yet, UNHCR had started 2020 on a
positive note. The international community
had come together for the first Global
Refugee Forum in December 2019, making
more than 1,400 pledges that would put the
Global Compact on Refugees into operation,
a manifestation of the whole-of-society
approach to respond to forced displacement.
UNHCR had also completed its
regionalization and decentralization
process, a significant component of an
ambitious reform agenda. It aimed to
improve delivery, giving more authority
to the field while maintaining and
strengthening risk management and
appropriate controls.

Alongside our international, national and
local NGO partners, UNHCR stayed and
delivered vital protection activities and
services and, critically, bolstered host
State health systems and provided cash
assistance, shelter and other support to
help mitigate the most immediate impacts
of the pandemic on the displaced and
host communities.
Yet COVID-19’s impact has gone far beyond
health and has driven millions of refugees
into deeper poverty and despair. Often
reliant on daily wage jobs or informal
employment, they were among the first
to lose out in lockdowns, with poverty
rates amongst refugees soaring. And the
consequences have been grave, especially
for women and children. Gender-based
violence has increased, as has domestic
violence and early child marriage. Refugee
children, especially girls, were already less
likely to attend school than their host
counterparts, had less access to remote
learning opportunities, and are less likely
to return to school after the pandemic.
Mental health needs have grown faster
than the response can manage.
While COVID stopped many things, it did
not stop conflict. Old conflicts persisted or
even reignited and new ones erupted,
increasing the number of displaced as the
year went on. Brutal killings were meted
out in Mozambique. Conflict, which
included sexual violence, engulfed Tigray
in Ethiopia. The scourge of gang violence
in parts of Central America drove more

people–including children—into exile.
The people of the Sahel continued to be
plagued and persecuted by conflict and
climate change, forcing more and more
away from their homes.
UNHCR and partners were determined that
the pandemic would not stop them
protecting and assisting record numbers
of forcibly displaced and stateless people
around the world, with by year’s end more
than 91.9 million people of concern—
refugees and asylum-seekers, returnees,
IDPs, and stateless persons. And despite
the challenges of conflict, the pandemic
and paralysis on political progress on most
conflicts, UNHCR has continued to search
for solutions so that men, women and
children can stop living in a state of
uncertainty and instead make the most of
their potential. For example, at the behest
of South Sudan and Sudan and under the
stewardship of IGAD, the Intergovernmental
Authority on Development, UNHCR is
developing a solutions strategy that could
help resolve displacement for up to
7 million people in and from the two
countries. This has the potential to end
the plight of millions of people, but it needs
the support of the international community
to strengthen peace and security efforts
and provide resources to develop the
countries, including areas where the
displaced will live.
Despite the global economic challenges
brought on by COVID, solidarity with and
for refugees persevered. The major host
governments, themselves often relying on
fragile health systems, did not hesitate to
include refugees in their health responses.
Donors funded a large percentage of our
COVID-19 response and, led by the
United States of America, Germany and
the European Union, responded with
an unprecedented overall financial
contribution to our budget of over
$4.7 billion, including generous levels of
unearmarked funding from donors such
as Sweden, España con ACNUR, and the
United Kingdom.

This was an unprecedented response to
an unprecedented year and helped us
carry out our mandate around the world.
This support also steadied our resolve to
see through our ambitious reform agenda.
The pandemic forced acceleration in a
number of areas, including streamlining
processes and partnerships to enable
greater flexibility and improved delivery
of assistance. And the global uprising
against racism and social justice gave us
pause and prompted reflection on our
own shortcomings and biases, unconscious
or not. This led to sometimes painful, yet
necessary, internal discussions on race
equality and inclusion within UNHCR. To
address the issues raised, and building on
work on the prevention of sexual exploitation
and abuse and sexual harassment, we
launched agency-wide discussions, hired
external experts to guide us, and developed
an interim plan of action to make UNHCR
a better, more inclusive agency which will
undoubtedly make us a better champion
of refugees and the displaced.
Despite the many achievements of 2020,
there are unfortunately more forcibly
displaced people than ever and their needs
are greater. The additional hardship
brought by COVID-19, the lack of political
progress on resolving conflicts, combined
with funding shortfalls for UNHCR and
other humanitarian agencies, compounds
their suffering. Ending wars and rebuilding
peace would allow many millions to fulfil
their dreams of going home. Yet even a
fully-funded UNHCR would only be able
address a portion of these needs, and
humanitarian funding windows are not
6 U N H C R G LO B A L R E P O R T 2 02 0

adequate or sufficiently predictable for
the response that is required.
This is why the underpinnings of the
Global Compact on Refugees must be
implemented in response to today’s
displacement crises. There must be greater
inclusion—not only in the health response
and vaccinations, but in other social
services and the socioeconomic response.
In designing and implementing financial
rescue packages, host countries need to
include refugees to prevent further hardship
and suffering, and donor States must ensure
hosts are properly resourced to allow them
to continue to extend the protection and
support needed to refugees, the displaced
and the communities that host them.
And we need greater support elsewhere,
including crucially in the area of vaccine
equity to avoid a world divided by
inoculated and infected, ultimately leaving
no one safe from a resurgence of the
virus. I appeal in the strongest terms to
those States with resources and capacity
to do more to share vaccines and logistical
support so that all people, including
refugees and their hosts, can be protected
from the virus.
The COVID-19 pandemic also reminds us
of the importance of prevention and
preparedness. Clearly this applies to future
pandemics, but it must also be applied to
prevent and resolve conflict and address
the climate emergency, which threatens
us all and from which no country alone
can protect its population.
If it has taught us anything, I trust this year
has taught us all that the gravest threats
to our health and safety—whether it be
a pandemic, the climate emergency or
conflict—require multilateral cooperation
and action to address and resolve.

The World Bank and international
financial institutions took drastic measures,
including rapidly providing around
$1 billion of grants instead of loans for
refugee-hosting countries. The private
sector, including contributions from
innovative Islamic financing mechanisms,
contributed $537.5 million and shared
its valuable expertise to improve our
worldwide response.

The Special Envoy
At its heart, UNHCR’s mission is about
compassion and humanity. That simple truth
is easily drowned out by the din of social
media or lost in political arguments. In the
Special Envoy of the UN High Commissioner
for Refugees, Angelina Jolie, UNHCR has a
high-profile champion whose inspiring and
focused advocacy can cut through the noise
and bring the conversation back to solutions
for refugees.
On World Refugee Day, in an article for Time
magazine, she urged Americans to look
beyond borders and see the fight for rights
and equality as universal, and asked
governments to work towards durable
settlements to the world’s conflicts. The
article cited UNHCR data on displacement,
while an accompanying video helped
spotlight the plight of refugees in Bangladesh
and Myanmar, with UNHCR staff briefing the
Special Envoy on day-to-day challenges they
encounter. She addressed the UN Security
Council on sexual violence against children,
highlighting Iraq’s Yazidi minority and
challenging Member States to do more for
survivors. At a UNHCR-UNICEF roundtable,
co-hosted by Canada and the United
Kingdom, she urged governments to invest
in educating refugee children.
Although COVID-19 made travelling almost
impossible, the Special Envoy remained
informed and engaged, making a virtual

in December and learning about the
challenges that both the displaced and
UNHCR staff on the ground are battling
on daily basis, and speaking to UNHCR
field officers in the Bolivarian Republic
of Venezuela about the impact of the
pandemic on their work.
Separately, during a virtual design
competition and fashion show organized
by UNHCR’s Kenyan partner RefuSHE,
the Special Envoy reunited virtually with
a Congolese refugee she had met three
years before and who had since been
resettled to the United States of America.
In October, the Special Envoy joined U.S.
Representative Chrissy Houlahan for an
online conversation on combatting genderbased violence, and the following month
she addressed the Republic of Korea’s
conference on Action with Women and
Peace, demanding an end to impunity
around sexual violence in conflict. Her
poignant op-ed in the Financial Times
invited readers to consider the context
and complexity of UNHCR’s work, and to
support refugees with respect and
understanding as well as donations.

(2) Includes refugees who have returned to their place of origin during 2020. Source: country of origin and asylum.
(3)Includes IDPs who are in IDP-like situations.
(4) Includes IDPs protected/assisted by UNHCR who have returned to their place of origin during 2020.
(5) Refers to persons who are not considered as nationals by any State under the operation of its law. This category
refers to persons who fall under the agency’s statelessness mandate because they are stateless according to this
international definition, but data from some countries may also include persons with undetermined nationality. The
figures reported include stateless persons who are also counted as refugees, asylum-seekers, IDPs or others of
concern to UNHCR. UNHCR’s statistical reporting generally follows a methodology that reports only one legal status
for each person of concern. However, due to the extraordinary size of the displaced stateless population from
Myanmar, UNHCR considers it important to reflect the dual status of this population group as both displaced and
stateless. Additional stateless refugees, asylum-seekers, and IDPs will be reported on as UNHCR continues to review
and improve its reporting on stateless persons with a dual status.
(6) People of concern to UNHCR not included in the other categories but to whom UNHCR may extend its protection
and/or assistance.
(7)Venezuelans displaced abroad refers to persons of Venezuelan origin who are likely to be in need of international
protection under the criteria contained in the Cartagena Declaration, but who have not applied for asylum in the
country in which they are present. Regardless of status, Venezuelans displaced abroad require protection against
forced returns, and access to basic services. UNHCR and the International Organization for Migration work together
with this population by leading the Regional Inter-Agency Coordination Platform, which is aimed at strengthening
the protection dimensions and consistent responses across the region in line with human rights standards.

GLOBAL STRATEGIC PRIORITIES
2020-2021
The Global Strategic Priorities (GSPs) for the 2020-2021 biennium set out areas targeted by UNHCR to enhance protection
for people of concern and find solutions for them. The GSPs are divided into two categories: “operational priorities” for field
operations and “support and management priorities” for core organizational functions. The operational priorities influence
the development and implementation of country-level plans by field operations. The GSPs are in line with the 2030 Agenda
for Sustainable Development and reflect UNHCR’s 2017-2021 Strategic Directions and commitments made at the World
Humanitarian Summit, including under the Grand Bargain.
This year for the first time, the Global Strategic Priorities are fully integrated into the Global Report, and reporting on UNHCR’s
achievements and challenges across all GSP areas in 2020 can be found in the thematic chapters of the Global Report.

OVERVIEW

BUDGET

This chapter presents an overview of
UNHCR’s budget, expenditure and income
in 2020. More detailed information can be
found on Global Focus, UNHCR’s main
operational reporting platform.  

At its 70th session in October 2019,
UNHCR’s Executive Committee approved
an original global needs-based budget for
2020 of $8.668 billion. At its 71st session in
October 2020, the Executive Committee
approved a revised budget of $9.131 billion
based on updated assessed needs.

UNHCR’s final 2020 budget was
$9.131 billion, having increased from the
2020 original budget of $8.668 billion.
The increase was the result of two
supplementary budgets totalling
$463.7 million which were added during
the year. 
Expenditure totalled $4.838 billion leading
to an implementation rate (expenditure
over total funds available) of 89.5%. Taking
total funds available over the final budget,
the funding gap was 41%. 
Global Strategic Priorities
Mobilization of support
See p. 17 for GSP result

Total funds available to UNHCR reached
$5.404 billion, comprising voluntary
contributions of $4.722 billion, carry-over
of $410.9 million, $40.1 million from the
Regular Budget of the United Nations,
and $229.8 million from other income
and adjustments.

That budget represented the sum of the
approved original budget of $8.668 billion
and two supplementary budgets of
$463.7 million. It comprised programmed
activities of $8.721 billion (including
management and administration costs
at Headquarters, covered in part by
the United Nations Regular Budget
contribution); an operational reserve of
$395.4 million; the “new or additional
activities – mandate-related” reserve
of $2.5 million; and $12 million for Junior
Professional Officers. 
When compared with the 2019 budget
of $8.636 billion, the final 2020 budget
of $9.131 billion represents an increase of
$495.4 million or 5.7%, mainly reflecting
the response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Supplementary budgets  
With COVID-19 the overwhelming
priority for response, two supplementary
budgets were issued for the COVID-19
pandemic ($404 million) and in support
of the refugee and displacement crisis
in the central Sahel region ($59.7 million).
The financial requirements for these
budgets were $463.7 million or 5.3%
of the total budget for programmed
activities ($8.721 billion).
With reference to the financial requirements
for 2020 programmed activities of
$8.721 billion, these increased by
$562.5 million or 7% compared to 2019. 
Globally, Pillar 1 (global refugee
programmes), was the largest component
of the programmed activities, at 77%.
The largest requirements under Pillar 1
were in the Middle East and North Africa
for operations in Lebanon ($607 million)
and Jordan ($427 million); in the East
and Horn of Africa and the Great Lakes

in Ethiopia ($346 million), and Uganda

($284 million). 
The second largest component of
programmed activities was Pillar 4
(global IDP projects), at 15% of requirements,
where the major operations continued to
be in the Middle East and North Africa,
specifically in Iraq ($328 million) and the
Syrian Arab Republic ($210 million).  
Regionally, the largest requirements were
in the Middle East and North Africa and
in the East and Horn of Africa and the
Great Lakes regions, at $2.813 billion,
or 32%, and at $1.901 billion or 22%, of
total requirements for programmed
activities respectively. This is reflective
of a series of protracted and overlapping
crises in these two regions.

2019 final expenditure

By region 
Increases in expenditure were recorded
in all regions (see Chart 3). This was
mainly attributable to the response to
COVID-19, but also to new and growing
displacement crises including those in
the Sahel, in northern Mozambique,
and in Ethiopia’s Tigray region.
East and Horn of Africa and the Great
Lakes | Expenditure grew by $68 million
or 9%.
The increase included Sudan for the
emergency in Ethiopia, providing
assistance to some 55,000 refugees
from Tigray. Over 6 million people
accessed health care services and
benefited from organized information
campaigns about COVID-19. UNHCR
also disbursed $30.2 million in
cash assistance to 1 million people
of concern.

2020 final expenditure

Southern Africa | Expenditure grew by
$3 million or nearly 2%.
The conflict in Cabo Delgado in northeast Mozambique saw UNHCR increase
its support to some 530,000 displaced
people. Across the region, some 1.4 million
people of concern received protection
services, and 261,400 received cash
assistance to mitigate the impact of
COVID-19.  
West and Central Africa | Expenditure
grew by $113 million or 34%.
Major increases were in Burkina Faso,
Mali, Niger and Nigeria. In response
to the emergency in the Sahel, some
154,000 people received shelter
assistance, and almost 80,000 households
received core relief items. UNHCR
biometrically registered more than
1.2 million people across the region,
and over 1 million people received health
care services. 

The increase was spread across the
region, with the most significant growth
in Colombia, Ecuador, Guatemala, and
Honduras. In Colombia, UNHCR supported
an additional 64,000 displaced people
through protection monitoring, advocacy,
outreach and assistance, and supported
access to asylum through innovative
technologies in Ecuador. With continued
forced displacement in the north of
Central America, UNHCR supported
government reception facilities in
Honduras and provided assistance
and protection at border locations
in Guatemala. Cash assistance in the
region supported some 374,000 people. 
Asia and the Pacific | Expenditure grew
by $56 million or 15%.
Increases included Myanmar and
Pakistan. Some 1.4 million refugees, IDPs
and other people of concern accessed
protection services and 797,561 people
received cash assistance to mitigate the
impact of COVID-19. In Bangladesh,
Malaysia, and Thailand, UNHCR supported
community-based organizations and
reinforced community networks. With
conflict-related internal displacement in
Afghanistan, Myanmar, and the
Philippines, UNHCR advanced datadriven protection and solutions for IDPs.
UNHCR worked to reduce and prevent
statelessness, supporting legal and policy
reforms, particularly in Central Asia,
where the nationality issues of an
estimated 34,600 people were resolved.  
Europe | Expenditure grew by $12 million
or 2%.
The main increase was in Greece, where
UNHCR worked with the Government to
quickly identify and move people at high
risk of COVID-19 to safer accommodation
under the “Emergency Support to Integration
and Accommodation programme”.
Throughout the region, in response to

the pandemic, UNHCR advocated the
inclusion of people of concern in national
health responses, vaccination campaigns
and social protection schemes, and some
520,383 vulnerable refugees and asylumseekers received cash assistance   
Middle East and North Africa |
Expenditure grew by $100 million or 8%.
The increases were mainly in Jordan,
Lebanon, Libya, and Yemen, with
COVID-19 exacerbating already
precarious humanitarian situations in the
region. UNHCR supported national health
capacities so that people of concern
could be supported through national
systems. Across the region, 5.2 million
people benefited from community
outreach services, while 2.6 million
women and girls accessed information on
protection risks and services. Large-scale
distribution of emergency core relief
items continued in Libya, Syria, and
Yemen, where more than 50 million core
relief items were distributed. UNHCR
provided support to over 30,000 survivors
of gender-based violence with psychosocial
counselling, legal and medical assistance
into the national social welfare system.
Global programmes | Expenditure grew
by $24 million or 5%. 
The main increases were in the Division
of Information Systems and Solutions
for investments in cyber security,
replacement of obsolete equipment,
and in the Business Transformation
Programme; and in Executive Direction and
Management due to the strengthening of
the Enterprise Risk Management 2.0 in field
operations and the creation of a small
liaison office for the regional bureaux.
Headquarters | Expenditure decreased by
$23 million or nearly 10%.  
All regions recorded a slight increase
of expenditure due to the new regional
bureaux having been relocated from
Headquarters to the field.

The Office worked closely with other
UN agencies, most notably within the
framework of the UN Partner Portal,
to harmonize procedures, including on

The RRPs evolved from emergency
responses to more comprehensive
responses strengthening livelihoods and
resilience. A key lesson from the 2020
response was the need for RRPs to
integrate new health and socioeconomic
needs arising from the COVID-19
pandemic within the humanitarian
responses, in particular for situations
where underlying vulnerabilities were
already exacerbated by conflict and
violence. Understanding the different
dynamics of climate change on

UNHCR funded $211.2 million of
expenditure from indirect support costs,
$161.5 million at Headquarters and
$49.7 million to the regions. Earmarked
voluntary contributions funded 59% of
UNHCR operations’ expenditure, while
softly earmarked and unearmarked
voluntary contributions funded 13%
and 10% respectively. The largest
expenditures funded from earmarked
voluntary contributions were in the
Middle East and North Africa, followed
by the East and Horn of Africa and the
Great Lakes, and Europe at 39%, 20%
and 13% respectively. No unearmarked
funding was used for Headquarters.
Throughout the year, UNHCR’s
programmes were carried out in an
environment of sound financial
accountability and oversight. Financial
management at UNHCR Headquarters
and in the field was strengthened, and
adequate internal control infrastructure
was in place. For example, the launch of
a PowerBI tool allowed offices to access
and monitor local and regional financial
data in real time. The Statement of
Internal Controls was published for
the first time in 2020 for 2019, and
the groundwork started for the 2020
issuance.
It introduced standardized selfassessment of local internal controls,
allowing global reporting. UNHCR
prioritized COVID-19-relevant guidance

and published procedures on electronic
signatures and mitigating measures for
the pandemic. Committees on Contracts
(CoCs) operated remotely, with
emergency procedures in various
locations and an e-submission tool for
CoCs was developed for 2021.
Accounts were recorded in full
compliance with IPSAS. However, due
to the pandemic, the external audit was
forced to shift to a virtual model. UNHCR
adjusted and finished the closure of the
2019 accounts, supporting the audit, and
ultimately obtained an unqualified opinion
on its financial statements. The fieldwork
for the 2020 audit was supported virtually
with results expected in 2021.
Cash assistance was also supported
by a robust financial control framework
and business processes embedded
in the delivery system. Cash assistance
amounting to $695 million (compared
to $646 million in 2019) was provided
with oversight and expertise in financial
and risk management and in review
of financial policy and associated
procedures for cash assistance
implementation. Monitoring of cash
assistance with operations included
assessment and due diligence of global
financial ecosystems, and validation of
accessibility of financial service provision
meeting requirements in mobile and
digital money. UNHCR also supported
the digitalization and delivery of new
payment mechanisms and modalities,
further enhancing secure and direct
delivery of cash assistance to directly
reach the global financial ecosystems
and people of concern.

INCOME
Including funds raised for implementation
beyond 2020, UNHCR raised $4.736 billion
in voluntary contributions, a record level.
With the assessed contribution of the
UN Regular Budget of $40.1 million,

total contributions came to $4.776 billion.

Overall funding from donors giving over
$20 million—the $20 Million Club—
increased by 5% in 2019 and by 11% in
2020. More than half of the increase was
from the United States Government alone
($266.4 million, a 16% increase). Other
notable increases among top donors
came from CERF ($58.2 million, 119%),
Germany ($56.4 million, 14%), and the
European Union ($49.1 million, 14%). Taken
together, funding from the EU and its
Member States came to $1.613 billion.
Ireland and Spain both increased their
level of contributions to surpass the
$20 million level in 2020 (to $22.3 million
and $21.2 million, respectively), while
Austria significantly increased its
contribution from $3.6 million in 2019 to

Qatar remained a strong partner,
increasing its contributions by 16% to total
$23.8 million in 2020. This is in contrast
to an overall decline in contributions
from the Gulf region. Kuwait decreased
the most, from $20.1 million in 2019 to
$3.6 million (an 82% decrease), dropping
out of the $20 Million Club. Saudi Arabia
declined 16%, from $37 million to

Contributions from the CERF increased
significantly to $107 million (a 119% increase)
while country-based pooled funds

Contributions from development funding
sources decreased $45.5 million (22%)
from $246.3 million in 2019 to
$200.8 million in 2020.

Unearmarked
funding
Contributed without
restrictions on its
use. It provides
UNHCR with
vital flexibility in
determining how
best to protect and
assist people of
concern who are in
the greatest need or
at the greatest risk.

Softly earmarked
funding
Allows UNHCR to
allocate resources
across a range
of countries and
activities in a given
region or situation,
or a specific Pillar,
theme or activity
in accordance with
identified priorities.

Earmarked
funding

Tightly earmarked
funding

Contributions for
a specific country
without any

Also includes
contributions for
the response to an

Levels of earmarking (see Chart 8) in 2020
remained similar to 2019, in line with an
overall trend of increased earmarking in
funds provided to UNHCR. At $1.376 billion,
flexible funding—which comprises

Multi-year
funding
Pledged for 24 months

not all multi-year
funding is flexible,
the value of this type
of contribution is its
predictability, allowing
UNHCR to apportion
resources where they
are needed most at the

“Sweden’s multi-year, unearmarked contributions to UNHCR are intended to be flexible,
predictable and timely, helping UNHCR to be agile in responding to new emergencies, supporting
refugees in forgotten and underfunded situations, and fully funding a wide range of programmes across
the globe. We have confidence that the flexible funding provided is directed to where the needs are
greatest, making our contribution as impactful as possible for the displaced populations and host
communities we support through our partnership with UNHCR. As a leader in the provision of unearmarked
funding over many years, we encourage UNHCR to continue to expand its base of unearmarked
contributors and invite other donors to follow our example.”

SPOTLIGHT: The United States—collaboration in the face of
emergencies

TOTAL FLEXIBLE

The United States continued its strong support to UNHCR’s operational reserve
by providing a record $94 million towards its Reserve Pledge for Emergencies. This flexible
funding allowed UNHCR to respond swiftly to a rising series of emergencies, particularly
during the last quarter of 2020, while also meeting the needs of the COVID-19 pandemic.
In particular, support from the United States allowed UNHCR to immediately respond to
the outflow of tens of thousands of people into Sudan from Tigray. The operation in Sudan
was thus able to deploy critical resources along the border with Ethiopia to meet the dire
humanitarian needs by ramping up infrastructure such as reception, registration, and
transportation, providing urgent assistance such as shelter and healthcare, and life-saving
protection such as family reunification and support for victims of gender-based violence.

Multi-year funding is another measure
of flexibility and predictability for UNHCR
operations (see Chart 11). It reduces the
negative impact of income fluctuations
throughout the year which can have
knock-on effects across all areas of
UNHCR operations, from emergency

supply chains, staffing capabilities in the
field, and core operations. UNHCR was
able to draw on close to $618 million in
multi-year funding in 2020. Of particular
note are the multi-year contributions
from Belgium and Sweden, respectively
98% and 91% unearmarked.

Softly earmarked funding, which can be
used across a range of countries and
activities in a given region or situation,
came to $715.5 million (an increase of
$118.3 million from 2019). At 15% of
contributions received, this was a 1%
increase from 2019. Softly earmarked
contributions funded 13% of total field
expenditures. At the regional level, the
largest expenditure funded by softly
earmarked contributions were in the East
and Horn of Africa and the Great Lakes
($139 million or 16%), followed by West and
Central Africa ($106 million or 24%) and

Middle East and North Africa ($99 million or
7%) and Southern Africa ($56 million or 28%).
Softly earmarked funding is used especially
in countries affected by emergency
situations. In 2020, over $10 million in
softly earmarked funding was used in
Bangladesh, Burundi, Cameroon, the
Central African Republic, Chad, the
Democratic Republic of the Congo,
Ethiopia, Iraq, Jordan, Kenya, Niger,
Nigeria, Pakistan, South Sudan, Sudan,
the Syrian Arab Republic, the United

2020 was a record-breaking year for
UNHCR’s private sector fundraising.
Together with its National Partners,
UNHCR raised an unprecedented
$537.5 million, including over
$256.4 million in unearmarked funding.
This was an overall 28% growth in income
compared to 2019, exceeding 2020’s
ambitious fundraising target of
$500 million.
After a period of rapid growth in private
donor income for UNHCR and peer
organizations in 2015-2017, there was
stabilization in 2018 and a challenging
year in 2019. Although a downturn was
expected in 2020 due to COVID-19,
private sector fundraising picked up and

34 U N H C R G LO B A L R E P O R T 2 02 0

all regions and all income streams
performed above plan and above 2019
results. Despite the evident difficulties in
2020 with face-to-face fundraising, the
number of UNHCR’s individual donors
increased from 2.4 million to 2.8 million
and the final total income from individuals
reached $340 million. Income from
corporations, foundations and private
philanthropists came to $198 million,
an unprecedented 37% of the total
private sector income and a 69% increase
over 2019 income from the same
donor segment.
Growth in 2020 was driven largely by a
swift response to emergencies such as to
COVID-19, the crisis in Idlib, the explosion

While COVID-19 shifted fundraising
priorities, it also provided new angles of
approach to donors, and the pandemic
ultimately led to increased solidarity and
an interest in exploring new ways of
partnering with UNHCR, with $52 million
raised for the pandemic response.
Performance in channels such as direct
response television (DRTV), direct mail
and digital marketing increased, and
digital income reached $90 million,
30% growth compared to 2019.
Corporates, foundations and private
philanthropists also stepped up in larger
numbers and contributed 69% more than
in 2019. UNHCR received the largest
in-kind donations to-date from GAP Inc.
($22.7 million), Unilever ($19.6 million)
and Inditex ($7.6 million), with the single
largest individual donor for the second
year in a row being H.E. Sheikh Thani Bin
Abdullah Bin Thani Al-Thani.
Global campaigns raised over $15 million.
UNHCR successfully piloted Connecting
Worlds, a mobile application and
ecosystem to raise funds for cash
assistance. Developed based on insights
from refugees and donors, the app was
tested in four countries, where it proved a
successful engagement and fundraising
product. Step with Refugees, a new
iteration of "2 Billion Kilometres to Safety",
launched as a virtual month-long peerto-peer challenge asking participants to
seek sponsorship to complete a refugee’s
journey distance. The campaign will help
establish community fundraising for

UNHCR. The Ramadan campaign raised
$8 million globally. Aiming Higher
launched in December 2020, raising over
$1 million in its first week to fund refugee
scholarships. CTP, a leading industrial
European property developer, was the
first large contributor to the campaign and
generously funded 70 scholarships for
four years. The winterization campaign
brought in $5.34 million in digital revenue,
exceeding its target of $5.1 million with
three months left of the campaign.

UNHCR’s National Partners
UNHCR continues to maintain positive,
strategic relations with its nine National
Partners. In 2020, a new National Partner
was established in Switzerland, whereas
UNO-Flüchtlingshilfe marked its
40 th anniversary and achieved the best
result so far in its history. España con
ACNUR remained the largest contributor
with a record $103 million transferred
to UNHCR.
Australia for UNHCR | Despite the impact
of the bushfires, Australia for UNHCR
recorded significant increases of income
across individuals and middle-and
high-net worth donors. Emergency
appeals were launched for COVID-19,
Ethiopia, Lebanon and the Syria crisis.
The annual World Refugee Day breakfast
featuring UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador
Cate Blanchett was a virtual event
and attracted a record attendance of
750 people. In its 20 th anniversary year,
Australia for UNHCR launched the Leading
Women’s Fund, a unique community
of dynamic and passionate women
committed to supporting refugee women
and girls through donations and the
Connecting World app. In October 2020,
the cause-related marketing campaign
Design for a Cause was launched with
Australian online graphic design platform
Canva, to support refugee education.

Refugees on World Music Day which
reached over 30 million people with
25 celebrities supporting the campaigns
and more than 200 positive impacts in
the media.
Japan for UNHCR | Despite COVID-19,
donations from individuals and private
sector donors increased significantly.
One-off donations increased by more
than 50% compared to 2019, and regular
giving from new and existing individual
donors by 36% and 27% respectively.
Donations from companies, organizations
and high-value individuals also increased
91% year-on-year, including a gift for
the COVID-19 response from Sony
Corporation. Communication activities
including the invitation of a refugee
athlete to Japan, and the online music
and cinema event UNHCR WILL2LIVE,
attracted new audiences.

Sweden for UNHCR | There was a very
positive outcome in 2020, mainly in
response to emergency appeals for
the Moria fire, the Sahel, Idlib, COVID-19
and Ethiopia. The Moria fire in particular
saw the Swedish public respond
generously and quickly, resulting in
the highest private fundraising in Europe
with over $500,000 raised in a
few weeks.
Switzerland for UNHCR (CH4U) | This
new partner was established in March
2020. Several new strategic partnerships
were developed with philanthropists
and foundations while the first individual
campaign was launched in December
2020, reaching 100,000 households
with encouraging results.
UK for UNHCR | Another recently
-established National Partner created in
mid-2019 that become fully operational in
2020, it contributed $5.5 million in 2020,
mostly from key partnerships, including
a $3.9 million contribution from a joint
Unilever-UK Government fund for
COVID-19 response.
The charity also raised some $100,000
from individual giving donors. This was
in addition to nearly $10 million that
individuals in the UK donated to UNHCR
in 2020 before the charity was fully
operational, particularly for COVID-19,
Yemen, winterization, the Beirut
explosion, the Moria fire, the Democratic
Republic of the Congo, and other
emergencies.

UNO-Flüchtlingshilfe (Germany) |
Celebrated its 40 th anniversary by
raising 24% more than in 2019. COVID-19
forced the rescheduling of several
fundraising activities and a new focus
on successful mailing, telemarketing
and digital channels. Existing donors
remained loyal, and emergency
communication exceeded all expectations.
In honour of the anniversary, partnerships
were initiated with prominent figures in
arts and culture such as the pianist and
conductor Daniel Barenboim and the
theatre director Johan Simons. An
innovative nationwide art lottery, HEART,
was organized and raised 1 million euros
for UNHCR, thanks to the participation
of over 100 artists committed to raise
awareness for refugees and connect with
new and existing donors.
USA for UNHCR | Despite the challenges
of 2020, USA for UNHCR closed the year
with its highest revenue to date thanks to
its strong foundations and relationships.
A partnership with Gap Inc., with an
additional donation from Citizens of
Humanity, launched a transformational
gift-in-kind programme that provided
more than 6 million pieces of clothing.
Throughout the year, the voices of
refugees in the United States were lifted
up, bringing Americans together to
advocate for and support refugees.
In the face of so many unique workplace
challenges created by the pandemic,
culture and connection were prioritized,
and USA for UNHCR was named a
Great Place to Work.

Gap Inc. and Inditex make a landmark donation
in 2020 of $30.2 million worth of new clothing
to UNHCR operations
Thanks to generous contributions from Gap Inc. and Inditex,
two of the world’s largest fashion retailers, nearly 7 million units of clothing
were donated to refugees in Armenia, Burkina Faso, Lebanon and Rwanda.
Brokered by UNHCR’s National Partners USA for UNHCR and España
con ACNUR, the in-kind gifts represent more than one third of the annual
global demand for clothing and are two of the single biggest new clothing
donations to date for UNHCR. Valued together at nearly $60 million over two
years, these partnerships also created a more sustainable model to support
the achievement of SDG12 on responsible consumption and production.

COVID-19
The COVID-19 pandemic tested the ability
of UNHCR and partners to protect and
assist people of concern in ways never
before seen in its 70-year history,
highlighting the importance of strategic
collaboration, responsibility sharing, and
the inclusion of forcibly displaced people
in national responses.
The pandemic preyed on the vulnerabilities
of forcibly displaced women, men, girls
and boys. It blocked access to territory,
jeopardized livelihoods and endangered
54 U N H C R G LO B A L R E P O R T 2 02 0

the lives of those without equitable
access to health care. UNHCR adapted to
stay and deliver, an achievement made
possible by the dedication of its staff,
particularly those in field locations, as well
as by its emergency response capacity,
its pre-pandemic investments in forging
strong protection partnerships with
communities, its partnerships, and, most
importantly, the strength and resilience
of displaced communities themselves.
The pandemic forced tough decisions
about reallocating funds towards the most
urgent needs, such as life-sustaining

From the beginning, UNHCR’s response had
to deal with myriad challenges. Many people
of concern were in areas where health
systems were already struggling, capacity
for COVID-19 testing, isolation and treatment
was limited, and tracing and quarantining
difficult. UNHCR urged governments to
include refugees, the internally displaced
and stateless in their pandemic responses
and supported national health systems to
increase capacity. It adapted programmes to
ensure continuity in reproductive health and
HIV services, chronic diseases and mental
health. UNHCR constructed or rehabilitated
isolation and treatment facilities for local
hospitals, built governments’ and partners’
capacity for surveillance, contact tracing
and case management, and supplied
personal protective equipment (PPE),
medicines, oxygen and rapid testing
kits. Despite global shortages and the
near-collapse of global transport links,
UNHCR procured $186.1 million of critical
COVID-19 supplies, PPE and services,
and 9.9 million people of concern
received essential health care.
Crowded living conditions and inadequate
WASH services amplified the pandemic’s
impact. UNHCR supported over 100 health
care facilities and 95 schools with additional
WASH facilities and distributed 50 million
bars of soap, as well as hand sanitizer and
disinfectant, to over 60 operations.
Thousands of handwashing facilities were
installed in public spaces, schools, health
facilities and private accommodation.
The pandemic exacerbated protection
concerns, with 80% of operations

reporting escalating conflict and violence,
and pandemic-related restrictions
affecting IDPs’ ability to seek safety or
return home, access health services and
maintain their livelihoods. Through the
Global Protection Cluster, UNHCR issued
guidance to all field clusters and, with
ICRC, issued common COVID-19
protection messages to all operations
for joint demarches with States.
UNHCR stepped up its response in
the 33 countries where it engaged in
situations of internal displacement.
In Burkina Faso, Colombia and Sudan,
UNHCR supported health authorities
and ensured IDPs had access to health
care; in Somalia, it reinforced COVID-19
awareness raising and ensured two-way
communication; and in Afghanistan, the
Democratic Republic of the Congo, Iraq
and Ukraine, cash and livelihoods were
vital in, for example, addressing the risk
of evictions.
As the pandemic progressed, UNHCR
increasingly invested in 24/7 protection
helplines, local language call centres,
and other remote delivery mechanisms.
These kept communities informed
about COVID-19, maintained two-way
communication on gender-based violence
and mental health, and allowed socially
distant protection case management.
About 85% of operations innovated to
provide services and assistance remotely,
such as delivering high-risk pregnancy
telemedicine in Jordan and contactless
cash in Ecuador.
Gender-based violence increased
dramatically and restrictions on
movement often made it impossible
for those in need to seek help, especially
for those already forcibly displaced. In
Afghanistan, for example, 97% of forcibly
displaced women interviewed for an
assessment reported an increase in
intimate partner violence, as did 69%
in Jordan and an average of 73% in a
multi-country assessment in 15 countries
across Africa. Calls to gender-based

violence hotlines rose 70% in Zimbabwe,
153% in Colombia, and 239% in eastern
Ukraine. Together with partners and
forcibly displaced women and girls
themselves, UNHCR adapted programming,
updated online guidance and tools,
and expanded community mechanisms,
ultimately assisting 2 million women and
girls through dedicated 24/7 helplines.
For those already dealing with the stress
of being uprooted, the pandemic created
an added psychological burden and
increased protection risks, often
disrupting care for those with existing
mental health conditions. UNHCR and
its partners provided mental health and
psychosocial support in 75 countries,
reaching more than 647,000 people.

With schools forced to close,
934,000 students in 74 countries were
assisted to continue learning from home
through radio, television and internetbased programmes. UNHCR worked with
governments to enhance national
educational content platforms, drawing
on investments in connected education.
It distributed books and supplies,
supported refugee-led initiatives and
helped pay refugee teachers. UNHCR’s
global advocacy ensured refugees’ needs
were included in national and global
efforts to address losses in learning,
56 U N H C R G LO B A L R E P O R T 2 02 0

particularly where they were not
addressed by humanitarian or
development financing. The Office
supported safe school reopening,
ensuring schools had WASH and
handwashing facilities and supplying
catch-up resources for learners.

refugee sample, with Kenya also including
one on statelessness. Early findings of
many surveys are striking, highlighting for
example the refugee and host community
poverty gap in Kenya. Overall, in 47 out of
the 52 operations in countries hosting
more than 10,000 refugees, UNHCR
ensured people of concern were included
in UN country teams’ socioeconomic
response plans.

Cash assistance was scaled up to address
immediate needs and mitigate the longerterm socioeconomic impact of COVID-19,
and more than 65 UNHCR operations
launched or expanded cash assistance
programmes, disbursing $695 million to
8.57 million people.
The pandemic underlined the need to
strengthen the transition from immediate
to long-term responses to ensure
protection and solutions for people of
concern, and it increased awareness of
the importance of including forcibly
displaced people in national services
such as WASH, health and vaccine
programmes, and in data collection.
Noting that “what gets counted, counts”,
UNHCR made significant efforts to ensure
socioeconomic assessments of COVID-19
took people of concern into account.
Microdata in Bangladesh, Kenya, Lebanon
and Nigeria provided insight into how
COVID-19 affects people of concern
and, in some cases, host communities.
In nearly all contexts, job losses were
significant, leading to reduced food
consumption and increased poverty
and the incidence of child labour,
while families found it harder to obtain
health care.
UNHCR engaged with development
actors to encourage inclusion in financing,
programmes and social protection
policies, including through its close
partnership with the World Bank Group
which took important measures to
systematically include refugees and others
of concern in its COVID-19 response
efforts in low- and middle-income
countries. Its COVID-19 socioeconomic
surveys carried out in Djibouti, Ethiopia,
Kenya, Morocco and Uganda included a

Partnerships were crucial to UNHCR’s
ability to stay and deliver, adapt
programmes and ensure protection and
life-saving assistance. UNHCR rapidly
issued new guidelines to implementing
partners in April 2020 with greater
flexibility to make discretionary budget
allocations and reduced reporting
requirements. Regional refugee response
plans were revised with partners.
Weekly consultations with NGO partners,
co-organized with the International
Council of Voluntary Agencies (ICVA),

Displaced people’s living conditions
often precluded or hindered physical
distancing. Overcrowding and
evictions were major risks. UNHCR
piloted innovative shelter approaches,
as in Bangladesh, where adding
mezzanines to shelters gave families
nearly 70% more space without using
more land. Globally, UNHCR provided
almost 150,000 emergency shelters, 58%
more than in 2019, installed 268 isolation
and quarantine areas and decongested
overcrowded conditions by providing
shelter-related relief items to over
362,000 people, helping to create
additional space to those modifying
their homes.

and refugee-led organizations, focused
on protection challenges raised by the
pandemic. UNHCR encouraged
localization through a specific fund set up
to target small civil society actors and
launched an innovation award for refugee
led organizations responding to the
pandemic. The annual UNHCR NGO
Innovation Award was dedicated to
refugee-led organizations and their
response to COVID-19, with seven
organizations in each region
acknowledged for their dedication,
innovation and creativity.
The Office increased collaboration with
WHO and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, to
enhance inclusion of people of concern in
national health responses and vaccination
campaigns, and with IFRC to strengthen
localization efforts at country level. A
specific strategic objective to ensure the
rights and assistance needs of refugees,
migrants, stateless and the internally
displaced was also included in the
IASC-led Global Humanitarian Response
Plan.

SPOTLIGHT: Community
response to COVID-19
From the very start of the
pandemic, faced with lockdowns and
movement restrictions, communities
themselves made extraordinary efforts
to protect themselves and others.
Community and religious leaders,
outreach volunteers and women’s and youth groups all engaged to ensure culturally
appropriate and understandable information reached people of concern through
multiple channels. These included social media, going door-to-door, radio, bicycling
to isolated communities, or using megaphones and loudspeakers to ensure all
members of the community were contacted with accurate information.
Displaced women around the world led in protecting their communities, for example
in Zambia where hygiene promoters and community health workers were trained on
safe disclosure and referrals for gender-based violence, as well as psychological first
aid. In Pakistan, female outreach volunteers, community mobilizers and gender
support groups enhanced outreach and communication on COVID-19 preventive
measures, including addressing social stigma and psychosocial support.

UNHCR’S COVID-19 RESPONSE
COVID-19 triggered UNHCR’s first-ever
declaration of a global Level 2 emergency
on 25 March 2020, prompting additional
frame agreements with suppliers to allow
more flexibility in procurement and
deliveries, and UNHCR’s active
participation in the UN COVID-19 Supply
Chain Task Force to streamline and
expedite joint procurement of pandemicrelated items. Strengthened regional
leadership structures were key to the
quality and speed of the COVID-19
response, helping UNHCR to stay and
deliver by providing timely support to
country offices, accessing regional or
local pooled funding mechanisms, and
speeding up decision-making. Regional
bureaux supported procurement efforts,
spearheaded measures to ensure health
care services for frontline staff, and were

9.89 million

In summary, COVID-19 triggered an
immediate worldwide reflex. UNHCR
raced to prevent its most vital protection
and assistance from being disrupted or
interrupted. It reallocated resources and
found new ways of working, pressed
governments to include refugees in their
health responses, and strove to prevent
the pandemic from exacerbating the
plight of refugees—in terms of hunger,
poverty, family separation, education,
discrimination and violence, as well as
health. The pandemic engendered new
partnerships and creativity, but it tested
UNHCR’s ability to respond in a crisis,
with already stretched funding and record
numbers of forcibly displaced people.

Private donors responded generously
with $52 million for UNHCR's COVID-19
appeal, making it the emergency appeal bestfunded by the private sector in UNHCR’s history.
Over 84% of the income came from companies,
foundations and philanthropists, with the
remainder from individual donors contributing
mainly through digital channels. In addition to
financial and in-kind donations, many private
sector partners such as Microsoft and H&M
supported UNHCR by raising awareness among
their stakeholders and amplifying communications
and content about refugees through their platforms.

UN Foundation and UNHCR reimagine shared global problems to ensure no one is left behind
UN Foundation (UNF) was critical in securing $10 million of flexible funding from WHO’s COVID-19 Solidarity
Response Fund to ensure those under UNHCR’s care in vulnerable communities were afforded immediate
support as part of the global health response. This funding helped UNHCR to ensure populations of
concern were included in national health systems and to mitigate some of the effects of the pandemic
on vulnerable communities. With less than a decade of action left to achieve the 2030 SDGs, UNHCR’s
partnership with UNF represents the kind of collaboration and impact needed to transform the UN’s
approach to shared global problems.

Sony steps up as one of the first major contributors to UNHCR’s COVID-19 response
Sony donated $3 million from the Sony Global Relief Fund for COVID-19, established in 2020. This was the
first major corporate contribution to UNHCR’s COVID-19 appeal in early April. Sony complemented this by
organizing an employee-matching gift programme, raising a further $38,000 for UNHCR. Sony has been
supporting UNHCR since 1991 through different initiatives, including in-kind donations and by sponsoring
the UNHCR Refugee Film Festival.

Pillars of change:
Transforming UNHCR in 2020
© UNHCR/Shawkat Alharfosh

Through the Habesha scholarship programme, which was expanded at the Global Refugee Forum, Zakariya—a refugee in Jordan’s Zaatari camp for eight
years—has been selected for a scholarship to study for a BA in psychology in Mexico.

UNHCR’s change process was designed
to better position it to protect and assist
people of concern, work with others to
promote solutions, and address new
challenges and identify new opportunities.
The transformation—still ongoing—
encompassed multiple areas of work
across a range of pillars. The Global
Compact on Refugees, which is part of this
transformation, set out a framework for
ensuring more predictable and sustainable
burden- and responsibility-sharing
arrangements in the context of large-scale
movements of refugees and protracted
refugee situations.

Undaunted, many pledgers—States,
NGOs, refugees, the private sector,
academia, development actors, cities,
faith leaders and other stakeholders—
stepped up to fulfil their commitments.
Many pledges were adapted or
accelerated to support the response to
the pandemic.
By the end of 2020, UNHCR had received
updates for nearly half of the pledges,
with over 70% of updates indicating work
in progress and 15% at the planning stage,
while an encouraging 71 pledges were
fulfilled in 2020. Over 230 good practices
directly linked to the objectives of the
GCR were shared on the GCR Digital
Platform, particularly in the areas of jobs
and livelihoods, education and solutions.

In 2019, Oxford University’s Refugee Studies Centre
evaluated UNHCR and IKEA Foundation’s livelihoods
programme in Dollo Ado, Ethiopia, which focuses on agriculture,
livestock, energy, and microfinance loans through a cooperative
model. The programme’s positive impact includes greater cooperation
between refugees and host community members, reported income
increases, expansion of markets and the provision of electricity.
In line with the Global Compact on Refugees, this strategic partnership
has successfully created innovative and sustainable solutions for
refugees. In 2020, the programme was recognized for its success by the International Finance Corporation and Financial

Europe) aligned UNHCR’s structures
more closely with other UN agencies and
international NGO partners, significantly
strengthening the Office’s ability to
engage with them at the regional level.
For example, NGO consultations
organized by UNHCR’s regional bureaux
allowed for more focused discussions
on regional contexts and brought local
civil society into the conversation. The
newly-decentralized bureaux in Europe,
the Americas and Africa also engaged
with the Issue-Based Coalitions, regional
groupings of UN bodies tackling
cross-cutting issues such as the
challenges posed by human mobility.

UNHCR’s new regional presence also
enabled greater engagement with
regional intergovernmental organizations
and mechanisms. UNHCR supported the
IGAD platform to implement a regional
refugee framework focusing on inclusion
and assisting member states in East Africa,
and also signed a memorandum of

understanding with the African
Development Bank to mobilize and direct
resources to the Sahel to support the
primary health response and the
resilience of vulnerable communities in

Niger. The creation of dedicated external

COVID-19 also put a sharp focus on
UNHCR’s occupational health and safety.
It had to fulfil its mission to assist
populations of concern without deviating
from its duty to safeguard the health and
safety of its workforce. Preventive action
protected colleagues with underlying
medical conditions, with offers to telework
or relocate to where medical facilities
were available, and personal protective
equipment was supplied to those working
in camps and communities. Local health
care assessments helped operations to
strengthen their staff’s access to care,
and medical support by phone was made
available in several languages for
personnel and their families.
UNHCR recognized how COVID-19 could
create mental health stresses, as staff
faced isolation, separation, multiple roles
at home, and the difficulty of travelling for
rest and recuperation. Psychosocial
capacity was strengthened through the
network of peer advisors and regional
staff counsellors, and additional external
mental health support was provided.
UNHCR continued to be a leader in
inter-agency efforts on health and safety
matters throughout 2020 and was an
active contributor to the UN System-Wide
Task Force on Medical Evacuations,
the inter-agency efforts to strengthen
the medical first line of defence, and
the UN vaccination strategy. This
strengthened the representation of field
concerns, which underpinned
UN preparedness and response plans.

collaboration with IOM, OCHA, UNESCO,
UNICEF, UNRWA, WFP and WHO among
others. As part of the UNICEF-UNHCRUN Reform
Blueprint, UNHCR established 13 data
projects to improve data interoperability
and data sharing, and to support the
objectives of the Blueprint for the
inclusion of refugees in UNICEF and
government data systems. There were
improvements to UNHCR’s statistical
reporting, data collection and
methodology, including a new Statistical
Quality Assurance Framework. UNHCR
co-led the Common Good Data Initiatives
aimed at strengthening the capacity to
gather, access and manage strategic
information and to improve analysis and
communication of data as evidence.
The Office worked across the UN to
develop the Secretary-General’s Data
Strategy and make more use of the UN’s
data. UNHCR helped to put the WFP-UNHCR
Joint Programme Excellence and
Targeting Hub into operation, creating a
joint targeting capability and supporting
inter-agency collaboration. UNHCR and
WFP’s data sharing memorandum of
understanding was put into action,
resulting in the first implementation of
biometric data access and data transfer
solutions between agencies, integrating
WFP’s SCOPE with UNHCR’s PRIMES
ecosystem for beneficiary authentication.
UNHCR further ensured interoperability

of data systems by issuing minimum
standards to assist operations where
WFP “Building Blocks” were implemented
in refugee contexts. UNHCR provided
technical leadership to the UN Common

Risk Management 2.0

Staying, delivering, and
managing risks through
the pandemic

The pandemic posed risks
unlike any faced by UNHCR in its history,
compelling UNHCR to increase its
response whilst minimizing its physical
footprint. From the start of the COVID-19
outbreak, risk management colleagues
across the organization contributed to
COVID-19 preparedness, ensuring that
pandemic-related risks were rapidly
identified, managed and monitored.
A COVID-19 risk register gave an overview
of the risks faced by refugees and UNHCR,
including organization-wide risks to business
continuity. Identifying risks helped to
support early action and coordination
with broader UN coordination, from
contingency planning to procurement.
By elaborating the risks linked to COVID-19
and pointing towards solutions, the
register aimed to minimize operational
disruption, provide a framework for
action, and support the organization’s
effort to stay and deliver in extraordinary
circumstances.

When physical distancing threatened to
interrupt protection and support services,
operations actively sought to remain
engaged and responsive to the needs of
people of concern. UNHCR expanded
cash assistance, increasing contactless
and mobile money payments. To address
new challenges this posed, anti-fraud
training was conducted in Greece,
Somalia and South Sudan, whilst the
accountability chain of the cash
assistance programme in Yemen and
in other operations was strengthened.
Increased reports of gender-based
violence and risks of sexual exploitation
and abuse prompted operations to
increase focus on communicating with
communities, providing ways for people
in need to continue to seek support from
UNHCR or its partners. Inside UNHCR,
the crisis drove innovation and change,
with heightened attention to duty of
care to the workforce and use of digital
technology to communicate. Following
a risk assessment in Bangladesh, and to
mitigate immediate risks to the health of
personnel, the operation converted part

The year saw the conclusion of UNHCR’s
Risk Management 2.0 initiative, in which
the organization invested in people,
tools and processes to better manage
uncertainties. The initiative brought a
noticeable improvement in the quality
of risk analysis and mitigation measures,
which in turn has increased transparency,
data-driven decision-making and
accountability.
By the end of 2020, each of the seven
regional bureaux and 12 high-risk
countries had a senior risk adviser in
place. Despite travel restrictions,
the network of risk advisers provided
learning and support to more than
1,800 colleagues, increasing overall use
and knowledge of risk management in
UNHCR and empowering the workforce
to scan the horizon for risks and
opportunities, and to make informed
decisions in the light of these. Echoing
the emphasis that the High Commissioner
has put on integrity-related risks, close
to 100 senior leaders were trained in
reputational risk management and crisis
communications.
To support a coordinated and integrated
response to crises, UNHCR took a
situational risk approach, involving key
country operations. When Burundian
refugees requested to repatriate, risk and
protection colleagues from Burundi and
asylum countries conducted a joint risk
assessment around voluntary repatriation.
They identified risks affecting the
objective of a return in safety and dignity,

as well as measures to address such risks,
providing a roadmap for action.
The improving quality of risk registers
has provided UNHCR with up-to-date
and accurate risk information. To support
colleagues in addressing high risks in
areas such as cash assistance,
procurement, prevention of sexual
exploitation and abuse, and partnership
management, short and practical risk
management tools were developed and
disseminated. UNHCR’s risk management
policy was updated, reflecting changes
in international norms and UNHCR’s
decentralization and regionalization
process. To embed risk management into
its core processes, UNHCR took decisive
steps to reflect the new results-based
management approach in its risk
management tools, so that considering
risks and opportunities becomes an
inherent part of strategic planning.
As the number of people who depend
on UNHCR’s support is ever-growing
and crisis in displacement becomes more
complex, combining the effects of
violence, pandemic and climate change,
taking and managing the risks required to
deliver our mandate will remain a priority
for the organization. Whilst good progress
was made with the Risk Management
2.0 initiative, work needs to continue to
further strengthen UNHCR’s risk culture
in all operational and management areas.
To that end, a five-year strategy is under
development.

Integrity and oversight
As with other parts of UNHCR, the
pandemic presented UNHCR’s
independent oversight providers with a
unique set of challenges that had to be
overcome. By adapting and innovating,
a revised plan and new working methods
were in place by the end of March 2020,
ensuring oversight could continue.

The response to the COVID-19 emergency
included deferring a number of reviews;
moving to remote auditing and reviews;
providing advisory and thematic audit
and review work; ensuring COVID-related
questions were embedded into their
work; and reporting in a more agile,
short-form format to provide ongoing
feedback and response to UNHCR
management. Towards the end of 2020,
coordinated planning conversations
between the key oversight providers were
undertaken to ensure a well-balanced and
coherent overall oversight plan was in
place for 2021.
There was also oversight of UNHCR’s
pandemic response, including reviews of
supply chain and procurement activities;
partner selection and management;
distribution of cash assistance and core
relief items; vendor and emergency
procurement fraud risk; controls over
implementing partners; and remote
programme and protection monitoring.
These were undertaken through a mixture
of advisory and audit modalities.

in 2017, 1,186 in 2018 and 1,226 in 2019.

OV E R V I E W I T R A N S F O R M AT I V E I N I T I AT I V E S

In 2020, the pandemic hampered
reporting of misconduct complaints,
which declined 7% to 1,146. For 2021,
based on increasing numbers of
complaints at the end of 2020, a return
to pre-pandemic levels of 1,200 per
annum is predicted. During 2020,
UNHCR opened investigations
implicating 142 individuals and finalized
130 investigation reports, of which 55%
(71 out of 130) were substantiated.
UNHCR continues to invest in measures
to enhance oversight. The office of the
newly-appointed Inspector General
(IGO) updated its strategy and
thoroughly reviewed its operations,
resulting in further realignment of IGO
staff to regional locations and a
comprehensive change to the IGO’s
strategic oversight function. It introduced
improved standard operating procedures
relating to complaints intake assessment
processes, and for applying a victimcentred approach to investigations,
and its digital capability was enhanced
with new forensic tools and an upgrade
of the complaints case management
system.

SPOTLIGHT: Preventing fraud committed by people of concern
As part of decentralization and regionalization, regional anti-fraud focal
points were supported in enhancing capacity in their respective
operations to improve the detection and response to fraud by people of concern.
This led to the identification of evidence-based gaps and the subsequent
development of context-specific anti-fraud tools and materials. An internal data
visualization tool was developed to monitor performance in fraud management,
trends analysis and reporting. The tool allows for easy reporting instances of fraud
based on real-time proGres v4 data, thereby facilitating management and operational
responses. In operations using proGres v4, there were 105 cases detected in 2020
(up from 79 in 2019), with about 40% of detected cases resolved during the year.
More than 90% of operations conducting individual processing of people of
concern’s information now have designated personnel and, with over 300 staff
having received dedicated anti-fraud training, UNHCR’s ability to detect fraud by
people of concern has increased significantly, as have more structured responses.

UNHCR’s fight against sexual exploitation
and abuse and sexual harassment
© UNHCR/Santiago Escobar-Jaramillo

High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi meets young Venezuelan survivors of sexual exploitation at the Fundación Renacer in Riohacha, Colombia.

The High Commissioner’s role as
IASC Champion on Protection from
Sexual Exploitation and Abuse and
Sexual Harassment
Tackling sexual misconduct, within
UNHCR and in the wider humanitarian
sector, is critical to UNHCR’s vision of
a trusted, respectful and inclusive
environment where the people it serves
and those who support them feel safe,
heard, equipped and empowered.
In 2020, the High Commissioner brought
this commitment forward by taking on the
role of IASC Champion on Protection from
Sexual Exploitation and Abuse and Sexual
Harassment, launching several initiatives
to further his three main priority areas
of bolstering prevention, expanding safe
spaces and promoting respectful use
of authority.
These initiatives included learning
packages, communications materials,
and best practice guidance, some of
it aimed at capacity building and
awareness-raising amongst humanitarian
personnel and affected communities.

Other aspects supported humanitarian
leadership in building respectful and
inclusive working environments and a
speak-up culture, and some initiatives
proved particularly relevant in the context
of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Examples included a learning package
for NGO partners—“Saying NO to sexual
misconduct”—which was jointly
developed with IOM, WFP and others.
It fostered creative engagement and
dialogue and works through the
implications of power differentials and
people’s responsibilities as humanitarian
workers. The package includes video,
case studies and testimonies, is easily
tailored for different audiences and
contexts, and is currently available in
English, French, Spanish, Arabic and
Portuguese. Another initiative was the
PSEA Community Outreach and
Communication Fund, launched by
UNHCR and ICVA in April 2020 at a time
when COVID-19 and related restrictions
challenged efforts to prevent and respond
to sexual exploitation and abuse. The
Fund provides small-scale grants to NGO

projects supporting community-led
efforts to raise awareness of prevention
of sexual exploitation and abuse. Of
1,600 applications received, 19 grants
were awarded to organizations across all
regions. A range of projects developed
targeted multimedia awareness-raising
tools, such as that of the NGO Lotus
Flower Iraq. The NGO launched
campaigns for IDPs which prioritized
strengthening reporting channels in IDP
camps and engagement with women and
girls at heightened risk of sexual
exploitation and abuse.
A communications package was made
available in English and French to guide
IASC Principals in meaningful discussions
with staff on sexual misconduct. The tool
uses impactful videos to facilitate often
uncomfortable discussions and aims to
promote a speak-up culture and, although
designed for face-to-face engagement,
the package lends itself to online use.
The High Commissioner closed his tenure
as IASC Champion by hosting a session
with all IASC Principals on values,
attitudes, and organizational culture,
providing a forum for reflection on the
underlying factors in organizational
culture and behaviour that give rise to
sexual misconduct and abuse of power.
A similar session was held with the CEB
Task Force on sexual harassment, hosted
by UNHCR’s Deputy High Commissioner.
Two additional products will be finalized
in the course of 2021, an e-learning for
NGO partners on investigating sexual
exploitation and abuse, and a collection
of good practices on organizational
culture change. While the High
Commissioner’s tenure as IASC Champion
has ended, close and strong collaboration
with all its partners will underscore
UNHCR’s efforts to tackle sexual
misconduct, as it is only through
inter-agency and broader partnerships
that such abuses can be eradicated.

Ethics
Even with the constraints of the virtual
environment dictated by the pandemic,
the mandatory Code of Conduct dialogue
sessions still reached 74% of the
workforce in 120 operations. The
sessions, with their focus on trust and
collaboration, and the increased links to
mitigating integrity risks, contributed to
an organizational culture valuing trust,
collaboration, dialogue and integrity.
There was a nearly 100% compliance
rate with the UN Financial Disclosure
Programme, and 430 colleagues were
assisted with professional, confidential,
ethics advice on issues like conflicts of
interest and engagement on social media.
This contributed to the overall integrity of
the organization and promoted ethical
decision-making and behaviour in
accordance with UN standards
and values. 
There was a 17% increase from 2019 in
requests from personnel for advice on
protection against retaliation, indicating
higher engagement with and trust in
institutional efforts to protect colleagues
speaking up, as well as progress in
creating a speak-up culture. These efforts
included an external “SpeakUp!” helpline
providing UNHCR personnel with an
additional channel for reporting
misconduct, including sexual misconduct,
and raising other concerns and
grievances.

UNHCR’s engagement in
situations of internal displacement
© UNHCR/Marie-Joëlle Jean-Charles

Daoud sits outside his family’s temporary shelter at a site in Al Mukha, Taizz, in Yemen. They fled At Tuhayat 18 months ago when fighting destroyed their home.

In many places around the world, internal
displacement has become chronic.
At the end of 2020, the global number
of internally displaced people due to
violence and conflict reached an
estimated 48.6 million, the highest ever
recorded and 5.1 million more than
in 2019.
In 2020, major drivers of forced
displacement were escalating conflict and
violence, massive human rights abuses
ranging from forced recruitment to torture
and rape, and the impact of climate
change, including depleted natural
resources, diminished crop yields and
livestock shortages. The pandemic itself
was also a cause of flight, with recorded
instances of people moving from crowded
urban locations to rural settings in an
attempt to avoid contagion, including
in Somalia and Yemen.
Within this context, UNHCR continued its
stepped-up engagement in situations of

internal displacement. Spending on IDP
programmes under Pillar 4 rose 9%, with
an additional $21.5 million transferred
from the Operational Reserve for
emergency response to nine operations
(in the Central African Republic,
Honduras, Mali, Mozambique, Myanmar,
Nigeria, the Panama multi-country office,
the Syrian Arab Republic and Ukraine).
Notably, decentralization empowered
regional bureaux and representatives
to quickly redeploy funds to meet IDP
emergency response needs.

For more
information on
internal displacement
and related trends,
see Chapter 3 of the
2020 Global Trends
report

UNHCR combined coordination
leadership with field operations, bringing
delivery closer to people of concern,
enhancing credibility with cluster partners
and strengthening relations with
governments, especially at local level.
Engagement via community-based
protection networks, telephone hotlines,
and other virtual means helped to make
up for the physical distancing introduced

to fight COVID-19. UNHCR Yemen in
particular established best practices in
this regard, helping to guide engagement
in other locations.
UNHCR moved during the year towards
integrated programming inclusive of all
population groups in an operational
context, including host communities.
In Colombia, the Casa de los Derechos
project was an example of an area-based
approach that brings legal assistance
and other benefits to co-located IDPs,
refugees, returnees and local communities
experiencing similar protection needs
and risks. In Afghanistan, UNHCR applied
an area-based, whole of community
approach aimed at mitigating protection
risks and vulnerabilities of all affected
communities while facilitating sustainable
solutions including reintegration of
refugee returnees and IDPs.
Investments in solutions underpinned
UNHCR’s IDP work. Solutions can be
achieved where local communities are
resilient, and this requires investments in
national capacity, including through
international financial institutions.
UNHCR’s IDP policy identifies solutions
as integral to all IDP engagement, be it
through support to local authorities and
communities or enhancing partnerships
beyond the traditional humanitarian
stakeholders and including development
actors. Advocacy and related
interventions for the inclusion of IDPs in
national services and pandemic-related
safety nets established by States remain
central to the approach.
UNHCR closely engaged with the HighLevel Panel on Internal Displacement by
sharing experiences and supporting the
global and national discourse on IDP
solutions, contributing to dialogue with
IDPs and with experts. UNHCR’s
contributions to the Panel were through
consultations and written submissions

72 U N H C R G LO B A L R E P O R T 2 02 0

based on its extensive experience in
advancing solutions in refugee and
IDP settings.

Tri-cluster coordination
On coordination, within the Inter-Agency
Standing Committee framework, UNHCR
leads the Global Protection Cluster (GPC)
and co-leads the Global Shelter Cluster
(GSC) with IFRC and the Global Camp
Coordination and Camp Management
Cluster (CCCM) with IOM. UNHCR also
coordinates national protection, shelter
and CCCM clusters, usually with NGO
partners. Strategic direction for UNHCR’s
cluster engagement is provided jointly by
UNHCR’s Assistant High Commissioners
for Operations and for Protection, thus
elevating the strategic impact of cluster
leadership within UNHCR, especially at
regional bureaux encompassing all
country operations.
UNHCR continues to build strategic
partnerships for IDP protection, including
by co-chairing the three-year, multistakeholder plan of action for the
20th anniversary of the Guiding Principles
on Internal Displacement (GP20). In
2020, following regional exchanges
with the Economic Community of
West African States (ECOWAS) and
the Intergovernmental Authority on
Development (IGAD), UNHCR
spearheaded exchanges on internal
displacement in the Americas, Asia and
Middle East, in collaboration with the
Inter-American Court of Human Rights and
the Platform on Disaster Displacement.
UNHCR’s IDP Initiative 2020-2021 and
its quarterly updates facilitate public
dissemination of notable activities in
IDP operations, with special focus on
community approaches, partnerships
and solutions.

Global Protection Cluster
The GPC and national protection clusters
advocated for the rights of 78 million
people in need of protection, of which
31.5 million people received assistance
in 26 operations. UNHCR led 29 out of
32 field protection clusters and clusterlike mechanisms. The GPC Coordinator
undertook field missions to Burkina Faso
and Iraq while GPC Operations Cell
members undertook field missions to
Ethiopia and Sudan and provided remote
technical support and sharing of good
practices to field protection clusters.
This saw the GPC working with over
1,000 diverse partners around the world.
The 2020 Global Protection Forum,
hosted by the GPC’s Strategic Advisory
Group and the four GPC areas of
responsibility, gathered the Child
Protection, Gender-Based Violence,
Housing Land and Property and Mine
Action Areas of Responsibility brought
together over 3,000 humanitarian, peace
and development partners, academics,
UN Member States and donors to discuss
contemporary protection challenges and
gaps, exchange lessons learned and
provide strategic direction.

Global Camp Coordination and
Camp Management Cluster
(co-led with IOM)
The global CCCM cluster supported
23 country-level clusters and cluster-like
structures in 2020, with UNHCR leading
or co-leading 19. The UNHCR CCCM
Global Cluster Team developed “Camp/
site management interim operational
guidance for COVID-19 readiness and
response”, containing key considerations
to incorporate into pandemic
preparedness and operational planning.
The Team also provided input and
support for the IASC’s interim guidance

on “Scaling-up COVID-19 outbreak
readiness and response operations in
humanitarian situations, including camps
and camp-like settings”, guidance which
was jointly produced with IFRC, IOM,
WHO and UNHCR.
The team delivered virtual COVID-19related capacity-building workshops for
Cameroon, Chad, the Democratic
Republic of the Congo (DRC), Mali,
Pakistan, Mexico, Yemen and the Latin
America sub-region. A virtual mission to
Sudan supported the establishment of a
COVID-19 IDP camp coordination task
force, and the roll-out of a survey on
preparedness gaps and services.
Continuous consultations with
stakeholders improved CCCM delivery in
Burkina Faso, the Central African
Republic, DRC, Ethiopia, Iraq,
Mozambique, Myanmar, Somalia and
Sudan. This was done through a
combination of scaling up staffing,
resource mobilization and advocacy,
capacity building, and coordination and
operational support missions.

Global Shelter Cluster
(co-led with IFRC)
UNHCR led 16 of the 30 country-level
shelter clusters and 19 of the 37 shelter
coordination mechanisms, with one
newly activated in 2020 in the DRC. The
UNHCR-led clusters provided shelter and
core relief items to over 12 million IDPs
through 535 partners in conflict
situations, representing 81.6% of all
displaced people assisted with shelter
globally. Some 2.2 million people were
reached with COVID-19-specific shelter
activities in 12 out of the 16 UNHCR-led
clusters with activities such as shelter and
core relief items for medical, quarantine
or isolation facilities, or to reduce
overcrowded living conditions.

In 2020, the cluster launched rental
market guidance, updated the
coordination toolkit and delivered the
annual meeting and coordinators'
workshop online, consisting of 59 events,
including thematic sessions, country
cluster briefings and regional events with
over 1,000 participants. In addition, the
GSC hosted monthly webinars in shelter
response to COVID-19 with coordinators
and operational staff.
The UNHCR GSC team provided 132 days
of field mission support in Burkina Faso,
the Democratic Republic of the Congo,
Sudan and the Syrian Arab Republic, in
addition to 274 days of remote support.
Specifically on COVID-19, the UNHCR-led
GSC team supported countries in
adapting their response and in providing
resources through a specific COVID-19
shelter library.

Since 2012, Qatar Charity (QC) has been one of
UNHCR’s top private partners and has supported
around 1.4 million displaced individuals. In 2020
alone, QC supported Syrian refugees in Lebanon
and IDPs in Yemen with contributions of $3.5 million.
These funds were used to provide urgent cash
assistance for internally displaced families in
Yemen and Syrian refugee families in Lebanon to
help them meet their most urgent needs and
mitigate the socioeconomic effects of the
COVID-19 pandemic.

In conclusion, important progress was
made towards the UNHCR objective
of a more decisive and predictable
engagement in situations of internal
displacement. An acceleration of efforts
ensured a strengthened organizational
response, as required by the revised
IDP Policy, encompassing UNHCR’s
coordination and operational delivery
interventions, and covering the
full spectrum of response, including
preparedness and solutions.

Climate change increases the risk
of displacement, makes it harder for
displaced people to return home,
and poses a multitude of risks and
protection concerns during displacement.
Approximately 20% of the world’s
population lives in a highly climatevulnerable country, but refugees and IDPs
are particularly at risk with nearly 90%
of refugees under UNHCR’s mandate
coming from a highly vulnerable country.
These same countries host over 40%
of refugees and nearly 70% of IDPs
displaced by conflict.
Climate change is already a threat to
UNHCR’s preparedness, response and
solutions work. In 2020, droughts,
flooding, storms and hurricanes posed
challenges to UNHCR operations from
Bangladesh to the Sahel to Central
America, and globally there were
30.7 million new displacements due to
disasters. This was the highest figure in

a decade, and over three times higher
than the 9.8 million displaced by conflict.
As the world continues to heat rapidly,
and as the risks of displacement only
increase, UNHCR has stepped up its
commitment and ambition to tackle the
humanitarian and protection challenges
of the climate emergency. The office of
the Special Advisor on Climate Action 
was established in January 2020
to provide strategic guidance, oversight
and expertise in shaping UNHCR’s
climate action agenda and responding
to growing protection concerns.
The Strategic Framework for Climate
Action (SFCA) was developed, setting
out the parameters of UNHCR’s response
under three pillars:
•	 Law and policy: legal and normative
guidance and policy engagement to
better protect people of concern in
the context of climate change and
disasters.

U N H C R G LO B A L R E P O R T 2 02 0 75

OV E R V I E W I T R A N S F O R M AT I V E I N I T I AT I V E S

•	 Operations: strengthening the
resilience of displaced populations
to climate and environmental risks,
enhancing preparedness and response
to displacement in disaster situations,
and protecting the environment in
displacement settings.
•	 UNHCR’s environmental footprint:
reducing its greenhouse gas emissions
and minimizing its environmental
impact.

UNHCR’s long-standing support to the
Nansen Initiative Protection Agenda
continued as part of the State-led
Platform on Disaster Displacement,
along with IOM, was formalized through
a memorandum of understanding. As
a member of the Warsaw International

76 U N H C R G LO B A L R E P O R T 2 02 0

Mechanism for Loss and Damage’s
Task Force on Displacement under the
UN Framework Convention on Climate
Change, UNHCR supported Parties’
consideration of policy and measures
to avert, minimize and address climaterelated displacement. At the regional
level, UNHCR contributed to inter-agency
dialogue with the European Union on
human mobility related to climate change
and the development of policy and
guidance on adaptation and
preparedness.

operational guidance was developed
on “IDP protection responses in the
context of disasters and the adverse
effects of climate change”. This focuses
on key protection issues and priorities
during the preparedness and emergency
response phase.
Lastly, under the third pillar, UNHCR is
reducing its own environmental footprint
and greenhouse gas emissions in line
with Greening the Blue, the UN systemwide commitment to improve
environmental sustainability. In 2020,
UNHCR achieved climate neutrality for
the second year running through offsets
and developed a greening and
sustainability strategy focusing on four
areas:

As part of the operations pillar of the
SFCA, climate and environmental risk
related to supply were integrated in a new
procurement policy, including greener
procurement of core relief items, and
efforts are underway to move towards
greener packaging. There was also a
review of the impact of cash assistance
and the use of core relief item donations
on the environment.
In the first year of its 10-year ambition,
the Clean Energy Challenge (CEC)
graduated from an aspiration to a
mechanism for implementation, a
further step towards the goal of bringing
affordable, reliable and sustainable
energy to all settlements of forcibly
displaced people and nearby host
communities by 2030. In line with the
Global Compact on Refugees, UNHCR
plays a catalytic role, building
partnerships and advocating greater
engagement of business actors,
governments, development actors,
NGOs, and experts to support the CEC.
Recognizing the need to increase
preparedness for situations where
UNHCR is called upon to respond in
non-conflict-related emergencies,

•	 The Green Box initiative uses energy
meters in UNHCR offices to measure
global energy consumption. In 2020,
225 offices in 115 countries enrolled
in the initiative.

•	 The Green Fund is an innovative
financing mechanism to power field
offices with renewable energy, with
pilots planned in Ethiopia, Kenya and
Uganda.
•	 Promoting energy efficient practices
and eco-conscious behaviours
throughout UNHCR. For example, a
carpooling project in Lebanon involving
UNHCR and UNICEF will contribute to
financial efficiencies, reduced
emissions and optimized fleet sizes.
The SFCA recognizes that the magnitude
of the climate emergency requires
unprecedented collaboration to meet
the growing protection challenges and
achieve impact at scale. In this spirit,
UNHCR led the development of an
interagency predictive analytics project
addressing the interconnected risks in
the Sahel and how climate change will
affect the humanitarian, development,
and peace and security sectors.

•	 The Green Data initiative creates a
data warehouse that helps identify
opportunities to transition to renewable
energy.

As part of the law and policy pillar,
UNHCR released “Legal considerations
regarding claims for international
protection made in the context of the
adverse effects of climate change and
disasters”. This provided guidance for
States, legal practitioners and other
actors in applying international refugee
and human rights law to protect people
displaced across borders in the context
of climate change and disasters. UNHCR
also continued cooperation with
academics, legal experts and
practitioners in the area, providing
technical support to research papers and
intervening upon invitation at conferences
and other events, and thus widening the
network of partners. A key example of
such an opportunity was afforded by
“COVID-19 and climate change: what can
we learn?” at the High Commissioner’s
annual Dialogue on Protection under the
theme “Protection challenges during
pandemics”.

After Burundi’s 2020 elections, the Government strengthened engagement with the international community
including humanitarian actors. The overall working environment and the political and security situation
improved, although reports of human rights abuses continued. In line with the Burundi Regional Refugee
Response Plan, which brought together 35 partners, UNHCR provided protection, assistance and access to
services for an estimated 313,000 Burundian refugees, mainly in Rwanda, the Democratic Republic of the
Congo and the United Republic of Tanzania. UNHCR pressed for their inclusion in national COVID-19
responses. Food shortages grew, leading to negative coping mechanisms, including gender-based violence
and premature returns. COVID-19 disrupted schools, stretched health services and constrained access to
registration, asylum and voluntary repatriation. Although health screenings, isolation facilities, personal
protective equipment, testing and social distancing added unplanned costs to the repatriation movements,
UNHCR helped 40,900 refugees to return from Rwanda, the United Republic of Tanzania and Uganda, bringing
the total returns to Burundi to close to 120,500 since voluntary repatriation activities began in 2017. UNHCR did
not promote returns but continued to support those who expressed an interest in returning home voluntarily.

UNHCR provided South Sudanese refugees with protection and basic assistance, in line with the South Sudan
Regional Refugee Response Plan, which brought together 96 partners, with gender-based violence and child
protection as priorities. UNHCR promoted refugee inclusion in COVID-19 prevention and response measures
in line with the Comprehensive Refugee Response Framework and the Global Refugee Forum. However,
support for livelihoods activities was constrained during the pandemic. UNHCR strengthened its engagement

Decades of civil war and instability have created UNHCR’s longest refugee crisis, with more than
686,000 Somali refugees residing in Ethiopia, Kenya, Yemen and elsewhere in the region. 3 million 
Somalis were displaced within the country by the end of 2020. With COVID-19 as well as insecurity hindering
cross-border movement, a total of 1,560 Somali refugees returned home. UNHCR assisted 600 refugees of these,
while others returned on their own. Cumulatively, 92,150 Somali refugees have been assisted to return since
2014. Amid ongoing state-building and funding shortfalls, returnees, IDPs and the 24,500 refugees and
asylum-seekers hosted in Somalia faced insecurity and climate-related shocks such as floods, droughts
and locust infestations. The UNHCR-led protection return monitoring network in Somalia recorded nearly
1.3 million new displacements, 70% due to flooding. Most remained in need of urgent humanitarian assistance.
As well as providing direct support for protection, assistance and solutions for the most vulnerable, UNHCR and
partners helped build the Government’s capacity to implement comprehensive protection and solutions
for 3.3 million people of concern.

Over 2.2 million South Sudanese refugees were hosted in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia,
Kenya, Sudan and Uganda at the end of 2020, the largest refugee crisis in Africa, with 28,000 new refugees
during the year. 2020 saw slow progress towards peace and the implementation of the Revitalized
Agreement on the Resolution of the Conflict in South Sudan (R-ARCSS). After years of conflict, the situation
was not yet considered conducive for safe, dignified and sustainable returns for the majority of South
Sudanese refugees, but 122,000 did choose to return on their own in 2020.

***Budget and funding for the Ethiopia (Tigray) situation in 2020 were mainstreamed
in the relevant countries programmes.

Violence flared in Ethiopia’s Tigray region in November 2020, driving some 55,000 Ethiopians to seek refuge
in eastern Sudan. Some 96,000 Eritrean refugees—registered in Tigray before the crisis erupted—were also
severely affected. Some were forced to flee to find safety elsewhere in Ethiopia, including in Addis Ababa.
UNHCR led the inter-agency refugee response plan in Sudan, working with the Government and partners to
provide life-saving assistance, expand reception facilities and set up two refugee camps to offer the
55,000 refugees protection, water, sanitation, health care, education, shelter and food.
In Tigray, communication blackouts and lack of access precluded any immediate response. UNHCR joined the
rest of the UN in requesting unhindered access and raised concerns about the safety and well-being of the
Eritrean refugees and hundreds of thousands of IDPs. UNHCR extended assistance, protection services and
cash grants to many of the Eritrean refugees who had fled to Addis Ababa.

KEY ACHIEVEMENTS AND IMPACT
Safeguarding access to protection
and asylum

Responding with life-saving
assistance

UNHCR urged countries in the region
to uphold the right to seek asylum as
pandemic-related border closures
hampered access to both territory and
asylum procedures. UNHCR appealed for
special measures to allow asylum-seekers
to be screened, quarantined and
admitted, and for UNHCR to be granted
access to areas where new refugees
arrived. As a result, most countries in the
region, including Kenya, South Sudan,
Sudan and Uganda, kept borders open
to refugees or exceptionally allowed
them access to their territory.

UNHCR supported host governments,
providing life-saving assistance and
ensuring access to services for all
refugees, with attention to the most
vulnerable, and particularly those affected
by the Tigray emergency in Sudan and
Ethiopia, as well as new arrivals from the
Democratic Republic of the Congo in
Burundi and Uganda and new arrivals
from South Sudan in Ethiopia, Sudan and
Uganda. This included basic measures
to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in
all refugee camps and settlements:
improving health facilities and water
and sanitation services and investing
in risk communication and community
engagement. Over 6 million people of
concern to UNHCR accessed essential
health care services in the East and
Horn of Africa and the Great Lakes.
All countries in the region organized
information campaigns about COVID-19
in areas inhabited by refugees, IDPs and
others of concern. When schools closed,
UNHCR supported remote education
approaches, including broadcasting lessons
over the radio. It installed handwashing
facilities in schools and supported other
measures to help them eventually reopen
safely. A total of 323,770 children and
youth across the region were supported
with distance/home-based learning by
the end of the year.

COVID-19 mitigation measures,
particularly restrictions on staff presence
in offices, disrupted activities aimed at
strengthening the capacity of State
asylum systems and delayed individual
refugee status determination (RSD)
procedures. However, some RSD
processing continued thanks to deskbased casework, the installation of
plexiglass interview room-dividers, and
the adaption of case processing to allow
remote interviewing and virtual status
determination committee meetings.
UNHCR prioritized gender-based violence
and child protection, including raising
awareness and preventing and
responding to specific gender-based
violence risks, as well as scaling up
existing helplines, increasing investment
in community-based structures, training
refugee workers to safely report and
refer cases, and adjusting individual case
management monitoring. In total, some
12,600 survivors reporting incidents of
gender-based violence received
psychosocial counselling.

84 U N H C R G LO B A L R E P O R T 2 02 0

Life-saving interventions targeted those
most adversely impacted by the COVID-19
pandemic, particularly people whose
livelihoods, well-being and dignity were
affected. Refugees and IDPs in several
countries in the region including Djibouti,
Ethiopia, Kenya, South Sudan, the United
Republic of Tanzania, and Uganda
were seriously affected by WFP food
ration cuts.

R E G I O N A L S U M M A R I E S I E A S T A N D H O R N O F A F R I C A A N D T H E G R E AT L A K E S

Cash assistance to urban refugees
represented a lifeline for those who had
suffered income loss, gender-based
violence, food insecurity including
malnutrition, or mental health issues.
UNHCR disbursed $30.2 million in cash
assistance across the region, and 1 million
refugees, IDPs and other people of concern
received COVID-19-specific cash assistance.

Seeking durable solutions for
protracted refugee situations
With the exception of Burundi, most
facilitated refugee returns were
suspended as a result of the pandemic.
Returns in other locations such as Somalia
and South Sudan slowly resumed in the
second half of the year, with COVID-19
preventive measures in place. In total,
some 165,000 refugees returned to their
countries of origin during the year,
including over 40,900 facilitated returns
to Burundi and almost 122,000 selforganized returns recorded in South
Sudan. Some 600 Somalis were assisted
to return, while the rest who returned on
their own did so spontaneously.
The Solutions Initiative for South Sudan
and Sudan, involving both Governments,
led by the Intergovernmental Authority on
Development (IGAD) and supported by
UNHCR, was launched at the end of 2020
to advance comprehensive solutions for
both countries’ forcibly displaced
populations and to seek international
solidarity on early recovery needs.
The pandemic also severely disrupted
resettlement processes. Movement
restrictions and remote-working
arrangements resulted in a decrease
in the identification, interviews and
submissions of refugees in need of
resettlement. COVID-19 also forced
the suspension of departures for
several months, with only 4,831 refugee
departures facilitated by UNHCR in the
region in 2020, a 74% decrease.

UNHCR also submitted 9,179 resettlement
cases from the region for resettlement
consideration to third countries,
62% fewer than in 2019.

Ensuring protection and durable
solutions for IDPs
The 2019 “Policy on UNHCR’s
engagement in situations of internal
displacement” continued to guide
UNHCR’s coordination responsibilities
and operational response for IDPs in
Burundi, Ethiopia, Somalia, South Sudan
and Sudan. UNHCR’s protection
monitoring was, however, significantly
hampered by the pandemic.
In Burundi, broad-based consultations
undertaken by the UNHCR-led Protection
Cluster informed a new road map for
strengthening IDP protection. In Ethiopia,
UNHCR extended its leadership role
in the protection and other clusters to
the Tigray region, in response to
displacements following the outbreak
of conflict in November 2020. In Somalia,
UNHCR’s IDP response focused on
remote protection monitoring, community
engagement and risk communication.
In South Sudan, UNHCR significantly
scaled up shelter and other support for
IDPs affected by local violence, flooding
and COVID-19. In Sudan, UNHCR
increased its information management
capacity to support the Protection
Cluster with protection monitoring and
operational responses, as well as in the
Durable Solutions Working Group.
In Ethiopia, while there was minimal
progress in gaining access to the
displaced populations affected by the
conflict in Tigray despite coordinated
advocacy by UNHCR, humanitarian
partners and donors, UNHCR provided
protection and assistance to
400,000 IDPs across other parts
of Ethiopia.

Reducing and preventing
statelessness
The pandemic forced UNHCR to
reprioritize its efforts linked to the
eradication of statelessness in the region.
A significant achievement was, however,
realized in December 2020 when,
following extensive advocacy efforts
by UNHCR, Kenya announced a landmark
decision to grant citizenship to
1,670 stateless Shona and 1,300 stateless
persons of Rwandan descent. Other
significant achievements included the
adoption of national action plans to end
statelessness in Rwanda and South Sudan,
and the creation of a national statelessness
taskforce in Rwanda.
Furthermore, International Conference on
the Great Lakes Region (ICGLR) member
States endorsed a consolidated action
plan on the eradication of statelessness
in the Great Lakes in November 2020.
The implementation of this action plan
will bring positive dividends for ICGLR
members and support the implementation
of member States’ pledges made at the
High-Level Segment on Statelessness and
the Global Refugee Forum.

In 2020, TECNO, a premium smartphone
brand of TRANSSION Holdings, became
UNHCR’s first Chinese corporate partner. It supported
education in the Dadaab camp in Kenya, as part of the
joint Educate A Child programme from UNHCR and
Education Above All Foundation. In the context of
COVID-19, TECNO also donated surgical masks to UNHCR
in Kenya to support the COVID-19 response, as well as
tablets to support refugee children in Kenya’s refugee
camps with connected learning.

86 U N H C R G LO B A L R E P O R T 2 02 0

Lack of reliable estimates of the number
of stateless persons in the region,
particularly those with undetermined
nationality, remained a challenge in 2020.
Regional studies highlight serious gaps in
domestic nationality laws leading to
statelessness, and specific qualitative
profiles of groups at risk of statelessness
are known in Eastern Africa.

Implementing pledges made at the
Global Refugee Forum
While the COVID-19 pandemic has limited
multi-stakeholder consultations and
slowed the implementation of many
Global Refugee Forum pledges in the
region, a number of countries including
Ethiopia, Kenya, Rwanda, Somalia and
Uganda have made progress by
developing country-level action plans
and roadmaps.
In Burundi, the Agence Universitaire de
la Francophonie provided scholarships to
20 refugee students in Ngozi Province.
Uganda’s Ministry of Health worked with
stakeholders to support refugees’
inclusion in national health services,
accrediting about 70% of facilities in
refugee-hosting districts by year-end.
The Government of Uganda also included
refugees in the resource allocation
formula for refugee-hosting districts.

FINANCIAL INFORMATION
Consequences of underfunding
UNHCR’s financial requirements in the
East and Horn of Africa and the Great Lakes
region were 47% funded in 2020.
The impact of underfunding compounded
with COVID-19 seriously affected the
delivery of protection and assistance to
people of concern.
Operations were forced to divert precious
resources away from regular programmes
to respond to the pandemic. While
funding for the rollout of the new
gender-based violence policy was
secured, gender-based violence and
child protection activities remained
underfunded across operations, despite
a reported increase in incidents of
gender-based violence across the region
during the pandemic.
Funding constraints also affected the
provision of food to refugees, with WFP
food ration cuts affecting over 3.3 million
(72% of the total refugee population)
including in Djibouti, Ethiopia, Kenya,
South Sudan, the United Republic of
Tanzania and Uganda. Ration cuts
worsened the food security and nutrition
situation of refugees, causing increased
malnutrition in children and other
vulnerable groups. Negative coping
strategies such as skipping or reducing

meals, taking high-interest loans, selling
assets, child labour, and increased
domestic violence were also reported
as a result of food ration and cash cuts.
Limited support for livelihood activities
also affected refugees’ self-reliance,
leading to harmful coping mechanisms
and compounding protection risks.
Previous gains made in relation to the
self-reliance of people of concern in the
region were also negatively impacted
by the economic toll of the pandemic
on host countries.
Funding shortfalls meant that only 27%
of refugees in the region were able to
access distance learning programmes
during the prolonged school closures.
When schools reopened, refugee
students were slow to return due to
limited classrooms and a shortage of
teachers as a result of social distancing
protocols. Lack of water, sanitation and
hygiene facilities in schools continued
to hinder school reopenings and the
safe return of refugee students.
Despite new emergencies in the region,
including in the Democratic Republic of
the Congo, Ethiopia and South Sudan,
Refugee Response Plans across the
region remained poorly funded.

The humanitarian situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo remained complex in 2020, particularly
in eastern provinces. 5.2 million people remained internally displaced, while more than 861,000 Congolese
refugees and asylum-seekers were hosted in neighbouring countries. UNHCR strengthened its emergency
support in North Kivu, South Kivu and Ituri provinces, in line with UNHCR’s IDP policy. 44,429 IDP households
received cash grants for basic and domestic items. The situation was characterized by the large number of
IDPs, a complex security situation that caused repeated internal displacement, and limited resources for
humanitarian actors to provide protection and assistance to IDPs. These factors contributed to onward
displacement to neighbouring countries.
Under the 2020 Regional Refugee Response Plan for the Democratic Republic of the Congo, UNHCR led
66 partners in seven neighbouring countries of asylum to provide multisectoral assistance, protection and
solutions.
While humanitarian assistance was an essential component of UNHCR’s response, promotion of sustainable
livelihoods and inclusion of refugees into national development plans were also prioritized, reflecting the
whole-of-society approach of the Global Compact on Refugees.

KEY ACHIEVEMENTS AND IMPACT
Safeguarding access to protection
and asylum
UNHCR’s multi-year, multi-partner
protection and solutions strategy for
Southern Africa provided a strategic
framework in the region to ensure access
to protection and asylum. National
migration and asylum systems remained
overwhelmed and in need of strengthening
to manage mixed movements of refugees,
asylum-seekers and migrants originating
from over 90 countries. To address this,
UNHCR strengthened the quality and
integrity of registration and refugee status
determination processes by providing
technical and financial support. As the
pandemic restricted access to territory,
UNHCR successfully advocated for
keeping asylum open. The number of
people biometrically registered in the
region fell 10% due to the verification
exercise of South Sudanese refugees,
voluntary repatriation, spontaneous
returns, resettlement departures to third
countries and movements outside the
region. The pandemic also slowed
biometric registration.
UNHCR and the Southern African
Development Community (SADC)
established a five-year joint action plan
to support ratification of key instruments
by SADC member States, strengthen
research, harmonize processes and help
develop appropriate policies.
In the Republic of the Congo, a national
asylum law was under consideration by
the Government, while the Seychelles
requested technical support in drafting
a national legal asylum framework that
could serve as a model for other Indian
Ocean island States. Mauritius and
UNHCR agreed on standard operating
procedures to prevent refoulement,

98 U N H C R G LO B A L R E P O R T 2 02 0

facilitate refugee status determination
and identify solutions, while the Comoros
expressed its intention to ratify the
1951 Convention relating to the Status
of Refugees and the 1969 OAU
Convention Governing the Specific
Aspects of Refugee Problems in Africa.
In line with its strategy to address
mixed movements in Africa, UNHCR
implemented the first year of a four-year
joint project with the ILO, IOM and
UNODC to support SADC member States
in strengthening institutional mechanisms
for asylum and migration management.

Responding with life-saving
assistance
UNHCR provided protection and
multisectoral assistance to people of
concern and host communities affected
by new emergencies and protracted
displacement. Some 1.4 million refugees,
IDPs and other people of concern
received protection services.
UNHCR’s response was anchored in
national systems and development plans,
with cash assistance an integral element.
Cash assistance was introduced for urban
refugees in South Africa who could no
longer access socioeconomic
opportunities and for camp-based
refugees in Zambia whose livelihood
opportunities were severely affected by
COVID-19. Increased cash assistance
helped offset WFP food ration cuts,
which were seriously affecting people
of concern in Angola, the Democratic
Republic of the Congo, Malawi,
Mozambique and Zambia. 261,400 people
of concern received cash assistance to
mitigate the impact of COVID-19, which
caused over 1.2 million confirmed cases
in Southern Africa in 2020. UNHCR

programmes were adapted to observe
physical distancing, with health protocols
at registration and food distribution
points, and hotlines and community
protection structures to report protection
issues and assistance needs. UNHCR’s
response focused on communicating
about prevention measures, strengthening
health systems, reinforcing water,
sanitation and hygiene services, and
supporting isolation and quarantine
units, particularly in refugee camps
and settlements.

Seeking durable solutions for
protracted refugee situations
6,275 people were assisted to return
home in 2020, although border closures
prompted by COVID-19 forced UNHCR to
suspend voluntary repatriation operations
from March onwards. Tripartite
consultations continued between UNHCR,
the Government of the Democratic
Republic of the Congo and relevant
countries of asylum regarding the
voluntary repatriation of Congolese
refugees and asylum-seekers.
The Governments of Namibia and Burundi
and UNHCR initiated discussions on
repatriation of Burundian refugees from
Osire camp, with “go and see” visits and
intentional surveys planned for early 2021.
In Zambia, UNHCR continued its efforts
to help integrate former Angolan and
Rwandan refugees by supporting selfreliance and socioeconomic inclusion
and moving away from encampment
approaches. In Zimbabwe, the African
Development Bank funded a UNHCR
scheme to expand self-reliance
opportunities through agricultural
activities. In Namibia, some Angolan
refugees received legal assistance to
acquire permanent residence.
Resettlement in Southern Africa was
severely constrained by the COVID-19
pandemic, with third-country resettlement

decreasing from around 3,800 submissions
in 2019 to 1,371 submissions in 2020.
In line with UNHCR’s three-year
global strategy on resettlement and
complementary pathways (2019-2021),
UNHCR conducted training for
resettlement and protection staff,
including on family reunification,
educational opportunities, employment
opportunities, humanitarian pathways
and private sponsors.

Ensuring protection and durable
solutions for IDPs
By the end of 2020, the Southern Africa
region hosted around 6 million IDPs,
mainly in the Democratic Republic of
the Congo and Mozambique. Violence in
eastern Democratic Republic of the
Congo pushed the number of IDPs to
5.2 million by the start of 2021. UNHCR
allocated additional funding for shelter
in the Democratic Republic of the Congo,
improving the lives of over 175,000 people,
having identified vulnerable families
and durable solutions thanks to close
cooperation between Shelter, Protection
and Camp Coordination and Camp
Management Clusters. UNHCR also
sought to reinforce host families
by providing support for additional
rooms and housing on their land, and
by improving living conditions for
families who have been residing at
overcrowded sites for years by using
a villagization approach.
A deteriorating security situation in
Cabo Delgado Province in north-eastern
Mozambique displaced 530,000 people
in Cabo Delgado. Over 90% remained
in the province and others fled to the
neighbouring Nampula (9%) and Niassa
Provinces. UNHCR led the Protection
Cluster and actively participated in the
Shelter Cluster and Camp Coordination
and Camp Management Cluster.
UNHCR scaled up operations in northern

prioritized gender-based violence
prevention and response activities.

Reducing and preventing
statelessness
Positive steps were taken towards
reducing and preventing statelessness
in Southern Africa, although the pandemic
slowed progress. The Republic of the
Congo, the Democratic Republic of
the Congo, Namibia and Zambia made
progress towards accession to the
Statelessness Conventions with support
from UNHCR. Furthermore, UNHCR
provided technical support to the
Republic of the Congo and Eswatini,
following their adoption of national action
plans to end statelessness. Areas of focus
included reforming nationality laws and
enhancing civil registration systems.
National plans were awaiting formal
endorsement by Angola, the Democratic
Republic of the Congo, Madagascar,
Namibia and Zambia. Data collection
efforts on the risk of statelessness,
profiles and size of affected populations
in a number of countries were initiated
and supported by UNHCR. Legal aid was
provided to some 2,000 people of
concern in Madagascar, Mozambique and

REGIONAL SUMMARIES I SOUTHERN AFRICA

South Africa, with a view to providing
access to documentation or to confirming
nationality. Approximately 500 people of
concern had their nationalities confirmed.

Implementing pledges made at
the Global Refugee Forum
During the 2019 Global Refugee Forum,
the region demonstrated extraordinary
political will to support the Global
Compact on Refugees, with 69 pledges
covering refugee integration, registration
and access to identity cards, agricultural
land and work permits, higher education,
asylum procedures and legal frameworks.
States submitted additional pledges at
the Forum and the High-Level Segment
on Statelessness. Twelve States and four
organizations in Southern Africa provided
65 pledges, the second highest among
UNHCR’s seven regions. 70% of pledges
reported are at the implementation or
planning stage.
In Zambia, 1,054 refugee and host
community farmers were included in
national agriculture input support
programmes. More than 2,300 people
of concern have been registered in the
Zambia Integrated Agriculture Information
Management Systems, pending inclusion
in the Farmer Input Support Programme.
To further expand agricultural livelihoods,
700 farm plots were allocated to refugee
farmers in Mantapala.

EXPENDITURE VIA PARTNERS | 2020

FINANCIAL INFORMATION
Consequences of underfunding
COVID-19 compounded difficulties in the
region and obliged UNHCR to reallocate
from a chronically underfunded budget,
providing pandemic-related cash
assistance to 261,359 people of concern.

Across the region, COVID-19 kept
83,000 children out of school, but UNHCR
could only support 2,405 with distance/
home-based learning. In the Republic of
the Congo, there was too little funding to
build classrooms, pay volunteer teachers
and buy school supplies for children,
leaving overcrowded primary schools at
risk of COVID-19 and unable to provide
quality education.

The unmet needs were often acute: in
the Democratic Republic of the Congo,
only 25% of survivors of gender-based
violence received medical aid, 15% got
legal aid, and 1 in 200 got livelihoods
support. Across the country, UNHCR’s
assistance reached fewer than half of
those identified as having specific needs.
In the north-west, a shortfall in resources
undermined standards of health care for
Central African refugees.

In Angola, UNHCR had planned an
employment initiative for vulnerable urban
refugees whose undocumented status
made it hard to find work and access
basic services, as well as putting them
at risk of detention and exploitation.
However, COVID-19 made it impossible
for UNHCR to cover the needs of
extremely vulnerable families, forcing
it to halt the jobs scheme.

Underfunding also affected UNHCR’s
ability to meet basic needs in Dzaleka
refugee camp in Malawi, where
46,000 mainly Burundian, Congolese and
Rwandan refugees and asylum-seekers
Under-investment in agriculture and
occupied a site meant for 10,000. Access
livelihoods in Eswatini and Namibia
to clean water increased from 8.6 litres
derailed refugee self-reliance and
per day per person in 2019 to 12 litres, still
UNHCR’s planned phase-out of
barely above half the minimum standard
operations. In Zambia, most refugees
of 20 litres. The congested camp, relying
lived in dilapidated or inadequate
on a health centre serving 80,000 people,
shelters, and reception facilities were
posed a serious COVID-19 risk. Water

“

I don't need anything except education for my children.
—Aishetu, Nigerian IDP

”

Aishetu fled her village in north-east Nigeria with her eight children after her
husband was murdered by an armed group that threatened to kill her as well. Now
she lives in Bakassi IDP camp where she runs her own small shop selling snacks
and sodas. She not only provides for her own family, but also cares for 16 IDP
children orphaned by the same violence that left her a widow. She hopes that
through education, her children can grow and help those around them.

UNHCR and partners prioritized prevention and response to gender-based violence, shelter, core relief items,
education and environmental protection efforts. In line with its Sahel strategy, UNHCR increased
gender-based violence prevention and response programming, conducting safety audits and assessments
and setting up mobile clinics. 791 survivors received medical care and 825 received psychosocial support.
154,000 people got shelter support and almost 80,000 people of concern received core relief items.
UNHCR supported the intergovernmental Bamako Process which aims to enhance the protection
environment in the Sahel. Jointly with the Danish Refugee Council and over 20 other protection actors,
UNHCR also developed Project 21, a harmonized protection monitoring project piloted in Burkina Faso, Mali
and Niger to enhance evidence-based programming in the Sahel.

UNHCR maintained emergency assistance and emphasized medium-term responses including civil
registration, documentation, social cohesion, resilience and self-reliance. An adapted protection strategy
focused on access to territory and asylum, non-refoulement and prevention and response to gender-based
violence. UNHCR’s response provided 40,000 households with core relief items, and 20,318 people got
start-up materials, loans or training as livelihoods support. UNHCR monitored protection in all four countries,
with 9,247 protection monitoring missions in Nigeria alone. UNHCR led all four countries’ Protection Clusters
and the Shelter/Non-Food Item or Shelter/Camp Coordination and Camp Management Clusters in Cameroon,
Chad, Niger and Nigeria. UNHCR also led its sixth coordinated Nigeria Regional Refugee Response Plan,
bringing together 40 partners to provide life-saving humanitarian assistance, protection and resilience
programmes to almost 305,000 Nigerian refugees and their hosts in Cameroon, Chad and Niger.

providing food assistance in refugee settlements and coordinating out-of-camp approaches with local
authorities to strengthen national services and support displaced populations and their hosts in south-east
Nigeria. UNHCR distributed core relief items to 7,582 IDP households in Cameroon and supported
Government efforts to provide documentation to IDPs and returning populations, ensuring that 2,874 IDPs
received identity documents. UNHCR undertook protection monitoring and set up a gender-based violence
response adapted to COVID-19 and security risks.

UNHCR supported almost 5,000 Central African refugees’ return journey in early 2020, as the 2019 peace
agreement encouraged some refugees to voluntarily repatriate. But conflict erupted around December’s
elections, displacing 50,000 people and prompting UNHCR to suspend its voluntary repatriation activities
from Cameroon and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which had resumed in November after a
seven-month halt due to COVID-19.
UNHCR operations in Cameroon, the Central African Republic, Chad, the Republic of the Congo and the
Democratic Republic of the Congo scaled up their response with shelter support, core relief items, as well as
support for health care and water and sanitation infrastructure to respond to the pandemic. UNHCR also led
the Protection, Shelter/Non-Food Item and Camp Coordination and Camp Management Clusters to ensure
a comprehensive response.

REGIONAL SUMMARIES I WEST AND CENTRAL AFRICA

KEY ACHIEVEMENTS AND IMPACT
Safeguarding access to protection
and asylum
In 2020, UNHCR worked to maintain
access to asylum in all countries in West
and Central Africa amid widespread
border closures due to the pandemic.
Efforts to strengthen national asylum
systems yielded significant improvements
in Chad and Niger.
A new asylum law was adopted in Chad
that aimed to strengthen protection of the
483,000 refugees and asylum-seekers
currently residing in the country. It will
also guide the establishment of an
efficient national asylum system, pursued
under the Asylum Capacity Support
Group mechanism, and a fair refugee
status determination process.
A new technical committee to reform the
institutional and normative asylum system
in Niger was established.

Responding with life-saving
assistance
In 2020, UNHCR mobilized to respond to
the pandemic across West and Central
Africa. UNHCR supported the
construction of over 50 isolation and
quarantine centres and the rehabilitation
or construction of 60 health facilities,
including in Cameroon, Chad, Nigeria
and Senegal. It also helped to train over
500 community health workers and
200 health professionals across the region
and contributed to the rehabilitation and
equipping of 30 COVID-19 treatment
centres, including in Burkina Faso,
Cameroon, Chad, Guinea, Nigeria and
Togo. In total, over 1 million refugees
and other people of concern received
essential health care services across the
region in 2020.
The pandemic exacerbated many of the
protection issues faced by people of
110 U N H C R G LO B A L R E P O R T 2 02 0

concern in the region, prompting UNHCR
to innovate, adapt and reprioritize its
approach to assistance delivery. In
response to increasing reports of
gender-based violence, UNHCR
expanded its services and accessibility.
Mobile clinics were set up with teams
of specialists who provided medical,
psychosocial, legal and material support
to over 2,000 survivors by visiting safely
accessible locations. Remote services
were also made available by phone and
WhatsApp, and community-led activities
were strengthened to prevent child
marriage, female genital mutilation and
domestic violence.
After schools closed in March 2020
due to COVID-19, UNHCR quickly
developed and implemented distance
learning programmes that reached over
100,000 refugee, IDP and host community
children. Crucial support was also
provided for schools to reopen safely,
including water, sanitation and hygiene
interventions in 380 schools and the
training of around 2,000 teachers to
ensure safe practices. The return to
school was also supported through
community messaging, grants and cash
assistance, transportation allowances
and distribution of school kits.
Violence and civil unrest continued to
trigger forced displacement throughout
the region, and UNHCR continued to
provide life-saving assistance despite
the difficult context. More than
150,000 people received emergency
shelter, and over 300,000 received core
relief items. UNHCR was able to
biometrically register more than 1.2 million
people across the region in a COVIDsensitive manner by implementing
physical distancing policies, requiring
and distributing masks, and incorporating
additional sanitation measures.

Seeking durable solutions for
protracted refugee situations
Finding durable solutions remained a
priority across the region. Despite
security challenges, the Government of
Niger and UNHCR were able to close
Malian refugee camps in early 2020 as
refugees integrated in host communities.
This initiative was supported through
partnerships with development actors.
The multi-year Refugees and Host
Communities Support Project programme,
financed by the World Bank and
supported by UNHCR, benefited over
160,000 refugees and host community
members in Niger by funding livelihoods
opportunities and strengthening access
to basic public services. A total of
6,800 refugees in Chad received similar
support from the World Bank and the
Government of Chad, and similar projects
were underway in Burkina Faso and
Cameroon. In Chad, UNHCR continued
implementing its “alternatives to camp”
initiative, which works to sustainably
integrate new arrivals into host villages
and aims to convert 30% of refugee
camps into villages by 2024. In Ghana,
nearly 2,000 former Liberian refugees had
their five-year residency permits renewed
thanks to UNHCR’s continued advocacy,
allowing them to continue to work legally.
Although voluntary repatriation efforts were
severely impacted due to COVID-related
border closures and post-electoral violence
forced UNHCR to suspend its return
programmes in the region, UNHCR assisted
almost 5,000 Central African refugees and
around 330 Ivorian refugees to return
home in the first half of 2020. Additionally,
more than 5,000 Malian refugees decided
to return to Mali due to the dire security
situation in Burkina Faso, and were assisted
by UNHCR through documentation, a cash
grant for transportation, and a reintegration
grant upon arrival.
Despite travel restrictions linked to the
COVID-19 pandemic, over 990 of the most
vulnerable refugees in the region were

able to depart for resettlement in 2020.
This achievement was made possible by
the rapid rollout of COVID-19 prevention
measures and remote interview
procedures. Focused information sharing
and counselling efforts targeted those
affected by resettlement departure
delays. Reinforcement of anti-fraud
prevention, detection and response
mechanisms, in line with UNHCR’s policy
addressing fraud, ensured robust levels of
integrity within resettlement activities
across key resettlement operations.

Ensuring protection and durable
solutions for IDPs
The number of IDPs in West and Central
Africa increased by 28% in 2020, largely
due to escalating violence in central Sahel
countries, where some 1.1 million IDPs were
driven from their homes in Burkina Faso
alone. The Lake Chad Basin situation and
continued instability in Cameroon and the
Central African Republic were also major
drivers of internal displacement, and in
Chad, 336,000 people were internally
displaced in 2020.
In response to the situation in the central
Sahel, UNHCR and partners provided some
115,000 people with essential health care
services and almost 14,000 people (including
children, parents and primary caregivers)
with mental health and psychosocial
support. Around 13,400 households found
to be most vulnerable and affected by
COVID-19 were provided with livelihoods
support. In addition, around 106,300 people
of concern received shelter support and
some 15,906 households were provided
with core relief items and unrestricted
cash grants, while over 850,000 people
benefited from protection services.
UNHCR’s renewed engagement in IDP
responses is expected to help in
addressing critical needs, particularly
where there is a surge in internal
displacement, and to engage more States
on durable solutions where there are
protracted IDP situations.

Reducing and preventing
statelessness
Efforts to address statelessness
continued to bear tangible results in
terms of data collection, legal reforms and
research. A 2019 mapping exercise in
Côte d’Ivoire revealed that over
954,000 persons were stateless or at
immediate risk of statelessness,
highlighting the severity of the issue. In
September 2020, Côte d’Ivoire became
the first African country to establish
statelessness determination procedures.
This will allow stateless individuals to
access the rights enshrined in the 1954
Statelessness Convention. The
Governments of Nigeria and Sierra Leone
also adopted national action plans to
address statelessness.
In Mali, recommendations from the final
report of the study on statelessness will
help inform the country’s national action
plan. In December 2020, a stocktaking
event was convened by the Economic
Community of West African States
(ECOWAS), the Economic and Monetary
Community of Central Africa (CEMAC) and
UNHCR, during which a regional roadmap
was adopted to guide the implementation
of the pledges made at the High-Level
Segment on Statelessness.

REGIONAL SUMMARIES I WEST AND CENTRAL AFRICA

In 2020, 60 trainees from 30 countries
participated in the second statelessness
and nationality course in French, which
was organized by the Catholic University
of Central Africa and UNHCR in Cameroon.

Implementing pledges made at the
Global Refugee Forum
Of the 133 pledges relating to West and
Central Africa made at the High-Level
Segment on Statelessness in October
2019 and at the Global Refugee Forum in
December 2019, one was fulfilled in 2020
and six are in progress.
Chad’s asylum law made it one of the
first countries in the region to fulfil a
pledge made during the 2019 Global
Refugee Forum. The law ensures
fundamental protections for refugees
and asylum-seekers, including freedom
of movement, the right to work and
access to health care, education, and
justice, and conforms to international
standards enshrined in the 1951 Refugee
Convention and its Protocol and the
1969 OAU Convention on Refugees.
The Asylum Capacity Support Group
reinforced the capacities of Chad and
Niger's asylum systems, with the support
of France.

FINANCIAL INFORMATION
Consequences of underfunding

lack of funding. Despite increased health
needs due to the COVID-19 pandemic,
there were 40 health centres in
Cameroon that UNHCR was not able to
financially support.

The effects of underfunding were
reflected in the response to the COVID-19
emergency. Throughout the region,
operations struggled to mobilize
resources to respond to the secondary
effects of the health crisis: an increase
in incidence of gender-based violence,
a rapid reduction in livelihoods
opportunities, and thousands of displaced
children out of school due to the
pandemic.

The effects of underfunding were also
significant in the Nigeria situation.
An estimated 36,000 IDPs in Niger’s Diffa
region were not registered due to lack of
funding. In Nigeria, of nearly 210,000 IDP
households surveyed, more than 20%
were living in damaged or makeshift
shelters.

In 2020, underfunding in the Central
African Republic meant that two out of every
three IDPs (more than 400,000 people)
were not able to receive important core
relief items and shelter support. Cameroon
hosted more than 316,000 Central African
refugees by the end of 2020, but over
60% did not receive food assistance,
30% did not have access to safe drinking
water, and 34% of refugees still lived in
substandard emergency shelters due to a

The repercussions of underfunding
were profoundly felt in the Sahel. While
violence and the COVID-19 pandemic
kept thousands of displaced children out
of school in the region, 80% did not have
access to distance learning programmes.
In Mali, UNHCR was only able to address
the shelter and core relief item needs of
30% of the displaced population.

85,000 individuals supported
with reception.

Economic, political, humanitarian, social and climatic factors—combined with chronic gang violence,
human rights violations and food insecurity—prompted large mixed movements and a steady exodus of
individuals, families and unaccompanied children. Mexico registered 41,303 asylum claims in 2020,
58% of the 2019 figure, but substantially higher than in 2018 when the Mexican Commission for Refugee
Assistance registered 29,600 claims. With forced displacement increasing pressure on national
protection and asylum systems regionally, the Comprehensive Regional Protection and Solutions
Framework (known as MIRPS for its Spanish acronym) sought to expand the operational capacity
of Belize, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico and Panama to respond and find
solutions. During El Salvador’s rotating presidency, as part of the Global Refugee Forum commitments,
a MIRPS Support Platform was created, with Spain currently holding the presidency.

COVID-19, new internal displacement and violence by irregular armed groups limited progress on
solutions for IDPs. COVID-19-related restrictions constrained humanitarian access, as did irregular
armed groups, who exerted control over communities and restricted the mobility of 61,450 people.
Indigenous and Afro-Colombian communities along the Pacific Coast and in border areas were
particularly affected. Despite national efforts to implement the Peace Agreement, the UN verification
mission in Colombia reports 378 community leaders were killed since 2016. Also, according to OCHA,
165 people were victims of anti-personnel mines in 2020.
UNHCR complemented Colombia’s institutional response, providing life-saving assistance and
conducting protection monitoring. Collaboration with the Ombudsperson, local authorities and
communities allowed the legalization of 18 informal settlements hosting IDPs and refugees and migrants
from the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela.

The outflow of over 5 million refugees and migrants from the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela
represents the world’s second-largest external displacement crisis. The COVID-19 pandemic
exacerbated risks, and many displaced Venezuelans lost their jobs and could not afford food or shelter.
Facing eviction, exploitation and abuse, with limited or no access to health care or social protection,
around 130,000 saw no option but to return when the pandemic struck, but increasing numbers left again
as restrictions on movement eased. With borders still closed, movements were mostly irregular, adding to
the risks. Within the country, UNHCR assisted 600,000 people at risk of displacement, on the move or
returning in 2020.
UNHCR and IOM led the Regional Inter-Agency Coordination Platform, coordinating the response for
3.18 million refugees and migrants from the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela and host communities in
17 Latin American and Caribbean countries. UNHCR also boosted the Quito process and the organization
of a donor conference that pledged $2.8 billion in loans and donations for host governments and
humanitarian partners.

With borders closed, the number of Nicaraguans seeking international protection grew slightly in 2020,
despite COVID-19 and tropical storms compounded with a complex political and socioeconomic
situation. In Costa Rica, UNHCR helped 6,537 Nicaraguan households with cash assistance.
COVID-19-related border restrictions added risks to the use of irregular routes and limited the possibility
to access asylum. Despite the efforts of host governments, the economic downturn caused by the
pandemic prompted return movements in adverse conditions to Nicaragua.
UNHCR and partners sought to strengthen asylum systems in host countries, with cash assistance and
Nicaraguans’ inclusion in public health systems helping to facilitate their socioeconomic integration.

KEY ACHIEVEMENTS AND IMPACT
For more
information on
protection and
solutions in Central
America and Mexico,
see Chapter 4
of the 2020 Global
Trends report

Safeguarding access to protection
and asylum
UNHCR bolstered stretched asylum
systems in the context of the pandemic.
To contain COVID-19, governments in the
region restricted movements, curtailed
entry into their territory, and in some
cases suspended or postponed asylum
procedures, eligibility interviews and
registration services. UNHCR promoted
the adoption of innovative methods and
technology to ensure access to asylum.
Argentina, Ecuador, El Salvador, Mexico
and Uruguay, among others, developed
remote registration and eligibility
interviews, while the Plurinational State of
Bolivia, Colombia, Costa Rica and Panama
extended the validity of personal
documentation and/or work permits
of asylum-seekers via an online
system. Colombia, Ecuador and Peru
extended the regularization process
for Venezuelans.
Community outreach was expanded
and UNHCR contributed to 187 support
spaces across the region, providing
information and essential services, as well
as identification and referrals of persons
at heightened risk. As the number of
gender-based violence incidents
increased in the region, the operations
had to quickly adapt to increase
aid offered to survivors of around
10,700 incidents through remote
services, a 400% increase versus 2019.

Responding with life-saving
assistance
UNHCR operations reacted quickly to the
COVID-19 crisis with emergency
assistance and engaged with various

122 U N H C R G LO B A L R E P O R T 2 02 0

stakeholders to seek longer-term
solutions. Lack of documentation
hindered access to basic services and
often to health services. With refugees
and migrants largely dependent upon the
informal sector of the economy, up to 80%
of refugees in the region are estimated to
have lost their jobs in 2020 as a result of
the pandemic. Protection risks rocketed
up, particularly among vulnerable
population groups, and UNHCR quickly
adapted its services to prevent the risk
of transmission, while maintaining
identity-checking and anti-fraud
mechanisms. As a result, 574,000 people
received assistance after being registered
by UNHCR and partners, a 238% increase
versus 2019.
Cash assistance increased in its scope
and reach and new delivery methods
were added, with 374,000 people helped
to afford shelter, food, water, electricity
and transportation.
UNHCR stepped up its shelter response
in border areas and in urban centres
across 15 countries to reinforce
652 collective facilities, with the
rehabilitation and improvement of
temporary collective shelters, access
to rental schemes and hotels for people
suffering from evictions after losing
their income, and the construction of
community infrastructure. In Tapachula
(Mexico) the first shelter receiving
only refugees and asylum-seekers
was opened.
UNHCR furthered health authorities’
pandemic response with the expansion,
renovation and/or construction of health
infrastructure through 264 projects.
In Ecuador, 183 refugee housing units
were installed in 80 health centres and

24 hospitals to be used as resting, triage
and isolation areas. Facilities receiving
people in mixed movements in Panama
were improved with the use of 48 refugee
housing units. Around 77,000 people
in dire need in the Bolivarian Republic
of Venezuela benefited from the
rehabilitation of 58 spaces such as
temporary accommodation shelters,
health care centres, schools, common
spaces for the communities and shelter
facilities for children, women and elderly.

Seeking durable solutions for
protracted refugee situations
In a challenging scenario due to the severe
socioeconomic impact of the pandemic,
UNHCR worked with governments,
communities, partners, development
actors, the private sector, and international
financial institutions towards the inclusion
of refugees and migrants in national
recovery plans and protection systems.
Over 75,000 people affected by the
economic shock caused by the pandemic
received support to access jobs, run a
business or have better opportunities
for livelihoods.
The MIRPS and the Quito Process made
“inclusion” one of their agenda items.
In Ecuador, UNHCR advocacy resulted
in regulatory changes that allowed asylumseekers to open bank accounts with their
country of origin identification document.
In several countries in the region, such as
Mexico and Peru, refugees and asylumseekers with medical training were
employed to help cope with the pandemic.
Despite the restrictions imposed during the
pandemic, UNHCR identified, processed,
and referred cases for resettlement
programmes and for the protection transfer
arrangements implemented in El Salvador,
Guatemala and Honduras.

New pilot resettlement programmes were
developed in Colombia and Peru for
refugees from the Bolivarian Republic of
Venezuela. Additional third-country
solutions, involving employment and
education schemes, were explored with
Canada to facilitate complementary
pathways for skilled refugees from the
Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela in
countries of the Andean region.

Ensuring protection and durable
solutions for IDPs
The Americas is home to around 8.6 million
IDPs, whose lives worsened because of the
impact of the pandemic. Under the 2019
Policy on UNHCR's Engagement in
Situations of Internal Displacement,
UNHCR bolstered the development
of national legislation and policies in
El Salvador, Honduras and Mexico in 2020.
As part of the Office’s role in the MIRPS
technical secretariat, together with the
Organization of American States, UNHCR
reinforced technical capacities of the
Working Group on International
Displacement, which brought together
El Salvador, Honduras and Mexico, assisted
by a high-level expert panel from
Colombia. It held four work sessions and
adopted policy recommendations on the
use of information systems, planning and
resource allocation and inter-institutional
coordination.
UNHCR and the San Remo International
Institute on Humanitarian Law organized
training for government officials from
Mexico and Central American countries.
UNHCR contributed to an initiative
launched by the Protection Cluster,
marking the 20th anniversary of the Guiding
Principles on Internal Displacement, by
sharing lessons learned in the Regional
Exchange on Preventing and Addressing
Internal Displacement in the Americas.

The Office rapidly responded to the
needs of those suffering the devasting
impact of Tropical Storm Eta and
Hurricane Iota in Honduras, many of
whom were IDPs or at risk due to the
deteriorating security situation and
violence in their communities. In
Colombia, progress in legalizing informal
settlements—inhabited by Colombian
IDPs and returnees and Venezuelan
refugees and migrants—represented
important steps towards solutions.
Colombia’s Victims and Land Restitution
Law was also extended until 2031.

Reducing and preventing
statelessness
UNHCR strengthened its partnership with
the Organization of American States’
Universal Civil Identity Program in the
Americas, and the Latin American and
Caribbean Council for Civil Registration,
Identity and Vital Statistics. This
partnership helped towards achieving full
access to documentation and civil registry
services by people of concern and
enhancing the capacity of national civil
registries for the prevention and
reduction of statelessness. As part of this
collaboration, two joint reports were
published: “Emergency response of civil
registry and identification offices during
the COVID-19 pandemic: good practices,
mechanisms and facilities implemented in
the Americas”, and “Regional study on
late birth registration, issuance of
nationality documentation and
statelessness”.

UNHCR implemented community-based
initiatives to prevent displacement and
protect those at heightened risk, such as
children, youth, and community leaders.
In El Salvador, the Active Families
initiative helped 120 families of eight highrisk communities to gain awareness on
rights of the displaced population,
protection of children and prevention
of gender-based violence.

REGIONAL SUMMARIES I THE AMERICAS

In Colombia, 50,791 children born in
Colombia to Venezuelan parents acquired
Colombian nationality by December 2020.
Through the “Primero la Niñez” project,
Mexico modified its constitution to allow
the transfer of nationality by jus sanguinis
to children of naturalized parents.

Banco Itaú supports operation of
a field hospital in Boa Vista, Brazil
Banco Itaú, one of the largest Brazilian
banks, partnered with UNHCR to support the
COVID-19 response plan for Venezuelans developed jointly
by Operação Acolhida, the Brazilian Federal Response for
Venezuelans, UN agencies and civil society, with the aim of
assisting displaced Venezuelans. The partnership with Itaú
provided multifaceted support towards the opening of a
Field Hospital in Boa Vista: in-kind donation of hospital
equipment and medication worth over $2 million, funding
for medical staff and protection items for COVID-19
prevention in the Amazonian region ($440,000) and full
review of the hospital’s medical protocols, endorsed by a
leading Brazilian hospital (Hospital Sirio-Libanês).

Implementing pledges made at
the Global Refugee Forum
UNHCR furthered States and other actors
in the implementation of the pledges
submitted at the Global Refugee Forum
and the High-Level Segment on
Statelessness in the areas of asylum
capacity-building, education, civil
registration, jobs and livelihoods,
infrastructure, access to services and
inclusion on national systems and
solutions and statelessness. As such,
the Mexican national system for children
and adolescents harmonized child,
migration, and asylum legislation to
eliminate child detention. Under the
UNICEF-UNHCR blueprint, joint action
plans were drafted in Ecuador and
Honduras to benefit child asylum-seekers,
refugees, returnees and IDPs with
increased access to education, better
water, sanitation and hygiene,
and specialized protection services.
As chair of the MIRPS Support Platform,
Spain coordinated the provision of
technical assistance and the exchange
of good practice towards strengthening
asylum systems in MIRPS countries.

FINANCIAL INFORMATION
Consequences of underfunding
The pandemic prompted UNHCR to
re-prioritize activities to provide
life-saving cash assistance or shelter
to destitute refugees and the displaced
population. Rather than suspend
in-person activities to comply with
health measures, it reshaped its services,
operating protection and legal services
remotely, and re-assigning funds from
longer-term programmes towards
life-saving needs.
The stretched budget meant start-up
grants could not be offered to
4,000 refugees and migrants in Brazil.
Nor could UNHCR assist 36,000 Colombian,
Nicaraguan and Venezuelan people of
concern with emergency unrestricted
cash assistance or core relief items in
border and urban reception areas in
Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica
and Ecuador. Consequently, they lacked
access to food, medicines or housing, and
many resorted to sex for survival or
endured abusive work conditions.

UNHCR was unable to set up national call
centres and relied on individual partners
and staff mobile numbers to serve
refugees and migrants across Colombia,
Ecuador and Peru. In Colombia, a threemonth pilot with a professional service
provider was launched in the border city
of Cúcuta, though the lack of funds
prevented its expansion to other locations.
As countries struggled to make civil
registration COVID-19-compliant,
UNHCR’s technical and material support
might have reduced the potential for
statelessness for new-borns of refugee
and migrant parents, particularly in the
Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, but also
for children of Venezuelan parents in
other countries.
UNHCR sought to support safe houses for
persons at heightened risk in El Salvador,
Guatemala and Honduras, but the
challenge of COVID-19 prevention meant
some struggled to stay open, and there
was no funding for new ones.
Although indigenous people, AfroColombian people, women, LGBTIQ+
persons and youth were

“

This infrastructure has been a great support for the people of
Cox’s Bazar, but also the people of this entire region. This is the
only ICU unit for the entire district—not only for COVID-19, but also
for any other medical emergencies.

”

—Dr. Kafil Uddin Abbas, head of the ICU in Cox’s Bazar, Bangladesh

In 2020, one of the key priorities of UNHCR was to improve emergency health
services to ensure access to health facilities, especially for COVID-19, for both
Rohingya refugees and host communities in Bangladesh. Huge strides were made
in the establishment of two COVID-19 hospitals and Cox’s Bazar’s first intensive care
unit in the Government-run hospital.

UNHCR pursued comprehensive approaches to solutions for the displaced and stateless of Myanmar and sought
to create conditions conducive to voluntary repatriation of refugees. UNHCR and UNDP implemented
community-based projects in Rakhine State to expand all communities’ access to education, livelihoods and
health care. UNHCR advocated for implementing the 2017 recommendations of the Advisory Commission on
Rakhine State, particularly lifting discriminatory restrictions on freedom of movement and citizenship for the
600,000 Rohingya who remain in Rakhine State. Outside of Myanmar, UNHCR led efforts to protect and assist
Rohingya refugees across the region. Humanitarian organizations worked closely with the Government of
Bangladesh to implement COVID-19 mitigation measures for the 867,000 Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh.
A total of 15,423 individuals were registered during the year.
As the situation becomes protracted, however, a range of challenges have risen, including security challenges in
Bangladesh, increased detention of refugees in Malaysia, and refusal of several States to rescue and disembark a
growing number of Rohingya who undertake life-threatening journeys by sea.

Despite escalating violence, intra-Afghan peace negotiations presented an opportunity to progress towards
peace, stability, and voluntary repatriation of refugees. The Core Group of the Solutions Strategy for Afghan
Refugees (SSAR) Support Platform was formed, with 13 members aiming to mobilize political, financial, technical
and strategic support for implementing the SSAR. UNHCR and its partners assisted over 900,000 people of
concern in priority areas for return and reintegration (PARRs).
In the Islamic Republics of Iran and Pakistan, together hosting 2.2 million registered Afghan refugees, UNHCR
supported inclusive Government policies by channelling investment into the national public service delivery
systems and by securing documentation for refugees. This helped make protection and assistance more effective
and meant better targeted investments to facilitate sustainable return and reintegration in the PARRs in
Afghanistan. During the year, UNHCR facilitated 2,314 Afghan returns.

**The increase in cash assistance in the region in 2016 is explained by a significant increase in voluntary repatriation of Afghan refugees from Pakistan that year (over
370,000, the highest annual total since 2005). Under the voluntary repatriation programme, returning refugees receive a cash grant to aid their repatriation and reintegration.

KEY ACHIEVEMENTS AND IMPACT
Safeguarding access to protection
and asylum
In Asia and the Pacific, most countries
were quick to include refugees and
asylum-seekers in their COVID-19
responses, while working with UNHCR
on prevention measures and equal access
to testing and treatment. Sweeping
restrictions on movement and the
significant socioeconomic impact of the
pandemic exacerbated refugees’ plight,
however. Often excluded from education,
livelihoods, and social safety nets, they
faced protection risks such as xenophobic
hate speech, limited access to asylum,
pushbacks at sea, stringent detention
measures, increased domestic violence,
child protection concerns and mental
health issues.
UNHCR, partners and people of concern
adapted their means of responding to
protection needs during lockdowns.
To maintain access to asylum and
essential protection services, UNHCR’s
operations in Asia and the Pacific adopted
remote tools for community outreach,
registration, status determination and
resettlement processing. With support
and training from UNHCR and its partners,
refugees themselves continued to lead
community-based protection initiatives,
serving as front-line responders not
only for COVID-19 but also for broader
protection matters and in natural disaster
preparation.
Access to territory and asylum remained
a challenge. In Asia and the Pacific,
only 20 of the 45 countries and territories
have acceded to the 1951 Convention
relating to the Status of Refugees, and
many asylum-seekers seek access to
territory by air, an option curtailed by

136 U N H C R G LO B A L R E P O R T 2 02 0

COVID-19-related travel restrictions.
When individuals sought asylum by sea in
2020, as was the case for an estimated
2,400 Rohingya refugees, the lack of
predictable and equitable regional
mechanisms for disembarkation resulted
in vessels being stranded at sea for
months, repeated abuses by smugglers
and traffickers, and the loss of as many
as 200 lives.
In 2020, progress was made towards
developing national asylum systems.
Thailand established a national screening
mechanism, although implementation
was delayed partly due to the pandemic.
UNHCR provided capacity-building and
technical support for asylum systems
across the region.
UNHCR strengthened documentation
securing refugees’ rights, including legal
stay, and broadened their inclusion in
national systems while in exile and upon
return home. In the Islamic Republic of
Iran, for example, UNHCR supported the
Amayesh XV exercise, which expanded
the eligibility criteria for identity
document renewal to include Afghan
refugees who missed previous rounds
of registration.
Across the region, UNHCR implemented
activities to prevent and respond to risks
of child protection and gender-based
violence, including sexual exploitation
and abuse. In Bangladesh, Malaysia and
Thailand, UNHCR’s extended support
to community-based organizations
reinforced community networks amidst
COVID-19-related restrictions. An additional
173 female refugee outreach volunteers
strengthened support for vulnerable
refugees, particularly women and girls,
in India.

Seeking durable solutions for
protracted refugee situations

Ensuring protection and durable
solutions for IDPs

The pandemic stalled the limited
opportunities for solutions in Asia and
the Pacific. COVID-19 had a severe
impact: hindering resettlement case
identification, processing and departures;
temporarily suspending facilitated
voluntary repatriation to Afghanistan,
Myanmar and Sri Lanka; and, in some
cases, triggering premature returns or
onward movements as individuals faced
difficulties in host countries.

With conflict-related internal displacement
in Afghanistan, Myanmar and the
Philippines, UNHCR advanced datadriven protection and solutions for IDPs
in line with its policy on engagement in
situations of internal displacement.

In 2020, UNHCR facilitated the return
of 2,436 individuals, primarily to
Afghanistan, significantly lower than
8,647 in 2019. Nevertheless, remote
processing modalities established by
UNHCR allowed some refugees in the
region to access third-country solutions,
including over 3,000 refugees who
departed for resettlement. UNHCR’s
advocacy added to momentum towards
complementary pathways in the region,
including the potential for small pilot
programmes in the Philippines and
the Republic of Korea.
UNHCR pursued comprehensive
approaches for Afghan refugees and
displaced and stateless Rohingya
from Myanmar, and continued to
seek solutions, including voluntary
repatriation, for the 92,000 refugees
from Myanmar encamped in Thailand.
UNHCR also worked with the
Governments of India and Sri Lanka
towards finding a dignified and
sustainable resolution of the situation
of over 93,000 Sri Lankan refugees
who have resided in India for decades.
This has included renewed focus on
supporting voluntary repatriation as well
as exploring opportunities for local
inclusion for those who may qualify
in India.

Afghanistan’s IDP population grew by
over 300,000 to 2.9 million. Increased
violence and the global health situation
drove up needs exponentially. UNHCR
took an area-based approach to solutions
for IDPs, consistent with its mobilization of
investments in the priority areas for return
and reintegration, while strengthening
community-based protection mechanisms
within displaced communities. This
ensures support for returnees and the
communities to which they return.
In Myanmar, UNHCR was part of wider
United Nations efforts to support the
2019 national strategy on resettlement
of IDPs and closure of IDP camps,
particularly in areas where IDP solutions
were achievable, such as in Kachin and
northern Shan States, which have
104,000 IDPs. UNHCR advocated for over
140,000 Rohingya IDPs in Rakhine State
to be allowed back to their places of
origin and delivered humanitarian
assistance to 106,000 others displaced
in Rakhine and Chin States since 2018.
In the Philippines, UNHCR nationalized
its office as it transitioned from leading
the protection cluster in Mindanao. In
coordination with the Government and
other partners, UNHCR delivered core
relief items to over 60,900 individuals
and implemented some 40 quick impact
projects.

Reducing and preventing
statelessness
In addition to its efforts to protect the
region’s largest stateless group, the
1.6 million Rohingya denied citizenship
in Myanmar, UNHCR worked to reduce
and prevent statelessness throughout
Asia and the Pacific, supporting legal
and policy reforms that resolved
thousands of cases of statelessness,
particularly in Central Asia, where an
estimated 80,000 individuals’ nationality
issues have been resolved since the
#IBelong campaign began in 2014.
Kyrgyzstan’s more inclusive civil
registration law made it the first State
in the region to completely resolve
statelessness, while authorities in
Uzbekistan estimate that a new
citizenship law will allow 50,000 stateless
residents to acquire citizenship. In 2020,
some 28,400 stateless persons received
citizenship in Uzbekistan and 4,200
stateless persons acquired nationality
in Tajikistan. Kazakhstan adopted
statelessness determination procedures
and strengthened the legal basis for
comprehensive birth registration.
In the Islamic Republic of Iran, an
amendment to the nationality law enabled
children of Iranian mothers and foreign
fathers to obtain Iranian nationality.

FINANCIAL INFORMATION

Malaysia expedited its naturalization
procedures, the Philippines passed
legislation on the welfare of foundlings
and Thailand reduced administrative
requirements for civil registration and
naturalization. Civil registration
assessment studies were started in
Pakistan, Thailand and Viet Nam to
identify legal and administrative gaps
that increase the risk of statelessness.

Consequences of underfunding
In 2020, operations reprioritized
interventions and programme delivery
to respond to critical needs arising from
the pandemic. However, underfunding
hampered UNHCR’s ability to meet the
needs of vulnerable people of concern,
most of whom were not covered by
national social protection systems.

Implementing pledges made at the
Global Refugee Forum

In Afghanistan, despite efforts to support
reintegration in priority areas, return and
reintegration were hindered by a lack of
livelihood opportunities and access to
basic services, particularly land, shelter,
education and health services. UNHCR
could not provide improved access to
education, health, and community
infrastructure to some 280,000 individuals
due to lack of funds.

At the 2019 Global Refugee Forum, States
and other entities in Asia and the Pacific
made 120 pledges and other commitments
towards the objectives of the Global
Compact on Refugees. Despite the
pandemic, progress has been made in the
areas of jobs and livelihoods, protection
and solutions. In 2020, UNHCR supported
the convening of a business forum to
facilitate refugee employment, the
organization of a conference on women
and peace, and the provision of pro bono
legal assistance to refugee organizations.
UNHCR built on the full range of pledges
made at the Global Refugee Forum in the
region, pursuing comprehensive
approaches to solutions, expanding its
evidence base through more rigorous and
systematic data collection and analysis,
and expanding its network of partners.

Fast Retailing and UNHCR renew their
multifaceted partnership for another
three years

R E G I O N A L S U M M A R I E S I A S I A A N D T H E PAC I F I C

In the Islamic Republic of Iran, while
UNHCR made important progress in
ensuring refugee access to secondary
and tertiary health care, only 100,000
extremely vulnerable refugees were
enrolled into the universal public health
insurance, leaving many refugees
uncovered. An estimated 95% of refugees
in the five most refugee-populated
provinces experienced a decrease in
income and 46% could not meet their
basic needs. Twice as many vulnerable
refugees approached UNHCR for

unrestricted cash assistance in 2020 as
in 2019, but UNHCR could support only
10% of refugees.
In Myanmar, some 8,000 IDP families
experiencing long-term displacement
continued residing in shelters in need of
construction or rehabilitation in the camps
in central Rakhine State. In Kachin and
northern Shan States, programmes for
persons at heightened risk targeted only
the extremely vulnerable, leaving many
without any form of support. Shelter
activities were also affected, with a shortfall
of approximately 6,000 units in camps and
669 units in durable solutions sites.
In Bangladesh, UNHCR’s interventions
aimed to benefit both refugee and host
communities. Nevertheless, gaps
remained, most notably in water,
sanitation and hygiene, including latrines,
bathing areas, and faecal sludge treatment.
The water supply in Teknaf could not be
upgraded due to lack of funding.
In India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Nepal and
Thailand, UNHCR was able to provide
cash assistance only to a limited number
of people of concern requiring life-saving
emergency assistance. The vulnerability
of people of concern grew significantly as
the pandemic made it harder to find work,
children needed extra support and
equipment to study, and health needs
increased.

In 2020, Fast Retailing–the parent company
of brands like UNIQLO–and UNHCR renewed their global
partnership for an additional three years. This multifaceted
partnership includes support for the COVID-19 response
and other emergencies, contributions to UNHCR livelihoods
programmes, annual donations of up to 7 million pieces of
clothing, employment of refugees, and awareness-raising
initiatives. In addition to Fast Retailing’s cash contribution
of $1.5 million in 2020, a multi-year contribution of
$5 million was received from TTY Management B.V.,
owned by Fast Retailing’s chief executive officer,
Mr. Tadashi Yanai.

Fuji Optical continues to bring clear vision to
displaced communities
Despite COVID-19, Fuji Optical continued to support refugees
and host communities in 2020, including via funding to UNHCR.
Although the annual Fuji Optical Vision Aid Mission had to be cancelled for
the first time in 38 years, 1,500 eyeglasses were delivered to refugees in
Azerbaijan. Fuji Optical’s long-term commitment to refugees earned them a
special award from the Japanese Government as a leading Japanese private
sector contributor to the achievement of the SDGs. Dr. Akio Kanai, CEO of
Fuji Optical, optometrist and 2006 Nansen Award Winner, is determined to
continue supporting even as he approaches the age of 80.

Europe received 40% fewer arrivals via Mediterranean routes in 2020 as compared to 2019, with sharp
decreases in Greece, mainland Spain and Malta. However, arrivals tripled in Italy and increased almost
eightfold in the Canary Islands. The number of people reported dead or missing at sea rose by 5%.
In Cyprus, UNHCR supported the improvement of reception conditions, providing tents, beds, blankets and
sanitary materials. Efforts to enhance the identification of vulnerable asylum-seekers continued, while initial
steps were taken to develop best interests determination procedures for children. In Greece, arrivals
decreased by 79%. UNHCR supported COVID-19 screening, isolation and quarantine facilities, improved
water and hygiene conditions on the Aegean islands, and facilitated the relocation of the most vulnerable
asylum-seekers to alternative accommodation. In Greece, 2,209 individuals including 1,534 children,
574 unaccompanied, were relocated to several European countries.
In Italy, UNHCR worked towards disengagement from direct involvement in refugee status determination,
while enhancing its monitoring and supervisory role. UNHCR monitored reception conditions, conducted
outreach in formal and informal settlements, and continued to support resettlement and humanitarian
corridors. In Malta, UNHCR supported asylum authorities to ensure access to territory and asylum procedures,
while monitoring reception conditions to identify and respond to the specific needs of people of concern.
COVID-19 prevention and response efforts were also supported.

The population of concern to UNHCR remained stable. COVID-19-related travel restrictions led to a reduction
in asylum applications, while closed entry-exit crossing points in eastern Ukraine resulted in increased needs
in non-government-controlled areas (NGCA). The July 2020 ceasefire reduced shelling, but low-intensity
armed conflict continued. UNHCR continued the implementation of its 2018-2022 Multi-Year, Multi-Partner
(MYMP) Protection and Solutions Strategy, working with partners to deliver assistance on both sides of the
contact line. The lack of access to social protection schemes exacerbated the socioeconomic impact of the
pandemic on people of concern. UNHCR provided cash assistance to 1,572 extremely vulnerable households,
while phasing out large-scale cash assistance to IDPs. UNHCR also disengaged from shelter assistance in
government-controlled areas. The adoption of a new procedure allowed IDPs to vote in local elections for the
first time, while a law establishing statelessness determination procedures was adopted following UNHCR’s
technical support. In 2020, 173 people with undetermined nationality were assisted with confirmation of
nationality while 2,438 refugees and asylum-seekers received legal assistance.

In 2020, Turkey continued to host the world’s largest refugee population. The Government of Turkey took
important steps to include people of concern in its COVID-19 health response. To address the challenges
resulting from COVID-19 related restrictions, UNHCR and its partners increased the use of online and mobile
technology to maintain services and strengthen communication with communities.
The economic impact of the pandemic acutely affected refugees, many of whom work in the informal sector.
70% of those surveyed reported losing all or part of their income. UNHCR’s one-time cash assistance helped
nearly 80,000 of the most vulnerable households to cope with lockdowns and preserve economic assets.
UNHCR also continued its cash for protection assistance, benefiting 4,300 households. A total of
383,118 people with specific needs received cash assistance.
The pandemic had a debilitating impact on resettlement, reducing departures to a quarter of the number
planned. There were no significant developments allowing for large-scale voluntary returns to the
Syrian Arab Republic.

KEY ACHIEVEMENTS AND IMPACT
Safeguarding access to protection
and asylum
When European countries began
imposing restrictions to slow the spread
of COVID-19, adjustments were made
to asylum systems and procedures to
mitigate the effects of the pandemic on
access to territory. UNHCR compiled and
offered States across the continent a set
of practical considerations and concrete
advice to enable an effective response
to the pandemic, while respecting
international refugee law and standards.
Between the onset of the pandemic and
the end of the year, the share of countries
ensuring access to territory for people in
need of international protection, either
by law or in practice, rose significantly.
Overall, 66,194 people of concern were
provided with information on access to
and quality of status determination
procedures while 64,747 people of
concern received legal assistance.
In September 2020, the European
Commission proposed the new EU Pact
on Migration and Asylum, which UNHCR
welcomed as an opportunity to forge
common ground on asylum in Europe.
To support the negotiations and help find
workable solutions, UNHCR issued some
practical considerations on fair and fast
border procedures and solidarity in the
European Union, while undertaking
related advocacy with EU institutions
and Member States, including on the
development of predictable search
and rescue mechanisms.
In some countries, COVID-19 related
measures compounded existing
challenges in asylum systems, particularly
in regions experiencing mixed population
movements. Despite UNHCR’s efforts,
in 2020 just 4,600 individuals submitted

150 U N H C R G LO B A L R E P O R T 2 02 0

asylum applications in South-East Europe,
compared to 12,000 in 2019. UNHCR
took initial steps towards developing a
Quality Initiative to address structural
challenges and in support of the
development of fair and efficient asylum
systems in the region.
UNHCR continued its support to States
in Europe receiving the highest number
of arrivals. In the Canary Islands,
UNHCR increased its presence, assisting
authorities in identifying people with
international protection needs within
mixed movements. In Cyprus, Greece,
Italy, Malta and Spain, UNHCR helped
to improve living conditions in reception
facilities, benefiting 130,622 people
of concern.

Ensuring an effective operational
response
Throughout the pandemic, UNHCR
advocated for the inclusion of people
of concern in national health responses,
vaccination campaigns and social
protection schemes. It worked closely
with partners and civil society to support
people of concern, identifying their
needs and employing innovative methods
to provide information, protection
and assistance. Cash assistance was
expanded, targeting 520,383 vulnerable
refugees and asylum-seekers1.
In Greece, UNHCR worked with the
Government to quickly move
2,180 immuno-compromised individuals
from overcrowded reception centres on
the islands to safer accommodation.
Despite the pandemic, UNHCR’s planned
handover of the “Emergency support to

assistance programmes.

integration and accommodation”
programme (ESTIA) made progress with
86% of apartments transferred to the
Government by the end of 2020.
Following a fire at the Moria reception
centre on Lesvos, UNHCR supported
emergency assistance and shelter,
for 12,000 of those affected.
In Georgia, following several months of
hardship resulting from the closure of
the administrative boundary line, linked
to COVID-19 prevention measures,
joint efforts facilitated access of some
2,300 pensioners from Gali to pensions
and essential medicines by way of a
humanitarian corridor across the
Enguri bridge.
COVID-19 restrictions disproportionately
affected education for refugee children
and youth. Across Europe, UNHCR
supported distance learning and
facilitated access to electronic devices,
connectivity and study space. In the
Russian Federation, for example, UNHCR
worked with private sector partners to
supply 130 mobile phones to children in
asylum centres to allow them to follow
lessons online.
At the end of 2020, operational
engagement in Armenia and Azerbaijan,
in support of government responses to
the humanitarian needs of displaced
people, were scaled up in response to
renewed conflict with non-food items
distributed to thousands of individuals
through national partners in both
countries.

Community-based protection
COVID-19 resulted in increased
information needs among people of
concern, leading UNHCR and its partners
to expand communication and community
engagement through various channels
including new SMS, social media and
online platforms. In 43 countries IDPs,

refugees, stateless, migrants and
host communities were reached by
information campaigns about COVID-19
risk prevention. In Turkey, more than
11,200 people of concern received
information via WhatsApp. In Italy, the
information portal JUMA Refugees Map
Services and its COVID-19 information
pages recorded more than 130,000 visits
in 2020. WhatsApp and Viber groups
served as two-way communication
channels with communities in Georgia,
Malta, Moldova and Montenegro.
In Ukraine, a Telegram channel shared
daily COVID-19 updates with refugee
communities in six different languages.
Child-friendly information was developed
in Bosnia and Herzegovina and
Switzerland. UNHCR issued a paper—
“UNHCR, Risk Communication and
Community Engagement: Positive
Practices from Europe during COVID”
—outlining positive practices on risk
communication and community
engagement in Europe during COVID-19.
COVID-19 also prompted a scale-up of
mental health and psychosocial support,
as well as strengthened efforts to prevent
and respond to gender-based violence,
given the reports suggesting a higher
prevalence of gender-based violence
incidents caused by confinement
measures. In Serbia, psychosocial support
and language classes were offered via
Zoom, while a gender-based violence
hotline with translation services was
supported in Malta. A training module was
also developed for social workers working
with unaccompanied children in Italy.
Displaced communities themselves were
often at the forefront of the response
with refugees and other people of
concern contributing their time and skills.
In France, refugees initiated online social
activities to combat isolation, while in
Ukraine, IDPs conducted psychosocial
support and art therapy classes for

adolescents online. Across the region,
80 refugee-led and community-based
organizations were supported—up from
50 in 2019, including a child-led network
in Bulgaria.

Seeking durable solutions for
refugees and IDPs
In November, the European Commission
released its Action Plan on Integration
and Inclusion 2021-2027, an important
opportunity for systematic engagement
of refugees in meaningful integration and
innovative housing solutions in Europe,
with stronger access to decent work,
health services and education. In support,
UNHCR shared its recommendations
during the broad-based public
consultations, which included refugees
and migrants.
Working with partners in Ukraine, UNHCR
facilitated long-term housing solutions
for 1,938 IDPs and conflict-affected
individuals, while a new compensation
scheme for housing destroyed by the
armed conflict facilitated UNHCR’s
disengagement from shelter assistance
in government-controlled areas. In
south-eastern Europe, the Regional
Housing Programme continued with
UNHCR’s support, providing housing to
over 1,522 vulnerable households, with
a total of 7,805 households assisted
since its inception.

The pandemic significantly reduced
resettlement to the European Union in
2020, with only 11,150 departures
recorded against the 29,500 admissions
pledged. Nonetheless, certain member
States adopted new ways of working to
resume resettlement in the second half of
the year. 52% of resettlement submissions
to Europe included children.
Following the European Commission’s
call on EU member States to help
relocate unaccompanied children living
in precarious conditions on the Greek
islands, 16 countries pledged 1,587 places
for unaccompanied children and
3,288 places for other vulnerable
persons. By December, UNHCR, with
the Greek Government, the European
Asylum Support Office, IOM and UNICEF,
relocated 574 unaccompanied children
and 1,636 vulnerable individuals.
Relocation following search and rescue
operations also led to 860 places being
pledged and 241 transfers from Cyprus,
Italy and Malta.

“quality protection partnership”,
a joint initiative of the Government
and UNHCR.
Important steps were also taken by
Croatia, the Czech Republic and Denmark
to implement initiatives focused on
improving data and information available
on statelessness, with dedicated mapping
studies and legal analyses subsequently
published.

Albania reformed its nationality law,
providing for an unrestricted safeguard to
grant Albanian citizenship to all children
born in Albania who would otherwise be
stateless. In Ukraine, following UNHCR
advocacy efforts, a law establishing a
statelessness determination procedure
was adopted.
In the United Kingdom, an in-depth public
review of the Home Office’s statelessness
determination procedures, aiming to
improve the quality of the decision-making

Despite the pandemic, implementation of
Global Refugee Forum pledges advanced,
with 13% of some 350 pledges made by
European entities fulfilled by the end of
2020, and 66% in progress. The rate of
implementation of pledges made by
government entities reached 18%, with a
total of 43 commitments fulfilled by the
end of 2020.

In 2020, Unilever committed to one of the
largest in-kind donations ever received by
UNHCR, providing hand sanitizer, detergent and over
30 million bars of soap to help protect refugees from the
spread of coronavirus. In addition, UK for UNHCR joined
the Hygiene and Behaviour Change Coalition (HBCC),
created by Unilever and the United Kingdom’s Foreign,
Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) to respond
to COVID-19. As a result of HBCC funding, UNHCR was
able to reach over 20 million refugees and host community
members through increased hygiene promotion in
Bangladesh, Cameroon, the Democratic Republic of Congo
and South Sudan.

Reducing and preventing
statelessness
Of the 40 pledges made by European
States at the High-Level Segment on
Statelessness in October 2019, six were
fulfilled by the end of 2020. Notably,
Malta and North Macedonia acceded to
the 1954 and 1961 Statelessness
Conventions as pledged.

Seven European countries called for
foreign-born doctors and nurses to help
with the national response, and many
refugees came forward. UNHCR worked
closely with the Council of Europe and
national recognition boards to identify
refugee health workers and have their
qualifications assessed through the
European Qualifications Passport for
Refugees initiative. This process resulted in
refugees with health sector qualifications
being recruited into positions matching
their qualifications, while also facilitating
access to higher education.

Given the scale of the pandemic,
additional funds were needed in 2020 to

Nevertheless, and while programmes

UNHCR and partners delivered protection and assistance programmes adapted for COVID-19. Following
the Government of Iraq’s closure or reclassification of 15 IDP camps and informal sites in late 2020, UNHCR
increased its support to affected IDPs.
In neighbouring countries, over 240,000 refugees and asylum-seekers were registered with UNHCR, while
31,000 Iraqis without registration continued to live in camps in Al-Hassakeh Governorate in north-east Syria.

437,900 displaced Yemenis
reached with core relief items.

127,200 displaced Yemenis
received emergency shelter.

Yemen remained the worst humanitarian crisis globally, with 66% of the population requiring humanitarian assistance,
12.1 million of them in acute need. Famine and severe malnutrition remained a threat for 5 million Yemenis, with food
insecurity affecting 16.2 million people. Protracted hostilities, a continued blockade by coalition forces, a drastic
reduction in remittances and a long-running fuel crisis pushed Yemenis deeper into poverty. Some 1 million IDPs
resided in 1,600 IDP hosting sites, nearly half in close proximity to conflict areas. With no significant progress towards
a peace agreement, escalating hostilities and emerging frontlines displaced over 172,000 individuals. COVID-19
further impacted the already devasted economy and infrastructure, stretching the limited public resources and
straining the health system with a new layer of vulnerability. Yemen hosted 177,700 refugees and asylum-seekers,
mostly from the Horn of Africa. UNHCR provided protection services including mental health and psychosocial
support, registration and counselling for voluntary returns. 33,700 displaced Yemenis and 3,450 refugees benefited
from legal assistance while 7,300 refugee children were enrolled in primary education. UNHCR delivered $5.6 million
in cash assistance for winterization benefiting 187,714 IDPs.

The situation in Iraq continued to be unstable, with the country facing political and security challenges.
There were over 1.2 million IDPs. More than 278,000 IDP returnees continued to face protection risks and
constrained access to basic services and livelihood opportunities. The health and socioeconomic impacts
of COVID-19 compounded an existing economic crisis and exacerbated protection risks.

The Syria crisis entered in its tenth year, remaining the largest displacement situation in the world. Over 6.7 million
Syrians were still internally displaced, and 5.5 million were refugees in Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq and Egypt.
A joint UNHCR-World Bank study in Jordan, Lebanon and Iraq found that the socioeconomic impact
of COVID-19 drove 4.4 million people in host communities and 1.1 million refugees or IDPs into poverty.
A range of factors including COVID-19 hampered returns, with some 38,600 Syrian refugees returning in 2020,
a 60% decrease from 2019. Resettlement departures also fell by 60%, to 9,230. Within Syria, worsening economic
conditions and food insecurity increased the number of people in need. Movement restrictions, some related
to COVID-19, hindered humanitarian access. UNHCR and UNDP continued to co-lead the Regional Refugee
and Resilience Plan (3RP) in response to the Syria crisis, coordinating the work of over 270 partners.

$28.3 million in cash assistance
for 365,446 IDPs and 252,136
people assisted for winterization.

Libya’s socioeconomic environment deteriorated further amid its unpredictable security situation, but a ceasefire proposal
and a provisional unity government brought progress. 105,400 IDPs returned to places of origin but 278,200 remained
displaced. A 58% increase in sea departures from Libya was observed compared to 2019. The pandemic threatened the
welfare of people of concern, affecting health, education and livelihoods. 9,100 primary health consultations were provided
to people of concern, including 6,700 in the urban community, 1,900 in detention and 570 at disembarkation points.
UNHCR successfully advocated for the release of 389 people of concern in detention. In 2020, 13,050 individuals were
issued with UNHCR refugee and asylum-seeker certificates. UNHCR delivered medical equipment including ambulances
to support the COVID-19 response, enhanced its urban assistance package for refugees and asylum-seekers, providing
registration support, cash assistance, food parcels and hygiene kits. 15,880 people of concern received food assistance,
4,500 people of concern received emergency shelter while 21,000 people of concern received hygiene kits. The number
of asylum-seekers and refugees fell by 8% to 44,200, with 7,600 newly registered. UNHCR’s Emergency Transit Mechanism
facilitated the evacuation of 490 asylum-seekers to Niger and Rwanda, while 321 refugees departed via resettlement.

KEY ACHIEVEMENTS AND IMPACT
Safeguarding access to protection
and asylum
As COVID-19 hit, UNHCR strengthened
its efforts, its capacity and its advocacy
for people of concern to have safety,
dignified living conditions, and solutions.
This included enhancing communication
with communities and multisectoral
services, and face-to-face and remote case
processing and management. UNHCR
sought to develop its capacity to
undertake age and gender approaches,
and to sensitively identify international
protection needs in mixed movements,
trafficking and smuggling. In registering
individuals, it enhanced identity
management and data protection despite
the need to work remotely. In 2020,
there were almost 2.2 million individual
registration records in PRIMES proGres v4,
19% fewer than in 2019, while 3.1 million
individuals were biometrically registered,
10% higher than in 2019.
UNHCR advocated for non-refoulement,
alternatives to detention, and consistent
disembarkation procedures following
rescue at sea. It fostered understanding
of options for inclusion of people of
concern in available public services,
national systems for practical enjoyment
of fundamental legal rights and
protection. UNHCR strove to tailor the
use of digital communication and to build
communities’ protection capacity in ways
that took into account age, gender and
diversity characteristics as well as mental
health and physical needs. 137,012 people
of concern received mental health and
psychosocial support services across
the region.
The compelling situation of refugee
children and youth was characterized by
challenges in accessing education, with
thousands remaining at risk of dropping

164 U N H C R G LO B A L R E P O R T 2 02 0

out completely. During 2020,
429,256 children were enrolled at primary
level. Meanwhile, 35,648 were enrolled at
secondary level—nearly a 50% decrease
from 2019. 4,988 youth received
tertiary education scholarships—a 44%
increase from 2019. To support learners
and their families, UNHCR promoted
further alignment of digital learning
methodologies with livelihoods strategies.
UNHCR kept its attention on integrity,
anti-fraud and prevention of sexual
exploitation and abuse.

Responding with life-saving
assistance
The pandemic exacerbated already
precarious humanitarian situations in the
region. UNHCR stepped up to increase
national health capacity, so that refugees
and other people of concern could be
supported through national systems. This
included setting up over 75 isolation and
treatment centres, supporting them with
community health workers, and providing
medical equipment and personal
protective equipment. Across the region
5.2 million people of concern benefited
from community outreach services, while
2.6 million women and girls accessed
information on protection risks and
services.
Almost all the countries in the region
included refugees, IDPs and other
marginalized groups in their national
public health systems for the COVID-19
response. In total, UNHCR reached over
4.6 million people across the region,
disbursing $422.5 million in cash assistance,
covering ongoing cash assistance
programmes, cash for COVID-19 and
winterization support. Emergency cash
assistance for the COVID-19 response was
integrated into 14 operations, extending
existing regular cash programming to

meet new objectives, including rapid,
emergency-related scale-up, to mitigate
the socioeconomic impact of the pandemic,
supporting more than 1.4 million people
who had been self-sufficient prior to the
pandemic. Winterization support, which
remained critical in several operations,
was available in the form of in-kind and
cash provision.
The region accounted for a quarter of
UNHCR’s global procurement, with
$300 million spent locally. Large-scale
distribution of emergency core relief
items continued in Libya, Syria and Yemen.
More than 50 million core relief items
were handled, averaging 137,000 per day.
Across the region, women, girls, and
vulnerable people were at elevated risk
of gender-based violence, particularly
intimate partner violence and domestic
violence during lockdowns. UNHCR
provided support to over 30,000 genderbased violence survivors with psychosocial
counselling, legal and medical assistance. 

Seeking durable solutions for
protracted refugee situations
COVID-19 made face-to-face contact and
in-person case processing impossible in
many instances, so UNHCR developed
effective remote methods to ensure
continuity of resettlement submissions,
while upholding integrity standards and
protecting the health and safety of
refugees, staff and partners. As a result,
22,566 people were referred for
resettlement in 2020. Although this figure
marks a 46% decrease from 2019, all
available resettlement places were filled,
and all commitments were met during
the year.
UNHCR significantly invested in
complementary pathways in the region,
establishing a regional contact group as
an incubator for opportunities and a
channel to share ideas. The Middle East
and North Africa is the largest region of
origin, transit and hosting of people of

concern across the world, accounting for
50% of the global resettlement
submissions, and requires a
corresponding size of staffing and
capacity to ensure resettlement delivery
and integrity of processes. Voluntary
return remains the hope for many forcibly
displaced, and most IDPs and refugees
remained in situ. Sustained support to
host countries and assistance
programmes enabled people to make free
and informed decisions regarding their
present and future. UNHCR prioritized
investments to protect livelihoods and
advanced socioeconomic inclusion to
mitigate the impact of the pandemic on
the living conditions of people of concern.

Ensuring protection and durable
solutions for IDPs
Situations of internal displacement in the
Middle East and North Africa region
remained prominent and unfolded in
contexts of multifaceted refugee crises
and human mobility. The region’s four
major internal displacement situations,
namely Iraq, Libya, Syria, and Yemen,
accounted for around 12 million people
displaced by violence within their
countries, with many experiencing
multiple displacements. Syria remained
the largest IDP crisis in the world, with
over 6.7 million internally displaced. The
four crises called for a vast humanitarian
response which has become increasingly
interconnected with development
interventions.
The four IDP responses reflected
a focus on the centrality of protection,
evidence-based planning and
programming, area-centred and
community-based approaches, and the
importance of engaging individuals of all
ages, genders and diversity
characteristics. By applying a nondiscriminatory and participatory approach,
UNHCR advocated for equal access to
humanitarian assistance for all IDPs,
including persons with specific needs.

REGIONAL SUMMARIES I MIDDLE EAST AND NORTH AFRICA

Reducing and preventing
statelessness
The Middle East and North Africa region
is home to historical stateless
populations. Conflict and displacement
created new risks of statelessness. In line
with the regional strategy on preventing
and reducing statelessness, regional
priorities were geared towards access
to birth registration and civil status
documentation, removal of gender
discrimination from nationality laws,
accession to the Statelessness
Conventions, and improving statelessness
data in selected countries. States
undertook reforms to close gaps leading
to statelessness and resolve existing
situations of statelessness. However,
significant challenges remain. Issuance
of birth certificates and other civil
documentation to forcibly displaced
populations not only provides essential
protection but is instrumental in the
prevention of statelessness.
Operations expanded efforts in recent
years to prevent and reduce statelessness
through progressive inclusion of stateless
persons or those at risk of statelessness
in UNHCR’s programming. There is
increased recognition of the need to

166 U N H C R G LO B A L R E P O R T 2 02 0

enhance and rebuild civil registration and
vital statistics capacity in the region. In
2020, UNHCR worked with the League of
Arab States on statelessness and initiated
collaboration with the Organization of
Islamic Cooperation, while strengthening
global and regional partnerships. In the
3RP context, interventions by UNHCR
and partners reduced the percentage of
Syrian refugee children born in the region
without any form of identity documents
(either a birth certificate or medical birth
notification) from 35% in 2012 to 1% in
2020. In the 3RP context, the following
activities have helped improve birth
registration: making birth and marriage
registration procedures more accessible;
strengthening legal aid and counselling;
engaging with communities as agents of
change and ensuring access to quality
maternal health services.

Implementing pledges made at the
Global Refugee Forum
Of the 58 pledges to the region, 16 were
in progress, four have been fulfilled and
two are in the planning stage. Examples
of policy pledge implementation and
progress include Mauritania’s pledge to
enrol all refugees in its civil registry, issue
them with national identification numbers
and include them in national systems and
labour markets. In December 2020, the
Mauritanian Minister of Interior signed a
legislative act to issue refugee cards to all
refugees in Mauritanian territory.
In Morocco, a pledge to contribute
$300,000 for protection was also fulfilled.
In Qatar, the Thani Bin Abdullah Bin Thani
Al-Thani Humanitarian Fund contributed
more than $43 million towards UNHCR’s
work in Bangladesh, Chad, Lebanon and
Yemen, channelled through UNHCR’s
Refugee Zakat Fund and UNHCR’s
Sadaqah initiative.

In Syria, 70% of those receiving
livelihoods services through a network of
123 community centres were women and
girls. In Tunisia, children made up 41% of
the people served in the centres, followed
by people with diverse sexual orientation
and gender identity (11%), and persons
with disabilities (6%). In the Middle East
and North Africa, the humanitarian
response to IDPs included protection
interventions through cash assistance,
targeted visits, outreach volunteers, call
centres, social media, community centres
and emergency food and shelter
assistance. There were sustained efforts
and significant progress in offering mental
health and psychosocial support to IDPs.

REGIONAL SUMMARIES I MIDDLE EAST AND NORTH AFRICA

In 2020, H.E. Sheikh Thani Bin
Abdullah Bin Thani Al-Thani, through the Sheikh
Thani Bin Abdullah Bin Thani Al-Thani Humanitarian
Fund, contributed more than $43 million in support
of refugees and displaced people in Bangladesh,
Chad , Lebanon, Pakistan and Yemen in the form
of Zakat and Sadaqah funds through UNHCR.
This donation is the largest ever individual
contribution to UNHCR. For the second year in
a row, the contribution of the leading Qatari
philanthropist will be aiding millions and
supporting UNHCR’s efforts to protect and shelter
those forced to flee their homes.

FINANCIAL INFORMATION
Consequences of underfunding
Across the region, chronic underfunding
affected all operations. With the COVID-19
pandemic, humanitarian needs increased
significantly for refugees and host
communities as well as IDPs. UNHCR
received just 51% of the $2.8 billion
required which meant critical life-saving
and protection needs were unmet in
2020. While some instances of
underfunding were due to the new needs
resulting from COVID-19, many others
pre-date the pandemic. 
UNHCR was unable to meet the large
needs in the region, which were
compounded by currency devaluations in
Lebanon and Syria, coupled with
economic pressure from the pandemic.
With COVID-19, health care needs
increased substantially. Due to lack of
funds, UNHCR provided secondary and
tertiary medical care to a reduced number
of people of concern, including those in
need of specialized medical and mental
health support and those living with
disabilities, especially in urban areas.

unrestricted cash assistance to
approximately 800,000 individuals among
the prioritized target population in Jordan,
Lebanon and Syria. Despite additional
funding for COVID-19 prevention and
response, critical infrastructure had to be
deprioritized, and funding gaps became
more acute in refugee camps like Tindouf
in Algeria and Mbera camp in Mauritania.
The pandemic amplified protection and
financial challenges for urban refugees
and asylum-seekers in countries with
mixed movements such as Libya, Morocco
and Tunisia, prompting people to resort to
harmful coping mechanisms and exposing
the population of concern to higher risks
of exploitation and forced labour.
Yemen remained one of the operations
with the most tightly earmarked funding in
the region, leading to considerable
challenges in responding to the emerging
and increasing needs. Alongside lack of
funding, the limited opportunities for
durable solutions in host countries and
fewer resettlement places globally further
complicated the protection and
operational environment.

At the end of December 2020, UNHCR
could not provide support through

Safeguarding
fundamental
rights

In the year of the 70 th anniversary of
the adoption of UNHCR’s Statute by the
UN General Assembly, the drivers of forced
displacement multiplied globally, and
the COVID-19 pandemic jeopardized the
fundamental rights of people of concern.
Nevertheless, as the first year of
implementation of the Global Refugee Forum
pledges, 2020 presented opportunities
to further develop asylum capacity,
thus supporting States to cope with
challenging circumstances such as
public health emergencies.
Access to international protection and
safeguarding public health are not and should
never be mutually exclusive: States’ obligations
are not suspended in times of crisis.

UNHCR continued to advocate for full respect
of the non-derogable principle of nonrefoulement, while increased and often
violent pushbacks at the border and
interceptions at sea were reported, including
with returns to risks of persecution or serious
human rights violations. Throughout the
pandemic, access to protection and the
quality of that protection have suffered from
restrictive measures applied by States—with
limited or no flexibility towards those in need
of protection, and from the disruption of basic
services, socioeconomic shocks, increased
xenophobia, exacerbated protection risks
and humanitarian access challenges. UNHCR
upheld those countries who were steadfast to
their commitments and put in place adaptive
procedures to ensure their asylum systems
remained accessible and operational, while
simultaneously managing COVID-19
quarantine and treatment and undertaking
inclusive prevention and response plans.
Greater engagement with communities—
including through innovative tools
introduced by UNHCR and at inter-agency
level—allowed active participation of
forcibly displaced people and facilitated
their role as frontline responders. Age,
gender and diversity considerations
in all advocacy, policy and operational
interventions proved their worth in
responding to the COVID-19 emergency.

With a rise in risks, joint efforts were made
towards more inclusive child protection
systems, strengthened community-based
protection and mental health and
psychosocial support, as well as scaled-up
best interests procedures, birth
registration and strategies to address
childhood statelessness. A focus on
gender equality proved to be crucial
for tackling gender-based violence,
disturbingly higher during the pandemic.
Despite the challenges of timely
identification of persons with disabilities
and older persons in displacement
contexts, worsened by the pandemic
and its disproportional effect on those
at heightened risk, UNHCR advanced its
commitments on inclusion, accountability,
and collection and proactive use of
data through critical collaboration with
communities and other partners. Moreover,
to support the meaningful inclusion of
LGBTIQ+ displaced persons, UNHCR
enhanced partnership coordination
and advocacy on equal treatment,
anti-discrimination, participation, and
access to information and services.

Results and achievements
To advance the rights and legal protection
of refugees and other forcibly displaced
people in accordance with its supervisory
responsibility, UNHCR continued to
advocate for States’ accession to the
1951 Refugee Convention and its
1967 Protocol and their translation into
domestic law. By December 2020,
149 States were party to either the
1951 Convention or its 1967 Protocol,
70 of which maintained reservations and
declarations to one or both instruments.
UNHCR provided States with guidance on
interpreting and applying international
and regional refugee law standards
domestically. UNHCR also engaged with
UN agencies and legal, judicial and
academic partners and networks. In 2020,
UNHCR engaged with the legislative
processes of 93 countries: 23 countries
adopted laws or legislative changes, nine
of which represented advances in refugee

174 U N H C R G LO B A L R E P O R T 2 02 0

rights. Although COVID-19 forced many
courts to close temporarily, UNHCR
intervened as a third party in 18 cases in
10 jurisdictions.

Law and policy on internal
displacement
UNHCR supported the development of
national frameworks on internal
displacement by providing legal and
technical advice in 14 States, including
Colombia, Mali, Mexico, the Philippines,
South Sudan and Ukraine. Mexico’s
national legal framework, developed with
UNHCR’s support, was submitted to the
Senate as a draft law after unanimous
approval by the Chamber of Deputies.
At the regional level, Mozambique and
Somalia ratified the Kampala Convention,
with UNHCR helping translate it into domestic
law. In Somalia, a draft federal IDP Act was
presented in a validation workshop ahead
of review by the Attorney General.

To strengthen its engagement with human
rights mechanisms, UNHCR adopted a
“Human rights engagement strategy” in
October 2020, underpinned by a learning
programme to give staff the knowledge
and practical skills on human rights tools
to protect people of concern. Guidance
on UNHCR’s engagement with national
human rights institutions provided a
blueprint for leveraging partnerships
with national human rights institutions
to support UNHCR’s mandate and its
protection and advocacy work. UNHCR
complemented this with Guidance on
addressing racism and xenophobia,
focusing on responding to discrimination
against people of concern.

Operational highlights
Chad, hosting 483,000 refugees and
asylum-seekers, adopted its first ever
asylum law, guaranteeing fundamental
rights including freedom of movement,
the right to work, and access to health
care, education and justice. The law
makes Chad one of the first countries in
the region to fulfil a pledge made during
the 2019 Global Refugee Forum to
strengthen legal, physical and material
protection of refugees and asylum-seekers.
UNHCR supported the Government of
Chad in developing the law, providing
technical advice and written observations
throughout the legislative process.
In the Philippines, UNHCR provided
technical assistance for the development
of a regional legal framework for IDP
protection in the Bangsamoro
Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao,
in partnership with local organizations

and key UN and government agencies.
UNHCR formed a technical working group
and organized webinars for policymakers
and protection actors, with the support of
the Special Rapporteur on the human rights
of IDPs, key parliamentarians and the
national Commission on Human Rights.

9 States saw the adoption
of laws and legislative
changes demonstrating
improvements in refugee
rights. 2019 result: 16.

Challenges and unmet needs
Many countries hosting large refugee
populations are not States parties to
the 1951 Convention or its 1967 Protocol
and do not have domestic refugee or
asylum legislation.
While States often solicited UNHCR’s
views on proposed legislative changes,
those views were not always followed,
leading to legislation with reduced
protection safeguards, or provisions at
variance with the country’s international
or regional legal obligations. For instance,
of the 23 countries which saw the
adoption of laws and legislative changes
to their domestic refugee protection
framework, nine involved some
restrictions to refugee rights. In many
countries, legislative sessions were also
suspended because of the COVID-19
pandemic, causing delays including for
processes UNHCR was supporting.
Changes in government authorities and
institutions represented a key challenge
for adopting and implementing national
laws and policies on IDPs in various
countries, including Mali and South Sudan.
Lack of capacity to respond to IDPs’
legal needs and access to justice,
due to inadequate implementation of
international, regional and national
frameworks and standards, was also
a key challenge.

2019 result: 10.2 million.

9.2 million

individuals (5 years and
above) with biometric records
in PRIMES. Target: 10 million.
2019 result: 8.8 million.

Results and achievements
Registration establishes unique identities
for people of concern and is the basis for
delivery of protection and assistance and
for access to services. It also contributes
to identifying trends and patterns in
population movements.
Registration protects against refoulement,
arbitrary arrest and detention, and helps
to reunify families and trace separated
children. In 2020 however, the pandemic
and concomitant restrictions on
movement constituted a major obstacle.
In response, UNHCR adapted its policies
and guidance, instituting remote
registration arrangements across
41 country operations. New methods
included technologies that facilitated
refugees’ self-service, remote training
and simulations, and contactless data
collection. Biometric devices were
remodelled to enable contactless
biometric capture and identification.
Registration interviews were held via
video calls. Plexiglass dividers were
installed in registration facilities.
Despite the pandemic, in 2020 UNHCR
continued to strengthen its registration,

176 U N H C R G LO B A L R E P O R T 2 02 0

profiling and identity management
capabilities. At the centre of this work
was UNHCR’s Population Registration
and Identity Management EcoSystem
(PRIMES), which includes proGres v4,
a global, web-based source of information
about registered individuals, the
Biometric Identity Management System
(BIMS)/IrisGuard and the Global
Distribution Tool (GDT).
By the end of 2020, 100 operations were
using proGres v4, 10 more than originally
planned and 27 more than in 2019,
covering 15 million individuals, a 44% rise.
UNHCR achieved its Grand Bargain
commitment to roll out BIMS to a total of
75 operations, adding six in 2020.
Individual biometric records in BIMS
reached 9.2 million, up from 8.8 million.
The GDT was deployed in 20 operations
by year-end, up from 14 in 2019.
Employing such biometric tools means
aid gets to the right recipient swiftly and
simply, reducing the risk of fraud.
UNHCR made enhancements to PRIMES,
enabling its offline tool (RApp) to
consolidate inputs from multiple data
sources, allowing decentralized user
management, and launching a mobile

The emergency registration capacities of
eight operations were enhanced thanks
to the deployment of nine graduates of
the Training on Emergency Registration.
Additionally, 12 Danish Refugee
Council-managed registration roster
members were deployed to 10 operations
to conduct continuous registration,
population verification and/or prepare
for PRIMES deployment.

Operational highlights
In Jordan, to mitigate the risk of COVID-19
disrupting access to documentation,
UNHCR launched its first continuous
remote registration procedures in the
region. Data was collected in phone
interviews, with “know your customer”
standards to authenticate identities
remotely, instead of the biometric
information usually taken at registration.
A unique caller ID and a one-time
password, used during the phone
interview and for scheduling purposes,
further strengthened the integrity of the
process. Records were efficiently processed,
efficiently capturing information on new
arrivals, births and updated family
compositions. In parallel, a hybrid
asylum-seeker’s certificate distribution
mechanism—developed to complement
these remote registration procedures—
ensured the delivery of certificates to
266,586 individuals in 2020.
In Uganda, UNHCR and mobile operators
agreed on the interoperable use of their
systems for authenticating the identity
of people of concern to UNHCR. This
enabled the biometric authentication of
the identities of people of concern using

160,000 kiosks run by mobile network
operators. As a result, Ugandan
authorities allowed mobile operators
to issue SIM cards to refugees on the
same basis as Ugandan nationals.

Challenges and unmet needs
The number of individuals newly
registered in PRIMES fell 28% between
2019 and 2020 because of prolonged
restrictions on movement. Without remote
registration arrangements, including
technologies to facilitate refugees’
self-service, remote training and
simulations, and contactless biographic
and biometric data collection, the gap
would have been three times as large.
Support for developing a refugee selfservice platform, known as MyUNHCR,
was not provided as planned to UNHCR’s
Middle East and North Africa bureau and
Asia and the Pacific bureau, because
more time had to be invested during the
technical discovery and design phase,
resulting in development, piloting and
deployment delays.
UNHCR’s policy on registration and
identity management was not released
in 2020, as COVID-19 raised many new
issues, particularly for self-service and
remote registration, which must inform
the policy going forward. The policy will
be prioritized for publication in 2021 to
reflect these new registration and identity
management methods.

The same year that the implementation of
Global Refugee Forum pledges started,
due to the pandemic, States and partners
had to mobilize resources to adapt their
systems to ensure the continued
identification of people with international
protection needs.
As part of its global COVID-19 response,
UNHCR issued guidance on remote
interviewing of asylum applicants,
enabling States and partners to introduce
adaptations in national asylum systems,
while taking into consideration key
protection issues, as highlighted by
UNHCR’s protection dashboard. Of the
approximately 130 States applying a
national asylum/refugee status
determination (RSD) system, 98 adapted
part of their procedures at the onset of
the pandemic. By the end of the year,
123 States had adapted their national
asylum procedures in response to
COVID-19. Such measures helped address
public health concerns while maintaining

178 U N H C R G LO B A L R E P O R T 2 02 0

access to asylum and preventing
backlogs building up in national systems.
In parallel, UNHCR issued revised and
updated RSD procedural standards to
ensure accurate, timely and consistent
decision-making for operations engaged
in mandate-RSD activities. Following the
issuance of guidance on working
modalities of the Asylum Capacity
Support Group (ACSG), UNHCR facilitated
the launch of pilot projects within the
ACSG framework. Such projects aim to
assist the asylum authorities of the
countries concerned to assess gaps in
their process. They can then draw up an
action plan to address any lack of
capacity in the national asylum system,
implement simplified and accelerated
asylum processes, revise and improve
the national legal framework, and set up
professionalized country of origin
information units. These pilot projects
laid the groundwork for improvements
in the fairness, efficiency, integrity and
adaptability of national asylum systems.

As a result of the pandemic, certain
adaptive measures for national asylum
systems required States such as
Azerbaijan, Ecuador, Kenya, South Sudan,
Austria and Estonia and several other
European Union member States to
increasingly use physical distancing or
technology to issue new documents,
conduct remote asylum interviews or
court hearings. States such as Ghana,
the Russian Federation, Luxembourg and
certain other European Union member
States also extended by law, or practice,
the validity of expired or soon to expire
asylum documents. Portugal extended
the validity of documents and provided
access to health care, employment, social
benefits and financial services. These
adaptive measures effectively ensured
asylum-seekers’ access to protection,
despite a reduction of in-person services.

As this was the first year of the
implementation of Global Refugee Forum
pledges, 2020 also presented new
opportunities, in particular a renewed
focus on the importance of asylum system
adaptability and the ability of such systems
to respond to similar or different challenges
in the future. Political support and
investment in innovation, including the
provision of RSD services through remote
arrangements and technology, will be key
in enabling asylum systems to effectively
respond. Within the framework of the
ACSG, additional offers of support will be
important in ensuring that the needs of
States improving their asylum systems
are met.

While many States continued to adapt
national asylum processes in the context
of COVID-19, others took additional
measures, including using group-based
responses to strengthen the fairness,
efficiency and adaptability of the
protection response to large-scale
movements. One such example was
Sudan’s prima facie declaration for
Ethiopian refugees.

Challenges and unmet needs
While the impact of COVID-19 is not
yet fully understood, the complete
suspension or only partial functioning
of certain national asylum systems in
2020 impaired people’s ability to
access international protection, thereby
increasing their exposure to protection
risks. Globally, the number of new asylumseekers registered at first instance
dropped by 45% in 2020, from 2 million
to 1 million. This represented the biggest
single year drop in new individual asylum
applications over the last two decades.
Likewise, despite this significant drop in

asylum applications in most countries due
to increased travel restrictions, national
asylum systems continued to see
increased backlogs that will be
challenging to overcome after the
situation normalizes. There are additional
adaptive measures that countries could
be taking to ensure that the asylum
systems are prepared to face these risks
and minimize the time necessary for the
systems to recover.

In 2020, UNHCR continued efforts to
prevent violations and abuses towards
people under UNHCR's mandate moving
in mixed flows, and to provide them with
adequate protection and assistance.
Given the multisectoral response, UNHCR
developed and strengthened inter-agency
engagement, leading or co-leading virtual
Mixed Migration Working Groups and
Task Forces at country and regional levels.
It engaged with the European Union and
African Union, supporting key protection
and solutions objectives under the Khartoum
and Rabat Processes and the guiding
framework of the Joint Valletta Action
Plan. It engaged on the new EU pact on
asylum and migration and advocated,
alongside IOM and via the AU-EU-UN
Task Force on Libya, for the rights of
refugees and migrants in the context of
arbitrary detention and mass expulsions.
It engaged with States and humanitarian
actors to try to save lives by advocating
for strengthened search and rescue in the
Mediterranean and West African Atlantic.

To help prevent deaths on dangerous land
and sea routes, UNHCR further developed
communication with communities (CwC)
at risk via its revised Accountability to
Affected People policy, country and
regional CwC strategies and its flagship
initiative “Telling the Real Story”.
UNHCR advocated for increased access
to third-country solutions for refugees in
mixed movements along the Mediterranean
routes, including evacuations to Emergency
Transit Mechanisms in Niger and Rwanda,
resettlement, and complementary
pathways including family reunification.
UNHCR proposed route-based protection
initiatives to strengthen overall protection
responses, in line with the Central
Mediterranean Risk Mitigation Strategy
and the “Live, Learn and Participate”
child protection initiative in Egypt,
Ethiopia, Libya and Sudan.
As co-chair of the Global Protection
Cluster anti-trafficking team, UNHCR
developed the “Introductory guide to antitrafficking action in internal displacement
contexts”. With IOM, it issued the

UNHCR participated in the UN Network
on Migration, as a member of its Executive
Committee and co-lead of its Working
Group on Alternatives to Detention,
which issued the policy brief “COVID-19
and immigration detention: What can
Governments and other stakeholders
do?” Given their potential impact on
asylum and international protection,
UNHCR also engaged actively with other
workstreams of the UN Migration Network,
in particular with the Working Group on
Return and Reintegration of Migrants,
focusing on objective 21 of the Global
Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular
Migration: “Cooperate in facilitating safe
and dignified return and readmission, as
well as sustainable reintegration”.

Challenges and unmet needs
Dangerous sea movements continued,
with fatal incidents in all regions,
including off the coast of the Bolivarian
Republic of Venezuela, in the Atlantic
and in the Mediterranean and Andaman
Seas. Too many people were compelled
to take precarious sea journeys in
overcrowded and unseaworthy vessels,
falling prey to unscrupulous smugglers,
facing pushbacks at sea and denied
disembarkation in a place of safety.
Strengthening search and rescue capacity
is fundamental and necessary to save
lives at sea, although not sufficient to
prevent recurring tragedies. Predictable
disembarkation in line with international
standards is needed to ensure that
survivors are promptly delivered to a place
of safety. Strengthened international
cooperation and responsibility- and
burden-sharing are also needed to ensure
access to protection, assistance and other
solutions for rescued survivors, in line
with international law and standards.

643 persons in need

length of stay: 155 days.

Operational highlights
In Libya, UNHCR and IOM advocated
against mass expulsions of mixed groups
of third-country nationals without due
process and in unsafe and undignified
conditions. UNHCR’s advocacy for
alternatives to detention led to the release
of 400 refugees and asylum-seekers.
Under the Central Mediterranean Family

Results and achievements
Despite the challenges posed by the
COVID-19 pandemic, notable progress
was made in raising awareness of the
plight of stateless persons and in
achieving concrete results to prevent and
resolve statelessness. Pledges submitted
at the 2019 High-Level Segment on
Statelessness and Global Refugee Forum
helped accelerate these efforts. Of the
270 pledges to address statelessness
submitted by States at the High-Level
Segment and the Forum, more than
30 pledges were either fully or partially
implemented by the end of 2020.
With technical support from UNHCR,
19 countries reformed their nationality
laws, policies and procedures to close
gaps leading to statelessness during
the year. Particularly important were
legislative changes introducing legal
safeguards to prevent statelessness.
Albania, for instance, adopted a new
nationality law which includes an
unrestricted safeguard to grant nationality
to stateless children born in its territory,
if they would otherwise be stateless.

182 U N H C R G LO B A L R E P O R T 2 02 0

A large number of States with significant
populations of persons at risk of
statelessness removed barriers to birth
registration. In Turkmenistan, a new civil
registration law entered into force which
guarantees birth registration to all
children born in the country. The Republic
of the Congo removed fees associated
with birth registration and established
auxiliary civil status centres in health
facilities. A number of States also made
arrangements to mitigate the impact of
the pandemic on birth registration rates.
In March, the Government of Jordan
suspended deadlines for birth
registration and waived fees for late
birth registration. In an effort to identify
and protect stateless persons, Côte
d’Ivoire, Kazakhstan and Ukraine
established statelessness determination
procedures.
In 2020, UNHCR strengthened its existing
partnerships to address statelessness.
UNHCR and UNICEF continued their joint
efforts as part of the Coalition on Every
Child’s Right to a Nationality and

Operational highlights
Notable progress was made in the area
of resolving protracted situations of
statelessness. In December, following
extensive advocacy efforts by UNHCR,
the President of Kenya announced a
landmark decision to grant citizenship to
1,670 stateless Shona and 1,300 stateless
persons of Rwandan descent.
In Central Asia, UNHCR continued its
statelessness identification and reduction
programme in Kazakhstan, Tajikistan and
Turkmenistan, where UNHCR’s legal
partners conducted outreach activities
and provided legal counselling to
identified persons to acquire nationality
or have it confirmed. As a result of joint
efforts by the Governments, UNHCR
and civil society, over 34,600 stateless
persons acquired nationality in 2020,
including some 28,400 in Uzbekistan,
4,200 in Tajikistan and 2,000 in
Kazakhstan.

Despite these positive developments, the
COVID-19 pandemic caused a setback in
statelessness prevention efforts and had a
disproportionate impact on stateless
populations. Many stateless persons were
barred from accessing testing and
treatment due to lack of legal status, were
excluded from social services, and faced
significant socioeconomic impacts as a
result of the crisis. In May 2020, UNHCR
issued guidance on policy and good
practice to help protect stateless people
and ensure their access to services.
2020 saw a lower number of States
acceding to the UN Statelessness
Conventions than anticipated, however
2021 marks the 60 th anniversary of the
adoption of the 1961 Convention on the
Reduction of Statelessness and advocacy
efforts to commemorate the anniversary
are expected to accelerate the number of
accessions.
The lack of reliable data on statelessness
also continued to be a challenge. Current
statistics cover only 94 countries with
a total number of 4.2 million stateless
persons reported. A number of initiatives
are underway to tackle this problem,
including the joint development of
International Recommendations on
Statelessness Statistics by UNHCR,
the Expert Group on Refugees and
Internally Displaced Persons Statistics,
and UNFPA. The recommendations are
likely to be adopted in 2023.

Results and achievements
Communities are often the first responders
in situations that humanitarian actors have
difficulties reaching, a fact made all the more
evident with the onset of the COVID-19
pandemic. Country operations where
UNHCR and partners had invested time and
resources in forging strong protection
partnerships with communities prior to the
pandemic were able to adapt to new realities
faster, with people of concern experiencing
fewer interruptions in access to, and delivery
of, protection and other key services, often
managed by refugees themselves.
Examples of refugee frontline responders
in 2020 were numerous: in Duhok, Iraq,
community members were trained remotely
in psychological first aid in response to the
growing mental health needs produced by
the COVID-19 pandemic. In Nepal, UNHCR
increased the number of female community
workers to ensure a safe and trusted channel
for gender-based violence case referral
and to provide confidential 24/7 access to
UNHCR’s protection hotline. IDPs in Ukraine
were also actively involved in the COVID-19
response, including by taking part in
coordinating committees led by local
authorities, running counselling hotlines, and
conducting psychological support and art
therapy classes for adolescents. In Lebanon,
more than 450 refugees with a medical
background were mobilized as community
health volunteers, focusing on COVID-19
awareness, hygiene promotion, surveillance
and initial advice. To strengthen its support of
community structures and frontline refugee
responders, UNHCR offered guidance
on partnership modalities and followed up on
pledges made at the Global Refugee Forum
in relation to meaningful participation.
UNHCR continued to equip staff with relevant
knowledge, skills and practical resources.
Since its launch in September 2019, the
community-based protection online course
benefitted over 1,200 staff. To support

184 U N H C R G LO B A L R E P O R T 2 02 0

regionalization, UNHCR invested in building
regional capacity to design and deliver
training to community-based protection
officers. In the East and Horn of Africa and
the Great Lakes region, a tailored learning
programme focusing on community-based
protection in the context of COVID-19 was
rolled out. UNHCR’s global online community
of practice was revamped and re-launched
in 2020, with specific guidance and tools to
address challenges related to COVID-19,
facilitate peer learning, and identify and
document promising practices in the
context of COVID-19.
Participatory approaches remained a critical
component of UNHCR’s age, gender and
diversity (AGD) and community-based
protection approaches; however COVID-19
physical distancing guidance limited
humanitarian access and forced country
operations to adapt their participatory
methodologies. Successful examples
emerged from a number of operations where
digital solutions, working through refugee
facilitators and diversifying participatory
approaches for data collection proved
successful. Globally, despite the challenges
related to COVID-19, 289 UNHCR-led
participatory assessments, inclusive of all
people of concern, were reported across
operations in 2020, compared to 510 in 2019.

Operational highlights
As part of the larger community structures
that UNHCR invested in setting up in
Doro refugee camp in South Sudan,
representatives from the camp’s youth
committee ensured that key information on
COVID-19, including good hygiene practices,
was communicated and disseminated in each
of the eight local dialects. Youth committee
members composed eight songs on
COVID-19 in their local languages and visited
one village after another, sensitizing refugee
community members to the risks of
COVID-19, and singing the translated version
of the songs according to the dialect spoken

in each specific location. In total, the youth
committee reached 4,899 community
members (2,092 male and 2,807 female).
In Bangladesh, in the settlements of
Cox’s Bazar, UNHCR’s community group
programme was expanded to 30 settlements
with 150 community groups, comprising
over 3,490 volunteers, including 35 female
youth groups with 630 active members,
disseminating accurate information on
COVID-19 prevention. These groups
collectively identified and prioritized the
needs of their communities, and in response,
designed and implemented close to
5,860 service projects, focusing on raising
awareness on COVID-19, protection risks,
improving infrastructure, disaster risk
reduction, and promoting meaningful
participation. UNHCR also trained these
community volunteers on various issues,
including disability inclusion, conflict
resolution, community engagement, gender
equality, leadership and interpersonal
communication. In total, this network
conducted 82,635 outreach sessions,
reaching 439,200 refugees, covering health,
hygiene, COVID-19 prevention and response,

emergency preparedness, and a range of
general protection issues.

Challenges and unmet needs
Effective community-based protection
requires proximity, regular interactions with
communities, time, resources and constant
innovation to adapt to rapidly changing
contexts. COVID-19 restrictions resulted in
limited humanitarian access to affected
communities while scarce resources were
shifted to address other priorities resulting
from interruptions in community-based and
gender equality interventions, as well as
peaceful-coexistence programming.
Social distancing hindered the ability of
communities to come together to discuss
their needs and work jointly to address
them. Where such limitations prevailed,
UNHCR invested in innovative outreach
and communication, including with those
it had limited or no direct contact with.
However, additional investments in
community-based protection are needed
to better support community-based and
refugee-led organizations who are standing
up in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

assessments reported globally

SPOTLIGHT: Strengthening peaceful coexistence between communities
The COVID-19 pandemic imposed a strain on national services and severely impacted socioeconomic
conditions for host and displaced communities alike. This resulted in increased tensions among
displaced and host communities, particularly in areas where resources and livelihoods where already scarce.
On the other hand, the pandemic also prompted the emergence of many community-based initiatives in support
of those most impacted by the pandemic from both communities. In an effort to support these peaceful
coexistence initiatives, UNHCR worked closely with States, local authorities, and community structures to mitigate
the impact of COVID-19 through a community-based approach. UNHCR supported communities in identifying
issues that were the source of conflict and tension, and implementing social, cultural and livelihoods programming
for displaced and host communities alike.
UNHCR also invested in national infrastructure and services for both host and displaced communities. In Nigeria,
UNHCR supported the construction and renovation of disease control and primary health facilities, medical staff
accommodation quarters, and COVID-19 testing and isolation centres. These projects benefited both the Cameroonian
refugees and the local communities hosting them in urban areas and settlements as well as rural areas.
In Tanganyika in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, in response to increasing tension linked to competition
over basic social services and resources, UNHCR organized 583 awareness-raising sessions on peace and
peaceful coexistence. Activities were carried out through 380 focus groups, 36 open sessions, 34 participatory
theatre sessions and 133 door-to-door campaigns. In total, 24,372 individuals were reached through face-to-face
sessions and messages on peace and peaceful cohabitation were recorded in the form of spots (1,432) and
broadcasted on partner community radio stations in the territories of Kalemie, Manono, Moba, Nynzu and Pweto,
reaching an estimated population of around 738,803 listeners.

Results and achievements
Open and transparent two-way
communication and access to information
are key to ensuring the participation
of people of concern and UNHCR’s
accountability to affected people; this
was never more apparent than in the
face of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Despite movement restrictions and limited
access to affected communities, UNHCR
had to ensure that consistent, trusted and
accessible information on the pandemic
was made available to people of concern.
It also had to ensure continued access
to trusted feedback and complaint
mechanisms so that programmes and
interventions could be adapted to ensure
everyone, regardless of their age, gender,
disability, race, religion, sexual orientation
and/or gender identity, could safely
access services and opportunities on
an equal footing.
To help operations ensure accountability
to affected people, UNHCR produced

186 U N H C R G LO B A L R E P O R T 2 02 0

guidance on risk communication and
community engagement at the onset of
the pandemic; guidance on how to
establish WhatsApp and other instant
messaging trees; the accountability to

media in community-based protection.
UNHCR continued to co-chair the IASC
Results Group 2 on Accountability and
Inclusion to support coordination and
collaboration on AAP in humanitarian
responses and co-chaired a sub-group in
the Global Collective Service for Risk
Communication and Community
Engagement focused on refugees,
migrants and IDPs. As a result of this
engagement, inter-agency guidance was
produced and UNHCR organized four
global webinars to disseminate best
practice on risk communication and
community engagement. In addition,
UNHCR engaged with community-led
organizations and partners to maintain

A number of country offices for instance
turned to messaging apps to keep
refugee communication channels open
during times of physical distancing. These
provided critical life-saving information,
linked people of concern to online
services, and created spaces for feedback
and referral to other service providers.
UNHCR worked across operations to
build on existing initiatives and trial a
more systematic and scalable approach
for engaging communities on WhatsApp
through a pilot project covering four
countries, beginning in Ecuador.
In Ecuador, UNHCR launched the first of
these WhatsApp pilot projects, using a
communication channel trusted by many
in the community. The pilot allowed
people of concern to access information
on COVID-19 and enabled them to share
information with UNHCR and partners,
such as reporting incidents of violence or
abuse. UNHCR ensured a human-centred
design approach, engaging with
communities to test features and
functionalities as the pilot moved forward.
In Ecuador, during the initial three-month
trial phase, over 200,000 messages were
sent between UNHCR, partners and
around 12,000 users.
UNHCR proactively sought ways to keep
two-way communication channels open
despite lockdowns and physical
distancing requirements. In Jordan,
Morocco, and South Africa, it conducted
online focus group discussions to listen
to the needs and priorities of people of

concern and provide feedback on
adaptive arrangements. In Kenya, the
UNHCR-supported call centre become
a trusted source of information about
the COVID-19 pandemic. In Lebanon,
WhatsApp communication trees allowed
information to be provided and shared
between UNHCR and people of concern.

Challenges and unmet needs
While face-to-face communication and
traditional channels like radio remain
important, people of concern’s
preferences are diversifying to include
increased use of multi-channel contact
centres, digital platforms and social media
channels. The pandemic amplified this
trend and UNHCR’s response has shone
a bright light on the Office’s innovative
work to ensure that UNHCR remains
accountable to people of concern. It has
also highlighted challenging areas in
UNHCR’s response.
For instance, despite the adoption of
new communication channels to share
information and/or to receive and provide
feedback, UNHCR needed to ensure
that opportunities were securely,
systematically and sustainably leveraged,
without deprioritizing traditional
face-to-face channels. For example,
the increasing adoption of social media
as a communication channel was not
without its challenges: the variety and
velocity of information being shared,
and the expectations for an “immediate
response”, strained existing operational
resources at all levels and exposed policy
and expertise gaps.

refugees and IDPs accessed
protection services, including
gender-based violence and
child protection services.

Results and achievements
Children make up 31% of the world
population but 40% of IDPs and 50% of
refugees. COVID-19 restricted education
and youth opportunities while increasing
poverty, isolation and violence against
children. The most common child
protection issues in 2020 were related to
unaccompanied and separated children,
lack or loss of birth certificates, abuse or
violence outside home or school, child
labour, child marriage, access to birth
registration, and non-child-friendly asylum
procedures. UNHCR focused on
strengthening access to child protection
systems, providing best interests and
child-friendly refugee procedures,
supporting families and communities,
and providing opportunities for youth
engagement and empowerment.
Progress was made on the inclusion of
refugees in national child protection
systems in Greece, Mexico and elsewhere.
A UNHCR-UNICEF “Blueprint for joint
action: A fair deal for refugee children”
elaborated a holistic strategy to ensure
no child was left behind. 11 operations
developed plans for including refugee
children in national child protection

188 U N H C R G LO B A L R E P O R T 2 02 0

systems, scaling up best interests procedures,
registering births, and strengthening
community-based protection, mental health
and psychosocial support.
Despite UNHCR’s work to improve access
to and quality of child-friendly procedures,
there were 18% fewer best interests
assessments in 2020 but more children
at risk, unaccompanied or separated,
and COVID-19 restrictions made it harder
to identify and help them. Many operations
introduced remote case management,
pressed for child protection case managers
and social services to be considered
essential staff, and worked with community
outreach workers, volunteers and health
professionals to strengthen identification
and referral. Community-based child
protection mechanisms such as youth
clubs, child protection committees and
adolescent and children’s groups grew to
97, from 87 in 2019, with many moving
online. Challenges included insufficient
qualified child protection staff, limited
access to basic services, and limited
access to community-based programmes.
A new regional approach, “Raising UNHCR
capacities for youth”, focused on
strengthening youth programming and

UNHCR strengthened information
management and data analysis for child
protection, publishing child protection
funding analysis in the inter-agency
“Still unprotected” report. UNHCR’s child
protection module in proGres v4 was
used in 61 settings for over 8,000 children
at risk.

Operational highlights
In India, UNHCR’s child-friendly COVID-19
information guided parents and helped
manage children’s anxiety. UNHCR and
partners scaled up a child helpline and
referral to remote best interests
procedures. Over 9,000 parents,
caregivers and children benefited from
communication material and online
dialogue on child protection issues,
including e-safety and online abuse.
In Ethiopia, UNHCR increased staffing
and enhanced case management and
scaled up family-like care arrangements
for unaccompanied and separated
children. Before the pandemic, UNHCR
and partners had identified additional
foster families and increased the child
protection workforce to bolster quality
case management. Incentives paid to
foster families, unchanged in five years,
rose after a market assessment.
Only 300 unaccompanied or separated
children remained in community care
when armed conflict broke out in
November, a reduction of over 85% within
a year and the fewest since community
care began in 2010. UNHCR prioritized
cash assistance for unaccompanied and
separated children in family-based care

and shelter repairs for those in community
care centres. Most importantly, it
enhanced the capacity of guardians and
receiving families, crucial when the
conflict blocked humanitarian assistance.

Challenges and unmet needs
A multi-year analysis found the most
frequent child protection challenges were
government policies and/or capacities,
funding, partner capacity, awareness
among people of concern about child
protection issues and services, and
UNHCR staff capacity. Systematic
underfunding of child protection, which
is on average 47% funded compared to
67% for global humanitarian appeals,
worsened in the pandemic. A survey of
over 100 UNHCR and partner staff
working on inter-agency child protection
mechanisms picked funding as the top
challenge in refugee settings, followed
by shortages of child protection actors
and technical capacity, low visibility of
the child protection response, limited
capacity to scale up and absorb funding,
and lack of humanitarian access.
No youth-disaggregated data exists
across humanitarian agencies, including
UNHCR. Nor is there a system to
systematically track progress and ensure
accountability for the implementation
of the “Core actions for refugee youth”.

48 situations reporting on

UNHCR’s global strategic
priority indicator for female
participation had either
improved or maintained the
percentage of female
participants in leadership and
management structures.
2019 result: 56.

Results and achievements
UNHCR is committed to the equal and
meaningful participation of women and
girls in decision-making processes,
community management and leadership
structures, in both emergency and
protracted displacement situations. In the
context of lockdowns and social distancing,
collaboration with community-based
women’s organizations was reinforced to
support remote service delivery, while
promoting women’s leadership. UNHCR
developed guidelines for outreach
volunteers to continue awareness-raising
activities with telecommunication and
social media platforms. In Pakistan,
UNHCR collaborated with female
outreach volunteers, community
mobilizers and gender support groups to
enhance access to information on
COVID-19 preventive measures, including
addressing social stigma and providing
psychosocial support.
Women and women-led organizations
played a crucial role in the mitigation of
the COVID-19 crisis. UNHCR strengthened
community-based self-management
structures and empowered women with

190 U N H C R G LO B A L R E P O R T 2 02 0

leadership skills to actively participate
in decision-making. Empowered
women and girls’ committees fostered
participation and actively searched for
solutions to reduce gender discrimination.
Key messages on gender equality were
amplified through mobile networks while
community-based complaints mechanisms
to report sexual exploitation and abuse
were strengthened through peer
counselling. In the Central African
Republic, a radio communication strategy
was developed with women returnee
community leaders to conduct
sensitization on COVID-19, gender-based
violence risks and services, and gender
equality.
In Chad, India, Nigeria and Uganda,
UNHCR and partners focused on women
and girls’ self-determination and the
full exercise of their rights to ensure
equal and meaningful participation in
decision-making processes. Stronger
participation of women and girls in
leadership and management structures
was achieved in IDP operations in
Burkina Faso, the Central African Republic,
Myanmar, South Sudan and Yemen.

UNHCR also continued to promote
and advocate for gender equality in
humanitarian action by building on
initiatives such as gender audits of global
processes around the Global Refugee
Forum and the Global Compact on
Refugees, becoming a board member
of the Compact on Women, Peace and
Security and Humanitarian Action. A core
action outcome of the “2020 UNHCR
Policy on the prevention of, risk
mitigation, and response to gender-based
violence” is preventing gender-based
violence by addressing gender inequality,
discrimination and unequal power
relations.

Operational highlights
The highest percentage of women’s
participation in community leadership
structures was achieved in the operations
in Cameroon (49%), Rwanda (50.9%) and
the United Republic of Tanzania (49.3%).
In Cameroon, women were trained by
UNHCR and partners in prevention and
response to gender-based violence, child
protection and services for persons at
heightened risk. In Rwanda, women
refugee leaders strengthened their
advocacy skills and created a forum to
bolster their leadership within camp
management structures. In the United
Republic of Tanzania, elections were
organized for vacant positions in three
camps shortly after COVID-19 restrictions

were lifted, with UNHCR and partners
successfully mobilizing women, including
those at heightened risk, to stand
for election.
In Chad, UNHCR and partners engaged
in emergency protection services during
lockdowns. The closure of schools,
workplaces and safe spaces for women
and girls increased the risk of protection
incidents, particularly against women and
girls and young children. Ensuring equal
or greater representation of female
members in committees and focal points
was crucial to support protection cases
with referrals to relevant resources and
protection services.

Challenges and unmet needs
Gender inequalities were exacerbated
by COVID-19. Structural violence and
discrimination based on gender put
women’s participation in decision-making
and leadership bodies at risk. Refugee
communities in Kenya and Indonesia
could not achieve leadership gender
parity because movement restrictions
delayed representative elections.
Elsewhere, the number of women
participating decreased, dropping
from 45% to 37% in Zambia. This reflects
an established and known tendency:
in the face of an emergency, women’s
participation in leadership structures
tends to decrease.
Equal access to decision-making
entities does not guarantee meaningful
participation for disadvantaged groups.
Operations reported a lower level of
participation for women with a disability
and for indigenous women. UNHCR will
invest in paying more attention to
overlapping vulnerabilities and ensuring
an intersectional approach to its work
with women and girls. Complementary
measures such as positive masculinityrelated initiatives for boys and men are
also necessary to rebalance power
relationships.

An estimated 12 million persons with
disabilities and 3.2 million older persons
were among those forcibly displaced by
persecution, violence and human rights
violations.
Despite the challenges of identifying
persons with disabilities and older
persons, made worse by the COVID-19
pandemic, UNHCR’s operations provided
targeted services for at least
55,672 adults with disabilities,
7,948 children with disabilities and
19,739 older persons. 3,749 households
with adults and children with disabilities
and 885 households with older persons
received targeted cash assistance,
COVID-19 prevention items, food
packages, medication and disabilityrelated items (including solar lotion for
persons with albinism). UNHCR organized
over 11,000 targeted home visits and
almost 10,000 rehabilitation sessions
respecting COVID-19 protective
measures. Tele-counselling sessions were
held to ensure continuity of services for

192 U N H C R G LO B A L R E P O R T 2 02 0

households with persons with disabilities,
including protection, rehabilitation, access
to assistive devices, and home-based
education. In addition, at least
3,474 children with disabilities were
helped to access education through
financial support, adapted learning
podcasts, WhatsApp channels, and
home-based education.
In Zimbabwe, for instance, four female
and three male pre-school refugee
learners with a hearing impairment
began sign language lessons. Women
with disabilities received accessible
information on gender-based violence
prevention and response in the
Americas, Kenya and Zimbabwe and
training in business management and
entrepreneurship in Djibouti. Over
1,100 shelter and water, hygiene and
sanitation facilities were upgraded in
Brazil, Ethiopia, Iraq, Jordan, Sudan and
Zimbabwe to ensure accessibility for
persons with disabilities. Following
advocacy efforts from UNHCR, Cameroon
and Tunisia provided disability cards to
refugees and asylum-seekers,

In support of this continued operational
disability inclusion work, UNHCR
developed a baseline report on the
UN Disability Inclusion Strategy
accountability framework and a
cross-divisional five-year action plan on
disability inclusion to advance the rights
of persons with disabilities across its
workforce and operations. The action
plan will be implemented in collaboration
with the International Disability Alliance
(IDA), a global network of organizations of
persons with disabilities, through a new
partnership developed in 2020. Three
regional consultations were organized
to ensure the active engagement of
IDA’s regional and board members
and additional consultations and joint
collaborations with organizations of
persons with disabilities took place in
Ecuador, Ethiopia, Mexico and Spain.
UNHCR also updated its guidance on
working with older persons in forced
displacement and developed guidance
to enhance identification and registration
of persons with disabilities and other
data collection initiatives.

Operational highlights
Persons with disabilities and their
representative organizations were
actively engaged in the development of
accessible materials and awareness
sessions on COVID-19 and gender-based
violence prevention and response, using
visual storytelling, photos, banners and
radio announcements and producing
accessible videos in sign language.

Non-Governmental Organizations of
Persons with Disabilities and their
Families (RIADIS) conducted a regional
assessment on the situation of refugees
and asylum-seekers with disabilities in
the Americas.
In Ethiopia, UNHCR supported three
organizations of persons with disabilities
in Aw-barre, Shedder and Kebribeyah
camps to conduct sensitization sessions
on COVID-19 prevention and response
and engage in income-generating
activities.

Challenges and unmet needs
Beyond the disproportionally deadly
effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on older
persons and persons with disabilities,
related job losses, school dropouts and
rising poverty rates also had a greater
impact. The disruption or closure of key
services such as medical support for
chronic conditions, rehabilitation services
and access to assistive devices limited
their autonomy and impacted their
wellbeing. School closures and the
increasing use of the digital space to
access education and job opportunities,
as well as basic information and services,
increased the risk of exclusion of persons
with disabilities and older persons living
in refugee settings as evidenced by
previous research conducted by UNHCR
and partners. To respond to this reality,
UNHCR launched a call for proposals to
strengthen digital inclusion of refugees
with disabilities as of 2021.

In Ecuador, UNHCR adapted its
information materials and communication
channels to ensure accessibility for
persons with disabilities, developing
printed materials in braille as well easy
to read leaflets. Furthermore, UNHCR

Trainers learning programme
“Working with LGBTIQ+
persons in forced displacement”.
2019 result: 50.

LGBTIQ+ persons continued to experience
discrimination and abuse on a daily basis
in 2020. This discrimination—often
exacerbated by displacement and by
age, gender, disability, race and other
characteristics that intersect with sexual
orientation and gender identity—was
aggravated by the pandemic, with
LGBTIQ+ persons often lacking access to
information and basic support services.
The psychological impact of isolation and
the socioeconomic consequences of
COVID-19 added to the already difficult
reality for forcibly displaced LGBTIQ+
persons.
In response, UNHCR collaborated with
LGBTIQ+ led organizations to reach out
to LGBTIQ+ displaced persons and ensure
their access to accurate information and
feedback mechanisms. In Bangladesh,
UNHCR partnered with organizations
trusted by LGBTIQ+ communities to help
LGBTIQ+ people living in Cox’s Bazar
safely access protection and health
services. In Turkey, UNHCR partners

194 U N H C R G LO B A L R E P O R T 2 02 0

regularly reach out to LGBTIQ+ refugees
and asylum-seekers, providing legal
advice on their asylum applications,
extend psychosocial support networks
and conduct confidential referrals to
vetted landlords, health care providers
and targeted financial support
mechanisms. Counsellors are also made
available through phones, e-mail and
SMS, ensuring regular access to accurate
information and ways to raise concerns
and obtain feedback.
To support meaningful inclusion of
LGBTIQ+ displaced people in national
systems, UNHCR engaged in coordination
and advocacy with various stakeholders.
In Europe, UNHCR worked with the
European Asylum Support Office (EASO)
to raise awareness on challenges facing
LGBTIQ+ persons seeking asylum in
Europe. In West and Central Africa,
UNHCR and OHCHR worked with the
African Union and the Economic
Community of West African States to
ensure the needs of LGBTIQ+ people of
concern were included in the COVID-19
response.

UNHCR organized a Training of Trainers
and developed an online course on
working with LGBTIQ+ persons in forced
displacement. In Côte d’Ivoire, UNHCR
trained authorities on working with
asylum claims linked to sexual orientation
and gender identity.
UNHCR also organized three regional and
global consultations to map protection
stakeholders, analyze gaps and identify
promising practices. These consultations
brought together stakeholders from the
humanitarian and development sectors,
civil society and LGBTIQ+ led organizations.
The results will inform a global roundtable
event on “Protection and solutions for
LGBTIQ+ persons in forced displacement”,
to be co-convened with OHCHR in the
second half of 2021.

Operational highlights
In the Americas, UNHCR supported
national and local NGOs to establish a
regional network for the protection of
LGBTIQ+ refugees, asylum-seekers and
IDPs. Across the region, 152 support spaces
offered by more than 17 organizations were
set up along routes out of the Bolivarian
Republic of Venezuela and into Brazil,
Chile, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru. In
these support spaces, LGBTIQ+ persons
received information, orientation, wireless
connectivity, psychological first aid,
health assistance, safe access to water,
sanitation and hygiene services, and
found safe spaces for women and children.

community centre for LGBTIQ+ persons
at risk, reached over 1,735 people with
UNHCR financial and technical support.
Together with Organización Diálogo
Diverso, an organization supporting
LGBTIQ+ rights, and in coordination with
the local government, UNHCR strengthened
institutional capacity to work with
LGBTIQ+ people and to provide
psychosocial assistance to LGBTIQ+
persons at risk.

Challenges and unmet needs
Despite significant progress, LGBTIQ+
persons of concern face violence and
discrimination in many parts of the world
and remain a largely under-identified
population, with few targeted programmes
and interventions. The pandemic
exacerbated their protection needs and
limited the ability of humanitarian actors
to identify and refer them to existing
services. UNHCR continued to invest in
partnerships with LGBTIQ+ supported
organizations and collaborated with
them to establish safe and effective
referral pathways; however building
such partnerships with national and
international actors requires further
investment. Building the capacity of
UNHCR staff, partners, service providers
and asylum adjudicators in this area also
requires significant investment. While
identified LGBTIQ+ refugees most at risk
are prioritized for refugee status
determination and resettlement, shrinking
resettlement opportunities means more
effort must be dedicated to identifying
alternatives, including complementary
pathways and carefully crafted integration
strategies. Lack of sustainable livelihoods
for LGBTIQ+ people remains an obstacle.

In Ecuador, UNHCR supported LGBTIQ+
organizations and community groups.

In 2020, the pandemic exacerbated
existing humanitarian challenges. More
than 85% of refugees were hosted in
low- and middle-income countries.
COVID-19 preparedness and response
dominated UNHCR’s activities. The High
Commissioner declared a global Level 2
Emergency, activating emergency
procedures and providing more flexibility to
country teams on procurement, partnership
and staffing issues. The Inter-Agency
Standing Committee adopted system-wide
scale-up protocols. UNHCR faced multiple
challenges: refugees and IDPs, in both
camp and urban settings, often have
inadequate housing, crowded living
conditions, lack of access to clean water,
and weak health infrastructure. COVID-19
increased their vulnerability as many lost
jobs, adding to health and protection risks,
including gender-based violence.

UNHCR built up the capacity of government
and partner staff to conduct surveillance,
contact tracing and case management, and
provided personal protective equipment
(PPE), medicines, oxygen, rapid testing kits
and other supplies. It procured $186.1 million
worth of PPE, critical items and services to
help its operations fight COVID-19. UNHCR
repaired, upgraded and extended shelters to
reduce population density, providing almost
1.8 million people with emergency shelters
and 500,000 with transitional shelters.
UNHCR developed context-specific
guidance to support national responses,
particularly with setting up emergency
hospitals, quarantine, isolation and testing
areas, and expansion of medical facilities to
create additional space for triage and
testing. It provided over 100 health care
facilities and 95 schools with additional
WASH facilities, distributing 50 million
bars of soap, as well as hand sanitizer and
disinfectant, to over 60 UNHCR operations.
Thousands of handwashing facilities were
installed in public spaces, schools, health
care facilities and private accommodation.
UNHCR scaled up cash assistance,
distributing nearly $700 million to 8.5 million
people to mitigate the pandemic’s impact.

Despite unprecedented global restrictions
on travel and transportation of goods and
additional staff safety and health risks,
UNHCR continued to respond to major
displacement emergencies such as those
in Côte d’Ivoire, Ethiopia, Mozambique,
Nagorno-Karabakh and the Sahel.
Its timely, field-oriented support included
over 300 emergency deployments of
UNHCR and partner staff and shipment of
more than $36 million worth of core relief
items and other critical goods from global
stockpiles. UNHCR continued systematic
efforts to prepare for conflict-induced
emergencies in a complex, multi-hazard
environment, ensuring operational capacity
to assist and protect people in need, while
taking into account access constraints,
climate risks, security considerations and
impact of the pandemic. These activities
were closely coordinated with other
UN agencies and NGOs via Inter-Agency
Standing Committee mechanisms such as
the Emergency Directors’ Group.
This chapter outlines UNHCR’s emergency
preparedness and response in 2020 and
its principled, comprehensive and prompt
life-saving interventions. It details the key
achievements, operational highlights and
major challenges in meeting the most
urgent humanitarian and protection needs
of refugees and IDPs, as well as those of
the communities hosting them.

Safety and security

During 2020, UNHCR activated 10 new
emergency situations at L3, L2 and L1
level, affecting 26 countries. In addition,
the Office declared a L2 global
emergency for the COVID-19 pandemic.

UNHCR’s security workforce, made up
of 88 international and more than
250 national security professionals,
played an important role in UNHCR’s
ability to deliver in high-risk duty stations.
Security missions were undertaken in
several countries including Ethiopia,
Mozambique and the Sahel region.
Maintaining a robust training programme
remained key to field security work.
In 2020, over 3,000 UNHCR and
almost 500 partner staff were trained
on security-related topics, including
the Security Management Learning
Programme and Women’s Security
Awareness Training. UNHCR’s security
workforce responded to 298 security
incidents and supported managers and
staff on 13 critical incidents in 2020,
coordinating with the UN Department
of Safety and Security in New York
and government personnel.

The COVID-19 pandemic significantly
impeded UNHCR’s ability to deploy staff
to new emergencies. However, the pace
of emergency deployments increased in
the second half of the year, when staff
movements were hampered by premission COVID-19 testing, quarantine
requirements and reduced air transport.
Some deployments started remotely until
travel was possible, and standby partners
were asked to identify in-country
international experts. Overall, UNHCR
facilitated 319 deployments, including
150 UNHCR staff and 169 external staff
working for emergency standby partners.
Face-to-face training in emergency
preparedness and response was
cancelled and swiftly converted into
online learning, and 90 UNHCR and
31 partner staff were trained. UNHCR
developed an online alternative for
emergency simulation exercises for the
2021 emergency roster cohort.

Operational highlights
In 2020, despite COVID-19, the
eight-person full-time emergency response
team spent 738 person-days on
emergency missions in the field, leading

complex emergency responses and
supporting UNHCR operations.
In response to the L2 emergency in
Sudan, an emergency response team
(including WASH, registration, shelter
and site planning specialists) arrived in
eastern Chad to support UNHCR staff
with reception of refugees in border
areas. As a result, 7,000 refugees were
relocated to a newly built camp where
they received assistance, health services
and protection. UNHCR instituted
COVID-19 prevention and response
measures at border areas and in the
camp. Clear messages were shared
with local authorities and communities
about key principles of refugee
protection, such as non-refoulement
and non-discrimination.
In Somalia, UNHCR security specialists
supported an extensive project that
fulfilled a duty-of-care obligation to
protect UNHCR staff and others: the
development of a new office and
accommodation site for UNHCR’s Somalia
operation, which was operating from
a cramped compound that had been
targeted by mortar fire. As well as
risk analysis, UNHCR staff played an
important role in identifying a site,
designing the compound layout,

developing a security-compliant
construction system, and overseeing
delivery of building materials and
construction work.
UNHCR strove to improve the gender
balance of its security staff. Prior to 2020,
18 female security officers (national and
international), represented only 8% of
UNHCR’s security workforce, and
initiatives are underway to redress that
imbalance. The recruitment of four female
security officers in 2020 increased the
total to 22, or 12%, with a long way to go.

Challenges and unmet needs
As well as bringing disruption, the
pandemic quickened efforts to transfer
knowledge to new regional structures on
emergency preparedness, emergency
partnerships, procurement and logistics
and security management. COVID-19
brought upheaval to travel plans and
training but spurred innovation, and rapid
development of online alternatives kept
training activities as interactive as
possible. But some activities, such as
women’s security awareness training,
needed face-to-face interaction and were
largely put on hold, and some planned
missions to conduct oversight and
compliance reviews were also cancelled.

Global supply management

UNHCR prioritized the practice of
secondary bidding for high-value orders
and shipment of CRIs procured through
global frame agreements. Secondary
bidding is a solicitation exercise whereby
suppliers holding already established
frame agreements with set prices are
invited to further bid their best and final
offers for the required goods and
services. This approach results in
significantly lower prices, thereby freeing
resources to serve more people in need.
As a result, in 2020 secondary bidding
cut the cost of centrally procured CRIs by
16% ($18 million) compared to the lowest
frame agreement price.

Despite the pressures of COVID-19,
UNHCR’s supply chain did not stop
responding to new and ongoing
emergencies, dispatching $36.2 million
worth of emergency core relief items
(CRIs) from its strategically located global
stockpiles (GSM), serving 139 requests.
1,000 tons of CRIs were shipped by air,
2,100 tons by sea and 4,800 tons by road.
UNHCR carried out 22 airlifts (11 from
GSMs) for recipients in Bangladesh,
Burkina Faso, Chad, the Islamic Republic
of Iran, Liberia, Somalia and Sudan.
Global stocks were regularly replenished
to cover the urgent needs of up to
600,000 people within 72 hours. UNHCR
added an eighth global stockpile in
Panama to its existing seven, to enhance
emergency response in the Americas.
To maximize the potential of the supply
chain, UNHCR proactively engaged
with sister agencies and partners,
collaborating through the Logistics
Cluster, the UN Procurement Network
and the UN Global Marketplace. UNHCR
increased piggybacking—using long-term
agreements established by other
UN organizations—by more than 20%
compared to 2019, resulting in increased
efficiency, active collaboration, better
service delivery and cost-effective
tendering. UNHCR also provided contract
administration for over 400 global frame
agreements, while procurement value
increased from $1.14 billion in 2019 to
$1.37 billion in 2020, excluding cash
assistance.

Operational highlights
UNHCR reinforced its operational
capacity with virtual supply missions,
field procurement support and training.
To ensure a broad range of qualified
supply staff, UNHCR conducted more
than 350 functional clearances
(assessments, testing and interview
processes) for supply positions worldwide.
A compliance workshop was organized
to sensitize participants from almost
20 operations to supply-related risks

To enhance the supply chain, UNHCR
started developing a shipment tracking
system, rolled out logistics frame
agreements to field offices, and created
data dashboards to help operations
monitor their supply performance related
to the COVID-19 response. To improve
forecasting, the roll-out for Demantra
(a demand management and supply
chain management tool) was completed;
the tool is used by 56 operations.

Challenges and unmet needs
COVID-19 and its associated challenges,
as well as other new emergencies, further
highlighted the need for sustained
availability of expert supply workforce
as part of global workforce planning,
supported by increased capacity building
and an end-to-end process on supply
chain management.

Results and achievements
2020 marked the culmination of UNHCR’s
five-year “Strategy for the
institutionalization of cash-based
interventions”, which aimed to make
UNHCR’s operations consider cash
systematically and use it as the means
of transfer whenever appropriate,
doubling cash assistance by 2020.

new cash grants and targeting criteria to
assist vulnerable populations, as well as
exit strategies and complaint/feedback
mechanisms.

The strategy has transformed UNHCR’s
use of cash assistance. In 2016, digital
payments to refugees, including access
to bank and or mobile money, were limited
to a few countries. In 2020, refugees in
47 countries got digital payments, 32%
in the form of mobile money.

Financial and digital inclusion is a vital
component of protection and fostering
self-reliance and resilience, but refugees
are often excluded from governments’
social assistance efforts. Cash assistance
complements government support with
a safety net for vulnerable refugees and
others of concern. In the COVID-19
response, UNHCR aligned cash
assistance (mostly transfer values but also
other elements such as eligibility criteria)
with government schemes in several
countries, including Armenia, Azerbaijan,
Costa Rica, Mauritania, Morocco, Pakistan,
Peru, and to some extent in Rwanda and
Uganda. In addition, UNHCR provided
cash for livelihoods in 52 operations to
prevent refugees being forced to sell
productive assets to shore up household
budgets.

The pandemic spurred UNHCR to rapidly
scale up its cash assistance programmes.
In collaboration with governments and
other partners, more than 65 UNHCR
operations launched new cash initiatives
and expanded or adapted existing cash
assistance. They introduced new
approaches and technology and designed

By the end of 2020, 14 operations (Brazil,
Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Costa Rica, the
Democratic Republic of the Congo,
Ethiopia, Ghana, Greece, Guatemala,
Jordan, Kenya, Mexico, Rwanda and
Zambia) were using UNHCR’s CashAssist
cash management system and 60 were
using the post-distribution monitoring

Despite the difficulties of face-to-face
transactions in 2020, UNHCR achieved
this goal and its Grand Bargain
commitment, distributing $695 million
to 8.57 million people, a total of around
$3 billion to more than 25 million people
in over 100 countries since 2016.

Challenges and unmet needs
Despite the growth of cash assistance,
major gaps remained in 2020. In postdistribution monitoring globally, 74% of
respondents said they could meet only
half of their basic needs or less. In Jordan,
64% said they could not afford enough
food, 27% struggled to pay their rent, and
31% could not pay health costs. 60% of
respondents had borrowed money in the
four weeks prior to data collection.
To address some of the main challenges
in attaining system-wide efficiency in cash
assistance, UNHCR will work toward
achieving the UN Common Cash
Statement and build upon progress made
in the seven focus countries: Afghanistan,
Bangladesh, the Central African Republic,
the Democratic Republic of the Congo,

Results and achievements
Faced with COVID-19, UNHCR supported
governments and partners to bolster
surveillance, contact tracing and case
management, providing PPE, medicines,
rapid testing kits and oxygen
concentrators. UNHCR worked with
national health counterparts to strengthen
health infrastructure, supporting intensive
care units, creating isolation and
treatment units as well as ensuring
refugee communities were informed
about how to mitigate the risks. Together
with UN and NGO partners, UNHCR
worked with Ministries of Health to
implement COVID-19 preparedness and
response plans, addressing the health of
people of concern, including nutrition,
sexual and reproductive health, HIV, and
mental health and psychosocial support.
UNHCR supported 9.89 million people
with essential health care, adapting
services with physical distancing, hand
hygiene points, telephone consultations—
especially for mental health and
non-communicable diseases (NCDs), and
provision of several months of NCD/HIV
medicines at once.

Dedicated safe delivery areas for
COVID-19 positive women allowed
emergency care to continue, while 92%
of births were attended by a skilled birth
attendant. In line with the Sustainable
Development Goals’ focus on reducing
maternal and newborn mortality, and
access to modern contraceptive methods,
UNHCR, with support from the Bill and
Melinda Gates Foundation, implemented
high-impact maternal and neonatal
health interventions in 31 health
facilities in Cameroon, Chad and Niger.
The programme supported more than
8,300 mothers and their newborns
in 2020.
Data from iRHIS showed under-5 mortality
averaged 0.19 deaths per 1,000 under-5s
per month across 158 sites in 19 countries,
down from 0.30 in 2019 and within the
standard of 1.5 deaths. Sites in Yemen,
Zambia and the United Republic of
Tanzania reported the highest rates,
at 1.98, 0.55 and 0.39 respectively.
The average crude mortality rate was
0.11 deaths per 1,000 total population
per month, similar to the 0.12 reported
in 2019.

By the end of 2020, 27% of refugeehosting countries included refugees in
their national health insurance schemes
on the same basis as nationals. While
much needs to be done, an encouraging
survey of 48 refugee-hosting countries
found 89.6% of refugees living with HIV
could get antiretroviral treatment (ART)
through national health systems. UNHCR
supported HIV-related activities in more
than 50 countries, helping HIV services
for populations of concern to continue
during the pandemic. As a co-sponsor
of UNAIDS, UNHCR worked with partners
at national, regional and global levels
to scale up services available to
adolescents, to improve health and
protection services for people who sell
or exchange sex, and to strengthen
tuberculosis programming and linkages
with HIV care. UNHCR provided funds to
15 country operations while 23 country
operations mobilized additional UNAIDS
resources at country level to advance HIV
related services for refugees. Sexual and
reproductive health services were scaled
up for adolescents and young women
in Malawi and harm reduction services
were provided to people who inject
drugs in Pakistan. In South Sudan, over
13,000 people received HIV counselling
and testing and nearly 50,000 people
benefited from HIV awareness-raising
sessions, while in Uganda more than
1.5 million condoms were distributed,
more than 180,000 people received HIV
counselling and over 1,800 cases of TB
were identified and initiated on treatment.
Advocacy with national governments and
international donors has increasingly
given people of concern access to HIV
services under the same conditions
as nationals.

Operational highlights
In Europe, refugee health workers were
involved in national COVID-19 responses,
with increasing employment of refugee
doctors and health workers. Across the
Middle East and North Africa, over

24,000 outreach volunteers worked
closely with UNHCR and partners and
66,000 visits were conducted to support
families in remote areas and other people
with specific needs.
In 20 refugee camps in Chad, a threemonth supply of ART was given to refugees
and host community members living with
HIV through community-based distribution,
using counsellors to reduce the need for
monthly clinic visits. A WhatsApp group
for psychosocial counsellors was created,
and nearly 1,000 refugees living with HIV
benefited from the remote communication
and support.

Challenges and unmet needs
UNHCR made it a priority to ensure
continuation of care and health service
provision to refugees during the
COVID-19 pandemic. It adapted to ensure
continued access to pre- and postnatal
care, delivery by skilled attendant, family
planning, adolescent sexual and
reproductive health, and HIV prevention,
treatment and related care. Despite these
additional measures, UNHCR’s Health
Information System showed lower
utilization of health services for refugees,
with 6,219,345 outpatient consultations,
13% down from 2019. The number of
measles vaccinations administered to
children under 5 decreased by 9.5%
to 113,780.
UNHCR continues to advocate for the
inclusion of refugees and others of
concern in national vaccination plans.
By December 2020, 52% of countries
had included refugees in their national
COVID-19 vaccination plans. UNHCR is
a member of the Inter-Agency Standing

Mental health and
psychosocial support
© UNHCR/ Diego Ibarra Sánchez

Syrian refugee Fahima Al-Daher leaves the Makhzoumi Foundation in Beirut with her daughter, who is getting psychological support at the foundation after
the port explosion in Beirut, Lebanon.

Results and achievements
COVID-19 disrupted social support
systems, devastated incomes and
livelihood opportunities, and heightened
anxieties about falling ill. For those already
dealing with the stress of being uprooted,
this created an added psychological
burden. Many who previously coped well
were less able to cope with the multiple
stressors generated by the pandemic,
which abruptly raised new threats to
freedom of movement, social support
systems, education and social contact.
Women and children especially faced
increased protection risks, including
intimate partner violence, sexual abuse
and exploitation. Even the overflow of
information, sometimes contradictory
or false, fuelled stress levels.
UNHCR adapted and scaled up its
response to identify and assist people

206 U N H C R G LO B A L R E P O R T 2 02 0

of concern with mental health and
psychosocial issues. In 2020,
647,068 people were supported in six
overarching areas:
•	 Community messaging about coping
with distress;
•	 Training first responders in
psychological first aid and basic
psychosocial skills;
•	 Providing psychological support
through helplines;
•	 Increasing capacity to provide
psychological therapies for refugees;
•	 Ensuring continuation of care
for people with mental health
conditions; and
•	 Ensuring people with severe
protection risks continue to receive
psychosocial support.

It is important to communicate clearly
about risks and how people can protect
themselves. In Bangladesh, UNHCR and
Translators without Borders made audio
versions of the inter-agency children’s
book My hero is you to help community
outreach volunteers explain to children
about COVID-19 in Rohingya, Burmese
and Bangla languages. Many UNHCR
operations set up or expanded helplines
to keep in contact with people of concern
and link those in need to available
services. In Iraq, UNHCR provided training
on remote psychosocial support to the
helpline operators of the Iraq Information
Centre, a nationwide telephone service
that provides information and referral
assistance to IDPs and refugees. In Niger,
more than 300 responders (UNHCR
and partners) were trained online in
psychological first aid, a set of skills to
provide supportive and practical help
to people suffering crisis events.
Where remote support was not practical
or possible, wider use of communitybased workers and adapted facility-based
care allowed person-to-person support
to continue. Physical distancing and
restrictions on movement made
psychotherapy difficult, and some
group-based therapies had to be stopped
or adapted.
In Colombia, UNHCR provided telephone
and face-to-face psychosocial care,
including for persons with disabilities,
referring them when necessary for
hospital consultations, psychiatric
assessment and access to controlled
medications.
In Zambia, restrictions on large gatherings
forced UNHCR to cancel mental health
training for primary health care staff.
Instead, two trainers from the National
Mental Health Resources Centre in
Lusaka travelled to give on-the-job
supervision and training in smaller groups,
while observing physical distancing.

Operational highlights
Many local UNHCR offices and partners
acted to fortify the mental health of
humanitarian responders during the
pandemic, including refugee volunteers.
In Egypt, UNHCR’s partner PSTIC
offered support and appreciation to
its staff, mostly refugees themselves,
who ran a nightly DJ or comedy show.
All psychosocial workers had regular
individual online supervision and a
monthly online support group.
In Greece, refugees and asylum-seekers
were trained as paraprofessionals to
address psychosocial needs, bridging
national mental health and social services
and staffing helplines in Arabic, English,
Farsi and Greek, offering psychosocial
support, information about COVID-19,
liaising with protection services, and
providing referrals to psychological or
psychiatric specialists.

Challenges and unmet needs
Despite efforts to adapt to COVID-19,
mental health consultations decreased
everywhere except in the United Republic
of Tanzania and Yemen. Overall, there
were 137,880 consultations, 14% down
from 2019. While innovative methods
were employed to support people of
concern, the inability to physically interact
made it hard to provide the support
required. The pandemic will continue
to affect people’s mental well-being,
especially if socioeconomic repercussions
continue. UNHCR will keep mental health
and psychosocial support at the forefront
of its response.

647,068 refugees

and other people of concern
provided with mental health
and psychosocial support
services in 75 countries.

137,880 consultations
provided for mental health,
neurological and substance
use conditions in refugee
health facilities.
2019 result: 161,137.

35% of countries hosting
more than 50,000 refugees
had a multisectoral technical
working group for mental
health and psychosocial
support.

29% of refugee

operations introduced
evidence-based psychological
treatments.

Gender-based violence: prevention,
risk mitigation and response

Reintegration Centre in Kananga, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

Global Strategic Priorities
Gender-based violence
See p. 13 for GSP result

16.09 million

refugees and IDPs had access
to protection services,
including gender-based
violence and child protection
services in 151 countries.

74% of countries (115 of
155) where gender-based
violence services were
maintained or expanded in
response to COVID-19.

Results and achievements
Gender-based violence is a serious and
under-reported human rights violation that
disproportionately affects women and
girls. COVID-19 dramatically increased the
risk of gender-based violence, reversing
important gains in gender equality. The
pandemic put women and girls at greater
risk of intimate partner violence and
sexual exploitation due to lockdown
measures, restrictions of movement and
economic insecurity. However, it also
made it harder for them to access
education, information and services such
as safe houses and case management
facilities. In many countries, women
subjected to intimate partner violence,
and LGBTIQ+ people living within nonaccepting households, were confined with
their abusers—presenting life-threatening
risks combined with a reduced ability
to seek help. It was critical to increase
and adapt gender-based violence
programming to respond adequately.

208 U N H C R G LO B A L R E P O R T 2 02 0

The release of the “UNHCR policy on the
prevention, risk mitigation and response
to gender-based violence” in October
2020 instituted nine core actions to
advance quality programming and
coordination across UNHCR. The policy
acknowledged that gender-based
violence is rooted in the imbalance of
power and recognized gender-based
violence programming as life-saving.
In response to COVID-19, UNHCR
adapted its gender-based violence
programming by strengthening its
collaboration with community/women-led
organizations and local partners,
expanding remote case management
services and updating gender-based
violence referral pathways to reflect the
pandemic’s impact on survivors’ needs.
In Egypt, cash assistance was delivered
as part of holistic gender-based violence
case management programming, which is
designed to respond to the full spectrum
of needs survivors face during their

recovery. Many operations created or
expanded communication channels for
survivors such as 24/7 emergency
hotlines (e.g. Kenya, Pakistan, South
Sudan and Zambia). UNHCR and partners
assisted 2 million women and girls via
24/7 gender-based violence hotlines. In
Colombia remote case management was
provided through 29 information kiosks
and gender-based violence focal points.
This required transitioning from in-person
comprehensive case management
services to phone-based services focused
on one-time crisis counselling to connect
survivors with services for their immediate
needs and safety concerns.
In more than three quarters of the
63 countries in the Global Humanitarian
Response Plan, UNHCR operations
reported that they had maintained or
expanded gender-based violence
services in response to COVID-19. A total
of 64,796 survivors received psychosocial
counselling, 3,297 received legal
assistance and 5,736 medical assistance.
Through the Safe from the Start
programme, UNHCR deployed senior
gender-based violence specialist staff to
12 operations, including L2 and L3
emergencies, such as Burkina Faso,
Burundi, Mali, Sudan and Yemen.

Operational highlights
In many countries, forcibly displaced
women play a leading role in the
response to gender-based violence. In
the Syrian Arab Republic, UNHCR and its
partners worked with a network of
91 women to share information on
COVID-19 prevention measures and the
availability of legal and medical services
for gender-based violence survivors. In
Malawi, 14 refugee-led community-based
organizations served as community focal
points for referral of survivors.

The need to keep services running
remotely despite COVID-19 spurred
innovative approaches. Information
campaigns were developed and
disseminated via WhatsApp in Mexico,
and internally displaced, stateless and
refugee communities were reached via
Instagram, Facebook, and rural radio in
Burkina Faso, Côte d’Ivoire, Niger, Nigeria
and Senegal. More information on field
practices can be found in the COVID-19
and gender-based violence protection brief.

Challenges and unmet needs
The pandemic limited the capacity to
deliver and access gender-based violence
prevention, risk mitigation and response
programming. It increased the risks of
experiencing intimate partner violence,
sexual violence, child marriage and the
sale or exchange of sex as a coping
mechanism. Despite the increase of
gender-based violence during COVID-19related lockdowns, Gender-Based
Violence Information Management
System reports showed a general decline
of incident reporting in 2020 across the
34 countries using the system. UNHCR
did not meet its target for medical
assistance to be provided to survivors,
mainly due to restrictions on movement.
Many operations reported disruptions
and significant challenges in accessing
gender-based violence services, such as
medical examinations required prior to
admission to different shelters, or the refusal
to receive additional survivors because of
COVID-19 social distancing rules.
While the need for gender equality and
gender-based violence interventions has
never been greater, the pandemic shed
further light on the chronic and severe
under-funding of the gender-based violence
sector in humanitarian settings, with dire
consequences for refugee and forcibly
displaced women and girls in particular.

Nutrition and food security

UNHCR supports a canteen providing food to refugees and locals in Quito, Ecuador.

Global Strategic Priorities
Global acute malnutrition
See p. 13 for GSP result

140,059

children
6-59 months were admitted
for treatment of moderate acute
malnutrition in 29 countries.
2019 result: 90,364.

55,183 children

6-59 months were admitted
for treatment of severe acute
malnutrition in 28 countries.
2019 result: 41,718.

Results and achievements
When people are forced to flee their
homes, access to and availability of food
often becomes irregular and insecure,
creating a risk of malnutrition and hunger
while increasing vulnerability to exploitation
and sexual abuse. COVID-19 compounded
these risks and profoundly affected
UNHCR’s nutrition and food security
programmes in terms of quality and scale.
UNHCR normally conducts Standardized
Expanded Nutrition Surveys (SENS)
across 100 sites in 15 countries each year,
gaining crucial data on the nutritional
status of refugees. The lockdown and
restrictions caused by the pandemic
forced cancellation or delay of the
majority of the SENS surveys planned
by 54 operations in 2020.
To understand the implications of
COVID-19 mitigation on nutrition and food
security, UNHCR assessed how its
operations were adapting food
assistance, cash assistance, community
management of acute malnutrition,
the blanket supplementary feeding
programme (BSFP), infant and young child
feeding programmes (IYCF), nutrition
surveys and surveillance, the school feeding
programme, and nutrition support at
COVID-19 quarantine and isolation centres.
Data from 12 operations in Africa and one
in Asia, covering 60 sites, showed most
adjusted their activities to allow continuity

210 U N H C R G LO B A L R E P O R T 2 02 0

of services without adding to COVID-19
risks. For operations where food
assistance was provided, adjustments
included scheduling more distribution
days, giving two months of rations instead
of one, and pre-packing food or switching
to cash assistance. Food distribution
became quicker, less crowded and less
frequent. Similar adjustments were made
to BSFP, a prevention of malnutrition
programme. With mass screening for
acute malnutrition suspended in most
places, some operations increased
house-to-house screening by community
health workers, and introduced new
avenues for community screening, such
as mother-to-mother support groups
and household screening by mothers/
caretakers. Nutrition clinics reworked
their schedules to have fewer children
visiting at once and simplified their
procedures to reduce physical contact.
The figure opposite shows the number
of operations that applied various
adaptations to the management of acute
malnutrition in response to COVID-19
pandemic. In 2020, 55,183 children aged
6-59 months with severe acute
malnutrition (SAM) and 140,059 with
moderate acute malnutrition (MAM) were
admitted into treatment programmes
for rehabilitation across 32 countries.
A joint UNHCR/WFP hub was established
to help operations better assess
vulnerability to food insecurity, economic
vulnerability and protection risks, and

target or prioritize assistance to those
most in need, with a longer term aim to
support programming for greater refugee
inclusion and self-reliance. The hub team
provided support to operations in
Cameroon, the Democratic Republic
of the Congo, Jordan, Mauritania,
Mozambique, Rwanda and Zambia.
With COVID-19 prompting school closures,
in Bangladesh, Kenya and Rwanda
UNHCR and WFP adapted school feeding
programmes to individual contexts.
In west Rwanda, school feeding rations
were included in the general food
distribution; in Kakuma, Kenya, students
attending online schooling were given
a snack to ensure their nutrition needs
were met and to encourage e-learning
enrolment. In Cox’s Bazar, Bangladesh,
families with students received high
energy biscuits, provided by WFP, as
part of the general food distribution.

Operational highlights
In Algeria, Bangladesh, Chad, Ethiopia,
Kenya, Rwanda, South Sudan and
Uganda, UNHCR supplied families
with tapes to measure mid-upper arm
circumference (MUAC), a rapid screening
tool for acute malnutrition, and provided
training on their appropriate use. This
allowed them to screen their children
and self-refer if necessary, while reducing
social contact. UNHCR operations in
Chad, Rwanda and South Sudan
innovated with radio and text messages
to ensure uninterrupted messaging on
IYCF—key for child survival, nutrition and
development—and supported mothers
with suspected or confirmed COVID-19
with information on respiratory hygiene
during breastfeeding, as well as mental
health support.

Challenges and unmet needs
Operational adaptations and innovations
largely mitigated the pandemic’s impact,
but the use of simplified treatment
protocols, reduced frequency of follow-up

visits, suspension of mass active case
finding/screening of malnourished
children, suspension of mass/group
nutrition education, suspension of school
feeding and suspension of SENS surveys
were likely to have negative implications.
The pandemic led to some groups such
as urban refugees needing additional
support. It created new operational
challenges and required additional
staff and more resources, such as PPE,
sanitization materials and individual,
not shared, nutrition measurement tools.
The family MUAC roll-out meant a
shortage of MUAC tapes, and there
were pipeline breaks in some nutrition
commodities, delays in food assistance
delivery, funding cuts and inadequate
staff/technical capacity.
Humanitarian food assistance for
refugees decreased in many operations,
leading to a sharp increase in global food
insecurity. Refugees struggled to meet
their food and other basic needs,
engaging increasingly in negative coping
strategies that put health and nutrition at
risk. These changes and challenges will
have undone some gains made towards
reducing malnutrition and promoting
optimal outcomes. Measures to mitigate
the potential negative impact remain key,
and operations will need resources to
bridge the various gaps.

malnutrition (<10%).

Challenges and unmet needs

(including 61 donated to authorities and
288 to health facilities), distributed
65,000 bars of soap and disinfected
1,599 community buildings. In the Meri
site and at household level, UNHCR
promoted “Tippy Taps”–handwashing
stations made by trained refugees with
recycled materials.

Results and achievements
The seemingly simple act of washing
one’s hands is considered one of the most
effective acts to stop the spread of
COVID-19. In reality though, in 2020,
3 billion people lacked soap and water at
home to practise good hand hygiene and
40% of healthcare facilities were not
equipped with handwashing stations at
points of care.
For many of the people of concern to
UNHCR, particularly refugees, these dire
conditions marred their daily lives and
made COVID-19 prevention extremely
challenging.
WASH programming is fundamentally
multisectoral. All sectors and operational
areas experience the impact of adequate
or, more importantly, inadequate access
to WASH services. UNHCR’s COVID-19
WASH preparedness and response was
comprehensive and far-reaching. From
increasing hand-washing facilities in high

212 U N H C R G LO B A L R E P O R T 2 02 0

risk public places, to communicating
culturally appropriate messages to foster
behaviour changes, to distributing cash
assistance and hygiene supplies, UNHCR
focused on strengthening and adapting
WASH services in living areas, health care
facilities and schools.
In emergencies, the minimum standard for
daily water consumption is 15 litres per
person, for drinking, personal hygiene,
washing and cooking. Encouragingly, the
average daily amount of potable water
available increased from 21 to 25 litres
per person during 2020.

Operational highlights
The Democratic Republic of the
Congo hosts 490,200 refugees and
5.2 million IDPs. COVID-19 came on the
heels of Ebola and measles epidemics
that claimed more than 4,700 lives. To
reduce the spread of COVID-19, UNHCR
installed 2,122 hand-washing stations

It leveraged the most popular medium,
radio, to respond to questions and myths
on COVID-19 through call-in radio talk
shows. To amplify these messages, “boda
boda” or “mobile radios”—motorbikes with
loudspeakers that broadcast radio shows
and songs—drove through communities
to reach as many people as possible.
UNHCR worked with refugees and IDPs
to create culturally and linguistically
appropriate public service announcements,
radio shows and jingles about
COVID-19. Refugees wrote, recorded and
performed their own COVID-19
awareness-raising songs.

Whilst the focus has been on increasing
the provision of water in UNHCR
operations and the various innovative
solutions implemented in country
operations, at the end of 2020 only 43%
of people of concern had at least 20 litres
of safe water per day. Further efforts are
required to ensure that people of concern
to UNHCR can enjoy one of their most
basic rights.
Accessibility remains one of the main
challenges. Many field operations are
located in deeply remote areas where
UNHCR is often the sole service
provider for refugees. In some instances,
UNHCR works with refugees in difficult
operational conditions that are already
impacted by conflict, climate change
and extremely limited resources. Building
on 2020 achievements, to respond
to these challenges that were further
exacerbated by COVID-19, UNHCR
and the WASH partners will focus on
redesigning and installing additional
WASH facilities to decrease COVID-19
transmission rates; leveraging refugee
voices to communicate about COVID-19;
and expanding cash assistance
when COVID-related economic losses
endanger hygiene practices.

In Niger, nearly 140,000 IDPs and
60,000 refugees are often housed in
overcrowded conditions. UNHCR worked
with the authorities to identify
overcrowded sites and initiate site
planning to ensure the necessary
distance between shelters. UNHCR also
helped to set up isolation units and boost
health care infrastructure.
With its NGO partners, UNHCR provided
cash assistance to displaced and conflictaffected people with specific needs,
including people stranded at checkpoints
along the contact line in eastern Ukraine
and prevented by COVID-19 restrictions
from returning to non-governmentcontrolled areas. Cash assistance helped
them rent apartments close to the
checkpoints and stay in dignified spaces
while waiting for permission to cross.

Physical distancing is fundamental to
containing COVID-19 but requires space.
Displaced populations often live in
overcrowded conditions in camps,
makeshift settlements or urban centres.
In 2020, a primary focus for UNHCR was
the development of context-specific
guidance to support national emergency
responses, particularly with the
establishment of emergency hospitals,
quarantine and isolation areas, and the
expansion of medical facilities to create
additional space for triage and testing.
UNHCR’s COVID-19 response emphasized
the need to provide shelter, modify
existing homes and build isolation and
quarantine centres to support national
authorities in managing caseloads. In
2020, the number of emergency shelters
provided increased by 58%, enabling
more people of concern to practise
physical distancing and have space for
isolation or quarantine.
UNHCR provided 362,691 people with
shelter-related relief items, helping
those modifying their homes to create
additional space. It built 268 isolation
centres, enhancing national triage capacity.

approach”, a framework for spatial
design of humanitarian settlements,
and jointly developed a comprehensive

Teknaf sub-districts in Cox’s Bazar,
Bangladesh.

Operational highlights

home to over 22,000 refugees, space
inside residents’ houses was limited.
With COVID-19 magnifying the risks
of overcrowding, UNHCR and the
Government of Bangladesh piloted an
alternative shelter design to increase
internal floor space. By adding a mezzanine
floor, the total shelter area rose from
21m2 to 36m2, giving families 69% more
space without needing more land.

Challenges and unmet needs
Restricted funding was the main obstacle
in meeting widespread shelter needs.
Operations consistently cited

To this end, UNHCR will place additional
focus on cash-for-rent programmes and
innovative shelter designs, as in
Bangladesh, to increase living space
without using more land.

91,782 households
received cash grants for
rental accommodation.

Results and achievements

During 2020, UNHCR distributed
9,000 refugee housing units and
10,160 tents—emergency shelter for
approximately 100,000 individuals—
decongesting collective centres and
settlements to reduce transmission
and provide dignified shelter options.

underfunding as the reason for being
unable to achieve shelter targets. In
Ethiopia, for example, underfunding
severely limited shelter interventions in
six refugee camps for Eritrean refugees.
A significant number lived in deteriorated
mud brick and/or communal shelters
with iron sheeting walls and roofs, with
8-10 people under one roof, not the
standard five per household. COVID-19
demonstrated the risks of having limited
space, especially in urban areas. In Brazil,
loss of income in the pandemic greatly
reduced people’s ability to host
Venezuelans, making NGO-run centres
vital. But UNHCR’s limited funding meant
it was unable to support four centres that
closed, with the loss of 47% of slots for
people with special needs such as
gender-based violence survivors, older
persons and persons with disabilities.

SPOTLIGHT: Data visualization
casts light on displaced people's
deprivation amid the pandemic
As the world battled the coronavirus, UNHCR
highlighted how acutely vulnerable displaced
populations must contend with extreme
overcrowding and limited access to basics such
as soap and water. “Space, shelter and scarce resources – coping with COVID-19”
is a data visualization that shows just how hard it is for refugees and IDPs to keep
to physical distancing rules and advice on handwashing—key to controlling the
spread of the virus.
“Having access to basic services such as health care, sanitation and a decent shelter
to call home are essential for all human beings to live with dignity. Yet this is not
the reality for millions of refugees and other displaced persons around the world,”
says Raouf Mazou, UNHCR’s Assistant High Commissioner for Operations. “While
COVID-19 has affected us all, refugees already living with uncertainty have been
disproportionately impacted.”
The data visualization also shows how UNHCR is responding to support displaced
communities all over the world to face the challenges posed by the pandemic.

Finding durable solutions so that refugees
can rebuild their lives and live in peace is
fundamental to UNHCR’s work.

Building
better futures
ydfydfdxf

In 2020, the resilience of refugees and
their host communities was tested by the
COVID-19 pandemic. Education, a lifeline
for refugee children, was all but shut down
by COVID-19: 95% of refugee children
were affected by school closures, and
online learning and virtual classrooms
remained little more than a dream for
most. The economic downturn damaged
incomes and employment opportunities,
leaving displaced populations struggling
to meet their basic needs.

The traditional durable solutions include
voluntary repatriation, resettlement and
local integration, as well as other local
solutions and complementary pathways
for admission to third countries, which may
provide additional opportunities. Enabling
refugees’ resilience goes hand-in-hand
with achieving durable solutions.
Enhancing the self-reliance of refugees
and other people of concern is a crucial
component of the Global Compact on
Refugees. Better self-reliance means
refugees and host communities are better
able to meet their essential needs, enjoy
their human rights and live with dignity.
Ensuring they have quality education,
livelihoods opportunities and access to
safe and sustainable energy benefits both
host communities and people of concern
to UNHCR.

Solutions were significantly scarcer,
mostly due to the closure of borders, and
resilience was more vital, highlighting the
need for innovative approaches. UNHCR
worked with States and partners, including
IOM, to adapt to the risks and restrictions
brought by the pandemic, modifying
processing and departure modalities to
mitigate to the extent possible the serious
impact of COVID-19 on those in the
resettlement or complementary pathways
process, and finding ways to support
voluntary repatriation for those wishing to
return home, while respecting COVID-19

measures. The pandemic also reinforced
the importance of refugee inclusion in
national public health responses and
national and local preparedness plans,
education systems, labour markets and
social services.
The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable
Development’s call of “leave no one behind”
and the Global Compact on Refugees’ goal
of predictable and equitable responsibilitysharing cannot be achieved without
international cooperation.
In 2020, UNHCR continued to foster its
relationships with development actors.
It strengthened its relationship with
the World Bank and other multilateral
development banks, building the
collaboration on data with the UNHCRWorld Bank Joint Data Center on Forced
Displacement and deepening collaboration
with bilateral development partnerships.
This chapter covers UNHCR’s response
at global and operational level, including
innovative practices, progress made,
and challenges that must be overcome
to achieve comprehensive solutions for
people of concern.

Informing solutions through data and evidence
A World Bank-UNHCR initiative launched at the end of 2019, the Joint Data Center on Forced Displacement (JDC),
leverages partnerships and innovation in its focus on the collection, analysis, dissemination and use of primary
socioeconomic microdata and population data to inform policymaking and programming. The JDC work programme is
structured around four strategic objectives:
i. strengthen systems and standards;
ii. produce data and analysis;
iii. enhance safe and responsible data access; and
iv. build evidence and share knowledge.
It supports country- and regional-level engagement to increase the coverage of socioeconomic data on populations
affected by forced displacement, as well as global systemic efforts to strengthen norms and standards on statistics that will
improve the quality of data collected. The 2020 work programme included around 40 activities, with the largest share of the
budget invested in primary data collection.

Delivering through partnerships

Global Strategic Priorities
Protection and solutions
See p. 15 for GSP results

The pandemic raised the demand for comparable socioeconomic data to understand the impact of the crisis on both
national populations and people of concern. The JDC publication “Highly vulnerable yet largely invisible” (December
2020), provided a stock-take of available evidence and highlighted a significant absence of data. To this end, UNHCR has
contributed to the inclusion of forcibly displaced people into national high frequency phone surveys in more than a dozen
countries, in some cases working in collaboration with the JDC. This data–made easily available to partners, governments
and researchers–measures changes in employment, access to service, and behaviours, helping to inform evidence-based
programming, policy and advocacy efforts. The findings from surveys are highlighted in a series of country specific briefs.

Engagement with development actors and processes
In line with the call in the Global Compact on Refugees (GCR) for responsibility and burden-sharing (particularly
paragraph 35), UNHCR redoubled efforts to expand its collaboration with multilateral development banks and
strengthen systematic engagement with bilateral development agencies and institutions. The value of these
partnerships was particularly evident in the context of COVID-19, which prompted many development agencies to focus on the
importance of including refugees in national responses. The World Bank showed strong leadership and support to low- and
middle-income countries in fighting COVID-19, taking dedicated measures to ensure refugees and other people of concern were
included in national response efforts. This included making up to $1 billion available in grants under the IDA19 Window for Host
Communities and Refugees (WHR) in the fiscal year from 1 July 2020 and systematically including refugees in all COVID-19
vaccination campaigns supported by the World Bank. The UNHCR-World Bank partnership thrived, with close cooperation on policy
and programme development, data and analytics, and knowledge management. Collaboration on data was led by the Joint Data
Center on Forced Displacement launched in late 2019. Operational collaboration focused on projects in 14 low-income countries in
Africa and Asia under the bank’s IDA18 Refugee Sub-Window (RSW), under its new WHR, and within the Global Concessional
Financing Facility for middle-income countries. UNHCR and the World Bank worked on developing a Refugee Policy Review
Framework, a tool for assessing refugee policy and institutional environments in countries eligible for the WHR.
Collaboration with other regional development banks increased. Partnership with the African Development Bank bore fruit in
particular with multi-year projects including $20.5 million for the COVID-19 response in the Sahel. Such dedicated investments
for refugees and host communities are a concrete manifestation of the burden-sharing promised by the international community
in the Global Compact on Refugees. In 2020, UNHCR also advocated for forced displacement to be integrated in policies,
programmes and planning carried out by bilateral development actors such as the French Development Agency (AFD), the
German Federal Ministry of Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ), the European Union’s Directorate-General for
International Partnerships (INTPA) and the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA). The collaboration with BMZ gained
momentum with commitments to systematically extend the partnership at country level and in flagship technical sectors
including energy and vocational training. Cooperation on BMZ’s dedicated financial instrument for forced displacement
advanced. This reflected a key tenet of the GCR: using dedicated tools for funding to share burdens and responsibilities, thereby
enhancing the predictability and consistency of development funding in refugee-hosting areas. In 2020, UNHCR worked on
establishing country and regional-level channels of communication between UNHCR and the European Commission, with the
specific aim of informing 2021-2027 development programming by the EU in forced displacement contexts. UNHCR collaborated
with other UN agencies to promote long-term solutions for refugees. It supported the ILO’s drive to create sustainable decent
work opportunities for refugees and host communities and strengthened partnerships with UNICEF to streamline country-level
collaboration, as well as working with UNDP on ways to integrate displacement into development initiatives. Two new projects in
Chad and Sudan were added to UNHCR’s portfolio with the UN Peacebuilding Fund, confirming the GCR’s commitment towards
supporting returns to countries and communities of origin in safety and dignity.

SPOTLIGHT: Monitoring and mitigating the socioeconomic impact of COVID-19
Timely socioeconomic data on forcibly displaced populations is essential to understanding the conditions of
people of concern and informing an evidence-based programmatic response. Newly collected data in a
growing number of countries–available in UNHCR’s microdata library–provides insight on how the COVID-19 pandemic is
affecting what are already highly vulnerable forcibly displaced populations.
Periodic polling by Kenya’s rapid response phone survey showed that in contrast to national households refugees had
greater and growing anxiety about the pandemic, reflecting concerns about money, food shortages, school closures and
access to health facilities (Figure 1). Moreover, the wide gap in the employment rates of nationals and camp-based
refugees was sustained during the pandemic as a result of widespread job losses (Figure 2).

UNHCR procured and distributed
5,500 radios and school kits to enable
children to participate in interactive radio
programming in Mali. The Office also
re-purposed cash grants for education to
fund access to data and connectivity in
Egypt and distributed printed materials
and exercises for children along with food
rations in Indonesia. Furthermore, UNHCR
ensured that teachers’ salaries were paid
even when schools were closed in Chad,
Kenya, Malawi, Mauritania, Pakistan,
Rwanda, South Sudan, Sudan, Uganda
and Yemen.

COVID-19 had a profound impact.
Closure of schools, non-formal learning
programmes, after-school centres and
universities disrupted education at all
levels. While most governments and
institutions introduced programmes to
support the continuity of learning, many
refugee learners lacked the required
connectivity or hardware (textbooks,
laptops, smartphones, tablets, radios or
televisions), or lived too far from broadcast
signals. Specific needs of children with
disabilities were often not (or inadequately)
accommodated in home-based learning.
Many refugee girls faced increased
protection risks and domestic
responsibilities during school closures,
jeopardizing home-based learning and
future educational prospects. University
closures meant many refugee students
lost student housing or were sent back
to refugee camps.

Parent-teacher collaboration in Chad
ensured 4,000 Sudanese and Chadian
secondary school pupils could prepare
for national exams. In September,
1,209 refugees (57% girls) sat for the
national baccalaureate exam: a major
success in a challenging year. Whilst
COVID-19 highlighted the digital divide,
Connected Education initiatives such as
expansion of the Kolibri learning platform
in Uganda supported learning at home
for exam-grade pupils.

UNHCR worked at all stages of the
COVID-19 response to address emerging
challenges, advocating for the inclusion
of refugees in national response plans
and providing guidance on connected
education for no-, low- and high-tech
environments. There was an urgent need
to upgrade WASH infrastructure in schools
in refugee camps and settlements as
facilities do not meet UNHCR standards.
In some locations over 400 children used
a single handwashing point.

Of the approximately 10 million refugee
children and youth under UNHCR care
in 2020, 7.1 million were of school age.
Their access to education was limited,
with 3.4 million unable to attend school.
At primary level, 77% of refugee children
were enrolled. More displaced children were
enrolled in secondary school than ever
before, with enrolment up 2%, but still low
at 31%. However, the gains favoured boys,
and 36% of refugee boys were in secondary
education, but only 27% of girls. Just 3% of
refugee students were in higher education.
In 2020, all those enrolled in school were
negatively affected by school closures,
and the number out of school may rise
in coming years as students struggle to
make up for the pandemic disruption.
UNHCR strove to increase access to
education and the quality of education,
despite the disruption of COVID-19.
With the support of Educate A Child,
a programme of the Education Above
All Foundation, 15 country operations
strengthened primary education
programming. UNHCR led the Accelerated
Education Working Group (AEWG) and set
up the Secondary Education Working
Group, joining with 11 international NGOs,

UNHCR’s tertiary scholarship programme
(DAFI) helped 7,087 refugees study in
54 countries of asylum in 2020, with a new
scholarship programme in the Democratic
Republic of the Congo for 30 students.
Only 230 new students were enrolled
in 2020 due to funding constraints and
COVID-19. Connected education came
to the fore in 2020, and the Connected
Learning in Crisis Consortium grew to
33 members, supporting 55,000 learners
with tertiary bridging or professional
development programmes and
3,000 degree-based learners.
UNHCR helped 934,000 students in
74 countries to learn during school
closures, with allowances for online classes
and support for new teaching
approaches—remote learning, audio and
video lessons, and notes and feedback
sent via WhatsApp. At tertiary level, many
DAFI programme partners continued
student support through remote check-ins,
counselling and informational updates.
As schools prepared to reopen, UNHCR
surveyed school water and sanitation
facilities globally, issued guidelines on safe
reopening, provided health and hygiene
training for teachers, and—through its
AEWG leadership—developed and
disseminated resources to help learners

Results and achievements
In 2020, UNHCR stepped up livelihoods
support and mobilized resources and
partnerships to mitigate the
socioeconomic impact of COVID-19.
Advocacy was reinforced for refugees’
inclusion in national social protection,
socioeconomic statistics and economic
development plans. National statistics
offices and the World Bank included
refugees in high frequency phone surveys
on the socioeconomic impact of COVID-19
in Djibouti, Ethiopia, Kenya, Morocco and
Uganda. Governments included people
of concern to UNHCR in COVID-19 social
assistance programmes in Brazil,
Colombia, the Republic of the Congo,
Ecuador, Mauritania, Mexico, Panama,
South Africa and Uruguay.
UNHCR allocated over $113 million
towards implementing livelihoods
activities in 2020. UNHCR and partners
supported 1,259,477 individuals with
protection of productive assets, training,
finances to facilitate business creation

222 U N H C R G LO B A L R E P O R T 2 02 0

and recovery, wage employment and
agricultural work. 43% of people of
concern aged 15 or older had a basic
financial account—a mobile money
account or an account with a financial
institution.
The Poverty Alleviation Coalition provided
self-reliance support to 13,711 households
in 2020 using the “graduation approach”,
significantly more than in previous years, but
far from the 50,000 households expected,
mainly due to the 88% underfunding of
the Coalition’s programmes.
UNHCR significantly increased
collaboration with development partners to
improve digital skills, advocating for more
women entrepreneurs and supporting
women and girls with training and
computers to increase labour market
opportunities. COVID-related restrictions
made digital technology crucial.
8,115 refugees in over 70 countries enrolled
in UNHCR learning on the Coursera for
Refugees platform, up from 1,400 in 2019.

In 13 of the 19 countries where UNHCR
implements MADE51, a flagship brand of
refugee-made products, refugees and
local enterprise partners made essential
personal protective equipment, including
hundreds of thousands of face masks.
Refugee-made products reached local
and international markets, boosting
income-earning opportunities and
positive sentiment towards refugees,
particularly following the launch of
the MADE51 online shop on World Refugee
Day 2020. UNHCR’s MADE51 project
enabled 2,700 refugees and host-country
artisans to maintain an income in 2020.

Operational highlights
In Uganda, UNHCR’s partnership with
the Swedish International Development
Cooperation Agency (Sida) and the
Grameen Crédit Agricole Foundation
helped two microfinance institutions
extend their services to over
5,000 refugees and host communities.
Mexican bank BanCoppel opened up its
services to refugees, while South Africa
included refugees in its financial
inclusion policy.
Agricultural activities were supported
in several countries in Africa. In Zambia,
1,054 refugee and host farmers were
included in the national agriculture input
support programme. In Cameroon,

advocacy and partnering with national
and local authorities and actors led to a
10% increase in the number of refugeehosted households with access to
agricultural land.
Since 2017, UNHCR’s partnership with
Kiva, a non-profit microfinance
crowdfunding platform, has unlocked over
$20 million in small business loans for
over 20,000 refugees and IDPs in Brazil,
Colombia, Costa Rica, the Democratic
Republic of the Congo, Ecuador, Jordan,
Kenya, Lebanon, Mexico, Palestine,
Rwanda, Uganda and the United States
of America.

Challenges and unmet needs
COVID-19 had a disproportionate
socioeconomic impact on the forcibly
displaced. Refugees endured disruptions
in livelihoods and income, faced
challenges in covering basic needs, and
were often forced into premature returns
or negative coping mechanisms. Food
and cash cuts foreseen by WFP will
further weaken the protection and
socioeconomic situation of the people
of concern to UNHCR.
Monitoring showed that more than
60% of refugees could not meet even
half of their basic needs in 2020.
Displaced women and girls were
particularly impacted. In the Middle East
and North Africa, 84% of surveyed people
of concern reported a loss of livelihoods
and income. In Jordan, 35% of Syrian
refugees employed before COVID-19 lost
their jobs, compared to 17% of Jordanian
citizens. In Costa Rica, 59% of refugee
families reported steady work-related
income streams at the end of July 2020,
a staggering decrease from 93% before
the pandemic hit.

Seven in 10 people of concern to UNHCR
live in urban settings, and the pandemic
sharpened the challenge of supporting
them. Refugees in urban areas were around
60% more likely than host populations to
work in sectors that were hardest hit by
COVID-19, such as accommodation, food
services, manufacturing and retail.
UNHCR advocated for refugees to be
included in national responses.
Governments answered the call: among
people of concern to UNHCR living in cities,
92% had access to primary health care on
the same basis as nationals by the end of
2020, surpassing UNHCR’s 80% target a
year ahead of schedule. A successful
example was Lebanon, which hosts the
highest number of refugees per capita,
mainly Syrians living in extreme poverty in
residential buildings. Refugees in Lebanon
could get primary care, including for HIV
and tuberculosis, at centres run by the
Ministry of Public Health, and secondary
and tertiary care in several contracted
hospitals. Equitable access for the displaced
population and the vulnerable host
community was coordinated under the
Lebanon Crisis Response Plan, which
UNHCR helped guide on the basis of
evidence from health surveys and
assessments such as the Vulnerability

224 U N H C R G LO B A L R E P O R T 2 02 0

Assessment for Syrian Refugees in
Lebanon (VASyR), Health Access &
Utilization Surveys (HAUS) and
participatory assessments. While
governments stepped up to shield
refugees from COVID-19, UNHCR
bolstered their defences by distributing
PPE, extending hospitals, setting up triage
and isolation areas, and building up the
capacity of health workers and
communities to fight the disease.
UNHCR’s cash assistance and shelter
support worked in parallel with its health
interventions. Cash assistance helped
refugees weather the financial impact of
COVID-19, which often spelled loss of jobs
and income, rent arrears and food
insecurity. When the pandemic reached
Mauritania, UNHCR immediately made a
cash grant available for refugees living in
urban centres, prioritizing 1,028 households
without savings or social networks, at risk
of eviction and far from able to meet their
most urgent needs. The one-off payment
approximated 40% of the minimum
expenditure basket for three months.
Shelter support ranged from establishing
triage and isolation areas to providing
cash for rent and materials to build or
extend shelters. Many cities witnessed
a sharp increase in evictions as a result
of COVID-19 lockdowns. To mitigate such

a risk, UNHCR supported 1.3 million
households with cash assistance for rent
and increased its support for collective
shelters hosting vulnerable refugees and
asylum-seekers. In Tapachula, Mexico,
UNHCR and Hospitalidad y Solidaridad
A.C. inaugurated a 300-space shelter,
the country’s first exclusively for refugees
and asylum-seekers. UNHCR financed
construction of the shelter, which has solar
panels, a rainwater collection system,
natural ventilation and a garden producing
food for residents.

Operational highlights
In Brazil, UNHCR and the city of
São Paulo launched a joint protocol to
guide the assistance to transgender
migrant and refugee communities, aiming
to prevent discrimination in social
assistance and food distribution, fulfilling
a pledge submitted in the 2019 Global
Refugee Forum (GRF) to address
xenophobia and include people of
concern in national systems.
The Government of the Philippines issued
local government units with a legal
instruction to promote an inclusive
approach towards refugees, asylumseekers, and stateless persons in the
pandemic, aiming for equal treatment,

physical and legal safety, and inclusion
in education, livelihood and self-reliance
programmes. 
In Cameroon, UNHCR launched one-time
unrestricted cash assistance in four urban
locations for over 11,000 refugees reliant
on wages from the informal sector, and
facing immense challenges to pay for
rent, food and other basic needs because
of COVID-19. The cash assistance, which
also helped them comply with COVID-19
mitigation rules, was distributed as mobile
money in collaboration with financial
service provider MTN.

Challenges and unmet needs
Refugees, asylum-seekers, IDPs,
returnees and stateless persons often
find themselves living in poor shelters
where health, WASH, and education
services are overstretched or inaccessible
and national social safety nets, including
cash transfers, are not fully accessible.
Overall, refugees in urban areas—even
where the legal framework is enabling—
often face numerous obstacles to access
national services. The needs remain vast
and UNHCR will continue to work with
governments and partners to support
and facilitate the inclusion of refugees
whenever possible in national systems.

SPOTLIGHT: Cities stand with refugees against COVID-19
There were many excellent examples of cities supporting refugees as
part of their COVID-19 response, actions recognized by UNHCR on
31 October on World Cities Day and through the Cities #WithRefugees Campaign,
signed by over 260 cities in over 50 countries. Cities will continue to be encouraged
to communicate about initiatives they and their partners are undertaking to support
refugees. Participating cities in 2020 included Bergen (Norway), Durban (South
Africa), Ioannina (Greece), Quito (Ecuador), São Paulo (Brazil) and Victoria (Canada).
UNHCR partnered with the Mayors Migration Council (MMC) on the Global Cities
Fund for Inclusive Pandemic Response, a $1,000,000 initiative to respond to cities’
needs as they support migrants, refugees and IDPs during COVID-19. The 2021 Fund
was granted to Barranquilla (Colombia), Beirut (Lebanon), Freetown (Sierra Leone),
Lima (Peru) and Mexico City (Mexico).

UNHCR is striving to shrink its
environmental footprint, including by
improving waste management and
reducing field operations’ CO2 emissions.
Improvements in the packaging of kitchen
sets in 2020 reduced annual plastic and
cardboard waste by 47 and 43 tons per
year respectively. It established a $4 million
“green fund” to shift the energy source of
field operations including Ethiopia, Kenya
and Uganda from diesel to renewables.
UNHCR also initiated partnerships with
several international organizations and
implementing partners to address
deforestation and land degradation in
refugee settings. For instance, Land Life
implemented a reforestation project around
Minawao camp in Cameroon, achieving an
85% tree survival rate, above the country’s
55% average. In Bangladesh, the Center for
Natural Resource Studies (CNRS) worked
with UNHCR to enhance environmental
protection and natural hazard risk
mitigation around the Rohingya camps.

Results and achievements

1,624,789 people

of concern had access to a
sustainable source of cooking
fuel. Target: 1.6 million.
2019 result: 1.0 million.

1,724,199 people of

concern had access to a
sustainable source of
electricity. Target: 2.5 million.

Access to clean, affordable, and reliable
energy services is integral to humanitarian
response and essential for sustainable
economic development. Sustainable
energy services enable people of concern
to UNHCR to meet their energy needs in a
safe, sustainable and affordable way.

COVID-19 prevention required reliable and
adequate water supplies and thus
increased energy demand. That was a
challenge in many operations since only
43% of people of concern had access to at
least 20 litres of safe water per day. To this
end, UNHCR expanded the use of solarized
boreholes and water pumps which are
cost-efficient in the long run and require
less maintenance. 25 boreholes switched

The Clean Energy Challenge, led by
UNHCR and UNITAR, increased its
membership from 30 to 250 stakeholders
in 2020. Partners and private donors
enabled the first phase of the Energy
Solutions for Displacement Settings
programme to go ahead, improving access
to renewable energy in Ethiopia, Kenya and
Uganda for refugees and host communities.
Initiatives in these countries included
connecting health facilities to photovoltaic
systems, techno-economic feasibility
studies, and mobilization of local actors
to roll out more sustainable energy
programmes. The Renewable Energy for
Refugees (RE4R) programme enabled
the delivery of modern energy services
in Jordan and Rwanda.

Operational highlights
As of December 2020, the RE4R project
had installed solar water heater systems
in 571 shelters and energy efficiency
upgrades in 117 shelters in Jordan.
It upgraded energy efficiency and solar
power systems in 14 schools in Irbid
governorate, and 5,778 students attended
awareness-raising sessions on renewable
energy and energy efficiency principles.

In 2020 UNHCR started applying its
“Global strategy for sustainable energy
2019-2024”, aiming to ensure that energy
needs for cooking, lighting and heating are
safely and sustainably met, supporting
both refugees and host communities.
Cleaner energy sources meant UNHCR’s
operations cut their CO2 emissions by
an estimated 500,000 tons, according to
a revised methodology, far above the
6,000-ton target.

from diesel to hybrid or full solar power.
To the extent possible, health centres and
isolation areas, including six in Bangladesh
and 17 in Uganda, were connected to
photovoltaic systems. COVID-19 also
spurred distance learning, and children
required power and light to study. UNHCR
mobilized funds and resources to provide
sustainable and renewable energy to
health centres and schools in priority
countries.

Training sessions were carried out
for 50 engineers from the Ministry of
Education and 115 youth were given
400 hours of vocational training on
renewable energy. Training topics
included design software packages
(SketchUp, PVSyst and AutoCAD)
and technical knowledge about the
components and installation of solar
power and heating systems.

500,000 tons of
CO2 emissions reduced
by using cleaner sources
of energy. Target: 6,000.
2019 result: 838,220.

Challenges and unmet needs
COVID-19 highlighted the urgency of
increased access to sustainable energy
for displaced populations and host
communities. Nevertheless, sustainable
energy sources such as solar are costly
at their inception. Given limited funding,
operations understandably prioritize
immediate life-saving needs over
technology. Conscious of the substantial
return on investment from reduced costs
over an asset life of 25 years or more,
UNHCR is working to leverage private
sector partnerships to expand the use
of sustainable energy. This is particularly
important in protracted situations where
funding is diminishing and continued
dependency on fuel is no longer
affordable.
The COVID-19 situation and budget
reallocation to other priority activities
hampered environmental protection
programmes, with unmet needs in land
restoration and reforestation activities.

3,000 hectares of

degraded land rehabilitated
through reforestation
activities in refugee-hosting
areas. Target: 5,000.

Refugee families get clean water
thanks to Swedish innovation
In 2020, the Swedish social enterprise
Solvatten made an in-kind donation
of 3,600 portable water treatment and water
heating systems to refugee families in Uganda.
Using solar energy, their innovative product
cleans and heats water within a few hours,
making it safe to drink and use. To address the
water challenges and increase the use of
renewable solar energy in off-grid regions of
Uganda, UNHCR works actively to use Solvatten
technology and educate communities on its
benefits in their field operations.

Results and achievements
In 2020, 250,951 refugees returned to their
country of origin—a decrease of 21% from
2019 (317,291). Despite situations of complex
security and fragile peace, UNHCR
observed self-organized returns by refugees
and IDPs in South Sudan, the Syrian Arab
Republic (Syria), Yemen and elsewhere.
38,000 Syrian refugees returned home,
60% fewer than in 2019, a slowdown after
250,000 returned between 2016 and 2020.
They were assisted by a network of
community centres in Syria, safe public
places where women, men, boys and girls
can meet for social activities and obtain
protection services—ranging from legal aid,
education and livelihood support to
psychosocial support, gender-based
violence prevention and response, and child
protection interventions.
In the Horn of Africa, UNHCR worked with
the Intergovernmental Authority on
Development (IGAD) and members of the
Nairobi Process core group on the activation
of the IGAD Support Platform. Launched at
the Global Refugee Forum, the platform

228 U N H C R G LO B A L R E P O R T 2 02 0

aims to mobilize political, technical and
financial support for refugees, returnees
and host communities.
In 2020, UNHCR strengthened its
collaboration with the UN SecretaryGeneral’s Peacebuilding Fund (PBF),
bolstering its contribution to the Sustaining
Peace and 2030 Agendas. UNHCR
collaborated with the PBF in Burkina Faso,
the Democratic Republic of the Congo and
Sudan in Africa, and El Salvador, Guatemala
and Honduras in Central America. In
Sudan, UNHCR implemented the PBF
supported programme Durable solutions
for forced displacement in West Darfur,
focusing on local action plans, long-term
development and conflict resolution in
target localities. Together with UNDP,
UNHCR provided support to the Sudan
Peace Commission and to the
implementation of the Juba Peace
Agreement pertaining to millions of
Sudanese affected by displacement.
In Colombia, UNHCR signed a memorandum
of understanding with the Victims Unit,
which was set up by a 2011 law to support

Despite the pandemic, 40,774 Burundian
refugees were assisted to return from
Rwanda and the United Republic of
Tanzania, bringing the total number of
Burundian returnees to 120,500 since
voluntary repatriation started in
September 2017. Protection monitoring
activities in return areas in Burundi
showed some progress in returnees’
ability to access services and reintegrate.
More than 90% of interviewed returnees
reported returning to their place of origin,
79% reported having access to primary
health care in their return areas, 82% of
returnee households reported having
access to land and 72% had civil
status documents.
There were 2,311 returns to Afghanistan,
a 73% decline largely due to a suspension
of voluntary repatriation caused by the
pandemic, coupled with the worsening
security situation and a lack of basic
services and economic opportunities.

The Government of Afghanistan committed
to double the number of priority areas for
return and reintegration from 20 to 40.
In 2020, more than 900,000 returnees,
IDPs and community members were
assisted by UNHCR and its partners with
cash assistance and in-kind support,
improved access to shelter, expansion of
education and skills training, implementation
of quick-impact livelihoods projects, and
the development of public infrastructure
including schools and health care facilities.

Challenges and unmet needs
Returns and reintegration efforts were
hampered by the pandemic, with border
closures and public health concerns
preventing voluntary repatriations but also
triggering some premature returns and
onward movements. Returns were also
limited by persistent problems in many
countries of origin, including fragile or
faltering peace processes, continuing
insecurity, exclusion of refugees from
peace processes and repatriation plans,
and a failure to address the original
drivers of displacement.
Other deterrents to voluntary repatriation
included destruction and confiscation
of housing, land and property, severely
overstretched services, and a lack
of employment opportunities in the
home country.

Results and achievements
The pandemic heightened the importance of
resettlement and complementary pathways
as protection and solution mechanisms and
as a solid demonstration of responsibilitysharing. In 2020, the availability of such
solutions decreased and implementation of
the “Three-year strategy (2019-2021) on
resettlement and complementary pathways”
(3YS), which anticipated resettlement of
70,000 people and the admission of
140,000 refugees under complementary
pathways in 2020, suffered a considerable
setback. Despite COVID-19, UNHCR
submitted over 39,500 refugees to
25 countries for resettlement, the majority
originating from the Syrian Arab Republic
(18,220), the Democratic Republic of the
Congo (5,944), Eritrea (2,147), Somalia
(2,071) and Sudan (1,805). 22,800 refugees
departed on resettlement to 22 countries,
64% fewer than in 2019. UNHCR-facilitated
departures were mainly from Lebanon
(4,645), Turkey (4,098), Jordan (1,557),
Egypt (1,353) and the United Republic of
Tanzania (1,341). Half of refugee applicants
were women and girls, and half were
children. Submissions made on an
emergency or urgent basis rose by 38%
from 2019, accounting for a quarter of
global submissions.
To help States and key stakeholders meet
their commitments under the Global
Compact on Refugees and in line with the
3YS, UNHCR and IOM collaborated under
the “Sustainable resettlement and

230 U N H C R G LO B A L R E P O R T 2 02 0

complementary pathways initiative 20202022”, known as the CRISP. The initiative
aims to help States and other key actors
establish or expand third-country solutions
through capacity-building activities.
To advocate for improved access to thirdcountry solutions, UNHCR commissioned
research supported by the CRISP on the
benefits of resettlement and a mapping of
global opportunities to advance resettlement
and complementary pathways.
UNHCR led the creation of the CRISPsupported Global Task Force on Education
Complementary Pathways, launched the
Global Family Reunification Network, and
worked on the creation of the Global
Refugee Labour Mobility Task Force: three
milestones towards achieving the 3YS
goals. All three will be key platforms for
sharing good practice and advocating
for refugees’ increased access to these
solutions. The UNHCR Opportunities
Platform, launched in September 2020
with the support of the CRISP, is a tool
to help refugees find higher education
scholarships, and will expand to include
third-country employment opportunities.
In 2020, the OECD-UNHCR study “Safe
pathways for refugees” was updated with
2019 data. It showed 155,775 first-time
residency permits were issued that year for
study, work and family purposes in OECD
countries and Brazil to nationals of
Afghanistan, Eritrea, the Islamic Republic of
Iran, Iraq, Somalia, the Syrian Arab Republic
and the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela.

The Refugee Steering Group was convened
in January 2020 with representatives from
national, regional and global refugee-led
networks that contributed to the Global
Refugee Forum. It plays an important
advisory role in planning the Annual Tripartite
Consultations on Resettlement, coordinating
refugee participation and creating spaces for
discussions on matters of concern.
As a result of the pandemic, admissions
under complementary pathways in 2020
were limited. The economic slowdown in
many parts of the world affected labour
mobility opportunities and many
scholarship programmes for refugees
have been temporarily halted. While data
in these areas will be provided by the
States later in 2021, the evidence from
partners already suggested that the goal
of 140,000 complementary pathways
admissions in 2020 was not achieved.

and key partners. The project now includes
24 universities and has welcomed around
70 students in three years.
Emergency Transit Mechanisms (ETMs)
provided a life-saving solution, with
533 people of concern in Libya departing for
Niger, Romania and Rwanda. A persistent
challenge was the slow processing and lack
of departures from the ETMs in Niger and
Rwanda to the main resettlement countries,
preventing additional evacuation flights
from Libya taking place.

support of UNHCR, the Italian Ministry of
Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation,

The 2020 target of 70,000 refugees
resettled in 31 countries was not met
due to a shortfall in resettlement quotas,
exacerbated by COVID-19, which led to
the suspension of most departures from
March to June 2020 with only slow and
partial re-openings subsequently. Travel
restrictions also significantly affected
complementary pathways. The pandemic
prompted embassies to suspend visa
services, appointments and new applications,
which particularly affected refugees with
family reunification applications, while
UNHCR strove to coordinate with its
partners to keep the resettlement
programme running and ensure protection
for those most at risk. UNHCR also
encouraged States to be flexible and
innovative with interviews and visa
processing in resettlement and complementary
pathways, including family reunification.

2019 result: 42.

Results and achievements
Local integration of refugees is a complex
and gradual process that involves refugees
establishing themselves and integrating
into the community in a country of asylum.
During the Global Refugee Forum (GRF),
several countries and other entities
pledged to advance and promote local
integration and other local solutions, such
as permitting long-term legal stay and
naturalization, including refugees in labour
markets and education programmes, and
promoting social cohesion. However, in
2020 the pandemic became the overriding
priority.
Civil registration, documentation and legal
stay options for refugees and asylumseekers supported by legal services were a
focus in several countries. UNHCR’s
advocacy, facilitation and support for local

232 U N H C R G LO B A L R E P O R T 2 02 0

integration as a durable solution resulted in
the naturalization of 622 refugees in
Armenia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and
Guinea-Bissau, and the issuance and
renewal of residence permits to
2,051 refugees in Albania, Azerbaijan,
Ghana and Namibia which will enable
holders to legally work in the respective
countries and facilitate access to other
rights. Sociocultural and economic
integration of refugees following
naturalization and granting of long-term
stay in these countries was supported by
counselling; awareness-raising about
rights; cultural education; engaging youth
in community-based activities; legislative
analysis and advice in the context of
employment-related cases; coexistence
projects with development actors,
government, private sector and other
stakeholders; engaging consultants to

Regional platforms such as the Economic
Community of West African States
(ECOWAS); the Economic and Monetary
Community of Central Africa (CEMAC); the
Intergovernmental Authority on Development
(IGAD) support platform under the Nairobi
process; the European Commission; the
Comprehensive Regional Protection and
Solutions Framework (known as MIRPS by
its Spanish acronym) were instrumental in
advancing the integration agenda and
promoting durable solutions including local
integration, leading to the development of
the Sudan and South Sudan durable
solutions initiative, the European Union’s
Action Plan for Integration and Inclusion
2021-2027, as well as the San Salvador city
Declaration to advocate the inclusion of
displaced people and returnees.
A dedicated UNHCR expert on HLP rights
supported operations in Ethiopia, Iraq and
the Philippines, enhancing prospects for
the socioeconomic integration of refugees
through out-of-camp HLP studies, scoping
studies on camp transformation and
HLP training.

Operational highlights
The World Bank IDA18 sub-window
supported the improvement of livelihoods
and basic public services for refugees and
host communities in Niger. This four-year
plan aims to reach a total of 160,000 refugees
through socioeconomic intervention.

In Chad, the out-of-camp approach was
maintained and strengthened, namely by
integrating all potential newly arriving
refugees into host villages, with the
ultimate goal of transforming 30% of
refugee camps into villages by 2024 to
allow for more inclusive socioeconomic
integration.

16 refugee situations

where local integration was
advanced, including as part of
the implementation of pledges
made at the Global Refugee
Forum. Target: 15.

Advances in the legal integration of
refugees included the Democratic
Republic of the Congo’s commitment
at the GRF to offer 10-year residence
permits to the 200,000 Rwandan refugees
who have opted to stay there after
the termination of their status clause.
In preparation, 75,000 Rwandans
were verified.
As a result of UNHCR’s advocacy, Liberia
committed to provide land for agriculture
and permanent housing to 5,000 locally
integrated Ivorian refugees, in line with its
local integration strategy.

Challenges and unmet needs
The COVID-19 pandemic hampered plans
and initiatives as priorities shifted. With
stretched resources, further advancement
of socioeconomic inclusion and legal local
integration was challenging.
In some situations, policy and legal
restrictions prevented legal local
integration from going ahead. The
pandemic significantly affected the number
of advocacy events. More investment was
required to enable UNHCR to advocate
with governments and popularize the
arguments in favour of the local integration
of refugees.

The #IBelong campaign to end statelessness highlighted legislative breakthroughs by
Côte d’Ivoire, the Dominican Republic, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Kenya, North Macedonia,
Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, Uzbekistan and other States. Goodwill Ambassador
Cate Blanchett’s video proved one of the campaign’s most successful products ever.
The campaign highlighted how people without a legal identity were at extra risk in the
pandemic and needed to be included in national COVID-19 responses.
UNHCR’s highly committed group of Goodwill Ambassadors, high profile supporters
and digital influencers, with extensive audience reach despite COVID-19, created
opportunities for advocacy and fundraising partnerships and brought authentic refugee
voices and emergency appeals directly to the public. Their support for key UNHCR
priorities included COVID-19 messages, emergency appeals and virtual participation
in World Refugee Day, the #IBelong campaign and the first ever online Nansen
ceremony. Goodwill Ambassadors led virtual discussions, e-gaming tournaments, poetry
crowdsourcing, art contests, online concerts, music videos, comedy events and more.
Some of UNHCR’s most in-demand Goodwill Ambassadors include refugees whose
lived experience brings power and authenticity to their advocacy. Together with high
profile supporters, they helped raise millions of dollars and generated thousands of
news items. Their reach of more than 177 million followers brought UNHCR record social
media engagement.

The WRD 2020 emoji was
created by O’Plérou,
a designer and refugee
advocate from Côte d’Ivoire, in
partnership with Twitter.

55.2

million combined
followers of the #WithRefugee
Coalition were reached by
social media posts on
WRD celebrations.

UNHCR generates public support for refugees, IDPs and stateless people and provides
them with opportunities to speak out. It counters xenophobia and divisive rhetoric about
refugees, displaced people, and asylum seekers, in line with the UN Strategy and Plan of
Action on Hate Speech. UNHCR engages in campaigns and events that are endorsed by
a diverse corps of Goodwill Ambassadors and high-profile supporters, amplifying its
messaging around the world.
Inspired by the battle against COVID-19 and worldwide demonstrations for racial justice,
UNHCR’s World Refugee Day (WRD) theme, “Every action counts, everyone can make a
difference”, served as a call for equality. Videos and stories featured refugees fighting
the pandemic and the organization’s determination to stay the course despite the added
burden of COVID-19. Most events were held virtually and many were highlighted,
including those held by partners, on UNHCR’s Global Website.
On WRD, the #WithRefugees coalition—backed by faith-based organizations,
businesses, universities, NGOs, private sector partners and over 200 cities—sent a
message of inclusion with a positive narrative about refugees in communities, helping
UNHCR mobilize new audiences. Faith-based members acknowledged their special
responsibility to tackle xenophobia. More than 800 people registered for a joint UNHCRCouncil of Europe webinar marking WRD, “Creating inclusive cities: everyone can make
a difference”.

The Nansen Refugee Award has a
rich legacy. Since 1954, more than
60 individuals and organizations have
been recognized for improving the lives
and communities of forcibly displaced
people. The award ceremony is a UNHCR
signature event. In 2020, UNHCR
honoured Mayerlín Vergara Pérez, a
human rights activist and the regional
coordinator for Fundación Renacer in Colombia. Ms. Pérez has worked to end the sexual exploitation of
children and adolescents, many of whom are refugees in Colombia. The prize of $150,000 awarded to
Ms. Pérez was jointly donated by the Swiss and Norwegian Governments.
Four regional winners received a Nansen certificate:
·	 Ms. Sabuni Francoise Chikunda, a refugee teacher and founder of The Women’s Centre, which helps
victims of sexual and gender-based violence in Uganda.
·	 Ms. Rozma Ghafouri, an Afghan refugee in the Islamic Republic of Iran who taught sports to help
refugee children get off the streets and into school.
·	 Ms. Tetiana Barantsova, human rights activist and co-founder of AMI-Skhid, an NGO advocating
for the protection of IDPs with disabilities in Ukraine.
·	 Dr. Rana Dajani, a scientist and founder of the “We love reading” project, which makes reading
and learning accessible to refugee children.

EXCOM MEMBERS
AND PARTIES TO CONVENTIONS

ANNEXES
MEMBERS OF UNHCR’s EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE
AND STATES PARTIES TO THE REFUGEE AND
STATELESSNESS CONVENTIONS
UNHCR is governed by the United Nations General Assembly and the Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC). In 1958,
ECOSOC established the Executive Committee of the High Commissioner’s Programme (ExCom), pursuant to a resolution
of the General Assembly. Its main tasks are to approve the High Commissioner’s programmes, advise the High
Commissioner in the exercise of his functions (mainly on protection issues), and oversee the Office’s finances and
administration.
ExCom holds an annual session in Geneva every October. The 71st session took place from 5 to 9 October 2020. Meetings
of the Executive Committee’s Standing Committee are held at various dates throughout the year to carry on the work
between plenary sessions.
ExCom membership is on the widest possible geographical basis from those States (Members of the United Nations) with
a demonstrated interest in, and devotion to, the solution of refugee problems. By the end of 2020, there were 106 ExCom
members in the following table–in blue–which also shows the States parties to the 1951 Convention relating to the Status
of Refugees and its Protocol of 1967 and to the 1954 Convention relating to the Status of Stateless Persons and the 1961
Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness.
