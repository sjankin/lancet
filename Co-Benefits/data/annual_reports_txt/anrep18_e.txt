Rob er to A z evêdo
There is great value in the multilateral trading system. It has
secured a foundation on which WTO members can base their
economic planning with confidence. Imagine, however, if we were
suddenly presented with a scenario where the system started to
falter. If tariffs were no longer bound at the historically low levels
we see today, if we could not rely on members honouring their
services commitments, or if the system of settling trade disputes
was to erode, the consequences would be dramatic. It is therefore
in the interests of all WTO members – developed, developing and
least-developed – that we should remember the importance of the
system for our economies and recognise the need to preserve and
strengthen it for future generations. This is particularly important at
a time of rising trade tensions among some major trading partners.
Trade growth in 2017 was the strongest
since 2011. With continued robust
growth forecast for this year and next,
we are seeing trade playing its part in
supporting the global economic recovery
– supporting GDP growth, development
and job creation around the world. If we
are to avoid this strong performance
being compromised by a further
escalation in tensions, we must seek to
further enhance global cooperation.
The WTO, which was created as a forum
for members to find ways to cooperate
and hold each other to account, will play
its proper role in this process. Indeed,
we have done so before. It can be
argued that without the WTO, a wave of
protectionist measures would have been
stirred up by the 2008 crisis, significantly
worsening the economic effects of that
downturn. We will continue working
to ease tensions and to promote
cooperation and restraint.
For the trading system to keep playing its
essential role, it must also be continually
strengthened and improved so that it
can meet the demands of a rapidly
changing and evolving global economy.
WTO members took a number of historic
steps in this direction in early 2017
with the implementation of two important
reforms to global trade rules: the Trade
Facilitation Agreement, which will speed

World Trade Organization  Annual Report 2018

the flow of goods across borders and
potentially reduce trade costs by over
14 per cent, and an amendment to the
WTO’s intellectual property agreement,
which will expedite poorer countries’
access to affordable medicines
which they lack the capacity to
produce themselves.
Implementation of these changes
to the global trade rulebook will be
closely monitored by the WTO’s relevant
committees, which provide an important
forum for WTO members to raise trade
concerns and propose solutions.
The WTO’s committees were extremely
active in 2017, discussing issues ranging
from the use of subsidies to members’
latest anti-dumping actions.
One of the main aims of the committees
is to resolve trade concerns in a
consensual way, thus avoiding the need
to pursue these concerns more formally
through the WTO’s dispute settlement
system. We strongly encourage amicable
settlement among WTO members where
possible. Since its establishment, more
than half of all disputes lodged with
the WTO have been settled in this way
without the need for creating a dispute
panel. Where it proves impossible for
members to resolve trade differences,
our dispute settlement system provides
the legal framework for finding a solution.

Message from Director‑General Roberto Azevêdo
www.wto.org/dg

-----------------------Page 10 End-----------------------

We need to continue
strengthening the WTO,
fostering cooperation on
global economic issues
and making the case for
the rules-based system.
I will continue working
together with all WTO
members to that end.

The system is one of the most active
adjudicatory systems in the world and
operates at a faster rate than other
international bodies.

issues, from agriculture to development,
to the linkages between trade and the
environment. This work is continuing
in Geneva in 2018.

The number of active disputes increased
significantly in 2017. Members’ regular
use of the system is a clear indication
of its effectiveness. To deal with the
growing demand, we have reallocated
resources to the divisions dealing with
these cases and we continue to consult
with members on ways of improving
the efficiency of dispute proceedings.
A properly functioning system requires
full capacity in all areas, including the
Appellate Body. However, there is
currently an impasse in the process
of appointing new Appellate Body
members. Finding a solution here is
a systemic priority.

The needs of the poorest members
remain central to the work of the
WTO – in our negotiations and
beyond. We provide regular training
opportunities for government officials
from developing and least-developed
members, reaching around 18,500
people in 2017. In addition, the WTO’s
Aid for Trade initiative makes a real
difference in supporting countries
to benefit from the trading system.
Over $340 billion has been disbursed
under the Aid for Trade umbrella during
its first ten years. This includes targeted
programmes, such as the Enhanced
Integrated Framework, which provides
technical and financial support to
least-developed countries to help them
use trade as a tool for economic growth
and poverty reduction.

2017 culminated with our Ministerial
Conference in Buenos Aires, which
attracted over 4,000 participants.
Members actively discussed a wide
range of issues, continuing the
negotiations pursued in Geneva in the
months leading up to the conference.
Agreement could not be reached in
many of the areas under discussion
but a number of important steps were
taken, including the ministerial decision
on fisheries subsidies which commits
members to establishing new disciplines
in this area by the next Ministerial
Conference in 2019.
In addition, the conference concluded
with over 120 WTO members endorsing
the Buenos Aires Declaration on Trade
and Women’s Economic Empowerment,
which sends an important message
about the WTO’s efforts to make trade
more inclusive. The conference also
witnessed the signing of joint statements
by groups of like-minded members to
pursue discussions on e-commerce,
investment facilitation for development
and micro, small and medium-sized
enterprises. It is very positive that
members are seeking to use the WTO
to tackle matters that they consider to
be of pressing economic importance.
As they move ahead, I have urged the
proponents of these issues to engage
with the full membership and to keep
their discussions as open, transparent
and inclusive as possible.
I also endorse the closing remarks of
the Chair of the Ministerial Conference,
Susana Malcorra, who noted the
commitment of WTO members to
advance negotiations in all remaining

Message from Director‑General Roberto Azevêdo
www.wto.org/dg
	

This essential work will play a key role in
delivering the Sustainable Development
Goals (SDGs). Indeed, many of the
topics under discussion at the WTO
will be important here, and we have
already made real progress. For example,
the decision taken by WTO members
in 2015 to abolish agricultural export
subsidies delivered a key target of
SDG 2 on “zero hunger”. In addition,
by agreeing to act on harmful fisheries
subsidies by 2019, members have also
committed to meet an important target
of SDG 14. In these, and many other
ways, trade has the power to make a real,
lasting, positive impact on people’s lives.
I believe that the multilateral trading
system can continue to be a force for
good in the world – promoting stability,
creating opportunities, and boosting
growth and development, as it has done
for many years. But we can take nothing
for granted. For all of this to happen,
we need to continue strengthening the
WTO, fostering cooperation on global
economic issues and making the case
for the rules-based system. I will continue
working together with all WTO members
to that end.

Introduction

Under s ta nd i ng
t he WTO
There are a number of ways of looking at the World Trade
Organization. It is an organization for trade-opening. It is
a forum for governments to negotiate trade agreements.
It is a place for them to settle trade disputes. It operates
the global system of trade rules. It helps developing
countries build their trade capacity. Essentially, the WTO
is a place where member governments try to sort out the
trade problems they face with each other.

W ho
we a re

The WTO was born out of negotiations
aimed at progressively reducing
obstacles to trade. Where countries
have faced trade barriers and wanted
them lowered, the negotiations have
helped to open markets for trade. But the
WTO is not just about opening markets,
and in some circumstances its rules
support maintaining trade barriers – for
example, to protect consumers and the
environment or prevent the spread
of disease.

At its heart are the WTO agreements,
negotiated and signed by the bulk
of the world’s trading nations.
These documents provide the rules
for international commerce. They
are essentially contracts, binding
governments to keep their trade policies
within agreed limits. Although negotiated
and signed by governments, the goal
is to help producers of goods and
services, exporters, and importers
conduct their business, while allowing
governments to meet social and
environmental objectives.
	

10

World Trade Organization  Annual Report 2018

The system’s overriding purpose is to help
trade flow as freely as possible – so long
as there are no undesirable side effects –
because this is important for stimulating
economic growth and employment and
supporting the integration of developing
countries into the international trading
system. That partly means removing
obstacles. It also means ensuring that
individuals, companies and governments
know what the trade rules are around the
world, and giving them the confidence
that there will be no sudden changes of
policy. In other words, the rules have to be
“transparent” and predictable.

Trade relations often involve conflicting
interests. Agreements, including those
painstakingly negotiated in the WTO
system, often need interpreting.
The most harmonious way to settle
these differences is through a neutral
procedure based on an agreed legal
foundation. That is the purpose behind
the dispute settlement process written
into the WTO agreements.

W hat we
s ta nd for
The WTO agreements are lengthy and
complex because they are legal texts
covering a wide range of activities. But a
number of simple, fundamental principles
run throughout all of these documents.
These principles are the foundation of the
multilateral trading system.

Message from Director‑General Roberto Azevêdo
www.wto.org/dg

Non-discrimination
A country should not discriminate
between its trading partners and it should
not discriminate between its own and
foreign products, services or nationals.

More open
Lowering trade barriers is one of the most
obvious ways of encouraging trade; these
barriers include customs duties (or tariffs)
and measures such as import bans or
quotas that restrict quantities selectively.

Predictable
and transparent

1

Foreign companies, investors and
governments should be confident that
trade barriers should not be raised
arbitrarily. With stability and predictability,
investment is encouraged, jobs are
created and consumers can fully enjoy
the benefits of competition – such as
increased choice and lower prices.

More competitive
Discouraging “unfair” practices, such as
export subsidies and dumping products at
below normal value to gain market share;
the issues are complex, and the rules try
to establish what is fair or unfair, and how
governments can respond, in particular
by charging additional import duties
calculated to compensate for damage
caused by unfair trade.

More beneficial for less
developed countries
Giving them more time to adjust, greater
flexibility and special privileges; over
three-quarters of WTO members are
developing countries and countries in
transition to market economies. The
WTO agreements give them transition
periods to adjust to WTO provisions
and, in the case of the Trade Facilitation
Agreement, provide for practical support
for implementation of the Agreement.

Protect the environment
The WTO’s agreements permit members
to take measures to protect not only
the environment but also public health,
animal health and plant health. However,
these measures must be applied in the
same way to both national and foreign
businesses. In other words, members
must not use environmental protection
measures as a means of introducing a
trade barrier.

164
The WTO is run by its
164 member governments.

•	 The WTO is run by its member governments.
All major decisions are made by the membership
as a whole, either by ministers (who usually meet
at least once every two years) or by their ambassadors
or delegates (who meet regularly in Geneva).
•	 While the WTO is driven by its member states,
it could not function without its Secretariat to
coordinate the activities.
•	 The Secretariat employs over 600 staff, and its experts –
lawyers, economists, statisticians and communications
experts – assist WTO members on a daily basis to ensure,
among other things, that negotiations progress smoothly,
and that the rules of international trade are correctly
applied and enforced.

-----------------------Page 14 End-----------------------

Trade negotiations
The WTO agreements cover goods, services and intellectual
property. They spell out the principles of liberalization,
and the permitted exceptions. They include individual countries’
commitments to lower customs tariffs and other trade barriers,
and to open services markets. They set procedures for settling
disputes. These agreements are not static; they are renegotiated
from time to time and new agreements can be added, as was
the case at the Bali and Nairobi ministerial conferences of 2013
and 2015.
Although at the end of the 2017 Ministerial Conference held in
Buenos Aires the Conference Chair, Minister Susana Malcorra
of Argentina, acknowledged that differences remain regarding
the Doha Round and the Doha Development Agenda, she also
highlighted the decisions taken by ministers and noted that
“members agreed to advance negotiations on all remaining
issues, including on the three pillars of agriculture – namely
domestic support, market access and export competition – as
well as non-agricultural market access, services, development,
TRIPS, rules, and trade and environment”.

Implementation and monitoring
WTO agreements require governments to make their trade
policies transparent by notifying the WTO about laws in force
and measures adopted. Various WTO councils and committees
seek to ensure that these requirements are being followed and
that WTO agreements are being properly implemented. All WTO
members must undergo periodic scrutiny of their trade policies
and practices, each review containing reports by the country
concerned and the WTO Secretariat.

Dispute settlement
The WTO’s procedure for resolving trade disputes under the
Dispute Settlement Understanding is vital for enforcing the rules
and therefore for ensuring that trade flows smoothly. Countries
bring disputes to the WTO if they think their rights under the
agreements are being infringed. Judgements by specially
appointed independent experts are based on interpretations
of the agreements and individual countries’ commitments.

Supporting development
and building trade capacity
WTO agreements contain special provision for developing
countries, including longer time periods to implement
agreements and commitments, measures to increase their trading
opportunities, and support to help them build their trade capacity,
to handle disputes and to implement technical standards.
The WTO organizes hundreds of technical cooperation missions
to developing countries annually. It also holds numerous courses
each year in Geneva for government officials. The Aid for Trade
initiative aims to help developing countries develop the skills and
infrastructure needed to expand their trade.

Outreach
The WTO maintains regular dialogue with the business
community, non-governmental organizations, parliamentarians,
other international organizations, the media and the general
public on various aspects of the WTO and its negotiations,
with the aim of enhancing cooperation and increasing
awareness of WTO activities.

and d i s cu s s ion s
Trade negotiations in 2017 culminated at the
11th Ministerial Conference (MC11) in Buenos Aires
in December with a decision on fisheries subsidies
and decisions in a number of other areas.

MC11 Chair Susana
Malcorra noted
that WTO members
were committed
to advancing
WTO work in all
negotiating areas.

During the year, WTO members worked
hard to advance trade negotiations ahead
of MC11, with discussions focusing on
agriculture, fisheries subsidies, services
and special and differential treatment
for developing countries. A number of
papers and submissions were presented,
which helped focus and advance the
negotiations. However, despite a high
level of engagement, WTO members’
positions did not converge sufficiently.
The Chair of the Trade Negotiations
Committee, Director-General Roberto
Azevêdo, said in late November that
at that stage he did not see agreed
negotiated outcomes for members to
present to ministers at MC11.
At MC11, five “minister facilitators”
worked with the negotiating group
chairs to try to narrow differences in
the areas under discussion, including
agriculture, fisheries subsidies,
development, e-commerce, domestic
regulation in services, and transparency
in non-agricultural market access.
The facilitators reported regularly to the
full membership, following the principles
of transparency and inclusiveness.

ended with a ministerial decision to
continue with negotiations on fisheries
subsidies, with the aim of reaching
an agreement by the Ministerial
Conference in 2019. Ministers also took
decisions regarding e-commerce, the
Work Programme on Small Economies,
and “non-violation and situation”
complaints in intellectual property.
In addition, the MC11 Chair, Susana
Malcorra, noted that WTO members
were committed to advancing WTO
work in all negotiating areas.
At the end of the Conference, four joint
statements by like-minded groups of
members were signed on advancing
discussions on e-commerce, investment
facilitation for development, micro, small
and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs),
and trade and women’s economic
empowerment. In addition, a group
of WTO members issued a joint
statement reaffirming their commitment
to advancing the ongoing talks on
domestic regulation in services.
See pages 42-59.

In the end, agreement could not be
reached in many of the areas under
discussion. However, the conference

The WTO’s landmark Trade Facilitation Agreement entered
into force in early 2017, as did an amendment to the WTO’s
Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual
Property Rights (TRIPS), easing developing countries’
access to medicines. Director-General Roberto Azevêdo
began a second term of office.

The Trade
Facilitation
Agreement entered
into force on 22
February 2017.
The Agreement is
expected to reduce
trade costs globally
by an average
of over

14%

WTO members agreed by consensus to
appoint Roberto Azevêdo for a second
four-year term as Director-General,
beginning on 1 September 2017.
He was the only candidate nominated
for the post when the process closed
on 31 December 2016.
Xavier Carim (South Africa), Chair of the
General Council – the WTO’s highestlevel decision-making body in Geneva
– oversaw preparations for the 11th
Ministerial Conference (MC11), held
in Buenos Aires in December.
The Conference ended with ministers
adopting decisions on fisheries
subsidies, e-commerce, small economies
and intellectual property and establishing
a working party on the accession of
South Sudan. Substantive progress
was not possible in other areas under
discussion but the MC11 Chair noted
that WTO members agreed to advance
negotiations on all remaining issues.

The protocol amending the TRIPS
Agreement entered into force on
23 January 2017 upon its acceptance
by two-thirds of the WTO membership.
The protocol eases poorer WTO
members’ access to medicines by
allowing generic versions of patented
medicines to be produced under
compulsory licences for export to
countries that cannot manufacture
the medicines for themselves.
The Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA)
entered into force on 22 February 2017
after acceptances of the required twothirds of WTO members were received.
By speeding up the movement of goods
across borders, the Agreement is
expected to reduce trade costs globally
by an average of over 14 per cent.
The TFA Committee started work
under its first chair.
See pages 60-125.

During the year, the General Council
regularly reviewed progress in
implementing decisions taken at the
two previous ministerial conferences,
in 2013 and in 2015. In particular,
the Chair regularly reported on the
implementation of the Nairobi Decision
on Export Competition, which commits
WTO members to eliminating agricultural
export subsidies.

D i spute s et t lement
Dispute settlement activity intensified in 2017, as the
monthly average of panels, appellate and arbitration
proceedings dealt with rose by 20 per cent.
The number of active disputes increased
significantly compared with 2016,
extending the trend of recent years.
Due to the increase in dispute settlement
activity, 29 WTO posts have been
redeployed to the legal divisions over
the past two to three years.

Body on 1 August 2017. The remaining
members of the Appellate Body are
Ujal Singh Bhatia (India), Thomas R.
Graham (United States), Shree Baboo
Chekitan Servansing (Mauritius) and
Hong Zhao (China).
Appellate Body Chair Ujal Singh
Bhatia alerted WTO members in June
2017 that the Appellate Body faces
challenges as it deals with increasing
demand for its services and increasingly
complex disputes. He highlighted that
the increasing number of appeals
means the Appellate Body is facing
difficulty in meeting the requirement of
“prompt” resolution of disputes, a feature
that distinguishes the WTO dispute
settlement system from other international
adjudicative systems. He reminded
WTO members that the WTO’s dispute
settlement system should not be taken
for granted and that it required “nurturing
through timely interventions when
problem areas emerge”.

WTO members continue to be very
active in dispute settlement, and the
subject matter of disputes brought to the
WTO continues to span a wide range
of agreements. As in previous years,
both developed and developing country
members have been involved in the
dispute settlement mechanism, both as
complainants and as respondents. During
2017, WTO members filed 17 requests
for consultations, the first step in the
dispute settlement system, compared
with 16 in 2016 and 13 in 2015. Canada,
Qatar and the United States filed the
most disputes in 2017, with three each,
followed by Russia and Ukraine with two.

Due to the increase
in dispute settlement
activity, 29 WTO
posts have been
redeployed to the
legal divisions
over the past two
to three years.

WTO members remained divided at the
end of 2017 on the selection process
for choosing three new members of the
seven-strong Appellate Body to replace
Ricardo Ramírez Hernández of Mexico
and Peter Van den Bossche of Belgium,
who completed their second terms of
office in 2017, and Hyun Chong Kim of
Korea, who resigned from the Appellate

Eight appeal proceedings were
initiated by WTO members in 2017,
the same number as in 2015 and
2016. Six Appellate Body reports
were circulated during the year,
the same total as the previous year.

Support for developing countries and building trade
capacity continued to be a central focus of the WTO’s
activities in 2017, with the Committee on Trade and
Development acting as the main forum for discussions.

At a meeting of the Committee on
Trade and Development in November,
the WTO Secretariat reported that the
share of developing economies and
least-developed countries (LDCs) in
world merchandise trade contracted in
2016. The LDCs expressed concern that
they were far from achieving the target
of doubling their share in world exports
by 2020 as envisaged under the United
Nations Sustainable Development Goals
(SDGs). They called on WTO members
to increase their efforts in implementing
ministerial decisions taken in favour
of LDCs.

In July 2017, the WTO
hosted the Global
Review of Aid for
Trade, attracting
some 1,500
attendees.

In July 2017, the WTO hosted the
Global Review of Aid for Trade on the
theme “Promoting Trade, Inclusiveness
and Connectivity for Sustainable
Development”. Some 1,500 trade and
development professionals attended
the conference, which underlined the
important part played by trade – and the
key role of Aid for Trade – in delivering
growth, reducing poverty and achieving
the SDGs. Aid for Trade disbursements
amounted to US$ 38.8 billion in 2016,
taking the 2006-16 total to over
US$ 342 billion.
Trade’s role in promoting sustainable
development was an important topic
at the WTO’s annual Public Forum in
Geneva. Both governments and the
private sector need to be more active
in ensuring trade’s full potential in
contributing to SDGs, the Forum heard.

	

28

World Trade Organization  Annual Report 2018

The Enhanced Integrated Framework,
a multi-agency initiative, accelerated its
activities, approving 23 new projects
to help LDCs use trade as a tool for
growth. In 2017, the Standards and
Trade Development Facility, a global
partnership, allocated USD 4.2 million
to help developing countries meet
international standards for food safety,
plant and animal health and to access
global markets.
In 2017, the WTO undertook 350
technical assistance activities, including
e-learning, global and regional training
courses, academic programmes and
national and regional workshops,
aimed at giving government officials
from developing countries a better
understanding of WTO agreements.
Approximately 18,500 participants
undertook technical assistance
activities during the year.
The Young Professionals Programme,
aimed at increasing the representation
of professionals from developing
countries under-represented at the
WTO, was launched in 2017 with five
participants, expanding to 15 in 2018.

Out reach
The WTO’s outreach programme in 2017 included a number
of initiatives aimed at the business community, civil society,
academia and the general public.

WTO interaction with the business
sector increased in 2017. In July, two
focus groups of business leaders,
established under the WTO’s
Trade Dialogues initiative, issued
recommendations on business priorities
for the WTO. In August, the WTO and
the International Chamber of Commerce
(ICC) launched the Small Business
Champions initiative, which aims to
help micro, small and medium-sized
enterprises participate more fully in
global trade.
In December, a business forum took
place for the first time on the sidelines of
the 11th Ministerial Conference (MC11)
in Buenos Aires. At the end of the
Forum, the ICC issued a statement with
recommendations on the direction of
the world trade agenda.

In August, the
WTO and the ICC
launched the Small
Business Champions
initiative to help
SMEs participate
more fully in
global trade.

The WTO continued to collaborate
with other international organizations,
participating in high-level meetings
and producing co-publications. In July,
Director-General Roberto Azevêdo
attended the G20 summit in Hamburg,
Germany. In a joint statement issued
ahead of the summit, DG Azevêdo and
the heads of the International Monetary
Fund and the World Bank stressed
that the economic well-being of billions

	

30

World Trade Organization  Annual Report 2018

depends on trade and that deeper trade
integration coupled with supportive
domestic policies can help boost
incomes and economic growth.
The WTO’s major outreach event of
the year was the Public Forum. Held
in September, it attracted over 1,200
participants from 112 countries. Under
the theme “Trade: Behind the Headlines”,
the Forum hosted 105 sessions.
The Parliamentary Conference on the
WTO, which met in Buenos Aires,
just before MC11, urged WTO members
to make every effort to strengthen the
multilateral trading system, with the
WTO as its cornerstone.
In 2017, the WTO website was
redesigned to give it a fresh look and
to make it more accessible to a variety
of devices. The website attracted
almost 1.9 million visits a month while
ever greater numbers followed the
WTO’s Twitter, Facebook and Weibo
accounts. WTO videos were watched
over 700,000 times on social media
and the WTO’s publications programme
produced over 60 publications,
many in collaboration with other
international organizations.

Bueno s Ai re s
M i n i s ter ial
C onferenc e
At the 11th WTO Ministerial Conference (MC11), held in
Buenos Aires on 10-13 December 2017, ministers adopted
decisions on fisheries subsidies, e-commerce, small
economies and intellectual property and established
a working party on the accession of South Sudan.
Substantive progress was not possible in other areas
under discussion. The MC11 Chair noted that WTO
members agreed to advance negotiations on all
remaining issues.

The opening ceremony saw a strong
show of political support for the WTO
and the multilateral trading system.
The presidents of Argentina, Brazil,
Paraguay and Uruguay emphasized the
role of trade in growth and development
and the importance of promoting a more
inclusive multilateral trading system.
The President of Chile addressed the
conference in a video message.
The four presidents, together with
representatives of Chile, Colombia,
Guyana, Mexico, Peru and Suriname,
signed a presidential declaration
reaffirming their support for
multilateralism and the importance
of preserving and strengthening the
multilateral trading system. They invited
other members wishing to join the
declaration to do so.
In Buenos Aires, informal meetings
open to all WTO members were held
in a number of areas in parallel to the
formal plenary sessions. Members, with
the help of five ministerial facilitators
(see page 45), worked hard to try to
narrow their differences. In the end,
agreement could not be reached in many
of the areas under discussion but the
conference ended with a decision on
fisheries subsidies and on a number of
other areas (see box).

Ministerial decisions
Fisheries subsidies
Ministers agreed on a work programme, with a view to adopting an
agreement on fisheries subsidies disciplines by the next Ministerial
Conference in 2019 (see page 57).
E-commerce
Ministers agreed to seek to “reinvigorate” work under the 1998 E-commerce
Work Programme and extended the moratorium on customs duties on
electronic transmissions until the next Ministerial Conference (see page 63).
TRIPS non-violation and situation complaints
Ministers agreed to extend the moratorium on “non-violation and situation”
complaints in intellectual property until the next Ministerial Conference.
They directed the TRIPS Council to continue its examination of the scope
and modalities for these complaints and to make recommendations to the
next Conference (see page 102).
Work Programme on Small Economies
Ministers reaffirmed their commitment to the Work Programme and
instructed the WTO Secretariat to continue its work on the challenges
that small economies experience in their efforts to reduce trade costs
(see page 150).
South Sudan
Ministers agreed to start WTO membership talks for South Sudan
and established a working party to examine the country’s application
(see page 36).

Next steps
At the closing session, the MC11 Chair,
Minister Susana Malcorra of Argentina,
noted the strong commitment to
“advance negotiations on all remaining
issues, including on the three pillars of
agriculture – namely domestic support,
market access and export competition
– as well as non-agricultural market
access, services, development, TRIPS,
rules, and trade and environment”.
Director-General Azevêdo said that in
Buenos Aires, members had sowed the
seed of an organization which could
work better – an organization that could
be vibrant, flexible and nimble. But for
that to happen, all of them had to believe
in that vision.

Joint statements
by groups of members
At the end of the Conference, four joint
statements were signed by like-minded
groups of members on advancing
discussions on e-commerce, investment
facilitation for development, micro, small
and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs),
and trade and women’s economic
empowerment. These members
encouraged all WTO members to
join them.

Seventy-one members agreed to initiate
exploratory work together towards future
negotiations on trade-related aspects
of e-commerce. Participation would
be open to all WTO members and would
be without prejudice to participants’
positions on future negotiations. A first
meeting was held in the first quarter
of 2018.
Recognizing the links between
investment, trade and development,
70 WTO members agreed to pursue
structured discussions aimed at
developing a multilateral framework on
investment facilitation. The proponents
met in early 2018.
On MSMEs, 87 WTO members declared
their intention to create an Informal
Working Group on MSMEs at the WTO
that is open to all members. They agreed
to continue striving for a multilateral
outcome aimed at establishing a formal
work programme for MSMEs at the next
Ministerial Conference. The discussions
will address the obstacles MSMEs face
in participating in international trade.

In addition, a group of 60 WTO
members issued a joint statement
reaffirming their commitment to
advancing the ongoing talks on domestic
regulation in services and calling on all
members to intensify work, with the aim
of concluding the negotiations before
the next Ministerial Conference.

Side events
A Business Forum organized on
the sidelines of MC11 ended
with the International Chamber of
Commerce issuing a statement with
recommendations on the direction of
the world trade agenda (see page 174).
To drive dialogue on e-commerce,
a new initiative was launched by the
WTO, the World Economic Forum and
the Electronic World Trade Platform
(see page 175).

Attendance
The Ministerial Conference, the first to
be held in South America, was attended
by about 4,500 participants.

A total of 118 WTO members and
observers supported the Buenos Aires
Declaration on Trade and Women’s
Economic Empowerment aimed at
increasing the participation of women
in trade (see page 108).

22

A total of 22 countries
are currently seeking
to join the WTO.

Background on
joining the WTO
The WTO is open to states
or customs territories with full
autonomy over their external
commercial relations. To join the
WTO, a government has to bring
its economic and trade policies
into line with WTO rules and
principles and negotiate with the
WTO membership on guaranteed
minimum levels of access to their
domestic markets for goods and
services. The WTO accession
process promotes the integration
of new members into the global
economy. In return, acceding
economies undertake to liberalize
their trade regimes.

An accession process begins when
the WTO membership accepts an
application from a government and
establishes a working party. The process
concludes when the WTO membership
and the acceding government both
accept a negotiated accession package
(see background below). The length of
accession processes varies depending
on the negotiating commitment of the
acceding economy, the degree to
which its trade rules are already
WTO-consistent and the complexity
of the negotiations.
Since the WTO was launched in
1995, 36 members have joined the
organization. Twenty-two states or
separate customs territories are
currently seeking to join.

South Sudan
On 13 December 2017, the 11th
Ministerial Conference (MC11) in
Buenos Aires approved South Sudan’s
request to accede to the WTO and
established the Working Party on the
Accession of South Sudan to examine
the application.
Speaking at the close of MC11,
Ambassador Akech Chol Ahou Ayok,
Deputy Permanent Representative
of South Sudan in Geneva, said
acceptance of South Sudan’s application
marked a “historical moment”. South
Sudan is fully committed to undertaking

	

36

World Trade Organization  Annual Report 2018

the reforms required by WTO accession
in accordance with the principles of
the rule of law, transparency, good
governance and respect for human
rights, he said.
South Sudan is a least-developed
country (LDC) and the world’s newest
nation, gaining independence in 2011.
It has a population of approximately 13
million, the great majority of which live in
rural areas and engage in subsistence
agriculture. Since independence, it has
embarked on new trade, monetary and
fiscal policies aimed at accelerating its
economic recovery and growth after a
civil war lasting almost 22 years.
The country is young, with approximately
two-thirds of the population under 30.
South Sudan has been a member of the
East African Community since 2016.

Comoros
The accession process of the Union
of the Comoros accelerated in 2017.
The Indian Ocean state is now
approaching the final stages prior to
WTO membership. The working party
met twice, with members welcoming the
substantive work done. But they noted
that some issues will require further
work to bring the country’s foreign trade
regime and its legislative framework
into full conformity with WTO rules
and requirements.

Bosnia and Herzegovina
The government of Bosnia and
Herzegovina has completed outstanding
accession-related legislative reforms
and only a few negotiating issues
remain. At a meeting of the Working
Party on the Accession of Bosnia and
Herzegovina, held on 7 February 2018,
Chair Atanas Paparizov of Bulgaria said:
“This accession has reached technical
maturity and it is ready for conclusion in
the coming months.”

Only a few negotiating
issues remain
for Bosnia and
Herzegovina’s WTO
membership talks.

If agreement can be reached on the
remaining issues, the next working party
meeting could be the last one, paving the
way for the adoption of the accession
package by the General Council before
the summer break, he said. The working
party was established on 15 July 1999.

Belarus
The working party met twice in 2017,
resuming formal activity after a 12-year
pause. WTO members welcomed the
active engagement of Belarus in its
efforts to become a member of the
organization and expressed readiness
to maintain the positive momentum.

Iraq
Iraq held its first working party meeting
since 2008 and declared its intention
to resume substantive accession
negotiations with members in the near
term. The chair of the working party,
Ambassador Omar Hilale of Morocco,
said he was encouraged by the
political commitment demonstrated by
the Government of Iraq to resume its

	

38

World Trade Organization  Annual Report 2018

accession process and the technical
progress being made.

Sudan
Sudan’s working party met twice
during the year – its first meetings
since 2004. Members commended
the positive momentum for Sudan’s
WTO membership negotiations and
reiterated their readiness to support
the process. Negotiations resumed in
January 2017 after 13 years of impasse.
The working party has acknowledged
the considerable advance in Sudan’s
technical work. Sudan urged members
to provide the necessary technical
assistance to expedite negotiations.

Somalia and Timor-Leste
Somalia and Timor-Leste activated their
accession processes following the
establishment of their accession working
parties in December 2016. Timor-Leste
circulated its first multilateral negotiating
inputs to members and Somalia is
expected to do so shortly.

The Lebanese Republic
and Azerbaijan
The Lebanese Republic circulated
a comprehensive set of multilateral
documentation to its working party
after eight years of inactivity. Azerbaijan
was urged to step up bilateral talks
with WTO members on market access
commitments for goods and services
to accelerate its efforts to secure
membership, which it originally applied
for in 1997.

Technical assistance
and outreach
Technical assistance and capacity
building continue to play an integral part
of any accession process, especially for
LDCs which account for over one-third of
the ongoing accession processes.
The China Programme (or the China
LDCs and Accessions Programme)
has been instrumental in responding
to the specific needs of acceding
governments, especially those of LDCs.
On 9 December, China announced that
it was renewing its funding for a further
year. The programme offers a range of
tools, including the China Round Table,
which aims to assist acceding LDCs and
strengthen LDC members’ participation
in the WTO.

China has renewed
funding of the
programme it has
established to help
the poorest countries
join the WTO.

Joining the WTO
www.wto.org/members

In 2017, two China round tables were
held. One focused on the example of
Cambodia’s accession to the WTO.
The other, held on the margins of
MC11, reaffirmed support for LDCs
seeking to join the WTO. It also saw
the establishment of the Accession
Negotiators’ Network. The objective is to
create a platform for interaction between
accession negotiators to help countries
before and after WTO membership. Over
80 former negotiators and accession
experts have agreed to join the network.

The Government of Kenya hosted
a regional dialogue between LDC
acceding governments from the Greater
Horn of Africa which focused on
synergies between WTO accessions
and regional integration.
The WTO Secretariat organized a first
specialized training course for accession
negotiators focusing on bilateral market
access negotiations on goods.
On the margins of MC11, eight postconflict LDCs launched the g7+
WTO Accessions Group, which has
pledged to use the accession process
to foster peace and stability. The group
comprises three recently acceded LDCs
(Afghanistan, Liberia and Yemen), four
acceding LDCs (Comoros, São Tomé
and Príncipe, Somalia and Timor-Leste)
and South Sudan.
The WTO launched a new publication
entitled Trade Multilateralism in the 21st
Century: Building the Upper Floors
of the Trading System through WTO
Accessions on the margins of MC11.
The book draws on recent accessions
experiences and examines how an
updated and robust rules-based
multilateral framework, anchored in the
WTO, can maximize the benefits of
global economic integration and help
revive world trade (see page 181).

Trade negotiations

T rade negot iat ion s
i n 2017
•	 WTO members worked hard to advance trade
negotiations ahead of the 11th Ministerial Conference
(MC11) held on 10-13 December 2017 in Buenos Aires.
•	 Discussions focused on agriculture, fisheries subsidies,
services and special and differential treatment for
developing countries.
•	 D
 espite a high level of engagement, positions
remained far apart in key areas. The Chair of the Trade
Negotiations Committee said in late November that he did
not see agreed negotiated outcomes for members to take
to MC11.
•	 M
 C11 ended with a decision on fisheries subsidies and
decisions in a number of other areas.

Background on
trade negotiations
Trade negotiations take place in
the Trade Negotiations Committee
(TNC) and its subsidiaries,
which are regular councils
and committees meeting in
special session or specially
created negotiating bodies.
The negotiating bodies report
to the TNC, which supervises
the overall conduct of their work.

Entry into force of the amendment to the
WTO’s intellectual property agreement
regarding affordable medicines in
January 2017 (see page 100) and the
Trade Facilitation Agreement in February
(see page 94) as well as steps taken to
implement the Nairobi Decision ending
farm export subsidies (see page 72)
provided a positive backdrop to WTO
members’ efforts early in the year to make
progress in the negotiations and achieve
substantive results in Buenos Aires.
In February, Director-General Azevêdo,
as Trade Negotiations Committee
(TNC) Chair, convened consultations
to facilitate exchanges among
delegations. In reporting on his
consultations, he encouraged members
to intensify their engagement and
to become more specific in their
discussions. Negotiations continued
throughout the year under the leadership
of the negotiating group chairs and the
TNC Chair. Members tried to find ways
to narrow their differences. A number
of papers and submissions were
presented, which helped focus and
advance the negotiations.

	

44

World Trade Organization  Annual Report 2018

Members paid special attention to
agriculture, notably the issues of public
stockholding for food security and
domestic support (subsidies), but also to
fisheries subsidies, domestic regulation in
services trade and special and differential
treatment for developing countries.
Aside from these areas, there was
growing interest expressed by a group
of members in deepening discussions
in areas such as e-commerce,
investment facilitation and strengthening
the participation of micro, small and
medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) in
international trade. Several seminars and
informal dialogue sessions took place
and many submissions were tabled.

Looking to Buenos Aires
Work intensified in the lead-up to the
summer and the TNC Chair welcomed
the more detailed text-based submissions
and discussions. However, he noted
that the approaches and ambition varied
widely and that a lot of work remained to
be done before Buenos Aires. He called
for greater urgency and encouraged
delegations, especially those putting
forward negotiating proposals, to direct
their efforts towards building momentum
behind their ideas.

-----------------------Page 46 End-----------------------

Argentine minister Susana Malcorra,
Chair of MC11, addressed members in
July. She noted that the WTO was facing
challenging times, with globalization
and open markets often blamed for
job disruption and inequality, breeding
protectionist tendencies and insularity.
The challenges should push members to
act with even more conviction to ensure
that the role and function of the WTO are
preserved and strengthened. Echoing
the Director-General, she encouraged
members to use the Buenos Aires
Ministerial Conference to recommit to
the multilateral trading system.

DG Azevêdo is
Chair of the
Trade Negotiations
Committee.

As the Ministerial Conference drew
closer, the TNC Chair urged members
to prioritize their work and focus on
the most promising areas. This meant
categorizing the issues into two broad
groups. First would be the issues that
were not advancing fast enough. Here,
members could focus on developing
a post-Buenos-Aires work programme
to be adopted at MC11. Second were
the issues that had the potential to be
finalized in Buenos Aires. On these,
members should further intensify their
work and aim to go as far as possible in
Geneva, leaving only a few final political
calls for ministers. He asked members
to balance ambition and realism in their
quest to deliver at MC11.
With regard to the issues not covered
by negotiating groups or WTO
subsidiary bodies, such as investment
facilitation and MSMEs, he said that the
responsibility to advance rested with
the proponents. They needed to decide
clearly what they wished to achieve.
The TNC Chair’s calls for maximizing the
time and prioritizing work were reinforced
by the MC11 Chair. In October, she
asked members to decide very soon
which issues could be resolved at the
conference and which required further
work. “There is life after Buenos Aires,”
she said. It was equally important to
clearly demonstrate that trade could be
inclusive and bring benefits to people
around the world.

Gaps remain wide
Nevertheless, members’ positions
remained far apart. At the meeting of the
TNC and informal heads of delegations
on 28 November, the Chair said that,
given members’ positions, he did not
think there would be agreed negotiated
outcomes in Geneva. He announced

Trade negotiations in 2017
www.wto.org/tnc
	

that he and the MC11 Chair were
considering appointing five “minister
facilitators” to work with the negotiating
group chairs in Buenos Aires. This
would allow time to be better managed
during the conference. The facilitators
would hold open-ended meetings and
consultations and report back to the
membership. Every effort would be made
to ensure those meetings were open,
transparent and inclusive.
The TNC Chair said that MC11 was
an opportunity to take stock of the
significant progress made, to deliver
where possible and to set the direction
for future work. At the final General
Council meeting before MC11, members
took note of the fact that work would
continue in some negotiating groups in
an effort to make as much progress as
possible on the matters that ministers
might take up in Buenos Aires.

Buenos Aires
In Buenos Aires, discussions continued
with the assistance of five minister
facilitators. They were: Kenya’s Cabinet
Secretary for Foreign Affairs Amina
Mohamed for agriculture, Jamaica’s
Foreign Affairs and Foreign Trade Minister
Kamina Johnson Smith for fisheries
subsidies, Norway’s Foreign Minister
Ine Eriksen Søreide for development,
Senegal’s Trade Minister Alioune Sarr
for e-commerce and Paraguay’s Foreign
Minister Eladio Loizaga Caballero for
domestic regulation in services and
transparency in regulatory measures in
non-agriculture market access (NAMA).
The facilitators reported regularly to
the full membership. These meetings
followed the principles of transparency
and inclusiveness – which many
delegations had emphasized in
the preparatory process for MC11.
Members worked hard to try to narrow
their differences in the six areas under
the facilitators’ process.
In the end, agreement could not be
reached in many of the areas under
discussion. However, the conference
ended with a ministerial decision to
continue with negotiations on fisheries
subsidies, with the aim of sealing a deal
by the Ministerial Conference in 2019.
A number of other ministerial decisions
were taken regarding e-commerce, the
Work Programme on Small Economies,
and “non-violation and situation”
complaints in intellectual property.

Trade negotiations

Ag r ic u lt u re
•	 The Committee on Agriculture meeting in special
session carried out intense negotiations during the year.
The Committee Chair held more than 100 meetings.
•	 WTO members made a number of proposals in key
areas, such as public stockholding for food security
and domestic support.
•	 D
 espite sustained efforts at the Ministerial Conference,
no agreements were reached in Buenos Aires.

Background on agriculture
The broad objective of the
agriculture negotiations is to reduce
distortions in agricultural trade
caused by high tariffs and other
barriers, export subsidies and
domestic support measures.
The negotiations take place in the
WTO Committee on Agriculture,
meeting in special session. They are
also to take into account the needs
of developing countries.

Intense negotiations took place
throughout 2017 to identify a potential
agricultural outcome for the 11th WTO
Ministerial Conference (MC11) in
Buenos Aires. Ambassador Stephen
Karau from Kenya, who took over as
Chair of the special session of the
Committee on Agriculture and the SubCommittee on Cotton in April, held more
than 100 meetings in various formats.
On 4 December, the Chair circulated his
final report summarizing the state of play
in the negotiations and recommending
that members work towards a limited
outcome potentially comprising
decisions on some key negotiating
issues and a work programme to guide
the negotiations post-MC11.
Despite sustained efforts in Buenos
Aires, where negotiations were
conducted with the assistance of the
ministerial facilitator for agriculture,
Kenya’s Foreign Minister Amina
Mohamed, members were not able
to agree on a substantive outcome or
on a work programme. Nevertheless,
the MC11 Chair noted at the closing
session members’ commitment to
advancing negotiations on all remaining
issues, including the three pillars of the
agricultural negotiations.

Public stockholding for
food security purposes
Public stockholding for food security
purposes was a priority issue for MC11
and intensive discussions took place
throughout the year. Members sought
to meet the ministerial mandates from

	

46

World Trade Organization  Annual Report 2018

Bali and Nairobi to find a permanent
solution to the stockpile question by
the end of 2017.
At issue are public stockpiles of food
procured at administered prices to
ensure food availability. Some believe
that without effective controls, these
programmes will lead to over-production
and depressed prices that could affect
farmers worldwide. Until a permanent
solution is found, the ministerial
decisions permit support to farmers
under stockpiling programmes under
a so-called “peace clause”, provided
certain conditions are met.
Four proposals were submitted during
the year. A proposal from Brazil, the
European Union, Colombia, Peru
and Uruguay and a proposal from the
G-33 (a group of developing countries
pressing for flexibility for developing
countries to undertake limited market
opening in agriculture) suggested
exempting public stockholding
programmes from WTO limits on farm
subsidies, known as the aggregate
measurement of support (AMS), and
placing different conditions on them.
The two other proposals – one from
Russia and Paraguay and the other from
Norway and Singapore – sought to build
on the Bali Ministerial Decision and
provide a legal shield against challenges
under the Agreement on Agriculture.
The latter two proposals gained broader
support during the year, owing to the fact
that the Bali decision was accepted by
all members in December 2013.

Agriculture
www.wto.org/agnegs

-----------------------Page 48 End-----------------------

Members discussed issues such as
country and programme coverage,
product coverage, safeguards and
anti-circumvention provisions and
transparency provisions. However,
they could not bridge the gaps in
their positions.

Domestic support
Domestic support (subsidies) was
considered a priority by many members.
The importance attached to this pillar
of the negotiations (the other two are
market access and export competition)
by members was demonstrated by the
numerous submissions and proposals
submitted by a broad range of members,
representing diverse views.

Numerous proposals
were submitted
by WTO members
on how to limit
domestic subsidies.

While members broadly agreed
on further limiting trade-distorting
domestic support, which can lead to
overproduction of agricultural products
and affect world market prices, their
views on how to reach this objective
varied significantly.
The introduction of an overall limit on
trade-distorting domestic support was
suggested in several submissions.
While there was broad support for
the introduction of such a limit, some

Agriculture
www.wto.org/agnegs

members remained opposed. There were
also differences over how the limit should
be set: should it be a fixed ceiling, for
example, or a percentage of production?
Some developing countries called for
developed countries to remove all of
their most trade-distorting support but
other members saw this as unrealistic.
A related issue was the type of support
to which the limit should apply and
whether it should cover only the most
trade-distorting or also include other,
less distorting subsidies.
While there was recognition that
so-called green box farm support,
which includes direct income support
to farmers and environmental protection
programmes, is non-trade distorting
or minimally distorting, several members
argued for further disciplines
because of doubts about whether
certain programmes meet the
prescribed criteria.
Despite significant efforts, members’
negotiating positions on the key issues
in domestic support remained too wide
apart for a successful outcome at MC11.

Trade negotiations

Cotton
All members recognize the need to
address cotton within the agriculture
negotiations, including reductions
in trade-distorting subsidies and
improvements in market access
for cotton exports from least-developed
countries. However, members
have divergent positions regarding
cotton subsidies and domestic
support generally.

All members
recognize the need
to address cotton
within the agriculture
negotiations, including
reductions in tradedistorting subsidies
and improving
market access.

The Cotton Four countries – Mali, Chad,
Benin and Burkina Faso – circulated
a draft ministerial decision on cotton in
October, calling for sharp reductions in
domestic support for cotton. However,
some members said the proposal was
too ambitious. Other proposals, notably
one from Brazil, the European Union,
Colombia, Peru and Uruguay, one from
the Least-Developed Countries (LDCs)
Group and one from Argentina also
included elements aimed at making
progress on cotton domestic support.
The cotton discussions also covered
how to further improve cotton
development assistance as part of an
MC11 outcome. These discussions
took place under the Director-General’s
Consultative Framework Mechanism on
Cotton dedicated to the development
aspects of cotton. The cotton
transparency and monitoring process
resulting from the Bali Ministerial
Decision and extended by the Nairobi

	

48

World Trade Organization  Annual Report 2018

Ministerial Decision continued in 2017
and two dedicated discussions of the
relevant trade-related developments for
cotton were held.
A Cotton Portal was jointly launched
by the WTO and the International Trade
Centre (ITC) in December at MC11.
This online platform for market
intelligence provides a single entry
point for all cotton-specific information
available in WTO and ITC databases
on market access, trade statistics,
country-specific business contacts
and development assistance-related
information as well as links to relevant
documents, webpages and other
organizations active in the cotton sector.

Market access
Members generally acknowledged that
a substantive outcome in market access
was not feasible for MC11 but many
hoped at least for an agreement on a
programme for post-MC11 work.
During the year, some members sought
to pursue reform of trade barriers in
an incremental manner as part of the
agriculture negotiations and presented
a number of papers. In one paper,
Paraguay and Peru addressed high trade
barriers in agriculture, including complex
tariff structures, relatively high tariffs
(“tariff peaks”) and higher import duties
on finished or semi-processed products
than on raw materials (“tariff escalation”).
Agriculture

-----------------------Page 50 End-----------------------

Special safeguard
mechanism
Discussions continued regarding the
Nairobi Ministerial Decision on a special
safeguard mechanism (SSM). This
decision stated that talks to create
an SSM – mandated in July 2004 –
would continue in a dedicated session.
The creation of an SSM would allow
developing countries to raise tariffs
temporarily to address import surges
or price declines.
The debates continued to reveal
divergent positions on the issue of the
linkage between the SSM and the overall
market access negotiations. The G-33
suggested that members agree at MC11
on a first operational outcome that would
take the form of either a price-based
SSM to address price depressions or a
volume-based one for import surges.
The Philippines subsequently proposed
that members adopt a price-based
SSM at MC11. However, a number of
members argued that such an outcome
was unrealistic in the absence of a
broader outcome in market access.

Export prohibitions
and restrictions
Many members said
improved transparency
was critical to ensuring
food security.

Agriculture
www.wto.org/agnegs

Building on earlier submissions,
Singapore introduced a paper
advocating enhanced transparency in
export restrictions. A key element of the
proposal was that as a general rule, a
notification should be submitted at least
30 days prior to the implementation of an
export restriction measure. The proposal

also sought to exempt food purchases
for non-commercial humanitarian
purposes by the World Food Programme
from such export-limiting measures.
Many members said improved
transparency was critical to ensuring
food security while some cautioned
against making these requirements too
burdensome for developing countries.
Some members expressed an interest
in broadening the discussions to
cover elements not included in the
proposal by Singapore. Israel, Japan,
Korea, Switzerland and Chinese Taipei
tabled a proposal aimed at clarifying
and strengthening the rules when a
member applies export prohibitions and
restrictions. However, there was broad
agreement that an outcome on these
issues could not be envisaged at MC11
in the absence of a broader package.

Export competition
Some members supported continuing
negotiations on export finance,
agricultural exporting state trading
enterprises and international food aid to
build on the Nairobi Ministerial Decision
on export competition. Under this
decision, developed countries were to
eliminate export subsidies immediately
with some exceptions while developing
countries were given a longer time to
remove their subsidies (see page 72).

Trade negotiations

Ma rket ac c e s s for
non-ag r ic u lt u ral
p roduc t s
•	 The Negotiating Group discussed a proposal to facilitate
participation of small and medium-sized enterprises
in global trade.
•	 The proposal called for greater transparency and
access to information about government regulations
on food and product safety. The proposal attracted
support and opposition.
•	 At the Ministerial Conference in Buenos Aires,
no agreement was reached on this issue.

Background on market
access for nonagricultural products
Non-agricultural products are
products not covered by the
Agreement on Agriculture.
These range from manufactured
goods to fuels and fisheries.
Collectively, they represent
more than 90 per cent of
world merchandise trade.
The negotiations aim to reduce
or, as appropriate, eliminate
tariffs as well as non-tariff barriers,
particularly on goods of export
interest to developing countries.
The negotiations are conducted
in the Negotiating Group on
Market Access.

The Negotiating Group held two
meetings in 2017, at which a proposal
aimed at helping small and medium-sized
enterprises (SMEs) was discussed. The
proponents of the proposal said it would
facilitate the participation of SMEs in
global trade by bringing about greater
transparency and access to information
about government regulations on food
and product safety.
The transparency proposal was initially
put forward by the European Union,
Hong Kong (China), Singapore and
Chinese Taipei and subsequently also
co-sponsored by Australia, Canada,
Japan and Korea.
The proposal called for ministers to agree
at the Ministerial Conference in Buenos
Aires on a series of actions, including the
development of a public internet portal for
regulatory measures, consultation with

stakeholders during the development
of a regulatory measure, notification of
the final text of regulatory measures,
and making available regulatory measures
via the internet. It also called for the
adoption of a work programme in order
to develop additional provisions relating
to transparency covered in the WTO’s
Agreement on Sanitary and Phytosanitary
Measures and the Technical Barriers
to Trade Agreement.
During discussions at two meetings of
the Negotiating Group, the proposal
received support from a number of
quarters but also opposition from several
others. Concerns included the possible
increase of administrative burdens for
developing countries and the curtailing
of regulatory policy space.
In his report to the Trade Negotiations
Committee, Chair Didier Chambovey
of Switzerland noted the advantages
suggested by proponents and the
concerns raised by others. The
proposal was taken up at the Ministerial
Conference and after his consultations
with ministers, the facilitator, Paraguay’s
Trade Minister Eladio Loizaga Caballero,
concluded that positions were too far
apart to take the proposal forward.
In her concluding remarks, the Ministerial
Conference Chair noted that WTO
members agreed to advance negotiations
on all remaining issues, including on nonagricultural market access.

S er v ic e s
•	 Discussions on services focused on domestic regulation
in the lead-up to the Ministerial Conference.
•	 Other areas discussed during the year included services
trade facilitation, services related to e-commerce and
market access.
•	 Discussions on domestic regulation continued at the
Ministerial Conference but the minister facilitator
concluded it was not possible to achieve consensus
on a way forward.

Background on services
The General Agreement on Trade
in Services (GATS) mandates
WTO members to progressively
open up trade in services through
rounds of negotiations. The
negotiations are overseen by the
Council for Trade in Services,
meeting in special session, and
its subsidiary bodies, in particular
the Working Party on Domestic
Regulation and the Working Party
on GATS Rules.

Various WTO members
presented proposals on
domestic regulation of
services trade.

Negotiations on services focused
on domestic regulation, trade facilitation
for services, online services transactions
and market access.

Domestic regulation
In the first half of 2017, various WTO
members jointly presented text proposals
under negotiations on domestic
regulatory aspects of services trade
being carried out in the Working Party
on Domestic Regulation. The working
party’s mandate is to develop any
necessary disciplines to ensure that
licensing and qualification requirements
and procedures do not constitute
unnecessary barriers to trade in services.
The proposals were consolidated
into a single text covering general
provisions, administration of measures,
independence, transparency, technical
standards, development of measures
on gender equality, necessity and
development. The text was updated in
November and December 2017. It is
supported by 29 co-sponsors (57 if
counting EU member states individually).
The proposed disciplines, which cut
across services sectors in which
members have commitments, revealed
differences among members. The cosponsors consider that the proposed
rules on licensing and qualification
requirements and procedures and on
technical standards would yield greater
transparency and predictability and
provide important value added to existing
market access commitments. They also
consider that their proposal is flexible

Services
www.wto.org/servicesnegs 	

as it would allow implementation
by members at different levels of
development and regulatory capacity
as well as by means of diverse
regulatory approaches.
Some members expressed general
support for the proposal while pointing
to a limited number of drafting and
technical issues that they wished to see
addressed. Others had more significant
reservations. The latter included:
language on the right to regulate;
development provisions; the absence
of specific provisions on qualification
requirements and procedures; proposed
disciplines on gender equality and
necessity; and the application of the
proposed disciplines to varied levels
of sector-specific commitments across
the membership.
Other members questioned the need
for the proposed disciplines and the
benefits these might bring to developing
countries and least developed countries
(LDCs). This group maintained that the
proposed text would be incompatible
with their development aspirations and
limit policy space.
Further discussions on domestic
regulation of services took place at the
Ministerial Conference in Buenos Aires,
with Paraguay’s Trade Minister Eladio
Loizaga Caballero serving as facilitator
(see page 33). However, delegations’
positions remained entrenched and the
facilitator concluded it was not possible
to achieve consensus at the Conference
on a way forward.

Trade facilitation for
services and online
services transactions
India circulated a draft text on a proposal
for a trade facilitation agreement
on services aimed at reducing the
bottlenecks that services and services’
suppliers face. The proposal focuses
on issues such as publication and
availability of information, administration
of measures, fees and charges,
administration of economic needs
tests, recognition, cross-border flows
of information and the facilitation of
the movement of persons and of
consumption abroad.
The proposal was discussed at a
dedicated meeting of the special
session of the Council for Trade in
Services in May 2017, where views

	

52

World Trade Organization  Annual Report 2018

expressed by WTO members differed
in various areas. In July, India circulated
a revised proposal.
In May, the European Union proposed
a draft text for rules to facilitate online
service transactions. The proposal
focuses on electronic contracts,
electronic authentication and trust
services, consumer protection and
unsolicited commercial electronic
messages. It was discussed at a
dedicated meeting of the special
session in June.
In view of the limited time left before
the Ministerial Conference, these two
proposals were not further discussed in
the lead-up to the Conference. However,
India and the European Union signalled
their interest in resuming discussions of
their respective proposals in 2018.

Outcome of
Ministerial Conference
No decisions on services were taken
at the Ministerial Conference. However,
at the end of the Conference, the Chair
noted that WTO members agreed to
advance negotiations on all remaining
issues, including on services.

Trade-related
aspects of
intellectual property
rights (TRIPS)
•	 The special session of the TRIPS Council held its first
meeting since 2014.
•	 Negotiations on geographical indications for wines
and spirits were not seen as a priority in the run-up
to the Ministerial Conference in Buenos Aires.

Background on
trade-related aspects
of intellectual
property rights
Negotiations on a multilateral
system for notifying and registering
geographical indications for wines
and spirits are carried out in the
TRIPS Council in special session.

Members remained
divided on product
coverage of a GI
register and whether
the register should
be confined to wines
and spirits.

Register for
geographical indications
In 2017, the special session of the
Council for Trade-related Aspects of
Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS)
held its first formal meeting since
2014 to record WTO members’ views
on negotiations for a multilateral register
for geographical indications (GIs) for
wines and spirits and to reflect on
how to continue the work in this area.
WTO members did not consider
the negotiations a priority for the
Ministerial Conference.
The register is intended to facilitate the
protection of GIs for wines and spirits.
These are indications (including place
names or other terms or signs associated
with a place) used to identify products
whose place of origin contributes to
their special qualities, reputation or
other characteristics.

wines and spirits or whether it could also
apply to other products, such as food
and agricultural products. Differences
also remained over whether linkages
should be made between the GI register
negotiations and the other TRIPS-related
implementation issues.
Given that the GI register was not a
priority for the Ministerial Conference,
no specific outcomes were expected in
Buenos Aires. However, the Conference
Chair noted at the end of the meeting
that WTO members agreed to advance
negotiations on all remaining issues,
including on TRIPS.

Members have long disagreed on the
legal effects the GI register should
have and whether it should create
obligations for all WTO members or
only those choosing to participate in
the register. They remained divided
on product coverage and on whether,
as the negotiating mandate says, the
register should be confined to GIs for

Trade negotiations

T rade and
development
•	 Discussions in the special sessions of the Committee
on Trade and Development focused on ten Agreementspecific proposals from a group of countries, including
the African, Caribbean and Pacific Group, the African
Union and the least-developed countries.
•	 The group said the aim of their revised proposals was
to foster industrialization, promote diversification and
facilitate structural transformation in their economies.
•	 The group presented a draft ministerial decision on
special and differential treatment for developing
countries for the Ministerial Conference in Buenos Aires.
•	 No agreement was reached but a constructive
ministerial dialogue on trade and development was
held in Buenos Aires.

Background on trade
and development
Special and differential treatment
(S&D) refers to the special
treatment, or flexibility, granted
to developing countries in WTO
agreements, such as longer
implementation periods. Many
WTO agreements contain
provisions that give developing
countries special rights and that
allow developed countries to treat
them more favourably than other
WTO members. Differences
among WTO members include
the definition of who exactly
should benefit from S&D. The
special session of the Committee
on Trade and Development is
mandated to review all S&D
provisions, with a view to making
them more precise, effective
and operational.

Discussions in the Committee on Trade
and Development in special session
focused on ten agreement-specific
special and differential treatment (S&D)
proposals presented by a group
of countries including the African,
Caribbean and Pacific Group, the
African Union and the least-developed
countries (LDCs).
Following a presentation of the proposals
in July, Chair of the special session,
Ambassador Tan Yee Woan (Singapore),
held a series of formal and informal
discussions and met with delegations,
with a view to developing elements of
an S&D package for the Ministerial
Conference in Buenos Aires.
The proponents explained that the
flexibilities requested in the proposals
are needed to foster industrialization,
promote diversification and facilitate
structural transformation in their
economies. While they maintained all
the agreement-specific proposals were
equal in importance and in addressing
the challenges their constituencies
face, the proponents said they attached
greatest priority to the industrialization
cluster. They argued that these measures

	

54

World Trade Organization  Annual Report 2018

would enable developing countries to
alter some of their existing obligations,
with the objective of promoting
domestic industries.
Other WTO members continued to
express concerns with the scope of the
proposals, both in terms of coverage
as well as the nature of flexibilities,
and the lack of differentiation – the
idea that members at different levels
of development should not be granted
the same flexibilities, exemptions and
concessions. They reiterated that the
revised proposals have hardly evolved
from the ones tabled in 2015, when there
were 25, and did not take account of
concerns expressed by members before
the Nairobi Ministerial Conference.
They contended that agreeing to the
flexibilities would imply that existing
multilateral trade rules are not conducive
to development, which they believed was
not the right message to send. They said
that solutions to the issues raised in the
proposals must be realistic, based on
facts, and that deviations from existing
rules should only be considered in
exceptional circumstances on the
basis of needs.

Trade and development

-----------------------Page 56 End-----------------------

Most WTO members are sensitive
to the challenges and difficulties
faced by LDCs and have expressed
their willingness to give favourable
consideration to proposals that
address the specific needs of LDCs,
provided that these needs are real and
demonstrable. Some have suggested
possible alternative approaches, such
as waivers from WTO rules, subject to
certain conditions.

During trade
negotiations at MC11,
ministers highlighted
that development is
central to WTO work.

Trade and development
www.wto.org/developmentnegs
	

The discussions on the proposals
remained polarized and it was not
possible to bridge the gaps in positions
in Geneva. The proponents submitted a
draft Ministerial Decision on Special and
Differential Treatment to Buenos Aires.
Proponents said that the Conference
had to reaffirm the commitment to
development and S&D treatment and to
harvest concrete results in this area to
promote a more stable and prosperous
global trading system. They urged all
members to constructively engage in
the discussions in order to find solutions
acceptable to all and to resolve this longstanding issue.

In discussions in Geneva, prior to
the Ministerial Conference, members
agreed to have a broader ministerial
dialogue on trade and development
at MC11. During this dialogue, which
was facilitated by Norway’s Foreign
Minister, Ine Eriksen Søreide, ministers
highlighted that development is central to
WTO work. They also shared a number
of ideas to help make progress, including
exploration of fresh approaches, such
as engaging in evidence-based dialogue
and the sharing of best practices.
However, views differed on how to take
forward these ideas, including on their
ability to facilitate progress on the
S&D proposals.
In her concluding remarks, the Chair of
the Ministerial Conference noted that
WTO members agreed to advance
negotiations on all remaining issues,
including on development.

Trade negotiations

T rade and
env i ron ment
•	 The Chair of the Committee on Trade and Environment
in special session held an informal information session
on past work.
•	 No new proposals were submitted.
•	 The Ministerial Conference Chair noted that WTO members
are committed to advancing negotiations in all remaining
issues, including on trade and the environment.

Background on trade
and environment
The negotiations cover the
relationship between existing
WTO rules and specific trade
obligations set out in multilateral
environmental agreements
(MEAs), procedures for regular
information exchange between
MEA secretariats and the
relevant WTO committees, and
the reduction or, as appropriate,
elimination of tariff and non-tariff
barriers to environmental goods
and services.

The Chair of the special session
of the Committee on Trade and
Environment, Ambassador Syed Tauqir
Shah (Pakistan), hosted an informal,
information session in October covering
past work. The WTO Secretariat
presented a factual overview of the
discussions that had taken place so
far. The meeting was an opportunity for
delegations to seek clarification and
share thoughts.
Several delegations reiterated the
importance of environmental issues
and of discussing trade and environment
issues in the WTO. A number of
delegations said trade and environment

	

56

World Trade Organization  Annual Report 2018

should feature in any ministerial
declaration or text issued at the
Ministerial Conference in Buenos
Aires but no new proposals were
submitted in 2017.
In Buenos Aires, the Conference
Chair said in her closing statement that
WTO members agreed to advance
negotiations on all remaining issues,
including on trade and environment.
In 2017, there were no further discussions
on a possible Environmental Goods
Agreement. Forty-six WTO members
had been taking part in the negotiations,
which were launched in 2014.

W TO r u le s
•	 Fisheries subsidies were the focus of work as the
Negotiating Group on Rules considered a broad range
of proposals for new disciplines to be agreed at the
Ministerial Conference in Buenos Aires.
•	 The Group submitted to Buenos Aires a draft ministerial
decision containing a range of options for interim
commitments on subsidies contributing to illegal,
unreported and unregulated fishing.
•	 In Buenos Aires, ministers agreed on a work programme
with a view to adopting an agreement on fisheries
subsidies disciplines by the next Ministerial Conference
in 2019.
•	 The Negotiating Group also debated proposals on
transparency and due process in anti-dumping and
countervailing proceedings, and on subsidy notifications.

In 2017, fisheries subsidies continued
to be the principal focus of work in
the Negotiating Group on Rules,
chaired by Ambassador Wayne
McCook of Jamaica.

Background
on WTO rules
In 2001, ministers launched WTO
negotiations to clarify and improve
WTO rules on anti-dumping,
subsidies and countervailing
measures, fisheries subsidies and
regional trade agreements (RTAs).
In 2005, ministers elaborated the
negotiating mandates, including
for fisheries subsidies.

Over the course of the year, a broad and
diverse set of members and groups (the
African, Caribbean and Pacific Group;
Argentina, Colombia, Costa Rica,
Panama, Peru, and Uruguay; China; the
European Union; Indonesia; the Group
of Least-developed Countries; New
Zealand, Iceland and Pakistan; Norway;
and the Philippines) submitted a total
of nine textual proposals for decisions
to establish new disciplines on fisheries
subsidies at the WTO’s 11th Ministerial
Conference (MC11) in Buenos Aires in
December 2017.

WTO members
submitted a range
of proposals on
establishing new
disciplines on
fisheries subsidies.

WTO rules
www.wto.org/rulesnegs

All of the proposals aimed to meet
the United Nations’ Sustainable
Development Goal target 14.6, which
sets a deadline of 2020 for prohibiting
certain forms of fisheries subsidies
that contribute to overcapacity and
overfishing, for eliminating subsidies
that contribute to illegal, unreported
and unregulated (IUU) fishing, and for
refraining from introducing new such
subsidies, with appropriate and effective
special and differential treatment

for developing and least-developed
countries as an integral part of the
WTO negotiations.
Through a progressive process of
compilation and consolidation of
the proposals – undertaken in the
Negotiating Group in the lead-up
to MC11 – a series of streamlined
negotiating texts was produced on some
of the issues. In spite of the intensive
work to produce them, the Negotiating
Group recognized that these texts were
not ready for action by ministers.
The Group then turned its attention
to preparing a draft Ministerial Decision,
which it agreed to forward to MC11
for consideration. This draft text
contained, among other things, a range
of options for interim commitments on
subsidies contributing to IUU fishing
(see page 32). In spite of the intensive
work to produce this draft, and further
intensive work in Buenos Aires led by
ministerial facilitator Jamaican Minister
of Foreign Affairs and Foreign Trade,
Kamina Johnson Smith, members’ views
remained too divided for any substantive
agreement in Buenos Aires. However,
there was scope for some important
progress to be made.

Ministers decided on a work
programme, with a view to adopting
by the 12th Ministerial Conference
(2019) an agreement to prohibit
fisheries subsidies that contribute
to IUU fishing and to overcapacity
and overfishing, with appropriate
and effective special and differential
treatment for developing countries
as an integral part of the negotiations.
Ministers also re-committed to
implementation of existing
notification obligations in respect
of fisheries subsidies.

World Trade Organization  Annual Report 2018

During 2017, the Negotiating Group on
Rules also considered proposals on due
process and transparency, and certain
other issues, in respect of anti-dumping
and countervailing duty investigations,
and a proposal on subsidies disciplines.
No specific proposals in these areas
were forwarded to MC11 for
consideration by ministers.
During the year, work also continued in
the Technical Group, a forum in which
delegations exchange information about
their anti-dumping practices.

 TO members signalled willingness to continue working
through the 12 issues under discussion.
•	 Some members expressed disappointment at the lack
of concrete negotiating results so far.

Background on the
Dispute Settlement
Understanding
In November 2001, at the Doha
Ministerial Conference, WTO
members agreed to negotiate to
improve and clarify the Dispute
Settlement Understanding – the
rules and procedures governing
the settlement of WTO disputes.
These negotiations take place in
special sessions of the Dispute
Settlement Body.

Dispute Settlement Understanding
www.wto.org/disputenegs 	

Ambassador Coly Seck of Senegal took
over as Chair of the special session of
the Dispute Settlement Body in May
2017, replacing Ambassador Stephen
Karau of Kenya.
Ambassador Seck continued his
predecessor’s approach of working
through the issues in a sequential
and focused manner. Earlier in 2017,
Ambassador Karau conducted work on
mutually agreed solutions and thirdparty rights, two of the 12 issues under
discussion. In July 2017, the Chair
reported that work on two additional
issues – strictly confidential information
and sequencing – had been completed.
Sequencing refers to the question
of whether, in a dispute, compliance
proceedings or the retaliation
proceedings take precedence.

Among the 12 issues that have been
under discussion for several years
are developing country concerns,
including special and differential
treatment, and remand (referral of
cases by the Appellate Body to
panels for further action).
After the summer, the Dispute
Settlement Body in special session
conducted a stock-taking exercise
covering the period November 2016
to July 2017. The Chair reported that
members generally agreed that no
outcomes could be prepared for the
Ministerial Conference in Buenos
Aires. Some members expressed
disappointment at the continued lack of
results. Nevertheless, members generally
recognized the value of the work.
They signalled their willingness to
work through the remaining issues.

G eneral C ou nc i l
•	 The General Council reappointed Director-General
Roberto Azevêdo to second four-year term.
•	 The General Council Chair conducted extensive
consultations throughout the year in preparation for the
11th Ministerial Conference (MC11) in Buenos Aires.
•	 The Chair regularly reported to the Council on
implementation of the Bali and Nairobi decisions,
including on export competition.
•	 The General Council submitted its report and the reports
of its subsidiary bodies to MC11; the Chair reported that
a number of WTO members’ individual proposals would
be put before ministers.

Background on the
General Council
The General Council is entrusted
with carrying out the functions
of the WTO and taking actions
necessary to this effect between
ministerial conferences in addition
to carrying out the specific tasks
assigned to it by the Agreement
establishing the WTO.

Appointment of the
WTO Director-General
On 28 February 2017, WTO members
agreed by consensus to appoint Roberto
Azevêdo for a second four-year term
as Director-General. The second term
began on 1 September. He was the
only candidate nominated for the
post when the process closed on
31 December 2016.
Prior to the decision on his
re-appointment, on 27 February,
DG Azevêdo had made a presentation
to the General Council outlining the
achievements during his first term
and challenges for the organization.
He took questions on the management
of the WTO and the challenges facing
the multilateral trading system,
among other issues.
In thanking members for his re-election
and support, DG Azevêdo said he
believed the WTO “is on the right path.
We have achieved a great deal over the
last few years. The WTO is stronger
today than it was in 2013.” He went on
to say: “But we can do much more —
particularly for the smaller players and
those who feel cut off from the economic
benefits of trade. We must build a more
inclusive trading system. I look forward to
working with you all to that end.”

Ministerial Conference
General Council Chair Xavier Carim
(South Africa) conducted a preparatory

	

62

World Trade Organization  Annual Report 2018

process on both the substantive and
the organizational aspects of MC11.
Delegations were consulted regularly
on issues such as the appointment
of officers for the conference, the
participation of observers and of nongovernmental organizations (NGOs).
On the substantive aspects, work took
place in negotiating and regular bodies
to finalize possible deliverables. The Chair
undertook extensive consultations on a
possible outcome document for MC11.
In addition, a representative drafting
group was established to begin work
on a draft Ministerial Declaration, with
regular reports by the GC Chair to the
whole membership. While consensus
could not be achieved on a text, this
work constituted the basis for further
discussions at MC11. But in the end,
no final Ministerial Declaration could be
agreed in Buenos Aires (see page 32).

Implementation of Bali
and Nairobi outcomes
The General Council regularly reviewed
progress in the implementation of
decisions that ministers had taken in
Bali, at MC9, and in Nairobi, at MC10.
In particular, the Chair regularly reported
on the implementation of the Nairobi
Decision on Export Competition,
including the steps taken by members
with scheduled export subsidy reduction
commitments to eliminate their
entitlements (see page 72).

General Council
www.wto.org/gc

-----------------------Page 64 End-----------------------

The Prime Minister of Mali, Abdoulaye
Idrissa Maīga, addressed the
November General Council meeting
on the importance of strengthening the
multilateral trading system to ensure
sustainable development. He said that
achieving concrete, fair and balanced
outcomes on cotton (see page 48) would
be an important signal in that respect.

E-commerce

Regular reports and discussions also
took place on efforts to implement
decisions aimed at benefiting leastdeveloped countries (LDCs), such as the
decision on preferential rules of origin
(see page 86), implementation of the
services waiver (see page 97) and dutyfree quota-free market access.

WTO members
agreed by consensus
to appoint Roberto
Azevêdo for a second
four-year term as
Director-General.

Furthermore, at its meeting in February
2017, the Council formally took note of
the entry into force, on 22 February, of
the Agreement on Trade Facilitation
(see page 95).

Amendment of Trade Policy
Review Mechanism
In July, the General Council adopted an
amendment to the Trade Policy Review
Mechanism (see page 114) to extend
the period between reviews from two,
four or six years to three, five or seven
years respectively, effective as of
1 January 2019.

The General
Council forwarded
eight proposals
on e-commerce to
ministers at MC11.

Other reports
The General Council considered regular
reports on the work programme on small
economies (see page 150) as well as
on the development assistance aspects
of cotton (see page 48) and WTO
accessions (see page 36).
On small economies, the General
Council submitted a recommendation
for a decision to the Ministerial
Conference. The decision, which was
subsequently adopted by ministers
in Buenos Aires, called, among other
things, on the Committee on Trade
and Development to continue work on
challenges faced by small economies
(see page 150).

General Council
www.wto.org/gc

The chairs of the Council for Trade
in Services, the Council for Trade in
Goods, the Council for Trade-related
Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights
(TRIPS) and the Committee on Trade
and Development – which implement
the 1998 e-commerce work programme
– reported what was being done in their
respective areas.
The Chair of the General Council
announced he would, after the summer
break, begin consultations in preparation
for MC11. The consultations, in various
configurations, were based on four
questions posed by the Chair: the future
of the work programme; the moratorium
on electronic transmissions; the
setting up of a working group or other
institutional structure, as suggested
by some members; and a possible
mandate for negotiations on
e-commerce (see page 97).
At the last General Council meeting
of 2017, the Chair reported there were
eight submitted proposals containing
draft ministerial decision language. It
was clear that members’ positions had
not changed in any substantial manner
and the General Council had no option
but to forward all eight to ministers. The
proposals covered a range of positions,
from maintaining the work programme
to establishing a working party with a
mandate for future negotiations.
At MC11, discussions on e-commerce
were facilitated by Senegal Trade
Minister Alioune Sarr, working in close
cooperation with the General Council
Chair. The consultations resulted
in the adoption of a Ministerial
Decision on the Work Programme
on Electronic Commerce. Ministers
agreed to seek to “reinvigorate” work
under the Work Programme.

Implementation and monitoring

The General Council
was chaired by
Xavier Carim in 2017.

They instructed the General Council
to hold periodic reviews based on
the reports submitted by the relevant
WTO bodies and to report to the next
Ministerial Conference. They also agreed
to maintain the current practice of not
imposing customs duties on electronic
transmissions until the next Conference.
In Buenos Aires, 71 members agreed
to initiate exploratory work together
towards future negotiations on traderelated aspects of e-commerce, with
participation open to all WTO members.

TRIPS-related matters
The protocol amending the TRIPS
Agreement, which grants developing
countries the right to import affordable
medicines through compulsory licences,
entered into force on 23 January 2017
upon its acceptance by two-thirds of the
WTO membership. In November, the
General Council agreed to extend the
period of acceptance of the protocol for
those members who had not yet done so,
to 31 December 2019 (see page 100).

Reports by members
on informal dialogues
and initiatives
A number of members reported to
the General Council on workshops,
informal dialogues and other memberled initiatives undertaken in a variety
of subjects, including micro, small and
medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs)
(see page 176), investment facilitation
(see page 90) and e-commerce.

Implementation and monitoring

T rade i n good s
•	 The Council for Trade in Goods addressed many
trade concerns, including 12 new ones.
•	 WTO members highlighted the importance of
transparency and the need to submit timely and
complete notifications.
•	 The Council considered proposals submitted by
various members on e-commerce.
•	 The Council approved four collective waiver requests.

Background on
trade in goods
The Council for Trade in Goods
is responsible for the workings
of WTO agreements on trade
in goods. It consists of the full
WTO membership and reports
to the WTO General Council.
The Goods Council has 12
subsidiary committees dealing
with specific subjects, such
as agriculture, market access,
subsidies, technical barriers to
trade, sanitary and phytosanitary
measures, import licensing,
customs valuation, and the
new WTO committee on trade
facilitation. These committees
also comprise all WTO members.
Working parties on state trading
enterprises and the Information
Technology Agreement also report
to the Goods Council.

WTO members raised a number of
new trade concerns, including certain
measures adopted by Brazil, China,
Egypt, India, Kazakhstan, Pakistan,
Russia and Ukraine.
Five members, including the United
States, the European Union and Japan,
complained about Egypt’s decision to
allow imports in 25 product categories
(apparel, toys, chocolate, cosmetics,
milk and dairy products, motorcycles
and washing machines) only if these
items were produced by manufacturing
facilities, or imported from companies,
registered in the Ministry of Trade’s
General Organization for Export and
Import Control.
Other issues raised by members
included China’s lack of timely and

Members also raised Ukraine’s practices
in determining the normal values and
levels of final anti-dumping duties on
imports of nitrogen fertilizers, Russia’s
mandatory certification for cement
and “good manufacturing practice”
certificates for pharmaceuticals, as well
as its repeated extension of a temporary
ban on exports of skins and hides,
Kazakhstan’s restrictions on transit of
goods with the Kyrgyz Republic, and
Pakistan’s closure of the entry points at

trade and transit from 17 February to
21 March, resulting in a US$ 6 million
loss for Afghan exporters and carriers.
The Council for Trade in Goods also
heard concerns regarding the decision
by Saudi Arabia, the United Arab
Emirates and Bahrain to ban the import
and export of all goods to and from
Qatar. Bahrain, speaking on behalf of
the group, invoked General Agreement
on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) Article XXI
to justify these measures, which were
intended to protect essential security
interests. According to Qatar, the
measures constitute violations of
the GATT and the WTO’s Trade
Facilitation Agreement.
Members also discussed two
investigations initiated by the United
States under Section 232 of the 1962
Trade Expansion Act into the effects of
imports of steel and aluminium products
on US national security. Russia, the
European Union, China, Brazil and
Australia expressed concerns about
possible remedy measures that the
United States could adopt and
their consistency with GATT 1994,
the Anti-Dumping Agreement and the
Safeguards Agreement. They stressed
that national security should not be
used to achieve trade policy objectives
and that over-capacity was a global
challenge where international trade
rules should be upheld.
The United States said the investigations
would consider a number of factors,
including domestic production needs,
domestic industries’ capacity, the
close relationship between economic
welfare and national security, the impact

take account of the harmonized system
changes (2002, 2007, 2012 and 2017).
It took note of Jordan’s new export
subsidy programme for domestic
producers, in particular small and
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).
The Council also considered a draft
decision to derestrict additional
GATT negotiating material from tariff
negotiations which took place between
1947 and 1956. The derestricted
material includes records kept by the
WTO Secretariat on bilateral requests,
offers and agreements negotiated.
The decision contributes to the WTO’s
efforts to enhance transparency.

E-commerce
of foreign competition on domestic
suppliers, unemployment, government
revenue and loss of skills or investment.
China also raised more generic concerns
about the current trajectory of US trade
policies and their potential impact on
the global economy and international
trade. The US President’s Trade Policy
Agenda submitted to the US Congress
had sent “troubling” signals regarding
US international commitments and
obligations for safeguarding the authority
of the WTO’s dispute settlement
mechanism and US adherence to
progress on multilateralism, it said.
Three specific issues were addressed
by China: the US Seafood Import
Monitoring Programme; US abuse of
trade remedy measures; and US failure
to implement the obligation under Article
15 of China’s Accession Protocol to stop
using the “surrogate country” – thirdparty prices or costs – in calculating
anti-dumping margins in investigations.
These concerns had already been raised
by China in the Council and other WTO
bodies but had not been addressed by
the United States.

Many delegations
pointed to the benefits
that e-commerce
could provide to
developing countries
and SMEs.

The United States said WTO
agreements permit members to treat
China as a non-market economy for as
long as facts on the ground show this
to be so. Japan was also of the view that
WTO members are allowed to continue
disregarding Chinese prices as a basis
for anti-dumping calculations.

Waiver requests
The Council approved four collective
waiver requests extending deadlines
for updating WTO goods schedules to

Trade in goods
www.wto.org/goods

A significant number of delegations
pointed to the benefits and opportunities
that e-commerce could provide to
developing countries, least-developed
countries (LDCs) and SMEs by making
it easier for them to take part in global
trade. However, they also noted that
while the digital economy has developed
remarkably in recent years, there has
been only limited progress at the WTO
on the e-commerce work programme,
launched in 1998. E-commerce is also
discussed in the Council on Trade in
Services, the Trade-Related Intellectual
Property Rights Council and the
Committee on Trade and Development.
Other members reiterated that
trade facilitation and transparency
in e-commerce regulations could
be a good start for negotiations and
identified e-signatures, e-certification,
e-authentications and paperless trade
as areas where progress could be
made and where an outcome could
be achieved. In Buenos Aires, the
11th Ministerial Conference called on
members to “reinvigorate” discussions
on e-commerce and agreed to further
extend a moratorium on customs duties
on e-transmissions (see page 97).
Some members emphasized the
importance of maintaining discussions
on other aspects of e-commerce, such
as online trade in services, as well as
commitments for consumer protection,
data privacy and intellectual property
rights. Other members reiterated the
need to work on a “mapping” paper
identifying elements of substance
and position.

11 t h

The 11th Ministerial
Conference called
on members
to “reinvigorate”
discussions on
e-commerce.

Delegations from the African Group and
LDCs, as well as India, Cuba, Ecuador
and Bolivia, focused on the digital divide
or the stark differences in capacities
and supporting infrastructure among
members, which they said could lead to
uneven participation in e-commerce or
nullify any benefit to their micro, small
and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs).
Some delegations said it is premature
to discuss multilateral rule-making
in e-commerce while many poorer
members are not able to participate in
digital trade.
The Goods Council Chair, Ambassador
Choi Kyonglim (Korea), said there is
strong interest in e-commerce among
members and lauded the “very strong”
exchange of experiences, practices
and views. But he noted that
differences remain.

Transparency
At the request of New Zealand,
the Council discussed transparency
issues and considered at its session
on 10 November a proposal from the
United States on procedures to
enhance transparency and strengthen
notification requirements.

	

68

World Trade Organization  Annual Report 2018

Delegations stressed that transparency
is not only crucial for the work of the
WTO but is also a fundamental principle
of the multilateral trading system.
Some members suggested that the
Council hold discussions to identify
more accurately the reasons behind
the variable notification performance.
It was pointed out that notifications
of subsidies, import licensing and
quantitative restrictions are very low.
Members reaffirmed their readiness to
discuss how to enhance transparency
and help members, especially developing
countries and LDCs, comply with their
notification obligations.

Other issues
Australia invited members to an
information session on an initiative to
establish binding international rules
ensuring the duty-free temporary
admission of containers, pallets and
packing materials. Australia said this
initiative would reduce trade costs
and assist MSMEs.

Ma rket ac c e s s
•	 WTO members raised eight trade concerns at
the two formal meetings of the Committee.
•	 The Committee made progress in updating members’
schedules of commitments to reflect the latest
international tariff classification standards.
•	 Members agreed to derestrict a large number of
negotiating materials from the General Agreement
on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) era.
•	 The Committee received 11 notifications of quantitative
restrictions, down from 15 in 2016; it agreed to hold
a capacity-building workshop in spring 2018.

Background on
market access
The Committee on Market Access
supervises the implementation of
tariff and non-tariff commitments
not covered by any other WTO
body. In addition, it seeks to
ensure that members’ schedules
of concessions are up to date,
including changes required
to reflect amendments to the
harmonized system (HS). Without
this, it would be difficult to
compare members’ commitments
with the measures they apply
in practice. The HS, which is
administered by the World
Customs Organization, allows
countries to classify traded goods
on a common basis. It has been
updated five times since 1996.

Trade concerns

Harmonized System

WTO members raised eight trade
concerns. The European Union
considered that Angola’s consumption
tax discriminated against imports.
Similarly, Mexico and the European
Union saw Argentina’s law to promote
its auto-parts industry as discriminatory.
The European Union, Japan, Chinese
Taipei and the United States considered
that China’s tariffs on certain integrated
circuits exceed its bound duties. Japan
expressed concern over China’s import
tax on personal effects at the border.

The Committee continued its work to
ensure that WTO members’ schedules
of concessions reflect amendments
made by the World Customs
Organization to the Harmonized System
nomenclature, which take place every
four to five years.

Canada, the European Union, Japan,
Korea, Chinese Taipei and the United
States considered that India’s duties
on telecommunication products exceed
its bound duties and commitments
undertaken under the Information
Technology Agreement. Switzerland
expressed concern over the excise tax
levied by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia
on energy drinks and carbonated soft
drink products and over duties applied
by Oman on cigarettes. The European
Union considered that Russia’s tax on
wine is discriminatory because it treats
wines with a geographical indication
(GI) differently, and only some GIs
are recognized.

The amendments are typically referred
to by the year in which they enter into
force. They include HS96, HS2002,
HS2007, HS2012 and HS2017. These
“transposition” exercises help guarantee
that members’ schedules are up to date
and that tariff obligations are transparent,
allowing applied tariffs to be compared
with members’ WTO obligations.
The HS96, HS2002 and HS2007
exercises have been nearly concluded
for all members and the Committee
made good progress on HS2012 by
circulating for certification 52 files.
Work to update schedules to HS2017
has not yet begun. The Committee
agreed to extend four collective waivers
for the introduction of different versions
of the Harmonized System.

Implementation and monitoring

The WTO Secretariat issued an update
of its “Situation of schedules of WTO
members”, which lists all the legal
instruments relating to each member’s
schedule of commitments. It also
prepared a report on renegotiations
under GATT Article XXVIII on the
modification of members’ schedules,
which seeks to enhance transparency
and facilitate monitoring of the status
of such negotiations.

Databases
The WTO Secretariat reported on the
Integrated Data Base (IDB), which
provides information on applied tariffs
and import data as notified by WTO
members, and the Consolidated Tariff
Schedules (CTS) database, which
compiles information on the legal
obligations reflected in members’
schedules of commitments.
IDB data coverage has significantly
improved in recent years, but important
gaps remain. At present, insufficient
notifications mean that IDB data has
to be complemented with data coming
from other sources. The Secretariat
encouraged WTO members to notify the
relevant data and to reduce the gaps.

World Trade Organization  Annual Report 2018

Quantitative restrictions
The Committee received 11 notifications
of quantitative restrictions (QRs),
down from 15 in 2016, from Australia,
Canada, the European Union, Japan,
Kazakhstan, Mauritius, Nicaragua,
Singapore, Switzerland, the United
States and Uruguay.
Quantitative restrictions, a term
that refers to prohibitions and other
restrictions that do not take the form
of a tariff or a tax, are allowed in some
defined circumstances. Under the QR
notification decision, WTO members
must provide detailed information on
the prohibitions and restrictions they
maintain, including their justification
under WTO rules. The Secretariat
issued a report summarizing factual
Information on notifications received.
WTO members discussed how best
to improve the low number and quality
of these notifications and instructed the
Secretariat to update the practical guide
on quantitative restrictions, to review
the WTO webpage and the QR
database, and to organize a capacitybuilding workshop on QR notifications
in spring 2018.

Ag r ic u lt u re
•	 The Committee continued to express concern over WTO
members’ slow pace of notifications of trade measures.
•	 Members raised 199 questions about notifications,
the highest number in ten years.
•	 Australia became the first WTO member with
export subsidy entitlements to eliminate them
following the Nairobi decision.
•	 The WTO Secretariat organized two Geneva
workshops – one to strengthen the participation
of least-developed countries in Committee work
and the other on notification requirements.

The Committee on Agriculture reviewed
45 notifications of WTO members’
agricultural trade measures, and
members raised 199 questions, the
highest number for ten years. As in
previous years, the majority of these
questions were on members’ notified
domestic support (subsidy) measures.
Figure 1 gives a snapshot of the
proportion of questions on notifications
raised by subject area.

Background on agriculture
The Agreement on Agriculture
aims to reform trade and make
WTO members’ policies more
market-oriented. The rules and
commitments apply to market
access, domestic support and
export competition as well as export
restrictions and prohibitions.
The Committee on Agriculture,
meeting in regular session,
oversees the implementation of
the Agreement. The Committee
also monitors follow up to the
Marrakesh ministerial decision
regarding net food-importing
developing countries, which sets
out objectives on the provision
of food aid and other assistance.

Members raised questions about the
latest domestic support measures
notified by the United States and the
European Union for 2013 and 2014.
India responded to questions from
Australia on its minimum support price
for wheat. Once again, Canada’s milk
ingredients policy received much
attention from members.

Figure 1: Questions on
notifications raised in the
Committee on Agriculture
in 2017, by subject area

For the first time, the question of
Brexit – Britain’s planned exit from the
European Union – was discussed in
the Committee. Indonesia asked the
European Union to clarify how the United
Kingdom intends to allocate its tariff rate
quotas for agriculture products, and what
would be the procedure to grant the
generalized scheme of preferences to
developing countries. The United States,
Argentina, China and Russia signalled
their interest in this matter.

agricultural goods. The United States
asked Indonesia about a new regulation
that requires local milk processors to
procure local milk.
The review of WTO members’ progress
in implementing their subsidy and
market access commitments under the
Agriculture Agreement is largely based
on notified information. Article 18.6 of
the Agreement also allows members
to raise other matters relevant to the
implementation of commitments at any
time. In 2017, members posed 123 such
questions in the Committee, the secondhighest number in one year to date.
Figure 2 shows the annual proportion
of questions addressed to developed
and developing countries. Out of the
365 questions raised in 2017 (including
questions on individual notifications,
overdue notifications, Article 18.6
and questions raised under the
“other” category), 192 were directed
to developing countries. Developing
countries continued to be less active
than developed countries in posing
questions, asking just 25 in 2017.
Members again voiced specific concerns
about compliance with regular (annual)
notification obligations, particularly in
domestic support and export subsidies.
For the period 1995-2015, 35 per cent
of domestic support notifications
(765 notifications) and 33 per cent
of export subsidies notifications
(816 notifications) remained
outstanding as of October 2017.

Australia became the first WTO member
with export subsidies entitlements to
eliminate them from its WTO schedule of
commitments. In October, the European
Union became the second WTO
member to formally initiate the process of

Ministerial Decision to eliminate export
subsidies for developed countries.
Elimination takes effect three months
after the document outlining the changes
is circulated to members.

World Trade Organization  Annual Report 2018

The Committee held its annual dedicated
discussion on export competition, which
aims to enhance transparency and
improve monitoring. Export competition
covers export subsidies, export credits,
export credit guarantees or insurance
programmes, international food
aid and agricultural exporting state
trading enterprises.
The discussions were based on a WTO
Secretariat background document
compiling information provided
by WTO members on their export
competition policies. As an input to the
discussions, the Cairns Group of farm
goods exporters and Russia circulated
a paper considering the alignment
of members’ reported policies with
the disciplines agreed in the Nairobi
decision. During the meeting, members
exchanged questions and answers on
specific measures in relation to the
implementation of the decision.

Information exchange
A number of side events were organized
in the margins of Committee meetings.
An Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development (OECD)
seminar explored the policy influences
of participation in agricultural global
value chains. The International Food
Policy Research Institute launched a
book – Agriculture, Development and
the Global Trading System: 2000-2015
– and the UN Food and Agriculture
Organization organized an information
session on its food price monitoring
and analysis tool.

Workshops on agriculture
The WTO Secretariat organized two
Geneva-based workshops in 2017.
One was aimed at deepening leastdeveloped country (LDC) participants’
understanding of the rules of the
Agreement on Agriculture and enhancing
LDC members’ participation in the
Committee on Agriculture. A total of
28 government officials from 23 LDC
members attended.

Agriculture
www.wto.org/agriculture

The annual agriculture notification
workshop was held in March, providing
training to 25 capital-based officials
from developing countries. The training
covered the notification requirements
and formats of the Agreement on
Agriculture and the work of the
Committee. Participants were also
introduced to the new system for the
online submission of notifications,
which will improve both the efficiency
of processing the information and
the accuracy and consistency of data
reported. In addition, the system will
capture the data contained in the
notifications in a searchable format.

Transparency tools
The Committee’s work on monitoring
and transparency benefits from a
comprehensive database system –
the Agriculture Information Management

access to: (a) agriculture-related
information notified by members; and
(b) questions raised and responses
provided in the context of the
Committee’s review process.

Balanc e of
pay ment s
•	 The Committee concluded its consultations with
Ecuador following the country’s lifting of import
surcharges imposed for balance of payment reasons.

Background on
balance of payments
The Committee on Balanceof-Payments Restrictions is
responsible for the review of all
import restrictions applied by
WTO members for balance-ofpayments purposes. Under WTO
rules, measures can be taken to
safeguard a member’s external
financial position and (in the case
of developing countries) to ensure
a level of reserves adequate for the
implementation of programmes
of economic development. When
adopting balance-of-payments
measures, members must give
preference to those with the least
disruptive effect on trade.

On 16 June, Ecuador notified the WTO
that, as of 1 June 2017, it had removed all
the import surcharge measures imposed
in March 2015. In July, WTO members
welcomed the announcement and
agreed to conclude consultations
with Ecuador.
Ecuador imposed the surcharges in
March 2015, for 15 months, in response
to a sharp drop in oil prices starting in
late 2014, which led to a deterioration
in the country’s balance of payments.
The tariff surcharges were initially fixed
at between 5 per cent and 45 per cent
and were applied to nearly 3,000 tariff
lines, or 38 per cent of the country’s

	

74

World Trade Organization  Annual Report 2018

total. Following an earthquake in April
2016, Ecuador extended the surcharge
for one year, until June 2017.
WTO members facing balance-ofpayment difficulties may apply import
restrictions under provisions in the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
1994 and under the General Agreement
on Trade in Services. A member
applying new restrictions or substantially
intensifying existing ones is obliged to
consult with the Committee on Balanceof-Payments Restrictions. Members
were divided on whether Ecuador’s
application of the import surcharge
complied with WTO rules.

San ita r y and

mea s u re s
•	 The Committee considered a proposal to enhance
international standards on maximum pesticide residue
levels in food trade.
•	 Pesticides restrictions, which agri-exporters say can
be too stringent, featured prominently among trade
concerns raised.
•	 The Committee adopted the Fourth Review of the working
of the Sanitary and Phytosanitary (SPS) Measures
Agreement after a long delay.
•	 WTO members’ notifications of SPS measures reached
nearly 1,500 in 2017, with developing countries
accounting for 71 per cent.

Background on sanitary
and phytosanitary
measures
The Agreement on the Application
of Sanitary and Phytosanitary (SPS)
Measures establishes the rights
and obligations of WTO members
regarding measures taken to
ensure food safety, protect human
health from plant or animal-spread
diseases, protect plant and animal
health from pests and diseases,
or prevent other damage from pests.
Governments must ensure that
their SPS measures are necessary
for health protection and based on
scientific principles.

Pesticide residues
The Sanitary and Phytosanitary (SPS)
Committee considered a proposal
submitted by Kenya, Uganda and the
United States to enhance international
standards on maximum pesticide residue
levels (MRLs) in food trade, with greater
transparency and cooperation on the
development and application of MRLs.
Complying with different norms on
MRLs in different markets, or sometimes
the absence of such norms, for what
is permitted in or on food products to
ensure no risk to human health can be
a costly obstacle to trade, especially
for small enterprises and exporters in
developing countries.
The proponents urged members to
share information and experiences on
the development of MRLs on a voluntary
basis. The proposal was submitted as
a follow-up to a Committee-organized
workshop in October 2016 on MRLs. It
called, among other things, for regular
reports to the SPS Committee about
relevant international and regional
activities and discussion on the role
of the Committee in coordination and
harmonization of standards.

Sanitary and phytosanitary measures

Seventeen trade ministers issued
a statement at the 11th Ministerial
Conference in Buenos Aires highlighting
the importance of this work and
discussions are expected to continue
in the Committee.

Specific trade concerns
WTO members raised a range of specific
trade concerns on pesticides in food
products, which many agri-exporters
say are too stringent and impede trade,
especially to the detriment of farmers from
developing countries, at a Committee
meeting on 2-3 November which drew
a very high number of WTO members
and observers.
Among issues raised, Peru voiced
concerns, shared by others, over the
European Union’s MRLs for three
pesticides, one of which is commonly
used to control fungal infection in
mangoes. Argentina and the United
States took issue with delays in renewed
EU authorization for glyphosate, an
herbicide widely used for weed control.

Other new concerns raised over
the year included Viet Nam’s import
suspension of groundnut imports,
a proposed US rule to revoke pesticide
residue tolerances for chlorpyrifos,
a common insecticide used on
many agricultural crops, and India’s
fumigation requirements for cashew
nuts, teak wood and other products.
Concerns were also raised about a
Gulf Cooperation Council guide for
control of imported food and Brazilian
measures on bananas.
Previously raised concerns included
EU proposed criteria to define chemicals
that can interfere with hormone
systems – endocrine disruptors, the
US seafood monitoring programme
and the transparency of China’s food
safety measures.
In all, 17 new concerns were raised, and
many other previously raised concerns
were discussed again. Members informed
the Committee about the full or partial
resolution of 29 specific trade concerns,
compared with just two in 2016.
Of the 434 trade concerns raised since
1995, WTO members have reported
solutions for 166. A partial solution has
been reported for another 41, meaning
that not all members raising the concern

accepted the solution or that a solution
was found for only some of the products
at issue.
Altogether, about 50 per cent of the
specific trade concerns raised in the
SPS Committee since 1995 have been
either completely or partially resolved.
For the remaining half, WTO members
have not reported any solution.

Regionalization
Outbreaks of animal diseases lead to
many trade restrictions, and often these
restrictions are difficult to remove even
when the disease has been successfully
eradicated. Regionalization, or the
establishment of pest- or disease-free
areas, is a way to reduce the trade
impact of animal diseases.
The Committee held a thematic session
on regionalization in the animal health
area in July 2017, covering relevant
provisions of the SPS Agreement,
Committee guidelines and jurisprudence.
The Deputy Director-General of the
World Organisation for Animal Health
(OIE), Dr Matthew Stone, presented
OIE standards on regionalization and
WTO members shared experiences.
The Committee decided to hold a further
session, on pest-free areas for plants,
in early 2018.

The SPS Committee adopted the
report of the Fourth Review of the
Operation and Implementation of the
SPS Agreement in July. Adoption
has taken over three years due to
disagreement over a recommendation
that the Committee continue to consider
problems relating to private standards
on food safety, animal and plant health.
Members finally reached a compromise,
with wording suggesting they are unable
to agree on that recommendation.

Advance notice of changing SPS
requirements is crucial to avoid
unnecessary trade disruptions. The
Committee continued discussing a joint
proposal by Chile and the European
Union, which contains suggestions
on the notification of trade-facilitating
SPS measures, sharing of unofficial
translations of notified measures
and creating a central platform with
online access to WTO members’ final
SPS regulations.
The SPS Committee also held a
workshop on transparency in October.
The workshop included training on the
use of the improved SPS Information
Management System and the online

Sanitary and phytosanitary measures
www.wto.org/sps
	

Notification Submission System as well
as the ePing SPS/TBT notification alert
system. The workshop also provided a
forum for discussion and experiencesharing on national consultation
mechanisms for SPS regulations and
on other developments, challenges
and practices in the area of SPS
transparency.

Notifications by
developing countries
As Figure 4 shows, the total number
of SPS notifications has grown steadily,
contributing to improved transparency.
In 2017, members submitted 1,480
notifications. Of these, 924 were regular
notifications (down from 937 in 2016)
and 185 were emergency notifications
(up from 99 in 2016).
Notifications inform trading partners
of coming changes in the importing
member’s requirements and – unless
there is an urgent health protection
issue – provide a period during which
partners can comment before they enter
into force. When there is an urgent
health problem, members submit an
emergency notification immediately upon
the regulation’s entry into force.
In 2017, developing countries accounted
for 71 per cent of all SPS notifications
(up from 62 per cent in 2016, see Figure
5). Since 2008, developing countries
have submitted more than 50 per cent of
all notifications of new or changed food
safety, animal or plant health regulations
with an effect on international trade.
Two developing countries submitted
notifications for the first time – Rwanda
and Seychelles.

Background on technical
barriers to trade
The Technical Barriers to Trade
(TBT) Agreement aims to ensure
that regulations, standards, testing
and certification procedures
followed by WTO members do not
create unnecessary obstacles to
trade. The number of regulations
adopted by WTO members has
continued to grow in response
to consumers’ demands for
safe, high-quality products,
the protection of health and
the need to curb pollution and
environmental degradation.

Thematic sessions
The Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT)
Committee held three “thematic”
sessions to exchange information and
expertise on topics covered by the
TBT Agreement. The sessions
focused on conformity assessment
procedures, good regulatory practice
and risk assessment.
The TBT Agreement allows WTO
members to assess whether products
conform with their consumer safety,
health and environmental requirements
but these requirements must not restrict
trade unnecessarily and or discriminate
against other members. The International
Trade Centre (ITC) presented a survey
on non-tariff measures and conformity
assessment procedures, showing that
certification and testing are some of the
main barriers facing exporters worldwide.
Australia’s presentation explored whether
global conformity assessment systems
are fit for purpose, given the complexity
of global value chains. International
bodies, such as the International
Electrotechnical Commission, the
International Standards Organization
and the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development,
stressed the importance of common
international standards, guidelines
and recommendations.

World Trade Organization  Annual Report 2018

The session on good regulatory
practice featured presentations by
the Philippines, Canada, Korea and
the European Union. The Philippines
outlined various national and regional
initiatives and suggested that a capacitybuilding facility be established to help
institutionalize good regulatory practice
in developing countries.
On risk assessment, WTO members
highlighted the importance of aligning
certification practices with the nature
and level of risk posed by products.

Specific trade concerns
WTO members raised a record 177
specific trade concerns (see Figure 6).
Only 27 were new concerns, however,
substantially fewer than in recent years.
Concerns covered a wide range of
product regulations, including those
dealing with the consumption of alcohol,
food labelling (nutrition information,
origin information, etc.), toy safety,
medical devices, pharmaceutical
products, trade in solid waste, safety
of chemicals, the energy efficiency of
vehicles and, increasingly, information
technology (IT) products as well as
cybersecurity-related concerns.

In 2017, WTO members submitted
a record 2,587 notifications of new
(or changed) draft measures. Most
of these were submitted through the
WTO’s online portal, a system which
enables the WTO Secretariat to publish
notifications within two days of receipt.
The portal allows members to track
the status of submitted notifications
through a user interface and facilitates
the preparation of similar notifications
through the use of templates. For the
first time, an African and LDC member
(Uganda) was the most prolific notifying
member (see Figure 7).

Capacity building
Demand for TBT-related technical
assistance has increased in recent
years. In 2017, the WTO Secretariat
organized 31 training activities, including
two regional workshops and ten national
workshops. The activities were designed
to help participants expand their
understanding of the TBT Agreement,
discuss challenges in implementing the
Agreement and to learn more about
the work of the TBT Committee.

Observers
The TBT Committee received updates
from representatives of various observer
organizations on their latest activities,
including on technical assistance.

•	 The Committee reviewed WTO members’ notifications
of subsidies and countervailing duty legislation.
•	 Chairs alerted members to “chronic” low compliance
with notification obligation on subsidies.
•	 The Committee continued consideration of US
proposal on subsidy programmes not included
in members’ notifications.

Background on
subsidies and
countervailing measures
The Subsidies and Countervailing
Measures (SCM) Agreement
regulates WTO members’ use
of subsidies and countervailing
measures on subsidized imports
of a product found to be injuring
domestic producers of that
product. The SCM Committee
serves as a forum for members to
discuss the implementation of the
SCM Agreement and any matters
arising from this.

In 2017, the Subsidies and
Countervailing Measures (SCM)
Committee reviewed WTO members’
notifications of specific subsidies,
notifications of countervailing duty
legislation, semi‑annual reports of
countervailing actions and ad hoc
notifications of preliminary and final
countervailing measures taken.
At the spring meeting, Chair Jin-dong
Kim of Korea spoke of the “discouraging”
low compliance with the fundamental
transparency obligation to notify
subsidies, saying it constitutes a serious
problem for the proper functioning of the
SCM Agreement. His successor, Ieva
Baršauskaitê of Lithuania, returned to
the theme in the autumn, referring to
the “chronic low compliance”.
The Committee began its consideration
of 2017 new and full notifications and
continued reviewing previous ones.
It continued to discuss ways to improve
the timeliness and completeness of
notifications and other information flows
on trade measures. The Committee
again considered a proposal by the
United States on procedures for
questions and answers for subsidy
programmes not included in members’
notifications. It also discussed Australia’s
proposal regarding additional information
to be included in a WTO Secretariat
compendium on subsidy notifications.

Subsidies and countervailing measures
www.wto.org/scm
	

Both chairs urged developing countries
that had not yet made final notifications
of the elimination of their export subsidy
programmes to do so. Nineteen
developing countries had been given
a final two-year extension, to the end
of 2015, for the elimination of such
programmes, with final notifications
of removal due by end-June 2016.
The Committee reviewed four
notifications in 2017, which left
eight notifications outstanding.
Least-developed countries (LDCs) and
developing countries with a per capita
gross national income below US$ 1,000
a year, calculated in constant 1990
dollars, are exempt from the export
subsidy prohibition. Based on World
Bank calculations, 12 WTO members,
down from 14 the previous year, were
still in the latter category in 2017.
The Committee reviewed notifications of
countervailing actions taken (see Figure
8). As of 30 June 2017, there were 154
notified measures (definitive duties and
undertakings) in force, up from 126 the
year before.

•	 W
 TO members initiated 139 new anti-dumping
investigations from January to June 2017, slightly
down from 145 in the same period in 2016.
•	 I ndia and the United States were the leading initiators,
accounting for nearly half of the total.
•	 I nvestigations involving steel products continued
to dominate discussions in the Committee on AntiDumping Practices.

Background on antidumping practices
WTO members can apply “antidumping” measures on imports
of a product where the exporting
company exports the product
at a price lower than the price
it normally charges in its home
market and the dumped imports
cause or threaten to cause injury
to the domestic industry. The
Committee on Anti-Dumping
Practices provides WTO
members with the opportunity to
discuss any matters relating to the
Anti-Dumping Agreement.

Steel products
accounted for
more than

3 5%

of all new
anti-dumping
investigations.

India and the United States each
initiated 34 anti-dumping investigations
in the first six months of 2017. India’s
total was down from 48 in the previous
year, while US investigations increased
from 24. Australia, Brazil, Canada,
China, Turkey and Ukraine also initiated
more investigations than in 2016.
Other frequent users of anti-dumping
investigations, including Argentina, the
European Union, Chinese Taipei and
Pakistan, initiated fewer investigations.
After India and the United States,
the top initiators in 2017 were Australia
(12), China (9) and Canada (8)
(see Figure 9).
Investigations involving steel products
continued to dominate discussions in the
Committee on Anti-Dumping Practices.
Steel products accounted for more than
35 per cent of all new investigations.
Several members asserted a link
between overcapacity and high antidumping activity.
At its spring and autumn meetings,
the Committee reviewed semi-annual
reports for the second half of 2016
submitted by 44 WTO members and
semi-annual reports for the first half of
2017 submitted by 45 members. At the
October meeting, Committee Chair,
Faisal Saud Sulaiman Al-Nabhani of
Oman, noted that a “significant number”
of WTO members failed to submit semiannual reports for the first half of 2017.

The Committee reviewed new
notifications of legislation submitted
by Armenia, Brazil, El Salvador, the
European Union, India, Japan, Kyrgyz
Republic and New Zealand.
The Working Group on Implementation,
which serves as a forum for the exchange
of information on member practices,
held two meetings in 2017. Among the
issues discussed were: standards for
initiation of anti-dumping investigations;
ensuring effective participation in
investigations; analysis of price effects
of imports; and the methodology for
analysing imports made by firms in the
domestic industry. Some WTO members
made presentations or provided papers
describing their practices while other
members contributed to the discussions
with questions or comments.

The Committee also reviewed ad hoc
notifications of preliminary and final
actions taken by 31 and 30 WTO
members at the spring and autumn
meetings, respectively. As of 30 June
2017, 46 members had notified the
WTO of 1,675 anti-dumping measures
(definitive duties and undertakings) in
force, up from 1,598 the previous year.

Cu s tom s valuat ion
•	 Four WTO members notified the Committee of national
legislation but the overall record of notifications
remained poor.
•	 Despite broad support, the Committee did not agree
on Uruguay’s proposal on customs valuation of software
and data carriers.

Background on
customs valuation
The value of a good plays a
critical role in the calculation
of import duties and it is
indispensable for the calculation
of ad valorem duties, which
are the most common type of
duties applied. The WTO’s
Agreement on Customs Valuation
seeks to establish a fair, uniform
and neutral system for the
valuation of goods for customs
purposes, precluding the use
of arbitrary or fictitious values.
The Committee on Customs
Valuation manages this agreement
as well as the Agreement on
Pre-shipment Inspection.

In 2017, the Committee on Customs
Valuation continued reviewing the
implementation and administration of
the Customs Valuation Agreement. But
the low level of notifications of WTO
members’ national legislation continues
to hamper this work.
Notifications on customs valuation were
received from four members during
2017. As of the end of 2017, 98 WTO
members had notified their national
legislation, giving a compliance rate
of 72 per cent, and 66 members had
provided responses to the checklist
of issues related to their legislation,
a compliance rate of 49 per cent.
The Committee removed from its agenda
a long-standing item underlining the
importance of customs cooperation in
dealing with customs fraud. Members
agreed that the Trade Facilitation
Agreement, with its provisions on
customs cooperation, covered the issue.
Despite broad support, the Committee
did not reach consensus on Uruguay’s
long-standing proposal to amend the
Committee’s 30-year-old “Decision

Customs valuation
www.wto.org/customsvaluation
	

on the Valuation of Carrier Media
Bearing Software for Data Processing
Equipment” to ensure that software on
newer types of media carriers, such
as USB keys, is not treated differently
in customs valuations from software
imported using older types, such as
CDs or DVDs.
At the meeting of November 2017,
Canada raised a new concern
regarding Colombia’s use of reference
pricing for apparel.
The Committee concluded the review
of the national legislation of five members
– Cabo Verde, Colombia, Ecuador,
Montenegro and Nicaragua. It continued
its review of 13 others.

Pre-shipment inspection
In 2017, the Committee carried out
the fourth triennial review of the Preshipment Inspection (PSI) Agreement.
The key issues continued to be the

•	 The Committee examined how non-preferential rules of
origin affect trade.
•	 The Committee adopted new template for notifying origin
requirements in non-reciprocal trade preferences for
least-developed countries (LDCs).
•	 Several members submitted new notifications about
trade with LDCs, allowing the WTO Secretariat to study
preference utilization.
•	 The WTO launched a revised rules of origin website.

Background on
rules of origin
Rules of origin are the criteria
used to determine the country in
which a product is made. They
are used in the implementation
of many trade measures,
including trade statistics, the
determination of customs duties,
labelling of country of origin and
the application of anti-dumping
measures. The main objective of
the Agreement on Rules of Origin
is to harmonize the rules that all
WTO members use to determine
origin in their non-preferential
trade. This work is conducted
by the Committee on Rules of
Origin and is referred to as the
harmonization work programme.

Several members
informed the
Committee about
efforts to simplify
origin-related
requirements for
products from leastdeveloped countries.

Non-preferential
rules of origin
In 2017, the Committee on Rules of
Origin continued to examine the impact
that non-preferential rules of origin have
on international trade and businesses.
During an information session in March,
WTO members heard presentations
by the British Chamber of Commerce
and the United Nations Conference on
Trade and Development (UNCTAD)
on the importance of simplifying and, if
possible, harmonizing non-preferential
origin requirements.
Negotiations on rules of origin have been
stalled since 2007 and the Committee
has been holding so-called information
sessions as part of a transparency and
educational exercise that members
agreed to initiate in 2014. Building on
the various presentations made during
these information sessions, Switzerland
proposed the initiation of discussions
on possible “principles and guidelines”
on non-preferential rules of origin.
Consultations on this were conducted
throughout 2017.
Non-preferential rules of origin are
those which apply in the absence of
any trade preference – that is, when
trade is conducted on a most-favourednation (MFN) basis. Some trade policy
measures, such as quotas, anti-dumping
or “made in” labels, may require a
determination of the country of origin
and, therefore, the application of nonpreferential rules. Almost 50 WTO
members currently apply national rules
of origin for non-preferential purposes.

	

86

World Trade Organization  Annual Report 2018

A mandate for the negotiations was
included in the WTO’s Agreement on
Rules of Origin but talks were halted
by divergences on a number of “core
policy” issues.
The Chair of the Committee, Gerald
Pajuelo (Peru), acknowledged the
difficulties related to the harmonization
work programme but asked members to
identify other areas where technical work
would be useful. He invited members
to draw conclusions from presentations
made in the information sessions so that
concrete proposals could be considered.

Preferential rules of origin
The Committee moved forward with
implementing the 2013 Bali and
2015 Nairobi ministerial decisions on
preferential rules of origin for leastdeveloped countries (LDCs). Ministers
set out guidelines to make it easier for
LDC exports to qualify for preferential
market access.
In 2017, the Committee adopted a new
template for the notification of rules
of origin applying in non-reciprocal
trade preferences for LDCs. Several
members notified their requirements
using the template, which allowed
for greater comparability and a more
focused discussion by members. These
notifications will be gradually made
available through the WTO Preferential
Trade Agreements (PTA) database,
making such requirements easier to
access and understand. In addition,
Australia, Canada, China and Norway
informed the Committee about specific
efforts being made to simplify their
origin-related requirements.
Rules of origin

-----------------------Page 88 End-----------------------

Several members made new notifications
regarding their trade with LDCs,
strengthening the WTO tariff and trade
databases and allowing the WTO
Secretariat to prepare preliminary studies
on the utilization of trade preferences.
The objective of this work is to identify
preferential schemes or sectors where
utilization rates are low in order to
assess whether origin requirements
could be acting as a trade barrier. The
Committee agreed to continue working
in this area and instructed the Secretariat
to update its report and prepare other
disaggregated reports.

Least-developed
countries benefit from
guidelines designed
to make it easier for
their products to
qualify for preferential
market access.

Revised webpage
In June, the WTO launched a revised
version of its rules of origin webpages.
WTO members and the general public
can now directly access members’
legislation and practices related to rules
of origin. The revised webpage also
contains updated information on the
current work of the WTO’s Committee
on Rules of Origin.
Notifications received by the WTO
Secretariat regarding members’
preferential and non-preferential rules of
origin are now directly accessible via the
revised webpage (www.wto.org/origin).
The revised webpages also contain
new features, such as documents for
meetings, links to relevant disputes and
information on technical assistance.

•	 The Committee reviewed 66 notifications from WTO
members under the Agreement on Import Licensing
Procedures, down from 87 in 2016.
•	 S
 ix members submitted their first notifications;
Committee continued its work on improving transparency
and notification compliance.
•	 The Committee heard a number of specific trade
concerns about import licensing rules and procedures.
•	 The WTO Secretariat held first workshop in Geneva on
import licensing.

Background on
import licensing
The Agreement on Import
Licensing Procedures establishes
disciplines on WTO members’
import licensing systems, with
the principal objective of ensuring
that the procedures applied for
granting import licences do not
in themselves restrict trade.
The Agreement says import
licensing should be simple,
transparent and predictable,
and administered in a neutral
and non-discriminatory way.

30

30 WTO members
participated in
a workshop on
import licensing
procedures.

The Committee on Import Licensing
reviewed 13 notifications from 11
WTO members regarding publications
and/or legislation on import licensing
procedures and 22 notifications from
11 members relating to new import
licensing procedures or changes in
these procedures. It also reviewed 31
notifications from 26 members regarding
responses to a questionnaire on import
licensing procedures.
As of October 2017, 16 WTO members
had not submitted any notification under
the Agreement. In addition, 24 members
had never submitted responses to
the annual questionnaire on licensing
procedures. WTO trade monitoring
reports have identified import licensing
as one of the main trade-restricting
measures introduced by governments.
In 2017, six members submitted
notifications for the first time under
various provisions of the Agreement –
Brunei Darussalam, Kazakhstan,
South Africa, the Philippines, Togo and
Gabon. The Chair, Fawaz Almuballi
(Kingdom of Saudi Arabia), welcomed
revised notifications presented by
Mauritius and the Republic of Moldova,
containing comprehensive lists of
domestic regulations.

The low level of compliance with
transparency obligations has been the
main preoccupation of the Committee.
One informal meeting was held in
2017 on improving transparency and
streamlining notification procedures and
templates. Most members expressed
support for continuing the work on this.
The Committee provides a forum for
exchanging views on specific trade
issues. The United States reiterated
concerns about Indonesia’s import
licensing regime for cell phones,
handheld computers and tablets, about
India’s import licensing requirements
for boric acid and about Mexico’s steel
import licensing programme. Thailand
repeated its concerns about Indonesia’s
import licensing regime for tyres.
The European Union expressed
continued concerns about Brazil’s
regulatory requirements for nitrocellulose
imports and Russia expressed
disappointment about the European
Union’s import licensing system on steel.
Some members also expressed
concerns regarding China’s new import
restrictions for certain recoverable
materials and Indonesia’s import
requirements related to milk supply
and circulation.
A first Geneva-based workshop on
import licensing was organized by
the WTO Secretariat in May 2017.
Representatives from 30 members
participated in the workshop.

Safeg ua rd s
•	 New safeguard investigations fell to eight from 11 in 2016.
•	 WTO members imposed ten new measures, twice the
2016 number. More than half of the measures involved
steel or aluminium.
•	 Members urged caution in use of safeguards.

The number of new investigations
initiated during 2017 fell for the third
year running to eight from 11 in 2016
(see Figure 11). Investigations were
initiated by India, the Cooperation
Council for the Arab States of the Gulf
(GCC) member countries, Turkey (two),
Ukraine, the United States (two) and
Viet Nam. The last time the United States
initiated an investigation was in 2001.

Background on safeguards
WTO members may take safeguard
actions (temporarily restrict imports
of a product) to protect a specific
domestic industry from an increase
in imports of any product that is
causing, or threatening to cause,
serious injury to the industry.
In these circumstances, they have
the right to restrict imports of the
product from all sources (but not
from a specific member or group
of members). The Agreement
on Safeguards provides rules
concerning the investigation
that must be conducted and the
application of safeguard measures.
During an investigation, importers,
exporters and other interested
parties may present evidence,
give their views and respond to
the presentations of other parties.

WTO members imposed ten new
safeguard measures, twice as many
as in 2016. The countries that imposed
final measures were China, GCC
member countries, Jordan, Malaysia
(two), Morocco, South Africa, Thailand,
Turkey and Viet Nam.
Seven of the ten measures imposed in
2017 involved metals, specifically steel
and aluminium, but none of the new
investigations did.
Many members called for caution
in the use of safeguard measures.
They reminded the Committee that
safeguards, unlike anti-dumping and
countervailing duties, target exports
that are not violating any WTO rules.

•	 T
 he TRIMs Committee heard three new concerns
covering local content requirements in Nigeria,
Indonesia and Turkey.
•	 The Committee continued to discuss a number
of concerns raised in previous years.

Background on
trade-related
investment measures
The TRIMs Agreement recognizes
that certain investment measures
can restrict and distort trade.
It states that WTO members
may not apply any traderelated investment measure
that discriminates against
foreign products or that leads
to quantitative restrictions,
both of which violate basic
WTO principles. A list of
prohibited TRIMs, such as local
content requirements, is part
of the Agreement. The TRIMs
Committee monitors the
implementation of the Agreement
and allows members to consult
on any relevant matters.

The TRIMs Committee heard concerns
about three new investment measures
at its two meetings in 2017, all
concerning alleged local content
requirements, which stipulate that at
least part of a good or service should
be locally produced.
The first measure, discussed at the
request of Canada and the United
States, concerns guidelines on domestic
content in information communications
technologies adopted by Nigeria.
The second, discussed at the request
of the United States, refers to
requirements adopted by Indonesia
for dairy importation and distribution.
The third, discussed at the request of
the European Union and the United
States, relates to Turkey’s policy in
the pharmaceutical sector.
The Committee continued to discuss
measures that were raised in previous

years. These included measures
adopted by Argentina in its auto parts
industry and by China covering the
use of technology by companies in
the insurance industry. A number
of Indonesian measures have been
questioned, including the Industry Law
and Trade Law, as well as requirements
in the telecommunications sector, the
energy sector and the retail sector.
Members again raised concerns about
the implementation of Russia’s import
substitution policy.
The Committee took note of one new
notification submitted by Malawi under
Article 6.2 of the TRIMs Agreement,
which requires WTO members to notify
the Committee of all publications in
which TRIMs may be found, including
those applied by regional and local
governments and authorities within
their territory.

Ag re ement
•	 The WTO marked 20th anniversary of the Information
Technology Agreement (ITA) with symposium and
publication highlighting its achievements.
•	 DG Azevêdo said ITA shows how WTO members
can work together in different formats to overcome
obstacles to trade.
•	 Georgia joined the ITA expansion agreement, taking
participants to 26.

Background on
the Information
Technology Agreement
The ITA was agreed in December
1996 in Singapore. The plurilateral
agreement requires participants
to eliminate duties on IT products
on a most-favoured nation
basis. The ITA covers a large
number of high-technology
products, including computers,
telecommunications equipment,
semiconductors, software and
scientific instruments. The
Committee of the Participants
on the Expansion of Trade in
Information Technology Products
oversees the Agreement.

To mark the 20th anniversary of the ITA,
the WTO organized a symposium and
launched a publication. The symposium
took place in June with the participation
of the private sector, industry
representatives and academic experts.
The symposium provided an overview
of trade opening under the ITA and the
evolution of global trade in information
and communication technology (ICT)
products over the past 20 years.
It examined how ICT, as a development
tool, can help developing countries and
small and medium-sized enterprises
in improving connectivity and can
enable diversification, technology
upgrading and innovation.

The publication 20 Years of the
Information Technology Agreement:
Boosting trade, innovation and digital
connectivity describes the evolution
of the ITA and the significant impact
it has had on trade in IT products.
“In addition to the significant economic
impact, the success of the ITA is
notable because of what it says about
the WTO. It shows that members can
work together – in different formats –
to tackle the obstacles that they face
and bring solutions to the table. I think
there are important lessons to learn
from this deal,” said Director-General
Roberto Azevêdo.

The ITA shows
members can work
together – in different
formats – to bring
solutions to the table.

WTO marks 20 years
of the Information
Technology Agreement.

The publication charts how ITA exports
have more than tripled in value over the
past 20 years and now represent 15
per cent of total merchandise products,
exceeding the shares of automotive
products, textiles and clothing and
pharmaceuticals. The publication
underlines how the lower cost and
greater availability of computers and
mobile phones has resulted in increased
access to the internet and the growth
of the digital economy, creating new
opportunities for trade.

Product classification
divergences
ITA exports have more
than tripled in value
over the past 20 years.

The Committee continued its work
on divergences in classification of
“Attachment B” products, in an effort
to further reduce the number of ITA
products without an agreed HS2007
customs classification code (see page
69). Attachment B products refers to
a list of items attached to the 1996
Ministerial Declaration and for which
there was no agreed tariff classification.

Non-tariff measures
An informal group of members, led
by Switzerland, has been looking at
issues such as conformity assessment,
transparency and electronic labelling.
On conformity assessment, the
group discussed a mapping exercise

	

92

World Trade Organization  Annual Report 2018

covering the areas of electromagnetic
compatibility, electrical safety, radio
equipment and environmental standards.
On transparency, exploratory discussions
have begun on ways to improve
notifications. On electronic labelling,
members exchanged information
regarding their current practices
and regulations.

Expansion of the ITA
Reporting on behalf of the ITA expansion
group, Canada said that participants
continued to implement tariff reduction
commitments with respect to the 201
IT products covered by the landmark
expansion deal, reached in 2015.
The expansion of the ITA, to include
more products, such as integrated
circuits and touch screens, was the first
major tariff-cutting agreement at the
WTO since 1996.
All ITA expansion participants, except
Albania, have submitted modified tariff
schedules of commitments. The cuts
will be applied on a most-favourednation basis, which means that all
WTO members benefit from duty‑free
access in these markets. Georgia
joined the group, bringing the number of
participants to 26, representing 55 WTO
members, including developed and
developing countries, and accounting for
approximately 90 per cent of world trade
in these products.

•	 The Working Party reviewed new and full notifications
by 16 WTO members.
•	 Compliance with notification obligations remained poor.

Background on state
trading enterprises
State trading enterprises are defined
as governmental or non-governmental
enterprises, including marketing
boards, which have been granted
exclusive or special rights or privileges
to deal with goods for export and/
or import. They are required to act
in a manner consistent with the
WTO principle of non‑discriminatory
treatment. The Working Party on
State Trading Enterprises reviews
notifications by WTO members of
their state trading activities.

At its May and November meetings,
the Working Party on State Trading
Enterprises (STEs) reviewed the
2016 new and full notifications by
16 members regarding the activities
of their STEs and asked questions
about specific aspects of notifications
made at previous meetings.

Compliance with notification obligations
remained poor. For the 2016 notification
period (covering 2014 and 2015),
only 45 new and full notifications
were received out of a total of 136
WTO members subject to this obligation.
Members were encouraged by the
working party to continue to work
with their respective capitals and the
WTO Secretariat to improve their
notification record.

•	 The landmark Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA)
entered into force in February 2017.
•	 I mplementation of the Agreement is making good
headway and TFA acceptances reached almost
80 per cent of the WTO membership.
•	 The Trade Facilitation Committee started work under
its first Chair.
•	 Effective trade facilitation is seen as requiring good
cooperation between government agencies and the
private sector.

Background on
trade facilitation
Negotiations on the Trade
Facilitation Agreement were
successfully concluded in
December 2013 at the WTO’s
Ninth Ministerial Conference.
The Agreement entered into force
in February 2017 after two-thirds
of members had ratified it. The
Agreement aims to expedite the
movement, release and clearance
of goods, including goods in transit.
It establishes measures for effective
cooperation between customs
and other appropriate authorities
on trade facilitation and customs
compliance issues. The Agreement
also contains provisions for
technical assistance and capacity
building. The Committee on Trade
Facilitation oversees the Agreement.

The landmark Trade Facilitation
Agreement (TFA) entered into force on
22 February 2017 after acceptances
of the required two-thirds of WTO
members were received. Acceptances
had risen to 128 by the end of January
2018, meaning that more than threequarters (77 per cent) of all WTO
members had completed their domestic
ratification processes.
By expediting the movement, release
and clearance of goods across borders,
the TFA will have a significant economic
impact, potentially reducing trade costs
globally by an average of 14.3 per cent.
These economic gains would be bigger
than the elimination of all existing tariffs
around the world, with the poorest
countries benefiting most. Furthermore,
and for the first time at the WTO, the
requirement to implement an agreement
is directly linked to a member’s capacity
to do so.

World Trade Organization  Annual Report 2018

Good progress has been made
on notifications, with a total of 62
related submissions received in 2017.
The majority consisted of category
notifications, a key element of the
flexibilities granted to developing
and least-developed countries. Many
submissions specified when members
will be able to implement the Agreement
and shared information on required
capacity-building support.
Members will implement the TFA
provisions in accordance with the
categories (A, B or C) in which they have
designated their commitments. Category
A covers TFA commitments members
promised to implement on entry into
force; Category B covers those that a
developing or least-developed country
will implement after a transitional period;
and Category C covers commitments
requiring technical assistance and
capacity building to implement.

Developed countries had to implement
all provisions immediately.

In doing so, we are testimony of what can
be achieved – even under challenging
circumstances – when working in
coalitions of a common cause.”

Donor members provided information
on their assistance for capacity-building
activities, beneficiaries and implementing
agencies. Information was also provided
on contact points in responsible
agencies as well as on the process
for requesting support. Members also
provided a series of transparency
notifications mandated by the TFA.
These submissions cover publication
aspects, single-window operations,
use of customs brokers and customs
cooperation. All notifications can be
accessed via the TFA database
(www.tfadatabase.org).

Inaugural session
The Trade Facilitation Committee,
which oversees the TFA, held its
inaugural session in May 2017 and
elected Ambassador Daniel Blockert of
Sweden as its first Chair. The Committee
conducted additional sessions in July
and November, discussing matters such
as rules of procedure, notifications,
ratifications and technical assistance.
Members also shared experiences with
respect to the implementation of the
TFA Agreement.
“Having the committee now in session
marks an important milestone in our
longstanding efforts to foster the
facilitation of trade around the globe,”
Ambassador Blockert told the first
meeting. “We have finally reached the
stage where our collective engagement
over the past years is bearing fruit.

Related events
A special event was held at the WTO
in June to celebrate the Agreement’s
entry into force and to look at the road
ahead. In a video message, DirectorGeneral Roberto Azevêdo described the
TFA as a “ground-breaking” deal which
represented “the greatest trade reform
for a generation”. DG Azevêdo declared:
“As the first multilateral deal since the
WTO was created in 1995, the TFA
demonstrated beyond doubt that the
WTO can deliver.”
The one-day event – “The WTO
Agreement on Trade Facilitation: from
vision to reality – and to the future” –
brought together negotiators involved
in reaching the historic deal and trade
experts to reflect on how the accord was
forged and what it means for the future.
Also in June, the WTO issued a
publication – National Committees on
Trade Facilitation: Current Practices
and Challenges – providing information
on national experiences, best practices
and recommendations with respect to
the establishment and functioning of
national committees. It reported that
many WTO members have set up these
national bodies for coordinating the
implementation of the Agreement and
would like assistance to ensure their
effective functioning.

A special event at
the WTO celebrated
the TFA’s entry into
force and looked at
the road ahead.

Trade facilitation can be a key contributor
to sustainable development as speedier
border crossings for goods and services
help address poverty alleviation and
even humanitarian crises, speakers at
various sessions told the Aid for Trade
Global Review in July. Coordination
among customs authorities and other
government agencies in a country is
important, as are partnerships with
the private sector, speakers said.
“The difficult part is not necessarily
technology. It’s the coordination between
many government agencies so we can
realize coordinated border management,”
World Customs Organization SecretaryGeneral Kunio Mikuriya said.
On the margins of the 11th Ministerial
Conference in Buenos Aires, public
and private sector leaders exchanged
insights on implementing the TFA to
fully reap the benefits of swifter and
less costly trade at the border. Speakers
at the event, entitled “Trade Facilitation
on Track”, highlighted the importance
of local ownership of reform plans,
multi-stakeholder cooperation and
capacity building.

Trade Facilitation
Agreement Facility
Through national and regional
workshops, the Trade Facilitation
Agreement Facility (TFAF) continued

	

96

World Trade Organization  Annual Report 2018

in 2017 to help WTO members prepare
for ratification of the TFA and submit
notifications to allow them to
benefit from flexibilities in
implementing the Agreement.
While funding is an important element
of the Facility, its core purpose is to help
WTO members access the support
they need through existing projects
offered by bilateral donors as well as by
international and regional organizations
and the private sector. It is funded by
WTO members on a voluntary basis.
Launched in 2014, the TFAF provides an
information-sharing platform to provide
resources, identify possible donors
and undertake donor and recipient
match-making activities. It will also
provide project preparation and project
implementation grants in cases where
efforts to attract funding from other
sources have failed.
The TFAF organized two courses
aimed at helping the chairs of national
trade facilitation committees to
better understand the role of the
committees and to increase their
understanding of the Agreement.
The Facility held meetings with
partner organizations/donors to
enhance coordination of support for
implementation of the Agreement.

agreed in 2011, enables WTO members
to grant more favourable treatment to
LDC services and service suppliers.

The General Agreement on
Trade in Services (GATS)
defines trade in services in terms
of four types of transactions:
mode 1 – cross-border supply
(a supplier in one WTO member
provides services to a consumer
in another member’s territory);
mode 2 – consumption abroad
(a consumer from one member
consumes services in another
member’s territory); mode 3 –
commercial presence (a foreign
company provides services through
establishment in another member’s
territory); and mode 4 – presence of
natural persons (individuals move to
supply services in another member’s
territory). The Council for Trade in
Services oversees the operation of
the GATS.

The 24 notifications of preferential
treatment to LDC services and service
suppliers (counting EU member states
as one) are from: Canada, Australia,
Norway, Korea, China, Hong Kong
(China), Chinese Taipei, Singapore,
New Zealand, Switzerland, Japan,
Mexico, Turkey, the United States, India,
Chile, Iceland, Brazil, the European
Union, Liechtenstein, South Africa,
Uruguay, Thailand and Panama.
LDCs provided detailed assessments
of the preferences granted to them.
Declaring the waiver a success, LDCs
called for targeted capacity-building
measures to enable their suppliers
to utilize the preferences. They urged
members to raise awareness of
the waiver among their respective
constituencies. They also called on the
Services Council to explore ways to
enhance the functioning of the waiver.

Exemptions to the
MFN obligation
The Council concluded its fourth review
of the exemptions that many WTO
members took from the most-favoured
nation (MFN) obligation on joining the
WTO. The review examines whether
the conditions that gave rise to the
exemptions still existed. The Council
agreed to set the date of the next review
at its first meeting of 2022.

WTO members submitted various
communications on e-commerce,
generating a high level of engagement.
Numerous delegations emphasized
the transformative role of e-commerce,
its positive impact on growth and
development and its potential to
reduce transaction costs, especially
for the smallest enterprises. A number
of members also shared information
about their e-commerce domestic legal
frameworks, the commercial and regulatory
evolution of relevant sectors, such as
e-payment and courier services, and
their experience with negotiating related
provisions in regional trade agreements.
Numerous members signalled their
readiness to work towards an outcome
on e-commerce at the 11th Ministerial
Conference (MC11) in Buenos Aires.
Various delegations called for a gradual
approach focused initially on areas
that enhance consumer and business
confidence with electronic transactions.
Several members, however, argued
against any WTO rule-making on
e-commerce. They stated that some of the
communications tabled went beyond the
purely exploratory mandate for the work
and that a number of the issues raised did
not belong in the WTO. These delegations
also underscored the need to put
developing and least-developed countries
(LDCs) at the centre of the debate.
MC11 extended a moratorium
on customs duties on electronic
transmissions for a further two years until
the next ministerial session. Ministers
also issued a call to “reinvigorate” work
on e-commerce (see page 32).

Numerous delegations

WTO members could not agree on the
organizing of a seminar on the movement
of natural persons (mode 4), which
covers the temporary movement of
people (rather than companies) across
borders to supply services, initially
proposed by India in 2016. Nevertheless,
India underscored its intention to have
the Council continue discussing the
seminar proposal.
In October, Japan and the United States
expressed concerns about cybersecurity
measures China recently adopted or is
developing, and about measures that
Viet Nam is developing. The European
Union, New Zealand, Australia and
Chinese Taipei echoed many of the
concerns, and India and Brazil also
intervened. Both China and Viet Nam
provided a number of clarifications and
stressed their right to regulate in pursuit
of relevant public policy objectives.
Russia again raised the reform of the
Unified Gas Transportation System
of Ukraine.
In accordance with the transparency
provisions of the General Agreement
on Trade in Services (GATS), the
Council received 18 notifications of
new or revised measures that could
significantly affect trade in sectors
where the notifying WTO members
have commitments. Another seven
notifications dealt with new economic
integration agreements covering
services trade.

Financial services
The Committee on Trade in Financial
Services addressed electronic payments
in discussions on the contribution
of trade in financial services to
financial inclusion. China provided an
overview of recent developments in
its electronic payments sector. The
Friends of E-commerce for Development
(Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Costa
Rica, Kenya, Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan,
Sri Lanka and Uruguay) organized
a seminar on digital payments and
financial inclusion, held at the WTO
in March 2017.
Under the Committee’s ongoing review
of global financial regulatory reform,
the Committee on Payments and Market
Infrastructures, the Financial Stability
Board and the International Association
of Insurance Supervisors made
presentations on recent developments
and discussed with members the
potential implications for trade in
financial services.
Jamaica, on behalf of the members of the
Caribbean Community, submitted a draft
proposal for a seminar on “de-risking and
correspondent banking”. Consultations
on this proposal are continuing.

Specific commitments
China raised two issues at the sole
meeting of the Committee on Specific
Commitments. It challenged the view
that discussion on “new services” –
those that appear not to be specifically
mentioned in the GATS classification
system – has been exhausted.

Trade in services
www.wto.org/services

-----------------------Page 100 End-----------------------

According to China, the complexity
of the subject and its direct relevance
to the implementation of specific
commitments by members warrant
further in-depth examination on related
issues in the Committee.
China also drew attention to a distinction
between the terms “e-commerce” and
“digital trade”. In China’s view, the
interchangeable use of those two terms
might cause misunderstanding and
confusion in future work on e-commerce
in the WTO.
Members differed on whether to
continue the discussion on “new
services” and on the need to draw a
distinction between “e-commerce”
and “digital trade”.

With regard to discussion of economic
needs tests (ENTs), Turkey said that
the problems that it had sought to
address with its proposals, i.e. lack of
clarity, transparency and predictability,
are covered in the Trade Facilitation in
Services Agreement proposed by India
(see page 52). Turkey suggested that
future work on ENTs, which condition
market access to fulfilment of certain
economic criteria pursuant to GATS
Article XVI, focus on the acceptability
and formulation of Article 5 of the
proposed agreement.
Turkey’s suggestion was supported
by India and Brazil. The Committee
did not decide whether and how it
should continue with its work on ENTs.
A major problem with ENTs is that most
relevant entries in members’ schedules
of commitments provide no or minimal
indication as to the criteria applied.

•	 TRIPS amendment on affordable medicines came
into force in January 2017.
•	 WTO members called for action to ensure the amendment
can be used effectively.
•	 Twelve members notified the TRIPS Council of new
or revised IP legislation.
•	 The Secretariat focused technical assistance on
effective use of the amendment and its implementation
in domestic legislation.

Background on TRIPS

Public health

The intellectual property system
has become central to debate
about economic development
and broader public policy
questions, such as innovation
policy and public health. The
TRIPS Agreement is the most
comprehensive international
treaty governing the protection,
administration and enforcement
of intellectual property rights.
The Council for TRIPS, a body
open to all WTO members and
to certain observers, administers
the TRIPS Agreement, provides
a forum for debate on policy
issues and reviews the intellectual
property legislation of individual
WTO members.

On 23 January 2017, an amendment
to the TRIPS Agreement came into
force ensuring developing countries
legal access to affordable medicines
under WTO rules. It is the first time
a multilateral WTO accord has been
amended. The amendment became
part of the WTO rule book after it was
formally accepted by the necessary
two-thirds of WTO members. It makes a
special compulsory licensing system for
affordable medicines a permanent part of
the TRIPS Agreement.
“The amendment provides a secure legal
pathway to access affordable medicines
and puts this new procurement tool on a
par with other TRIPS flexibilities directly
relevant to public health,” said the Chair
of the TRIPS Council, Ambassador
Modest Jonathan Mero of Tanzania.
WTO members called for action to
ensure that the system can be used
effectively to deliver affordable medicines
to countries in need. Possible actions
proposed include awareness-raising
among procurement and intellectual
property (IP) officials on how to use the

	

100

World Trade Organization  Annual Report 2018

system as a practical procurement tool,
providing legislative and other assistance
to countries to implement it in domestic
law, and sharing of national experiences.
In response, the WTO Secretariat
made a presentation on notification
requirements and increased its existing
focus on practical use of the system in its
long-running series of capacity-building
activities focusing on TRIPS and public
health. For the first time, it organized a
training activity tailored for a particular
region – Latin America – on trade and
public health with a particular focus on
the use of the system across that region.
The General Council extended the
period for acceptance of the amendment
from the end of 2017 to December 2019
as 43 members had not yet provided
acceptances. Those members will
continue to benefit from a 2003 waiver
granting access to affordable medicines
from third-country sources.
TRIPS and public health continued
to be addressed in various technical
cooperation activities organized by the
WTO Secretariat in collaboration with
the World Health Organization,

Trade-related aspects of intellectual property rights (TRIPS)

-----------------------Page 102 End-----------------------

Amendment to the TRIPS Agreement – Entry into force
The amendment eases poorer WTO
members’ access to medicines
by allowing generic versions of
patented medicines to be produced
under compulsory licences (i.e.
without the consent of the patent
owner) exclusively for export to
countries that cannot manufacture
the needed medicines themselves.
The amendment entered into force
on 23 January 2017.

The amendment
provides a secure legal
pathway to access
affordable medicines.

Four things you need
to know about the
TRIPS amendment:

3. Compulsory
licence system

1. Public health concerns
The amendment is entirely driven
by public health concerns. African
countries played a major role in
bringing about this change.

2. Patience pays off

The compulsory licence system for
the export of medicines has been
used once so far. A Canadian
company exported HIV/AIDS
medicine to Rwanda in 2008 and
2009. Efforts to ensure that the
amendment can work effectively
and deliver concrete results are
under way.

Law-making can sometimes be
slow but patience pays off. WTO
members first agreed to ease access
to generic medicines for countries
lacking production capacity in
2003. Two years later, this decision
was transformed into a permanent
amendment to the WTO’s IP rules.
The amendment finally entered into
force in 2017 after two-thirds of
WTO members had accepted it.

4. Acceptance threshold

the World Intellectual Property
Organization (WIPO) and with other
multilateral partners. The annual WTO
workshop on trade and public health
was held in Geneva in November and
covered a wide range of trade and IP
issues as they relate to public health,
along with other perspectives, such as
procurement strategies and the human
rights dimension.

At the Council’s meetings, several
delegations provided additional
explanations about the significance of
the notified legislation. The Council was
also briefed on the wide range of IP
policy matters members had raised in
other members’ trade policy reviews.

Promoting transparency
TRIPS notifications provide a unique
body of information and are an important
transparency mechanism on how
members have adapted and applied
general TRIPS standards in distinct ways
that correspond to the domestic needs
and circumstances.
In 2017, 12 members notified the Council
of new or revised IP legislation. To date,
134 WTO members have notified their
TRIPS implementing legislation, 110
have provided responses to a checklist
notifying the essential elements of their
systems for enforcement of IP rights
and 141 members have notified contact
points for cooperating with each other on
eliminating trade in IP-infringing goods.

Trade-related aspects of intellectual property rights (TRIPS)
www.wto.org/trips
	

The amendment came into force
once Burkina Faso, Liechtenstein,
Nigeria, the United Arab Emirates
and Viet Nam submitted their
instruments of acceptance in
January 2017, bringing the total
number of acceptances over the
required threshold of two-thirds of
the WTO membership; this follows
a recent sharp increase in the rate
of acceptances filed.

In the Council’s meeting of October
2017, India posed questions to the
European Union concerning its
legislation on customs enforcement for
goods in transit. The European Union
indicated its willingness to engage in
talks with members concerned.
Based on the notifications received,
the Council completed reviews of TRIPS
implementing legislation of Saint Kitts
and Nevis, Seychelles and Kazakhstan.
The Council was regularly updated on
the WTO Secretariat’s work on the
e-TRIPS project. This project aims to
streamline arrangements for submitting
and managing notifications and for
developing an on-line information service
to improve the accessibility of materials
relating to the TRIPS Council’s work.

Plants, animals, biodiversity
and traditional knowledge

Incentives for
technology transfer

The Council continued its discussion
on the patentability of plant and animal
inventions, the relationship between the
TRIPS Agreement and the Convention
on Biological Diversity (CBD) and the
protection of traditional knowledge
and folklore.

In October 2017, the Council
undertook the 15th annual review of
reports provided by developed countries
on the incentives they give to promote
and encourage the transfer of technology
to least-developed countries (LDCs).
The TRIPS Agreement, in Article 66.2,
requires developed countries to provide
such incentives.

Members’ positions remained
unchanged on two substantive
questions: whether the TRIPS
Agreement should be amended to
prohibit the patentability of life forms;
and whether – and, if so, how – TRIPS
should do more to promote the CBD
objectives of authorized access and
equitable sharing of the benefits from
the use of genetic resources and
associated traditional knowledge in
other WTO members’ jurisdictions.

WTO members
welcomed the entry
into force of the TRIPS
amendment to ease
access to medicines.

Views diverge on whether to amend
the TRIPS Agreement to oblige WTO
members to require patent applicants
to disclose the source or the country
providing genetic resources and
associated traditional knowledge
where the invention is based on
such resources or knowledge.

The WTO Secretariat organized the 10th
annual workshop aimed at strengthening
dialogue on and understanding of
the incentives and on the process
of reporting them. The LDC Group
indicated that LDCs still trail developed
and developing countries in technology
and that transfer of technology, as
required by Article 66.2, would increase
LDCs’ prospects of developing local
research institutions and the appropriate
technology to bridge the gap and to
meet UN Sustainable Development
Goals (SDGs).

TRIPS non-violation and
situation complaints
In 2017, the TRIPS Council continued
its discussion on the application of
so-called non-violation and situation
complaints under the TRIPS Agreement,
in particular on whether such disputes
should be permitted, whether there
is a need to establish the scope and
ground rules (modalities) for such
complaints and whose task it would
be to propose possible elements for
the scope and modalities.
In general, WTO disputes can be
brought not only if an agreement or
commitment has been violated but also
if an expected benefit under an
agreement has been nullified, even
without any violation of the letter of
the agreement. However, the TRIPS
Agreement contained a five-year
moratorium on initiating such “nonviolation and situation complaints”.
This moratorium has been repeatedly
extended by ministerial conferences.
At the 11th Ministerial Conference in
Buenos Aires, in the absence of a final
agreement on this question, ministers
directed the Council to continue its
examination of the scope and modalities
for these complaints and make
recommendations to the next
Ministerial Conference in 2019.

Technical cooperation
and capacity building

IP and the public interest

The Council was updated on technical
cooperation by developed countries,
other intergovernmental organizations
and the WTO Secretariat. The
Secretariat focused its technical
assistance on effective use of the
TRIPS amendment on affordable
medicines and its implementation
in domestic legislation.

The WTO Secretariat
focused its technical
assistance on
effective use of the
TRIPS amendment on
affordable medicines.

The WTO and WIPO again jointly
delivered two advanced technical
assistance courses for government
officials and university teachers,
in March and June in Geneva. The
aim is to strengthen the capacity of
developing-country participants to
monitor and participate in international
IP developments and to make informed
assessments of IP policy issues.
In December, the Secretariat organized
the first WTO specialized programme
on the TRIPS Agreement and national
judiciaries, which aimed to enhance the
capacity of the judiciary on the policy
and practice of disputes and other
litigation on IP matters, particularly
those elements covered by the TRIPS
Agreement. It was attended by some 30
judges from developing countries and
economies in transition who are currently
dealing with IP matters.

IP and innovation
The Council continued its discussion
and information exchange on IP and
innovation, focusing on how IP protection
can play a critical role in boosting
collaboration-based innovation and
competitiveness in small business; how
IP frameworks and innovation policy
assist micro, small and medium-sized
enterprises (MSMEs) to successfully
grow and help them integrate into
global value chains.

WTO members discussed the
relationship between IP and the public
interest, with a focus on compulsory
licensing. Sponsors indicated a need
to broaden understanding of how
IP systems can be responsive to
public interest considerations. While
recognizing the need for balanced IP
systems, some other members indicated
that IPRs do not contradict the public
interest. In their view, IP systems
contribute to innovation, which is in
the public interest.

E-commerce
Discussion on e-commerce was
based on five submissions: Canada’s
submission on its national experience
of an enforcement initiative against the
sale of counterfeit products over the
Internet; a joint paper by Argentina and
Brazil on e-commerce and copyright;
a paper by Argentina, Brazil and
Paraguay on digital solutions for ensuring
authenticity, integrity and privacy of
online transactions within MERCOSUR
(the Southern Common Market); the
European Union’s submission on
regulatory frameworks, policies to ensure
open markets, government initiatives
facilitating the development
of e-commerce and information sharing
on e-commerce policies and their impact
on e-commerce; and Singapore’s paper
on the potential of e-commerce to
help small enterprises expand and the
challenge of digital connectivity in many
developing countries.

Some delegations argued that the
evidence does not support the
assumption that strong intellectual
property rights (IPRs) foster innovation.
IPRs are only one among many factors
contributing to innovation and innovation
needs to be driven by what is in the
public interest.

Background on trade
and environment
Sustainable development and
protection and preservation of
the environment are fundamental
goals of the WTO. The Committee
on Trade and Environment is
responsible for examining the
relationship between trade and
the environment.

Sustainable
Development Goal
14 aims to conserve
and sustainably use
the oceans, seas and
marine resources.

Sustainable fisheries
In 2017, the Committee on Trade and
Environment was briefed on global
and national efforts to address illegal,
unreported and unregulated (IUU)
fishing, to which some US$ 10-23 billion
is estimated to be lost annually. The
UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization
(FAO) outlined its legal instruments and
tools to combat IUU fishing, including
the global record of fishing and other
vessels, voluntary guidelines for catch
documentation schemes, and the Port
State Measures Agreement, which
entered into force in 2016.
The United Nations Conference on Trade
and Development (UNCTAD) briefed
WTO members on its 2016 Trade and
Environment Review publication on fish
trade, which describes the main trends
and the likely impact of climate change
on fish. The Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development provided
an overview of its Fisheries Support
Estimate database, currently covering
31 countries.
Fiji presented the outcome of the
UN Ocean Conference held in June
2017 to support the implementation
of UN Sustainable Development Goal
(SDG) 14, which aims to conserve and
sustainably use the oceans, seas and
marine resources. The call for action
adopted at the conference includes

	

104

supporting sustainable ocean-based
economies and accelerating WTO
negotiations to tackle fisheries subsidies.
The WTO Secretariat reported on the
fisheries subsidies negotiations in
the WTO Negotiating Group on Rules.
The 11th Ministerial Conference (MC11)
in Buenos Aires in December called for
agreement by the next conference in
2019 on comprehensive and effective
disciplines on fisheries subsidies
(see page 57).
Canada updated members on the
plurilateral negotiations on fisheries
subsidies launched in September 2016.
These negotiations are open to all WTO
members and are complementary to the
ongoing multilateral negotiations.

Climate change and trade
The United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate Change
(UNFCC) briefed the Committee on
climate change discussions, notably
meetings of parties of the Paris
Agreement, which entered into force in
November 2016, setting out a global
action plan to limit global warming.
Korea, New Zealand and Peru updated
WTO members on their respective
pledges under the agreement.
China outlined its renewable energy
policy and projects. It said it had
obtained almost 13 per cent of its

New Zealand considered the WTO
to be uniquely placed to address the
relationship between the reform of fossil
fuel subsidies and trade. Jointly with
Finland, it organized a high-level event
at MC11 on “Fossil Fuel Subsidies
Reform and Trade: Understanding the
Linkages”. However, not all members
see the WTO as the appropriate forum
to discuss the issue.

energy from renewables in 2015, up
from 6 per cent in 2005. New Zealand
shared information on the Global
Research Alliance on Agricultural GHGs,
a partnership launched among 49
countries to increase food production
without generating more greenhouse
gases (GHGs).

A workshop was
held at the WTO
in June 2017 to improve
understanding of
the relationship
between trade and
climate change.

A workshop, co-sponsored by Korea,
Canada, Costa Rica, Mexico, Norway,
Switzerland and Chinese Taipei, was
held at the WTO in June 2017 to improve
understanding of the relationship
between trade and climate change.
Director-General Roberto Azevêdo noted
that “for the WTO to play its full part,
members must continue to deepen their
dialogue, identify where the challenges
lie, what current practices are, and of
course – what the WTO can bring to the
table”. Several delegations expressed
support for discussions in the WTO but
others suggested that climate change is
better left to other fora.

Reform of fossil
fuel subsidies
On behalf of the Friends of Fossil Fuel
Subsidy Reform (FFSR) – an informal
group of non-G20 countries – New
Zealand told the Committee that the
FFSR Communiqué of 2015 continues
to attract signatories. It calls for
increased efforts to eliminate inefficient
fossil fuel subsidies.

The Secretariat of the Basel, Rotterdam
and Stockholm (BRS) conventions,
which aim to protect human health and
the environment from the harmful effects
of chemicals and hazardous waste,
briefed delegations on their “Conference
of Parties” (CoP) meetings held in 2017.
On the margins of the CoP meetings,
the WTO and BRS secretariats
organized an event which noted that
trade has an important role to play in
supporting global efforts to strengthen
the management of hazardous chemicals
and waste. The Committee was also
briefed on the Minamata Convention on
Mercury, which aims to protect against
the harmful effects of mercury.
The United Nations Industrial
Development Organization briefed the
Committee on assisting countries in
complying with obligations regarding
polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs)
under the Stockholm Convention
and in implementing the Minamata
Convention. PCB, a man-made chemical
the manufacture of which is banned,
was widely used in the mining industry
and its residual presence can be an
environmental danger. Peru presented
its experience with environmentally
sound management of PCBs in the
mining sector.

MEAs and other
international organizations
In 2017, the WTO Secretariat introduced
updates to the multilateral environmental
agreements (MEA) matrix to include
sections on the Port State Measures
Agreement, the Paris Agreement and
the Kigali amendment to the Montreal
Protocol for the phase-down of the
production and consumption of
hydrofluorocarbons.

UN Environment
Executive Director
Erik Solheim and DG
Azevêdo launched a
new dialogue on using
trade to strengthen
both the economy
and the environment.

A high-level event is planned for Geneva
in 2018 to bring together leaders from
the public and private sectors to kickstart the work. The collaboration was
announced at the World Economic
Forum in Davos in January 2018.
“While trade has brought prosperity to
many, we must ensure that it also works
for our natural resources, for our climate
and for all people,” UN Environment
Executive Director Solheim said.
Director-General Azevêdo said that the
initiative was rooted in the very same
notion that “inspired the creation of the

	

106

WTO more than 20 years ago: that trade
can serve as a powerful tool to improve
human well-being in all its dimensions –
economic, social and environmental”.

WTO environmental
database
The WTO Secretariat presented
the 2014 and 2015 updates to the
environmental database. The database
covers all environment-related
notifications submitted by WTO
members (see Figure 12) as well as
environmental measures and policies
mentioned in trade policy reviews.
Members called for improvements to the
database interface and search functions.

Technical assistance
and outreach
In 2017, the WTO held workshops
on trade and the environment in
Madagascar, Montenegro and Argentina.
A joint WTO-United Nations Economic
and Social Commission for Asia
(UNESCAP) workshop for the AsiaPacific was organized in Sri Lanka.
Trade and environment training was also
delivered as part of the WTO’s Genevabased and regional trade policy courses
and through the e-learning platform.
Outreach activities included a session
on trade and the SDGs during the WTO
Public Forum (see page 166) and an
event to mark World Environment Day
2017, which explored the role of trade
in helping reduce, reuse and recycle
waste. At the Global Review of Aid for
Trade, the WTO and the European Bank
for Reconstruction and Development
organized a side event on small and
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and
green value chains.
The WTO participated at the UN
Ocean Conference and in activities
organized by FAO and UNCTAD, among
others, on sustainable fisheries and the
implementation of SDG 14. The WTO
also participated at the UN Environment
Assembly and collaborated in side
events held at the conference of parties
meeting of the UNFCCC.

•	 T
 he Working Group continued to analyse the relationship
between technology transfer and trade.
•	 Discussions underscored that economies need to
pursue policies that attract foreign direct investment.
•	 WTO members underlined the importance of
experience-sharing by economies that have
made rapid technological advances.

Background on trade and
transfer of technology
The Working Group on Trade
and Transfer of Technology was
established at the Doha Ministerial
Conference in 2001 “to examine
the relationship between trade and
transfer of technology and to make
recommendations on steps that
might be taken, within the mandate
of the WTO, to increase flows of
technology to developing countries”.

WTO members continued their
discussion on the relationship between
trade and transfer of technology,
but with a low level of engagement.
Members recognized that technology
and technical know-how play an
important role in improving productivity,
promoting export growth and supporting
economic growth in developing and
least-developed countries.
The discussions underscored the
importance of effective transfer of skills
and intangible know-how, successful
learning and the effective application
of such knowledge in the technology

transfer process and in enhancing
production capability, securing
economies of scale and achieving
improvements in product quality.
Economies, in their efforts to harness
development, need to pursue policies
that attract foreign direct investment
and technology.
Members felt that rapid technological
advances and an increasingly
information-driven global economy are
impacting on the competitiveness and
market opportunities of specific groups
and regions – a problem which a number
of countries are struggling to address.
Pakistan told the July meeting of the
Working Party that the fundamental goal
of technology transfer is to help build
technological capacities in countries
which are at the lower rung of innovation
and technical know-how. Transfer of
technology is a long-term dynamic
process and not a one-off transaction.
It requires constant adaptation by all
actors in the process, Pakistan said.
There was broad recognition that the
path to innovation and technology could
lead to development and industrialization
creating wealth, jobs and improving
standards of living. In this regard,
the need for focused and meaningful
work in the Working Group that could
help address these challenges was
repeatedly underscored. Members
also laid emphasis on the importance
of sharing experiences and concrete
examples of how members which had
made rapid advances on the technology
frontier had overcome similar difficulties.

I nc rea s i ng
women’s role
i n t rade
At the 11th Ministerial Conference in December 2017, WTO
members joined for the first time a collective initiative to
increase the participation of women in trade. By supporting
the Buenos Aires Declaration on Trade and Women’s
Economic Empowerment, 120 WTO members and observers
have demonstrated their commitment to helping women
reach their full potential in the world economy and to
removing barriers to women’s advancement.

Supporters of the declaration have
committed themselves, among other
things, to sharing experiences and
best practices on inclusive policies
and data collection. They have also
committed to working together in the
WTO to ensure that Aid for Trade
(see page 151) supports the
development and implementation of
more gender-responsive trade policies.
Director-General Roberto Azevêdo
stated that the declaration “provides
guidance from the members to the
WTO for the way forward and the
WTO will play its full part. It will be
a vital element in the WTO’s work to
make trade more inclusive.”
Three-quarters of men are in the labour
force compared with only 50 per cent

of women. Close to 40 per cent of
small and medium-sized enterprises
(SMEs) worldwide are women-owned
businesses but only 15 per cent of
exporting firms are led by women.
Globally, it is estimated that the
elimination of all forms of discrimination
against women would raise per capita
productivity by 40 per cent.
Gender issues are being raised with
increasing frequency at the WTO. For
example, a group of members, led by
Canada, proposed including gender
equality in negotiations on domestic
regulations in services. Other members,
notably the European Union and Iceland,
have used their trade policy reviews
(see page 114) to highlight policy
developments that contribute to gender
equality. The gender perspective was
also discussed at the WTO’s Public
Forum (see page 166).
At the WTO’s Aid for Trade Global
Review in July 2017 (see page 154),
speakers at a high-level session on
gender and trade said that removing
barriers to women fully participating
in trade is critical not only for the
empowerment of women but also for
economic growth and development in
general. A number of other sessions at
the Review were dedicated to gender
issues, with donors and other partners
discussing how to increase their focus
on women’s empowerment and how Aid

for Trade impacts on women. Gender
was also a cross-cutting issue in the Aid
for Trade Work Programme for 2016-17.

The Buenos
Aires Declaration
on Trade and
Women’s Economic
Empowerment will be
a vital element in the
WTO’s work to make
trade more inclusive.
DG Azevêdo

The WTO marked International Women’s
Day on 8 March 2017 with a programme
of events and discussions looking at
women’s economic empowerment and
how more can be done to promote
gender equality within the organization.
The Director-General launched a report,
“Women and the WTO”, showing that
the participation of women in the WTO
Secretariat has increased steadily over
the years while also highlighting areas
where more progress can be made,
including in chairing WTO bodies. In
June 2017, for the first time, the WTO
nominated a gender focal point to
coordinate work among divisions.
The WTO’s technical assistance plan
for 2018-19, adopted in November 2017,
gives the WTO Secretariat a mandate
to develop a training module to “raise
awareness and enhance the aptitude
of policy makers to incorporate gender
considerations in their analysis and trade
policy development or negotiations”.
In addition, the WTO has launched a
partnership with the World Bank to

Spotlight: Increasing women’s role in trade
www.wto.org/womenandtrade
	

generate new data and promote better
understanding of the impact of trade
on women. It has also launched a
research project with the Organisation
for Economic Co-operation and
Development looking at how Aid for
Trade can help women’s empowerment.
In October, the WTO launched an Action
Plan on Trade and Gender, with four
objectives: raising awareness on the link
between trade and gender; facilitating
WTO members’ actions on trade and
gender; generating new data on the
impact of trade on women; and providing
training to government officials and to
women entrepreneurs.
The WTO also released a brochure,
“Gender-Aware Trade Policy:
A Springboard for Women’s Economic
Empowerment”, on how trade can be
a driving force for women’s economic
empowerment. It highlights that women
play a vital role in the economy and if
given equal opportunities, they could
contribute to economic growth and
social inclusion at all levels. The brochure
underlines that trade can play a key role
in delivering opportunities for women
and can be a driving force for their
economic empowerment.

Reg ional t rade
ag re ement s
•	 I n 2017, the WTO received 25 notifications of regional
trade agreements (RTAs) currently in force, up from
22 in 2016.
•	 The notifications involved 15 new RTAs. The Americas
notified the highest number – seven.
•	 The Committee continued to examine the impact of RTAs
on the multilateral trading system.
•	 The RTA database was further improved, adding
information and facilitating searches and comparisons.

Background on regional
trade agreements
The Committee on Regional Trade
Agreements (CRTA) monitors all
regional trade agreements (RTAs)
notified to the WTO, except those
notified under special provisions
for agreements between
developing countries (the Enabling
Clause), which are considered
by the Committee on Trade and
Development. The CRTA examines
RTAs individually and considers
their systemic implications for the
multilateral trading system.

284

A total of 284 of the
RTAs notified to the
WTO were in force at
the end of 2017.

Notifications
WTO members submitted 25
notifications concerning regional trade
agreements (RTAs) in 2017. These
notifications (submitted separately for
trade in goods, services and accessions
to existing RTAs) correspond to 15
new RTAs.
Of the 15 RTAs, six included goods and
services provisions while nine included
goods provisions only. In addition, one of
these concerns an RTA that is not yet in
force. As in 2016, only three of the RTAs
were between developed and developing
partners, while eight were between
developing partners only and four RTAs
were between developed partners only.
Members from the Americas were
involved in the highest number of
RTAs – seven – followed by the Asia
Pacific region and Europe – five each.
Other RTAs involved members from the
Commonwealth of Independent States
(four) and Africa (three). Nine of the
agreements covered members from
two different regions and six covered
members from one region.
The notifications took the number
of RTAs notified to the WTO by
31 December 2017 to 669, of which
455 were in force (see Figure 13).
RTAs include free trade agreements and
customs unions. Under WTO rules, the
goods and services aspects of RTAs,
as well as accessions to existing RTAs,

	

110

World Trade Organization  Annual Report 2018

must be notified separately and thus
are counted separately. However, if all
three elements are counted together, the
669 notifications involved 479 individual
RTAs, of which 284 were in force.
Some 69 RTAs had not been notified to
the WTO as of 27 October 2017. Since
2011, the WTO Secretariat has been
issuing a list of RTAs in force but not
notified. In 2017, nine RTAs included in
the list of non-notified RTAs were notified
to the WTO.

Monitoring RTAs
All RTAs, regardless of whether they
are notified under Article XXIV of the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
(GATT) 1994, the Enabling Clause
between developing countries (for trade
in goods), or Article V of the General
Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS
– for trade in services), are subject to
the provisions and procedures of the
transparency mechanism.
The mechanism provides specific
guidelines on when a new RTA should
be notified to the WTO Secretariat and
the related information and data to be
provided. It also requires the Secretariat
to prepare a factual presentation on each
RTA, and that each RTA be reviewed
by WTO members. By the end of 2017,
159 RTAs involving 107 WTO members
had been reviewed, up from 143
agreements involving 106 members
at the end of 2016.

Agreements notified under Article XXIV
of the GATT 1994 and Article V of the
GATS are considered by the Committee
on Regional Trade Agreements (CRTA)
while agreements notified under the
Enabling Clause (see page 110) are
considered by a dedicated session of the
Committee on Trade and Development
(CTD), using the Secretariat’s
factual presentation as the basis for
consideration (see Table 2).
Under the transparency mechanism,
WTO members are encouraged to
inform the Secretariat of any agreements
currently being negotiated or those that
have been signed but are yet to enter into
force (so-called early announcements).
They are required to inform the
Secretariat of any changes to a notified
agreement and to provide a report once
an agreement is fully implemented.

2. Considered in the Committee on Trade and Development:
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) – India (goods)
Note: The table refers to 11 agreements, six of which covered both goods and services, four covered only
goods and one only services.

In 2017, the CRTA considered 16
notifications of RTAs, counting goods,
services and accessions separately,
compared with 29 in 2016 and 19 in
2015. The CTD held one dedicated
session on RTAs and considered one
RTA notified under the Enabling Clause.
The transparency mechanism also
requires the Secretariat to prepare
“factual abstracts” on RTAs examined by
the CRTA prior to their entry into force.
By the end of 2017, 72 factual abstracts
of agreements currently in force had
been prepared in consultation with the
relevant RTA parties and posted in the
RTA database.
In addition, three “early announcements”
of RTAs were received from WTO
members in 2017, one for a newly signed
RTA not yet in force and two for RTAs
under negotiation. As of December
2017, the WTO had received 106 early
announcements. Sixty-seven of these
had subsequently been notified to
the WTO following entry into force
of the agreements.

	

112

World Trade Organization  Annual Report 2018

The CRTA also discusses end-ofimplementation reports for RTAs. Most
RTAs are implemented over a transition
period and the transparency mechanism
requires RTA parties to submit a short
written report on how the liberalization
commitments are put into effect.
Two such reports were submitted in
2017. The reports are important for
understanding whether RTAs accomplish
what they set out to do. The Chair of the
CRTA, Walid Doudech (Tunisia), noted
that implementation reports had been
due for 136 RTAs as of 13 February
2017 but only two were received
during the year.
The General Council established the
transparency mechanism on a provisional
basis in 2006. Members are required
to review the legal relationship between
the mechanism and relevant WTO
provisions on RTAs. The Negotiating
Group on Rules started the review
in 2011. In Nairobi in December
2015, ministers called on WTO
members to work towards making
the mechanism permanent.

Regional trade agreements

-----------------------Page 114 End-----------------------

Impact of RTAs on the
multilateral trading system
With RTAs becoming increasingly
comprehensive, the Nairobi Ministerial
Declaration of December 2015
reaffirmed the need to ensure they
remain complementary to, and not a
substitute for, the multilateral trading
system. It instructed the CRTA to
discuss the systemic implications of
RTAs for the multilateral trading system
and their relationship with WTO rules.

The Committee
discussed the
relationship between
trade facilitation
provisions in RTAs
and the WTO’s
Trade Facilitation
Agreement.

In April, the Committee discussed the
relationship between trade facilitation
provisions in RTAs and the WTO’s Trade
Facilitation Agreement (see page 94).
The discussion looked at how certain
RTAs converge with or diverge from the
provisions of the TFA. Members also
heard how trade facilitation provisions
in RTAs have evolved and shaped TFA
negotiations and how, in turn, the TFA
could set the basis for customs and
trade facilitation chapters in future RTAs.

RTA database
The WTO’s RTA database (http://rtais.
wto.org), where details of RTAs notified
to the WTO are stored, was further
strengthened in 2017 with the addition
of new features and more information.
The new additions became available to
the public on 14 December 2017. The
principal changes involve:
•	an expanded list of topics and
provisions which can be searched
across all notified RTAs currently in
force (previously only a subset of RTAs
was covered)

An expanded list of topics
covered in RTAs
The number of topics covered has been
expanded to 41 and the topics further
sub-divided into 72 provisions.
This permits users to search the
database for RTAs that contain one
or several of these topics or provisions.
Interactive graphs
A series of interactive graphs allows the
user to produce graphs showing the
evolution of RTAs by country or region,
or by date of entry into force, signature or
notification. The underlying data used to
produce the graphs can be exported to
an Excel spreadsheet.
Preferential tariff search
The third new feature allows the user
to search the preferential tariff offered
by individual members of the WTO
under their RTAs, compared to their
latest most-favoured-nation tariff. The
search function is provided at the tariff
line level. Thus, an exporter in a given
country could analyse preferential tariffs
in distinct export markets for certain
products and compare them to the
MFN tariff.
The information generated by the
database now permits users not only to
identify RTAs with the provisions they
are interested in, it also provides a
clearer picture of any common features
of RTAs and the evolution of emerging
trends in RTAs.

•	interactive graphs on the evolution of
RTA notifications to the GATT and

•	 In 2017, the Trade Policy Review Body reviewed
23 WTO members.
•	 The eight West African Economic and Monetary Union
members were reviewed together for the first time.
•	 Bolivia and Sierra Leone were reviewed after
a 12-year gap.
•	 Six follow-up workshops and a regional roundtable
trade policy workshop were held during the year.

Background on
Trade Policy Reviews
The Trade Policy Review
Mechanism aims at encouraging
all WTO members to adhere to
WTO rules. Through its regular
Trade Policy Reviews, the
mechanism enables members
to collectively examine the trade
policies and practices of individual
members in all trade-related areas.
The four largest trading entities
(currently the European Union,
the United States, China and
Japan) are reviewed every two
years (three starting in 2019), the
next 16 largest every four years
(five starting in 2019), and other
members every six years (seven
starting in 2019). Reviews are not
intended to serve as a basis for the
enforcement of obligations or for
dispute settlement procedures.

In 2017, the Trade Policy Review Body
(TPRB) reviewed the trade policies and
practices of 23 WTO members, the
same number as in 2016. By the end
of 2017, the TPRB had conducted 467
reviews since 1989, covering 153 of the
164 WTO members.
The eight West African Economic and
Monetary Union member countries
– Benin, Burkina Faso, Côte d’Ivoire,
Guinea Bissau, Mali, Niger, Senegal
and Togo – were reviewed together for
the first time. The Plurinational State of
Bolivia and Sierra Leone were reviewed
for the first time since 2005. The other
members reviewed were Japan, Mexico,
Belize, Mozambique, Switzerland,
Liechtenstein, Nigeria, the European
Union, Brazil, Jamaica, Paraguay, Iceland
and Cambodia. The dates of the trade
policy reviews and the members covered
are shown in the map on pages 116-117.
The European Union, Japan and the
United States are the most reviewed
members, having been reviewed 13
times each. They are followed by:
Canada – 10 times; Australia, Brazil,
Hong Kong (China), the Republic of
Korea, Singapore, Switzerland and
Thailand – seven times; China, India,
Indonesia, Malaysia, Mexico, Norway
and Turkey – six times; and Chile,

	

114

World Trade Organization  Annual Report 2018

Iceland, Liechtenstein, Morocco,
New Zealand, Nigeria and South Africa
– five times. Thirty-one members have
been reviewed four times and 30
members three times.
Five members opted for the alternative
timeline for the submission of written
questions and replies for their TPR
meetings in 2017. The alternative timeline
was introduced at the fourth appraisal
of the Trade Policy Review Mechanism
(TPRM) in 2011. It requires members
to submit questions four weeks before
a meeting and requires the reviewed
member to submit written responses
one week in advance.
Digital audio files (podcasting)
were discontinued as of 2017 in
line with the sixth TPRM appraisal
in 2016. The seven-minute rule for
members’ interventions continued
to work satisfactorily.
Printed versions of each trade
policy review are available as WTO
publications. These include the report
by the WTO Secretariat, the report by
the member under review, the concluding
remarks by the Chair of the TPRB and
a key trade policy facts section.

Trade Policy Reviews

-----------------------Page 116 End-----------------------

TPR follow-up workshops
After a trade policy review, the reviewed
member can ask the Secretariat to
organize a follow-up workshop with
domestic stakeholders to further
disseminate the outcome of the review
and to discuss technical assistance
and capacity-building needs.

467

In 2017, six follow-up workshops –
for Chad, Congo, Guatemala,
Honduras, the Solomon Islands
and the United Arab Emirates – were
conducted. In addition, a regional trade
policy roundtable workshop for five
Asian least-developed countries (LDCs)
was organized in Myanmar to facilitate
dialogue among the participants about
TPR best practices and how the TPR
process can help these countries
undertake trade-related reforms and
mainstream trade into their wider
economic and development policies.

By the end of 2017, the
WTO had conducted
467 Trade Policy
Reviews since 1989.

Trade Policy Review
programme for 2018
Eighteen TPR meetings are scheduled
to be held in 2018 for 23 members.
They are: The Gambia; Malaysia; Egypt;
the Philippines; Montenegro; Guinea;
Mauritania; Colombia; Norway; Uruguay;
China; Israel; Chinese Taipei; Armenia;
Vanuatu; Hong Kong, China; East
African Community (Burundi, Kenya,

•	 WTO members introduced fewer trade-restricting
measures in year to October 2017.
•	 Members implemented more trade-facilitating than
trade-restricting measures.
•	 World merchandise trade volume grew by 4.7 per cent
in 2017 after just 1.8 per cent in 2016.
•	 Despite the improved trade outlook, substantial risks

Background on trade
monitoring reports
The WTO began regular
monitoring of global trade
developments in early 2009,
covering all trade-related
measures implemented by WTO
members and observers. Initially
launched in the context of the
global financial and economic
crisis, the trade monitoring
exercise has become a regular
function in the WTO that further
strengthens the transparency
aims of the Trade Policy Review
Mechanism by shedding light
on the latest trends in the
implementation of a broad range
of policy measures that facilitate
as well as restrict the flow of trade.
The trade monitoring is overseen
by the Trade Policy Review Body.

I urge members
to redouble efforts
to refrain from
implementing new
trade restrictive
measures and to
reverse existing
measures.

The trade monitoring reports showed
that WTO members introduced fewer
trade-restrictive measures from midOctober 2016 to mid-October 2017
compared with the previous year. It was
the second successive year-on-year
decline. WTO members continued to
implement more trade-facilitating than
trade-restrictive measures.
The WTO Secretariat prepared
four reports on global trade policy
developments during 2017. The reports
pointed out the need for WTO members
to show leadership in reiterating their
commitment to open and mutually
beneficial trade as a key driver of
economic growth and a major engine
for prosperity.
The trade monitoring reports are
intended to be purely factual and have no
legal effect on the rights and obligations
of WTO members. The reports neither
seek to pronounce themselves on
whether a trade measure is protectionist
nor do they question the explicit right of
members to take certain trade measures.
Almost all restrictive trade measures
appear to have been taken within the
flexibilities provided for in the multilateral
trading system. The overwhelming
majority of tariff increases are taken
within bound ceilings and do not appear
to break WTO rules.

Regarding trade remedy actions,
these measures are often taken to
address what is perceived by some as
a market distortion resulting from the
practices of another trading partner.
The WTO’s Anti-dumping Agreement
and Subsidies and Countervailing
Measures Agreement permit WTO
members to impose anti-dumping or
countervailing duties to offset what is
perceived to be injurious dumping or
subsidization of products exported from
one member to another. The reports are
not in a position to establish if, where or
when such perceived distortive practices
have taken place.
More notifications of sanitary and
phytosanitary (SPS) measures and
technical barriers to trade (TBT)
measures do not automatically
imply greater use of protectionist or
unnecessarily trade-restrictive measures
but rather enhanced transparency
regarding these measures. The reports
emphasize that the SPS Agreement
and the TBT Agreement specifically
allow members to take measures in
the pursuit of a number of legitimate
policy objectives.
The WTO Secretariat strives to ensure
that the trade monitoring reports are
factual and objective accounts of
recent trends in trade policy making.
The reports seek to provide a nuanced
perspective on trade developments.

Continuous consultation

WTO members applied 108 new traderestrictive measures during the 12-month
period under review. This equated to
an average of nine measures per month
compared with 15 in the previous period
(see Figure 14).

The most important element in collecting
trade policy information for the reports
is the close and continuous consultation
between the WTO Secretariat and
WTO members, which seeks to gather
complete, up-to-date and accurate
information on trade-related measures
and to verify the relevant information
collected from other public sources.

WTO members also implemented 128
measures aimed at facilitating trade.
At almost 11 measures per month, this
was significantly lower than the monthly
average of 18 recorded in the previous
annual overview (see Figure 15).

The estimated trade coverage of importfacilitating measures (US$ 169 billion)
was more than twice the trade coverage
of import-restrictive measures
(US$ 79 billion – see Figure 16).
Moreover, the trade coverage of
liberalization associated with measures
implemented in the context of the
expanded WTO Information Technology
Agreement (see page 91) amounted
to around US$ 385 billion, according to
WTO Secretariat estimates.
International trade flows rebounded
strongly after a sharp slowdown in 2016.
World merchandise trade grew by 4.7
per cent in volume in 2017, well above
the 1.8 per cent increase for 2016.
“This improved outlook is very welcome,
but substantial risks that threaten
the world economy remain in place
and could easily undermine any trade
recovery,” Director-General Roberto
Azevêdo said. “Further progress will
require continued commitment. I urge
members to redouble efforts to refrain
from implementing new trade-restrictive
measures, and to reverse existing
measures,” he added.
On trade remedy measures (antidumping, countervailing and safeguard
measures), the review period saw a
slight deceleration both in initiations
of investigations and in terminations of
measures, compared with the previous
annual overview. Anti-dumping measures
continue to make up the bulk of all trade
remedy initiations, accounting for 83 per
cent of initiations.

In preparation for each report, the
Director-General writes to all WTO
members and observers inviting them
to provide the WTO Secretariat with
information on recent trade-related
measures as well as general economic
support measures.
The WTO Secretariat collates all
recorded country-specific information
on trade measures and re-submits this
information to each WTO member for
verification. This verification process is a
unique feature of the WTO’s monitoring
efforts and represents a quality-control
mechanism, allowing members to check
the accuracy of the information before
it is made public. The trade monitoring
reports are subsequently discussed at
meetings of the WTO’s Trade Policy
Review Body.
The reports covered several other
important trade-related developments
during 2016-17. These included new
initiatives in regional trade agreements,
developments in the areas of the
Trade Facilitation Agreement and the
Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual
Property Rights Agreement and
developments in government
procurement, electronic commerce
and the Aid for Trade programme.

Database
The Trade Monitoring Database, which
is publicly available, provides information
on trade measures implemented by
WTO members and observers and
includes various search criteria options,
e.g. country or country group, HS code,
type of measure, date of measure.
Members are regularly invited to update
information compiled by the WTO
Secretariat since 2008 so as to facilitate
an evaluation of the extent of “rollback”
of such measures.

T rade, debt
and f i nanc e
•	 D
 G Azevêdo – with the support of the Working Group on
Trade, Debt and Finance – continued efforts to facilitate
access of developing countries to trade finance.
•	 The Asian Development Bank reported a US$ 1.5 trillion
“gap” between supply and demand for trade finance.
•	 Possible solutions involve more co-financing and co-risk
sharing between multilateral development banks and a
return of the private sector to credit markets.
•	 WTO, World Bank, IMF report says strong global trading
system, with WTO at its “core”, remains critical.

Background on trade,
debt and finance
WTO ministers decided in Doha in
2001 to establish a Working Group
on Trade, Debt and Finance to look
at how the WTO could contribute
to finding a durable solution to the
external debt problems of many
developing countries and to avoid
having WTO members’ trade
opportunities undercut by financial
instabilities. The Working Group
has been focusing its attention
on a range of financial issues with
an impact on trade, including the
provision of trade finance and, more
recently, the relationship between
exchange rates and trade.

8 0 -90 %
Some 80-90 per cent of
world trade relies
on trade finance.

Director-General Azevêdo continued
to address the challenges facing
developing countries, and particularly
their small and medium-sized enterprises
(SMEs), in accessing trade finance.
He has advocated a number of
measures to address the financing
gap, including enhancing trade finance
facilitation programmes, helping
local banking sectors to grow by
better training, improved monitoring
of problems and maintaining a close
dialogue with regulators.
At its July and November 2017 meetings,
the WTO Working Group on Trade,
Debt and Finance reiterated its support
for the Director-General’s reaching out
to heads of other relevant institutions.
Some 80-90 per cent of world trade
relies on trade finance. But since the
global financial crisis, the financial
system has been highly selective in
lending and in extending guarantees
to developing countries, particularly to
SMEs. An Asian Development Bank
survey estimated the trade finance
gap between supply and demand at
US$ 1.5 trillion for 2016. According to
banks, 74 per cent of rejected requests
came from micro and small and medium-

	

120

World Trade Organization  Annual Report 2018

sized enterprises (MSMEs) and mid-cap
firms (capitalized at less than US$ 10
billion). Only 40 per cent of firms were
able to complete trade transactions
without bank-intermediated trade finance.
The Director-General held an informal
roundtable on trade finance with senior
officials from multilateral development
banks (MDBs) at the Aid for Trade
Global Review (see page 154). The
message from the banks, which are
supporting an average of US$ 20 billion
to US$ 25 billion of trade per annum,
was that scope for action is limited.
Possible solutions included co-financing
and co-risk sharing between MDBs,
bringing the private sector back into
the most challenging markets and
encouraging co-financing between
MDBs and commercial banks. All MDBs
agreed to boost capacity building for
trade finance. They also asked for a
regulatory dialogue with the Financial
Stability Board, an international body
monitoring the financial system.
The Director-General has been working
closely with the CEO of the International
Finance Corporation (IFC), Philippe
Le Houérou, to enhance dialogue with
financial regulators on trade finance.

Expert Group on
Trade Finance

DG Azevêdo
continued to
place a focus on
addressing the
challenges facing
small businesses
in accessing trade
finance.

Under the chairmanship of the DirectorGeneral, the Expert Group on Trade
Finance continued to evaluate gaps
in trade finance markets. One approach
is for MDBs to expand their trade
finance facilitation programmes.
The Expert Group includes the IFC,
regional development banks, export
credit agencies, big commercial banks
and other international organizations.

Strengthening cooperation
Under the so-called coherence mandate,
the WTO, the World Bank and the
International Monetary Fund (IMF)
address issues of trade finance and
development. One topic addressed
in 2017 was the relationship between
trade, technology, jobs and globalization.
A joint publication – “Making trade an
engine of growth for all” – notes that
while trade opening has generated
higher living standards, some parts
of the world have suffered from
import competition.

On jobs, the report says that while trade
leads to productivity gains and significant
benefits for consumers, especially the
poor, it can also be responsible for job
displacement that must be addressed
through sound domestic policies to
help the unemployed get back on their
feet. The report also argues that a
strong global trading system, with
the WTO at its core, remains critical.
The WTO has a unique role to play
in fostering stable, predictable and
equitable trading relations across
the world, the report says.
DG Azevêdo, IMF Managing Director
Christine Lagarde and World Bank
Group President Jim Yong Kim met
regularly at IMF and World Bank
gatherings and at the G20 in 2017.

•	 Australia’s accession to the Government Procurement
Agreement (GPA) moved towards a possible conclusion.
•	 Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan negotiations advanced;
Russia presented market access offer.
•	 The Committee received application for accession
from the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.
•	 Significant work completed on GPA work programmes.

Background on
the Government
Procurement Agreement
The GPA aims to open up, based
on principles of reciprocity, and
to the extent agreed between
WTO members, government
procurement markets to foreign
competition and to make
government procurement more
transparent. It provides legal
guarantees of non-discrimination
for the products, services or
suppliers of GPA parties in
procurement covered by the
Agreement. The GPA is a
plurilateral agreement —open to
all interested WTO members and
binding only the parties to the
agreement. Currently, 47 WTO
members (including the EU and
its 28 member states) are bound
by the Agreement. The Committee
on Government Procurement
administers the GPA.

Accessions to the GPA
Work to complete Australia’s accession
to the WTO’s Government Procurement
Agreement (GPA) intensified in 2017
with the circulation of its second revised
market access offer. The accessions of
the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan to the
47-member Agreement also continued
to advance.
Russia made its initial market access
offer, kicking off its accession
negotiations. The Committee on
Government Procurement also
received a formal application for
accession from the former Yugoslav
Republic of Macedonia.
Constructive discussions continued
on China’s accession, possibly paving
the way for the country to submit a
revised market access offer in 2018. The
GPA parties see Russia’s and China’s
accessions, on the appropriate terms,
as very significant for the Agreement,
for the WTO and for the world economy.
The GPA is a plurilateral agreement
within the WTO framework, meaning
only the parties to the Agreement are
bound by its terms. Any WTO members
can apply. Accession negotiations
include a review of the candidate’s
legislative and policy frameworks, to
ensure full compliance with the GPA,
and negotiations on market access
commitments. Government procurement

	

122

World Trade Organization  Annual Report 2018

accounts for about 15 per cent of
developed and developing-country
economies. Only a part of this is
currently covered by the GPA.
The Chair of the Committee,
Ambassador John Newham (Ireland),
updated the Committee on his outreach
efforts to Latin American countries
regarding their potential interest in the
Agreement. Brazil and Afghanistan were
granted observer status under the GPA,
bringing the number of observers to 31.
The Committee also reviewed the status
of other pending GPA accessions and
accession commitments. In June 2017,
Georgia updated the Committee on
its ongoing government procurement
reforms and indicated it was conducting
a feasibility and impact study on
GPA accession.
The past decade has witnessed
steady growth in GPA membership
(see Figure 17).

Monitoring of implementation
and legislation
The revised Agreement is in force for
all but one of the parties, Switzerland.
The latter has assured the Committee
that it will provide its acceptance as
soon as possible, taking account of
relevant internal requirements and
legislative procedures.

Ten countries are
in the process of
acceding to the
Government
Procurement
Agreement.

The revised GPA entered into force
on 6 April 2014. It extended GPA
coverage to approximately 500 additional
procurement entities, including local
government and sub-central entities,
together with new services and other
areas of public procurement activities.
The GPA’s role was strengthened
in promoting good governance,
battling corruption and protecting
the environment.
Continuing progress was made on the
WTO’s e-GPA web portal (https://e-gpa.
wto.org/). The portal provides a single
entry point for market access information
under the revised Agreement together
with related information that parties have
committed to provide. It offers improved
transparency, with the aim of better
publicizing market access opportunities.
Envisaged further improvements include
a module to handle notifications and to
facilitate access to related data.
At the Committee’s formal meeting in
October, a discussion was held on “buynational” initiatives in the United States.
A number of delegations expressed
concerns regarding an executive order
issued in April 2017, entitled

Government Procurement Agreement
www.wto.org/gpa
	

“Buy American and Hire American”,
and related developments and initiatives.
The United States responded by
providing detailed information
concerning the executive order and
the review process that it mandated.

Work programmes
Significant work was undertaken by
the Committee on its work programmes.
Attention focused on sustainable
procurement, the collection and
reporting of statistical data and small and
medium-sized enterprises. As an input
to the work programme on sustainable
procurement, the WTO Secretariat
organized a symposium that featured
contributions from non-governmental
and other experts.
The work programmes are intended to
promote transparency about parties’
implementation of the Agreement,
to improve its administration and to
assist preparations for possible future
negotiations. The revised GPA calls
for further negotiations to improve the
Agreement and to progressively reduce
and eliminate discriminatory measures.

Technical assistance and
international cooperation
In response to growing interest in the
revised GPA and its relationship with
regional initiatives, the WTO Secretariat
carried out an intensive programme of
technical assistance during the year.
This included two regional workshops,
two national seminars and a number of
Geneva-based and other activities.
The two regional workshops were held
in Argentina for Latin American countries
and in Georgia for Central and Eastern
Europe, Central Asia and the Caucasus.
National seminars were organized for
Sri Lanka and China.

World Trade Organization  Annual Report 2018

In Central and Eastern Europe, the
Secretariat continued its cooperation
with the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development in
providing technical assistance. This
cooperation has greatly facilitated the
accession of countries to the GPA and
reform of their national procurement
systems. Collaboration has also been
strengthened with the Commercial Law
Development Programme of the US
Department of Commerce and other
international organizations, including the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation
and Development, the World Bank and
other regional development banks.

Dispute settlement

D i spute s et t lement
ac t iv it y i n 2017
•	 D
 ispute settlement activity intensified; the monthly
average of panels, appellate and arbitration proceedings
dealt with rose by 20 per cent.
•	 Twenty-four dispute settlement reports, awards and
decisions were circulated in 2017.
•	 N
 ew handbook on the dispute settlement system was
published, explaining the rules and procedures of the
system and exploring how its operation has evolved.

Background on dispute
settlement activity
The General Council convenes
as the Dispute Settlement Body
(DSB) to deal with disputes
between WTO members. Such
disputes may arise with respect
to any agreement contained
in the Final Act of the Uruguay
Round that is subject to the
Understanding on Rules and
Procedures Governing the
Settlement of Disputes. The
DSB has authority to establish
dispute settlement panels, refer
matters to arbitration, adopt panel,
Appellate Body and arbitration
reports, maintain surveillance
over the implementation of
recommendations and rulings
contained in such reports,
and authorize suspension of
concessions in the event of
non-compliance with those
recommendations and rulings.

The number of active
disputes increased
significantly in 2017.

The number of active disputes increased
significantly compared with 2016,
extending the trend of recent years.
Active cases are where a panel or
arbitration has been composed and
where preparations are ongoing for
the finalization of a panel arbitration
or Appellate Body report.
In 2017, the three WTO legal divisions
dealt with 38.5 panel, appellate and
arbitration proceedings on average
each month, compared with 32.3 in
2016. The number was over 33 per
cent more than in 2014 (see Figure 1).
At the end of 2017, there were 25
active panel proceedings, seven
appellate proceedings and three
arbitration proceedings.
Due to the increase in dispute settlement
activity, 29 WTO posts have been
redeployed to the legal divisions over the
past two to three years. By the end of
2017, the Appellate Body had 25 staff,
the Legal Affairs Division 33 and there
were 27 in the Rules Division, up from
17, 23 and 20, respectively, in 2014,
when the reallocations began.
WTO members remained divided at the
end of 2017 on the selection process to
employ to choose three new members
of the Appellate Body (see page 140).

Effective
adjudicatory system
The WTO dispute settlement system is
an effective and successful international
system for dispute settlement. DirectorGeneral Roberto Azevêdo has described
it as “unquestionably one of – if not the –
most active international adjudicatory
systems in the world. And it still operates
faster than any other.”

The WTO dispute
settlement system is
one of the most active
adjudicatory systems
in the world.
DG Azevêdo

Members continue
to be active
WTO members continue to be very
active in dispute settlement (see Tables
1, 2 and 3). The subject matter of
disputes brought to the WTO continues
to span a wide range of agreements,
including the General Agreement

on Tariffs and Trade 1994, the AntiDumping Agreement, the Subsidies and
Countervailing Measures Agreement, the
Safeguards Agreement, the Sanitary and
Phytosanitary Measures Agreement, the
Technical Barriers to Trade Agreement,
the General Agreement on Trade in
Services, the Trade-related Aspects of
Intellectual Property Rights Agreement
and the Agreement on Agriculture.
As in previous years, both developed
and developing country members have
been involved in the dispute settlement
mechanism, both as complainants and
as respondents.

Dispute settlement activity in 2017

-----------------------Page 132 End-----------------------

WTO members
filed 17 new
disputes in 2017.

During 2017, WTO members filed 17
requests for consultations concerning
new disputes (see Table 2) and four
requests for consultations in compliance
proceedings. The Dispute Settlement
Body (DSB) establishes a compliance
panel (Article 21.5 panel) when there
is disagreement over the existence
or consistency of measures taken by
a member to comply with the DSB’s
recommendations and rulings. Table 2
also includes requests for consultations
made in Article 21.5 compliance

proceedings although some members
consider that there is no need to request
consultations prior to requesting
the establishment of an Article 21.5
compliance panel.
The United States, Canada and Qatar
submitted the most requests for
consultations concerning new disputes,
with three each, followed by Russia and
Ukraine with two. The United States also
figured most frequently as respondent,
being cited in four cases, followed by
Canada, which was cited in three.

Translations
The increased workload has also had
significant implications for the WTO’s
translation service, which is experiencing
delays in translating the reports
before they are circulated to the WTO
membership. The continuing influx of
cases foreshadows continuing high levels
of dispute settlement activity in the years
to come as well as continued strain on
available resources, which may result
in delays.

Practices for improving
dispute proceedings
During 2017, Deputy Director-General
Karl Brauner continued to consult with
WTO members in informal consultations
on ways to make efficiencies in the panel
process. Subjects discussed included:
(1) streamlining panel composition by
inviting nominations and appointments
of non-governmental third-party nationals
and suitable candidates who had not
previously served on a panel;
(2) promoting electronic filing in disputes;
(3) improving the expert selection
process and the expert question-andanswer sessions in SPS disputes; and
(4) publishing disputes’ procedural
documents and preliminary rulings.

New handbook on dispute
settlement
The second edition of A Handbook on
the Dispute Settlement System was
published in 2017. The Handbook,

compiled by WTO Secretariat dispute
settlement lawyers, explains the rules
and procedures of the WTO dispute
settlement system and explores how
its operation has evolved since its
entry into force on 1 January 1995. The
book represents a reference tool for
experienced practitioners of WTO law as
well as explaining the dispute settlement
system to any interested person who may
not have a legal background.

Harvard wins
Law students from around the world
gathered in Geneva on 6-10 June for
the final round of the ELSA Moot Court
Competition on WTO Law, a simulated
hearing of the WTO dispute settlement
system, organized by the European Law
Students’ Association (ELSA), with the
support of the WTO.
This 2016-17 edition marked the 15th
anniversary of this competition and also
saw the ever-increasing participation by
universities from developing countries,
with 94 taking part in the competition.
The winning team was from Harvard Law
School, following on from the success
of universities from India, China and
Greece in past years.
To take part in the competition, the teams
prepare and analyse a fictitious case
and present their arguments both for the
complainant and the respondent in front
of a panel that consists of WTO and
trade law experts.

Harvard Law School won the
2017 edition of the dispute
settlement competition.

Challenges

Background on
the Appellate Body
The Appellate Body consists of
seven members appointed by the
Dispute Settlement Body. Each
member is appointed for a term
of four years, with the possibility
of being appointed for one further
four-year term. Three members of
the Appellate Body hear an appeal
of a panel’s ruling. Any party to
a dispute may appeal the panel
report to the Appellate Body.
The appeal is limited to issues
of law covered in the panel
report and legal interpretations
developed by the panel.

The Appellate Body
faces challenges
as it deals with
increasing demand
for its services
and increasingly
complex disputes.

Presenting the Appellate Body’s 2016
Annual Report, Appellate Body Chair
Ujal Singh Bhatia alerted members in
June 2017 that the Appellate Body faces
challenges as it deals with increasing
demand for its services and increasingly
complex disputes.
The Chair noted that the Appellate Body
has dealt with numerous trade-related
issues. Its “146 adopted reports, along
with more than 300 panel reports,
constitute tens of thousands of pages
of jurisprudence which is as wide in its
reach as it is deep in its probing of the
meaning of the covered agreements,”
he said.
However, the increasing number of
appeals means the Appellate Body
is facing difficulty in meeting the
requirement of “prompt” resolution
of disputes, a major feature that
distinguishes the WTO dispute
settlement system from other
international adjudicative systems.
Moreover, the mismatch between
Appellate Body resources and the
number, size and complexity of
appeals has significantly intensified,
the Chair said.
The resulting delays in handling appeals
have implications not only for the dispute
settlement process but also for the
WTO itself. Delays in dispute resolution
provide an incentive to those who benefit
from those delays. When delays in WTO
dispute resolution become the norm,

	

140

World Trade Organization  Annual Report 2018

they cast doubt on the value of the
WTO’s rules-oriented system itself,
the Chair warned.
Despite this, “there is much today in the
WTO’s dispute settlement system that
should be celebrated, not bemoaned.
The system at large, including the
Appellate Body, commands enormous
support and respect from its users. The
compliance rate with DSB rulings and
recommendations remains very high.
The increasing use of WTO case law
by other dispute settlement systems
testifies to the growing influence of the
WTO’s dispute settlement system on
international dispute settlement.”
The Chair reminded WTO members
that the WTO’s dispute settlement
system should not be taken for
granted and that it required nurturing
through timely interventions when
problem areas emerge.
Finally, the Chair noted particular
developments in the WTO dispute
settlement system in 2016. First, the
appeal rate of panel reports over the
previous ten years was 68 per cent;
in 2016 it was 88 per cent. Second,
the Chair noted the increasing number,
complexity and duration of proceedings
regarding compliance with dispute
settlement rulings (Article 21.5 of the
Dispute Settlement Understanding).

Three vacancies in
the Appellate Body

Appeals

Ricardo Ramírez Hernández of Mexico
and Peter Van den Bossche of Belgium
completed their second terms of office
on 30 June and 11 December 2017,
respectively. In line with Rule 15 of
the Working Procedures for Appellate
Review, they are continuing to complete
the appeals they were assigned while
they were still members of the Appellate
Body. Hyun Chong Kim of Korea
resigned from the Appellate Body on
1 August 2017.
Members were unable to agree by the
end of 2017 on the appointment of
Appellate Body members to fill the three
vacancies.
As of 31 December 2017, the four
Appellate Body members were:
• Ujal Singh Bhatia (India) (2011-19),
Chair of the Appellate Body in 2017

Thomas R. Graham

• Thomas R. Graham (United States)
(2011-19)
• Shree Baboo Chekitan Servansing
(Mauritius) (2014-18)
• Hong Zhao (China) (2016-20)

Shree Baboo Chekitan Servansing

Eight appeal proceedings were
initiated in 2017 (see Figure 2 and
Table 5). The Appellate Body’s work on
one appeal filed in 2016 continued
during 2017.
Six Appellate Body reports concerning
five matters were circulated in 2017
(see Figure 3 and Table 6). In addressing
these appeals, the Appellate Body
clarified several issues of systemic
significance. These included issues arising
under the Anti-Dumping Agreement,
the Agreement on the Application of
Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures,
the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade 1994, the Agreement on Import
Licensing Procedures and the Subsidies
and Countervailing Measures Agreement.
Since its inception, the Appellate Body
has circulated 150 reports.
In addition, in 2017 one arbitration
award concerning the reasonable
period of time for implementation
of Dispute Settlement Body
recommendations and rulings was
completed and a second arbitration
was initiated.
With the current vacancies on the
Appellate Body and a shortage of
lawyers to assist Appellate Body
members, three of the appeal
proceedings initiated in 2017 were
on hold, as of the end of 2017, until
preceding appeals are completed
and resources become available.

Supporting development and building trade capacity

T rade and
development
•	 The Committee on Trade and Development continued
its work on the link between trade and development.
•	 T
 he Committee looked at implementation of ministerial
instructions on duty-free and quota-free market
access for least-developed countries.
•	 A Secretariat report showed developing country
share of world trade slipped in 2016.

Background on trade
and development
The Committee on Trade and
Development is the focal point for
the coordination of all work on
trade and development issues in
the WTO. The Committee deals
with a variety of issues, including
all developmental issues, technical
cooperation and training, and
notifications under the Enabling
Clause, which allows developed
countries to give more favourable
treatment to developing countries.

WTO members considered a number
of submissions under a ministerial
mandate for the Committee on Trade
and Development to undertake focused
work on the link between trade and
development. It also considered
a number of proposals relating to
electronic commerce and continued
discussion of duty-free and quotafree (DFQF) market access for leastdeveloped countries (LDCs) and the
monitoring mechanism for special
and differential treatment (S&D)
for developing countries in WTO
agreements and decisions.
Cambodia – the Coordinator of the LDC
Group – recalled that the group had
submitted in 2016 a revised proposal
concerning the draft terms of reference
for a Secretariat study on DFQF
implementation. The Secretariat has
so far not been able to issue its report
on members’ DFQF market access
for LDCs, as mandated in the Bali
Ministerial Decision, because of
divergent views about the scope and
coverage of the report.

There are direct
references to WTO
activities in many
of the SDGs, ranging
from ensuring
food security to
promoting sustainable
economic growth.

Several members presented papers on
e-commerce, including the promotion
and facilitation of cross-border trade in
goods, payments and logistics services,
electronic signatures and their role in the
digital identity of users, online security
and access to online payments as well
as the infrastructure gaps that exist in
developing countries.
The WTO Secretariat reported that the
share of developing economies in world

	

146

World Trade Organization  Annual Report 2018

merchandise trade contracted in 2016
to 42.5 per cent for exports and 39.7
per cent for imports, down by around
1 per cent compared with 2014.
This marked a slowdown from the swift
growth of the early 2000s.
Trade’s role in promoting sustainable
development was an important topic
at the WTO’s annual Public Forum
in Geneva (see page 166). Both
governments and the private sector need
to be more active in ensuring trade’s full
potential in contributing to the United
Nations’ Sustainable Development
Goals (SDGs), the Forum heard.
There are direct references to WTO
activities in many of the SDGs, ranging
from ensuring food security and
sustainable agriculture to conserving
marine resources and promoting
inclusive and sustainable economic
growth. There are also references to
the value of the trading system itself in
supporting economic stability, which is
essential for growth and development.
The SDGs are a set of 17 goals and
169 targets that members of the United
Nations endorsed as part of the 2030
Agenda for Sustainable Development.
The Committee held two dedicated
sessions on the monitoring mechanism
on S&D. The mechanism acts as a focal
point to review the implementation of
S&D in WTO agreements and decisions,
as decided by ministers in Bali in 2013.
Ministers declared that monitoring
should be on the basis of written inputs
or submissions. However, no written
submissions had yet been received.

Trade and development
www.wto.org/development

-----------------------Page 148 End-----------------------

In the discussions, delegations differed
on whether to proceed with a review or
wait until there was concrete experience
of its use.

The Committee
reviewed the
implementation
of special and
differential treatment
for developing
countries in
WTO agreements
and decisions.

In a session dedicated to regional trade
agreements, WTO members considered
the agreement between the Association
of Southeast Asian Nations and India.
The Committee received a report on the
51st session of the Joint Advisory Group
(JAG) of the International Trade Centre.
The JAG is the policy-making body of the
trade promotion agency for developing
countries jointly sponsored by the WTO
and the United Nations Conference on
Trade and Development.

Market access
The Committee received notifications
under the Enabling Clause (see page
110) concerning an agreement between
India and Thailand, an agreement
between MERCOSUR (the Southern
Common Market) and the Southern
African Customs Union, and the
accession of Egypt to the Common
Market for Eastern and Southern

Africa. A notification under the Enabling
Clause was also circulated on behalf
of Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Mexico,
Paraguay and Uruguay, members of the
Latin American Integration Association.
In addition, the United States made
a notification of its trade preference
scheme for Nepal.

Technical cooperation
and training
The WTO Secretariat undertook about
350 technical assistance activities in
2017. Overall, 18,500 participants were
trained (see page 160).
The biennial technical assistance and
training plan for 2018 and 2019, which
defines the strategy and priorities, was
adopted by the Committee. Members
discussed an external evaluation of
the WTO’s technical assistance.
The evaluation found that the WTO’s
technical assistance is relevant and
aligned to the needs and priorities
of beneficiaries.

Supporting development and building trade capacity

Lea s t- develop ed
cou nt r ie s
•	 Market access was a key element in discussions in the
Sub-Committee.
•	 Least-developed countries (LDCs) expressed concern
about continuing percentage decline in their exports
of goods and services and widening trade deficit.
•	 LDCs urged WTO members to increase efforts to
implement ministerial decisions intended to boost
LDC trade.
•	 LDCs continued to benefit from technical assistance and
were among the biggest users of WTO e-learning courses.

Background on
least-developed
countries (LDCs)
The Sub-Committee on LDCs,
established in July 1995 as a
subsidiary body to the Committee
on Trade and Development, focuses
its work based on an agreed WTO
work programme for LDCs. This
work programme looks at a number
of systemic issues of importance
to LDCs in the multilateral trading
system, such as market access,
technical assistance and accession
to the WTO.

Enhanced integration
of the LDCs into
the multilateral
trading system is an
institutional priority.

Market access for LDCs
Market access for least-developed
countries (LDCs) was a central element
of the discussions in the meetings of the
Sub-Committee on LDCs in 2017 as it
continued its examination of systemic
issues of interest to LDCs.
The WTO Secretariat’s yearly report on
trends in LDC trade and market access
conditions showed that LDCs’ exports of
goods and services fell by a further 3.9
per cent in 2016, after losing 24 per cent
in 2015. Their share of world exports
declined to 0.91 per cent and their
collective trade deficit widened to US$
92.9 billion from US$ 87 billion in 2015.
Unfavourable developments in the prices
of primary commodities continue to have
an adverse impact on the export growth
of LDCs, the report said.
The LDCs expressed concern that they
were far from achieving the target of
doubling their share in world exports
by 2020 as envisaged under the UN
Istanbul Programme of Action for the
LDCs and the Sustainable Development
Goals (SDGs). They called on WTO
members to increase their efforts in
implementing ministerial decisions taken
in favour of LDCs, including the Nairobi
decision on preferential rules of origin to
make it easier for LDC exports to qualify
for preferential market access. They
also urged members to help them take
advantage of the LDC services waiver

	

148

World Trade Organization  Annual Report 2018

so as to increase their participation
in services trade (see page 97).

Technical assistance
and capacity building
The Sub-Committee monitors the
progress of WTO trade related technical
assistance provided to LDCs as well as
other capacity building initiatives.
The WTO Secretariat attaches priority
to LDCs in the delivery of its technical
assistance (see page 160). LDCs were
invited to over 70 per cent of all activities
in 2016. LDCs, especially from Africa,
were among the biggest users of WTO
e learning courses, accounting for a third
of participants in 2016. LDCs highlighted
the usefulness of internship programmes
at the WTO and at LDC missions, as
well as of LDC-specific courses and the
WTO reference centre programme.
The Executive Secretariat of the
Enhanced Integrated Framework (EIF),
which assists LDCs in integrating
trade into their national development
strategies, updated the Sub Committee
on the activities under Phase Two of the
EIF Programme (see page 156).
The LDCs highlighted the importance
of the EIF for building their trade
capacities and called upon development
partners to continue supporting the EIF,
including through contributions to the
EIF Trust Fund.

Least‑developed countries

-----------------------Page 150 End-----------------------

The Secretariat of the Standards and
Trade Development Facility (STDF)
provided a detailed account of its recent
activities in LDCs, highlighting that LDCs
were benefitting from 65 per cent of
STDF project funds (see page 158).

Accession of
LDCs to the WTO
The WTO Secretariat provided an
overview of the state of play in working
parties on LDC accessions and on
assistance provided to LDCs during and
post-accession (see page 36). Currently,
eight LDCs are in the process of joining
the WTO (Bhutan, Comoros, Ethiopia,
São Tomé and Príncipe, Somalia,
South Sudan, Sudan and Timor-Leste).
The two most recent LDC accessions
are Afghanistan and Liberia, who joined
the WTO in 2016.

WTO members, including acceding
LDCs, appreciated the Secretariat’s
assistance in support of LDC accessions
and highlighted the usefulness of
accession-related events in Siem Reap,
Cambodia, in March 2017, and Nairobi,
Kenya, in August 2017, in terms of
networking and experience-sharing.

South-South Dialogue on
LDCs and Development
In March, Deputy Director-General
David Shark and China’s Vice Minister
of Commerce, Shouwen Wang, signed
a Memorandum of Understanding
extending the China Programme for
another year. Established in 2011, the
programme aims to strengthen the
participation of LDCs in WTO trade
negotiations and to assist LDCs in
joining the WTO.
DDG Shark said: “Enhanced integration
of LDCs into the multilateral trading
system is an institutional priority.”
Under China’s LDCs and Accessions
Programme, the LDC Group engaged
with other developing countries and
international agencies in a dialogue on
LDCs and development in Montreux,
Switzerland, in November 2017. The
dialogue provided a platform for LDCs
and developing country trade partners
to discuss developments in LDC issues
and questions to be taken up at the
11th WTO Ministerial Conference in
Buenos Aires at the end of 2017 as
well as growing cooperation between
developing countries.

•	 The Committee on Trade and Development continued
in two dedicated sessions to examine the impact of
WTO rules on small, vulnerable economies (SVEs).
•	 S
 VEs presented a summary of discussions of a WTO
Secretariat paper on the challenges and opportunities
SVEs face in linking to global value chains.
•	 The Secretariat reported on the challenges SVEs face
in reducing trade costs.
•	 Ministers agreed in Buenos Aires to continue the
WTO’s work on SVEs.

Background on
small economies
The Committee on Trade and
Development – in dedicated
sessions – oversees work on
small economies and monitors
the progress of proposals from
small, vulnerable economies in
the various WTO bodies and
negotiating groups. Several small
economies are small island states.

The Committee on Trade and
Development held two dedicated
sessions in 2017 on small, vulnerable
economies (SVEs) and the traderelated constraints they face. At the
session on 17 May, the SVE Group
presented the outcome of discussions
on a WTO Secretariat research paper
– “Challenges and opportunities
experienced by small economies when
linking into global value chains in trade
in goods and services”. The Secretariat
document had also been discussed in
2015 and 2016.
The SVEs presented a summary of the
discussions, focusing on the specific
challenges that SVE face and some
recommendations on how to mitigate
challenges in the areas of agrifood,
seafood, textiles and apparel in goods
value chains, tourism, information
technology (IT), business process
outsourcing and trade logistics in
services value chains. The proponents
intended to use this document and its
recommendations as a guide to seek
action in the appropriate committees
within the WTO.
The SVE Group will work on an
action plan to start applying such
recommendations and will seek the
assistance of the WTO Secretariat
as well as other organizations, such
as the United Nations Conference
on Trade and Development and the
International Trade Centre.

World Trade Organization  Annual Report 2018

The Secretariat also introduced a
document on the “Challenges and
opportunities experienced by small
economies in their efforts to reduce trade
costs, particularly in the area of trade
facilitation”, mandated by the Nairobi
Ministerial Conference in 2015. This
paper analysed best practices and policy
approaches to enhance productive
capacity and export competitiveness.
Regarding trade facilitation, the paper
found that the implementation of the
WTO’s Trade Facilitation Agreement
(see page 94) will make a significant
contribution to reducing trade costs.
Several SVEs shared their national
experiences on these issues.
SVEs are those WTO members that
account for only a small percentage of
world trade. WTO members recognize
that these economies, while not forming
an official sub-category of members,
face specific challenges due to their
size and the distances that can separate
them from their key trading partners.
At the 11th Ministerial Conference
in 2017 in Buenos Aires, ministers
reaffirmed their commitment to the Work
Programme on Small Economies and
took note of all the work conducted
to date. They instructed the WTO
Secretariat to provide relevant
information and factual analysis for
discussion among members in the
Committee’s dedicated sessions and
to continue its work on the challenges
that small economies experience in their
efforts to reduce trade costs, particularly
in the area of trade facilitation.

Aid for T rade
•	 The WTO hosted the 2017 Global Review of Aid for
Trade on the theme “Promoting Trade, Inclusiveness
and Connectivity for Sustainable Development”.
•	 Aid for Trade disbursements amounted to
US$ 38.77 billion in 2016, taking the 2006-16
total to US$ 342.35 billion.
•	 At the Global Review, WTO members reaffirmed their
commitment to Aid for Trade and to development support.
•	 An OECD-WTO co-publication, Aid for Trade at a
Glance, emphasizes that developing countries need
to increase connectivity and improve infrastructure
to benefit from trade.

Background on
Aid for Trade

The 2017 Global Review of Aid for Trade,
held on 11-13 July, attracted more than
1,500 participants (see page 154). It
focused on helping developing countries
connect to export markets, following
up on the message of the 2015 Global
Review that high trade costs create
substantial obstacles to trade.

WTO members launched the
Aid for Trade initiative at the
Sixth Ministerial Conference
in Hong Kong in 2005. Aid for
Trade focuses on supporting
developing countries, particularly
the least developed, in building
trade capacity, enhancing their
infrastructure and improving
their ability to benefit from tradeopening opportunities.

The 2016-17 Aid for Trade work
programme sought to build on this
message, analysing the impact of trade
costs on the integration of developing
countries into global value chains and
addressing issues such as empowering
women and meeting the needs of
micro, small and medium-sized
enterprises (MSMEs).

Provisional estimates indicate that
in 2016 disbursements of Aid for
Trade totalled US$ 38.77 billion,
according to figures from the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation
and Development (OECD), compared
with US$ 40.31 billion in 2015 (see
Figure 1). Commitments stood at
US$ 51.03 billion.
Total disbursements over the period
2006-16 amounted to US$ 342.35
billion. A total of 146 developing
countries have benefited from this
support – mainly in Africa and Asia –
with 17 per cent of financing going to
least-developed countries (LDCs).

The Aid for Trade
Global Review
attracted more than
1,500 participants.

New publication
The OECD and the WTO released
a joint publication – Aid for Trade at a
Glance: Promoting Trade, Inclusiveness
and Connectivity for Sustainable
Development – during the Global
Review. The publication focuses on
the importance of trade connectivity
and contains contributions from other
international organizations, including
the World Bank and the United Nations
Conference on Trade and Development
(UNCTAD). It brings together insights
from the 111 questionnaires and 145
case stories submitted in response to
the monitoring and evaluation exercise.

Aid for Trade success story:
Busia One-Stop Border Post
A project funded by TradeMark East
Africa and highlighted by the Aid for
Trade initiative established a one-stop
border post at Busia between eastern
Uganda and western Kenya. The project
aimed to reduce the time taken to
cross the busy border by combining
clearance activities into a single location,

simplifying procedures, increasing
cooperation and coordination of controls
and sharing data and intelligence.
At the Global Review of Aid for Trade,
Uganda’s Minister of Trade, Industry
and Cooperatives, Amelia Kyambadde,
said that customs procedures that
previously took up to 18 days are now
completed in a matter of hours.

Workshops and
regional activities
The Committee held two workshops
– one on “Aid for Trade, Trade Costs
Indices and Design and Implementation
of Policies to Reduce Trade Costs”
and the other reviewing the results
of the 2017 Aid for Trade monitoring
and evaluation exercise. The WTO
Secretariat reported on three regional
activities on Aid for Trade held in Dakar,
Senegal, for Africa, in Incheon, Korea,
for Asia and the Pacific and in Miami for
the Caribbean.

A TradeMark East Africa time and
traffic survey, conducted in June 2016,
shows that significant results have been
achieved. The average time it takes to
cross Kenya has fallen by some 80 per
cent, government revenues have risen
and importers are now able to make
more round trips.

Global Rev iew
of Aid for
T rade 2017
The WTO hosted the sixth Aid for Trade Global Review
on “Promoting Trade, Inclusiveness and Connectivity
for Sustainable Development”. Some 1,500 trade and
development professionals attended the 11-13 July
conference, which underlined the important part
played by trade – and the key role of Aid for Trade –
in delivering growth, reducing poverty and achieving
the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals.

Among the topics
debated was the
importance of
empowering women
by removing barriers
to their participation
in global trade.

Aja Fatoumatta Jallow Tambajang,
Vice President of the Gambia, opened
the Global Review by outlining how
building trade capacity, improving
competitiveness and strengthening
public-private partnership is a high
priority for the Gambia. Her emphasis
on the need to promote trade
inclusiveness for sustainable
development was echoed by many of the
more than 40 ministers, vice-ministers
and heads of international organizations
who attended.
The biennial event provides a platform
for high-level discussions on the Aid for
Trade initiative, which aims to develop
the trading capacity of developing
countries and least-developed countries
(LDCs – see page 148). A total of 55
sessions were held over the three days,
reflecting the broad range of topics that
the initiative and its work programme
address. Among the topics debated by
the more than 1,500 participants was the
importance of empowering women by
removing barriers to their participation
in global trade (see page 108).

message of the Fifth Global Review
that high trade costs create substantial
obstacles to trade.
Sessions highlighted successful
examples of trade facilitation reforms.
A live video link was made with the Busia
one-stop border post between Kenya
and Uganda, where customs procedures
that previously took up to 18 days now
take a matter of hours. A case study
competition underlined the importance of
trade facilitation, with joint prize winners
announced from Zambia and Jamaica for
their success in, respectively, reducing
border goods inspections and promoting
public-private cooperation in improving
competitiveness.
The review also showcased the

highlighted the constraints faced by
developing countries and LDCs in
participating in trade, particularly online.
Angel Gurría, Secretary-General of the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation

Trade’s benefits and efforts to enhance
connectivity must also reach women,
International Trade Centre Executive
Director Arancha González told
the opening session. “Despite the
proliferation of mobile phones, there are
still far too many, especially women, who
are unconnected to the information grid,”
she said.
Sweden’s Minister for European Union
Affairs and Trade, Ann Linde, underlined
the importance of bridging the digital
divide for women. “Gender equality
doesn’t only improve women’s lives,
it’s fundamental for economic growth
and development,” she told a high-level
plenary on gender and trade.

•	 The Enhanced Integrated Framework (EIF) accelerated
its roll-out of projects, approving 23 new projects
to help least-developed countries (LDCs) use trade
as a tool for growth.
•	 Pledges to phase two of the EIF programme stand
at US$ 115 million.
•	 The EIF had invested in 176 projects by the end of 2017,
with over US$ 222 million committed to supporting 51
of the poorest countries in the world.
Background on the
Enhanced Integrated
Framework
The EIF is the only global Aid
for Trade programme dedicated
exclusively to addressing the trade
capacity needs of LDCs. It is
supported by a multi-donor trust
fund and provides financial and
technical support to build trade
capacity in LDCs to help them use
trade as a tool for economic growth
and poverty reduction. The EIF
is a partnership of LDCs, donors
and partner agencies, including
the WTO, the World Bank, the
International Monetary Fund, the
UN Development Programme,
the UN Conference on Trade and
Development, the International
Trade Centre, the UN World Tourism
Organization and the UN Industrial
Development Organization, The
WTO houses the EIF.

Twenty-three new EIF projects were
approved in 2017 to help LDCs develop
their trading capacity and to provide
policy framework support. New projects
were launched in Bangladesh, Bhutan,
Burkina Faso, Comoros, Djibouti,
Equatorial Guinea, The Gambia, Guinea,
Liberia, Haiti, Mauritania, Nepal, Samoa,
South Sudan, Solomon Islands, Uganda
and Vanuatu.
By the end of 2017, the EIF had invested
in 176 projects, with over US$ 222
million committed to supporting 51 of the
world’s poorest countries across Africa,
Asia, the Americas and the Pacific.
This compares with 142 projects and
commitments worth US$ 202 million at
the end of 2016.
So far, US$ 115 million has been
secured for the second phase of the
EIF, which runs from 2016 to 2022,
and efforts will continue to meet the
target of at least US$ 274 million. One
of the aims of the EIF has been to help
women benefit more directly from trade
opportunities. To date, EIF projects have
ensured that 35,000 women can earn a
regular income through trade.
In 2017, the European Union pledged
EUR 10 million to the EIF while the
United Kingdom agreed to provide
US$ 21 million. The EIF also received
contributions from Denmark, Finland,
France, Germany, Luxembourg, the
Netherlands, Norway, Saudi Arabia
and Sweden. Strategic partnerships

were established with the Islamic
Development Bank Group and with the
UN Food and Agriculture Organization.
EIF Executive Director Ratnakar Adhikari
said the commitments will help LDCs
ready themselves for paradigm shifts
in the global economy, including the
growing trend in e-commerce. The EIF’s
success so far “does not mean that the
work is done. Rather, it is a reminder of
how important this work is — and how
much more focus it deserves”.

Examples of EIF projects
Equatorial Guinea is undertaking
a diagnostic trade integration study
as it seeks to move away from
dependence on oil. These studies
help countries identify and address
constraints to trade, economic growth
and sustainable development.
Likewise, Vanuatu is updating its National
Trade Policy Framework with support
from the EIF. The EIF is also assisting
South Sudan in producing its first
national trade policy and is supporting
the country’s WTO accession process.
In addition, the EIF is financing the
preparation of e-trade readiness
assessments in Liberia, Nepal, Samoa,
the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu.
EIF capacity-building projects are

objectives into trade projects.
Investments in honey production
in Zambia, for example, are helping
to preserve the biodiversity of the
country’s forests.

Results from the investments so far
include the doubling of processed
mango exports from Burkina Faso and
a threefold increase in rice exports
from Cambodia.

The EIF has invested
over US$ 222 million
to support 51
of the world’s
poorest countries.

In Malawi, an EIF project is generating
almost US$ 800,000 in income for
3,500 smallholder farmers. Through
better farming practices, farmers are
able to receive double the market
price for their products and increase
their exports by working collectively.
Increased incomes are helping to
support improvements to the education
of children and the construction of
houses and small businesses.
An EIF project has supported over
1,600 micro, small and medium-sized
enterprises (MSMEs) in Uganda,
bringing almost 500 small businesses
into the formal sector and leading to
the registration of over 700 production
cooperatives.

Collaboration and
partnerships
The EIF has partnered with the
International Trade Centre to support
better mainstreaming of environmental

In 2017, the EIF joined forces with
FAO to bring together the trade and
agriculture ministries from four African
countries to give additional impetus
to the mainstreaming of trade into
agricultural development policies.
The initial results of this initiative were
showcased at the Global Review of Aid
for Trade in July.
The EIF published a joint study with
the Standards and Trade Development
Facility on how sanitary and
phytosanitary issues are addressed in
trade diagnostic studies. In addition, the
EIF works regularly with WTO divisions
in following up on members’ trade
policy reviews and in providing training
activities and other support. The EIF has
also worked to ensure there is a strong
LDC voice in the new Global Trade
Professionals Alliance, which seeks to
build networks of trade professionals
and develop their skills, and has
strengthened cooperation with the
Islamic Development Bank to promote
exports of LDCs.
During 2017, the EIF launched
“Trade for Development News”
(http://trade4devnews.enhancedif.org),
to raise awareness of Aid for Trade
projects across the LDCs.

•	 Together with the UN Food and Agriculture Organization,
the STDF began a project aimed at helping developing
countries send and receive phytosanitary certificates
electronically.
•	 S
 ince 2004, over US$ 43 million has been provided
through STDF funding and other mobilized resources
to support projects in least-developed and other lowincome countries.
Background on the
Standards and Trade
Development Facility
The STDF is a global partnership
that helps developing countries
build their sanitary and
phytosanitary capacity and
their ability to gain and maintain
market access. The STDF
contributes to broader sustainable
development goals, such as
enhanced economic growth,
poverty reduction, food security
and environmental protection.
Established by the WTO,
the UN Food and Agriculture
Organization, the World
Organisation for Animal Health,
the World Bank Group and the
World Health Organization, the
STDF is financed by voluntary
contributions. The WTO houses
the Secretariat and manages the
STDF trust fund.

Improving trading capacity
in developing countries
Nine project grants and seven project
preparation grants (PPGs) were
approved by the STDF in 2017, totalling
US$ 4.2 million.
These projects and PPGs aim to improve
the capacity of the public and private
sectors in developing countries to
meet international standards for food
safety, plant and animal health and to
access international markets. They
include projects to facilitate livestock
exports from Ethiopia, to strengthen
Zambia’s capacity to export plant-based
products, and to mainstream sanitary
and phytosanitary (SPS) investments
in policy and planning frameworks in
selected countries of the Common
Market for Eastern and Southern Africa
(COMESA). The Zambia and COMESA
projects will benefit from co-financing
provided by the Enhanced Integrated
Framework (see page 156).
New PPGs include the preparation
of a feasibility study to evaluate the

value addition in Sri Lanka’s fruit and
vegetable sector and the development
of a project proposal to reduce aflatoxin
contamination in maize in Burkina Faso.
Since 2004, the STDF has provided

in Francophone Africa. In July 2017, the
STDF held a high-level session at the
2017 Aid for Trade Global Review (see
page 154) on electronic certification,
new technologies and supply-chain
traceability and trade facilitation/
single windows.
In November, findings from two PPGs
on controlling foot and mouth disease in
Tanzania and Zimbabwe were presented
on the sidelines of the WTO’s SPS

Committee. Challenges in setting
up disease-free zones in developing
countries and the need for more
resources were highlighted.
In 2017, the STDF Secretariat shared
experiences and lessons from the
STDF’s work at over 50 conferences
and SPS capacity-building workshops
worldwide. Presentations were given
on electronic SPS certification,
implementation of the Trade Facilitation
Agreement (see page 94) in relation
to its SPS compliance, prioritizing
SPS investments for market access
and the impact of STDF work on
poverty reduction, women’s economic
empowerment, food security and other
cross-cutting issues.
New briefing notes showcasing
synergies across STDF project and
thematic work were disseminated.
Topics addressed were public-private
partnerships for SPS capacity building,
electronic SPS certification and the
use of SPS capacity evaluation tools
developed by STDF partners
in developing countries.
The STDF also conducted a survey
on Good Regulatory Practice to
identify opportunities to improve the
development and implementation of
SPS measures in developing countries.
With further analysis, the findings will
contribute to ongoing discussions on
how to improve the development and
implementation of SPS measures
to ensure health protection and

Advanced courses for specialists were
organized on various subjects, including
trade-related intellectual property rights,
sanitary and phytosanitary issues,
agriculture, import licensing, dispute
settlement, regional trade agreements
and trade in services. Three Genevabased advanced trade policy courses,
each one lasting eight weeks, were
held in 2017 for generalists. Courses
for generalists and specialists were
also offered at the introductory and
intermediate levels, including in areas
of specific interest to LDCs. Generalists
are government officials, including
Geneva delegates, who require a broad
knowledge of many WTO subjects.
The WTO also organized regional
activities. Eight-week regional trade
policy courses were held for generalists
in five regions: French-speaking Africa,
Asia and the Pacific, the Caribbean,
Latin America, and Arab and Middle East
countries. Specialist courses, sometimes
involving partner organizations, included:
a workshop on trade negotiations skills
for English-speaking African countries;

World Trade Organization  Annual Report 2018

preparatory workshops for the 11th
Ministerial Conference for Asia-Pacific
countries and for French-speaking
African countries; a regional workshop
for trade statisticians from Arab
countries, jointly organized with the
Arab Monetary Fund; a regional
workshop on government procurement
for Latin American countries; and a
regional workshop on trade policy
modelling for Central and Eastern
Europe, Central Asia and the Caucasus.
The WTO’s training activities are mostly
based on a biennial technical assistance
and training plan approved by the
Committee on Trade and Development.
The 2016-17 plan followed a “resultsbased management” approach,
measuring results to ensure that training
is delivered in the most effective way.
Courses are undertaken as part of
a progressive learning strategy so
that participants benefit from a stepby-step approach to improving their
awareness of trade issues. Guidelines
and benchmarks help to maintain a high
standard (see below) of content for
all training, consistent teaching methods
and regular evaluation of all technical
assistance activities delivered by
the WTO.
The WTO continued to involve
international and regional partners
in technical assistance activities to
ensure that a regional perspective was

included in the design of the training
programmes. Eighteen per cent of
activities were for the benefit of Asia
and the Pacific, 17 per cent for African
countries, 11 per cent for Latin America,
9 per cent for Central and Eastern
Europe and Central Asia, 5 per cent
for Arab and Middle East countries,
and 2 per cent for the Caribbean (see
Table 1). The remaining 39 per cent
were “global” activities, mostly held
in Geneva, aimed at participants from
all regions. In line with the demanddriven approach, approximately 32 per
cent of all activities were delivered at
the national level in countries where a
specific need was identified.

The number of face-to-face training
activities conducted by the WTO was
relatively stable in 2017 in comparison
with 2016, and the WTO Secretariat
continued to implement a targeted
approach to meet members’ needs.
LDCs were invited to approximately
60 per cent of all technical assistance
activities, maintaining a constant trend
over the last two years. Nearly half of
the participants accessed their training
through e-learning resources on the
WTO’s online platform.

Technical assistance was strengthened
for countries seeking to join the
WTO (see page 39 and Figure 5 above),
with government officials invited to
participate in approximately 140
technical assistance events.

Internship programmes
WTO internship programmes offer
government officials hands-on
experience in WTO activities.
The Netherlands Trainee Programme,
the French and Irish Missions Internship
Programme, the Regional Coordinator
Internship Programme and the
Accession Internship Programme give
priority to applicants from Africa and
LDCs, to small, vulnerable economies,
and to countries in the process of joining
the WTO.

Technical cooperation and training

-----------------------Page 164 End-----------------------

In 2017, the majority of officials
completing the WTO internship
programmes were from LDCs and other
low-income countries in Africa and
the Asia and Pacific regions. Fifteen
candidates completed the French and
Irish Missions Internship Programme,
16 candidates completed the
Netherlands Trainee Programme,
five candidates completed the
Regional Coordinator Internship
Programme and seven the Accession
Internship Programme.

Young Professionals
Programme
The Young Professionals Programme
was launched by DG Azevêdo in 2016
to increase the representation of
professionals from nationalities underrepresented at the WTO, with the aim
of improving their chances of being
recruited by the WTO and/or other
regional and international organizations.

Five young
professionals
became the first
participants in the
Young Professionals
Programme in 2017.

Technical cooperation and training
www.wto.org/technicalcooperation
	

Five young professionals – two from the
Dominican Republic and one each from
Chile, Chinese Taipei and Montenegro
– became the first participants in the
programme in January 2017 (see page
193). Following the success of the
programme, the WTO expanded the
intake to 15 participants in 2018. The
intake was from Antigua and Barbuda,
Armenia, Cameroon, El Salvador,
Georgia, Indonesia, Ivory Coast,
Kazakhstan, Madagascar, Mongolia,
Panama, Paraguay, St Vincent and
the Grenadines, Thailand and Togo.
The young professionals remain at
the WTO for one year.

Financing technical
assistance
The bulk of the technical assistance
programme is financed by the Doha
Development Agenda Global Trust Fund,
which receives voluntary contributions
from WTO members. The financial
position of the fund remains fairly strong
due to the balance carried forward from
2016 and funds received for 2017.
The Fund received CHF 6.2 million for
2017, contributed by 12 WTO members,
a decline of 10 per cent from the
CHF 6.9 million received in 2016.
Other funding sources include the
WTO’s regular budget for Geneva
based courses and national technical
assistance activities – approximately
CHF 4.5 million for 2017 – and
contributions from other trust funds
(such as the French and Irish Missions
Internship Programme, the Netherlands
Trainee Programme and the China
Programme), which totalled CHF 2.2
million for 2017.

External evaluation of
WTO technical assistance
The Committee on Trade and
Development discussed an external
evaluation of the WTO’s training
activities at a meeting in January 2017.
The report, issued in October 2016,
notes the success of the training
programme in helping developing
countries improve their capacity to
trade and makes recommendations on
how to further improve the programme
by making it even more transparent,
targeted and accountable.
“When the WTO was created over
two decades ago, technical assistance
was not a major part of our work. Fastforward to today and it constitutes one of
the biggest outputs of the organization.
It has become, unquestionably, a central
element of the WTO’s activities. This
is a real shift in the culture of the
organization and it is a priority for me,”
DG Azevêdo told the Committee. He
stressed that the independent evaluators’
recommendations will feed into the next
technical assistance plan.

P u bl ic For u m 2017
The 2017 Public Forum in September debated the realities
of trade by going beyond the rhetoric to look in detail at
the opportunities trade offers and the challenges it brings,
particularly for developing countries.

The Forum provided a platform for frank
discussions among policy-makers,
civil society representatives, business
people and researchers to consider how
to maximize the benefits of trade and
ensure the trading system is as inclusive
as it can be.

Under the theme “Trade: Behind the
Headlines”, the WTO’s premier outreach
event held 105 sessions – the most
ever – including two high-level plenary
sessions. The sessions related to three
sub-themes – trade and jobs, inclusive
trade and the Sustainable Development
Goals (SDGs). The 1,221 participants
(excluding WTO delegates and staff)
from 112 countries (both members
and non-members) were drawn from
civil society, business, government
and research institutions. Businesses
accounted for the largest proportion
of participants (16 per cent) ahead
of non-governmental organizations
(15 per cent) and government officials
(12 per cent) (see Figure 1). The
majority of participants came from
Europe, followed by Asia.

Keynote speakers at the opening plenary
made heartfelt pleas for a more inclusive
global trading system. “Even if you argue
– as I would – that trade is essential
for growth, development and jobs,
you have to accept that we drastically
underestimated people’s dissatisfaction
with the status quo,” said WTO DirectorGeneral Roberto Azevêdo, who led
the debate.
The high-level panel included Christine
Lagarde, Managing Director of the
International Monetary Fund, New York
Times columnist and Nobel Prize-winning
economist Paul Krugman, Argentine
minister Susana Malcorra, Bruce Stokes,
Director at the Pew Research Center,
Dr Naushad Forbes, Co-Chairman of
Forbes Marshall, and Strive Masiyiwa,
founder of the Econet Group.
The second high-level panel saw the
launch of the WTO’s flagship World
Trade Report (see page 182), which
examines how technology and trade
affect labour markets. High-level

The SDGs and trade’s role in achieving
them featured prominently in many
sessions. Participants looked at the
part played by agriculture and how
turning the SDGs into reality can create
new business opportunities. Another
important topic was how sustainable
development can be achieved through
the adoption of clean technologies.
Sessions debated how to create a more
open and inclusive trading system for
all, with better and fairer opportunities
for women. Ensuring that SMEs are
able to adapt to the new ways of doing
business, including e-commerce, was
also a key topic.

the authors discussed their books.
Several stands were set up, showcasing
products and work being carried out
by small businesses, international
organizations and institutions to help
countries and individuals share in the
benefits of trade. Among the exhibitors
was SPINNA Circle, which supports
the growth of women entrepreneurs

•	 Over 350 representatives from 170 nongovernmental organizations (NGOs)
attended the 11th Ministerial Conference.
•	 NGOs formed the second-largest group
of participants at the Public Forum.

Background on
relations with NGOs
The WTO maintains regular dialogue
with civil society organizations
through outreach activities, such
as regular briefings, to enhance
cooperation and increase awareness
of WTO activities and the multilateral
trading system. It provides a platform
for NGOs to discuss current trade
issues and provides them with access
to many WTO events.

Over 350 representatives of 170 nongovernmental organizations (NGOs)
attended the 11th WTO Ministerial
Conference in Buenos Aires in
December, where the WTO provided
a fully equipped NGO centre for their
exclusive use. NGOs organized side
events and received daily briefings from
the WTO Secretariat on the status of
the discussions. In Geneva, NGOs
received briefings throughout the year on
meetings of the General Council and the
Trade Negotiations Committee and on
other WTO activities.

Public Forum
The 2017 Public Forum (see page
166) attracted over 1,200 participants
from over 100 countries. NGOs
formed the second-largest group after
business, accounting for 15 per cent of
participants. NGOs organized sessions
on a variety of topics, including how
trade can help achieve gender equality
and how trade can fairly contribute to
economic growth and decent work for
marginalized communities.

Open hearings
In 2017, NGOs were able to attend
five dispute hearings relating to three
panels. Since 2005, certain panel
meetings, Appellate Body hearings and
arbitration proceedings have been open
to the public. The three panels were:
“United States – Supercalendered
Paper”, covering countervailing duties on
Canadian paper; a compliance dispute
brought by the European Union against
the United States over subsidies for
large aircraft – “European Communities
and Certain Member States – Large Civil
Aircraft (Article 21.5 – US)”; and “US –
Tax Incentives” for the manufacturing of
large civil aircraft, in a case brought by
the European Union.

CUTS International
organized a Public
Forum session on how
trade can contribute
to economic growth
and decent work
for marginalized
communities.

•	 The 2017 Parliamentary Conference on the WTO took
place ahead of the 11th WTO Ministerial Conference
in Buenos Aires.
•	 The conference urged WTO members to strive to
strengthen the multilateral trading system, with
the WTO as its cornerstone.

Background on contact
with parliamentarians
Parliamentarians play an important
role in the multilateral trading
system. Any deal resulting from
intergovernmental negotiations at
the WTO will, in most cases, need
approval from legislators. The
WTO seeks to maintain an open
dialogue with parliamentarians
and to help them gain a deeper
understanding of the organization
and its work.

The Parliamentary
Conference on the WTO
met at the National
Congress of Argentina
in Buenos Aires in
December 2017.

Contact with parliamentarians
www.wto.org/parliamentarians
	

The Parliamentary Conference on the
WTO, meeting on 9-10 December at
the National Congress of Argentina
in Buenos Aires, just before the 11th
WTO Ministerial Conference (MC11),
urged WTO members to make every
effort to strengthen the multilateral
trading system, with the WTO as
its cornerstone.
Members of Parliament (MPs) welcomed
the entry into force of the WTO Trade
Facilitation Agreement (see page 94)
and the amendment to the Traderelated Aspects of Intellectual Property
Agreement (see page 100) and urged
governments that have not yet ratified
these two instruments to do so as
speedily as possible.
Addressing the conference, attended by
hundreds of MPs from around the world,
Director-General Roberto Azevêdo said:
“You play a fundamental role here. We
rely on you, through platforms like this, to
pass on the cares and concerns of your
communities. And we rely on you to help
inform them about the work of the WTO.”

The Steering Committee of the InterParliamentary Union (IPU) on WTO
matters met in March in Brussels and
in Geneva during the WTO Public
Forum (see page 166). The IPU is the
international organization of parliaments.
Senior WTO staff, the Chair of the
General Council (see page 62)
and Geneva-based ambassadors
briefed legislators on important issues
facing the multilateral trading system.
Deputy Director-General (DDG)
David Shark and DDG Karl Brauner
addressed the Committee.
A parliamentary session was held during
the Public Forum (see page 166) on
“Making trade fair: the contribution
of parliaments”. Speakers included
members of the European Parliament
and members of national assemblies
from Pakistan and Cameroon.

Regional workshops
and meetings
In 2017, the WTO organized four
regional workshops for parliamentarians:
in Vienna (co-organized with the Joint
Vienna Institute) for MPs from Central
European, Central Asian and the
Caucasus countries; in Rabat, Morocco
(organized jointly with the Assemblée
Parlementaire de la Méditerranée) for
MPs from the Mediterranean area;
in Madagascar (with the Organization
Internationale de la Francophonie) for
African MPs; and in Singapore (with the
TEMASEK Foundation) for MPs from
Asia. The four events drew 107 MPs.

Background on
cooperation with
other international
organizations
The WTO works closely with other
intergovernmental organizations
and regional bodies, especially
those involved in trade-related
issues. This cooperation helps
to ensure coordinated action
and a consistent approach to
international trade policies.

G20 leaders
underlined the
crucial role of
the rules-based
international
trading system.

G20
In July, Director-General Roberto
Azevêdo attended the summit of the
G20 group of leading developed and
developing countries in Hamburg,
Germany. In a statement released
ahead of the summit, DG Azevêdo, the
Managing Director of the International
Monetary Fund (IMF), Christine Lagarde,
and World Bank President Jim Yong Kim
stressed that the economic well-being of
billions of people depends on trade and
that deeper trade integration coupled
with supportive domestic policies can
help boost incomes and accelerate
global growth.
G20 leaders underlined the crucial
role of the rules-based international
trading system. They also vowed to
keep markets open and to continue to
fight protectionism, including all unfair
trade practices, recognizing the role of
legitimate trade defence instruments in
this regard.
With the United Nations Conference
on Trade and Development (UNCTAD)
and the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development
(OECD), the WTO continued to
publish six-monthly reports on trade and
investment measures in G20 countries.
The November report showed the

	

170

World Trade Organization  Annual Report 2018

introduction of fewer trade-restrictive
measures compared with the previous
review period.
The WTO contributed a range of inputs
to trade discussions, notably in the G20
sherpa track and in the G20 Trade and
Investment Working Group, which seeks
to better coordinate efforts to reinforce
trade and investment. Together with
the OECD and the World Bank, the
WTO organized a conference in Paris
bringing together G20 policy-makers and
researchers to review current knowledge
on the distribution of the gains from
trade. Jointly with the IMF and the World
Bank, the WTO provided a background
document, “Making Trade an Engine of
Growth for All” (see page 121).

OECD
DG Azevêdo addressed the OECD
Ministerial Council on 8 June, telling
the meeting that the WTO’s success
over the past few years in delivering
agreements needs to be maintained
so that trade can do even more to
create jobs and support growth
and development.
The OECD and the WTO cooperate in
a wide range of areas, including in the
Trade in Value-Added (TiVA) database,
launched in 2013. They also cooperate

to improve the measurement of digital
trade. In 2017, the WTO ran for the first
time a course on global value chains
supported by the OECD (see page 185).
The OECD and WTO are also
cooperating in the development of a
set of trade facilitation indicators (TFIs).
This interactive web tool covers 152
countries. The TFIs identify areas for
action and assess the potential impact
of trade facilitation reforms so that
governments can prioritize action and
mobilize technical assistance.

United Nations
DG Azevêdo attended the spring
meeting of the United Nations Chief
Executives Board (CEB) – a high-level
body composed of the executive heads
of UN agencies, funds and programmes
as well as the executive heads of the
IMF, the World Bank and the WTO.
The CEB aims to enhance international
cooperation on global issues.
The WTO is part of the UN Secretary
General-led High-Level Task Force,
which brings together 23 UN agencies
and international organizations to
improve coordination in global food
security responses. The task force
offers high-level policy coordination
and political leadership, with the aim of
achieving the Sustainable Development
Goals (SDGs) related to food and
nutrition security and to sustainable
agriculture and food systems.

Cooperation with other international organizations
www.wto.org/otherorgs
	

The WTO also works closely with
departments of the UN Secretariat,
especially on the follow-up and
implementation of the trade-related
targets in the Agenda 2030 for
Sustainable Development. In 2017, the
WTO made several contributions to
this work, among them an issue brief
for the 2017 High Level Political Forum
on Sustainable Development, which
included policy recommendations on
ways to accelerate progress in poverty
eradication from a trade perspective.
During the Aid for Trade Global Review
(see page 154) the UN’s Food and
Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the
WTO unveiled a joint publication on trade
and food standards (see page 181).
The WTO’s collaboration with the UN
Office of the High Representative for the
Least Developed Countries, Landlocked
Developing Countries and the Small
Island Developing States (UN-OHRLLS)
has continued to strengthen. The WTO
regularly contributes to the UN Secretary
General’s reports on the implementation
of the Istanbul Programme of Action for
the Least Developed Countries as well
as the Vienna Programme of Action for
Landlocked Developing Countries.
The WTO works closely with UNCTAD
and the International Trade Centre
ITC. During the WTO 11th Ministerial
Conference (MC11) in Buenos Aires, they
launched an innovative web-based tool
to help businesses, in particular smaller
firms, benefit from trade.

programme. The 51st session of the
JAG was held in July at the WTO.

The ILO and the WTO
launched a joint study
on “Investing in Skills
for Inclusive Trade.”

The WTO and UNCTAD continue to
cooperate in providing training and
technical assistance to developing
countries and least developed
countries (LDCs), building on the
declaration signed by DG Azevêdo and
UNCTAD Secretary-General Mukhisa
Kituyi in October 2015 to strengthen
collaboration between the two
organizations. The WTO also cooperates
with UNCTAD within the framework of
the UN inter-agency “cluster” on trade
and productive capacity, which aims
to coordinate trade and development

World Trade Organization  Annual Report 2018

In 2017, the International Labour
Organization (ILO) and the WTO
launched a joint study – Investing
in Skills for Inclusive Trade – which
suggested that enhancing the skills of
a country’s workforce lifts the export
performance of its enterprises and
better prepares them to meet foreign
competition (see page 183).
The WTO Secretariat attends sessions
of the ILO Governing Body and the
International Labour Conference as an
observer and participates in meetings of
the Governing Body’s Working Party on
the Social Dimension of Globalization.
The ILO and the WTO are undertaking
research on the role that skillsdevelopment policies can play in making
trade an engine of inclusive growth.
Speaking at the Social Forum of the UN
Human Rights Council on 2 October,
DG Azevêdo highlighted how the WTO’s
trade rules and its close cooperation with
the World Health Organization and the
World Intellectual Property Organization
have been essential in improving access
to medicines for developing countries
(see page 101).
The WTO was actively involved in
preparing for the G20 Agriculture
Ministers meeting and the Rapid
Response Forum of the G20 Agricultural
Market Information System (AMIS),
which took place in Berlin, in January
and February 2017, respectively. In
November, the meeting of the AMIS
Global Market Information Group
was hosted by the WTO. The WTO
undertook to continue helping AMIS
in ensuring increased transparency in
international commodity markets and
improving policy coordination as part
of the collective effort to address
global food security.

In Geneva, journalists attended a number
of WTO events, including seminars,
book launches, the Public Forum (the
organization’s flagship outreach event),
the Aid for Trade Global Review and the
Symposium on the 20th Anniversary of
the Information Technology Agreement
(see page 91). Press briefings (see
Figure 2) and press conferences
were held on a range of WTO issues,
including the WTO’s annual trade
forecast. In total, 46 press events took
place at WTO headquarters and the
nearby UN headquarters in Geneva.

The WTO received 226 requests for
registration to the media newsroom of
the WTO website, where journalists can
access press releases and publications
under embargo. The number of
journalists registered stood at 1,917
at the end of 2017.

Outreach
As MC11 was the first WTO Ministerial
Conference in South America, the
WTO invited 15 journalists from 13
Latin American countries to Geneva
in September for a seminar jointly
organized with the Friedrich Ebert
Foundation. The programme included
the new challenges of international
trade and preparations for MC11. The
journalists met the WTO ambassadors
from Argentina, Colombia and Panama
as well as DG Azevêdo.
A workshop for Latin American
journalists was organized in Buenos
Aires ahead of MC11. Nearly 30
journalists from 16 countries attended.
Argentine Minister of Foreign Affairs
Jorge Faurie and the Minister of
Production, Francisco Cabrera,
along with MC11 Chair Malcorra,
addressed the group.
WTO press officers also participated
in regional outreach programmes for
parliamentarians in Austria and Kuwait
in 2017 (see page 169).

•	 Two focus groups of business leaders, established
under the WTO’s Trade Dialogues initiative, issued
recommendations on business priorities for the WTO.

Background on contact
with the business
community
Business and the WTO have
always been closely connected.
The private sector is a major
beneficiary of transparent and
predictable trade rules and
obligations. Business is an
important interlocutor for both
governments and the WTO. It is
actively involved in the multilateral
trading system and participates in
public activities of the WTO.

The Trade Dialogues
initiative aims to
highlight how the
WTO can address
the challenges
facing business.

Trade Dialogues
Two focus groups of business leaders,
established at the first Trade Dialogues
meeting with the business community in
2016, made their final recommendations
on a range of trade-related issues, such
as services, investment, market access,
e-commerce and small and mediumsized enterprises (SMEs). The Trade
Dialogues initiative aims to highlight
the challenges and opportunities
businesses, both large and small, from
developed and developing economies,
face in conducting trade and how the
WTO can best address their needs.

MC11 Business Forum

The reports followed 11 months
of extensive online discussions. In
July 2017, the group leaders – John
Danilovich, Secretary General of the
InternationaI Chamber of Commerce
(ICC), and Dr Stormy Mildner, B20
sherpa and Head of Foreign Trade
Policy at the Federation of German
Industries – presented the
recommendations to the coordinators
of various groups of WTO members.

A Business Forum took place on
12 December in Buenos Aires, organized
by the Ministry of Production of
Argentina, together with the ICC, the
World Economic Forum and the B20.
It was the first time a business forum
had been held on the sidelines of a
WTO Ministerial Conference. The Forum
concluded with the ICC presenting
recommendations on the future direction
of the world trade agenda, which were
delivered to Director-General Azevêdo
and the Chair of the Conference,
Argentine Minister Susanna Malcorra.

The first set of recommendations
encourages WTO members to look into
ways of creating a global ecosystem
that better enables small businesses
to access international markets and

The recommendations focused on
three main elements: strengthening
the role of the WTO in response to
global challenges; establishing a new

recommendations also highlight the need
for enhanced connectivity and capacity

calls for the revitalization of WTO trade
negotiations and the rapid and effective
implementation of the Trade Facilitation
Agreement (see page 94). The two
discussion group leaders continued to
engage with WTO members in Geneva
on the basis of these reports.

priority issues for business; and
providing support to WTO members in
their discussions at the 11th Ministerial
Conference (MC11) and beyond.

Public Forum
At the end of the
Business Forum
in Buenos Aires,
the ICC presented
recommendations on
the future direction
of world trade.

The WTO’s 2017 Public Forum
(see page 166) drew 180 business
representatives to its debates and
meetings on the theme of “Trade:
behind the headlines”. The business
community organized 22 sessions during
the three-day event, covering topics
such as sustainability, inclusive trade,
e-commerce, protectionism, technology
and the future trade agenda.

Small Business Champions
ICC and the WTO launched the Small
Business Champions initiative in August
2017. The initiative provides a platform
for companies and private sector
organizations to propose innovative,
practical ideas to encourage micro,
small and medium-sized enterprises
(MSMEs) to do business across borders
(see page 176).

Global Trade Helpdesk
During MC11, the International Trade
Centre, the United Nations Conference
on Trade and Development and the
WTO launched an innovative tool to help
businesses, in particular smaller firms,
benefit from trade. Accessible through
a new online hub – HelpMeTrade.org
– the Global Trade Helpdesk will serve
as a one-stop shop for businesses and
policymakers seeking to access trade
data and to find practical information
on target markets.

Contact with the business community
www.wto.org/business
	

The Helpdesk provides data on tariffs
and taxes, relevant health and safety
standards and compliance procedures,
details about export and import
procedures, such as pre-shipment
formalities, and current trade patterns
and trade agreements. “For a small
business, easy access to the right
information can make the world of
difference,” DG Azevêdo said at
the launch.

E-commerce initiative
In Buenos Aires, the WTO, the World
Economic Forum and the Electronic
World Trade Platform (eWTP)
announced a joint initiative to drive
public-private dialogue on e-commerce.
“Enabling E-commerce” aims to
bring together leading voices from
governments, businesses and other
stakeholders for a high-level conversation
on e-commerce policies and practices
that can benefit small businesses. It will
also encourage research and knowledge
sharing on the practical challenges
faced by MSMEs and serve as a bridge
between global e-commerce practice
and policy.

Other contact
with businesses
Throughout the year, WTO officials
met with members of the business
community visiting Geneva and held
meetings with business representatives
during visits overseas. The issues most
frequently discussed included the state
of play in the WTO’s trade negotiations
ahead of MC11.

Champion s
i n it iat ive
Despite their economic importance in developed,
developing and least-developed countries, micro,
small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) have
a disproportionately small share of world trade.
Helping more MSMEs to trade internationally is an
important step to building a more inclusive trading
system that benefits a wider array of citizens. With
this in mind, the WTO and the International Chamber
of Commerce (ICC) launched the Small Business
Champions initiative in August.

The initiative called on companies and
private sector organizations around the
world to come up with innovative and
practical proposals for encouraging
and assisting MSMEs to do business
across borders.
Their proposals were also required to
indicate how ICC and the WTO could
contribute to the implementation of
the proposed project. Companies and
organizations putting forward successful
proposals would be recognized as
“ICC-WTO Small Business Champions”
following the conclusion of their project.

The initiative called
on companies to
submit proposals
aimed at helping small
businesses trade
across borders.

By the end of 2017, the initiative had
announced three successful proposals
– one submitted by Google, the second
by the Union of Chambers of Commerce
of the former Yugoslav Republic of
Macedonia and a third submitted jointly
by Mercado Libre, an e-commerce
company, and Argentina’s Chamber
of Commerce and Services.
Google’s proposal was for a video
competition, which invited MSMEs to
share their stories through a short video
about how they have used internet
technologies to participate in trade.
In September, Google launched the
competition entitled “Small Businesses
Going Global Video Challenge”.

World Trade Organization  Annual Report 2018

At a Business Forum in Buenos
Aires (see page 174), ICC and the
WTO announced the winners of the
competition and declared Google as
the first “Small Business Champion”.
“We were delighted by the level of
participation in the video competition.
We received so many compelling
stories of how internet technologies
are changing the trade landscape for
MSMEs,” said Director-General
Roberto Azevêdo.
The winning video was submitted
by Zedi, a small fashion business in
Ghana. The founder, Juliet Ajaab, told
how she harnessed new technologies,
such as the internet and social media,
to significantly increase the company’s
client base and to reach new markets
outside of Ghana.
The two runners-up were My Nametags,
a UK-based small business that
sells multi-purpose nametags, and
the Deering Banjo Co., based in the
United States, which produces musical
instruments. The prize for the winner
and runners-up is a trip to a master class
at Google in digital skills tailored
to MSMEs.

WTO and ICC
announced the
winner of the small
business video
competition in Buenos
Aires in December.

The proposal from the Union of
Chambers of Commerce of the Former
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia was
to create a digital platform for small
businesses that would help them
integrate into regional and international
markets and develop their capacity to
export. The “WORLD NET for Small
Businesses” would integrate 100 SMEs
from the Former Yugoslav Republic of
Macedonia into the network and assist
them in accessing relevant information
and understanding export procedures.

The proposal from Argentina’s Chamber
of Commerce and Services and
Mercado Libre is to develop a training
programme called the “Global SMEs
Launchpad”. It will allow 100 SMEs in
Argentina to benefit from tailored training
aimed at improving their business
skills so that they can showcase their
products on a dedicated online platform.
DG Azevêdo said: “This is an excellent
initiative, designed to provide SMEs with
the necessary skills to connect with
global markets.”
By the end of the year, the Champions
initiative had received a large number
of proposals from businesses and
business associations, with ideas for
capacity-building, awareness-raising,
online portals and digital platforms.
More successful proposals were
announced in early 2018.

4.7 per cent from India. Total page views
fell slightly from 52.9 million in 2016 to
50.1 million. Over 450 news items were
published in 2017.

Social media channels remain a key
means of providing regular updates
about WTO activities to journalists,
business people, academics and the
general public. The top performing
posts in 2017 included a video clip
with Nobel Laureate Paul Krugman
on the economics of global trade
and politics. Posts about the entry
into force of the Trade Facilitation
Agreement were also popular.

The most downloaded files were the

WTO publications

The WTO produces videos on a
variety of trade topics. In 2017, video
productions ranged from very short,
social media-friendly clips to hour-long
policy lectures to reach out to both the
specialist trade community and the
general public. One of the most popular
videos was “Trade changes”, released at
the Public Forum 2017, which illustrates
how trade changes, challenges and
connects people. WTO videos were
watched over 700,000 times on social
media over the year.

The publications programme was very
active, issuing 64 publications as well
as new apps of the Annual Report and
the World Trade Report. The WTO held
eight book launches, its highest number
in a single year. These included its first
co-publication with the United Nations
Food and Agriculture Organization,
“Trade and Food Standards” (see page
171), and “The WTO Agreements”, the
first update to the WTO’s legal rulebook
in over 20 years, which replaces
“The Legal Texts”.

Visiting groups

The publications most frequently
downloaded from the website were
the WTO’s three flagship publications
(see below). Most WTO publications
can be downloaded free of charge in the
WTO’s three official languages, English,
French and Spanish. Printed copies can
be purchased from a global network
of distributors and the WTO’s online
bookshop (http://onlinebookshop.wto.
org). The apps are available free
of charge from the App Store and
Google Play.

In 2017, the WTO welcomed 216 visiting
groups (approximately 6,270 people).
The presentations mostly covered
the WTO’s history, functions and
current work. Some groups requested
presentations on specific topics,
primarily dispute settlement, agriculture,
development and intellectual property
rights. Most of the presentations (148)
were given in English while 30 were
given in French, ten in Chinese, eight
in Russian, six in German and six in
Spanish. Three presentations each were
given in Ukrainian and Arabic, and two
in Japanese.

ILO - WTO

Some important benefits of trade, and of technology, materialize only if economies adjust –
often at a cost – to seize the opportunities offered by further integration or new technologies.
While neither the benefits nor the costs are shared equally within countries, the benefits from
trade or technological progress far outweigh the costs. This does not mean that the costs and
those who bear them can be ignored, however. Policies aimed at facilitating adjustment can
reduce the number of those left behind by trade or technology, while at the same time raising
the net gains from trade and technology, improving overall efficiency and boosting income.

INVESTING IN SKILLS FOR INCLUSIVE TRADE

20

In recent decades, the global economy has experienced a profound transformation due to
trade integration and technological progress as well as important political changes. This
transformation has been accompanied by significant positive effects at the global level,
as increased trade integration has helped to raise incomes in advanced and developing
economies, lifting millions out of poverty. At the same time, it has translated into change at the
levels of firms, individuals and communities. While overall, better job opportunities are on the
rise, some workers who are forced to leave their existing jobs find it difficult to access them.

The ITA commits its participants to
eliminating tariffs on a wide range of IT
products. To mark the Agreement’s 20th
anniversary, this publication analyses
its impact on its participants and on
worldwide trade in IT products.

Given the role of skills in productivity and in trade performance as well as in access to
employment and in wage distribution, a strong emphasis on skills development is vital for
both firms and workers. This publication argues that in the current fast-changing context of
globalization, where technology and trade relations evolve rapidly, the responsiveness of skills
supply to demand plays a central role not only from an efficiency but also from a distributional
perspective. Featuring results from the ILO’s Skills for Trade and Economic Diversification
(STED) Programme, this report shows that appropriate skills development policies are key to
helping firms participate in trade, and also to helping workers find good jobs.

Trade multilateralism in the 21st
century: Building the upper
floors of the trading system
through WTO accessions

The importance of the global value chain (GVC) phenomenon has
stimulated researchers to develop statistics and analysis based on
the value added in trade. The GVC phenomenon also demands that
researchers analyze the discrete tasks or phases in the production
process. Data are now available on the value added traded among major
economies during 1995–2014. This first Global Value Chain Development
Report draws on the expanding research that uses data on the value
added in trade. Its main objective is to reveal the changing nature of
international trade that can be seen only by analyzing it in terms of
value added and value chains.

•	 The WTO’s flagship World Trade Report examines the
links between technology, trade and jobs.
•	 Cutting trade costs is crucial to creating more inclusive
global value chains, a new report shows.
•	 Together with the OECD and the World Bank, the WTO
organized a conference for G20 policy makers to discuss
the distribution of gains from trade.

Background on economic
research activities
The WTO’s Economic Research
and Statistics Division organizes
regular seminars and conferences
as well as online forums involving
academics and researchers in
Geneva and around the world.
These activities include the
Geneva Trade and Development
Workshop programme. It is
responsible for the WTO’s
flagship publication, the World
Trade Report, which aims to
deepen understanding about
trends in trade, trade policy issues
and the multilateral trading system.

The WTO’s flagship publication, the
World Trade Report, was launched by
Director-General Roberto Azevêdo at
the WTO Public Forum (see page 166)
in September. The report notes that
continued economic progress hinges on
the ability of societies to remain open to
trade and technological advances, while
being able to adjust to changes in labour
markets, and how governments can
facilitate such adjustment.
The Global Value Chains Development
Report, "Measuring and Analysing
the Impact of GVCs on Economic
Development", was co-published in July
by the Institute of Developing Economies
(IDE-JETRO), the Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development
(OECD), the Research Center of
Global Value Chains of the University of
International Business and Economics
(UIBE), the World Bank and the WTO.
Global value chains (GVCs) have helped
developing countries make economic

progress but some have benefited more
than others. Cutting trade costs is crucial
to building more inclusive GVCs.
In 2017, the Geneva Trade and
Development Workshop hosted 23
events. It is co-organized by the WTO,
the Graduate Institute, the University
of Geneva and the United Nations
Conference on Trade and Development
(UNCTAD). The programme provides
a forum for the presentation of cuttingedge research and the exchange of
ideas, supports high-quality research
and facilitates outreach to policy-makers.
In June 2017, the Economic Research
and Statistics Division (ERSD) organized
with the OECD and the World Bank a
conference in Paris bringing together
policy-makers from G20 countries and
researchers to discuss the distribution
of the gains from trade. Together with
the IMF and the World Bank, the WTO

Engine of Growth for All" (see page
121), which was launched by the heads
of the three organizations at a meeting
with German Chancellor Angela Merkel
in Berlin.
The linkages between trade and
skills and between trade and skillsdevelopment policies are analysed in
a co-publication with the International
Labour Organization (ILO). Investing in
Skills for Inclusive Trade argues that a
strong emphasis on skills development
is vital for both firms and workers, given
the role of skills in productivity and trade
performance as well as in access to
employment and wage distribution.

Background on the
WTO Essay Award for
Young Economists
The WTO established the annual
WTO Essay Award for Young
Economists in 2009. The award,
which carries a prize of CHF
5,000, aims to promote high-quality
economic research on the WTO and
WTO-related issues and to reinforce
the relationship between the WTO
and the academic community.

Launched in 2016, the World Trade
Outlook Indicator (WTOI) continued to
provide “real time” information on trends
in global trade.

WTO Essay Award for Young Economists
The winner of the Ninth WTO Essay Award for Young Economists was
Meredith Startz of Princeton University for her paper on “The value of faceto-face: search and contracting problems in Nigerian trade”. The selection
panel also gave honourable mentions to Jingting Fan of the Pennsylvania
State University for his work “Talent, Geography, and Offshore R&D” and to
Zheli He of Columbia University for her paper, “Trade and Real Wages of
the Rich and Poor: Cross-Country Evidence”.
Meredith Startz's paper underlines the
importance of face-to-face transactions
for the importing of goods. The idea is
very simple: in contrast to purchasing
remotely, travelling to the point where
goods are imported entails a higher
fixed cost but allows importers to search
more effectively for the most up-todate products and to avoid contractenforcement issues by engaging in an
on-the-spot transaction. Using data from
Nigeria, the paper shows that removing
search and contracting problems is
important for the volume and gains
from trade and is likely to be especially
important for developing countries.
Jingting Fan’s paper looks at the issue
of research and development (R&D)
location as opposed to production
location. Zheli He makes a compelling
case for using the real wage rather than
nominal wage as the variable of analysis
of the effects of trade opening.
Meredith Startz is a Canadian and
US national. She received her PhD in
economics from Yale University in 2017.

Africa and the Middle East.
•	 Inter-agency task force on international trade statistics,
convened by WTO and OECD, held an expert meeting to

Background on
statistics activities
The Economic Research and
Statistics Division supports WTO
members and the WTO Secretariat
with data on economic and trade
policy issues and with technical
advisory services on market
access negotiations and on the
maintenance of goods schedules.
The division is the principal supplier
of WTO trade statistics and
information on tariffs and non-tariff
measures. It provides technical
assistance for trade policy courses
and national workshops and
contributes to inter-organizational
statistical activities.

Statistical time series
and publications
The WTO and the Organisation
for Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD) have developed
a transparent methodology to create
a global dataset of bilateral trade in
services statistics by main services
categories. This dataset is now
available for 1995-2012 and covers
191 countries and partners and 11
main services categories. The
accompanying methodology paper
can be downloaded from both the
OECD and WTO websites.
The approach leverages all available
official data and combines these with
estimates using derivations, back-casting
techniques, interpolation and predictions
derived from regression models. Exports
and imports are subsequently reconciled
by calculating a symmetry-index
weighted average between the two.
Another dataset, on trade in services by
mode of supply, funded by the European
Commission, is being developed in
cooperation with other international
organizations, data compilers and
researchers. Its release is planned for
end-2018.
In 2017, the WTO boosted its efforts to
improve dissemination of its statistical
products. In particular, a bulk download
online application was introduced to
allow users to download all annual data
on merchandise trade and trade in
commercial services.
The World Trade Statistical Review
2017, published in July, looks into the
latest developments in world trade,

	

184

World Trade Organization  Annual Report 2018

with a detailed analysis of the most
recent trends for trade in goods and
services. It also examines trade in
value-added terms and the latest
trade policy developments, highlighting
recent trends in WTO members’
use of trade-restrictive and tradefacilitating measures.
Two other statistical publications were
issued in July. Trade Profiles 2017
provides a series of key indicators on
trade in goods and services for 196
economies. World Tariff Profiles 2017,
a joint publication of the WTO, the
International Trade Centre (ITC) and the
United Nations Conference on Trade
and Development (UNCTAD), provides
comprehensive information on the tariffs
and non-tariff measures imposed by over
170 countries and customs territories.
The special topic in the 2017 edition was
“export diversification”, which analyses to
what extent economies have diversified
their exports.

Statistical capacity building
In 2017, the WTO worked closely
with UNCTAD, the OECD, ITC,
the United Nations Economic and
Social Commission for Western Asia
(UNESCWA), the United Nations
Statistical Division (UNSD) and the
Partnership in Statistics Development
in the 21st Century (PARIS21) to
improve statistics on trade in services, in
particular in Africa and the Middle East.
The WTO organized a course in Geneva
on trade in services statistics, with an
emphasis on Africa, to which experts
from the central banks of France and
Italy, UNCTAD, OECD, PARIS21 and
ITC contributed. A regional workshop

on trade in services statistics for Arab
countries, co-funded with the Arab
Monetary Fund, took place in the United
Arab Emirates and gathered experts
from the WTO, UNCTAD, UNESCWA
and UNSD.
Both activities focused on best practices
for collecting data in services sectors.
Prior to the course, selected participants
took a five-week e-learning course on
trade in services statistics developed
in partnership with UNCTAD.
In September, the WTO hosted the
first thematic course on trade in value
added (TiVA) and global value chains
(GVCs), with an emphasis on Africa.
The objective was to improve
participants’ understanding of the
policy implications of TiVA and the
repercussions of GVCs on trade.
In 2017, the WTO provided technical
assistance on trade in services and
GVC-related statistics in several
countries. A WTO Chairs Programme
(see page 186) workshop on GVCs and
trade in value added was organized
in Potchefstroom (South Africa),
focusing on presenting TiVA and
GVC concepts and indicators.

Expert meeting on
measuring digital trade
In April 2017, the G20 group of
developed and developing countries
called on the inter-agency Task Force

Statistics activities
www.wto.org/statistics

on International Trade Statistics (TFITS)
to engage more actively with national
statistical agencies and the business
community in developing proposals
for efficient reporting systems.
An expert meeting was organized
around a task force gathering in
Paris in October, bringing together
representatives from 18 developed and
developing countries and international
organizations. It discussed how best to
measure cross-border digitally related
transactions, or “digital trade”.

I-TIP
The WTO’s Integrated Trade Intelligence
Portal (I-TIP) was updated to increase
the information available on non-tariff
measures and on services trade policies.
As of the end of 2017, more than 51,000
measures had been included.

Preferential Trade
Arrangements database
The Preferential Trade Arrangements
(PTA) Transparency Mechanism
compiles information on non-reciprocal
preferential agreements, in particular
trade flows from non-reciprocal
preferential schemes. It covers more
than 30 schemes. The WTO Secretariat
initiated an update of the PTA database
(http://ptadb.wto.org) to provide
improved performance and additional
insights into utilization of preferential
market access (see page 86).

Background on WTO
Chairs Programme
The WTO Chairs Programme
was launched in 2010 to enhance
knowledge and understanding
of the trading system among
academics and policy makers in
developing countries. Chair-holders
are selected by a competitive
process. Its main objectives are to
foster further research on trade and
WTO issues, to provide teaching
support for the development and
delivery of courses on trade policy
and WTO-related matters and
to organize public activities to
disseminate research and promote
discussion regarding international
trade. The WCP is jointly managed
by the WTO’s Economic Research
and Statistics Division and
the Institute for Training and
Technical Cooperation.

Nineteen universities
from around the
world are members
of the WTO Chairs
Programme.

WTO Chairs Programme
The 2017 WCP Annual Conference,
held in Buenos Aires on 6-7 December,
prior to the WTO’s 11th Ministerial
Conference (MC11), reviewed work
of the programme, and identified best
practices, lessons learned and ways
to ensure sustainability. It concluded
with an address by the MC11 Chair,
Argentine Minister Susana Malcorra.
Chairs presented their research on a
number of trade-related topics — trade
and poverty, promoting connectivity and
trade behind the headlines, which was
the theme of the WTO Public Forum
(see page 166). The conference saw
the launch of a dedicated WCP website,
the WCP e-Platform, to facilitate
the sharing of information, encourage
discussion and promote internetbased networking among associated
institutions and individuals.
The Advisory Board, an external body
composed of experienced scholars,
recommended at its meeting in Buenos
Aires on 8 December that the WTO
Secretariat seek an extension of the
WCP to phase III after an evaluation of
the programme. This is scheduled to take
place after the second four-year phase
(phase II) concludes at the end of 2018.
The Board also made recommendations
on improving performance evaluation of
the WCP, enhancing work undertaken by

	

186

World Trade Organization  Annual Report 2018

its academic institutions and deepening
relations with the chairs from phases
I and II. Particular attention was given
to the role that Board members could
play in support of the chairs’ activities.
During the Sixth Global Review of Aid
for Trade (see page 154), chairs from the
University of Abomey-Calavi (Benin), the
University of the West Indies (Barbados),
the Getulio Vargas Foundation (Brazil)
and the University of Tunis (Tunisia)
delivered presentations on the review’s
theme – “Promoting Trade Inclusiveness
and Connectivity for Sustainable
Development”. The session, organized
by the Institute for Training and Technical
Cooperation (ITTC) and the WTO’s
Economic Research and Statistics
Division (ERSD), was attended by about
60 participants, including members of
the Advisory Board.
In September, chairs from the University
of the West Indies (Barbados),
Universitas Gadjah Mada (Indonesia),
the University of Jordan (Jordan) and the
North-West University (South Africa)
presented four case studies at the Public
Forum on how trade can be a catalyst
for growth and poverty alleviation.
They highlighted relevant analyses and
presented new perspectives. Specific
emphasis was placed on the need
for trade policy to be inclusive and
how to mainstream trade into national
development strategies.

Activities of WTO chairs
The research output of the Phase II
chairs was substantial in 2017 – some
11 publications in peer-reviewed journals,
five books or book chapters and more
than 30 working papers on trade,
WTO topics and subjects of importance
to the WTO.
The programme helped 18 students
develop PhD or Master’s theses on
WTO-related issues and trained
about 2,600 students. Forty-four
new or updated courses and diploma
programmes were proposed and
two new fully-fledged diplomas were
developed. The chairs arranged
48 outreach activities, attracting
approximately 1,200 participants,
among them more than 200 officials
or policy-makers.
Chairs were active in several
conferences in addition to the Public
Forum and the Aid for Trade Global
Review, where they reached out
to national government agencies,
international organizations,
the business community, media
and other academics to underline
the importance of trade. The WTO
Secretariat participated in and
supported 16 technical assistance
activities organized by chairs, such as
academic conferences, seminars and
specialized courses.

Academic Support
Programme
In 2017, 12 activities were implemented
under the Academic Support
Programme (ASP), which engages with
academic institutions from developing
countries and least-developed countries
(LDCs) that are not part of the WCP.
Activities over the year included lecturing
arrangements with universities in which
WTO staff taught in masters and
bachelor degree courses.
Special efforts were made to support
university competitions on WTO law.
The WTO provided staff to act as
panellists in regional inter-university
competitions and for the final round
at WTO headquarters (see page 139).
The ASP also handled donations
of WTO publications to universities
and organized presentations to
academic audiences. The WTO
continued encouraging universities
to register lecturers as participants
in online courses offered by the
WTO’s E-campus.

I have always been attracted by the idea of
working for a public institution, as I believe
that even the slightest contributions can
have a positive impact on society as a whole.
Therefore, for me, joining the WTO was an

communications, statistics, finance,
human resources and language services.
The working languages of the WTO are
English, French and Spanish.
Secretariat staff on the regular budget
comprise professional and support
service categories. Professional staff
account for 62 per cent of the total
and support service staff 38 per cent.
Women continue to outnumber men
at the WTO, by 333 to 292. Of the
professional staff, 44 per cent are female
and 56 per cent male.
The Human Resources Division
continues to respond to the evolving
needs of the Secretariat by reallocating
resources to high-priority areas.
Staffing measures take into account the
limitations imposed by WTO members,
including the overall cap on the budget
and personnel, and are being met
through internal redeployment of posts.
Due to the increase in dispute settlement
activity, 29 posts have been redeployed
to the legal divisions, with the remaining
recruitment expected to be finalized in

opportunity to help the organization fulfil
its important mission as a forum for solving
global problems.
Prior to my arrival, I worked for seven years as
a systems engineer in the Central Bank of the
Republic of Turkey, where I was responsible
for the infrastructure of the country’s financial
operations. As an IT professional, I love taking
part in projects that transform the way people
work and I am looking forward to contributing in
a similar way in my new role at the WTO. I also
find it a rewarding and fulfilling experience to
work in the WTO’s multinational environment.

2018. At the end of 2017, the number
of staff working in the legal divisions
stood at 25 in the Appellate Body, 33 in
the Legal Affairs Division and 27 in the
Rules Division, up from 17, 23 and 20,
respectively, in 2014, when the period of
reallocation began.
New methods of informal resolution
of workplace disputes continue to be
available in the organization, as initiated
in 2016. The expected appointment
of a Staff Welfare Officer in 2018 will
be another avenue for staff to seek
assistance in addition to the External
and Internal Mediator, Head of Office
of Internal Oversight (OIO) and Legal
Counsel to the Administration. The OIO
took over functions formerly exercised
by the Office of Internal Audit.
The Young Professionals Programme
(YPP), introduced in 2016, is aimed at

increasing the number of professionals
in the WTO Secretariat from developing
and least-developed countries which are
not currently represented. As a result
of the successful outcome of the YPP
in 2017, when five young professionals
joined the WTO in various divisions, the
number of recruits has tripled to 15 in
January 2018.
A new Medical Service, with a newly
appointed doctor, replaced the previous
Occupational Health Service. This new
service provides a more comprehensive
health approach, including regular
medical appointments, depending on
age and risk factors, new treatments,
including homeopathic preparations,
as well as offering further guidance to
staff with their health concerns. The
new doctor has launched a “Wellness
Challenge”, a new initiative promoting
health and fitness among staff.

Development Division
Nationality: Seychellois
Joining date: 4 January 2017
I became interested in development issues
during my undergraduate studies, and in trade
when I went to work at the Seychelles Trade
Department. I developed a better appreciation
of the multilateral system after attending a WTO
regional trade policy course in 2006 and after
undertaking a WTO-sponsored internship with
the African, Caribbean and Pacific Group of
States (ACP) Mission in Geneva in 2008.

World Trade Organization  Annual Report 2018

When I worked for the Government of
Seychelles, I was directly involved in trade,
investment and development policy formulation.
I worked on WTO accessions and free trade
agreement negotiations, and worked with
a number of international organizations on
structural adjustment programmes and
on private sector and small business
development initiatives.
Being part of the WTO allows me to further
enhance my expertise on issues related to trade
and development and provides me with exciting
opportunities to interact with experts directly
involved with these issues.

•	 The Committee reviewed reports on the WTO’s financial
and budgetary situation, proposed that the General
Council approve the 2018-19 budget.
•	 The Office of Internal Oversight presented its report
on internal audit activities.

Background on
budget, finance and
administration
The Committee on Budget, Finance
and Administration monitors the
WTO’s budgetary and financial
matters. It considers issues concerning
human resources management,
hears progress reports on the WTO
pension plan and deals with financial
and administrative matters concerning
the WTO Secretariat. The Committee
reports to the General Council.

In 2017, the WTO Secretariat presented
the 2016 WTO financial performance
report. The Committee on Budget,
Finance and Administration proposed
and the General Council approved the
transfers between budgetary sections
outlined in the report. The external
auditors presented their report for 2016
to the Committee. On the basis of a
recommendation from the Committee,
the General Council approved the
auditors’ report.

WTO pension plan; a report on
the WTO medical plan and after
service health insurance (ASHI)
contributions; the actuarial position of
the WTO pension plan; the WTO risk
management report; the annual report
on diversity in the WTO Secretariat;
the human resources annual report
on grading structure and promotions;
the 2016-17 report on staff learning
development; and the report of the
Office of Internal Oversight.

The WTO Secretariat regularly updates
WTO members on aspects of the
organizational review process launched
by Director-General Roberto Azevêdo in
December 2013. In 2017, they included
the bonus working group, various
groups assessing issues related to staff
performance, the promotion policy and
the staff mobility initiative.

The Committee reviewed the status of
outstanding contributions from members
and urged, through the General
Council, members under administrative
measures to liquidate their arrears. On
the recommendation of the Committee,
the General Council suspended the
application of administrative measures
for the Republic of Guinea-Bissau,
which agreed to liquidate all its arrears
over a period of 30 years.

The Committee examined and proposed
to the General Council to approve the
2018-19 biennium budget proposals for
the WTO and the International Trade
Centre. Also, the Committee proposed
that the General Council approve the
WTO members’ scale of contributions
for 2018.
The Committee held several
meetings and submitted ten reports
to the General Council in 2017. The
Committee reviewed and took note of:
the quarterly reports on the financial
and extra-budgetary situation of the
Organization; regular updates on the
arrears of contributions from members
and observers; a progress report on the

The Office of Internal Oversight (OIO)
presented its report on internal audit
activities. The OIO is responsible for
conducting internal audits, investigations
and any other assessment deemed
necessary to strengthen accountability,
internal controls, compliance, value
for money and governance in the
WTO Secretariat.
The Committee was informed about
the launch of the new e-registration
application, which was used for WTO
members’ accreditation for the 11th
Ministerial Conference.

The management board of the WTO
pension plan shared with the Committee
proposed revised rules for the WTO
pension plan. The Committee took note
of the proposed revisions and sent them
to the General Council for approval.
In February 2017, the Committee
agreed to establish a working group to
further monitor the development of an
ASHI strategy reserve fund proposal.
The working group submitted its report
in October. The Committee approved
the establishment of a special ASHI
reserve account.

recommended to the General Council
the norms for their approval, including
the amounts for 2018. The General
Council approved the recommendations
of the Committee.

The Committee deliberated extensively
on dependency allowances and

The WTO derives its income from annual
contributions from its 164 members
(see Table 2) and miscellaneous income.
These contributions are based on a
formula that takes into account each
member’s share of international trade.
Miscellaneous income mainly consists
of contributions from observer countries,
income from the sale of publications and
rental of meeting rooms.

WTO Secretariat

How t he WTO
i s s t r uc t u red
The WTO’s top-level decision-making body is the Ministerial
Conference, which usually meets every two years.

Below this is the General Council
(normally ambassadors and heads of
delegation in Geneva, and sometimes
officials sent from members’ capitals),
which meets several times a year in the
Geneva headquarters. The General
Council also meets as the Trade
Policy Review Body and the Dispute
Settlement Body.
At the next level, the Goods Council,
Services Council and Intellectual
Property (TRIPS) Council report to
the General Council.

Numerous specialized committees,
working groups and working parties
deal with the individual agreements and
other areas such as the environment,
development, membership applications
and regional trade agreements.
All WTO members may participate in
all councils and committees, with the
exceptions of the Appellate Body,
Dispute Settlement panels and
plurilateral committees.

0 is zero or became zero due to rounding.
Billion means one thousand million.
Minor discrepancies between constituent figures and totals are due to rounding.
Unless otherwise indicated, (i) all value figures are expressed in US dollars; (ii) trade figures include the intra-trade of free trade areas, customs unions, regional and other
country groupings.
Note This report covers the WTO’s activities in 2017 and early 2018. The word “country” is frequently used to describe WTO members whereas a few members are
officially “customs territories”, and not necessarily countries in the usual sense of the word.

Annual
Report 2017

A year in review
A large number of WTO members ratified the Trade Facilitation
Agreement in 2016, paving the way for its entry into force
in early 2017. Many members also accepted an amendment
to the WTO’s intellectual property agreement, which finally
came into effect in the first quarter of 2017. The amendment
secures for developing countries a legal pathway to access
affordable medicines. WTO members engaged constructively
across several areas of trade negotiations from mid-2016 as
they began to work towards the WTO’s forthcoming ministerial
conference, to be held in Argentina in December 2017.
