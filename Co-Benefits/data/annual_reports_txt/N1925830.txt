Introduction
1.
Mindful of its primary responsibility for the
maintenance of international peace and security, the
Security Council continued to engage on a widereaching agenda in accordance with the principles and
objectives set forth in the Charter of the United Nations.
During the period from 1 January to 31 December 2018,
the Council held 288 formal meetings, of which 275
were public. The Council adopted 54 resolutions and 21
presidential statements and issued 87 statements to the
press. During the reporting period, the Council
conducted three missions.
2.
In 2018, the Council continued to focus on a
number of serious unresolved conflicts, in particular in
the Middle East and Africa. The impact of these
conflicts on civilians was severe. Large-scale
humanitarian crises persisted and in some cases
worsened, and large flows of displaced people within
and across borders continued as a result of conflict.
Divisions in the Council prevented it from taking
effective action on some key conflicts.
3.
However, there were also several positive
developments in 2018. In Africa, countries of the Horn
of Africa were able to make progress in resolving long standing bilateral disputes, the United Nations Mission
in Liberia concluded its work and a peace agreement
was signed in South Sudan. In Asia, the level of tension
on the Korean Peninsula reduced as a result of dialogue
between the parties. In the Middle East, Islamic State in
Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, also known as Da’esh) was
driven out of Iraq and lost control of most of the territory
that it held in the Syrian Arab Republic. Progress was
made in the peace process in Colombia, and elections in
countries including Afghanistan, the Democratic
Republic of the Congo, Iraq and Lebanon made
important contributions to political stability.
4.
The Council remained convinced of the vital role
that the United Nations and the multilateral system
should play in preventing and resolving conflicts on its
agenda, as set out by all Council members during an
open debate on the subject in November. The Council
took advantage of a wide range of tools to that end,
including mediation, the deployment of peacekeeping
and special political missions and the use of targeted
sanctions and arms embargoes.
5.
Some Council members consistently underlined
the importance of taking action at every stage in the
conflict cycle and focusing on sustaining peace. Council
members also stressed the need to respect international
law and to maintain the international non-proliferation
regime. Throughout 2018, Council members continued
8/227

to focus on the implementation of the Council’s
thematic resolutions in the context of the conflicts on its
agenda, including the need to consider the role of
women in preventing and resolving conflict.
6.
At the end of 2018, almost 90,000 peacekeepers
were deployed in 14 missions in support of Council
mandates. A total of 98 peacekeepers were killed in
2018. Council members note with appreciation the
contribution of United Nations peacekeepers to
supporting international peace and security and pay
tribute to the 98 peacekeepers who sacrificed their lives
in 2018.
7.
Further information on the work of the Council
and more detailed accounts of its meetings can be found
in the monthly assessments of the Council’s work,
available online at www.un.org/securitycouncil/content/
monthly-assessments. Records of all open Council
meetings, including the names and titles of officials
providing briefings, are available at www.un.org/
securitycouncil/content/meetings. This introduction does
not seek to provide an exhaustive list of meetings,
developments or Council responses. It is intended as a
succinct and useful overview of key developments.
Unless otherwise indicated, resolutions referred to in
this introduction were adopted unanimously.

Africa
8.
The Council continued to monitor the situation in
Burundi closely. The constitutional referendum in May
was a particularly significant political development. In
April, in a presidential statement (S/PRST/2018/7), the
Council expressed its concern about the political
situation in Burundi and reiterated its ongoing support
for the efforts of the African Union and East African
Community to bring about a peaceful resolution of the
political situation in the country through an inclusive
dialogue.
9.
The Council reaffirmed its support for the United
Nations Regional Office for Central Africa in 2018. In
August, in a presidential statement (S/PRST/2018/17),
it noted the recommendation of the Secretary-General to
extend the mandate of the Office for three years. The
extension of the mandate was subsequently confirmed
in an exchange of letters between the Secretary-General
and the President of the Security Council (S/2018/789
and S/2018/790). The Council also expressed its support
for the work of the United Nations Office for West Africa
and the Sahel in presidential statements in January
(S/PRST/2018/3) and August (S/PRST/2018/16). In

Introduction

December, the Executive Director of the United Nations
Office on Drugs and Crime briefed the Council on the
security implications of drug trafficking in West and
Central Africa.
10. The conflict in the Central African Republic
continued to be a major focus of the Council’s work.
The Council repeatedly expressed its concern about the
level of violence in the country, including through nine
statements to the press, and maintained consistent
support for the African Initiative for Peace and
Reconciliation. In January, the Council adopted
resolution 2399 (2018), by which it extended the arms
embargo and targeted sanctions until 31 January 2019.
In December, it adopted resolution 2448 (2018) by 13
votes in favour, with 2 abstentions. By that resolution,
the Council extended the mandate of the United Nations
Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in
the Central African Republic until 15 November 2019.
11. The situation in the Democratic Republic of the
Congo and its implications for security in the Great
Lakes region remained a source of concern for the
Council. In particular, the Council followed closely the
implementation of the political agreement of
31 December 2016, including the preparations for the
presidential elections, which were held at the end of
December 2018. Election preparations formed the focus
of the Council’s visit to the country from 5 to 7 October.
During the visit, Council members met the President,
Joseph Kabila Kabange, representatives of the
Independent National Electoral Commission, members
of the Government, representatives of political parties
and civil society and the leadership of the United
Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the
Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUSCO).
12. The Council also monitored the humanitarian
situation closely, including an outbreak of Ebola. This
led to the unanimous adoption in October of resolution
2439 (2018), in which the Council encouraged close
cooperation between the Democratic Republic of the
Congo, the World Health Organization and other Ebola
responders to address the challenge, and called upon all
parties to the conflict to ensure full, safe, immediate and
unhindered access for humanitarian and medical
personnel.
13. In March, the Council adopted resolution 2409
(2018), by which it extended the mandate of
MONUSCO until 31 March 2019. MONUSCO
remained the largest peacekeeping mission mandated by
the Council. In the resolution, the Council also urged the
Government to cooperate fully with the United Nations
team deployed to assist the investigations by the
Congolese authorities into the deaths of two United

19-14156

Nations experts in March 2017, and to ensure that all
perpetrators were brought to justice and held
accountable. In June, the Council adopted resolution
2424 (2018), by which it extended the mandate of the
Group of Experts until 1 August 2019.
14. Some of the most encouraging moments of 2018
took place in the Horn of Africa. On 9 July, Eritrea and
Ethiopia signed a Joint Declaration of Peace and
Friendship. Subsequently, the President of Eritrea and
the Prime Minister of Ethiopia signed the Agreement on
Peace, Friendship and Comprehensive Cooperation on
16 September in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. In addition, the
Presidents of Djibouti and Eritrea held a meeting in
September. The Council welcomed these developments
in statements to the press in July and September. The
signing of the Agreement between Eritrea and Ethiopia
made possible the Council’s decision to lift its sanctions
on Eritrea by its resolution 2444 (2018) in November.
15. The Council followed the political, humanitarian
and security situation in Somalia closely. It noted in
particular the importance of security sector, economic
and political reforms and called for 2018 to be “a year
of implementation” in a statement to the press in
January. The importance of the relationship between the
Federal Government of Somalia and the federal member
states was a consistent theme of Council discussions
throughout the year. In June, the Council adopted a
presidential statement (S/PRST/2018/13), in which it
welcomed the peaceful election of a new Speaker of the
House of the People and the resumption of the Federal
Parliament’s activity.
16. The security situation remained a source of deep
concern for the Council. In the same presidential
statement, the Council expressed its concern about
fighting in the Sool region and the ongoing threat posed
by Al-Shabaab. In November, the Council condemned
the terrorist attack in Mogadishu of 9 November in a
statement to the press.
17. The Council remained committed to supporting a
conditions-based transition of security responsibilities
from the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM)
to Somali security institutions, as endorsed by the Peace
and Security Council of the African Union in April and
by international partners at the Somalia Security HighLevel Meeting, held in Brussels in May. In July, the
Council adopted resolution 2431 (2018), in which it
decided to reduce the authorized number of uniformed
AMISOM personnel to a maximum of 20,626 by
28 February 2019 and expressed its intention to follow
closely the implementation of the transition plan and the
handover of security responsibilities with the aim of

Report of the Security Council to the General Assembly for 2018

Somali security institutions taking the lead by December
2021.
18. In March, the Council adopted resolution 2408
(2018), by which it renewed the mandate of the United
Nations Assistance Mission in Somalia. In November,
the Council extended its authorization for international
naval forces fighting piracy off the Somali coast by its
resolution 2442 (2018). Also in November, the Council
adopted resolution 2444 (2018), by which it renewed the
sanctions and arms embargo on Somalia and the ban on
the import and export of Somali charcoal.
19. In February, the Council adopted resolution 2404
(2018), by which it extended the mandate of the United
Nations Integrated Peacebuilding Office in GuineaBissau (UNIOGBIS) until 28 February 2019. Under the
new mandate, the Council requested UNIOGBIS to
focus on support for the implementation of the Conakry
Agreement on the Implementation of the Economic
Community of West African States Road Map for the
Resolution of the Political Crisis in Guinea-Bissau and
an inclusive political dialogue; the electoral process;
and the review of the Constitution of Guinea-Bissau. In
the same resolution, the Council also set out its support
for the efforts of the Economic Community of West
African States to resolve the crisis and underlined the
importance of holding legislative and presidential
elections on time.
20. The year 2018 saw the closure of the United
Nations Mission in Liberia (UNMIL), which completed
its mandate on 31 March. In a presidential statement
(S/PRST/2018/8),
the
Council
expressed
its
appreciation for the contribution made by UNMIL,
commended the commitment of the Government and
people of Liberia to respect and develop democratic
processes and institutions, and recognized the important
role of the Peacebuilding Commission in Liberia and
encouraged its continued active engagement. In
addition, the Council asked the Secretary-General to
prepare a report on the contribution of UNMIL to
resolving conflict in Liberia.
21. In Libya, the Council continued to support the
efforts of the Special Representative of the SecretaryGeneral to find a political solution to the ongoing
instability and violence in the country within the
framework of the Libyan Political Agreement endorse d
by resolution 2259 (2015). In June, in a presidential
statement (S/PRST/2018/11), the Council set out its
support for election preparations and the national
conference process. In the same statement, the Council
also welcomed the momentum generated by the
international conference on Libya hosted in Paris by the
President of France, Emmanuel Macron, on 29 May. On

10/227

5 September, in a statement to the press, the Council
condemned violence in Tripoli and called upon all
parties to exercise restraint and engage seriously in
national reconciliation.
22. In September, by its resolution 2434 (2018), the
Council extended the mandate of the United Nations
Support Mission in Libya until 15 September 2019. In
November, by its resolution 2441 (2018), the Council
renewed the sanctions regime and arms embargo and
extended the mandate of the Panel of Experts until
15 February 2020. The resolution was adopted by 13
votes in favour, with 2 abstentions. In June, by its
resolution 2420 (2018), the Council renewed the
authorization to inspect vessels suspected of violating
the arms embargo. In October, the Council adopted
resolution 2437 (2018), by which it renewed its
authorizations related to the smuggling and trafficking
of persons, as set out in paragraphs 7 to 10 of resolution
2240 (2015). At the end of the year, the attack against
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Tripoli underlined the
seriousness of the terrorist threat in Libya. The Council
responded by condemning the attack in a statement to
the press in December.
23. The Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court
briefed the Council in relation to the situation in Libya
in May and November.
24. The Council continued to follow political and
security developments in Mali with concern. The
progress of the peace process, in particular the
implementation of the Agreement on Peace and
Reconciliation in Mali, was a major focus of the Council
in 2018. In June, by its resolution 2423 (2018), the
Council called upon the Government of Mali and the
United Nations to sign a pact for peace. In October, the
Council welcomed the signing of the pact in a statement
to the press but stressed the urgent need for all parties to
step up the implementation of the Agreement.
25. On several occasions, the Council expressed its
concern about security developments in Mali, in
particular the deterioration of the situation in central
Mali. In October, in a statement to the press, the Council
called for the implementation of the Government’s plan
to re-establish State presence in central Mali and
emphasized the importance of close cooperation
between the United Nations Multidimensional
Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA)
and the Malian armed forces in this area.
26. In June, by its resolution 2423 (2018), the Council
renewed the mandate of MINUSMA until 30 June 2019.
In 2018, MINUSMA suffered more casualties than any
other peacekeeping mission. The Council condemned
attacks against the Mission in five statements to the

Introduction

press. In August, the Council renewed the sanctions
regime and the mandate of the Panel of Experts by its
resolution 2432 (2018).
27. There was broad Council agreement that the
situation in Mali could not be dealt with in isolation and
that a comprehensive approach to security challenges
and instability in the Sahel was needed. In that context,
the Council issued statements to the press in May and
November, in which it welcomed the continued
commitment of the States of the Group of Five for the
Sahel (Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali, Mauritania and the
Niger) to uniting their efforts to address the impact of
terrorism and transnational organized crime in the Sahel
region. The Council welcomed the operationalization of
a robust compliance framework to prevent, investigate,
address and publicly report violations and abuses of
human rights law and violations of international
humanitarian law related to the Joint Force of the Group
of Five for the Sahel.
28. The Council monitored the progress towards the
full operationalization of the Joint Force and in this
context underlined the importance of international
support for the Force. Key steps included the holding of
the high-level conference on the Sahel in February,
which resulted in pledges to the Force totalling 414
million euros, and the signing of a technical agreement
between the United Nations, the European Union and
the States of the Group of Five for the Sahel to provide
support through MINUSMA in accordance with the
conditions set out in resolution 2391 (2017). The
Council reaffirmed the centrality of the United Nations
integrated strategy for the Sahel in providing a
comprehensive framework to strengthen governance,
security and development in the Sahel region. It
welcomed the launch of the United Nations support plan
for the Sahel on the margins of the African Union
summit held in Nouakchott in June 2018.
29. In July, the Deputy Secretary-General briefed the
Council on her joint visit to the Sahel with the Special
Envoy of the Chairperson of the African Union on
Women, Peace and Security and the Minister for Foreign
Affairs of Sweden, with a focus on women and peace
and security, and the adverse effects of climate change.
30. The importance of close cooperation with the
African Union was a key theme of many Council
discussions on Africa in 2018. In July, the Special
Representative of the Secretary-General to the African
Union and Head of the United Nations Office to the
African Union introduced the report of the SecretaryGeneral on strengthening the partnership between the
United Nations and the African Union (S/2018/678),
noting that the African Union was the most important

19-14156

strategic partner of the United Nations. Also in July, the
members of the Council and the Peace and Security
Council of the African Union met in New York and
issued a communiqué. Although the meeting was
focused on the situations in South Sudan and the
Democratic Republic of the Congo, there was also an
opportunity for an informal exchange of views on the
institutional reforms under way at the United Nations
and the African Union and their significance for
enhancing the partnership between the two
organizations.
31. There were improvements to the security situation
in Darfur and no significant clashes between
government forces and the armed opposition. However,
the Council continued to express its concerns about
clashes in the Jebel Marra region.
32. The focus of Council discussions on Darfur in
2018 was progress towards the drawdown of the African
Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur
(UNAMID). Following a special report from the
Secretary-General and the Chairperson of the African
Union Commission, the Council adopted resolution
2429 (2018) in July. In the resolution, the Council
extended the mandate of UNAMID until 30 June 2019
and took note of the recommendation in the special
report for a transition over a two-year time frame with a
view to the exit of the Mission on 30 June 2020 and its
liquidation by December 2020, provided that there is no
significant change in the security situation and key
indicators are met.
33. In December, in a presidential statement
(S/PRST/2018/19), the Council took note of the report
of the Secretary-General on UNAMID (S/2018/912), in
which a benchmarked exit strategy for UNAMID was
set out. In February, by its resolution 2400 (2018), the
Council extended the mandate of the Panel of Experts
on the Sudan. The Council also expressed its intention
to review the measures on Darfur.
34. The Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court
briefed the Council in relation to the situation in Darfur
in June and December.
35. The Council continued to focus on the situation in
South Sudan. The Council remained concerned by
continuing armed clashes across the country and
repeated violations of the Agreement on Cessation of
Hostilities, Protection of Civilians and Humanitarian
Access of 21 December 2017. The Council maintained
strong support for the efforts of the African Union and
the Intergovernmental Authority on Development to
address the crisis.

Report of the Security Council to the General Assembly for 2018

36. In May, the Council adopted resolution 2418
(2018) by nine votes in favour, with six abstentions. In
the resolution, the Council renewed the sanctions
measures imposed in resolution 2206 (2015) and the
mandate of the Panel of Experts. In July, the Council
adopted resolution 2428 (2018) by nine votes in favour,
with six abstentions. In the resolution, the Council
established an arms embargo and imposed a travel ban
and asset freeze on two individuals.
37. In August and September, two key developments
took place in the peace process within the framework of
the Intergovernmental Authority on Development
revitalization forum for peace in South Sudan. On
5 August, the President of South Sudan, Salva Kiir, and
the opposition leader, Riek Machar, signed an
agreement on outstanding issues in governance and the
sharing of responsibilities (S/2018/574, annex). On 12
September, President Kiir and Riek Machar signed the
Revitalized Agreement on the Resolution of the Conflict
in South Sudan. The Council remained focused on the
implementation of these agreements during the rest of
the year and, in December, issued a statement to the
press in which it condemned abuses against the
Ceasefire and Transitional Security Arrangements
Monitoring and Verification Mechanism team.
38. On 10 August, the permanent missions of Côte
d’Ivoire, Kuwait, the Netherlands and Sweden to the
United Nations called for consultations on food security
in South Sudan, in line with the provisions of resolution
2417 (2018) on conflict and hunger. The UnderSecretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and
Emergency Relief Coordinator briefed the Council. The
Council also remained concerned by the extent of sexual
violence in South Sudan and issued a statement to the
press on the issue in December.
39. By its resolution 2406 (2018), the Council
extended the mandate of the United Nations Mission in
South Sudan (UNMISS) until 15 March 2019. Council
members remained concerned by threats against
UNMISS and, in a statement to the press, condemned an
attack against the Mission on 26 June that killed one
peacekeeper.
40. The Council continued to support the United
Nations Interim Security Force for Abyei. The focus of
Council discussions on the subject in 2018 was the
nature of the mandate and the size of the Force. In April,
by its resolution 2412 (2018), the Council extended the
elements of the mandate dealing with support to the
Joint Border Verification and Monitoring Mechanism
until 15 October 2018. In May, by its resolution 2416
(2018), the Council extended the mandate of UNISFA

12/227

until 15 November and reduced the troop ceiling to
4,500.
41. In October, by its resolution 2438 (2018), the
Council welcomed the progress made in implementing
the Joint Border Verification and Monitoring
Mechanism but noted that the measures set out in
resolution 2412 (2018) had not been completely
achieved. The Council extended the relevant elements
of the mandate until 15 April 2019. In November, by its
resolution 2445 (2018), the Council extended the
UNISFA mandate until 15 May 2019, reduced the troop
ceiling to 4,140 and agreed to increase the authorized
number of police to 345.
42. The major development with regard to Western
Sahara in 2018 was the holding of a round-table meeting
of Morocco, the Frente Popular para la Liberación de
Saguía el-Hamra y de Río de Oro (Frente POLISARIO),
Algeria and Mauritania in Geneva in December. The
Personal Envoy of the Secretary-General for Western
Sahara, Horst Köhler, convened these talks as part of a
renewed political process.
43. In April and October, the Council adopted
resolutions 2414 (2018) and 2440 (2018). Both
resolutions were adopted by 12 votes in favour, with 3
abstentions. In the resolutions, the Council extended the
mandate of the United Nations Mission for the
Referendum in Western Sahara by a period of six
months. In resolution 2440 (2018), the Council also
reaffirmed the objective of a just, lasting and mutually
acceptable political solution that would provide for the
self-determination of the people of Western Sahara and
welcomed the decisions of Morocco, the Frente
POLISARIO, Algeria and Mauritania to accept the
Personal Envoy’s invitation to a round-table meeting.

Americas
44. In 2018, the Council maintained its full support for
the peace process in Colombia. In several statements to
the press, the Council welcomed the commitment shown
by the parties in 2018, including the new Government
led by President Iván Duque Márquez, which came into
power in August. It stressed on several occasions the
importance of the full political, legal and socioeconomic
reincorporation of former members of the Revolutionary
Armed Forces of Colombia-People’s Army (FARC-EP)
members. The Council also expressed concern about
insecurity in some of the conflict-affected areas of the
country, including the persistent pattern of
assassinations of community and social leaders.
45. One setback to the peace process was the
resumption of attacks by the National Liberation Army
19-14156

Introduction

(ELN), which the Council said that it regretted in a
statement to the press issued in January. In the same
statement, the Council expressed its hope that ELN and
the Government of Colombia would resume work to
reach an agreement on renewing and strengthening the
ceasefire. In April, in another statement to the press, the
Council welcomed the resumption of dialogue between
the parties and encouraged the conclusion of a new
ceasefire.
46. The Council continued to support the United
Nations Verification Mission in Colombia and, in
September, adopted resolution 2435 (2018), by which it
extended the mandate of the Mission until 25 September
2019.
47. In Haiti, the Council focused its attention on the
future of the United Nations presence in the country. In
April, the Council adopted resolution 2410 (2018) by
13 votes in favour, with 2 abstentions. By that
resolution, the Council extended the mandate of the
United Nations Mission for Justice Support in Haiti
(MINUJUSTH) until 15 April 2019. It also decided that
MINUJUSTH would maintain seven formed police units
and 295 individual police officers until 15 October
2018, and that the number of formed police units would
be reduced to five by 15 April 2019. The Council
affirmed its intention to consider the Mission’s
withdrawal and transition to a non-peacekeeping United
Nations presence in Haiti, beginning no sooner than
15 October 2019.
48. In July, in a statement to the press, the Council
condemned the rise in violence in Haiti and called upon
all parties to remain calm, exercise restraint and avoid
acts that could contribute to instability.
49. In September, the Council discussed the situation
in Nicaragua under the agenda item “Cooperation
between the United Nations and regional and
subregional organizations in maintaining international
peace and security”.

Asia
50. Ongoing violence in Afghanistan remained a
source of great concern for the Council. During the year,
the Council issued 14 statements to the press in which it
condemned terrorist attacks in the country.
51. The Council continued to support the peace
process in Afghanistan. In March, in a statement to the
press, the Council welcomed the convening of the
second meeting of the Kabul Process for Peace and
Security Cooperation in Afghanistan on 28 February and
commended the declaration agreed upon by its
19-14156

participants. Members of the Council welcomed the
offer made by the Government of Afghanistan to the
Taliban to engage in direct peace talks and called upon
the Taliban to accept the offer without any
preconditions.
52. In June, the Government of Afghanistan
announced a temporary ceasefire with the Taliban for
the end of Ramadan and the Eid al-Fitr holiday. In
response, the Taliban announced a partial ceasefire. In a
statement to the press, the Council welcomed these
announcements and urged the Taliban to reciprocate the

preventive diplomacy and expressed its support for the
Centre’s role in regional counter-terrorism and counternarcotics activities and its engagement on border and
transboundary water management. In January, in a
presidential statement (S/PRST/2018/2), the Council
underlined the importance of making conflict
prevention and resolution central to the work of the
United Nations system in Afghanistan and the Central
Asian States, and welcomed further cooperation and
coordination between the Centre, the Central Asian
States and relevant regional organizations, including
those organizations of which the Central Asian States
are members, to strengthen the region’s capacity to
overcome challenges to peace, stability and sustainable
development.
58. The situation in Myanmar remained a source of
concern for members of the Council. In response, the
Council conducted a visit to Bangladesh and Myanmar
from 28 April to 2 May. The terms of reference for the
mission (S/2018/391, annex) focused on the
implementation of the presidential statement of
November

letter dated 14 December (S/2018/1111).
61. The Council continued to support progress
towards a settlement in Cyprus following the break-up
of the talks in Crans-Montana, Switzerland, in July
2017. The Special Representative of the SecretaryGeneral in Cyprus and Head of Mission, United Nations
Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP), briefed the
Council on prospects for a settlement on several
occasions. In its resolutions 2398 (2018) and 2430
(2018), the Council reiterated its support for an
enduring, comprehensive and just settlement based on a
bicommunal, bizonal federation with political equality,
and urged the sides and all parties involved to renew
their political will and commitment to a settlement
under the auspices of the United Nations.
62. In its resolution 2398 (2018), the Council
requested the Secretary-General to submit a report on
progress towards a settlement by 15 July 2018. In the
report (S/2018/610), the Secretary-General noted that,
10 months after the closing of the Conference on Cyprus
in Crans-Montana, there had been no further progress
towards a settlement. The Secretary-General expressed
his view that there was still scope for the sides to chart
a common way forward and, in this regard, expressed
his intention to send a senior United Nations official to
the island to conduct in-depth consultations with the
parties.
63. Following the publication of the report of the
Secretary-General, the Council, in its resolution 2430
(2018), welcomed the appointment of a United Nations
senior official, Jane Holl Lute, and urged the sides and
all parties involved to seize the important opportunity

Introduction

64. The other focus of the Council’s discussions on
Cyprus in 2018 was the mandate of UNFICYP. In
January, by its resolution 2398 (2018), the Council
extended the mandate of UNFICYP for a period of six
months. It also welcomed the report of the SecretaryGeneral on the strategic review of UNFICYP
(S/2017/1008) and endorsed its recommendations. In
July, by its resolution 2430 (2018), the Council
subsequently extended the mandate until 31 January
2019.
65. The Council met on four occasions to discuss the
letter dated 13 March 2018 from the Chargé d’affaires
a.i. of the Permanent Mission of the United Kingdom of
Great Britain and Northern Ireland to the United Nations
addressed to the President of the Council (S/2018/218).
The annex to the letter was a letter from the Prime
Minister of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and
Northern Ireland to the Secretary-General regarding the
poisoning of Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia
Skripal in Salisbury on 4 March. On 6 September, the
Permanent Representative of the United Kingdom of
Great Britain and Northern Ireland to the United Nations

of the Council (S/2014/136) and the letter dated 13 April
2014 from the Permanent Representative of the Russian
Federation to the United Nations addressed to the
President of the Council (S/2014/264). Following a
meeting on 6 June in connection with the first of those
two letters, the Council, in a presidential statement
(S/PRST/2018/12), expressed grave concern with regard
to the recent deterioration of the security situation in
eastern Ukraine and its severe impact on the civilian
population. It condemned continuous violations of the
ceasefire regime and called for the implementation of
the disengagement commitments and the immediate
withdrawal of heavy weapons in accordance with the
Minsk agreements. It underlined the need for strict
compliance with resolution 2202 (2015) and encouraged
all the parties to recommit to the peace process and to
implement all the measures agreed in the Normandy
format and the Trilateral Contact Group. It also

and called upon all parties to facilitate the work of the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe
Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine.

Affairs briefed the Council on the situation in Georgia
under the agenda item “Other matters” on 8 August.

in 2018. Council members agreed on the interconnected
nature of the conflicts in the region, and the SecretaryGeneral delivered a briefing on that subject in June.
69. The Council held eight meetings to discuss the
situation in Iraq. A key focus was the need to support
Iraq in addressing the challenges it faced following its
victory over ISIL, in particular post-conflict
reconstruction and reconciliation. In June, by its
resolution 2421 (2018), the Council extended the
mandate of the United Nations Assistance Mission in
Iraq (UNAMI) until 31 May 2019. The Council decided
that the Special Representative of the Secretary-General
for Iraq and UNAMI should prioritize the provision of
advice, support and assistance to the Government and
people of Iraq with regard to advancing inclusive,
political dialogue and national and community-level
reconciliation. The Council also welcomed the
independent external assessment of UNAMI as
requested by resolution 2367 (2017) and encouraged
UNAMI, the Secretariat and United Nations agencies,
offices, funds and programmes to implement those
recommendations.
70. The Council maintained its commitment to the
stability, security, sovereignty and political independence
of Lebanon throughout the year. In that context, in a
statement to the press in March, the Council welcomed
the convening of a ministerial meeting in Rome in
support of the Lebanese Armed Forces and the Internal
Security Forces. The Council noted the important role
played by these forces in protecting the borders and
population of Lebanon and saluted the role of the
Lebanese Armed Forces in defeating the territorial
ambitions of Da’esh, the Nusrah Front and other United
Nations-designated terrorist groups in Lebanon.
71. A key event of 2018 in Lebanon was the holding
of legislative elections in May, which the Council
welcomed in its resolution 2433 (2018). These were the
first parliamentary elections in Lebanon since 2009.
72. The Council continued to monitor closely the
situation on the border between Israel and Lebanon. In
its resolution 2433 (2018), the Council expressed its
concern at the limited progress made towards the
establishment of a permanent ceasefire and other key
provisions of resolution 1701 (2006). The Council also
expressed deep concern at continuing violations in

connection with resolution 1701 (2006) and requested
the Secretary-General to report on those violations in
detail every four months and to include in the reports an
annex on the implementation of the arms embargo.
Among the concerning developments of 2018 was the
discovery by Israel of several tunnels dug under the Blue
Line separating Israel and Lebanon. The Council met on
two occasions in December to discuss that issue.

Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the Council met on
14 April at the request of the Russian Federation under
the agenda item “Threats to international peace and
security”. The Secretary-General gave a briefing. At the
end of the meeting, draft resolution S/2018/355 4 was not
adopted owing to the failure to secure nine votes in
favour (three votes in favour and eight against, with four
abstentions).

73. In August, by its resolution 2433 (2018), the
Council reiterated its support for the United Nations
Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) and extended the
Force’s mandate until 31 August 2019. On 9 August
2018, in a statement to the press, the Council
condemned the attack against UNIFIL on 4 August, in
which peacekeepers were threatened with illegal
weapons, vehicles were set on fire and UNIFIL weapons
and equipment were seized. The members of the Council
underlined the need for a credible investigation to
determine the exact circumstances of the attack.

77. With regard to the humanitarian situation, the
Council adopted resolution 2401 (2018) in February. In
the resolution, the Council demanded that all parties
cease hostilities without delay and engage immediately
to ensure the full and comprehensive implementation of
that demand by all parties, for a durable humanitarian
pause for at least 30 consecutive days throughout the
country. At the same time, the Council affirmed that the
cessation of hostilities did not apply to military
operations against ISIL and all other individuals,
groups, undertakings and entities associated with
Al-Qaida or ISIL, and other United Nations-designated
terrorist groups. Following the adoption of the
resolution, the Council met on several occasions to
discuss concerns regarding its implementation.

74. The situation in the Syrian Arab Republic
remained one of the most contentious issues on the
Council’s agenda. The Council met on 65 occasions to
discuss the conflict in the country. Its meetings focused
on chemical weapons, the humanitarian situation and
political developments.
75. With regard to the issue of chemical weapons, one
of the most significant moments of 2018 followed
reports of the use of chemical weapons in the town of
Duma in April. Council members proposed three
resolutions that would have established mechanisms to
investigate these reports. Draft resolution S/2018/321 1
was not adopted owing to the negative vote of one
permanent member of the Council (12 votes in favour
and 2 against, with 1 abstention). Draft resolution
S/2018/175 2 was not adopted owing to the failure to
secure nine votes in favour (six votes in favour and
seven against, with two abstentions). Draft resolution
S/2018/322 3 was not adopted owing to the failure to
secure nine votes in favour (five votes in favour and four

2258 (2015), 2332 (2016), 2393 (2017) and 2401
(2018). The Council recalled the need to create
conditions throughout the country and facilitate the safe,
voluntary and dignified return of refugees and internally
displaced persons to their home areas in the Syrian Arab
Republic. At the same time, it emphasized that the
humanitarian situation would continue to deteriorate in
the absence of a political solution. It also renewed for a
further year its authorization for United Nations
humanitarian agencies and their implementing partners
to use routes across conflict lines and the border
crossings of Bab al-Salam, Bab al-Hawa, Ya‘rubiyah
and Ramtha, in addition to those already in use, as set
out in paragraph 2 of resolution 2165 (2014).
79. On 19 March, several Council members requested
a briefing by the United Nations High Commissioner for
Human Rights on the situation in the Syrian Arab
Republic. Following an objection to the adoption of the
agenda, a procedural vote was held. The agenda item

Introduction

80. In its resolution 2449 (2018), the Council
reiterated its call upon the parties to the conflict to make
progress towards a political solution to the conflict in
line with resolution 2254 (2015) and reiterated its
support for the Action Group for Syria Final
Communiqué of 30 June 2012 (resolution 2118 (2013),
annex II).
81. The Council met frequently to discuss the situation
in the Middle East, including the Palestinian question,
in line with paragraph 7 of its resolution 1322 (2000)
and paragraph 12 of its resolution 2334 (2016). The
United Nations Special Coordinator for the Middle East
Peace Process and Personal Representative of the
Secretary-General to the Palestine Liberation
Organization and the Palestinian Authority briefed the
Council on 17 occasions. His briefings focused in
particular on the following matters: the absence of a
political process; the deteriorating humanitarian and
economic situation in Gaza and the escalations of
violence in and around the Gaza Strip; the continued
settlement activity of Israel, including in areas deep into
the West Bank; the demolition and seizure of
Palestinian-owned structures; and the funding gap faced
during much of the year by the United Nations Relief
and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near
East. In June, the Secretary-General issued his first
written report on the implementation of resolution 2334
(2016) (S/2018/614).
82. A key concern of the Council in 2018 was the
situation in Gaza and the Great March of Return
demonstrations, which saw increased levels of violence
leading to civilian casualties. On 1 June, the Council
considered two draft resolutions in response to
increased levels of violence. Draft resolution
S/2018/516 5 was not adopted owing to the negative vote
of one permanent member (10 votes in favour and 1
against, with 4 abstentions). Draft resolution
S/2018/520 6 was not adopted owing to the failure to
secure nine votes in favour (1 vote in favour and 3
against, with 11 abstentions).
83. The Council maintained its support for the United
Nations Disengagement Observer Force in 2018. In
June, by its resolution 2426 (2018), the Council
extended the mandate of the Force for a period of six
months. In December, by its resolution 2450 (2018), the
Council extended the mandate for a further six months.
In both resolutions, the Council expressed grave
concern regarding violations of the Agreement on
Disengagement between Israeli and Syrian Forces of
1974. The Council continued to call for the immediate

84. The Council continued to follow the conflict in
Yemen closely. The Council remained deeply concerned
by the high levels of violence in the country and the
continued deterioration of the humanitarian situation. In
March, the Council adopted a presidential statement
(S/PRST/2018/5), in which it expressed its grave
concern at the continued deterioration of the
humanitarian situation and its distress at the level of
violence in Yemen. At the same time, it emphasized that
the humanitarian situation would continue to deteriorate
in the absence of an inclusive political solution. Also in
March, in a statement to the press, the Council
condemned the multiple Houthi missile attacks,
including the use of ballistic missiles, targeting several
cities in Saudi Arabia.
85. On 5 September, in a statement to the press, the
Council reiterated its support for the political process
led by the United Nations in Yemen and the efforts of
the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for Yemen
to bring about a political settlement. It also expressed its
support for the consultations between the parties that
were due to take place in Geneva the following day.
86. Although the parties did not convene for
consultations in Geneva in September, they were able to
meet in Stockholm from 6 to 13 December. The meeting
in Stockholm concluded with the signing of the
Stockholm Agreement (S/2018/1134, annex). This
included an agreement on the city of Hudaydah and the
ports of Hudaydah, Salif and Ra’s Isa, an executive
mechanism on activating the prisoner exchange
agreement and a statement of understanding on Ta‘izz.
87. In December, in its resolution 2451 (2018), the
Council welcomed the consultations in Stockholm,
endorsed the Stockholm Agreement and called for its
implementation. In particular, the Council insisted on
the full respect by all parties of the ceasefire agreed for
Hudaydah Governorate and the mutual redeployment of
forces. The Council authorized the establishment and
deployment of an advance team to begin monitoring and
to support and facilitate the immediate implementation
of the Agreement. It also requested the SecretaryGeneral to submit proposals before the end of 2018 on
how the United Nations would fully support the
Agreement.
88. In the light of the humanitarian situation, in
resolution 2451 (2018), the Council also called upon the
Government of Yemen and the Houthis to remove
bureaucratic impediments to flows of commercial and
humanitarian supplies and upon the parties to ensure the
effective and sustained functioning of all ports of
Yemen, onward road access throughout the country and
the reopening and safe and secure operation of Sana’a

decided to extend the mandate of the Panel of Experts to
support the work of the Security Council Committee
established pursuant to resolution 2140 (2014).

Thematic issues
90. There were a number of significant developments
in the Council’s consideration of thematic issues in
2018. Several Council members continued to show
significant interest in ensuring that the Council
considered thematic issues, such as women and peace
and security, children and armed conflict, and protection
of civilians, as part of its geographical work, but the
Council also considered them in a cross-cutting format.
91. On 18 January, the Council adopted a presidential
statement (S/PRST/2018/1), in which it focused on
conflict prevention and preventive diplomacy,
underlining the need for a comprehensive conflict
prevention strategy and expressing its support for the
Secretary-General’s efforts in this regard. In August, in
an open debate, the Council highlighted the importance
of mediation in conflict prevention and resolution.
92. The Council remained committed to peacebuilding
and sustaining peace. In April, the Secretary-General
briefed the Council on his approach to these issues. The
following day, by its resolution 2413 (2018), the
Council welcomed the presentation of the report of the
Secretary-General on peacebuilding and sustaining
peace
(A/72/707-S/2018/43),
took
note
with
appreciation of the recommendations and options set out
in the report and decided to discuss them further.
93. The Council continued to cooperate closely with
the Peacebuilding Commission. In December, in a
presidential statement (S/PRST/2018/20), the Council
underlined the importance of strong coordination,
coherence and cooperation with the Commission and
encouraged the Commission to present concise, targeted,
context-specific and applicable recommendations to the
Council, in particular ahead of relevant mandate
discussions.
94. The importance of protecting children in armed
conflict was reiterated by the Council in its resolution
2427 (2018), adopted in July. In the resolution, the

18/227

Council condemned in strong terms serious abuses and
violations against children in armed conflict and
underlined its commitment to considering and using a
comprehensive set of tools to strengthen international
cooperation on their effective protection.
95. In June, in its resolution 2419 (2018), the Council
focused on the important and positive contribution that
young people could make to efforts for the maintenance
and promotion of peace and security and encouraged
relevant entities of the United Nations to consider how
they integrate the needs of young people into their
consideration of conflicts. This followed an open debate
on youth, peace and security in April.
96. Women and peace and security remained a priority
for many members of the Council. In April, in an open
debate, the Council focused on sexual violence in
conflict. In October, the Secretary-General briefed the
Council on promoting the implementation of the women
and peace and security agenda through the economic
and political empowerment of women.
97. In May, the Secretary-General briefed the Council
on the protection of civilians in armed conflict following
the publication of his annual report on the issue
(S/2018/462). Two days later, the Council adopted
resolution 2417 (2018), in which it focused on the link
between armed conflict and violence and conflictinduced food insecurity and the threat of famine. That
issue had also been the subject of a briefing in March by
the Executive Director of the World Food Programme
and the Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian
Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator. In resolution
2417 (2018), the Council requested the SecretaryGeneral to report swiftly to it when the risk of conflict induced famine and widespread food insecurity occurs
in the context of armed conflict. In September, in a
presidential statement (S/PRST/2018/18), the Council
reiterated its commitment to the protection of civilians
and recognized the contribution of the updated aidememoire to the consideration of issues pertaining to the
protection of civilians in armed conflict, including its
enhanced focus on the protection of medical facilities
and personnel and on the use of starvation as a method
of warfare.
98. The Council continued to emphasize the
importance of upholding international law within the
context of the maintenance of international peace and
security and held an open debate on that subject on
17 May.

the threat posed by ISIL, Al-Qaida and associated
individuals, groups, undertakings and entities, the
Council
adopted
a
presidential
statement
(S/PRST/2018/21) in December. In the statement, the
Council noted that it had conducted a review of the
measures described in paragraph 1 of resolution 2368

resolution and confirmed that no further adjustments to
the measures were necessary at that time. In December,
the Council also received its first briefing on the work
of the United Nations Investigative Team to Promote
Accountability
for
Crimes
Committed

Da’esh/Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant, which was
established pursuant to resolution 2379 (2017).

several notable cross-cutting thematic developments.
Many of the developments were connected to the
Secretary-General’s Action for Peacekeeping initiative
on which the Secretary-General briefed the Council
during an open debate in March. In May, in a

Other matters

working methods, including through the implementation
of the note by the President of the Council (S/2017/507).
In January, the Council held an open debate on that
issue.
114. On 30 August, the Council adopted its annual
report (S/2018/797).
115. Throughout the year, the Council continued to
receive regular briefings from the Chairs of its
subsidiary bodies, including the regular briefing by the
outgoing Chairs in December.
116. Lastly, Members of the Council were shocked and
saddened by the passing away of the Permanent

Tanoh-Boutchoué, in April and would like to take this
opportunity to pass their condolences to the Mission of

revised draft rules of procedure, contained in document S/115 of 1 August 1946,
during the period under review. The Committee held a total of 27 meetings and
discussed a total of 37 topics (60 agenda items). During the reporting period, the
Committee conducted two field missions to current United Nations peacekeeping
operations.
4.
Military representatives of elected members of the Security Council participated
in all 27 meetings. Representatives of Secretariat departments participated in
discussions: the Department of Peacekeeping Operations on 24 topics, the
Department of Political Affairs on 8 topics and the Department of Field Support on
one topic.
5.
Current United Nations peacekeeping and special political missions were the
focus of 27 meetings and 30 topics (see appendix IV. A).
6.

Nine meetings included various thematic debates (see appendix IV. A).

7.
The Committee conducted two missions to areas of current United Nations
peacekeeping operations. Members of the Committee also visited the Peacekeeping
Training Centre in China from 10 to 13 April 2018.
8.
During the first mission, the Committee visited Pakistan from 13 to 16 April
2018. The primary purpose of the visit was to gain an in-depth understanding of the
United Nations Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan (UNMOGIP) and its
capabilities. Key recommendations from the visit were as follows:
(a) Conduct a military capability study of UNMOGIP with the aims of
obtaining a troop-to-task analysis, evaluating the requirement to secure the Group ’s
freedom of movement in India-administered Kashmir and identifying and evaluating
the actions of the United Nations Secretariat upon receipt of confirmed investigations
of cross-border violations;
(b) Conduct a review of the Secretariat’s efforts and responsiveness to
UNMOGIP, with an immediate focus on the Secretariat’s actions upon receipt of
UNMOGIP cross-border investigations and the timely approval of UNMOGIP
standard operating procedures;

Report of the Security Council to the General Assembly for 2018

(c) Further review host nation in-kind contributions and their effect on
UNMOGIP. Unfair or unnecessary expenditure of UNMOGIP resources results in
fewer resources being available to the Group to fulfil the responsibilities under its
mandate;
(d) The Secretariat should provide relevant documents, such as the concept of
operations and standard operating procedures of UNMOGIP, to the Committee.
It is worth noting that the Department of Peacekeeping Operations subsequently
refused to provide the concept of operations as requested above.
9.
During the second mission, the Committee visited Mali from 12 to 15 November
2018. The primary objectives of the mission were to gain an in-depth understanding
of the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali
(MINUSMA) and to assess the Mission’s military challenges and opportunities in
executing mandates, the appropriate allocation of resources and infrastru cture, plans
for the future of the Mission and conditions that might prompt a change in force
structure. During the trip, Committee members were accompanied by military
representatives of elected members of the Security Council (from Côte d ’Ivoire, the
Netherlands and Sweden). Key recommendations from the visit were as follows:
(a) The Committee assesses that MINUSMA has the resources necessary to
deliver the mandate, but that they are not coordinated and synchronized effectively,
precluding full delivery against the mission mandate. The Mission seems to have
reached its limit in its current configuration and needs to adapt to fulfil the mandate
in its entirety;
(b) The Mission is trying to develop a comprehensive, overarching missionwide strategy detailed in a mission concept. It would be helpful to reflect therein the
presence of all actors, such as the Malian Defence and Security Forces, the European
Union Training Mission in Mali, the Joint Force of the Group of Five for the Sahel
and Operation Barkhane, in order to create a coherent strategy for the wider region.
It would be beneficial if more coherence between the uniformed and civilian pillars
could be achieved, especially in the central part of Mali, including through political
dialogue. Malian State authorities need to increase their presence, but they need the
support of MINUSMA to do so;
(c) Within the mission concept, emphasis should be put on the concept of
operations of the police component, ensuring that its efforts are coherent with the
mission mandate, as well as an evaluation of the current footprint in relation to the
mandate. The formed police units should be tasked with supporting the civilian
component by ensuring its security when there is a need to deploy and engage with
the local population. Capacity-building, mentoring and support for the whole rule of
law sector are crucial;
(d) Information-gathering capabilities and analysis should be improved in
order to achieve a better situational understanding, using the draft peacekeeping
intelligence handbook as a reference. There is a need for a more comprehensive
approach to information-sharing between all MINUSMA actors, as well as with other
United Nations organizations, the host nation and other entities. There also seems to
be a discrepancy between analysis conducted at the force level and that of United
Nations Headquarters in New York;
(e) The Committee concurs with the Force Commander that MINUSMA
should be transformed into a more agile and flexible force. While force protection
remains fundamental to the force, there are various tools that may make it possible to
reconcile the competing requirements of protection and mobility through such means
as training, the implementation of more secure operating procedures and tactics or
innovative technologies;

Report of the Military Staff Committee

(f) The use of air assets, both civilian and military, is crucial for the Mission.
As with other missions with a high level of casualties, the authority to launch medical
and casualty evacuations should be delegated to the Force Comma nder. Special
Representatives of the Secretary-General should also consider further delegating
authority for the use of military air assets to Force Commanders in o ther appropriate
situations.
10. The Committee continued to announce all meetings and provis ional agendas in
the Journal of the United Nations and on its website ( www.un.org/sc/suborg/en/
subsidiary/msc), which is available in the six official languages of the United Nations
and offers swift and easy access to the programme of work and current information
on the Committee.
11. In accordance with paragraph 178 of General Assembly resolution 60/1 entitled
“2005 World Summit Outcome”, the Committee continued to consider its
composition, mandate and working methods.
12. As part of efforts to enhance the efficiency and transparency of the Committee ’s
work, as well as interaction and dialogue with the Secretariat and the military
representatives of the non-permanent members of the Security Council, the members
of the Committee, at its 1921st meeting, adopted a note by the Chair of the Committee
and endorsed the handbook of working methods of the Military Staff Committee,
annexed thereto.
13. According to available records, the 1918th meeting of the Committee, held on
5 October 2018, was the first meeting chaired by a woman, Senior Colonel Min Feng
(China).
14. Military representatives of Equatorial Guinea and Kuwait have not yet been
appointed.
15. The Committee remained prepared to carry out the functions assigned to it under
the terms of Article 47 of the Charter.
