MESSAGE FROM THE
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR

“In 2016, UNICEF and our
partners focused relentlessly
on results – helping
deliver proven, lifesaving
interventions to the children
and families who need them
the most.”

Every year is important to UNICEF
and to our core mission: working to
achieve results for every child.
Whoever she is. Wherever he lives.
Whatever the circumstances. No
matter the obstacles.
But 2016 was important in some
exceptional ways.
It was the year in which we marked
UNICEF’s 70th anniversary, looking
back to celebrate and reflect on
what we have learned – and looking
ahead to apply those lessons to
meet the challenges we face to
reach every child.
In 2016, with approximately 535 million
children living in countries affected by
conflict, natural disasters, epidemics
and other emergencies worldwide …
with nearly 50 million children on the
move, more than half of them forcibly
displaced … and with around 385
million children living in extreme poverty and millions more experiencing
discrimination and exclusion, those
challenges are as great as any we
have faced in our 70-year history.

OPPOSITE PAGE: UNICEF Executive
Director Anthony Lake stands with
supporters of the Refugee Olympic
Team that competed at the 2016
Summer Olympic Games in Rio de
Janeiro, Brazil.

2016 was also the first full year of
working to make progress towards
the Sustainable Development Goals.
Agenda 2030 sets ambitious targets
to eliminate extreme poverty and
hunger, provide quality education
for all, protect the planet and promote peaceful, inclusive societies
– and to do so in a way that leaves
no one behind.

UNICEF | ANNUAL REPORT 2016

By definition, this means we must
reach the most disadvantaged,
vulnerable and excluded children
– every boy and every girl, in every
society. In fact, there is no other
way. Investing in reaching the
farthest behind children will not only
save lives – it will save futures. For
by providing today’s children with
the services and support they need
to make the most of their own lives,
we give them the tools to help their
own children fulfil their potential –
breaking intergenerational cycles
of poverty and deprivation, and
building a more equal world.
In 2016, UNICEF and our partners
focused relentlessly on delivering
the results that save children’s
lives and futures – helping deliver
proven, life-saving interventions to
the children and families who need
them the most … using our purchasing power to reduce the price
of vaccines … reaching children in
emergencies with critical support
and learning materials to keep them
from falling behind … advocating
for the rights of children who are
excluded because of their ethnicity,
or their gender, or a disability.
As the pages of this report show,
that meant immunizing more than
85 million children against measles
and treating another 4.5 million for
severe acute malnutrition. It meant
helping provide access to safe
water for nearly 29 million children
and family members caught in
conflicts and natural disasters. It

-----------------------Page 4 End-----------------------

meant helping millions of migrant
and refugee children with access
to education and psychosocial
support.
It also meant working with
governments to strengthen health
and other vital systems … working
with partners in civil society and the
private sector to develop innovations
that can make it easier to reach the
hardest-to-reach children and families
… working with communities to
identify problems and solutions to the
barriers they face in accessing critical
services … and working with children
and young people to meet their needs
and make their voices heard.

By helping change the lives of these
children – and so many others – for
the better, we are showing that
progress is possible. That every life
has an immeasurable value. And that,
ultimately, the better, more equal
world envisioned by the Sustainable
Development Goals is not a naive
hope, but a reachable reality.

Anthony Lake

This report tells the stories of
some of those children. Stories
like that of Abdul, a seven-year-old
Syrian boy who was able to attend
school for the first time at a refugee camp in Jordan. Or Ganga,
age 20 and nine months pregnant,
who found comfort and prenatal
care at a shelter in Nepal after

losing her home to an earthquake.
Or Joel, a premature baby from
a poor family in Uruguay who
received the nutritional support
and health care he so desperately
needed to survive. Or Savy, age
13, who got the attention and
counselling she needed to begin
reclaiming her life at a centre for
trafficked children in Cambodia.

INTRODUCTION

70 YEARS AND COUNTING

Seven decades ago, the world was
recovering from a devastating world
war. For millions of child survivors
of that war, peace still encompassed a landscape of significant
challenges and damaged futures.
UNICEF was created to help those
children – no matter who they were,
no matter where they were from.
The only thing that mattered for the
nascent organization was achieving
results for children in need.

@UNICEF:
ADVOCACY IN 2016
#FightUnfair.
UNICEF launches The State
of the World’s Children 2016
in June. The flagship report
makes the case for UNICEF’s
efforts to improve health and
education for every child,
regardless of background. In
connection with the report,
UNICEF Georgia releases a
video on the stigma street
children face. The video
surpasses 140 million views
on UNICEF Facebook pages
in less than a week.

Today, UNICEF’s network, which
spans the globe, offers innovative
solutions and tested expertise,
and is still getting results for the
world’s children – regardless
of their background. The only
thing that matters is helping the
furthest from help, reaching the
most left behind and including the
most excluded.

Scaling up results in 2016
UNICEF has made an important
impact over the years – particularly
when measured by the gains of the
past three decades – in areas such
as child survival, primary education
enrolment and access to safe water.
In 2016, UNICEF scaled up its
global results.

UNICEF | ANNUAL REPORT 2016

It was one of the most dangerous
years to be a child in recent memory.
Conflicts and crises around the world
threatened and displaced millions.
Millions more faced poverty, deprivation, violence, exploitation and
discrimination. For its part, UNICEF
responded to 344 humanitarian
emergencies in 108 countries.
In all these emergencies, UNICEF
played a lead role in coordinating the
response by United Nations agencies, international non-governmental
organizations and local partners
to provide safe water and sanitation, nutrition and education. The
organization’s worldwide supply
chain dispatched help accurately
and speedily.
Just as important, in the aftermath
of those crises, UNICEF remained
on the ground to deliver. Through
cross-sectoral protection, education, social inclusion and health
interventions, UNICEF enhanced
childhoods even as it helped save
lives. Recognizing that disaster
recovery lays the foundation for
long-term development, UNICEF
helped communities prepare for
future crises and climate shocks,
thus easing the path for children
to fulfil their potential.

CHILDREN AND YOUTH IN FOCUS
No Fear of Snow: Shelter for two young refugees in Serbia

In 2016, the migrant and refugee
crisis in Europe surpassed even the
crisis that prompted the founding
of UNICEF just after the Second
World War. Throughout the winter
of 2016, UNICEF worked to support
refugees and both governmental
and non-governmental partners
providing shelter and relief.
In November, as temperatures
dropped, Naedel, age 4, was
already cold. “I don’t have a jacket
or boots. I don’t have a winter
hat on my head,” she whimpered
as her sister, Zorah, age 15,
rummaged through a bag under
the bed, searching for something
warm to put on.
Naedel, Zorah and their two
other siblings were staying in
a reception centre in Sjenica,
south-west Serbia. They were fed
and housed along with 200 other
refugees, but they lacked warm

Introduction: 70 years and counting

clothes. Their only shoes were
summer clogs.
Then UNICEF arrived. Thanks
to donations from the European
Commission’s Humanitarian Aid
and Civil Protection Department
and the Government of Japan,
UNICEF was able to distribute
shoes and clothing. There was
already a line when Naedel and
Zorah arrived, and they watched
in disbelief as children came
away with new boots and sets
of winter clothes.
Just moments before,
they were looking for ways to
spend the evening wrapped
in something other than dusty
blankets. Now they were the
owners of warm blue boots,
colourful jackets and winter pants.
Forgetting her earlier concerns,
the girls talked excitedly about
the coming snow.

UNICEF Executive
Director Anthony Lake
calls Universal Children’s
Day “an annual opportunity
to recommit ourselves to
protecting the rights of
every child.” Lake cites
“the uncomfortable truth”
that the rights of millions
of children are violated
daily by violence, abuse
and exploitation. By protecting
their rights, he adds, we
protect “our common future.”

#ENDviolence

A powerful short film featuring
UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador
David Beckham premieres
in December, illustrating the
brutal reality that physical and
psychological abuse can mark
children forever. The film’s
perspective is crafted from
thousands of responses to
a poll on violence conducted via
U-Report, UNICEF’s innovative
text-messaging tool to amplify
the voices of children and
young people.

Innovation
and partnerships
UNICEF continued to use
cost-effective strategies to ensure
that every possible dollar went
towards services for children. As
one of the world’s largest buyers of
vaccines, insecticide-treated mosquito nets and nutritional therapies,
UNICEF’s leverage helped bring
down the costs of saving lives.
In support of these savings, UNICEF
innovation teams and partnerships
unveiled new technologies and products designed to reach the hardest-toreach children and communities.
For example, the Magic Box
Initiative – a partnership with Google,
IBM and Telefonica – collects and
analyses real-time data to improve

emergency responses. The UNICEF
RapidPro mobile platform continues
to help reduce maternal and childhood mortality, including in rural
areas of Zambia, where HIV-positive
mothers can now find out the status
of their child in half the time it used
to take. UNICEF’s Internet of Good
Things is bridging the digital divide
in more than 40 countries, reaching
more than a million people a month
with offline education and life-saving
information. Also in 2016, UNICEF
piloted a humanitarian drone to
accelerate HIV test result delivery in
Malawi and a mobile phone birth registry in Pakistan.
A dedicated Innovation Fund is
financing promising early-stage
projects like these, and UNICEF’s
Global Innovation Centre is expanding the most effective initiatives.

@UNICEF:
ADVOCACY IN 2016

As an organization entirely reliant on
voluntary contributions, UNICEF depends on governments, NGOs and
the private sector to make its work
possible. In turn, the organization’s
credibility, impartiality and record
of results make it a valued partner.
UNICEF’s research on issues
affecting children routinely provides reference points for policy
makers and advocacy professionals. An enormous presence
on social media amplifies the
organization’s work to a growing
global audience.
In addition, UNICEF has
launched a new framework to bring
together advocacy, communications,
fundraising and public engagement
efforts on critical issues affecting
children – including refugee and

migration issues, child survival, early
childhood development and violence
against children. The approach is
already yielding positive results,
reaching key audiences and motivating them to action.
For more information on efforts
by UNICEF and its partners to
generate public awareness and
action on a range of issues affecting the world’s most vulnerable
children, see the ‘@UNICEF:
Advocacy in 2016’ items featured
throughout this report.
Most important, in everything
UNICEF does, it engages and
empowers young people to
have a voice in decisions that affect
them. In 2016, the world’s children
and adolescents needed that support as much as ever – and UNICEF
was there, 70 years on, still working
to achieve results for every child.

RESULTS

-----------------------Page 12 End-----------------------

The world’s children faced tremendous and, in some ways,
unprecedented challenges in 2016 – especially the poorest and
most vulnerable children who are always at the greatest risk in
times of crisis and insecurity. Against this backdrop, UNICEF and
its partners continued to deliver results in all of the programme
areas identified in its strategic plan for 2014 through 2017.
More than 125 million people were
in need of humanitarian assistance in
2016 as a result of conflict, displacement and natural disasters. The Zika
virus threatened the well-being of
women and children in 75 countries,
and the El Niño weather cycle intensified drought in dozens of countries
already suffering high levels of malnutrition and food insecurity. Armed
conflict continued in Iraq, South
Sudan, the Syrian Arab Republic and
elsewhere, and the global migration
crisis reached proportions not seen
since the Second World War.

It was also the first full year for
implementation of the Sustainable
Development Goals for 2030,
adopted by the international
community in late 2015 – and for
other wide-ranging global accords
on disaster risk reduction, climate
change and financing for development. Together with preparations for
UNICEF’s next four-year Strategic
Plan, these agreements provided a framework for programmatic
work in the years ahead.

UNICEF came into existence in the
aftermath of that conflict 70 years

ago. The crises that emerged or
intensified in 2016 were a stark
reminder that the need for the
organization is as great as ever.

Progress and disparities
The world has already seen important
progress for children. The number
of children who die before their fifth
birthday declined from 12.7 million
in 1990 to 5.9 million in 2015. The
proportion of undernourished children
has fallen by almost half since 1990.
The primary school net enrolment
rate in low- and middle-income countries reached 91 per cent in 2015,
while gender parity in primary education continued to improve. And the
number of new HIV infections among
children aged 0−14 years has declined by more than half since 2010.
Yet sharp disparities remain. Children
in sub-Saharan Africa are 12 times
more likely than those in high-income
countries to die before age 5. Within

countries, too, glaring inequities exist,
with children from the poorest households more than twice as likely to be
stunted and far less likely to complete
school. In most countries, inequality
is higher today than a generation ago,
including in middle-income countries,
where a majority of the world’s poor
children now live.
At the same time, approximately
535 million children live in countries
affected by conflict, natural disasters,
epidemics or other emergencies.
Worldwide, 50 million children have
been uprooted, including 28 million
driven from their homes by violence
and conflict. Millions more face violence, exploitation and abuse, including
trafficking and sexual violence. Natural
disasters and the impact of climate
change are being felt all over the world.

Efficient and agile
In 2016, to meet these challenges and many more, UNICEF was called upon
to do more for children, and to be more efficient, agile and innovative.

The following pages highlight the results that UNICEF and partners achieved
in priority programme sectors throughout the year. In every sector, these
results were aligned with UNICEF’s equity agenda, which aims to realize the
rights of every child, with accelerated progress for the most disadvantaged
and excluded children and adolescents.

Challenges and resilience
It was a challenging year for
vulnerable children affected by
violence, upheaval and natural
disasters around the world. By the
end of 2016, nearly a quarter of the
world’s child population – an estimated 535 million children – lived
in countries affected by conflict,
natural disaster, epidemics or other
emergencies. Their education was
jeopardized, their future put on
hold and, for many, their childhood
taken away.
UNICEF and partners responded to
344 such humanitarian situations
affecting children in 108 countries
in 2016, the largest number of
emergency responses since 2005.
Interventions ranged from the
immediate and urgent – providing
safe water, nutrition and vaccination
against disease – to longer-term assistance, helping displaced families
recover and communities rebuild.

Major emergencies persisted
in Iraq, Nigeria and the Lake

testing UNICEF’s ability to deliver
essential services at scale amidst
constant volatility. Simultaneously,
UNICEF responded to an ongoing
global migration and refugee

millions of children and exposed
them to risks of violence
and exploitation.
The severity of natural disasters – such as a devastating
earthquake in Ecuador and
Hurricane Matthew in Haiti – also
had an impact throughout the
year. Linking humanitarian and
development work, UNICEF
invested in risk reduction and
focused on strengthening community resilience to mitigate the
impact of future stresses and

Conflicts trigger migrant

#NoLostGeneration. In March,
on the fifth anniversary of
the conflict in the Syrian Arab
Republic, UNICEF releases
a report on the 3.7 million
Syrian children under age
5 whose lives have been
shaped by violence, fear and
displacement. The No Lost
Generation initiative, launched
by UNICEF and partners in
2013, continues working to
restore access to learning for
Syrian children.

Acute crises displaced millions of
families in 2016. UNICEF continued
its response to the most dangerous
and volatile situations, including
efforts in and around north-east
Nigeria, South Sudan and the
Syrian Arab Republic.
In the protracted Syrian conflict,
grave violations against children
were the highest on record in 2016.
Hundreds were killed by bombs and
shelling. Some deaths might have
been averted if the country’s medical facilities and practitioners were
not utterly depleted and subjected
to attacks.

In Turkey, UNICEF helped the
government expand a national
cash-transfer programme for
education to benefit 230,000
young Syrians and other vulnerable
children. Critical funding for this
effort came from the European
Union, a champion of the No Lost
Generation initiative to maintain
education for children at risk in
the region.
In Jordan, UNICEF helped strengthen another cash grant programme,
with solid results: 95 per cent of
recipient families reported that
the grants were sufficient for their
child-related expenses.

Conflict and insecurity
In Yemen, protracted conflict has
created a major humanitarian crisis.
Of a reported 18.8 million people
affected by the conflict in 2016,
more than half were children. An
estimated 1.6 million children were
forced from their homes. More than
2 million children under age 5 were
considered malnourished, with
462,000 acutely so. Adding to the
burden placed on collapsed health,
water and sanitation systems, an
outbreak of cholera raged in the
country late in the year.
In a March report, UNICEF highlighted the heavy toll of violence
on the children of Yemen. On the
ground, emergency teams provided
water and sanitation for 4.5 million
people and polio vaccinations
for approximately 4.7 million
children. Other emergency interventions included educational

Support for
humanitarian action
Reliable support from
trusted resource partners is
key to UNICEF’s humanitarian
response. In 2016, partners
played a prominent role in
establishing a nexus between
urgent humanitarian action and
longer-term development work
in countries dealing with serious
and protracted crises.
The United States of America
was the largest donor to UNICEF
humanitarian operations, followed
by Germany, the United Kingdom,
Japan and the United Nations
Central Emergency Response
Fund (CERF). During the cholera
outbreak in Somalia, CERF funds
enabled UNICEF and its partners
to reach a total of 390,000
people with hygiene promotion
messages through radio spots,
information, education and
communication materials – as
well as temporary access to safe
water through distribution of
water disinfection tablets.
The Government of
Japan went beyond emergency
relief, increasing its grant
aid to UNICEF – a multi-year
contribution – by more than
US$30 million above the 2015
level. This increase helped
bridge a growing gap between
humanitarian and development
assistance in Afghanistan,
Haiti, Myanmar, Pakistan
and Tajikistan. 

and psychosocial support, as
well as cash transfers for the
poorest families.
Violence and insecurity also
intensified in Iraq, affecting
10 million people in 2016. Battles
uprooted 85,000 in Fallujah and
left at least 1 million people in
the city of Mosul out of reach of
humanitarian assistance.
UNICEF co-led the United
Nations ‘cluster’ of organizations
working on education in Iraq and
supported water and sanitation
services for 1.2 million displaced
persons in the country – nearly
half of them children. UNICEF
provided learning supplies for
more than half a million children.
Some 5.8 million Iraqi children
were vaccinated against polio,
and about 32,000 received
measles vaccines. UNICEF
also supported newborn

ADVOCACY IN 2016

On a foggy Friday morning in
early 2016, Ganga Aryal, age 20
and nine months pregnant, sat
next to a heater in a UNICEF
tent shelter. It had been a few
days since she had arrived at
the Trishuli District Hospital,
which was largely destroyed by
the 7.8 magnitude earthquake
that rocked Nepal almost a year
earlier.
Immediately after the quake,
UNICEF provided medical tents
at damaged hospitals in the country’s 14 most affected districts so
that health-care services could
continue. Later, UNICEF set up
additional tents as temporary
homes for pregnant women,
new and lactating mothers and
their babies.

UNICEF | ANNUAL REPORT 2016

The tent where Ganga stayed
was warm and orderly, with about
a dozen beds lined up side by side.
UNICEF and the local National
Public Health Association insulated
the tents so that mothers and their
infants would have a warm place
to stay in the winter.
As a first-time mother, Ganga
was nervous about giving birth.
But in the tent, primary caregivers
like staff nurse Laxmi Ghimire kept
an eye out for her comfort and
health. “This tent is a safe place,”
Laxmi said. Ganga concurred.
“I have many worries,” she
admitted. “I worry about my home
in the village, my family and when
we will rebuild. But at least here
in this tent I know my baby will be
safe and warm.”

increasingly dangerous and

The violence and predations of the
Boko Haram militia created a humanitarian emergency in the Lake
Chad Basin, as 2.4 million people
fled and dispersed across the Far
North region of Cameroon, western
Chad, south-eastern Niger and
north-eastern Nigeria. UNICEF
and partners scaled up emergency
measures in nutrition, WASH,
education and protection, tracking
unaccompanied children and
supporting safe recreational activities in the affected areas in 2016.

Support for
humanitarian action
UNICEF’s humanitarian
response in the Syrian Arab
Republic and neighbouring
countries affected by conflict
and refugee flows received
key support from the European
Commission-Directorate
General for European Civil
Protection and Humanitarian Aid
Operations, which supported
education programmes for
230,000 vulnerable refugee
children in Turkey, along with
protection for their families.
Germany, another major
contributor to the crisis response,
donated US$45 million to pay
teacher salaries in Turkey,
providing access to schooling
for more than 150,000 Syrian
refugee children.
UNICEF also recognized
the success of a new partnership
in humanitarian action; since
January 2016, the Louis Vuitton
for UNICEF partnership has
helped raise funds for humanitarian support in Nigeria and the
Syrian Arab Republic, bringing
hope to children who have
endured the shocks and stresses of war and deprivation.

In Nigeria itself, aid workers reached
previously inaccessible communities, only to find an acute humanitarian situation. Alarming rates of child
malnutrition and an outbreak of polio
were UNICEF’s immediate priorities.

#ChildrenFirst.
In September, UNICEF issues
a report, Uprooted, with new
data about the situation of
refugee and migrant children
worldwide. The report
notes that nearly 50 million
children have been uprooted,
with 28 million driven from
their homes by conflicts and
millions more migrating for a
better, safer life – but facing
further dangers in transit.

Coping with disasters
During 2016, El Niño – an extreme weather pattern resulting
from variations in ocean temperatures – contributed to the worst
drought in 35 years in much of
southern Africa. The drought
drastically reduced food security
from Angola to Madagascar. In
response, UNICEF delivered
ready-to-use therapeutic foods
throughout the region, along
with support for health care
and safe water.
The year’s two deadliest natural disasters occurred in the Americas.

Then in October, Hurricane
Matthew left 807,000 Haitians
in need of life-saving assistance
and 175,000 displaced. Haiti had
already been suffering from an
El Niño-induced drought, and
UNICEF supported the government’s response with emergency
WASH services and cholera
vaccinations. After the hurricane,
UNICEF and partners redoubled
emergency interventions to stem
water-borne diseases, restore
damaged schools and safeguard
unaccompanied children. The hurricane response was an example
of strong preparedness and prepositioning of emergency supplies.

Emergence of the
Zika virus
One of the most urgent international health concerns in 2016
arose with the emergence of
the Zika virus in Latin America.
In February, the World Health
Organization declared that the
mosquito-borne virus – which
causes severe deformities in
unborn foetuses, notably microcephaly – was a public health
emergency. New research finds
that the Zika virus affects children
beyond microcephaly, impairing
their eyesight, hearing and physical and intellectual development.

UNICEF and partners contributed
to the fight against Zika on
many fronts in 2016: supporting
government responses; identifying
mosquito-reduction techniques
and personal protection strategies;
and focusing on sexual and
reproductive health issues
surrounding transmission.

@UNICEFinnovation 2016

Real-time data on Zika

UNICEF activates its U-Report
social messaging tool in Latin
America and the Caribbean in
response to the outbreak of the Zika
virus. Its goals: to provide life-saving
information to households in areas
affected by the virus – which poses
particular dangers for pregnant
women and their unborn foetuses
– and enable young people to report
in real time on the situation in their
communities. UNICEF uses such
reports to improve access to information for vulnerable children and
women, leading to the launch of the
first virtual online Zika Information
Centre in January 2017.

By the end of the year, 75 countries
and territories around the world
reported cases of mosquito-borne
transmission. The majority of
these were in Latin America and
the Caribbean, where thousands
of children had been born
with congenital malformations
associated with Zika.

Resources and results
Responding to humanitarian emergencies has been central to UNICEF’s
work ever since its founding seven decades ago. Today, as the world
struggles to cope with protracted conflicts on many fronts, a historic
migration crisis, challenging new epidemics and climate-induced disasters,
UNICEF’s emergency operations are at the heart of the organization’s
equity efforts, benefitting the most vulnerable and hard-to-reach children
and adolescents.
In the face of so many crises, however, insufficient resources and
inadequate humanitarian access limited the overall impact that UNICEF
and its partners were able to make in emergency response during 2016.
The contributions of myriad resource partners – including governments,
UNICEF National Committees and corporate partners – were critical.
But more predictable, more flexible and longer-term funding is essential
to the success of future emergency operations.

Procured 2.5
billion doses

100 countries.

Protecting children with
basic immunization
By the end of 2016, a steady
decline in the rate of child mortality since 2000 had saved the
lives of 48 million children who
would not have survived to see
their fifth birthday if the rate had
remained level.
Robust immunization programmes and supplementary
campaigns targeting the children
most in need saved many of those
lives. With the number of unvaccinated children having dropped
below 20 million in 2015, UNICEF
and partners doubled down on
efforts to ensure more equitable
preventive coverage as envisioned
by the Global Vaccine Action Plan.
UNICEF procured 2.5 billion doses
of vaccines for children in approximately 100 countries in 2016,
reaching almost half of the world’s
under-five children.

UNICEF also supported
supplementary measles and

Closing in on polio
Support for child health
During 2016, UNICEF relied on
contributions from the World
Bank Group’s International
Development Association (IDA)
and UNICEF supported national
governments in expanding immunization coverage, improving
nutrition and strengthening
health systems in Egypt, Haiti,
Mali and Yemen. IDA also
enabled UNICEF and the World
Health Organization to support
a national campaign vaccinating
1.5 million Yemeni children
against polio.
In the corporate sector, ‘la
Caixa’ Banking Foundation joined
forces with UNICEF to tackle
child pneumonia mortality, the
world’s number one infectious
killer of children under age 5.
This collaboration – which commenced in late 2015 – seeks to
advance the use of self-sustained
and innovative pneumonia diagnoses by front-line health workers,
and ensure children’s access to
proper treatment.
In its first year, the partnership
yielded significant results.
Among other outcomes in 2016,
it supported the identification of
diagnostic devices and developed
a procurement strategy to ensure
their scaled-up use.

The year 2016 saw the smallest
number of children paralyzed by polio
in history and the wild poliovirus
on the verge of eradication. About
three dozen cases occurred in small
geographical areas of three countries:
Afghanistan, Nigeria and Pakistan.
Key to UNICEF’s polio eradication
effort was the financial support of
the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation,
Rotary International, the U.S.
Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, and the Governments
of Canada, Germany and Japan.
This support allowed UNICEF
to deploy more than 17,000 full-time,
community-based vaccinators – most
of them female – in the parts of
Pakistan with the highest remaining
risk of polio.
Thanks to the vaccinators, these
areas recorded the highest immunization coverage in the country’s
history. The proportion of children
missed by polio vaccination campaigns fell from 25 per cent in 2014

large-scale emergency immunization activities across the Lake
Chad region. A total of 116 million
children in Cameroon, the Central
African Republic, Chad, Niger and
Nigeria were vaccinated. UNICEF
combined the immunization effort
with a range of humanitarian
services, including screening for
acute malnutrition, as well as distribution of vitamin A and zinc supplements, anti-parasite treatment
and insecticide-treated nets.

Saving Joel: A premature baby gets early help in Uruguay

Born prematurely in late 2016,
Joel came into the world in an
impoverished area of Toledo,
a small town in the Department
of Canelones, Uruguay. The
baby did not have an easy time
at first. “He was born with low
weight, 1.9 kilograms,” explained
Joel’s father. “His lungs hadn’t
developed properly.”
Joel’s parents received aid
from a local early childhood
programme, Canelones Crece
Contigo, which is supported by
UNICEF. Run by the Canelones
City Council since 2008, the
programme assists vulnerable
parents and their children,
counselling and assisting them
with health care, nutrition and
other services.

Canelones Crece Contigo has
helped increase the percentage
of women receiving six or more
prenatal check-ups and the
proportion of children registered
at birth in the community. It has
also contributed to improved food
security in Canelones households,
as well as the wider adoption of
parenting practices that enhance
the cognitive development of
young children. Because of the
programme’s success, the government decided to make it national,
creating Uruguay Crece Contigo.
After his rough start, little Joel
progressively drank more breastmilk and was growing at a regular
pace. His parents hope that he will
continue to grow up and develop

Fighting new epidemics

One is too many

UNICEF and partners were on
the front lines of the fight against
Zika, a mosquito-borne disease that
affected at least 75 countries in
Africa, Asia, and Latin America and
the Caribbean in 2016.

Even as the global health community
celebrated success against Ebola
and polio, easily preventable
diseases such as pneumonia and
diarrhoea remained the leading
killers of children. In 2016, nearly
one quarter of all under-five
deaths were attributed to one of
these diseases.

UNICEF communication teams
informed communities about
how best to protect themselves
against a disease with devastating
effects on newborns – including microcephaly, birth defects and
long-term disability. Cross-sectoral
strategies, like Brazil’s Network for
Inclusion project, created strong
networks for caregivers of children
affected by the Zika virus. The
project builds on existing health-care
services in local communities and
combines them with family-based
interventions supported by UNICEF.
In addition, UNICEF contributed to
interagency efforts for diagnostic,
research and vaccine development,
with an eye to eliminating Zika’s ongoing risk for pregnant women and
their children.

Separately, another terrible disease
was finally brought under control
in West Africa in early 2016. On
January 14, the World Health
Organization declared the end of
the Ebola outbreak. UNICEF’s West
and Central Africa Regional Office
played a key role in recovery plans
for the affected countries: Guinea,
Liberia and Sierra Leone. Providing
technical assistance to build more
resilient local health systems,
UNICEF helped communities improve their preparedness for potential future epidemics.

UNICEF | ANNUAL REPORT 2016

In a new report entitled One Is
Too Many: Ending child deaths
from pneumonia and diarrhoea,
UNICEF cited the combined annual
toll of these illnesses – 1.4 million
deaths – as a needless tragedy
and a “threat to the sustainable
development of the world’s
poorest nations.”
In just one example of the organization’s commitment to the
survival and well-being of the
most disadvantaged children,
UNICEF in the Democratic Republic
of the Congo helped scale up

Beyond childhood
Meanwhile, UNICEF expanded its
focus on children’s second decade
of life with improved strategies for
reducing adolescent pregnancy and
preventing HIV infection among
young people. In Argentina, for
example, where 14.7 per cent
of babies are born to adolescent
girls, UNICEF is working with
the Ministry of Health to reduce
adolescent pregnancies and build
gender-based equity in health care.

In 2016, UNICEF continued its
cross-sectoral collaboration to
reduce AIDS-related deaths
by 65 per cent and new HIV
infections among adolescents
by 75 per cent by 2020. Through

Inequity and insecurity

@UNICEF:
ADVOCACY IN 2016
#Immunization.
UNICEF and partners mark
World Immunization Week
in April to help refocus
public attention on the
importance of vaccination
for all children. Despite great
progress, 18.7 million babies
– nearly 20 per cent – still do
not receive a complete set of
commonly available vaccines
and are, therefore, vulnerable
to life-threatening diseases.

But despite progress, inequities persist: Today, 80 per cent of under-five
mortality is concentrated in Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, with the latter region
shouldering half of that burden. The new global challenge is to reduce stillbirths
and the deaths that occur in the first 28 days of life. Nearly half of all deaths of
children under age 5 occur in that initial month – the most vulnerable period.
Vulnerability is linked to conflict and insecurity as well. In 2016, one quarter of
the world’s children lived in war zones or disaster-stricken countries, amidst
widespread violence, deprivation and displacement. These factors left them
extremely susceptible to disease, hunger, multiple forms of abuse and with
a severe lack of access to essential services.

The sheer number of people living in insecurity is emerging as a forceful inequity beyond the well-known urban/rural, wealth and gender divides. This reality

Preventing vertical
transmission of HIV

Reaching adolescents
at risk

Prevention of mother-to-child
transmission, a pillar of UNICEF’s
efforts to stop the spread of HIV
and AIDS, has averted millions of
infections and saved millions of
lives. In 2016, Armenia, Belarus
and Thailand received World
Health Organization certification
for eliminating vertical transmission of HIV from mother to child,
following decades of progress
and support from UNICEF and
its partners.

Moreover, the progress made
to beat back HIV and AIDS has
not been equitably distributed. It
varies from region to region, with
sub-Saharan Africa faring worst.
And adolescents, in particular, are
being left behind.

Cuba had achieved elimination in
2015, and several other countries
are on the verge of reaching
that goal.
In South Africa, for example,
paediatric infections have fallen
sharply. Now the government
has embarked on a ‘last mile’
agenda to eliminate them within
five years. UNICEF is contributing
to the effort with its RapidPro
open-source application, which
delivers real-time information
to connect households and
communities to prevention and
treatment services.
But prevention of vertical transmission of HIV must remain a central
focus everywhere. Although the
number of new paediatric infections has declined, children are still
at risk. As of 2015 – the last year
for which a reliable estimate is
available – at least 1.4 million pregnant women were living with HIV.

OPPOSITE PAGE: A mother holds

As long as gaps in access to services for pregnant mothers persist,
children who could otherwise be
protected will continue to be exposed to HIV. In 2015, the majority
of the new infections among children under age 15 were contracted
through vertical transmission.

UNICEF | ANNUAL REPORT 2016

Some 1.8 million 10- to
19-year-olds are living with HIV
globally, and AIDS is one of the
leading causes of death among adolescents. In fact, theirs is the only
age group in which AIDS-related
deaths are rising, not falling. Girls
are more at risk than boys, making
up 65 per cent of those affected.
Recognizing that the window
of opportunity for the adolescent population is narrow,
UNICEF – together with
UNAIDS, the U.S. President’s
Emergency Plan for AIDS
Relief and the World Health
Organization – announced a plan in
2016 to put prevention of new HIV
infections in 15- to 19-year-olds
on a ‘super fast-track.’ Endorsed
at the United Nations High-Level
Meeting on Ending AIDS in
June, the plan aims to eliminate
mother-to-child transmission of
HIV, reduce the rate of new HIV
infections among adolescents
and young women, and increase
HIV treatment for both children
and adolescents.
Under the banner ‘Start Free, Stay
Free, AIDS Free,’ this framework
highlights the targets set by
UNAIDS to end HIV and AIDS in
children, adolescents and young
women by 2020.

-----------------------Page 30 End-----------------------

National and
community-led efforts
Beyond such global initiatives, national
and community-led efforts will be vital
to expanding awareness and access
to HIV prevention and treatment.
Throughout 2016, UNICEF engaged
with countries around the world to help
bolster local responses to HIV and AIDS.
Specific efforts included support for a national prevention of
mother-to-child-transmission

assessment in Myanmar, as
well as help with securing
emergency provisions of ARV
drugs in Ukraine. UNICEF
also worked with partners
on AIDS education initiatives
with broad social and health
impacts. In Mozambique, for
example, a youth-led SMS
text-messaging platform with
64,000 users provided a forum
for questions about HIV
transmission and sexual and
reproductive health.

@UNICEFinnovation 2016

Answers on HIV
and AIDS

Throughout the year, UNICEF
continues to build and expand
its U-Report social messaging
tool, designed to help adolescents and young people around
the world speak out on issues
that affect them. U-Report also
allows its users to anonymously
text questions about HIV and
AIDS, and get the answers they
need. In doing so, it provides a
critical communication tool and
information source, especially
for youth at risk of HIV infection
or other potential threats to
their health and well-being.
U-Report has some 3 million
registered users in more than
30 countries. 

No time for complacency
But even as such efforts continue – as UNICEF’s seventh stocktaking
report on the epidemic concluded in December 2016 – any sense of
complacency towards HIV and AIDS could result in backsliding on the
important progress made to date.

© UNICEF/UN048435/PIROZZI

Overall financing for HIV response is stagnant or, worse, declining at the
very time that it should be increased in order to end the epidemic once
and for all. UNICEF continues to advocate for greater resources from
donor countries, aid agencies and governments in countries with the
greatest HIV burdens. Perhaps more important, its wide-ranging interventions continue to yield valuable lessons and results aimed at improving the
lives of children and adolescents at risk of – or living with – HIV and AIDS.

UNICEF also supported the
construction and rehabilitation of
WASH facilities in 7,138 schools
across 71 countries, along with similar facilities at 1,654 health clinics
in 44 countries.

The largest non-emergency
WASH programmes are located in
sub-Saharan Africa, including the
Democratic Republic of the Congo,
Ethiopia and Nigeria. In these countries and others around the world,
WASH underpins UNICEF’s overall
results for children and its work to
achieve many of the 2030 global
goals, including those related to
nutrition, health, education, gender
equality, resilience and climate
change. Accordingly, WASH programmes are aligned and increasingly integrated with UNICEF’s efforts
in other sectors.

Given these results – combined with results from the
preceding two years – UNICEF
and partners provided WASH
support to more than 100 million

But troubling disparities persist. In
2015, 663 million people, most of
them poor and living in rural areas,
did not have access to an improved
drinking water source.

-----------------------Page 32 End-----------------------

Sustainable solutions
With households worldwide already
affected by climate variability, the
WASH sector faces additional challenges. Climate change has a negative impact on water availability and
quality, as well as the performance
of sanitation systems. And the
most vulnerable communities in
low- and middle-income countries
bear the brunt.

#WaterIs.
During World Water Week
in August, UNICEF notes
that the lack of access to safe
water disproportionately
affects women and girls, who
collectively spend as much
as 200 million hours a day
collecting this vital resource.
The opportunity costs of
collecting water are high
– for example, reducing the
time women can spend on
other tasks and interfering
with children’s education.

These strategies incorporate
forward thinking about
the sustainability of vital
ecosystems for maximum
economy and equity
in water management.

Consequently, UNICEF and its
WASH partners have been closely
studying fresh targets in the safe
and sustainable provision of drinking
water. Careful management and enhanced monitoring of water supplies
are necessary to achieve universal
and equitable access, as prescribed
by the global goals for 2030.

@UNICEF:

UNICEF’s safe-water
initiatives in 2016 emphasized
interventions for children and
women within a broader agenda
that includes protecting and
restoring water sources and
improving water quality by
reducing pollution. By the end
of 2016, 38 countries were

Support for water,
sanitation and hygiene
UNICEF’s water, sanitation
and hygiene (WASH) teams rely
on the support of local public
and private partnerships to
achieve access to safe water
and improved sanitation for
all, including women and girls,
people with disabilities and
the poor.
The Cartier Charitable
Foundation has been a UNICEF
global partner since 2014.
The foundation backs UNICEF
WASH programmes in China,
India and Madagascar with a
grant of $6.7 million. It also
supports quality education and
disaster risk reduction efforts.
Domestos, the Unilever
company’s leading toilet cleaner
brand, has partnered with
UNICEF since 2012 to support
global sanitation programmes.
As of 2016, the partnership
had helped more than 6 million
people gain access to toilets
through behaviour-change and
capacity-building initiatives.
UNICEF also worked with
Domestos to raise awareness
about the sanitation crisis
globally – and UNICEF and
Unilever were both involved
in creating and developing
the WASH4Work initiative to
support business action towards
meeting the 2030 global goal
on universal access to water

@UNICEF:

In October 2016, just two
days after Al Houd, south of
Mosul, was retaken by Iraqi forces,
a UNICEF mission delivered water
and hygiene supplies to the town’s
1,500 families.
It was an off-road convoy,
due to heavily mined roads, and
the desert sky was black with
the smoke of burning oil fields.
At the end of the road was an
even eerier sight: a ghost town.
It seemed that the population
of Al Houd had fled or remained
in hiding.
Once the convoy reached
the town centre, representatives
of UNICEF’s local partner,
the Women Empowerment
Organization, were on hand to help

kits and water buckets. At last
the citizens of Al Houd appeared,
eager to pick up supplies of safe
drinking water.
The route back led through
Al Qayyarah, a town that looked
a lot like Al Houd when it was
retaken two months earlier but
had come back to life. Shops
were open and people were out –
including Zainab, a single mother
who had walked to Al Qayyarah
from Al Houd with her four young
daughters. She recalled two years
of terror for her family before
concluding, “I want to go home,
to my family, and put my children
back in school.”
It’s a hope that is shared
widely, no doubt, by Zainab’s
friends and neighbours in Al Houd.

Community approach
to sanitation
Within the WASH sector, sanitation
trends are improving, but an estimated 2.4 billion people worldwide still
were not using improved sanitation
facilities in 2015.
UNICEF supports a community
approach to total sanitation. National
and subnational programmes taking
this approach had a significant
impact on millions of people in 2016,
as 33,800 communities gained
open-defecation-free status.

@UNICEF:

Support for water,
sanitation and hygiene

And UNICEF’s extensive direct support for the construction of WASH
facilities in schools and health clinics
often included toilet and washing
facilities for children with disabilities.
In the Lao People’s Democratic
Republic, more than 24,000 schoolchildren benefitted from newly
accessible WASH facilities. In Ghana,
approximately 68,000 students were
provided with disability-sensitive
facilities. In Fiji, a post-cyclone ‘build
back better’ campaign installed accessible sanitation and handwashing
facilities for the first time in many of
the country’s schools.

Sweden, the leading resource
partner of UNICEF WASH
programmes in 2016, provided
generous funding to help
UNICEF advance its agenda
on gender and disability
rights in the sector. Sweden
also supported UNICEF’s
partnership efforts with
the private sector aimed at
increasing capacity to provide
water and sanitation solutions
in humanitarian situations.
Another key partner, the
United Kingdom Department
for International Development
(DFID), has had a long and close
relationship with UNICEF on
WASH initiatives. That relationship was further strengthened
in 2016 through coordinated
action on the Sanitation and
Water for All partnership and
the World Health Organization/
UNICEF Joint Monitoring
Programme for Water Supply
and Sanitation. In addition to
reaching more than 5 million
people with water, sanitation
and hygiene in 12 countries,
DFID’s support created an important platform for developing
new ways of working on value
for money, results reporting,
sustainability, system strengthening and evaluation.

WASH projects that UNICEF supported in 2016 put an emphasis
on social inclusion for marginalized
children and families as well. In Viet

WASH in emergencies
@UNICEFinnovation 2016

Real-time monitoring,
rapid response

UNICEF leverages real-time data
to strengthen its response to
the urgent water and sanitation
needs of children and families
at risk. In Ethiopia, for example,
smartphone-based monitoring
in drought-affected areas
produces current data on failing
water points, triggering the early
allocation of water tankering
and other emergency measures
to maintain the local supply
of safe water. UNICEF also
uses real-time data to monitor
the status of water sources in
drought-prone areas of India
and Zimbabwe.

In the aftermath of Hurricane
Matthew, UNICEF, with support
from key partners such as Fútbol
Club Barcelona, worked with the
Government of Haiti to battle a cholera outbreak. During the response,
more than 300,000 individuals, including approximately 126,000 children, were provided with clean
water on a daily basis.
In the Syrian Arab Republic and
other countries affected by crisis
in the region, UNICEF and partners
reached more than 14 million people
with improved and sustained access
to safe drinking water and sanitation.
In South Sudan, emergency WASH
teams provided 742,000 people with
water and 252,000 with sanitation.
In Iraq, WASH teams reached more
than 1.2 million displaced people
with water and sanitation services.

These were just a few of the hundreds of humanitarian actions that
made 2016 the largest year ever
for UNICEF’s emergency WASH
response programmes. In total, the
organization spent US$506 million
in humanitarian situations to provide
28.8 million people with access
to safe water and 7.2 million with
improved sanitation.
In 2017 and beyond, UNICEF
plans to continue working for
WASH results in humanitarian
situations while also improving
its ongoing work in this sector.
At the same time, it will move in
new directions. In line with a new
WASH strategy developed in
2016, UNICEF will invest in more
climate-resilient WASH systems
and behaviours, increase its presence in urban areas and expand its
collaboration with private-sector
partners worldwide.

worldwide drop to a new low,
while redoubling efforts to
reach those left behind.

Reaching the unreached

‘From the first hour’

Good nutrition is one of the greatest investments to be made in improving global welfare. Nutritious
diets fuel children’s growth, drive
brain development, strengthen
learning potential, enhance productivity into adulthood and pave the
way to a more sustainable future.

Among the global goals adopted by
United Nations Member States in
2015 is the elimination of preventable
child deaths by 2030. As a starting
point, UNICEF and partners have
shone a spotlight on the importance
of infant and early childhood feeding.

Even as chronic malnutrition was
recorded at its lowest level among
children in history in 2016, the
number of children who are still
suffering from either stunting or
wasting is alarming. Approximately
155 million children worldwide are
stunted in growth. Another 52 million are threatened by wasting,
including 17 million who suffer
from severe wasting. That’s why
nearly 60 countries have joined the
Scaling Up Nutrition movement
since 2010.

It is well established that allowing a newborn to breastfeed within
the first hour of life is key to ensuring
that the infant will thrive. Yet current
data show that less than half of all
newborns are put to the breast immediately after birth.
A 2016 UNICEF report – From the
First Hour of Life: Making the case
for improved infant and young child
feeding everywhere – pointed out
that immediate breastfeeding must
become more commonplace. Among
other findings, the report showed
that in some regions, skilled birth
attendants were not supporting
mothers’ breastfeeding within the
first hour after delivery.

Support for nutrition
Partnerships contributed to
UNICEF’s efforts to improve
child nutrition throughout 2016.
In the Niger, for example,
UNICEF supported a package
of high-impact nutrition
interventions in partnership with
the European Union and various
non-governmental organizations.
The interventions included
counselling on infant and young
child feeding in 20 districts and
the training of more than 13,700
community health volunteers.
Both UNICEF and the
World Food Programme (WFP)
partnered with the Food and
Agriculture Organization of
the United Nations in 2016 to
adopt a community-based Joint
Resilience Strategy. The strategy aims to reduce the impact of
shocks by enhancing productive
livelihoods, increasing access
to basic services and providing
predictable safety nets. UNICEF
and WFP are also scaling up
a joint, cash-based initiative
targeting 60,000 households
in regions severely affected by
drought. Through this coordinated approach, UNICEF complements WFP food vouchers with
monthly cash transfers.
At the global level in 2016,
UNICEF remained active in
partnerships such as Scaling Up
Nutrition, a growing movement
that supports country-level
efforts to end hunger and
malnutrition by 2030.

As a champion of immediate and
exclusive breastfeeding for at least
the first six months of an infant’s
life, UNICEF has supported the
Breastfeeding Advocacy Initiative.
The global initiative provides a platform for advancing policies and
investments in support of improved
infant and young child feeding.
In 2016, 41 countries reported exclusive breastfeeding rates of more
than 50 per cent among infants
younger than 6 months of age. In

Beyond exclusive breastfeeding,
good nutrition requires that children be introduced to their first
foods, known as complementary
foods, after the first six months
of life.

of thousands of children were
estimated to be severely malnourished in the country. For a child
with severe acute malnutrition,
death from illnesses such as
malaria or pneumonia is up to
nine times more likely than for
a healthy child.
UNICEF treated more than
200,000 children during the
year, partnering with local health
workers to provide families in
the most remote locations with
basic nutrition screening and
therapeutic feeding.

The nutrition agenda

Help for every child

While the figures on wasting and
stunting are always cause for
concern, fresh data on the number
of overweight children have raised
another red flag for global nutrition.

UNICEF’s nutrition initiatives
continued to prioritize the most
disadvantaged children in 2016. Of
the millions of children screened and
treated for SAM through UNICEF
partnerships, 2.3 million were in
humanitarian crisis zones. In South
Sudan alone, UNICEF-supported
therapeutic feeding programmes
reached 50 per cent more severely
wasted children under age 5 in
2016 than in 2015.

According to a report released
by UNICEF, the World Health
Organization and the World Bank
in 2016, there were 41 million overweight children around the world
in 2015 – an increase of more than
10 million since 2000. This spike
will need to be addressed as part
of the overall nutrition agenda for
countries across the socio-economic
spectrum, including low- and
middle-income countries.
UNICEF worked on another agenda
item, micronutrients, to improve policies for the provision of vitamins and
essential nutrients, while supporting
micronutrient supplementation and
fortification for the children and
women most in need. According to
the latest global figures for 2016,
273 million children from 6 to 59
months of age received two annual
doses of vitamin A supplements in
priority countries.
UNICEF continued to support national programmes and policies to prevent iron-deficiency anaemia as well.
The number of countries reaching
children with micronutrient powders
tripled between 2011 and 2016,
increasing from 22 to 65. These
programmes reached more than
10 million children, including 8.3 million with UNICEF support, in 2016.

When a severe drought struck
Ethiopia, children in the most
difficult-to-reach communities
were disproportionately affected.
But the government’s response
incorporated UNICEF-supported
mobile health and nutrition teams,
maximizing effectiveness and
securing a national health equity
strategy targeting the most
marginalized communities.

In January, UNICEF releases
an analysis showing that
almost one in four children
living in conflict zones is not

children of primary and
lower secondary-school age
in 22 countries affected by
conflict, nearly 24 million
are not getting an education.

in 52 per cent
of countries
having quality early learning

In the classroom, those disparities
are stark. More than 121 million
children of primary and lower

learn because of a lack of access
to quality education.

A year after the adoption of the

and facilitating improved learning
outcomes and equitable, inclusive

The Sustainable Development
Goal for education calls for the
international community to “ensure
inclusive and equitable quality
education and promote lifelong
learning opportunities for all” by
2030. Within this broad agenda,
UNICEF continues to focus on the
educational needs of the most
marginalized, recognizing that
exclusion is driven by poverty,
conflict, gender, ethnicity, disability
and child labour.

In addition, the Education Cannot
Wait fund was launched in 2016 to
mobilize resources for continued
learning by children living in emergencies and protracted crises. The
fund takes a collaborative approach
to keeping crisis-affected children
and adolescents in school, generating fresh energy and new strategies
for the delivery of education in some
of the world’s most dangerous humanitarian situations. UNICEF is the
temporary host of this initiative.

Through programmes implemented
in 2016, UNICEF and partners
provided learning materials to
15.7 million children, equipped
more than 330,000 classrooms

half of all refugees worldwide
are children.

Education in emergencies

In the Syrian Arab Republic, where
nearly one in three schools is
unusable or destroyed, UNICEF’s
education interventions benefitted
almost 3.5 million schoolchildren. Still, more than 1.7 million
children were denied access
to basic education.

Data inform key decisions

UNICEF’s commitment to education
for every child means increasing its
support for the growing number of
children affected by humanitarian
crises. In 2016, that entailed working with partners to support basic
education for 11.7 million of these
vulnerable children. Education was
part of the emergency response
in a range of countries in crisis,
from the Central African Republic to
South Sudan to Ukraine.

UNICEF offices in several
countries – including Burkina
Faso, Lesotho and Papua New
Guinea – work with governments
on embedding mobile apps into
education systems to inform
decisions on access to quality
learning. In Sierra Leone, where
real-time data reported via SMS
messages aided the response
to the Ebola outbreak in 2015,
UNICEF supports the collection
of data on critical school-level
indicators to guide policy and
programming. In Uganda,
10,000 citizen-reporters in
37 districts contribute local data
to an integrated ‘dashboard’ used
by the Ministry of Education
and Sports.

ADVOCACY IN 2016

It was the end of August 2016,
and the excitement was palpable.
Abdul Malek, age 7, was about to
attend school for the first time. His
older brothers Hamzah and Bakr
went to school briefly before their
family left home in Dera’a, in the
Syrian Arab Republic, and for a
short time after they arrived here
in Jordan. But they had not seen
a classroom since.
“I missed my friends, I missed
my teachers and I just missed
learning a lot of things,” said Bakr,
age 10. “Now I cannot wait to
start school again.”
The boys’ mother, Wafa’a
Malek, said they had arrived three
years earlier and settled in Irbid,
north of Amman. Her husband
decided to go to Germany via
Turkey so that he could get a job
and take care of the family.

UNICEF | ANNUAL REPORT 2016

While Wafa’a’s sons did not
have access to formal education,
she sent them to a youth centre
that was supported by UNICEF and
run by the Islamic Charity Centre
Society. But now Abdul, Bakr
and Hamzah had been enrolled in
school under a massive campaign
by the Government of Jordan.
Dubbed ‘Learning for All –
Back-to-School’ and backed by
UNICEF, the campaign rolled out
through media channels and doorto-door outreach. It encouraged
parents and caregivers of all
children – regardless of their
nationality or status – to get
them enrolled.
“I want to become a doctor
so I can help people,” Bakr said
on the eve of his return to school.
“But I also know I will make a lot
of money.”

The early years

Inclusive, equitable systems

While funding challenges persist,
there is also increased global
awareness of the outsized impact of
early learning on children’s cognitive
development and future prospects.
Early learning opportunities are
essential to improving learning outcomes and tackling social inequities.

On the other end of the education
spectrum, UNICEF addressed
the gaps in school enrolment and
attendance for older students by
supporting the expansion of secondary education to rural areas – and to
populations of adolescents no longer
enrolled in formal schooling.

Twenty-seven per cent of UNICEF
programme countries reported that
more than a quarter of young children from the poorest households
were enrolled in early childhood education in 2016. The number of countries reporting effective policies and
quality early learning programmes
increased from 31 per cent in 2013
to 52 per cent in 2016.

All these interventions and many
more are at the heart of UNICEF’s
mission to make the benefits of
education more equitable across
the board. In fact, UNICEF and
partners pursued equitable education targets in 155 countries
in 2016. With a focus on building
learning assessment systems,
child-friendly school standards,
non-formal education and bilingual
instruction, the organization backed
efforts to identify and remove
barriers to learning for the most
marginalized children.

In Uganda, for example, children are
eligible for a free year of pre-primary
school as part of an integrated early
childhood development (ECD) policy
adopted by the government in 2016.
UNICEF Uganda launched a major
campaign to promote ECD
through media channels and
social mobilization.
In China, effective advocacy and
new governmental guidelines have
made early childhood learning a high
priority. At integrated ECD sites supported by UNICEF in four provinces,
developmental delays reportedly
saw a reduction of 37 per cent attributable to the intervention between
2013 and 2016.

Support for education
and early learning
As one of UNICEF’s top
resource partners for thematic
funding, Norway contributed
approximately US$80 million
in 2016, 89 per cent of which
was allocated to education –
with a focus on education in
humanitarian settings.
The Government of Germany
provided nearly US$50 million to
the Reaching All Children with
Education initiative in Lebanon
and about US$15 million to
support Zimbabwe’s Education
Development Fund, in addition
to supporting access to schooling for Syrian refugee children.
With support from the
European Union Regional
Trust Fund in Response to the
Syria Crisis (also known as
the ‘Madad’ Fund), UNICEF
assisted more than 320,000
children and adolescents in
Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey, as
part of the No Lost Generation
education initiative.

UNICEF continued to call for
increased data, awareness and
dialogue to improve education
opportunities for children with disabilities. In Egypt, UNICEF supported
the enrolment of 1,326 children with
disabilities into 120 mainstream
public schools and equipped those
schools with inclusive learning resource rooms. In Serbia, parents of
disabled students in 17 educational
facilities received peer support and
mentoring by teachers on individual
education planning.

Among corporate supporters, H&M Foundation provided a
grant of US$5.3 million that will
help provide 480,000 children in
Myanmar with quality primary
and lower secondary education.
In its second year, UNICEF’s
partnership on early childhood
development with the LEGO
Group and LEGO Foundation
established an online training
platform for 150,000 teachers
and other practitioners in South
Africa. The LEGO Group was
also instrumental in developing
an industry-first digital child
safety policy.

UNICEF emphasized early education
in emergency contexts, as well.
When Fiji and the Pacific islands
were hit by a tropical cyclone in
February 2016, for instance, UNICEF
distributed 332 kits to early childhood centres and kindergartens,
reaching more than 13,000 young
children to ensure continuity in their
learning and development.

Girls’ education
@UNICEF:

In 2016, fully one third of all UNICEF programme countries officially
recognized girls’ secondary education as a priority and budgeted accordingly
for more gender-responsive education systems at the national, subnational
and school levels.

Through their long-standing
Power for Youth programme,
ING and UNICEF have reached
close to 100,000 children with
innovative learning, financial
literacy and skills development.
The partnership has also
helped strengthen systems and
services for more than 10 million
adolescent girls and boys.

UNICEF also enabled more than 334,000 girls to gain access to education
in Iraq. In Pakistan, it supported District Plans focused on breaking down
gender barriers in 60 districts across two provinces. And UNICEF provided
more than 24,000 girls in Nigeria with cash transfers so they could pay
school fees.

Support for education
and early learning

Quality education for girls and boys alike remains central to UNICEF’s
vision of inclusion, even as it addresses daunting challenges such as
urbanization, migration and climate change. Stronger data, innovation and
partnership will be at the core of this work – as will UNICEF’s commitment
to the simple idea that every child has the right to learn.

Director Anthony Lake
serves as founding co-chair
of the partnership’s board.

Protection in conflict zones
The fact that so many parents
choose the danger and uncertainty
of migration is testament to the
harsh circumstances in their home
communities. A failed harvest or
seasonal drought caused by climate
change can be the deciding factor for
poor and vulnerable families wondering whether to stay or go.
One of the leading causes of 
the migrant and refugee crisis,
the largest since the Second
World War, is armed conflict and
violence. An estimated 250 million
children live in countries or areas
affected by conflict.
As part of the inter-agency model
of ‘cluster coordination’ in emergency situations, UNICEF led child protection efforts in 60 crises in 2016,
and served as the cluster lead for
gender-based violence in 12 emergency situations. Together with
partners, UNICEF protection teams

UNICEF collaborates with
a range of global partners,
including the Global Social
Service Workforce Alliance,
to strengthen national child
protection systems. During
2016, the organization advanced
strategic partnerships on
various child protection issues
in both humanitarian and
non-humanitarian situations.
On issues of violence, for
example, UNICEF worked
with the Global Partnership to
End Violence against Children.
On birth registration and
statelessness, it worked with the
Coalition on Every Child’s Right
to a Nationality, which it co-led
with the Office of the United
Nations High Commissioner for
Refugees. And on coordination
and standard setting for child
protection in all humanitarian
contexts, UNICEF was active in
the Alliance for Child Protection
in Humanitarian Action.
In a year marked by a massive
global migrant and refugee crisis,
UNICEF strengthened partnerships on migration with the
United Nations refugee agency,
the International Organization
for Migration (IOM) and UNICEF
National Committees in
migrant and refugee destination
countries. It also took part in an
anti-trafficking partnership with
IOM and the United Nations
Office on Drugs and Crime.

On a sunny morning in northwestern Cambodia, near the

One of the children – Savy

been staying with Goutte d’eau
for a year. Child traffickers took
her from her home when she was
7 years old. She was born with a
physical disability that prevented
her from walking easily, and the
traffickers took advantage of that,
forcing her to beg on the streets
of Bangkok for five years.

northward, seeking refuge
from gang violence and
poverty. UNICEF asserts that
they should not be detained,
except as a last resort, and
should have access to health
care and other essential
services.

In December, UNICEF released 
a video featuring Goodwill
Ambassador David Beckham as
part of the End Violence Against

collaboration with UNICEF UK,
the video was viewed online
more than 18 million times.
UNICEF worked with 124 countries
during the year to prevent and
respond to violence against children
by – among other objectives –
strengthening the justice sector and
law enforcement, and supporting
child protection practitioners
(including social workers, teachers
and health workers). In addition,
UNICEF backed the expansion of
much-needed services to children
affected by violence and bolstered
the ability of communities and
children themselves to identify risks
and report violations.
At the global level, UNICEF offered
technical assistance for INSPIRE:
Seven Strategies for Ending
Violence Against Children. The
World Health Organization, UNICEF
and other partners developed
this multi-sectoral programme
guide promoted by the Global
Partnership on Ending Violence
Against Children.

Safeguarding children’s rights
UNICEF has long supported free,
universal birth registration to safeguard
children’s rights and protect them from
violations. In 2016, UNICEF extended
its country-level support for birth registration by 30 per cent over 2015 levels.
The year also saw further progress in
reaching girls and boys at risk of, or
withdrawn from, child labour. UNICEF
supported child labour interventions
to assist approximately 7.5 million
children worldwide.
Also in 2016, UNICEF continued working with the United Nations Population
Fund (UNFPA) towards eliminating
female genital mutilation/cutting
(FGM/C). This focused on enhancing the
policy environment to end FGM/C, expanding the availability and use of quality services for victims, and addressing
social norms behind the practice. More
than 2,900 communities in 16 countries
declared the abandonment of FGM/C, as
did 10,080 families in Egypt. Worldwide,
approximately 8.5 million people now
live in communities covered by such
declarations.
UNICEF supported initiatives to end
child marriage in 42 countries in 2016.
In 12 of those countries, UNFPA
and UNICEF launched the Global
Programme to Accelerate Action to
End Child Marriage, which targets
adolescent girls at risk of – or already
in – early marriages.

Protection online
An area of growing concern for UNICEF is the abuse and exploitation of children
online. Through surveys, data collection and initiatives such as the Global Kids
Online partnership, researchers are investigating how the estimated 1 billion
children and adolescents who use the Internet navigate their digital world.
A 2016 global opinion poll of more than 10,000 18-year-olds from 25 countries
found that over 80 per cent of them believe children are at risk of being sexually abused or manipulated online. UNICEF is helping governments, civil society
and the private sector to implement strategies and programmes to better
protect children in a digital world, while still allowing them to benefit from
information and communication technologies.

Children 2016, progress towards all
of the 2030 global goals will be made
faster and more cost-effectively
through equity-focused approaches

Expanding social protection

Global efforts to narrow
the gaps

in extending cash transfers to the
most vulnerable families.

Poverty is not limited to children
living in the most deprived
areas of the world. In fact, most
children living in poverty are in
middle-income countries.

Globally, 179 million children
benefitted from cash transfers
in 2016 – 24 million more than in
2015. UNICEF also supported social
protection measures for the poorest
and most vulnerable populations in
fragile and conflict-prone countries.
Emergency-related direct benefit
payments reached US$51.2 million
for the year.

In a UNICEF report card released in
2016, high-income countries were
graded on child well-being. The
report examined gaps in projected
health, education and life satisfaction to present an overview of
persistent inequality.
UNICEF presented a set of recommendations for high-income countries that were not so different from
the solutions offered for low-income
countries: Set policies that prevent
the poorest households from falling
further behind; offer equitable
public financing and child-focused
budgeting; and reduce gaps in
educational achievement.

Social protection
programmes
Social protection systems keep millions of people out of poverty worldwide and make a positive impact
on children’s lives across a range
of indicators. Cash transfers for
social protection, in particular, work
by putting more money into the
hands of the poorest households,
strengthening local markets and creating a stream of social benefits.

UNICEF worked with several
governments in 2016 to increase
such public investments in children.
Thailand expanded its child-support
grant programme to benefit
children up to 3 years of age, for
instance. Madagascar launched
its first national cash transfer programme, targeting 117,000 children
in 39,000 households. And

Leaving no one behind
in emergencies
In May 2016, UNICEF and partners
secured a commitment by governments at the World Humanitarian
Summit to address emergency
preparedness and prevention within
their social protection systems.
Under a ‘grand bargain’ concluded
at the summit, participants supported the increased use of cash
assistance in emergency response,
together with expanded efforts
by governments and development
partners, to strengthen social
protection systems.
Under the bargain, local communities should gain greater control over
preparing for, responding to and
recovering from emergencies.
At the national level, UNICEF
worked with 49 countries in 2016
to include emergency prevention,
preparedness and response in their
social protection systems – and
with 56 countries to improve accountability to affected populations.
With such support, countries are
increasingly incorporating disaster
and conflict risks into their planning
and monitoring systems.

-----------------------Page 54 End-----------------------

Protecting migrants
and refugees
One of the biggest challenges for
governments in this era of escalating migration is ensuring that
people on the move are extended
the same protections as the citizens
of the host countries. UNICEF continuously supports the integration
of internally displaced persons,
refugees and returnees into existing
social protection systems.
Ongoing humanitarian crises in
2016 continued to fuel large-scale
displacement, with serious consequences for children and families.

Jordan, another major host
country for refugees, expanded
its cash transfer programme to
cover 56,000 girls and boys from
15,500 refugee families. Ninety-five
per cent of the families said they
were in a better position to pay their
child-related expenses because of
the grants.

Empowerment of women
and girls

#EndFGM.
A UNICEF report published
in February finds that at
least 200 million girls and
women alive today have
undergone female genital
mutilation/cutting. On
the International Day of
Zero Tolerance for Female
Genital Mutilation, UNICEF
and the United Nations
Population Fund reaffirm
their commitment to end
the practice by 2030.

Gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls are
firmly enshrined in the global goals
adopted by United Nations Member
States in 2015, and in UNICEF’s
own Gender Action Plan for 2014
through 2017.
In 2016, UNICEF continued to
emphasize women’s and girls’
equality and empowerment in all of
its operations, with notable progress
in the health and education sectors.
UNICEF Country Offices evaluated
their programme results with an eye
towards reducing the inequities that
vulnerable and marginalized women
and children face – especially those
living in poor communities, rural
areas and urban slums.
At the national, subnational and local
levels, UNICEF supported actions
to reduce child marriage and other
harmful practices such as female
genital cutting. The organization
worked to expand services for

marginalized adolescent girls and
championed governments’ inclusion
of more women in policy-making
and programming. UNICEF also
facilitated ministerial reviews
to ensure that women and girls
were equitably considered in
governmental decisions and that
they benefitted fairly from publicly
provided social services.

Focus on adolescent health
In 2016, UNICEF supported
91 countries in making health care
for adolescent girls a top priority
in their national budgets. Country
Offices provided evidence and
technical assistance, and promoted
policy debates, advocating gender
equity as a key element for the
success of adolescent health programmes and strategies.
Because HIV/AIDS is
now a greater risk for
adolescent girls than for boys,
UNICEF also encouraged
UNAIDS priority countries

-----------------------Page 56 End-----------------------

to review their HIV policies in
order to devise differentiated
responses and new monitoring
and evaluation tools specifi­
cally targeting girls. UNICEF
played a leadership role in
expanding access to treatment for
pregnant women living with HIV
in 22 priority countries.

The thrust of UNICEF’s agenda for girls’
education involves expanding their opportunities from primary into secondary
education. One third of all countries
worldwide recognized secondary
schooling for girls as an education
priority in 2016 and included it in their
national budgets – up from 27 per cent
in 2015. To further advance gender
equality, UNICEF is helping 12 target
countries accelerate educational services for marginalized adolescent girls.
In Tajikistan, adolescent girls in
UNICEF-supported secondary schools
have formed peer groups to resist
socio-cultural barriers and stay in
school. In Afghanistan, the Girls’
Access to Teacher Education project,
backed by UNICEF, enrolled 718 girl
students in teacher education in 2016
and gave them support in the form of
scholarships and mentoring.

In the public sector,
Luxembourg – a longtime
UNICEF supporter and one
of the first contributors to
its Gender Thematic Fund –
continued to be a strong
advocate for gender equality in
the international arena in 2016.
This advocacy was consistent
with the government’s past
support for the rights of girls
and women, including the
successful adoption of a gender
action plan by the Council of
the European Union when
Luxembourg held the council’s
presidency in 2015.

Batula Sid Barakow has been
working as a traditional birth
attendant for a quarter-century.
Because of her experience and
reputation, many families have
asked her to carry out female
genital mutilation/cutting (FGM/C)
on their daughters.
This practice is deeply rooted
in Somalia, which has one of the
world’s highest rates of FGM/C.
“Fathers believed their daughters
won’t be married if they’re not
cut,” Batula recalled in December
2016. “Mothers and grandmothers
were the ones who brought the
girls to me, so that they can check
the virginity of their daughters,”
she said.
Although she conducted the
procedure many times, Batula
ultimately decided it was wrong. In
fact, she became an activist against
cutting. This turnabout resulted
from a workshop she attended
in Mogadishu. Held by the

UNICEF | ANNUAL REPORT 2016

Community Care Programme, the
workshop was part of UNICEF’s
work with local partners in Somalia
to educate communities about
gender-based violence and how
to prevent it.
For 15 weeks, participants in
the programme built awareness
about human rights, tolerance and
justice. Through dialogue and discussion led by trained community
members, they arrived at some
solutions to the myriad problems of
violence against women and girls.
UNICEF and partners then helped
them translate these solutions into
concrete action.
In Batula’s case, that meant
ending her involvement with genital mutilation and urging others to
do the same. “As a mother, it really
pains me to see women suffering
because of my past mistakes,” she
said. “I will make sure that none of
my granddaughters will go through
such pain.”

-----------------------Page 58 End-----------------------

Gender dimensions of
water and sanitation
UNICEF and partners focus on
dignity, safety and health for girls
and women by advocating better
menstrual hygiene management
in humanitarian crisis response, as
well as in school strategies for improved water, sanitation and hygiene
(WASH).
As a result of these efforts,
30 countries adopted menstrual
hygiene targets in their schools
in 2016, while 1.3 million girls
in 7,183 schools gained access to
WASH facilities. Such interventions are pivotal to girls’ ability to
complete their education. At the
same time, 3.2 million women
and girls benefitted from improved
facilities supported by UNICEF
in emergency settings.

Ending child marriage
While girls face disproportionate
challenges globally, socio-cultural
practices like child marriage
exacerbate gender inequities.
Millions of underage girls are forced
into marriage every year. A key
cross-sectoral priority of UNICEF’s
gender plan is ending child marriage
wherever it occurs.

@UNICEF:
ADVOCACY IN 2016

To that end, UNICEF supported
community outreach and advocacy
efforts aimed at eliminating child
marriage in 12 target countries
during 2016, reaching 1.7 million
people. In the course of the year,
22 countries adopted national plans
to end the practice.

#DayOfTheGirl.
On the International Day of
the Girl in October, UNICEF
and partners point out that
investing in progress for
the world’s 1.1 billion girls
under age 18 – and improving
their health, education and
safety – is good not only for
them but also for society
at large. However, gaps in
disaggregated data on girls
and young women constrain
many countries’ capacity to
support them.

UNICEF’s communication tools,
particularly in the digital realm,
also proved effective in the fight
against early marriage. In March
2016, a UNICEF video on the
topic went viral, garnering more
than 31 million views online and
widely sharing the message that
early marriage is a serious violation
of a child’s rights.

Mobile health apps

In South Africa, UNICEF
supports the scale-up of
MomConnect, an SMS-based
programme providing vital information to improve health-care
access, coverage and quality
for mothers and their children.
As part of UNICEF’s RapidPro
mobile services platform,
MomConnect enhances the ability of female health workers to
access information electronically
and answer incoming health queries from women with prepared,
accurate responses. A mobile
health app to improve quality of
care provided by midwives is
launched as well.

Staying the course
Throughout 2016, UNICEF continued expanding its internal capacity to
address gender issues at the headquarters, regional and country levels.
Gender priorities were embedded in human resources, programme planning,
results monitoring and other core systems, and these efforts will be
maintained over the long term.
As the organization’s Gender Action Plan approached its final full year of
implementation, UNICEF channelled resources to take gender programming
to scale and demonstrate results. To build on the positive impact achieved to
date, the plan requires staying the course – not only through 2017 but also in
the ensuing years.

Throughout 2016 – a historically difficult and dangerous year for

technical capacity and ingenuity necessary to deliver critical supplies
and integrated services where and when they were needed most.
Achieving significant savings through market influence and strategic
focus, UNICEF maintained its reputation as the lead agency in
delivering cost-effective, high-quality supplies for vulnerable
children and families.
Rapid delivery
in emergencies
Although UNICEF procures most
of its supplies and services for
ongoing programmes, humanitarian
situations test its capacity to deliver
supplies quickly and effectively. For
all rapid-onset emergencies in 2016,
UNICEF made initial deliveries ready
for pick-up within 48 hours and
supplies arrived at entry points in
receiving countries within 72 hours.

In February, the UNICEF
Innovation Fund invites
technology start-ups to apply
for support in developing new
approaches to the pressing
problems of vulnerable children
in low- and middle-income
countries. The Fund focuses on
products and applications geared
towards improved learning and
youth participation; real-time
data on children’s well-being;
and increased youth access to
services and information.

In total, UNICEF procured more
than US$379 million worth
of supplies with emergency
funds – including supplies to
help address major crises in the
Central African Republic, Iraq,
South Sudan, the Syrian Arab
Republic and Yemen. In addition,
UNICEF dispatched emergency
nutrition supplies and polio
vaccines to Nigeria; essential
supplies for households affected
by Hurricane Matthew in Haiti and
by a 7.8 magnitude earthquake in
Ecuador; urgently needed yellow
fever vaccine to Angola and the
Democratic Republic of the Congo;
and critical support for child
refugees and migrants in Europe.
Freight forwarders and partners
supported the successful transport
and distribution of supplies procured
by UNICEF. Free cargo space
provided by the UPS Foundation
for airlifts to Ecuador, Haiti and
South Sudan – and by Panalpina
Air Freight for supply delivery
to Chad – supplemented the
emergency response.

Safe water and sanitation
Amidst increasing demand in
vulnerable communities, UNICEF
procured US$108.2 million in
water, sanitation and hygiene
supplies in 2016. Among many
other items, these supplies
included nearly 1.5 billion water
purification tablets, and flocculation
and chlorination sachets capable
of treating 35 billion litres of water,
as well as more than 1 million
hygiene kits.
Meanwhile, with an eye on environmentally sustainable solutions,
UNICEF conducted a global review
of the procurement and use of
solar-powered water pumps. The
review confirmed the versatility and
efficacy of these technologies.

UNICEF | ANNUAL REPORT 2016

Supplies for child and
maternal health
Even as it responds to emergencies,
UNICEF fast-tracks the procurement
of life-saving vaccines and other
health supplies and services around
the world. Total health-related procurement amounted to US$2.2 billion in 2016.
More than half of the total, or
US$1.6 billion, was for vaccine
procurement. That translates
into 2.5 billion vaccine doses,
reaching 45 per cent of the world’s
children under age 5. Together
with Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance,
and the Bill & Melinda Gates
Foundation, UNICEF also used its
leverage to halve the price of pentavalent vaccine – protecting young
children against five deadly but
preventable diseases.
Such price reductions provide
savings for donors who fund
immunization in the poorest
countries, and for governments
of lower-middle-income countries
that self-finance their vaccine
procurement. In 2016, the total
amount of savings reached
US$588 million.
In addition, UNICEF continued to
offer market leadership through
international consultations with
vaccine manufacturers and partners,
including a consultation on diagnostic
tools and development of a vaccine
for the Zika virus.
Other health supplies procured
by UNICEF included 691.3 million
safe-injection syringes for
immunization, 41.3 million
insecticide-treated nets to protect
children and families against
malaria, and US$160.6 million in
pharmaceuticals. The latter amount
included US$49.5 million for
antiretroviral medicines to prevent
and treat HIV and AIDS.

-----------------------Page 62 End-----------------------

Child nutrition and
therapeutic feeding
UNICEF procured a total of US$151 million in nutrition-related supplies in 2016,
while increasing local procurement of
ready-to-use therapeutic food (RUTF)
for the children most in need.
Localized sourcing reduces inequality
and promotes economic development in low- and middle-income
countries – not only in terms of
nutrition supplies but also in all
other programme sectors.
Fifteen years ago, for example,
the world’s supply of RUTF came
from a single European manufacturer. UNICEF worked with partners
and local manufacturers to establish a wider supply source in countries
with high rates of child malnutrition.
In 2016, 18 manufacturers provided
UNICEF with 33,330 tonnes of RUTF,
56 per cent of which originated from
suppliers in programme countries.

In the education sector, UNICEF
procured US$83.8 million worth of
supplies in 2016. Among other items,
it delivered nearly 119,000 education
kits (comprising kits for recreation
and early childhood development,
plus standard and country-specific
classroom kits). The kits were
shipped to 63 countries.
And UNICEF’s commitment to
inclusion was reflected by the
addition of accessibility-friendly
items – such as magnifying glasses,
inflatable play balls with bells
inside, and braille materials – to its
education kits.
UNICEF supplied numerous
school construction and rehabilitation projects as well. In fact,
UNICEF-supported construction
in all programme areas – from
education to child protection,
health, nutrition, and water and
sanitation – experienced record
growth in 2016. Most construction
projects took place in countries
experiencing emergencies, or
in post-conflict environments.

Flexible,
predictable funding

#EarlyMomentsMatter.
In October, The Lancet
publishes a commentary by
UNICEF, the World Health
Organization and the World
Bank Group to introduce
a special issue on early
childhood development.
The commentary notes that
an estimated 250 million
children under age 5 in lowincome and middle-income
countries risk falling behind
due to adversities in their
formative years.

From a budgetary standpoint,
UNICEF’s revenue from all sources
is divided into Regular Resources,
which are unrestricted, and Other
Resources, which are limited to
specific programmes and themes.
In 2016, Regular Resources stood
at 27 per cent as a proportion of
UNICEF’s total revenue. This represented an increase of 4 per cent
over 2015 and, it is hoped, indicates
an upward trend for the future.

64

UNICEF | ANNUAL REPORT 2016

Because they are not earmarked,
Regular Resources allow UNICEF
to respond quickly to emerging
challenges and invest in innovative
solutions. Such flexibility helps
break down the often-limiting

barrier created by separate
financing streams for humanitarian action and development
work. A flexible, predictable funding
base, provided through Regular
Resources, helps the organization
achieve results for the most
vulnerable children.
The Government of Sweden
doubled its contribution of this
type of funding in 2016, making
it the second-largest contributor
to Regular Resources, behind the
United States. The third-largest
contributor came from the family
of UNICEF National Committees,
specifically Japan – a testament
to the private-sector support that
UNICEF’s mandate generates.

-----------------------Page 66 End-----------------------

Support for
humanitarian action
The scale and complexity of the
crises facing the world’s children
today underscore the need
for a broad resource base.
In 2016, UNICEF’s resource
partners generously responded to
multiple emergencies by providing
US$1.6 billion in total revenue for
humanitarian action. The United
States continued to rank as the largest government donor to UNICEF
humanitarian operations, while the
Netherlands was the largest government to do so through highly flexible
thematic funding.

@UNICEF:

provide the foundation for
its operations.
UNICEF relies on United
States leadership in the
exchange of technical ideas and
knowledge as well. It works
closely with technical partners
in government agencies such
as USAID and the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention.
The people and Government
of Sweden are also longtime
champions for children,
engaging with UNICEF across
a wide range of activities – from
overall development cooperation
to humanitarian action. In an
unprecedented move, Sweden
doubled its contribution to
UNICEF’s Regular Resources
in 2016, making it the second
largest government resource
partner in terms of those
unrestricted funds.

Private-sector resources
In the private sector, UNICEF
works closely with multinational
corporations, national companies
and small- to medium-sized
businesses to identify, design and
implement alliances that leverage
the strengths of business on
behalf of the world’s children. In
turn, UNICEF helps companies
strengthen their commitment to
the communities in which they
operate, and achieve greater
social responsibility.

In addition to earmarked resources
destined for emergencies in 2016,
UNICEF used its unrestricted
Regular Resources to support

humanitarian action. For example,
UNICEF’s Emergency Programme
Fund, a revolving loan facility,
released $26 million to 14 Country
Offices and three Regional Offices
to rapidly prevent or respond
to crises.

@UNICEF:

Support for the
world’s children
Sweden is a leader in thematic
funding for UNICEF, through
which the country gave
significantly to water, sanitation
and hygiene, child protection
and other programmes. Swedish
support has allowed UNICEF to
advance gender and disability
rights with regard to water and
sanitation, and to respond to
humanitarian needs in countries
in crisis such as the Syrian
Arab Republic.
UNICEF and the World Bank
Group (WBG), meanwhile, have
committed to stronger and
more systematic collaboration
through the development of
a new Strategic Partnership
Framework. The partnership
focuses on investments in
early childhood development;
data, research and policy
work; and improved service
delivery and social protection
for every child – including
adolescents, and refugee
and migrant children.
UNICEF and WBG have
also reached a breakthrough
in leveraging resources from
the International Development
Association for operations in
fragile and crisis-affected states.
And WBG helped UNICEF
support country-level results in
immunization, health-system
strengthening and nutrition in
the Democratic Republic of
the Congo, Egypt, Haiti, Mali,
Nigeria and Yemen in 2016.

By working with UNICEF, companies support long-term programmes
and emergency relief efforts alike,
and help to advocate for issues that
are vital to children.
In 2016, UNICEF celebrated
anniversaries with two of its
best-known and longest running
private-sector partnerships.
Change for Good ® – supported by Aer Lingus, American
Airlines, All Nippon Airways,
Asiana Airlines, Cathay Pacific,
easyJet, Hainan Airlines, Japan
Airlines and QANTAS – has raised
US$150 million globally in 25 years
of operation. Meanwhile, Fútbol
Club Barcelona, a valued partner for
10 years, renewed its commitment
to UNICEF through 2020 and will
be providing €2 million annually to
the partnership.
UNICEF continued to raise
funds and awareness through its
34 National Committees, which
account for up to one third of overall
funding. Financial support also
came from greeting card and other
product sales carried out in partnership with Hallmark, Editor, Pictura
and Belarto.

Strengthening 
performance
To make the most of its resources,
UNICEF has adopted results-based
management practices driven
by its strategic objectives. It has
also focused persistently – and
successfully – on achieving
efficiency and transparency in
its processes. UNICEF ranked
third out of 46 major aid organizations worldwide in the 2016 Aid
Transparency Index.

UNICEF | ANNUAL REPORT 2016

As one of the largest buyers of
supplies for children, UNICEF saw
its largest savings to date through
market influence and targeted
procurement in 2016, with many
supplies provided locally. It partnered with other United Nations
agencies on most procurements
and continued working with them
to simplify and harmonize business
processes generally.
Using a mix of strategies to achieve
results, UNICEF maintained an
emphasis on building capacity
and generating relevant evidence
and data in all country-level operations. In the process, it supported
efforts by national governments
and the international community
to establish a credible baseline
for the Sustainable Development
Goals – with an emphasis on
child-focused data, disaggregated
by disability, migration status, urban
or rural location, household wealth
and other factors.
In terms of expenditures in
2016, UNICEF programmes in
sub-Saharan Africa accounted for
just over half of the total, consistent
with 2015. Least developed countries also accounted for about half
of the year’s expenses.
UNICEF extends its deepest
appreciation to all the partners
who provided financial resources
and other support in 2016. Their
generosity and commitment play
an indispensable part in reaching
the world’s most vulnerable and
disadvantaged children, wherever
they are.

For every child
Whoever she is.
Wherever he lives.
Every child deserves a childhood.
A future.
A fair chance.
That ’s why UNICEF is there.
For each and ever y child.
Working day in and day out.
In 190 countries and territories.
Reaching the hardest to reach.
The furthest from help.
The most left behind.
The most excluded.
It’s why we stay to the end.
And never give up.
