The Pacific Islands Forum

Vision
Our Pacific Vision is for a region of peace, harmony, security, social
inclusion, and prosperity, so that all Pacific people can lead free, healthy,
and productive lives.



Values
We value and depend upon the integrity of our vast ocean and our island
resources.

We treasure the diversity and heritage of the Pacific and seek an inclusive
future in which cultures, traditions and religious beliefs are valued,
honoured and developed.

We embrace good governance, the full observance of democratic values,
the rule of law, the defense and promotion of all human rights, gender
equality, and commitment to just societies.

We seek peaceful, safe, and stable communities and countries, ensuring
full security and wellbeing for the peoples of the Pacific.

We support full inclusivity, equity and equality for all people of the Pacific.

We strive for effective, open and honest relationships and inclusive and
enduring partnerships—based on mutual accountability and respect—
with each other, within our sub-regions, within our region, and beyond.

These Pacific regional values will guide all our policy-making and
implementation.

2016 was a watershed moment for the Pacific Islands
Forum, with the Forum Leaders’ at the 47th Pacific
Islands Forum deciding to accept French Polynesia

time in the history of the Forum that non-independent
territories have become full members. The decision is

PROMOTING INCLUSIVE REGIONALISM



In 2016, the Secretariat announced its second
call for submissions from the public on potential
priorities for regionalism. In response, the
Secretariat received 47 policy submissions from
NSAs and members of the public focused on a
range of issues including West Papua, Climate
Change, ICT, and the movement of people
throughout the region.                                   Inclusiveness is one of the

A regional CSO Forum was held in Suva in August
which saw 37 representatives from 15 countries
discuss issues including climate change, disaster
response, labour mobility, disability, sports, and
human rights in West Papua. A small group was
elected from this Forum to take the views of
CSOs to the Forum Troika when Leaders met for
the 47th Pacific Islands Forum, in FSM.

The subsequent CSO Dialogue with the Forum
TROIKA included the Prime Minster of Samoa,
and Presidents of Marshall Islands and FSM.
Senior Ministers from PNG and Palau were
also present. Further evidence of increased          Figure 3. CSO Dialogue with the Forum Troika which was held in Pohnpei,

ADVANCING FORUM PRIORITIES FOR REGIONALISM


Maximising sustainable economic returns on fisheries

  At the 2015 Pacific Islands Forum Leaders
Meeting, Leaders affirmed the central importance
of maximising the economic returns from the
region’s fisheries and for ensuring its sustainable
management. Leaders also endorsed the Regional
Roadmap for Sustainable Pacific Fisheries and
directed that increases in the economic returns

not increased significantly between 1999 and
2014, despite indications of increasing fishing
pressure at the national level. In response to the
report, Forum Leaders recognised that coastal
fisheries management received inadequate
attention at the national level, and they agreed
to expand their priority on fisheries to include
coastal fisheries, noting links to communities,
food security, health issues and in particular non-
communicable diseases. The Pacific Community
(SPC) was tasked with coordinating National
Fisheries Agencies, CROP agencies and regional
and national community groups, to strengthen
support and resourcing for coastal fisheries
management.

In 2016 under the Cervical Cancer Taskforce, the
Forum Secretariat commissioned the Fiji National
University to conduct a situation analysis on
the prevalence of cervical cancer in the region

Community, United Nations and the Asian
Development Bank. The survey established a
baseline for cervical cancer prevalence across
the region including mortality rates (see figure        From 2016, 9 countries in the

In 2016, only five Forum Island Countries (36%)
managed to include HPV vaccination into their
routine immunization programmes. Some
countries conducted pilot programmes but
were not able to continue due to the high costs
involved.

This now means that nine countries in the region
(64%) will be vaccinating girls against cervical
cancer in future.

Using ICT for Growth and Governance

In recognising the unprecedented economic
and educational opportunities provided by
Information Communication Technologies (ICT),
in 2015 Leaders tasked the Secretariat and the
University of the South Pacific to consider the
merit of a regional ICT advisory council.

In response, the CROP ICT working group
was expanded to incorporate additional key
stakeholders. The working group is now
developing a regional ICT strategy, which,
following the 2016 decision by Forum Leaders,
will be addressed at a ministerial level going
forward.

Finance Facility would amplify economic and
political gains by transforming national markets
into a combined regional market for financial
assets. Further work will be carried out by
the Forum Secretariat in 2017 to explore the
feasibility of the Facility.

The Forum Secretariat advocated for re-defining
how multilateral banks define ‘fragility’ so as to
be inclusive of climate change. The Secretariat
successfully assisted Pacific countries to raise
this matter at the Asia Development Bank Annual
Meeting, the IMF-World Bank Group (WBG)
annual meetings, and a UNDP-PIFS seminar on
financing for development.

These actions enabled Pacific countries to
secure high-level commitment from global
institutions to progress this matter in 2017.
Additionally, the WBG and the Forum Secretariat
have agreed to host a side-event at the 2017
FEMM for FICs Finance Ministers, Private
Sector and Civil Society Organisations (CSOs)
on WBG’s IDA allocation and progress on re-
defining fragility.                                       Figure 8. SG Taylor and Axel van Trotsenburg, Vice President of
