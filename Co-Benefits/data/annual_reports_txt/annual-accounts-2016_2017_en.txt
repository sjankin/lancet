FOREWORD

                               It is my pleasure to present the 2016 annual accounts of the European
                               Union. These accounts provide a complete overview of the finances of the
                               EU for 2016 – this includes information on the financial position of the
                               Union, how the budget has been implemented for the year, its contingent
                               liabilities, as well as the financial commitments and obligations that the
                               Union has undertaken. Reflecting the multiannual nature of the Union's
                               activities, the accounts include explanations of the key financial figures
                               and their evolution.

                               2016 was a year full of achievements but also challenges for the
                               European Union. The EU budget focused on strengthening economy,
                               boosting jobs and growth and investing in research. The European
                               economy and labour market conditions improved and unemployment in
                               the EU went down.

Less than a year and a half after its launch, the European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI),
the centrepiece of the Investment Plan for Europe, has already delivered tangible results. Active in all 28
Member States this Fund mobilized more than EUR 190 billion of investments by mid May 2017, which is
more than half of the target of EUR 315 billion set for mid-2018, contributing to the economic recovery.
At the end of 2016, the guarantee fund which covers the EFSI operations undertaken by the EIB group
had been provisioned by funds from the EU budget and totalled EUR 1 billion in these annual accounts.

Boosting jobs, growth and investment remains the overarching priority for the EU budget. The
Commission continues its efforts to strengthen EU's economic recovery and to invest in its youth and
jobseekers, as well as in start-ups and small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs). A good example is
the Loan Guarantee Facility under the ‘COSME’ programme (‘Competitiveness of enterprises and small
and medium-sized enterprises’) which continued to be very successful in 2016, also thanks to the
additional risk-bearing capacity from EFSI. At the end of 2016, more than 143 000 small and medium
sized enterprises in 21 countries have already received financing of more than EUR 5.5 billion with the
support of the COSME programme.

The research and innovation programme Horizon 2020 is key for building an innovation and knowledge-
based economy and society within the EU. It succeeded in reaching 49 000 participations and grant
agreements were signed for a total amount of EUR 20.5 billion. Over 21 % of all participations were
SMEs. The increase of the Horizon 2020 activities is evidenced by the almost 40 % increase in the
Horizon 2020 guarantee instruments included in these accounts when compared to last year.

Following the declaration of Initial Services in 2016, the Galileo-programme, setting up Europe's own
global satellite navigation system, transitioned from the deployment to the exploitation phase in 2016.
The value of the operational Galileo satellites and ground infrastructure included in these accounts
amounted to EUR 2 billion at the end of 2016. The implementation of projects under Horizon 2020
encouraged the development of new Galileo applications. These projects have already led to 13
innovations being brought to the market, 5 patents, 34 advanced prototypes, two products on the market
and 223 published scientific papers. The Global Navigation Satellite System market is expected to grow
from 5.8 billion devices in use in 2017 to an estimated 8 billion by 2020.

The Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) for Transport with its objective to facilitate infrastructure
projects’ access to financing in the sectors of transport, telecommunications and energy contributed to
the 64 km long Brenner Base Rail tunnel which will be the longest high capacity rail tunnel in the world.
The CEF debt instrument included in the accounts offers risk-sharing for debt financing in the form of
senior and subordinated debt or guarantee as well as support for project bonds.

In 2016 the European response to new challenges emerging from the shifting geopolitical situation
continued. The EU budget provided support to Member States in properly managing migration flows,
addressing the root causes of migration and safeguarding the Schengen area. The implementation of
Member States' national programmes under the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund and the Internal
Security Fund gathered pace in 2016.
-----------------------Page 7 End-----------------------

The Commission also established the Facility for refugees in Turkey which became operational on
17 February 2016 and for which the accounts include EUR 630 million of Member States contributions
cashed in 2016. This enabled the Commission, among other initiatives, to launch an innovative
programme called the Emergency Social Safety Net, aiming at assisting up to one million of the most
vulnerable refugees in Turkey with regular cash allocations. This is an example of an increasing use of
assistance from the EU budget as an efficient and effective way of getting aid to people in emergency
situations.

In June 2016, the Commission proposed a new Partnership Framework with third countries under the
European Agenda on Migration. The Framework is a European approach to deepening cooperation with
countries of origin, transit and destination of migratory flows. It is supported by most of the 'Global
Europe' programmes of the budget, and also by the relevant EU Trust Funds, in particular the Trust
Fund for Syria, which is included in the annual accounts. Adequate funding for the Partnership
Framework is essential to be able to intensify cooperation with the priority partner countries and continue
the efforts on the Central Mediterranean migration route.

Other global challenges, such as addressing climate change, continued to be a priority of the
EU budget. In 2016 the total contribution to climate mainstreaming was estimated at 20.9 %, in line
with the target set for the current MFF period 2014-2020.

In budgetary terms, the European Structural and Investment Funds and the Common Agricultural
Policy remain the main investment instruments of the EU. The EU budget spent EUR 57.4 billion in 2016
on farming and rural development and, despite earlier delays in the start-up and implementation of the
current MFF, EUR 37.8 billion was spent on the Economic, Social and Territorial Cohesion.



The Commission has launched a debate on the future and priorities of an EU with 27 Member States. We
will continue working together to build a more prosperous, competitive and secure future.

                                                                                   Günther H. Oettinger

EUROPEAN UNION POLITICAL
FRAMEWORK, GOVERNANCE AND
ACCOUNTABILITY

The European Union (EU) is a union on which its 281 European countries (the Member States) confer
competences to attain objectives they have in common. The Union is founded on the values of respect for
human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights, including the
rights of persons belonging to minorities. These values are common to the Member States in a society in
which pluralism, non-discrimination, tolerance, justice, solidarity and equality between women and men
prevail.




1.          POLITICAL FRAMEWORK
                            The overarching objectives and principles that guide the Union and the
                            European Institutions are defined in the Treaties. The Union and the EU
      EU Treaties           institutions may only act within the limits of the competences conferred by
                            the Treaties so as to attain the objectives set out therein and must do this in
                            accordance with the principles2 of subsidiarity and proportionality.
To attain its objectives and carry out its policies, the Union provides itself with the necessary financial
means. The Commission is responsible for implementing the objectives in cooperation with the Member
States and in accordance with the principle of sound financial management.

The EU pursues the objectives established in the Treaty with a number of tools, one of which is the EU
budget. Others are, for example, proposing legislation or pursuing policy strategies.



                           The Europe 2020 strategy agreed in 2010 by the Heads of State or
                           Government of EU Member States defines a 10 year jobs and growth strategy
      Europe 2020
                           at EU level for the EU3. The strategy put forward three mutually reinforcing
         strategy
                           priorities of smart, sustainable and inclusive growth with five EU headline
                           targets. Its success depends on all the actors of the Union, acting collectively.
The EU budget is only one of the EU levers contributing to the delivery of the Europe 2020 objectives. A
wide range of actions at national, EU and international levels are being mobilised to deliver concrete
results on the Europe 2020 strategy.


                                 The Commission's political priorities are defined in the political guidelines set
    Commission political         by the President of the Commission, providing a roadmap for the
        priorities               Commission's action that is fully consistent and compatible with Europe 2020
                                 as Europe's long-term growth strategy.

     On 29 March 2017, the United Kingdom (UK) gave formal notification of its intention to leave the EU thus triggering
     the withdrawal process under Article 50 of the Treaty on the European Union.
2
     Under the principle of subsidiarity, the Union shall act only if and in so far as the objectives of the proposed action
     cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States but can rather, by reason of the scale or effects, be better
     achieved at Union level. Under the principle of proportionality, the content and form of Union action shall not
     exceed what is necessary to achieve the objectives of the Treaties. See Article 5 of the TFEU.

                  Monetary Union (EMU).




The policies supported by the EU budget are implemented in accordance with the multiannual financial
framework (MFF).

                              The MFF translates the EU’s political priorities into financial terms for at least
                              5 years. It sets maximum annual amounts (ceilings) for EU expenditure as a
            MFF               whole and for the main categories of expenditure (headings). The sum of the
                              ceilings of all headings gives the total ceiling of commitment appropriations.

The MFF supports EU actions to deliver on the objectives of EU policies over a period long enough to be
effective and to provide a coherent long-term vision for its beneficiaries and co-financing national
authorities. The 2014-2020 MFF and its constituent programmes, which set maximum budget
commitments for the period at EUR 960 billion and payments at EUR 908 billion (at 2011 prices), have
been designed with a strong European logic and focus on added value to help deliver on the commonly
agreed goals of the Europe 2020 jobs and growth strategy.

The MFF is agreed by unanimity indicating the agreement of all Member States to the objectives and
spending. The EU budget finances a wide range of policies and programmes throughout the EU. In
accordance with the priorities set by the European Parliament and the Council in the MFF, the
Commission implements spending programmes, activities and projects. Under the main spending area of
the European Structural and Investment Funds (ESIF), the EU legally commits to implementing these
actions by adopting the operational programmes.

                           The MFF is complemented with the interinstitutional agreement on budgetary
     Interinstitutional    discipline on cooperation in budgetary matters and on sound financial
        agreement          management4 which is a political agreement between the European
                           Parliament, the Council and the Commission. The purpose of this agreement,
adopted in 2013 in accordance with Article 295 of the TFEU, is to implement budgetary discipline and
improve the functioning of the annual budgetary procedure and cooperation between the institutions on
budgetary matters as well as to ensure sound financial management.

     Interinstitutional Agreement of 2 December 2013 between the European Parliament, the Council and the
     Commission on budgetary discipline, on cooperation in budgetary matters and on sound financial management

                                 Annual accounts of the European Union 2016

                           The annual budget is prepared by the Commission and usually agreed by mid-
                           December by the European Parliament and the Council, based on the
     Annual budget         procedure of Art. 314 TFEU. According to the principle of budget equilibrium,
                           total revenue must equal total expenditure (payment appropriations) for a
                           given financial year.

The main source of funding of the EU are own resources revenues which are complemented by other
revenues. There are three types of own resources: traditional own resources (such as custom duties and
sugar levies), the own resource based on value added tax (VAT) and the own resource based on gross
national income (GNI). Other revenues arising from the activities of the EU (e.g. competition fines)
normally represent less than 10 % of total revenue. The overall amount of own resources needed to
finance the budget is determined by total expenditure less other revenue. The total amount of own
resources cannot exceed 1.23 % of the sum of gross national income (GNI) of the Member States.

The EU's operational expenditure covers the various headings of the MFF and takes different forms,
depending on how the money is paid out and managed. The EU budget is implemented in three
management modes:

       Shared management: under this method of budget implementation tasks are delegated to
       Member States. About 80 % of the expenditure falls under this management mode covering such
       areas as agricultural spending and structural actions.

       Direct management: this is where the budget is implemented directly by the Commission
       services.

       Indirect management: this refers to cases where the Commission confers tasks of implementation
       of the budget to bodies of EU law or national law, such as the EU agencies or international
       organisations.



                           The Financial Regulation (FR) applicable to the general budget is a central act

2.        GOVERNANCE AND ACCOUNTABILITY IN THE EU

2.1.      INSTITUTIONAL STRUCTURE

The organisational governance of the EU consists of institutions, agencies and other EU bodies which are
listed in note 9 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements. The main institutions, in the sense
of being responsible for drafting policies and taking decisions, are the European Parliament, the European
Council, the Council and the Commission.

The Commission is the executive of the EU and promotes its general interest. It does this by proposing
legislation; implementing EU policies; overseeing the correct implementation of the Treaties and
European law; managing the EU budget; and by representing the Union outside Europe.

The Commission's internal functioning is based on a number of key principles underpinning good
governance: clear roles and responsibilities, a strong commitment to performance management and
compliance with the legal framework, clear accountability mechanisms, a high quality and inclusive
regulatory framework, openness and transparency, and high standards of ethical behaviour.

2.2.      THE COMMISSION'S GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE

The European Commission has a unique governance system, with a clear distinction between political and
administrative oversight structures and well-defined lines of responsibility and financial accountability.
The system is based on the Treaties and the structure has evolved to adapt to a changing environment
and to remain in line with best practice as set out in relevant international standards5.

       The College of Commissioners assumes collegial political responsibility for the work of the
        Commission. Operational implementation of the budget is delegated to Directors-General and
        Heads of Service who lead the administrative structure of the Commission6.

       The College delegates financial management tasks to the Directors-General or Heads of Service
        who thereby become Authorising Officers by Delegation (AOD). These tasks can further be
        delegated to Directors, Heads of Unit and others, who thereby become Authorising Officers by
        Sub-Delegation. The responsibility of the Authorising Officers covers the entire management
        process, from determining what needs to be done to achieve the policy objectives set by the
        institution to managing the activities launched from both an operational and budgetary
        standpoint.

In the Commission, the roles and responsibilities in financial management are thus clearly defined and
applied. This is a decentralised approach with clear responsibilities with the aim of creating an
administrative culture that encourages civil servants to take responsibility for activities over which they
have control and to give them control over the activities for which they are responsible.

Within the context of the Commission's Strategic Planning and Programming cycle, each authorising
officer is required to prepare an "annual activity report" (AAR) on the activities and policy achievements
and results of the year where he/she declares that resources have been used based on the principles of
sound financial management and that he has set in place control procedures which provide the necessary
guarantee concerning the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions. At Commission's level
these results are adopted and published in an aggregated form in the Annual Management and
Performance Report for the budget and sent to the European Parliament and the Council and is the main
instrument through which the College of Commissioners takes political responsibility for the management
of the budget.

The Accounting Officer of the Commission is centrally responsible for the treasury management, recovery
procedures, laying down accounting rules based on International Public Sector Accounting Standards and
methods, validating accounting systems and the preparation of the Commission's and consolidated
annual accounts of the EU. Furthermore, the Accounting Officer is required to sign the annual accounts
declaring that they present fairly, in all material aspects, the financial position, the results of the
operations and the cash flows. The Accounting Officer is an independent function and bears a major
responsibility as regards financial reporting in the Commission. The Internal Auditor of the Commission is
likewise a centralised and independent function.

The Corporate Management Board plays a role in the corporate governance of the Commission by
providing oversight and strategic orientations on major corporate management issues, including in
relation to the management of financial and human resources. Chaired by the Secretary-General, it
brings together on a regular basis Directors-General and Cabinets responsible for budget, human
resources and IT to ensure that the necessary organisational and technical structures are in place in the
Commission to deliver on the political priorities of the President in an efficient and effective manner.




2.3.      ROBUST PERFORMANCE FRAMEWORK

Implementing robust performance frameworks is essential for ensuring a strong focus on results, EU
added value and sound management of EU programmes. The performance of the EU budget must
consider the multiplicity of objectives as well as the complementarity and mainstreaming of policies and

5
        E.g. internal control standards are based on the COSO 2013 Internal Control principles.
6
        As a result, the term 'European Commission' is used to denote both the institution – the College - formed by
        the Members of the Commission, and its administration managed by the Directors-General of its departments
        (and heads of other administrative structures such as services, offices and executive agencies).

programmes and the key role of the Member States in implementing the EU Budget. The Commission is
committed to ensuring that the EU budget achieves better outcomes for citizens and that supports the
political priorities. To ensure resources are allocated to priorities and that every action brings high
performance and added value, the Commission implements its EU Budget Focused on Results initiative.
Building on the 2014–2020 performance framework, it promotes a better balance between compliance
and performance. The 2014-2020 performance frameworks have been included as a new compulsory
element and as a key pillar of the increased result orientation of this programming period. It foresees the
establishment of clear and measureable objectives, indicators and targets as well as monitoring,
reporting and evaluation arrangements.

The Annual Management and Performance Report for the EU budget provides a comprehensive overview
on the performance, management and protection of the EU budget. It explains how the EU budget
supports the European Union’s political priorities, the results achieved with the EU budget, and the role
the Commission plays in ensuring and promoting the highest standards of budgetary and financial
management.




2.4.      FINANCIAL REPORTING

The main element of EU financial reporting is the Integrated Financial Reporting Package (IFRP) of the EU
which comprises the consolidated annual accounts of the EU and other reports accompanying the
accounts, i.e. the Annual Management and Performance Report for the budget and the report on the
follow-up to the discharge. The IFRP provides the public with a comprehensive view of the financial and
operational situation of the EU each year.

The consolidated annual accounts of the EU provide financial information on the activities of the
institutions, agencies and other bodies of the EU from both an accrual accounting and budgetary
perspective. These accounts do not comprise the annual accounts of Member States.

The consolidated annual accounts of the EU consist of two separate but linked parts:

       a)       the consolidated financial statements; and

       b)       the reports on implementation of the budget, which provide an aggregated record of
                budget implementation.

In addition, the consolidated annual accounts of the EU are accompanied by a Financial Statement
Discussion and Analysis (FSDA) which summarises significant changes and trends in the financial
statements and explains significant risks and uncertainties the EU has faced and needs to address in
future.

2.5.        CONTROLS

External audit
The European Court of Auditors (the Court) is the external auditor of the EU institutions (and bodies).
The Court's mission is to contribute to improving EU financial management, promote accountability and
transparency, and act as the independent guardian of the financial interests of the citizens of the EU. The
Court’s role as the EU’s independent external auditor is to check that EU funds are correctly accounted
for, are raised and spent in accordance with the relevant rules and regulations and have achieved value
for money.

The EU’s annual accounts and its resource management are audited by the Court, which, as part of its
activities, draws up for the EP and the Council:

(1)     an annual report on the activities financed from the general budget, detailing its observations on
        the annual accounts and underlying transactions;
(2)     an opinion, based on its audits and given in the annual report in the form of a statement of
        assurance, on (i) the reliability of the accounts and (ii) the legality and regularity of the
        underlying transactions involving both revenue collected and payments to final beneficiaries; and
(3)     special reports covering specific areas.


Discharge

The final step of a budget lifecycle is the discharge of the budget for a given financial year. A discharge is
given to the Commission and all other EU institutions and bodies. The discharge represents the political
aspect of the external control of budget implementation and is the decision by which the European
Parliament , acting on a Council recommendation, "releases" the Commission (and other EU bodies) from
its responsibility for management of a given budget by marking the end of that budget's existence. The
European Parliament is the discharge authority within the EU. This means that following the audit and
finalisation of the annual accounts it falls to the Council to recommend and then to the European
Parliament to give a discharge to the Commission and other EU bodies for implementing the EU budget
for a given financial year. This decision is based on an examination of the annual accounts, the
Commission's annual management and performance report for the budget, the annual report, the audit
opinion and special reports of the Court, and replies of the Commission to questions and further
information requests.

This discharge procedure may produce three outcomes: the granting, postponement or the refusal of the
discharge. Integral to the annual budgetary discharge procedure in the European Parliament are the
hearings with Commissioners who are questioned by the MEP's in the Budgetary Control Committee
regarding the policy areas under their responsibility. The final discharge report including specific
recommendations to the Commission for action is adopted in Plenary of the European Parliament. The
Council discharge recommendations are adopted by the Economic and Financial Affairs Council (ECOFIN).
Both, the European Parliament's discharge report as well as the Council discharge recommendations are
subject to an annual follow up report in which the Commission outlines the concrete actions it has taken
to implement the recommendations made.

                                  Annual accounts of the European Union 2016


1.        SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

1.1.      LEGAL BASIS AND ACCOUNTING RULES
The accounts of the EU are kept in accordance with Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012 of the
European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2012 on the financial rules applicable to the
general budget of the Union and repealing Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 (OJ L 298,
26 October 2012, p. 1) hereinafter referred to as the 'Financial Regulation' and Commission Delegated
Regulation (EU) No 1268/2012 of 29 October 2012 (OJ L 362, 31 December 2012, p. 1) laying down
detailed rules of application of this Financial Regulation.

In accordance with article 143 of the Financial Regulation, the EU prepares its financial statements on the
basis of accrual-based accounting rules that are based on International Public Sector Accounting
Standards (IPSAS). These accounting rules, adopted by the Accounting Officer of the Commission, have
to be applied by all the institutions and EU bodies falling within the scope of consolidation in order to
establish a uniform set of rules for accounting, valuation and presentation of the accounts with a view to
harmonising the process for drawing up the financial statements and consolidation.




1.2.      ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES
The objective of financial statements is to provide information about the financial position, performance
and cashflows of an entity that is useful to a wide range of users. For the EU as a public sector entity, the
objectives are more specifically to provide information useful for decision making, and to demonstrate the
accountability of the entity for the resources entrusted to it. It is with these goals in mind that the
present document has been drawn up.

The overall considerations (or accounting principles) to be followed when preparing the financial
statements are laid down in EU accounting rule 1 "Financial Statements" and are the same as those
described in IPSAS 1: fair presentation, accrual basis, going concern, consistency of presentation,
materiality, aggregation, offsetting and comparative information. The qualitative characteristics of
financial reporting according to article 144 of the Financial Regulation are relevance, reliability,
understandability and comparability.




1.3.      CONSOLIDATION
Scope of consolidation

The consolidated financial statements of the EU comprise all significant controlled entities (i.e. the EU
institutions (including the Commission) and the EU agencies), associates and joint ventures. The
complete list of consolidated entities can be found in note 9 of the EU financial statements. It now
comprises 52 controlled entities and 1 associate. Entities that fall under the consolidation scope, but
which are immaterial to the EU consolidated financial statements as a whole, need not be consolidated or
accounted for using equity method where to do so would result in excessive time or cost to the EU. Those
entities are referred to as 'Minor entities' and are separately listed in note 9. In 2016, 7 entities have
been classified as minor entities.

Controlled entities

The decision to include an entity in the scope of consolidation is based on the control concept. Controlled
entities are all entities for which the EU is exposed, or has right, to variable benefits from its involvement
and has the liability to affect the nature and amount of those benefits through its power over the other
entity. This power must be presently exercisable and must relate to the relevant activities of the entity.
Controlled entities are fully consolidated. The consolidation begins at the first date on which control
exists, and ends when such control no longer exists.

                                  Annual accounts of the European Union 2016

The most common indicators of control within the EU are: creation of the entity through founding treaties
or secondary legislation, financing of the entity from the EU budget, the existence of voting rights in the
governing bodies, audit by the European Court of Auditors and discharge by the European Parliament. An
individual assessment for each entity is made in order to decide whether one or all of the criteria listed
above are sufficient to result in control.

Under this approach, the EU's institutions (except the European Central Bank) and agencies (excluding
the agencies of the former 2nd pillar) are considered as under the exclusive control of the EU and are
therefore included in the consolidation scope. Furthermore the European Coal and Steel Community
(ECSC) in Liquidation is also considered as a controlled entity.

All material "inter-entity transactions and balances" between EU controlled entities are eliminated, while
unrealised gains and losses on such transactions are not material and so have not been eliminated.

Joint Arrangements

A joint arrangement is an agreement over which the EU and one or more parties have joint control. Joint
control is contractually agreed sharing of control over an arrangement, which exists only when decisions
about the relevant activities require the unanimous consent of parties sharing control. Joint agreements
can be either joint operations or joint ventures. In case a joint arrangement is structured through a
separate vehicle and parties to the joint arrangement have rights to the net assets of the arrangement,
this joint arrangement classifies as a joint venture. Participations in joint ventures are accounted for
using the equity method (see note 1.5.4). In case the parties have rights to the assets, and obligations
for the liabilities, related to the arrangement, this joint arrangement is classified as a joint operation. In
relation to its interest in joint operations, the EU recognises in its financial statements: its assets and
liabilities, revenue and expense, as well as its share of assets, liabilities, revenue and expense held or
incurred jointly.

Associates

Associates are entities over which the EU has, directly or indirectly, significant influence but not control.
It is presumed that significant influence exists if the EU holds directly or indirectly 20 % or more of the
voting rights. Participations in associates are accounted for using the equity method (see note 1.5.4).

Non-consolidated entities the funds of which are managed by the Commission

The funds of the Joint Sickness Insurance Scheme for staff of the EU, the European Development Fund
and the Participants Guarantee Fund are managed by the Commission on their behalf. However, since
these entities are not controlled by the EU, they are not consolidated in its financial statements.




1.4.      BASIS OF PREPARATION
Financial statements are presented annually. The accounting year begins on 1 January and ends on
31 December.


1.4.1.    Currency and basis for conversion

Functional and reporting currency

The financial statements are presented in millions of euros, unless stated otherwise, the euro being the
EU's functional and reporting currency.

Transactions and balances

Foreign currency transactions are translated into euros using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates
of the transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of foreign currency
transactions and from the re-translation at year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities
denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the statement of financial performance. Translation
differences on non-monetary financial instruments classified as available for sale financial assets are
included in the fair value reserve.

Different conversion methods apply to property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, which retain
their value in euros at the rate that applied at the date when they were purchased.

Year-end balances of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are converted into
euros on the basis of the European Central Bank (ECB) exchange rates applying on 31 December:

1.4.2.     Use of estimates

In accordance with IPSAS and generally accepted accounting principles, the financial statements
necessarily include amounts based on estimates and assumptions by management based on the most
reliable information available. Significant estimates include, but are not limited to: amounts for employee
benefit liabilities, provisions, financial risk on inventories and accounts receivable, accrued income and
charges, contingent assets and liabilities, degree of impairment of intangible assets and property, plant
and equipment and amounts disclosed in the notes concerning financial instruments. Actual results could
differ from those estimates. Changes in estimates are reflected in the period in which they become
known.




1.5.       BALANCE SHEET

1.5.1.     Intangible assets

Acquired computer software licences are stated at historical cost less accumulated amortisation and
impairment losses. The assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives
(3-11 years). The estimated useful lives of intangible assets depend on their specific economic lifetime or
legal lifetime determined by an agreement. Internally developed intangible assets are capitalised when
the relevant criteria of the EU accounting rules are met and relate solely to the development phase of the
asset. The costs capitalisable include all directly attributable costs necessary to create, produce, and
prepare the asset to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management. Costs associated
with research activities, non-capitalisable development costs and maintenance costs are recognised as
expenses as incurred.


1.5.2.     Property, plant and equipment

All property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and
impairment losses. Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition, construction
or transfer of the asset.

Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as
appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits or service potential associated with
the item will flow to the EU and its cost can be measured reliably. Repairs and maintenance costs are
charged to the statement of financial performance during the financial period in which they are incurred.




                                                    26
-----------------------Page 28 End-----------------------

                                 Annual accounts of the European Union 2016

Land and works of art are not depreciated as they are deemed to have an indefinite useful life. Assets
under construction are not depreciated as these assets are not yet available for use. Depreciation on
other assets is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate their cost less their residual values
over their estimated useful lives, as follows:

Type of asset                                                           Straight line depreciation rate
Buildings                                                                      4 % to 10 %
Space assets                                                                   8 % to 20 %
Plant and equipment                                                            10 % to 25 %
Furniture and vehicles                                                         10 % to 25 %
Computer hardware                                                              25 % to 33 %
Other                                                                          10 % to 33 %

Gains or losses on disposals are determined by comparing proceeds less selling expenses with the
carrying amount of the disposed asset and are included in the statement of financial performance.

Leases

Leases of tangible assets, where the EU has substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership, are
classified as finance leases. Finance leases are capitalised at the inception of the lease’s commencement
at the lower of the fair value of the leased asset and the present value of the minimum lease payments.
The interest element of the finance lease payment is charged to expenditure over the period of the lease
at a constant periodic rate in relation to the balance outstanding. The rental obligations, net of finance
charges, are included in financial liabilities (non-current and current). The interest element of the finance
cost is charged to the statement of financial performance over the lease period so as to produce a
constant periodic interest rate on the remaining balance of the liability for each period. The assets held
under finance leases are depreciated over the shorter of the asset's useful life and the lease term.

Leases where the lessor retains a significant portion of the risks and rewards inherent to ownership are
classified as operating leases. Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense in the statement
of financial performance on a straight-line basis over the lease term.


1.5.3.    Impairment of non-financial assets

Assets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortisation/depreciation and are tested
annually for impairment. Assets that are subject to amortisation/depreciation are reviewed for
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be
recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount
exceeds its recoverable (service) amount. The recoverable (service) amount is the higher of an asset’s
fair value less costs to sell and its value in use.

Intangible assets and property, plant and equipment residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and
adjusted if appropriate, at least once per year. An asset’s carrying amount is written down immediately
to its recoverable (service) amount if the asset’s carrying amount is greater than its estimated
recoverable (service) amount. If the reasons for impairments recognised in previous years no longer
apply, the impairment losses are reversed accordingly.


1.5.4.    Investments accounted for using the equity method

Participations in associates and joint ventures

Investments accounted for using the equity method are initially recognised at cost. The EU's interest in
these investments is recognised in the statement of financial performance, and its share in the
movements in reserves is recognised in the fair value reserve in net assets. The initial cost together with
all movements (further contributions, share of economic results and reserve movements, impairments,
and dividends) give the book value of the investment in the financial statements at the balance sheet
date. Distributions received from the investment reduce the carrying amount of the asset.

If the EU's share of deficits of an investment accounted for using the equity method equals or exceeds its
interest in the investment, the EU discontinues recognising its share of further losses ("unrecognised
losses"). After the EU's interest is reduced to zero, additional losses are provided for and a liability is



                                                     27
-----------------------Page 29 End-----------------------

                                   Annual accounts of the European Union 2016

recognised, only to the extent that the EU has incurred legal or constructive obligation or made payments
on behalf of the entity.

If there are indications of impairment, a write-down to the lower recoverable amount is necessary. The
recoverable amount is determined as described under note 1.5.3. If the reason for impairment ceases to
apply at a later date, the impairment loss is reversed to the carrying amount that would have been
determined had no impairment loss been recognised.

In cases where the EU holds 20 % or more of an investment capital fund, it does not seek to exert
significant influence. Such funds are therefore treated as financial instruments and categorised as
available for sale financial assets.

Associates and joint ventures classified as minor entities are not accounted for under the equity method.
EU contributions to those entities are accounted for as an expense of the period.


1.5.5.    Financial assets

Classification

The EU classifies their financial assets in the following categories: financial assets at fair value through
surplus or deficit; loans and receivables; held-to-maturity investments; and available for sale financial
assets. The classification of financial instruments is determined at initial recognition and re-evaluated at
each balance sheet date.

(i) Financial assets at fair value through surplus or deficit

A financial asset is classified in this category if acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the short
term or if so designated by the EU. Derivatives are also categorised in this category. Assets in this
category are classified as current assets if they are expected to be realised within 12 months of the
balance sheet date.

(ii) Loans and receivables

Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are
not quoted in an active market. They arise when the EU provides money, goods or services directly to a
debtor with no intention of trading the receivable, or in case the EU is subrogated to the rights of the
original lender following a payment made by the EU under a guarantee contract. Payments due within 12
months of the balance sheet date are classified as current assets. Payments due after 12 months from
the balance sheet date are classified as non-current assets. Loans and receivables include term deposits
with the original maturity above three months.

(iii) Held-to-maturity investments

Held-to-maturity investments are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments
and fixed maturities that the EU has the positive intention and ability to hold to maturity. During this
financial year, the EU did not hold any investments in this category.

(iv) Available for sale financial assets

Available for sale financial assets are non-derivatives that are either designated in this category or not
classified in any of the other categories. They are classified as either current or non-current assets,
depending on the period of time the EU expects to hold them, which is usually the maturity date.
Investments in entities that are neither consolidated nor accounted for using the equity method and other
equity-type investments (e.g. Risk Capital Operations) are also classified as available for sale financial
assets.

Initial recognition and measurement

Purchases and sales of financial assets at fair value through surplus or deficit, held-to-maturity and
available for sale are recognised on trade-date – the date on which the EU commits to purchase or sell
the asset. Cash equivalents and loans are recognised when cash is advanced to the borrowers. Financial
instruments are initially recognised at fair value. For all financial assets not carried at fair value through
surplus or deficit transactions costs are added to the fair value at initial recognition. Financial assets


                                                      28
-----------------------Page 30 End-----------------------

                                   Annual accounts of the European Union 2016

carried at fair value through surplus or deficit are initially recognised at fair value and transaction costs
are expensed in the statement of financial performance.

The fair value of a financial asset on initial recognition is normally the transaction price (i.e. the fair value
of the consideration received), unless the fair value of that instrument is evidenced by comparison with
other observable current market transactions in the same instrument or based on a valuation technique
whose variables include only data from observable markets (e.g. in case of some derivative contracts).
However, when a long-term loan that carries no interest or an interest below market conditions is
granted, its fair value can be estimated as the present value of all future cash receipts discounted using
the prevailing market rate of interest for a similar instrument with a similar credit rating.

Loans granted are measured at their nominal amount, which is considered to be the fair value of the
loan. The reasoning for this is as follows:

-   The “market environment” for EU lending is very specific and different from the capital market used
    to issue commercial or government bonds. As lenders in these markets have the opportunity to
    choose alternative investments, the opportunity possibility is factored into market prices. However,
    this opportunity for alternative investments does not exist for the EU which is not allowed to invest
    money on the capital markets; it only borrows funds for the purpose of lending at the same rate. This
    means that there is no alternative lending or investment option available to the EU for the sums
    borrowed. Thus, there is no opportunity cost and therefore no basis of comparison with market rates.
    In fact, the EU lending operation itself represents the market. Essentially, since the opportunity cost
    "option" is not applicable, the market price does not fairly reflect the substance of the EU lending
    transactions. Therefore, it is not appropriate to determine the fair value of EU lending with reference
    to commercial or government bonds.

-   Furthermore as there is no active market or similar transactions to compare with, the interest rate to
    be used by the EU for fair valuing its lending operations under the EFSM, BOP and other such loans,
    should be the interest rate charged.

-   In addition, for these loans, there are compensating effects between loans and borrowings due to
    their back-to-back character. Thus, the effective interest for the loan equals the effective interest rate
    for the related borrowings. The transaction costs incurred by the EU and then recharged to the
    beneficiary of the loan are directly recognised in the statement of financial performance.

Financial instruments are derecognised when the rights to receive cashflows from the investments have
expired or the EU has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership to another party.

Subsequent measurement
(i) Financial assets at fair value through surplus or deficit are subsequently carried at fair value. Gains
    and losses arising from changes in the fair value of the ‘financial instruments at fair value through
    surplus or deficit’ category are included in the statement of financial performance in the period in
    which they arise.
(ii) Loans and receivables are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method. In the case
     of loans granted on borrowed funds, the same effective interest rate is applied to both the loans and
     borrowings since these loans have the characteristics of 'back-to-back operations' and the differences
     between the loan and the borrowing conditions and amounts are not material. The transaction costs
     incurred by the EU and then recharged to the beneficiary of the loan are directly recognised in the
     statement of financial performance.
(iii) Held to maturity assets are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method. The EU
      currently holds no held to maturity investments.
(iv) Available for sale financial assets are subsequently carried at fair value. Gains and losses arising from
     changes in the fair value of available for sale financial assets are recognised in the fair value reserve,
     except for translation differences on monetary assets which are recognised in the statement of
     financial performance. When assets classified as available for sale financial assets are derecognised or
     impaired, the cumulative fair value adjustments previously recognised in the fair value reserve are
     recognised in the statement of financial performance. Interest on available for sale financial assets
     calculated using the effective interest method is recognised in the statement of financial performance.
     Dividends on available for sale equity instruments are recognised when the EU's right to receive
     payment is established.




                                                      29
-----------------------Page 31 End-----------------------

                                   Annual accounts of the European Union 2016

The fair values of quoted investments in active markets are based on current bid prices. If the market for
a financial asset is not active (and for unlisted securities and over-the–counter derivatives), the EU
establishes a fair value by using valuation techniques. These include the use of recent arm’s length
transactions, reference to other instruments that are substantially the same, discounted cashflow
analysis, option pricing models and other valuation techniques commonly used by market participants.

Investments in Venture Capital Funds, classified as available for sale financial assets, which do not have a
quoted market price in an active market are valued at the attributable net asset value, which is
considered as an equivalent of their fair value.

In cases where the fair value of investments in equity instruments that do not have a quoted market
price in an active market cannot be reliably measured, these investments are valued at cost less
impairment losses.

Impairment of financial assets

The EU assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset is
impaired. A financial asset is impaired and impairment losses are incurred if, and only if, there is
objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial
recognition of the asset and that loss event (or events) has an impact on the estimated future cashflows
of the financial asset that can be reliably estimated.

(a)      Assets carried at amortised cost

If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss on loans and receivables or held-to-maturity
investments carried at amortised cost has been incurred, the amount of the loss is measured as the
difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cashflows
(excluding future credit losses that have not been incurred) discounted at the financial asset’s original
effective interest rate. The carrying amount of the asset is reduced and the amount of the loss is
recognised in the statement of financial performance. If a loan or held-to-maturity investment has a
variable interest rate, the discount rate for measuring any impairment loss is the current effective
interest rate determined under the contract. The calculation of the present value of the estimated future
cashflows of a collateralised financial asset reflects the cashflows that may result from foreclosure less
costs for obtaining and selling the collateral, whether or not foreclosure is probable. If, in a subsequent
period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an
event occurring after the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised impairment loss is
reversed through the statement of financial performance.

(b)      Assets carried at fair value

In the case of equity investments classified as available for sale financial assets, a significant or
permanent (prolonged) decline in the fair value of the security below its cost is considered in determining
whether the securities are impaired. If any such evidence exists for available for sale financial assets, the
cumulative loss – measured as the difference between the acquisition cost and the current fair value, less
any impairment loss on that financial asset previously recognised in the statement of financial
performance – is removed from reserves and recognised in the statement of financial performance.
Impairment losses recognised in the statement of financial performance on equity instruments are not
reversed through the statement of financial performance. If, in a subsequent period, the fair value of a
debt instrument classified as available for sale financial asset increases and the increase can be
objectively related to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised, the impairment loss is
reversed through the statement of financial performance.


1.5.6.     Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is determined using the first-in,
first-out (FIFO) method. The cost of finished goods and work in progress comprises raw materials, direct
labour, other directly attributable costs and related production overheads (based on normal operating
capacity). Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the
costs of completion and selling expenses. When inventories are held for distribution at no charge or for a
nominal charge, they are measured at the lower of cost and current replacement cost. Current
replacement cost is the cost the EU would incur to acquire the asset on the reporting date.

                                  Annual accounts of the European Union 2016

1.5.7.    Pre-financing amounts

Pre-financing is a payment intended to provide the beneficiary with a cash advance, i.e. a float. It may be
split into a number of payments over a period defined in the particular contract, decision, agreement or
basic legal act. The float or advance is either used for the purpose for which it was provided during the
period defined in the agreement or it is repaid. If the beneficiary does not incur eligible expenditure, they
have the obligation to return the pre-financing advance to the EU. The amount of the pre-financing may
be reduced (wholly or partially) by the acceptance of eligible costs (which are recognised as expenses).

Pre-financing is, on subsequent balance sheet dates, measured at the amount initially recognised on the
balance sheet less eligible expenses (including estimated amounts where necessary) incurred during the
period.

Interest on pre-financing is recognised as it is earned in accordance with the provisions of the relevant
agreement. An estimate of the accrued interest revenue, based on the most reliable information, is made
at the year-end and included on the balance sheet.

Other advances to Member States which originate from reimbursement by the EU of amounts paid as
advances by the Member States to their beneficiaries (including "financial instruments under shared
management") are recognised as assets and presented under the pre-financing heading. Other advances
to Member States are subsequently measured at the amount initially recognised on the balance sheet
less a best estimate of the eligible expenses incurred by final beneficiaries, calculated on the basis of
reasonable and supportable assumptions.

The EU contributions to the trust funds of the European Development Fund or other unconsolidated
entities are also classified as pre-financing since their purpose is to give a float to the trust fund to allow
it to finance specific actions defined under the trust fund's objectives. The EU contributions to trust funds
are measured at the initial amount of the EU contribution less eligible expenses, including estimated
amounts where necessary, incurred by the trust fund during the reporting period and allocated to the EU
contribution in accordance with the underlying agreement.


1.5.8.    Exchange receivables and non-exchange recoverables

As the EU accounting rules require a separate presentation of exchange and non-exchange transactions,
for the purpose of drawing up the accounts, receivables are defined as stemming from exchange
transactions and recoverables are defined as stemming from non-exchange transactions, i.e. when the
EU receives value from another entity without directly giving approximately equal value in exchange (for
example recoverables from Member States related to own resources).

Receivables from exchange transactions meet the definition of financial instruments and are thus
classified as loans and receivables and measured accordingly (see note 1.5.5). The financial instruments
notes disclosures concerning receivables from exchange transactions include accrued income and
deferred charges from exchange transactions as they are not material.

Recoverables from non-exchange transactions are carried at original amount (adjusted for interest and
penalties) less write-down for impairment. A write-down for impairment of recoverables from
non-exchange transactions is established when there is objective evidence that the EU will not be able to
collect all amounts due according to the original terms of recoverables from non-exchange transactions.
The amount of the write-down is the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the recoverable
amount. The amount of the write-down is recognised in the statement of financial performance. A general
write-down, based on past experience, is also made for outstanding recovery orders not already subject
to a specific write-down. See note 1.5.14 concerning the treatment of accrued income at year-end.
Amounts displayed and disclosed as recoverables from non-exchanges transactions are not financial
instruments as they do not arise from a contract that would give rise to a financial liability or equity
instrument. However, in the notes to the financial statements recoverables from non-exchange
transactions are disclosed together with receivables from exchange transactions where appropriate.

                                  Annual accounts of the European Union 2016

1.5.9.    Cash and cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents are financial instruments and include cash at hand, deposits held at call or at
short notice with banks and other short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three
months or less.


1.5.10. Pension and other employee benefits

Pension obligations

The EU operates defined benefit pension plans. Whilst staff contribute from their salaries one third of the
expected cost of these benefits, the liability is not funded. The liability recognised in the balance sheet in
respect of defined benefit pension plans is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the
balance sheet date less the fair value of any plan assets. The defined benefit obligation is calculated by
actuaries using the projected unit credit method. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is
determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of government bonds
that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity
approximating to the terms of the related pension liability.

Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are
recognised immediately in the statement of financial performance. Past-service costs are recognised
immediately in statement of financial performance, unless the changes to the pension plan are
conditional on the employees remaining in service for a specified period of time (the vesting period). In
this case, the past-service costs are amortised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.

Post-employment sickness benefits

The EU provides health benefits to its employees through the reimbursement of medical expenses.
A separate fund has been created for its day-to-day administration. Both current employees, pensioners,
widowers and their relatives benefit from the system. The benefits granted to the "inactives" (pensioners,
orphans, etc.) are classified as "Post-Employment Employee Benefits". Given the nature of these benefits,
an actuarial calculation is required. The liability in the balance sheet is determined on a similar basis as
that for the pension obligations (see above).


1.5.11. Provisions

Provisions are recognised when the EU has a present legal or constructive obligation towards third parties
as a result of past events, it is more likely than not that an outflow of resources will be required to settle
the obligation, and the amount can be reliably estimated. Provisions are not recognised for future
operating losses. The amount of the provision is the best estimate of the expenses expected to be
required to settle the present obligation at the reporting date. Where the provision involves a large
number of items, the obligation is estimated by weighting all possible outcomes by their associated
probabilities (“expected value” method).


1.5.12. Financial liabilities

Financial liabilities are classified as financial liabilities at fair value through surplus or deficit or as
financial liabilities carried at amortised cost. Borrowings are composed of borrowings from credit
institutions and debts evidenced by certificates. They are recognised initially at fair value, being their
issue proceeds (fair value of consideration received) net of transaction costs incurred, then subsequently
carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method; any difference between proceeds, net of
transaction costs, and the redemption value is recognised in the statement of financial performance over
the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.

Financial liabilities are classified as non-current liabilities, except for maturities less than 12 months after
the balance sheet date. In the case of loans granted on borrowed funds, the effective interest method
may not be applied to loans and borrowings, based on materiality considerations. The transaction costs
incurred by the EU and then recharged to the beneficiary of the loan are directly recognised in the
statement of financial performance.

                                  Annual accounts of the European Union 2016

EU trust funds that are considered as part of the Commission's operational activities are accounted for in
the Commission accounts and further consolidated in the EU annual accounts. Therefore, contributions
from other donors to the EU trust funds fulfil the criteria of revenues from non-exchange transactions
under conditions and they are presented as financial liabilities until the conditions attached to the
contributions transferred are met, i.e. eligible costs are incurred by the trust fund. The trust fund is
required to finance specific projects and return remaining funds at the time of winding-up. At the balance
sheet date the outstanding contribution liabilities are measured at contributions received less the
expenses incurred by the trust fund, including estimated amounts when necessary. For reporting
purposes the net expenses are allocated to the contributions of other donors in proportion to net
contributions paid as at 31 December. This allocation of contributions is only indicative. When the trust
fund is wound up the actual split of remaining resources will be decided by the trust fund board.

Financial liabilities categorised at fair value through surplus or deficit include derivatives when their fair
value is negative. They follow the same accounting treatment as financial assets at fair value through
surplus or deficit, see note 1.5.5.


1.5.13. Payables

A significant amount of the payables of the EU are unpaid cost claims from beneficiaries of grants or
other EU funding (non-exchange transactions). They are recorded as payables for the requested amount
when the cost claim is received. Upon verification and acceptance of the eligible costs, the payables are
valued at the accepted and eligible amount.

Payables arising from the purchase of goods and services are recognised at invoice reception for the
original amount and corresponding expenses are entered in the accounts when the supplies or services
are delivered and accepted by the EU.


1.5.14. Accrued and deferred income and charges

Transactions and events are recognised in the financial statements in the period to which they relate. At
year-end, if an invoice is not yet issued but the service has been rendered, the supplies have been
delivered by the EU or a contractual agreement exists (e.g. by reference to a treaty), an accrued income
will be recognised in the financial statements. In addition, at year-end, if an invoice is issued but the
services have not yet been rendered or the goods supplied have not yet been delivered, the revenue will
be deferred and recognised in the subsequent accounting period.

Expenses are also accounted for in the period to which they relate. At the end of the accounting period,
accrued expenses are recognised based on an estimated amount of the transfer obligation of the period.
The calculation of accrued expenses is done in accordance with detailed operational and practical
guidelines issued by the Commission which aim at ensuring that the financial statements provide a
faithful representation of the economic and other phenomena they purport to represent. By analogy, if
payment has been made in advance for services or goods that have not yet been received, the expense
will be deferred and recognised in the subsequent accounting period.




1.6.      STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE

1.6.1.    Revenue

REVENUE FROM NON-EXCHANGE TRANSACTIONS

The vast majority of the EU's revenue relates to non-exchange transactions:

GNI based resources and VAT resources

Revenue is recognised for the period for which the Commission sends out a call for funds to the Member
States claiming their contribution. They are measured at their “called amount”. As VAT and GNI resources
are based on estimates of the data for the budgetary year concerned, they may be revised as changes



                                                     33
-----------------------Page 35 End-----------------------

                                 Annual accounts of the European Union 2016

occur until the final data are issued by the Member States. The effect of a change in estimate is included
when determining the net surplus or deficit for the period in which the change occurred.

Traditional own resources

Recoverables from non-exchange transactions and related revenues are recognised when the relevant
monthly "A" statements (including duties collected and amounts due that are guaranteed and not
contested) are received from the Member States. At the reporting date, revenue collected by the Member
States for the period but not yet paid to the Commission is estimated and recognised as accrued income.
The quarterly "B" statements (including duties neither collected nor guaranteed, as well as guaranteed
amounts that have been contested by the debtor) received from the Member States are recognised as
revenue less the collection costs to which they are entitled. In addition, a value reduction is recognised
for the amount of the estimated recovery gap.

Fines

Revenue from fines is recognised when the EU's decision imposing a fine has been taken and it is
officially notified to the addressee. If there are doubts about the undertaking's solvency, a value
reduction on the entitlement is recognised. After the decision to impose a fine, the debtors have two
months from the date of notification:

-   either to accept the decision, in which case they must pay the fine within the time limit laid down and
    the amount is definitively collected by the EU;

-   or not to accept the decision, in which case they lodge an appeal under EU law.

However, even if appealed, the fine must be paid within the time limit of three months laid down as the
appeal does not have suspensory effect (Article 278 of the EU Treaty) or, under certain circumstances
and subject to the agreement of the Commission's Accounting Officer, the debtor may present a bank
guarantee for the amount instead.

If the undertaking appeals against the decision, and has already provisionally paid the fine, the amount is
disclosed as a contingent liability. However, since an appeal against an EU decision by the addressee
does not have suspensory effect, the cash received is used to clear the recoverable. If a guarantee is
received instead of payment, the fine remains as a recoverable. If it appears probable that the General
Court may not rule in favour of the EU, a provision is recognised to cover this risk. If a guarantee had
been given instead, then the recoverable outstanding is written-down as required. The accumulated
interest received by the Commission on the bank accounts where received payments are deposited is
recognised as revenue, and any contingent liability is increased accordingly.

Since 2010, all provisionally cashed fines are managed by the Commission in a specifically created fund
(BUFI) and invested in financial instruments.

REVENUE FROM EXCHANGE TRANSACTIONS

Revenue from the sale of goods and services is recognised when the significant risk and rewards of
ownership of the goods are transferred to the purchaser. Revenue associated with a transaction involving
the provision of services is recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the transaction at the
reporting date.

Interest income and expense

Interest income and expense are recognised in the statement of financial performance using the effective
interest method. This is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial asset or a financial
liability and of allocating the interest income or interest expense over the relevant period. When
calculating the effective interest rate, the EU estimates cashflows considering all contractual terms of the
financial instrument (for example prepayment options) but does not consider future credit losses. The
calculation includes all fees and points paid or received between parties to the contract that are an
integral part of the effective interest rate, transaction costs and all other premiums or discounts.

Once a financial asset or a group of similar financial assets has been written down as a result of an
impairment loss, interest income is recognised using the rate of interest to discount the future cashflows
for the purpose of measuring the impairment loss.

                                   Annual accounts of the European Union 2016

Dividend income

Dividend income is recognised when the right to receive payment is established.


1.6.2.    Expenses

Expenses from non-exchange transactions account for the majority of the EU's expenses. They relate to
transfers to beneficiaries and can be of three types: entitlements, transfers under agreement and
discretionary grants, contributions and donations.

Transfers are recognised as expenses in the period during which the events giving rise to the transfer
occurred, as long as the nature of the transfer is allowed by regulation (Financial Regulation, Staff
Regulations, or other regulation) or an agreement has been signed authorising the transfer; any eligibility
criteria have been met by the beneficiary; and a reasonable estimate of the amount can be made.

When a request for payment or cost claim is received and meets the recognition criteria, it is recognised
as an expense for the eligible amount. At year-end, incurred eligible expenses due to the beneficiaries
but not yet reported are estimated and recorded as accrued expenses.

Expenses from exchange transactions arising from the purchase of goods and services are recognised
when the supplies are delivered and accepted by the EU. They are valued at original invoice amount.
Furthermore, at the balance sheet date expenses related to the service delivered during the period for
which an invoice has not yet been received or accepted are estimated and recognised in the statement of
financial performance.




1.7.      CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES

1.7.1.    Contingent assets

A contingent asset is a possible asset that arises from past events and of which the existence will be
confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly
within the control of the EU. A contingent asset is disclosed when an inflow of economic benefits or
service potential is probable.


1.7.2.    Contingent liabilities

A contingent liability is a possible obligation that arises from past events and of which the existence will
be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly
within the control of the EU; or a present obligation that arises from past events but is not recognised
because: it is not probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits or service potential
will be required to settle the obligation or in the rare circumstances where the amount of the obligation
cannot be measured with sufficient reliability.



1.8.      CASHFLOW STATEMENT
Cashflow information is used to provide a basis for assessing the ability of the EU to generate cash and
cash equivalents, and its needs to utilise those cashflows.

The cashflow statement is prepared using the indirect method. This means that the economic result for
the financial year is adjusted for the effects of transactions of a non-cash nature, any deferrals or
accruals of past or future operating cash receipts or payments, and items of revenue or expense
associated with investing cashflows.

Cashflows arising from transactions in a foreign currency are recorded in the EU’s reporting currency
(Euro), by applying to the foreign currency amount the exchange rate between the euro and the foreign
currency at the date of the cashflow.


                                                      35
-----------------------Page 37 End-----------------------

                                  Annual accounts of the European Union 2016

The cashflow statement reports cashflows during the period classified by operating and investing
activities (the EU does not have financing activities).

Operating activities are the activities of the EU that are not investing activities. These are the majority of
the activities performed. Loans granted to beneficiaries (and the related borrowings, when applicable) are
not considered as investing (or financing) activities as they are part of the general objectives and thus
daily operations of the EU. Operating activities also include investments such as investments in the
European Investment Fund (EIF), the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and
venture capital funds. Indeed, the aim of these activities is to contribute to the achievement of policy
objectives.

Investing activities are the acquisition and disposal of intangible assets and property, plant and
equipment and of other investments which are not included in cash equivalents. Investing activities do
not include loans granted to beneficiaries. The objective is to show the real investments made by the EU.

The above amounts relate primarily to computer software.




2.2.      PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT
The Space assets category covers fixed assets related to the two EU space programmes: the Global
Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) – Galileo and EGNOS, and the Copernicus European Earth
observation programme. In 2015 fixed assets related to EGNOS and Copernicus, amounting to
EUR 584 million, had been included under the Plant and Equipment category.

For Galileo, following the declaration of the Galileo Initial Services on 15 December 2016, a balance of
EUR 2 165 million of satellites and ground segment assets was transferred from assets under
construction to fixed assets, including 14 operational Galileo satellites as well as ground infrastructure.
The Galileo operational fixed assets amounted to EUR 2 146 million at 31 December 2016, net of
depreciation.    The    remaining    assets   under    construction    totalling  EUR 756 million   (2015:
EUR 2 110 million) include 4 satellites launched in 2016 but for which the in-orbit testing had not yet
been completed at the balance sheet date. The development of the Galileo system will continue until the
system reaches its full operational capacity. When completed, the Galileo constellation will comprise 30
satellites.

Regarding Copernicus, EUR 1 073 million concerning the Copernicus satellites in operation (Sentinels 1A,
2A, 3A and 1B) are recognised under the heading Space assets (2015: EUR 498 million), net of
accumulated depreciation. Another EUR 1 133 million related to Copernicus satellites is recognised as
assets under construction (2015: EUR 1 188 million).

Fixed assets related to the European Geostationary Navigation Overlay System (EGNOS) ground
infrastructure of EUR 83 million (2015: EUR 85 million) are also included under the Space assets heading.
In addition, EGNOS assets under construction amount to EUR 21 million (2015: EUR 14 million).

The assets related to the EU space programmes are being built with the assistance of the European
Space Agency (ESA).

2.3.1.    Participations in joint ventures

There are a number of entities partially funded by the EU that meet the requirements to be accounted for
using the equity method in the EU consolidated financial statements but are immaterial to the financial
statements as a whole, and therefore have not been accounted for using the equity method in the 2016
consolidated financial statements. These entities are referred to as 'Minor Entities' - see note 1.3. An
annual assessment of immateriality is performed to determine whether this exclusion continues to be
justified. The EU contributions to these entities have been accounted for as an expense. Note 9 includes
the list of those entities in 2016.


2.3.2.    Participations in associates

The participation of the EU in the European Investment Fund (EIF) is treated as an associate using the
equity method of accounting. The EIF is the EU's financial institution specialising in providing risk capital
and guarantees to Small and Medium-sized Entities (SMEs). The EIF is located in Luxemburg and
operates as a private-public partnership, whose members are the European Investment Bank (EIB), the
EU and a group of financial institutions. At 31 December 2016 the EU held 28.1 % of ownership interests
in EIF (2015: 26.5 %) and 28.1 % of the voting rights (2015: 26.5 %). In accordance with its statutes,
the EIF is required to allocate to a statutory reserve at least 20 % of its annual net profit until the
aggregate reserve amounts to 10 % of subscribed capital. This reserve is not available for distribution.

                                                                                                  EUR millions

BUFI investments
Provisionally cashed fines related to competition cases are allocated to a dedicated fund (BUFI Fund -
'Budget Fines' Fund) and invested by the Commission in debt instruments categorised as available for
sale financial assets.

As the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) is not quoted on any stock exchange
and in view of the contractual restrictions included in the EBRD’s articles of incorporation relating,
amongst others, to the sale of participating interests, capped at acquisition cost and only authorised to
existing shareholders, the EU's shareholding is valued at cost.

GUARANTEE FUNDS FOR BUDGETARY GUARANTEES

Guarantee Fund for external actions
The Guarantee Fund for external actions covers loans guaranteed by the EU budget, in particular EIB
lending operations outside the EU financed from the EIB's own resources and loans under macro-financial
assistance (MFA) and Euratom loans outside the EU – see note 4.1.1. It is a long-term instrument (non-
current part: EUR 1 946 million) managed by the EIB and intended to cover any defaulting loans
guaranteed by the EU. The Fund is endowed by payments from the EU budget, the proceeds from interest
on investments made from the Fund's assets, and sums recovered from defaulting debtors for whom the
Fund has had to activate its guarantee. The Fund should be maintained at a target amount corresponding
to the 9 % of the guaranteed loans outstanding at year-end. The difference between the target amount
and the value of the Fund's assets at year-end shall be covered from the EU budget in year n+2, while
any surplus is paid back to the EU budget.

EFSI Guarantee Fund
Pursuant to the EFSI Regulation the EFSI Guarantee Fund has been established to provide a liquidity
cushion against potential losses incurred by the EIB in relation to its financing and investment operations
eligible for the EFSI EU guarantee under the EFSI Agreement - see note 4.1.1. The EFSI Guarantee Fund
is financed by contributions from the EU budget. It is also endowed by returns on guarantee fund
resources invested, revenues received by the EU as remuneration for the guarantee under the EFSI
Agreement, and amounts recovered by the EIB from defaulting debtors in respect of previous guarantee
calls. The fund is managed by the Commission, which is authorised to invest the assets of the EFSI
Guarantee Fund on the financial markets in accordance with the principle of sound financial management
following appropriate prudential rules. The EFSI Guarantee Fund started its operations in April 2016. It
will be progressively provisioned and gradually reach EUR 8 billion, i.e. 50 % of the total EU EFSI
guarantee over a time horizon spanning from 2016 to 2022.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS FINANCED BY THE EU BUDGET

For an overview of all financial instruments financed by the budget see the Financial Statement
Discussion and Analysis.

Horizon 2020
Under the EU Regulation establishing Horizon 2020 – the Framework Programme for Research and
Innovation (2014-2020), new financial instruments have been established in order to enhance access to
finance to entities engaged in research and innovation (R&I). These instruments are: the InnovFin Loan
and Guarantee Service for R&I under which the Commission shares the financial risk related to a portfolio
of new financing operations entered into by the EIB; the InnovFin SME Guarantee including the SME
Initiative Uncapped Guarantee Instrument (SIUGI) – guarantee facilities managed by the EIF providing
guarantees and counter-guarantees to the financial intermediaries for the new portfolios of loans (under
SIUGI the Commission shares the financial risk related to the guarantee given with Member States, EIF
and EIB); and the InnovFin Equity Facility for R&I providing for investments in venture capital funds and
managed by the EIF.

Risk-Sharing Finance Facility
The Risk-Sharing Finance Facility (RSFF) is managed by the EIB and the Commission's investment
portfolio is used to provision financial risk for loans and guarantees given by the EIB to eligible research

projects. In total, an EU budget of up to EUR 1 billion was allocated to the RSFF under the 2007-2013
MFF. Under the 2014-2020 MFF, there are no new budget contributions foreseen to the RSFF. The EU
overall risk is limited to the amount it contributes to the Facility.

Connecting Europe Facility
Pursuant to Regulation (EU) No 1316/2013, the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) debt instrument has
been established with the objective to facilitate infrastructure projects’ access to financing in the sectors
of transport, telecommunications and energy. It is managed by the EIB under an agreement with the EU.
The CEF debt financial instrument is the continuity of the Loan Guarantee Instrument for TEN-T projects
(LGTT) and of the pilot phase of the Project Bond Initiative (PBI). The LGTT and the PBI Portfolio were
merged into the CEF financial instrument with effect from 1 January 2016. It offers risk-sharing for debt
financing in the form of senior and subordinated debt or guarantee as well as support for project bonds.

ETF Start up
These are equity instruments that were financed by the Growth & Employment programme, the MAP
programme, the CIP programme and the Technology Transfer Pilot Project, under the trusteeship of the
EIF, supporting the creation and financing of Start-Up SMEs by investing in suitable specialised venture
capital funds.

forward contract

In 2016 the EU entered into two foreign currency forward contracts in order to hedge the foreign
currency risk related to USD denominated debt securities held in the EFSI Guarantee Fund. Under these
currency forward contracts the EU shall deliver the contractually agreed notional amount in foreign
currency ('pay leg') and will receive the notional amount in EUR ('receive leg') at the maturity date.
These derivative contracts are measured at fair value at the balance sheet date and classified as either
financial assets or financial liabilities at fair value through surplus or deficit depending on whether their
fair value is positive or negative. At 31 December 2016, one foreign currency forward contract, with a
notional amount of EUR 50 million, resulted in positive fair value of EUR 0.5 million and has been
recognised under financial assets. The other contract, for the notional amount of EUR 101 million,
resulted in negative fair value and as such has been recognised as a financial liability - see note 2.11.2.

At 31 December 2016 all financial assets at fair value through surplus or deficit are categorised into
level 2 of the fair value hierarchy – see table below.

EFSM enables the granting of financial assistance to a Member State in difficulties or seriously threatened
with severe difficulties caused by exceptional circumstances beyond its control. The assistance may take
the form of a loan or credit line. The ECOFIN Council conclusions of 9 May 2010 restrict the facility to
EUR 60 billion but the legal limit restricts the outstanding amount of loans or credit lines to the margin
available under the own resources ceiling. Borrowings related to loans disbursed under the EFSM are
guaranteed by the EU budget. It is not foreseen that the EFSM will engage in new financing programmes
or enter into new loan facility agreements.
The BOP facility, a policy-based financial instrument, provides medium-term financial assistance to
Member States of the EU that have not adopted the Euro. It enables the granting of loans to Member
States who are experiencing, or are seriously threatened with, difficulties in their balance of payments or
capital movements. The maximum outstanding amount of loans granted under the instrument is limited
to EUR 50 billion. Borrowings related to these BOP loans are guaranteed by the EU budget.
MFA is a policy-based financial instrument of untied and undesignated balance of payment and/or budget
support to partner countries currently following an IMF programme. It takes the form of medium/long
term loans or grants or an appropriate combination of both and generally complements financing
provided in the context of an IMF-supported adjustment and reform program. These loans are
guaranteed by the Guarantee Fund for external actions. At 31 December 2016, EUR 1 313 million relating
to a loan facility agreement under MFA assistance were granted to Ukraine (EUR 1 200 million), to Tunisia
(EUR 100 million), to Georgia (EUR 13 million) but not yet disbursed – see note 4.1.2.

The level of pre-financing amounts in the various programmes must be sufficient to ensure the necessary
funding for the beneficiary to start the project, while also safeguarding the financial interests of the EU
and taking into consideration legal, operational and cost-effectiveness constraints. All these elements
have been given due consideration by the Commission in an effort to improve the follow-up of pre-
financing.

Pre-financing represents money paid out, and thus implementation of payment appropriations. As
explained in note 1.5.7, these are advances and so not yet expensed. Thus while pre-financing reduces
outstanding RAL (see note 5.1) it represents expenses still to be recognised in the statement of financial
performance.

The closure of programming period 2007-2013 and the gradual set-up of programs under the period
2014-2020 are the major factors influencing the amounts on the balance sheet: pre-financing related to

                                                      45

                                 Annual accounts of the European Union 2016

the old programs is decreasing due to the acceptance of costs, while further pre-financings have been
paid out concerning the new programming period.

For shared management this transition between programming periods also explains the movement
between current and non-current balances. The programming period 2007-2013 is in its closing phase
and thus more amounts become due within twelve months. Concerning the programming period 2014 -
2020, the initial pre-financing paid is booked as non-current, while the annual pre-financing is booked as
current.

The table above shows a significant decrease in the gross pre-financing amounts under shared
management, which is explained by the clearing of EUR 18 521 million of costs offset partially by the
payment of new pre-financing of EUR 12 426 million.

Guarantees received in respect of pre-financing

These are guarantees that the Commission requests from beneficiaries that are not Member States in
certain cases when paying out advance payments (pre-financing). There are two values to disclose for
this type of guarantee, the “nominal” and the “on-going” values. For the nominal value, the generating
event is linked to the existence of the guarantee. For the on-going value, the guarantee’s generating
event is the pre-financing payment and/or subsequent clearings. At 31 December 2016 the nominal value
of guarantees received in respect of pre-financing amounted to EUR 683 million while the on-going value
of those guarantees was EUR 496 million (2015: EUR 844 million and EUR 626 million respectively).

Certain pre-financing amounts paid out under the 7th Research Framework Programme for research and
technological development (FP7) and under Horizon 2020 are effectively covered by a Participants
Guarantee Fund (PGF). The PGF is a mutual benefit instrument set up to cover the risks relating to non-
payment of amounts by the beneficiaries during the implementation of the indirect actions of FP7 and
Horizon 2020. All participants of indirect actions receiving a grant from the EU contribute 5 % of the total
amount received to the PGF's capital.

At 31 December 2016 pre-financing amounts covered by the PGF totalled EUR 1.8 billion (2015:
EUR 1.7 billion). The EU (represented by the Commission) acts as an executive agent of the participants
of the PGF, but the fund is owned by the participants.

At year-end, the PGF had total assets of EUR 1 951 million (2015: EUR 1 838 million). The assets of the
PGF also include financial assets that are managed by the Directorate-General for Economic and Financial
Affairs of the Commission. As the PGF is a separate entity the assets of the fund are not consolidated in
these EU annual accounts.

Advances to Member States for financial instruments under shared management

Under the framework of the European Structural and Investment Funds (ESIF) programmes, it is possible
to make advance payments from the EU budget to Member States so as to allow them to contribute to
financial instruments (i.e. loans, equity investments or guarantees). These financial instruments are set
up and managed under the responsibility of the Member States, not the Commission. Nevertheless,
monies that are unused by these instruments at year-end are the property of the EU (as with all pre-
financing) and are thus treated as an asset on the EU’s balance sheet.

                                Annual accounts of the European Union 2016

2014-2020 Period:

Under cohesion policy the Member States have contributed an amount of EUR 3 681 million, of which it is
estimated that EUR 1 842 million was still to be implemented at 31 December 2016. This includes the
contribution of the Member States to the SME Initiative, an instrument aimed at stimulating additional
lending by the banking sector to SMEs (EUR 745 million paid, out of which EUR 481 million is estimated
as not yet implemented).

For rural development, EUR 6 million remained unused at year-end.

2007-2013 Period:

In the previous programming period, the basic legal acts do not oblige the Member States to provide
periodic reports to the Commission on the use of these advances, and in some cases not even to identify
them in the statements of expenditure submitted to the Commission.

For cohesion policy, every year the Commission collects information from the Member States on these
financial instruments and consolidates it in an annual implementation report. The next report will be the
final implementation report but this report will not be available in time for inclusion in these accounts.
Consequently, and consistent with previous years, the measurement is estimated on the basis of the
most recent reliable information available, i.e. the annual implementation report as at 31 December 2015
and disbursements made during 2016. The estimate also relies on the assumption that funds will be used
in full and used evenly over the remaining period of operation (ending 31 March 2017). It is estimated
that at year-end 2016 an amount of EUR 686 million was still to be used for investments in final
beneficiaries.

For rural development, at year-end, all amounts have been implemented or re-allocated to other
measures before the end of the programming period.

Aid Schemes

Similar to the above, advances paid by the Member States for various aid schemes (state aid, market
measures of EAGF or investment measures of EAFRD) that were not used at year-end are recorded as
assets on the EU's balance sheet. The Commission has estimated the value of these advances based on
information provided by the Member States; the resulting amounts are included under the Aid Schemes
sub-heading above.

2014-2020 Period:

For cohesion policy, EUR 117 million was unused at year-end.

For agriculture policy, the Commission requested information on the unused amounts directly from the
paying agencies in the Member States. On the basis of this information, it is estimated that
EUR 721 million remained unused at year-end.

2007-2013 Period:

It is estimated that EUR 461 million representing advances paid in the context of the agricultural policy
remained unused at the end of 2016.

                                Annual accounts of the European Union 2016

Own resources recoverables

Traditional own resources (TOR), composed of customs duties and sugar levies, are collected by Member
States on behalf of the Commission. Member States establish TOR and communicate the amounts of the
entitlements established to the Commission by means of monthly 'A account' statements. Established
entitlements that have not been included in the 'A accounts', because they have not been recovered by
Member States and no security has been provided (or if security has been provided but are anyway
contested), are shown in the 'separate account'.

The Member States’ contribution based on VAT and GNI is subject to an annual adjustment which takes
place every year on the first working day of December. The own resources to be received included also
the adjustments for the financial years 2014, 2015 and 2016 related to the new provisions introduced by
the Own Resources Decision (ORD) 2014 following the completion of the ratification process and the
entry into force on 1 October 2016, which were due for payment by Member States on 1 January 2017.

Corrections may still be made to the actual VAT and GNI bases during the subsequent four years, unless
a reservation is issued. These reservations have to be seen as potential claims on the Member States for
uncertain amounts as their financial impact cannot be estimated with accuracy. When the exact amount
can be determined, the corresponding VAT and GNI-based resources are called either in connection with
VAT and GNI balances or by individual calls for funds.

EAGF and Rural Development recoverables

This item primarily covers the amounts owed by Member States at 31 December 2016, as declared and
certified by the Member States at 15 October 2016. An estimation is made for the recoverables arising
after this declaration and up to 31 December 2016. The Commission also estimates a write-down for the
amounts owed by beneficiaries that are unlikely to be recovered. The fact that such an adjustment is
made does not mean that the Commission is waiving future recovery of these amounts. A deduction of
20 % is also included in the adjustment, and corresponds to what Member States are allowed to retain to
cover administrative costs.


2.6.1.2.   Fines


This refers to fines issued by the Commission which were not (provisionally) cashed at year end
(EUR 1 986 million) less amounts written-down (EUR 178 million). Guarantees totalling EUR 1 012 million
were received for the fines outstanding at year-end (2015: EUR 1 428 million). It should be noted that
EUR 651 million of these receivables were due for payment after 31 December 2016.

2.8.1.     Bank accounts for budget implementation and other term deposits

This heading covers the funds which the Commission keeps in its bank accounts in each Member State
and EFTA country (treasury or central bank), as well as in commercial bank current accounts, imprest
accounts and petty cash. The exceptionally high treasury balance at the end of 2016 is due to the
following main elements:
    •    As regards own resources, the end of year balance includes a total net amount of EUR 7.7 billion
         to be returned to Member States in early 2017 as result of amending budgets adopted late in
         2016. In addition, advances on own resources amounting to EUR 1.5 billion were received in the
         final days of 2016.

-----------------------Page 52 End-----------------------

                                 Annual accounts of the European Union 2016

   •     A significant amount of fines imposed by the Commission for breach of competition rules of
         EUR 4.3 billion were definitively cashed in 2016 and are part of the year-end treasury balance.
   •     The treasury balance also includes the assigned revenue and payment appropriations not spent
         by the end of 2016 of EUR 11 billion.


2.8.2.    Cash belonging to financial instruments

Amounts shown under this heading primarily concern cash equivalents managed by fiduciaries on behalf
of the Commission for the purpose of implementing particular financial instrument programmes funded
by the EU budget (see note 2.4.1). The cash belonging to financial instruments can only be used in the
programme concerned.


2.8.3.    Cash relating to fines

This is cash received in connection with fines issued by the Commission for which the case is still open.
These amounts are kept in specific deposit accounts that are not used for any other activities. Where an
appeal has been lodged or where it is unknown if an appeal will be made by the other party, the
underlying amount is shown as contingent liability in note 4.1.4.

The decrease in this balance is due to the fact that since 2010, all new provisionally cashed fines are
managed by the Commission in the BUFI fund and invested in financial instruments categorised as
available for sale (see note 2.4.1).

LIABILITIES

The increase in the total employee benefits liability is primarily due to an increase in the net liability of
the Pension Scheme of European Officials. This increase is mainly due to the reduction in the real
discount rate from 0.6 % to 0.3 %, together with the fact that additional rights gained by scheme
members exceeded benefit payments out of the scheme.


2.9.1.    Pension Scheme of European Officials

This defined benefit obligation represents the present value of expected future payments that the EU is
required to make so as to settle the pension obligations resulting from employee service in the current
and prior periods. The scheme is ongoing, and as such, all payments required to be made from the
scheme on an annual basis are included in the EU budget each year.

In accordance with Article 83 of the Staff Regulations, the payment of the benefits provided for in the
staff pension scheme constitutes a charge to the EU's budget. The scheme is unfunded, but the Member
States guarantee the payment of these benefits collectively. A compulsory pension contribution is
deducted from the basic salaries of active members, currently 9.8 %. These contributions are treated as
budget revenue of the year and contribute to the funding of EU expenditure in general, see also note 3.6.

The liabilities of the pension scheme were assessed on the basis of the number of staff and retired staff
at 31 December 2016 and on the rules of the Staff Regulations applicable at this date. This valuation was
carried out in accordance with the methodology of IPSAS 25 (and therefore also EU accounting rule 12).
During 2016, the Commission has taken steps to strengthen the processes and the reliability of the basic
data collection used for calculating the employee benefits liability. The work will continue during 2017 –
possible results, where appropriate, will be reflected in the 2017 accounts.


2.9.2.    Other retirement benefit schemes

This refers to the liability relating to the pension obligations towards Members and former Members of the
Commission, the Court of Justice (and General Court) and the Court of Auditors, the Secretaries General
of the Council, the Ombudsman, the European Data Protection Supervisor, and the European Union Civil
Service Tribunal. Also included under this heading is a liability relating to the pensions of Members of the
European Parliament.


2.9.3.    Joint Sickness Insurance Scheme

In addition to the above retirement benefit schemes, a valuation is made for the estimated liability that
the EU has regarding the Joint Sickness Insurance Scheme in relation to healthcare costs which must be
paid during employees' post-activity periods (net of their contributions).

Movement in present value of employee benefits defined benefit obligation

The present value of the defined benefit obligation is the discounted, without deducting any plan assets,
expected future payments required to settle the obligation resulting from employee service in the current
and prior periods.

An analysis of the current year movement in the defined benefit obligation is shown below:

Current service costs are the increase in the present value of the defined benefit obligation arising from
current members' service in the current period.

Interest costs are the increase during the period in the present value of the defined benefit obligation
because the benefits are one period closer to settlement.

Net Actuarial gains and losses comprise:
    -   Experience adjustments (the effects of differences between the previous actuarial assumptions
        for 2016 and what has actually occurred in 2016); and

    -   Effects of changes in actuarial assumptions, either financial (such as projected salary increases)
        or demographic (such as mortality rates). These assumptions are inherently uncertain and
        therefore can show significant movements from year to year.
Benefits are paid during the year according to the rules of the scheme. These benefits paid lead to a
decrease in the defined benefit obligation as they are no longer to be paid in the future.

the EU are shown below:

Mortality rates are based on the International Civil Servants Life Table (ICSLT 2013).

The nominal discount rate is determined as the value of the Euro zero-coupon yield (with a maturity of
21 years as of December 2016 for the Pension Scheme of European Officials (PSEO), and 26 years for the
Joint Sickness Insurance Scheme). The inflation rate used is the expected inflation rate over the
equivalent period. It must be determined empirically, based on prospective values as expressed by index-
linked bonds on the European financial markets. The real discount rate is calculated from the nominal
discount rate and the expected long-term inflation rate.

The significant increase in the employee benefits liability over the five years can largely be explained by a
reduction in the real discount rate used to discount the future cash flows. This reduction is linked to the
underlying economic conditions, particularly the fall in interest rates. For the main PSEO scheme, for
example, the real discount rate fell from 1.6 % at the end of 2012 to 0.3 % at the end of 2016.

Provisions are amounts, arising from past events, that will probably have to be paid by the EU budget in
the future.

Legal cases

This is the estimate of amounts that will probably have to be paid out after the year-end in relation to a
number of on-going legal cases.

Nuclear site dismantlement

In 2014 the basis for the provision was updated as per the "2014 updated JRC Strategy on
Decommissioning and Waste Management" (D&WM). It represents the follow up of the comments raised
by the Review of the JRC D&WM programme made by external experts in 2012. In accordance with EU
accounting rules, this provision is indexed for inflation and then discounted to its net present value (using
the Euro zero-coupon swap curve). At 31 December 2016, this resulted in a provision of
EUR 1 113 million, split between amounts expected to be used in 2016 (EUR 27 million) and afterwards
(EUR 1 086 million).

In view of the estimated duration of this programme (around 20 years), it should be pointed out that
there is some uncertainty about this estimate, and the final cost could be different from the amounts
currently recorded.

Financial provisions

These concern mainly provisions which represent the estimated losses that will be incurred in relation to
the guarantees given by the different financial instruments, where the EIF and the EIB are empowered to
issue guarantees in their own name but on behalf of and at the risk of the EU. The financial risk of the EU
linked to the guarantees is, however, capped. Non-current financial provisions are discounted to their net
present value (using the Euro Swap annual rate).

The increase in financial provisions relates mainly to additional provisions for outstanding loans to Syria
guaranteed under the EIB external lending mandate guarantee and to increased activities under H2020
and COSME guarantee instruments.

Borrowings mainly include debts evidenced by certificates amounting to EUR 54 951 million (2015:
EUR 56 656 million). The changes in carrying amount correspond to the change in accrued interests.

Aside from ECSC in liquidation, the repayment of the above borrowings are ultimately guaranteed by the
EU budget – see note 4.1.2, and by extension each Member State.

* Estimated non-eligible amounts and pending other advances to Member States.


Payables include cost statements received by the Commission under the framework of grant activities.
They are credited for the amount being claimed from the moment the demand is received. If the
counterpart is a Member State, they are classified as such. It is the same procedure for invoices and
credit notes received under procurement activities. The cost claims concerned have been taken into
account through the year-end cut-off procedures. Following these cut-off entries, estimated eligible
amounts have therefore been recorded in the accounts as expenses, while the remaining part is disclosed
as “Estimated non-eligible amounts and pending other advances to Member States” (see below).

Almost all of the cost claims are included in the budgetary RAL figure at year-end: all Member States
amounts and a large portion of other entity invoices.

The biggest movement concerns the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund and is due to a better
implementation of the payments at the Member States level in 2016 compared to 2015 – this meant that
actual claims were submitted and did not need to be estimated at year-end. The increase of
EUR 5.3 billion is, therefore, counter-balanced by a similar decrease in accruals - see note 2.13.

The significant decrease in payables under EAFRD is due primarily to a reduction in the claims received
for the period 2007-2013 which is in the advanced stages of closure.

The other major increase in payables concerns cohesion policy (EUR 13.9 billion in 2016 compared to
EUR 10.8 billion in 2015) and mostly relates to the previous programming period, 2007-2013. The cost
statements submitted in relation to the programming period 2014-2020 remain limited, for several
reasons e.g. the non-designation of several managing authorities.

In the 2014-2020 programming period, the Common Provisions Regulation applicable to the Structural
Funds (ERDF and ESF), Cohesion Fund and to the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF) foresees


                                                              58

                                  Annual accounts of the European Union 2016

that the EU budget is protected by means of a systematic retention of 10 % of the interim payments
made. By February following the end of the accounting year (1 July - 30 June), the control cycle is
complete both through management verifications by the managing authorities and audits by the audit
authorities. The Commission examines the assurance documents and the accounts provided by the
relevant authorities in the Member States. The payment / recovery of the final balance is made only after
this assessment is finalised and the accounts are accepted. The amount retained according to this
disposition at end 2016 totalled EUR 1 billion.

Own resources payables refer to the contribution of Member States to the EU budget to be reimbursed at
year-end following the 4th and 5th amending budget of 2016. The significant amount is due to the late
adoption of amending budget 4 and 5/2016 which were based on the own resource regulation and the
adjustments related to the new provisions introduced by the new own resources decision 2014 only paid
to Member States in January 2017.

Estimated non-eligible amounts and pending other advances to Member States

Payables are reduced by that part of the requests for reimbursement received, but not yet checked, that
was estimated to be non-eligible. The largest amounts concern the Structural Actions DGs. Payables are
also reduced by the part of requests for reimbursement received concerning other advances to Member
States (see note 2.5.2) still to pay at year end (EUR 395 million).

Requests for pre-financing

In addition to the above amounts, EUR 594 million of requests for pre-financing have been received and
were not yet paid at year-end. According to the EU accounting rules, these amounts are not booked as
payables.

The biggest movement concerns the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund (EAGF) and is due to a better
implementation in 2016 of the payments at the Member States level compared to 2015 – this meant that
actual claims were submitted and did not need to be estimated at year-end. The decrease of
EUR 5.2 billion is, therefore, counter-balanced by a similar increase in payables - see note 2.12.

The increase of EUR 3 billion in cohesion is due to increasing implementation at final beneficiaries level.

The increase in accruals concerning EAFRD (EUR 2.2 billion) is linked to a lower level of claims received
for the 2014-2020 period meaning that more amounts had to be accrued at year-end.

Aside from EAGF, all other Member State accruals are included in the budgetary RAL, as are most of the
'other' accruals – see note 5.1.

2.14.2. Guarantee Fund reserve

This reserve reflects the 9 % target amount of the outstanding amounts guaranteed by the EU budget
under the EIB external lending mandate, that is required to be kept as assets in the Guarantee Fund for
external actions (see note 2.4.1).


2.14.3. Other reserves

The amount relates primarily to the ECSC in liquidation reserve (EUR 1 524 million) for the assets of the
Research Fund for Coal and Steel, which was created in the context of the winding-up of the ECSC.

Total amounts to be called from Member States at 31.12.2016                                    76 881

This amount represents that part of the expenses incurred by the EU up to 31 December that must be
funded by future budgets. Many expenses are recognised under accrual accounting rules in the year N
although they may be actually paid in year N+1 (or later) and therefore funded using the budget of year
N+1 (or later). The inclusion in the accounts of these liabilities coupled with the fact that the
corresponding amounts are financed from future budgets, results in liabilities greatly exceeding assets at
the year-end. The most significant amounts to be highlighted concern the European Agricultural
Guarantee Fund activities and employee benefit liabilities.

It should also be noted that the above has no effect on the budget result – budget revenue should always
equal or exceed budget expenditure and any excess of revenue is returned to Member States.

          PERFORMANCE

REVENUE

REVENUE FROM NON-EXCHANGE TRANSACTIONS: OWN
RESOURCES

3.1.      GNI RESOURCES
Own resources revenue is the primary element of the EU's operating revenue. Of the three categories of
own resources, traditional own resources ("TOR"), the VAT-based resources and the GNI-based
resources, the GNI revenue of EUR 95 578 million (2015: EUR 95 355 million) is the most significant.



3.2.      TRADITIONAL OWN RESOURCES

                                                                                             EUR millions

Customs duties                                                                 20 301            18 524
Sugar levies                                                                      138               125
Total                                                                         20 439            18 649

Traditional own resources comprise custom duties and sugar levies. Member States retain, by way of
collection costs, 20 % of traditional own resources, and the above amounts are shown net of this
deduction.




3.3.      VAT RESOURCES
The VAT resource is levied on Member States’ VAT bases, which are notionally harmonised in accordance
with EU rules for this purpose. The VAT contribution is calculated applying a uniform rate of call of 0.3 %
to the base of each Member State. For the period 2014-2020, the Council Decision 2014/335/EU,
Euratom, foresees a reduced rate of call of 0.15 % for Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden. The
decrease of VAT revenue in 2016 is primarily explained by the fact that the reduced call rate was for the
first time applicable in 2016, following the entry into force of the own resource decision (ORD) 2014.




REVENUE FROM NON-EXCHANGE TRANSACTIONS:
TRANSFERS

3.4.      FINES
These revenues of EUR 3 858 million (2015: EUR 531 million) relate to fines imposed by the Commission
for breach of infringement rules, mainly related to competition cases. Receivables and related revenues
are recognised when the Commission decision imposing a fine has been taken and it is officially notified
to the addressee. The main amounts in 2016 and thus the significant increase as compared to the fines
revenue of 2015 concern fines in the markets for trucks (EUR 2 927 million) and the banking sector
(EUR 485 million).

This heading mainly represents the recovery orders issued by the Commission that are cashed or offset
against (i.e. deducted from) subsequent payments recorded in the Commission's accounting system,
made so as to recover expenditure previously paid out from the general budget. Recoveries are based on
controls, audits or eligibility analysis and therefore, these actions are an important consideration in
implementing the EU budget. These operations protect the EU budget from expenditure incurred in
breach of law and are particularly important since the audit results of the European Court of Auditors
have found a material level of error in payments made from the EU budget – see the Court's annual
report including the statement of assurance on the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions.

Recovery orders issued by Member States to beneficiaries of EAGF expenditure, as well as the variation of
accrued income estimations from the previous year-end to the current, are also included.

The amounts included in the above table represent revenue incurred through the issuance of recovery
orders. For this reason, these figures cannot and do not show the full extent of the measures taken to
protect the EU budget, particularly for cohesion policy where specific mechanisms are in place to ensure
the correction of ineligible expenditure, most of which do not involve the issuance of a recovery order.
Not included are amounts recovered through offsetting with expenses, amounts recovered by way of
withdrawals and recoveries of pre-financing amounts.

Shared management recoveries make up the bulk of the total:

Agriculture: EAGF and rural development

In the framework of the EAGF and the EAFRD, amounts accounted for as revenue of the year under this
heading are financial corrections of the year and reimbursements declared by Member States and
recovered during the year, as well as the net increase in the outstanding amounts declared by Member
States to be recovered at year-end concerning fraud and irregularities.

Cohesion policy

The main amounts related to cohesion policy include recovery orders issued by the Commission to
recover undue expenditure made in previous years and deductions from expenditure less the decrease in
accrued income at year-end.

                                 Annual accounts of the European Union 2016

The budgetary adjustments include the budget surplus from 2015 (EUR 1 349 million) which is indirectly
refunded to Member States by deduction of the amounts of own resources they have to transfer to the
EU in the following year – thus it is a revenue for 2016.

Staff taxes and contributions revenue arises primarily from deductions from staff salaries and is made up
of two significant amounts – staff pension contributions and taxes on income.

Contributions from third countries are contributions from EFTA countries and accession countries.

Contributions from Member States for external aid are mainly the amounts received to set up the Facility
for Refugees in Turkey.

Transfer of assets revenue relates mainly to the transfer of satellites under the Copernicus programme
(former GMES programme) from the European Space Agency (ESA) to the Commission (see note 2.2).
This transfer is a non-exchange transaction according to the EU accounting rules and will occur in future
periods for the remaining Copernicus satellites currently under construction.

Agricultural levies concern milk levies which are a market management tool aimed at penalising milk
producers who exceed their reference quantities. As it is not linked to prior payments by the Commission,
it is in practice considered as revenue for a specific purpose. The large amount for milk levies last year
was due primarily to the superlevy of EUR 811 million.

The transition from the former programming period 2007-2013 to the period 2014-2020 explains the
reduction of expenses of EUR 4.2 billion for the cohesion area: as would be expected, the costs declared
for the previous period are decreasing, while the costs related to the current period are increasing but
remain lower. The same reason explains the decrease of expenses incurred under European Agricultural
Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) and other rural development instruments by EUR 3.8 billion – see
also note 2.13.

The sub-heading ‘Other’ mainly includes: Fisheries and Maritime Affairs (EUR 756 million), Asylum and
Migration (EUR 310 million) and Fund for European Aid to the Most Deprived (EUR 178 million).

The decrease in other expenses is mainly due to write-off of fines imposed in 2015, where the Court of
Justice had decided in favour of the fined undertaking.

Included under Property, plant and equipment           related   expenses   are   EUR 383 million    (2015:
EUR 373 million) relating to operating leases.

Expenses relating to research and development are included in administrative and IT expenses and are
as follows:

                                                                                            EUR millions

4.        CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND ASSETS

4.1.      CONTINGENT LIABILITIES

Contingent liabilities are possible future payment obligations for the EU that may arise due to past events
or legally binding commitments taken but which will depend on future events not wholly under the
control of the EU. They relate mainly to financial guarantees given (on loans and financial assistance
programmes) and to legal risks. All contingent liabilities, except those relating to fines and guarantees
covered by funds (see note 2.4.1), would be financed, should they fall due, by the EU budget (and thus
the EU Member States) in the years to come.

The above table shows the extent of the exposure of the EU budget to possible future payments linked to
guarantees given to the EIB group. Disbursed amounts represent the amounts already given to final
beneficiaries, while signed amounts include these disbursed monies plus agreements already signed with
beneficiaries but not yet disbursed. The ceiling represents the total guarantee that the EU budget, and
thus its Member States, have committed to cover.

EIB external lending mandate guarantees

The EU budget guarantees loans signed and granted by the EIB from the EIB's own resources to third
countries. At 31 December 2016 the amount of loans outstanding and covered by the EU guarantee
totalled EUR 21.1 billion. The EU budget guarantees:

     •   EUR 19 481 million (2015: EUR 19 450 million) via the Guarantee Fund for external actions (see
         note 2.4.1), and

     •   EUR 1 664 million (2015: EUR 1 987 million) directly for loans granted to Member States before
         accession.

In addition to the EUR 21.1 billion disclosed above as a contingent liability, the EU guarantees
EUR 309 million of outstanding loans to Syria for which provisions have been made – see note 2.10.

The EU external lending mandate guarantee relating to loans granted by the EIB is limited to 65 % of the
outstanding balances for agreements signed after 2007 (mandates 2007-2013 and 2014-2020). For
agreements before 2007 the EU guarantee is limited to a percentage of the ceiling of the credit lines
authorised, in most cases 65 % but also 70 %, 75 % or 100 %. Where the ceiling is not reached, the EU
guarantee covers the full amount.

To disclose the maximum exposure faced by the EU at 31 December 2016, however, one must also
include loans authorised to be signed but not yet signed (EUR 10.5 billion) and loans signed but not
disbursed (EUR 9 billion).

European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI) guarantee

EFSI is an initiative that aims to increase the risk bearing capacity of the EIB Group by enabling the EIB
to invest up to EUR 61 billion in the EU. EFSI is not a separate legal entity or an investment fund in the
strict sense. The EFSI risk reserve offers protection to the EIB against potential losses for underlying
operations. It is composed of an allocation of EUR 5 billion of EIB's own capital and an EU budget
guarantee of up to EUR 16 billion (cap amount). It is the objective that additional funding of Member
States, national promotional banks and private investors would bring the investments in the EU to a total
of EUR 315 billion.

                                 Annual accounts of the European Union 2016

The EFSI operations are conducted within two windows: the Infrastructure and Innovation Window (IIW)
implemented by the EIB (EU guarantee of EUR 13 billion) and the SME Window (SMEW) implemented by
the EIF (EU guarantee of EUR 3 billion), both of which will have a debt portfolio and an equity portfolio.
The EIF acts under an agreement with the EIB on the basis of an EIB guarantee which itself is counter-
guaranteed by the EU.
For the purpose of the use of the EU guarantee the implementation of EFSI is supervised by a steering
board acting by consensus and composed of four members of which three are appointed by the
Commission and one by the EIB. The steering board does not take investment decisions.
The EU and the EIB have distinct roles within EFSI. EFSI is established within the EIB who finance the
operations (debt and equity investments) and, to do this, borrow the necessary funds on the capital
markets. Regarding the IIW, the EIB takes the investment decisions independently and manages the
operations in accordance with its rules and procedures, the same as applied to its own (risk) operations.
In order to ensure that investments made under EFSI remain focused on the specific objective of
addressing the market failures which hinders investment in the EU and that they are eligible for the
protection of the EU guarantee, a dedicated governance structure has been put in place. The investment
committee of independent experts examines each project proposed by the EIB regarding its eligibility for
the EU guarantee coverage. Once an operation is confirmed to be eligible, as EFSI guaranteed operation,
the decision to continue with the project and its management is then subject to the normal EIB project
cycle and governance process.
The role of the EU relates to the provision of the EU budget guarantee for part of the potential losses that
the EIB may suffer from its investments in debt and equity instruments. Consequently, the EU does not
intervene in the selection and management of EFSI operations, does not invest money in the EFSI
operations and it is not a direct contractual party to the underlying instruments. As the control criteria
and accounting requirements for consolidation of the EU accounting rules (and IPSAS) are not met, the
related assets are not accounted for in the consolidated annual accounts of the EU.
At all times, the EU guarantee is capped at EUR 16 billion and the aggregate net payments from the EU
budget shall not exceed this amount. EU guarantee payments would be made by the EFSI Guarantee
Fund – see note 2.4.1. At the end of 2016 the assets of the guarantee fund total EUR 1 billion, while
another EUR 2.4 billion have been committed but not yet paid and is included in the amount disclosed as
RAL in note 5.1.

The EU guarantee granted to the EIB group under EFSI is accounted for as a financial guarantee liability
in respect of the debt portfolio and as a contingent liability for both debt and equity portfolios. As the
guaranteed investments are financed and controlled by the EIB, the related financial assets are not
accounted for in the consolidated annual accounts of the EU.

Under the EFSI IIW debt portfolio, the EU guarantee covers the first loss piece of a portfolio of financing
operations entered into by the EIB, which are mainly standard loans and guarantees. The EU guarantee is
called when the debtor fails to make a payment when due or in the case of a debt restructuring. The EU
guarantee is remunerated in proportion to the risk taken by the EU and this happens in the form of a
distribution, between the EIB and the EU, of the risk-related revenues received by EIB from the
guaranteed operations. The EU revenues should first cover the losses incurred on the guaranteed
operations. The EU guarantee is therefore accounted for as financial guarantee liability and measured, at
initial recognition, at fair value, being the net present value of the premiums receivable (the EU
revenues). At subsequent balance sheet dates, the financial guarantee liability is measured at the higher
of the expected losses and the amount initially recognised less, when appropriate, the accumulated
amortisation of the revenue. The financial guarantee liability is presented net of the EU revenues still to
be received – zero at 31 December 2016 – see note 2.11.3.

Under the EFSI IIW equity portfolio, which consists of direct equity or quasi equity participations or
subordinated loans, the EIB invests pari-passu at its own risk and also at the risk of the EU.
Consequently, the EU guarantee covers for the part of the equity investments guaranteed by the EU, the
negative value adjustments (unrealised losses) at each balance sheet date, the realised losses at dis-
investment and the EIB funding costs. In cases where the value of an investment, which was previously
subject to a negative value adjustment, increases at subsequent reporting dates, the amount up to the
original cost of the investment is reimbursed by the EIB to the EU. At the time of the dis-investment, the
EU is also entitled to gains on the investment exceeding the original cost. The EU guarantee is
remunerated by revenues received by the EIB from the guaranteed operations, including interests,
dividends and realised gains. The settlement between the EU and the EIB happens annually net of losses
and revenues. At 31 December 2016, EUR 35.7 million of EU guaranteed operations under the IIW equity
portfolio have been invested, which were recorded as a contingent liability.

The SMEW equity portfolio, only began in 2016 and amounts have been immaterial. The accounting
treatment of the equity operations will be established by the Accounting Officer after consulting the EU
Advisory Group of Experts on Accounting Standards. EUR 5 million have been invested by the EIF and are
shown as contingent liability at 31 December 2016.

The contingent liability above includes operations of the COSME and H2020 programmes which are
covered by the EFSI EU guarantee under SMEW debt portfolio.

The EU budget guarantees the borrowings in the back-to-back transactions of the Commission taken to
finance lending to Member and non-Member States – see also note 6. These borrowings are already
recognised as liabilities on the EU balance sheet - see note 2.11.1 for further details. However, should
there be a default on the back-to-back-loans given out with these borrowings, the EU budget based on
Article 14 of Council Regulation 609/2014 would have to bear the full cost of the amount defaulted:

      •   Borrowings related to loans disbursed under the EFSM are guaranteed solely by the EU budget;
      •   Borrowings related to BOP loans are guaranteed solely by the EU budget;
      •   MFA loans are firstly guaranteed by the Guarantee Fund for external actions (see note 2.4.1) and
          then by the EU budget; and
      •   Guarantees from third-parties are the first cover for the entire amounts of the outstanding
          Euratom loans. The Guarantee Fund would cover the external lending amounts should the third
          party guarantees not provide for them.

ECSC in Liquidation loans granted on borrowed funds are not covered by an EU budgetary guarantee.
Instead, they are covered by financial assets of the ECSC in Liquidation – see note 2.4.1.

As mentioned in Article 140(3) FR, the budgetary expenditure linked to a financial instrument and the
financial liability of the EU shall in no case exceed the amount of the relevant budgetary commitment
made for it, thus excluding contingent liabilities for the budget. In practise it means that these liabilities
have a counter-part on the asset side of the balance sheet or are covered by the outstanding budgetary
commitments not yet expensed. The contingent liabilities above are shown net of financial provisions
made for these instruments – see note 2.10.

Fines

These amounts concern fines imposed by the Commission for infringement of competition rules that have
been provisionally paid by fined companies as foreseen in Article 90(1) rules of application of the FR and
where either an appeal has been lodged or where it is unknown if an appeal will be made. The contingent
liability will be maintained until a decision by the Court of Justice on the case is final or until the expiry of
the period for appeal. Interest earned on provisional payments is included in the economic result of the
year and also as a contingent liability to reflect the uncertainty of the Commission’s title to these
amounts.
Should the EU lose any of these cases relating to fines imposed, there would be no charge to the EU
budget since the fines have been provisionally paid and this cash is held either in specific bank accounts
(see note 2.8) or in the BUFI fund set up for this purpose (see note 2.4.1). The amount of fines are only
recognised as budgetary revenue when they are definitive (Article 83 FR).

Agriculture
These are contingent liabilities towards the Member States connected with the EAGF conformity
decisions, rural development and pre-accession financial corrections pending judgement of the Court of
Justice. The determination of the final amount of the liability and the year in which the effect of
successful appeals will be charged to the budget will depend on the length of the procedure before the
Court.

Cohesion
These are contingent liabilities towards the Member States in conjunction with actions under cohesion
policy awaiting the oral hearing date or pending judgement of the Court of Justice.

Other legal cases
This heading relates to actions for damages currently being brought against the EU, other legal disputes
and the estimated legal costs. It should be noted that in an action for damages under Article 288 EC the
applicant must demonstrate a sufficiently serious breach by the institution of a rule of law intended to
confer rights on individuals, real harm suffered by the applicant, and a direct causal link between the
unlawful act and the harm.

5.       BUDGETARY AND LEGAL COMMITMENTS
This note provides information on the budgetary process and future funding needs and not on liabilities
existing as at 31 December 2016.

The multiannual financial framework (MFF) agreed by the Member States, defines the programmes and
sets out the heading ceilings for commitment appropriations and the total for payment appropriations
within which the EU may enter into budgetary and legal commitments, and ultimately make payments for
a period of 7 years – see table 1.1 in the notes to the budgetary implementation reports.

The MFF ceilings were adopted by the Council (Member States), with the consent of the European
Parliament and Article 16 of Regulation 1306/2013 on the financing of the CAP makes a direct link
between the annual ceiling of EAGF expenditure and the MFF Regulation. The European Parliament and
the Council also adopted the respective basic acts for the EAGF expenditure that set out the expenditure
per Member State for the entire period 2014-2020.

Legal commitments correspond to programmes, projects, agreements or contracts signed, thus legally
binding the EU. A legal commitment is the act whereby the authorising officer enters or establishes an
obligation (for the EU) which results in a charge (Article 85 FR).

A budgetary commitment is in principle made before the legal commitment, but for some multiannual
programmes/projects it is the reverse, the relevant budgetary commitments being made in annual
instalments, over several years, when the basic act so provides for. For example, for cohesion, Article 76
of the Common Provisions Regulation (CPR) (Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013) provides that the decision
of the Commission adopting a programme shall constitute a legal commitment within the meaning of the
Financial Regulation but that the budget commitments of the Union in respect of each programme shall
be made in annual instalments for each Fund during the period between 1 January 2014 and
31 December 2020. Other legal bases may contain similar provisions. For this reason, there may be
amounts that the EU has legally committed to pay, but where the budgetary commitment has not yet
been made – see notes 5.2 and 5.3 below.

If the budgetary commitment has been made but the subsequent payments are not yet done, the
amount of outstanding commitment is called "Reste à Liquider" (RAL). This can represent programmes or
projects, often multiannual, signed but which are not yet (fully) implemented. They represent payment
obligations for future years. Part of the overall amounts unpaid (RAL) has already been expensed and is
recognised as a liability on the balance sheet (see notes 2.12 and 2.13). The calculation of these
expenses is made based on cost claims/invoices received and on the estimated implementation of a
programme or project where no claims have been notified yet to the EU – see note 5.1 below. Once the
payments relating to the RAL are made after 31 December 2016, the liability on the balance sheet is
derecognised. The part of the RAL not expensed yet is not included under liabilities but is instead
disclosed below.

The disclosures below thus represent amounts at 31 December 2016 that the EU has committed to pay
based on the fulfilment of the contractual agreements and which are therefore intended to be funded by
future EU budgets.

                                                                                            EUR millions

The amount disclosed above is the budgetary RAL ("Reste à Liquider") of EUR 238 759 million, less
related amounts that have been included as liabilities on the balance sheet and as expenses in the
statement of financial performance. The budgetary RAL is an amount representing the open
commitments for which payments and/or de-commitments have not yet been made. As explained above,
this is the normal consequence of the existence of multiannual programmes.

It should be noted that outstanding pre-financing advances at 31 December 2016 totalled
EUR 45.5 billion (see note 2.5). This represents budgetary commitments that have been paid, decreasing
the RAL, but where the amounts paid are still considered as belonging to the EU and not to the
beneficiary until the contractual commitments are fulfilled. They are thus like the RAL disclosed above,
not yet expensed.

These are legal obligations that the EU has committed to paying when adopting the operational
programmes related to shared management. The decision of the Commission adopting an operational
programme shall constitute a financing decision within the meaning of Article 84 FR and once notified to
the Member State concerned, a legal commitment within the meaning of that Regulation.

Article 76 of the CPR for European Structural and Investment Funds (ESIF) states:

"The budget commitments of the Union in respect of each programme shall be made in annual
instalments for each Fund during the period between 1 January 2014 and 31 December 2020. The budget
commitments relating to the performance reserve in each programme shall be made separately from the
remaining allocation to the programme."

The table above starts with the total MFF (column A) and shows the legal commitments for which budget
commitments have not yet been made and, for information, the maximum commitments in relation to
the ceilings foreseen in the MFF 2014-2020, headings 1B, 2 and 3. These legal commitments thus
represent the outstanding amounts for which the EU is committed to pay after 31 December 2016.

These amounts reflect the long-term legal commitments that were not yet covered by commitment
appropriations in the budget at year-end. These binding obligations will be budgeted in annual
instalments in future years and paid.

Certain important programmes (see below) may be implemented by annual instalments according to
Article 85(4) FR. This allows the EU to make legal commitments (sign grant agreements, delegation
agreements and procurement contracts) in excess of the available commitment appropriations of a given
year. Therefore a substantial amount of the overall allocation for the current MFF may be already
committed. This applies in particular for the following programmes:
   •   Connecting Europe Facility;
   •   Copernicus;
   •   ITER; and
   •   Galileo.


Connecting Europe Facility (CEF)
The CEF provides financial assistance to trans-European networks in order to support projects of common
interest in the sectors of transport, telecommunications and energy infrastructures. The legal
commitments for the CEF programme cover a period running from 2014 until 2020 for the CEF Transport
and up to 2021 for CEF Energy. The legal basis of these commitments is Regulation (EU) No 1316/2013
of the EP and of the Council of 11 December 2013 establishing the Connecting Europe Facility, amending
Regulation (EU) No 913/2010 and repealing Regulations (EC) No 680/2007 and (EC) No 67/2010 Text
with EEA relevance (OJ L 348, 20 December 2013) which foresees the use of the annual instalment in its
article 19.

Copernicus
Copernicus is the European Earth observation programme – see also note 2.2. These commitments are
made for the period until 2020. Based on Regulation (EU) 377/2014 of the EP and Council of 3 April 2014
(OJ L 122/44 of 24 April 2014) the Commission signed delegation agreements with the European Space
Agency (ESA), EUMETSAT and the European Centre for Medium Range weather forecasts. Article 8 of
Regulation 377/2014 authorises the use of annual instalments.

ITER – International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor

These commitments are intended to cover future funding needs of the ITER facilities up to 2021. The EU
(Euratom) contribution to ITER International is given through the Fusion for Energy Agency, including
also the contributions from Member States and from Switzerland. These commitments are made on the
basis of Council decision (Euratom) 791/2013 of 13 December 2013 amending decision (Euratom)
198/2007 establishing the European Joint Undertaking for ITER and the Development of Fusion Energy
which authorises the use of annual instalments. ITER was created to manage and to encourage the
exploitation of the ITER facilities, to promote public understanding and acceptance of fusion energy, and

to undertake any other activities that are necessary to achieve its purpose. ITER involves the EU, China,
India, Russia, South Korea, Japan and the USA.

Galileo
These are amounts committed to the Galileo programme developing a European Global Navigation
Satellite System – see also note 2.2. These commitments are made for the period until 2020. Based on
Regulation (EU) 1285/2013 of the EP and Council of 11 December 2013 (OJ L 347/1 of
20 December 2013) the Commission signed a delegation agreement with ESA. Article 9 of Regulation
(EU) 1285/2013 authorises the use of annual instalments.

Fisheries agreements
These are commitments entered into up to 2020 with third countries for operations under international
fisheries agreements. These commitments are made based on Council decisions for each third country
(e.g. Council decision (EU) 1894/2015 of 5 October 2015 on the conclusion of the Protocol between the
European Union and the Republic of Cape Verde setting out the fishing opportunities and the financial
contribution provided for in the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Community and
the Republic of Cape Verde; OJ L 277, 22 October 2015). These are specific international treaties which
imply multiannual rights and obligations.

Operating lease commitments

Minimum amounts committed to be paid according to the underlying contracts during the remaining term
of these lease contracts are as follows:

                                                                                           EUR millions

6.        FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT
The following disclosures with regard to the financial risk management of the EU relate to:

-    Borrowing and lending activities for financial assistance carried out by the Commission through:
     EFSM, BOP, MFA, and Euratom actions and the ECSC in Liquidation;

-    The treasury operations carried out by the Commission in order to implement the EU budget,
     including the receipt of fines;

-    Assets held in funds for budgetary guarantees: The Guarantee Fund for external actions and the EFSI
     Guarantee Fund; and

-    Financial instruments financed by the EU budget.

6.1.      TYPES OF RISK
Market risk is the risk that the fair value or future cashflows of a financial instrument will fluctuate,
because of variations in market prices. Market risk embodies not only the potential for loss, but also the
potential for gain. It comprises currency risk, interest rate risk and other price risk (the EU has no
significant other price risk).

(1) Currency risk is the risk that the EU's operations or its investments' value will be affected by changes
    in exchange rates. This risk arises from the change in price of one currency against another.

(2) Interest rate risk is the possibility of a reduction in the value of a security, especially a bond,
    resulting from an increase in interest rates. In general, higher interest rates will lead to lower prices
    of fixed rate bonds, and vice versa.

Credit risk is the risk of loss due to a debtor's/borrower's non-payment of a loan or other line of credit
(either the principal or interest or both) or other failure to meet a contractual obligation. The default
events include a delay in repayments, restructuring of borrower repayments and bankruptcy.

Liquidity risk is the risk that arises from the difficulty in selling an asset; for example, the risk that a
given security or asset cannot be traded quickly enough in the market to prevent a loss or meet an
obligation.


6.2.      RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES
The implementation of the EU budget relies increasingly on the use of operational programme financial
instruments. The basic concept behind this new approach, in contrast to the traditional method of budget
implementation by giving grants and subsidies, is that for each euro spent from the budget via financial
instruments, the final beneficiary receives more than EUR 1 as financial support due to the leverage
effect. This use of the EU budget maximises the impact of the funds available. For more information on
the amounts concerned, see note 2.4.1.

Common to most financial instruments is the fact that the implementation is delegated to either the EIB
group (including EIF) or to other financial institutions based on an agreement between the Commission
and the financial institution. Agreements signed with these financial institutions include strict conditions
and obligations on the intermediaries so as to ensure that EU monies are properly managed and properly
reported on. Once a financial contribution to one of the instruments has been committed, the funds are
transferred to a specifically created bank account of the financial institution (i.e. a fiduciary account). The
financial institution may, depending on the instrument in question, use the funds on this fiduciary account
to provide loans, issue debt instruments, invest in equity instruments or cover the guarantee calls.
Proceeds from financial instruments have, as a general rule, to be reimbursed to the EU budget.

The risk as regards these financial instruments is limited to a ceiling as indicated in the underlying
agreements, which is the budgeted amount foreseen for the instrument. As the Commission often bears
the "first loss piece" and since instruments are intended to finance riskier beneficiaries (who have
difficulties in obtaining funding from commercial lenders), it is therefore likely that some losses to the EU
budget will occur.

Measurement of financial instruments

The following classes of financial assets and liabilities are not measured at fair value: cash and cash
equivalents, loans, exchange receivables and non-exchange recoverables, borrowings and other financial
liabilities measured at amortised cost. The carrying amount of those financial assets and liabilities is
considered as a reasonable approximation of their fair value.


Borrowing and lending activities for financial assistance

The borrowing and lending transactions, as well as related treasury management, are carried out by the
EU according to the respective Council and EP Decisions, if applicable, and internal guidelines. Written
procedure manuals covering specific areas such as borrowings, loans and treasury management have
been developed and are used by the relevant operational units. As a general rule, there are no activities
to compensate interest rate variations or foreign currency variations ("hedging" activities) carried-out as
lending operations are generally financed by "back-to-back" borrowings, which thus do not generate open
interest rate or currency positions. The application of the "back-to-back" character is checked regularly.

Treasury

The rules and principles for the management of the Commission's treasury operations are laid down in
the Council Regulation 609/2014 (amended by Council Regulation 804/2016) and in the Financial
Regulation and its rules of application.

As a result of the above regulations, the following main principles apply:

-   Own resources are paid by the Member States into accounts opened for this purpose in the name of
    the Commission with the Treasury or national central bank. The Commission may draw on the above
    accounts solely to cover its cash requirements.

-   Own Resources are paid by Member States in their own national currencies, while the Commission's
    payments are mostly denominated in EUR.

-   Bank accounts opened in the name of the Commission may not be overdrawn. This restriction does
    not apply to the Commission's own resource accounts in case of a default on loans contracted or
    guaranteed pursuant to EU Council regulations and decisions and under certain conditions in case the
    cash resource requirements are in excess of the assets of the accounts.

-   Funds held in bank accounts denominated in currencies other than EUR are either used for payments
    in the same currencies or periodically converted in EUR.

In addition to the own resources accounts, other bank accounts are opened by the Commission, with
central banks and commercial banks, for the purpose of executing payments and receiving receipts other
than the Member State contributions to the budget.

Treasury and payment operations are highly automated and rely on modern information systems.
Specific procedures are applied to guarantee system security and to ensure segregation of duties in line
with the Financial Regulation, the Commission’s internal control standards, and audit principles.

A written set of guidelines and procedures regulates the management of the Commission's treasury and
payment operations with the objective of limiting operational and financial risk and ensuring an adequate
level of control. They cover the different areas of operation (for example: payment execution and cash
management, cashflow forecasting, business continuity, etc.), and compliance with the guidelines and
procedures is checked regularly. Additionally, information is exchanged between Directorate General for
the Budget and Directorate-General for Economic and Financial Affairs on risk management and best
practices.

Fines

Provisionally cashed fines: deposits

Amounts received before 2010 remain in bank accounts with banks specifically selected for the deposit of
provisionally cashed fines. The selection of banks is conducted in compliance with tender procedures
defined by the Financial Regulation. Placement of funds with specific banks is determined by the internal
risk management policy defining the credit rating requirements and the amount of funds which could be

                                                     78
-----------------------Page 80 End-----------------------

                                  Annual accounts of the European Union 2016

placed in proportion to the counterparty equity. Financial and operational risks are identified and
evaluated and compliance with internal policies and procedures is checked regularly.

Provisionally cashed fines: BUFI portfolio

Fines imposed and provisionally cashed from 2010 onwards are invested in a specifically created fund,
BUFI. The main objectives of the Fund are the reduction of risks associated with financial markets and
the equal treatment of all fined entities by offering a guaranteed return calculated on the same basis. The
asset management for provisionally cashed fines is carried out by the Commission in accordance with
internal asset management guidelines. Procedural manuals covering specific areas such as treasury
management have been developed and are used by the relevant operational units. Financial and
operational risks are identified and evaluated and compliance with internal guidelines and procedures is
checked regularly.

The objectives of the asset management activities are to invest the fines provisionally paid to the
Commission in such a way as to:

a) ensure that the funds are easily available when needed, while

b) aiming at delivering, under normal circumstances, a return which on average is in line with the return
   of the BUFI Benchmark minus costs incurred, while preserving the nominal amount of the fines.

Investments are restricted essentially to the following categories: term deposits with Euro-area Central
Banks, Euro-area sovereign debt agencies, fully state-owned or state-guaranteed banks or supranational
institutions, and bonds, bills and Certificates of Deposit issued by either sovereign or supranational
institutions.

Bank guarantees

Significant amounts of guarantees issued by financial institutions are held by the Commission in relation
to the fines it imposes on companies breaching EU competition rules (see note 2.6.1.2). These
guarantees are provided by fined companies as an alternative to making provisional payments. The
guarantees are managed in compliance with the internal risk management policy. Financial and
operational risks are identified and evaluated and compliance with internal policies and procedures is
checked regularly.

Guarantee Fund for external actions

The rules and principles for the asset management of the Guarantee Fund are laid out in the Convention
between the Commission and the EIB dated 25 November 1994 and the subsequent amendments dated
17/23 September 1996, 8 May 2002, 25 February 2008 and 9 November 2010. This Guarantee Fund
operates only in euros. It exclusively invests in this currency in order to avoid any foreign currency risk.
Management of the assets is based upon the traditional rules of prudence adhered to for financial
activities. It is required to pay particular attention to reducing the risks and to ensuring that the managed
assets can be sold or transferred without significant delay, taking into account the commitments covered.

EFSI Guarantee Fund

The EFSI Guarantee Fund was established by Regulation (EU) 2015/1017 of the European Parliament and
of the Council of 25 June 2015. The rules and principles for the asset management of the Fund are laid
out in the Commission Decision C(2016)165 of 21 January 2016. The managed assets shall provide
sufficient liquidity in relation to the potential guarantee calls, while still aiming at optimising the return
and risk level that is compatible with maintaining a high degree of security and stability.

Borrowing and lending activities for financial assistance

Most financial assets and liabilities are in EUR, so in these cases the EU has no foreign currency risk.
However, the EU does give loans in USD through the financial instrument Euratom, which are financed by
borrowings with an equivalent amount in USD (back-to-back operation). At the balance sheet date the EU
has no foreign currency risk with regard to Euratom.

Treasury

Own resources paid by Member States in currencies other than EUR are kept on the own resources
accounts, in accordance with the Own Resources Regulation. They are converted into EUR when they are
needed to cover for the execution of payments. The procedures applied for the management of these
funds are dictated by the above referenced regulation. In a limited number of cases, these funds are
directly used for payments to be executed in the same currencies.

A number of accounts in EU currencies other than EUR, and in USD and CHF, are held by the Commission
with commercial banks, for the purpose of executing payments denominated in these same currencies.
These accounts are replenished depending on the amount of payments to be executed, as a consequence
their balances do not represent exposure to currency risk.

When miscellaneous receipts (other than own resources) are received in currencies other than EUR, they
are either transferred to Commission's accounts held in the same currencies, if they are needed to cover
the execution of payments, or converted into EUR and transferred to accounts held in EUR. Imprest
accounts held in currencies other than EUR are replenished depending on the estimated short term local
payments needs in the same currencies. Balances on these accounts are kept within their respective
ceilings.

Fines

Provisionally cashed fines (deposits and BUFI portfolio) and bank guarantees

Since all fines are imposed and paid in EUR, there is no foreign currency risk.

Guarantee Fund for external actions

The financial assets of this fund are in EUR so there is no currency risk. The loans subrogated to the EU
as result of calls on the Fund following payment defaults by a loan beneficiary are carried out in their
original currency and therefore expose the EU to currency risk. There are no activities to compensate
foreign currency variations ("hedging" activities) due to uncertainty relating to the loans repayment
timing.

EFSI Guarantee Fund

The EFSI Guarantee Fund currently operates in both EUR and USD. In December 2016 the first
investments in USD denominated fixed-rate debt securities (US Treasuries) were undertaken with a view
to improve returns and diversify market risk through exposure to the US market. Currency risk is
managed through entering into derivative contracts (foreign exchange forward contracts) hedging the
market value of the USD investments portfolio. The limit for maximum unhedged foreign exchange

-----------------------Page 83 End-----------------------

                                  Annual accounts of the European Union 2016

exposure is set at 1 % of the total portfolio value within the benchmark and annual strategy allocations.
Thus, upward or downward movements in the USD investments' market value above or below the 1 %
limit would trigger a rebalancing trade (a new forward contract with the same or opposite direction),
adjusting or reversing the hedged position accordingly. Readjustment of the hedge may also be prompted
by movements of the EUR/USD exchange rate.

Borrowing and lending activities for financial assistance

Due to the nature of its borrowing and lending activities, the EU has significant interest-bearing assets
and liabilities. However, the interest rate risks that arise from borrowings are offset by equivalent loans
in terms and conditions (back-to-back).

Treasury

The Commission's treasury does not borrow money; so as a consequence, it is not exposed to interest
rate risk. Interest is however calculated on balances held on the different bank accounts. The
Commission has therefore put in place measures to ensure that interest earned on its bank accounts
regularly reflects market interest rates, as well as their possible fluctuation.

Accounts opened with Member States Treasuries for own resources receipts are non-interest bearing and
free of charges. Accounts held with National Central Banks may be remunerated at the official rates
applied by each institution. As some of the remunerations applied to these accounts may currently be
negative, cash management procedures are in place to minimise balances kept on these accounts.

In addition, own resources accounts are protected from any impact of negative interest in accordance
with Council Regulation 804/2016.

Overnight balances held on commercial bank accounts earn interest on a daily basis. This is based on
variable market rates to which a contractual margin (positive or negative) is applied. The rates applied by
commercial banks are in general contractually floored at zero. As a result no risk exists that the
Commission earns interest at rates lower than market rates.

Fines

Provisionally cashed fines (deposits, BUFI portfolio) and bank guarantees

Interest earned on deposits have a limited exposure to interest rate risk due to a duration of less than
one year. The rest of the portfolio is invested in securities with an average duration of 2.6 years.

Guarantee Fund for external actions

The budget provisioned in the Guarantee Fund is invested in a portfolio of money market instruments and
long term bonds with a total average portfolio duration of 3.59 years.

Receivables and recoverables between 1 and 5 years include recoverables related to competition fines of
EUR 870 million that are to a large extent covered by bank guarantees and the Commission has thus low
exposure to a credit risk. These guarantees are provided by fined companies as an alternative to making
provisional payments.

* Available for sale financial assets (excluding equity instruments and Unitary Fund).
** Financial assets at fair value through surplus or deficit.


Not included in the above table are available for sale financial assets in the form of equity instruments
without external credit rating. The four risk categories mentioned above are in principle based on the
rating categories of external rating agencies and correspond to:

     •    Prime and high grade: Moody P-1, Aaa – Aa3; S&P A-1+, A-1, AAA – AA -; Fitch F1+, F1, AAA –
          AA- and equivalent
     •    Upper medium grade: Moody P-2, A1 – A3; S&P A-2, A+ - A-; Fitch F2, A+ - A- and equivalent
     •    Lower medium grade: Moody P-3, Baa1 – Baa3, S&P A-3, BBB+ - BBB-; Fitch F-3, BBBB+ - BBB-
          and equivalent
     •    Non-investment grade: Moody not prime, Ba1 – C; S&P B, C, BB+ - D; Fitch B, C, BB+ - D and
          equivalent

The EU uses these external agencies rating categories as a reference point notably for financial
instruments and commercial banks, but may, after making its own analysis of individual cases, keep
amounts in one of the above risk categories even though one or more of the above mentioned rating
agencies may have downgraded the corresponding counterparty. As regards non-rated counterparties,
group 1 relates to debtors without defaults in the past and group 2 relates to debtors with defaults in the
past.

The amounts displayed above under loans and receivables categorised in non-investment grade relate
primarily to financial support loans disbursed by the Commission to Member States in financial difficulties
and recoverables against certain Members States based on own resources regulations or other legal
basis. The amount under cash relates to own resources bank accounts opened in the Treasury or in the
central banks of Member States to hold the own resources contributions as foreseen in the regulation.
The Commission may draw on these accounts solely to cover cash requirements arising from execution of
the budget.

Borrowing and lending activities for financial assistance

Exposure to credit risk is managed firstly by obtaining country guarantees in the case of Euratom, then
through the Guarantee Fund for external actions (MFA & Euratom), then by the possibility of drawing the
necessary funds from the Commission's own resources accounts with the Member States and ultimately
through the Budget of the EU.

The Own Resources legislation fixes the ceiling for own resources payments at 1.20 % of Member States'
GNI and during 2016 0.89 % was actually used to cover payment appropriations. This means that at
31 December 2016 there existed an available margin of 0.31 % to cover these guarantees. To this end,
the EU is entitled to call upon all the Member States to ensure compliance with the EU's legal obligation
towards its lenders.




                                                                 84
-----------------------Page 86 End-----------------------

                                 Annual accounts of the European Union 2016

Treasury

Most of the Commission's treasury resources are kept, in accordance with Council Regulation
No 609/2014 on own resources, in the accounts opened by Member States for the payment of their
contributions (own resources). All such accounts are held with Member States' treasuries or national
central banks. These institutions carry the lowest credit (or counterparty) risk for the Commission as the
exposure is with its Member States. For the part of the Commission's treasury resources kept with
commercial banks, in order to cover the execution of payments, replenishment of these accounts is made
on a just-in-time basis and is automatically managed by the treasury cash management system.
Minimum cash levels, which take into account the average amount of daily payments executed from it,
are kept on each account. As a consequence the total amount kept overnight on these accounts remains
constantly at low levels (overall less than EUR 100 million on average, spread over 20 accounts) and so
ensure the Commission's risk exposure is limited. These amounts should be viewed with regard to the
daily overall treasury balances which fluctuated in 2016 between EUR 1 billion and EUR 30 billion, and
with an overall amount of payments made from Commission accounts in 2016 that exceeds
EUR 145 billion.

In addition, specific guidelines are applied for the selection of commercial banks in order to further
minimise counterparty risk to which the Commission is exposed:

-   All commercial banks are selected by call for tenders. The minimum short term credit rating required
    for admission to the tendering procedures is Moody's P-1 or equivalent. A lower level may be
    accepted in specific and duly justified circumstances.

-   The credit ratings of the commercial banks where the Commission has accounts are monitored on a
    daily basis.

-   In delegations outside the EU, imprest accounts are held with local banks selected by a simplified
    tendering procedure. Rating requirements depend on the local situation and may significantly differ
    from one country to another. In order to limit risk exposure, balances on these accounts are kept at
    the lowest possible levels (taking into account operational needs), they are regularly replenished, and
    the applied ceilings are reviewed on a yearly basis.

Fines

Provisionally cashed fines: deposits

Banks holding deposits for the fines provisionally cashed before 2010 are selected by tender procedure in
compliance with the risk management policy which defines the credit rating requirements and the amount
of funds which could be placed in proportion to the counterparty equity.

For commercial banks that have been specifically selected for the deposit of provisionally cashed fines, a
minimum long-term rating A (S&P or equivalent) and a minimum short term rating A-1 (S&P or
equivalent) is required as a general rule. Specific measures are applied in case banks in this group are
subject to downgrade. In addition, the amount deposited with each bank is limited to a certain
percentage of its own funds, which varies depending on the rating level of each institution. The
calculation of such limits also takes into account the amount of outstanding guarantees issued to the
Commission by the same institution. The compliance of outstanding deposits with the applicable policy
requirements is reviewed regularly.

Provisionally cashed fines: BUFI portfolio

For sovereign debt investments from provisionally cashed fines imposed as from 2010, the Commission
takes on the exposure to credit risk. The highest concentration of exposure is towards France, which
represents 31 % of the total nominal volume of the portfolio. The five countries with the highest
exposure (France, Italy, Belgium, Germany and Luxembourg) represent altogether 77 % of the
investment portfolio. The weighted average credit rating of the portfolio is A (S&P or equivalent).

Bank guarantees

The risk management policy applied for the acceptance of such guarantees ensures a high credit quality
for the Commission. The compliance of the outstanding guarantees with the applicable policy
requirements is reviewed regularly.

Guarantee Fund for external actions

The treasury portfolio’s agreed asset management guidelines and/or investment strategy define certain
limits and restrictions in order to limit the exposure to credit risk of the portfolio. Such limits and
restrictions include eligibility criteria, absolute credit limits in nominal terms depending on issuer
category, relative concentration limits depending on issuer category and concentration limits per issue.
All investments are rated at least investment grade.

EFSI Guarantee Fund

The asset management guidelines, risk and investment strategies define certain limits and restrictions in
order to limit the exposure to credit risk of the portfolio which is generally limited to investment grade.
The weighted average credit rating of the portfolio is A (S&P or equivalent).

As the sole counterparty for all outstanding currency forwards as of 31 December 2016 is the Bank for
International Settlements (BIS), no credit enhancements, such as collateral, netting agreements, or
guarantees are put in place as of this date. The maximum exposure to credit risk for foreign exchange
derivatives having a positive fair value at the end of the reporting period is equal to the carrying amount
on the balance sheet.

Borrowing and lending activities for financial assistance

The liquidity risk that arises from borrowings is generally offset by equivalent loans in terms and
conditions (back-to-back operations). For MFA and Euratom, the Guarantee Fund for external actions
serves as a liquidity reserve (or safety net) in case of payment default and payment delays of borrowers.
For BOP, the Council Regulation 431/2009 provides for a procedure allowing sufficient time to mobilise
funds through the Commission's own resources accounts with the Member States. For EFSM, the Council
Regulation 407/2010 provides for a similar procedure.

Treasury

EU budget principles ensure that overall cash resources for a given year are always sufficient for the
execution of all payments. In fact, the total Member States contributions equal the amount of payment
appropriations for the budgetary year. Member States’ contributions, however, are received in twelve
monthly instalments throughout the year, while payments are subject to certain seasonality. Moreover, in
accordance with the Council Regulation 609/2014 (on the methods and procedure for making available
own resources), Member States contributions relating to (amending) budgets approved after the 16th of
a given month (N) only become available in month N+2, while the related payment appropriations are

                                 Annual accounts of the European Union 2016

immediately available. In order to ensure that available treasury resources are always sufficient to cover
the payments to be executed in any given month, procedures regarding regular cash forecasting are in
place, and own resources or additional funding can be called up in advance from Member States if
needed, up to certain limits and under certain conditions. Seasonality of expenditure and overall
budgetary restrictions in recent years have resulted in the need for increased monitoring of the rhythm of
payments over the year. In addition to the above, in the context of the Commission's daily treasury
operations, automated cash management tools ensure that sufficient liquidity is available on each of the
Commission's bank accounts, on a daily basis.

The fund is managed according to the principle that the assets shall have a sufficient degree of liquidity
and mobilisation in relation to the relevant commitments. The portfolio is composed of mostly highly
liquid securities that can be sold to meet unexpected cash outflows. In addition the share of securities
maturing within 1 year and floating rate notes is 33 %.

Guarantee Fund for external actions

The fund is managed according to the principle that the assets shall have a sufficient degree of liquidity
and mobilisation in relation to the relevant commitments. The fund must maintain a minimum of
EUR 100 million in a portfolio with a maturity of less than twelve months which is to be invested in
monetary instruments. As at 31 December 2016 these investments, including cash, amounted to
EUR 197 million. Furthermore, a minimum of 20 % of the fund's nominal value shall comprise monetary
instruments, fixed-rate bonds with a remaining maturity of no more than one year, and floating-rate
bonds. As at 31 December 2016 this ratio stood at 20 %.

EFSI Guarantee Fund

The Guarantee Fund is managed according to the principle that the assets shall have a sufficient degree
of liquidity and mobilisation in relation to the relevant commitments. The portfolio is composed of highly
liquid assets that can be sold to meet unexpected cash outflows, including the most liquid USD-
denominated assets – US Treasuries, standing at 15 % of the total investment portfolio as of the
reporting date. In addition, the share of securities maturing within 1 year and floating rate notes is 23 %.

The settlement of derivative contracts is gross and is based on their contractual maturity. Obligations are
honoured via sales of USD-denominated assets and / or a swap transaction, whereby it is possible that a
cash outflow arises due to foreign exchange differences.

No liquidity management is necessary with regard to collateral / margin requirements as the current
hedging counterparty accepts to operate with the Commission without any requirements for collateral /
margin calls.

8.       EVENTS AFTER THE BALANCE SHEET DATE
At the date of signing of these accounts, except for the matter outlined below, no material issues had
come to the attention of or were reported to the Accounting Officer of the Commission that would require
separate disclosure under this section. The accounts and related notes were prepared using the most
recently available information and this is reflected in the information presented.

On 29 March 2017 the United Kingdom formally announced its intention to leave the European Union,
thus activating Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with this article as well as the
European Council guidelines on the financial agreement and negotiating directives provided by the
Council, the EU shall conclude an agreement with the United Kingdom, setting out the arrangements for
its withdrawal. At the time of the signing of these accounts, the negotiation process has just begun and
there is no impact on the financial position of the EU at 31 December 2016.

            THE EU: FINANCIAL SITUATION 2016

     1.1.       REVENUE

The majority of revenue of the EU institutions and bodies are revenues from non-exchange transactions.
The table below provides an overview of the main categories of these revenues.

The main points to note regarding the movement in revenue from non-exchange transactions as
compared to 2015 are:

     •   a decrease of VAT revenue of EUR 2.5 billion mainly due to the reduced call rate of 0.15 % for
         Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden, which was applicable following the entry into force of the
         own resource decision (ORD) 2014 in 2016; and

     •   a significant increase in revenues from competition fines of EUR 3.3 billion mainly due to fines
         imposed in 2016 in the truck and banking sectors.

Recovery of expenses represent recovery orders issued by the Commission that are cashed or offset
against subsequent payments recorded in the Commissions accounting system made so as to recover
expenditure previously paid out from the EU budget.


     1.2.       EXPENSES

Expenses were, being EUR 144.5 billion, at a much lower level than last year (2015: EUR 155.9 billion). A
decrease of EUR 3.7 billion was noted for the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and Cohesion
Fund (CF), which was due to less expenses incurred relating to the previous programming period (2007-
2013) combined with the slow start of the implementation of the programming period 2014-2020. For the

same reason expenses under European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) and other rural
development instruments also decreased by EUR 3.7 billion.

The main expense items (EUR 102.8 billion) are transfer payments under the shared management mode.
The main funds are: the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund (EAGF), the EAFRD and other rural
development instruments, ERDF and CF and the European Social Fund (ESF). In the financial year 2016
these made up almost 71.1 % of total expenses.

Expenses incurred under direct management represent the budget implementation by the Commission,
executive agencies and by trust funds. Also included under direct management are administrative
expenses of all EU institutions and agencies. Under indirect management the budget is implemented by
EU agencies, EU bodies, third countries, international organisations and other entities. Overall, the
expenses incurred under direct and indirect management made up about 16.2 % of total expenses
(EUR 23.4 billion) and remained stable as compared to the previous financial year.

The EU also recognises future payment obligations as expenses that are not yet shown in the cash-based
budgetary accounts. They are in particular shown under payables and accrued charges for agriculture and
rural development and under pension and employee benefits liabilities relating to pension rights acquired
by Commissioners, MEPs and staff and lead to negative net assets (these payments will be financed by
future budgets).

                                 Annual accounts of the European Union 2016

The most significant items on the asset side of the balance sheet are financial assets (loans, available for
sale financial assets, cash) and pre-financing amounts, which make up almost 84 % of the assets of the
EU. The amount of loans fell by EUR 1.8 billion to EUR 55.5 billion whereas the amount of available for
sale financial instruments financed from the EU budget (budgetary instruments) increased again by about
EUR 455 million (2015: EUR 460 million). Included on the asset side under 'Space assets' are assets
concerning the Copernicus and Galileo programme (EUR 3.3 billion). Assets relating to Galileo have been
moved from assets under construction to fixed assets following the declaration of the Galileo initial
services on 15 December 2016.

In general, the EU institutions and bodies strive to keep the amounts held as cash and cash equivalents
at a low level. The high cash balance of EUR 28.6 billion at year-end is due to the following main
elements:
    •   As regards own resources, the end of year balance includes a total net amount of EUR 7.7 billion
        to be returned to Member States in early 2017 as result of amending budgets adopted late in
        2016. In addition, advances on own resources amounting to EUR 1.5 billion were received in the
        final days of 2016.
    •   A significant amount of fines imposed by the Commission for breach of competition rules of
        EUR 4.3 billion were definitively cashed in 2016 and are part of the year-end treasury balance.
    •   The treasury balance also includes the assigned revenue and payment appropriations not spent
        by the end of 2016 of EUR 11 billion.

Pre-financing

It should be noted that the level of pre-financing is significantly influenced by the MFF cycle – for
example at the beginning of an MFF period one can expect large advances to be paid to Member States
under cohesion policy. The Commission makes every effort to ensure that the levels of pre-financing are
maintained at an appropriate level. A balance has to be struck between ensuring sufficient funding for the
projects and the timely recognition of expenditure.
The total pre-financing (excluding other advances to Member States and contributions to the trust funds
Bekou and Africa) on the EU balance sheet amounts to EUR 41.6 billion (2015: EUR 40 billion), almost all
of which relates to Commission activities. Some 64 % of the Commission's pre-financing concerns shared
management, which means that the implementation of the budget is delegated to Member States (the
Commission retains a supervisory role).

The most significant pre-financing amount under shared management mode relates to ERDF & CF
(EUR 15.1 billion).
Long-term pre-financing has decreased by EUR 8.3 billion while short-term pre-financing increased by
EUR 9.9 billion. This movement of pre-financing amounts is due to the fact that the programming period
2007-2013 is in its closing phase and thus more amounts become due within twelve months. Concerning
the programming period 2014-2020, the initial pre-financing paid is booked as non-current, while the
annual pre-financing is booked as current.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The following items are shown in accounting terms as financial instruments in the consolidated financial
statements of the EU:
    •    Financial Instruments financed by the EU budget;
    •    Financial assets held in guarantee funds for budgetary guarantees; and
    •    Loans and related borrowings for financial assistance programmes.

Financial instruments financed by the EU budget

The significance and volume of financial instruments financed by the EU budget under direct and indirect
management increases from year to year. The basic concept behind this approach, in contrast to the
traditional method of budget implementation by giving grants and subsidies, is that for each euro spent
from the budget via financial instruments, the final beneficiary receives more than EUR 1 as financial
support due to the leverage effect. This use of the EU budget aims at maximising the impact of the funds
available. Financial instruments financed by the EU budget exist in the form of guarantee instruments,
equity instruments and loan instruments - see the overview by MFF below. Assets held in these
instruments are either kept in cash and cash equivalents or invested in equity instruments and debt
securities shown as available for sale financial assets in the consolidated financial statements of the EU.

Financial assets held in guarantee funds for budgetary guarantees
The Commission has set-up guarantee funds to cover budgetary guarantees (see note 4.1.1 of the
consolidated financial statements) given to the EIB group. These guarantee funds are provisioned by
payments from the EU budget so as to provide a liquidity cushion against potential losses from
guaranteed operations. Payments to the guarantee funds are invested in financial instruments including
debt securities, cash and term deposits. At 31 December 2016, the Commission holds financial assets in
the:

     •    Guarantee Fund for external actions of EUR 2.3 billion; and

     •    EFSI Guarantee Fund of EUR 1 billion.

The EFSI Guarantee Fund started its operations in 2016.


Loans and related borrowings for financial assistance programmes

The EU is empowered by the EU Treaty to undertake borrowing operations to mobilise the financial
resources necessary to fulfil specific mandates. The Commission, acting on behalf of the EU, currently
operates three main programmes: European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism (EFSM), the Balance of
Payments (BOP) assistance and the Macro-financial assistance (MFA), under which it may grant loans.
The capital required to fund the EU lending is raised on the capital markets or with financial institutions.

The MFA loans are granted to partner countries outside the EU, outstanding loans at 31 December 2016
total EUR 2 947 million at nominal amounts.

EFSM

In 2014 the Irish and the Portuguese financial assistance programmes under EFSM expired and thus no
additional loans can be drawn. In January 2016, Portugal officially requested for the extension of its first
EFSM loan repayment maturity due on 3 June 2016. The EUR 4.75 billion instalment was refinanced by
three new tranches of EUR 1.5 billion, EUR 2.25 billion and EUR 1 billion, with maturities falling in 2023,
2031 and 2036, respectively. This is the main reason for the decrease of short-term loans/borrowings
and an increase of long-term loans/borrowings on the 2016 balance sheet.

BOP

The BOP assistance programme for Hungary expired in 2010 and both assistance programmes for Latvia
and Romania expired in 2012. Additionally, the two precautionary assistance programmes for Romania
expired in 2013 and 2015 respectively without being drawn down. In April 2016, Hungary reimbursed its
last outstanding instalment of EUR 1.5 billion.

EUR 235 billion liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet of the EU

                                                                   Pension & other employee benefits

                                                                   Payables

                                                                   Accrued charges & deferred income

The liability side consists primarily of four key items: The pension and other employee benefits liabilities,
borrowings, payables and accrued charges. The biggest change as compared to 2015 is the increase of
payables by almost EUR 8 billion mainly due to a better implementation of EAGF (i.e. the payments at the
level member states) in 2016 compared to 2015 – see note 2.12 of the consolidated financial
statements.

Net assets

The excess of liabilities over assets does not mean that the EU institutions and bodies are in financial
difficulties, rather it means that certain liabilities will be funded by future annual budgets. Many expenses
are recognised under accrual accounting rules in 2016 although they may be actually paid in 2017 or
later and funded using future budgets and the related revenues will only be accounted for in future
periods. The most significant amounts to be highlighted are the EAGF activities (paid in 2017) and the
employee benefits liability (to be paid over the next 30 plus years).

2.         PROTECTION OF THE EU BUDGET
Financial corrections and recoveries overview for 2016

An important consideration in implementing the EU budget is the need to ensure the proper prevention or
detection and subsequent correction of system weaknesses leading to errors, irregularities and fraud. The
Court provides in its annual report a statement of assurance on the legality and regularity of transactions
underlying the annual accounts, as well as the material level of error in payments. The statement of
assurance accompanies the EU annual accounts in its publication in the Official Journal.

The Commission's protective actions mitigate the impact of these errors through two main mechanisms:
     (1) preventive mechanisms (e.g. ex-ante controls, interruptions and suspensions of payments);
         and
     (2) corrective mechanisms (primarily financial corrections imposed on or agreed with Member
         States and, to a lesser extent, recoveries from recipients of EU payments).

Under the shared management mode (agricultural spending and structural actions), Member States are
primarily responsible throughout the expenditure life cycle for ensuring that expenditure paid out from
the EU budget is legal and regular.

The corrective actions, i.e. financial corrections and recoveries, arise following the supervision and checks
made by both the Commission and also, in the case of shared management expenditure, Member States
on the eligibility of expenditure funded by the EU budget. When deciding on the amount of a financial
correction or recovery, the Commission takes into account the nature and seriousness of the breach of
applicable law and the financial implications for the EU budget, including cases of deficiencies in
management and control systems. Most corrections are done after payment.

Financial corrections and recoveries process:


           Ex-post controls
                                           In progress             Confirmed                  Implemented
              and audits

Financial corrections and recoveries are presented at two main stages of the process. Both stages may
take place in the same year or in different years:
      (1) Financial corrections and recoveries at confirmation stage: These amounts have been either
      agreed by the Member State concerned or adopted by a Commission decision. In 2016, the total
      financial corrections and recoveries confirmed amounted to EUR 3 777 million (2015:
      EUR 3 499 million).

       (2) Financial corrections and recoveries at implementation stage: These amounts represent the
       final step of the process whereby the observed situation of undue expenditure is definitively
       corrected. Several implementation mechanisms are foreseen in the sector-based regulatory
       frameworks. In 2016, the total financial corrections and recoveries implemented amounted to
       EUR 3 389 million (2015: EUR 3 853 million). The implementation of financial corrections and
       recoveries may take a number of years mainly due to instalment or deferral decisions granted to
       Member States under the agricultural policy. Under the Cohesion policy the legal framework
       foresees the implementation at or after the closure of the programming period.

3.          MANAGEMENT OF RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES
            IN EU BUDGET IMPLEMENTATION

     3.1.        MACRO-ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT

The macro-economic environment of the EU7 has an impact on the ability of EU Member states to meet
their funding obligations towards the EU institutions and bodies and thus on the ability of the EU to
continue implementing EU policies.

There is a high degree of uncertainty surrounding the global economic outlook at present. This comes
after an already difficult 2016, in which the European economy had to cope with numerous international
and domestic challenges including the lowest pace of global and trade growth since 2009, geopolitical
tensions, terrorist attacks in several Member States, stressed banking sectors, UK's vote to leave the EU,
and a mounting backlash against globalisation. So far though, the European economy has proved to be
resilient and has stayed the course of economic growth and job creation. EU GDP growth rose towards
the end of 2016 and looks to have maintained its momentum into 2017. This resilience has been
supported by a number of well-known favourable factors, including the relatively low oil price, the past
depreciation of the euro, accommodative monetary policies and a broadly neutral fiscal policy stance. The
implementation of structural reforms in some Member States has also helped to underpin the recovery,
particularly in the labour market. Private consumption has remained the main growth driver while
investment has continued to disappoint. This persistent weakness in investment casts a shadow of doubt
over the sustainability of the recovery and the economy's potential growth. Uncertainty is rising to an
extraordinarily high level, driven by the uncertain outcome of the UK's decision to withdraw from the EU.

Overall, after 1.7 % in 2016, euro area GDP growth is set to ease somewhat this year to 1.6 % and then
pick up slightly to 1.8 % in 2018. This steady but moderate expansion should remain driven by domestic

demand. Global GDP growth is expected to have reached a low point in 2016 and is projected to
strengthen this year and next. Growth outside the EU is projected to pick up gradually from 3.2 % in
2016 to 3.7 % in 2017 and 3.9 % in 2018.




    3.2.        BUDGETARY CONTINGENT LIABILITIES FOR
                FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE

The EU borrowing and lending activities for financial assistance programmes are non-budget operations.
In general, funds raised are on-lent back-to-back to the beneficiary country, i.e. with the same coupon,
maturity and amount. Notwithstanding the back-to-back methodology, the debt service of the funding
instruments is a legal obligation of the EU, which will ensure that all payments are made fully and in a
timely manner. The Commission has put procedures in place to ensure the repayment of borrowings even
in case of a loan default.

Borrowings of the EU constitute direct and unconditional obligations of the EU and are guaranteed by the
EU Member States (budgetary contingent liabilities). Borrowings undertaken to fund loans to countries
outside the EU are covered by the Guarantee Fund for external actions. Should a beneficiary Member
State default, the debt service will be drawn from the available treasury balance of the Commission, if
possible. If that would not be possible, the Commission would draw the necessary funds from the
Member States. EU Member States are legally obliged, according to the EU own resources legislation
(Article 14 of Council Regulation 609/2014), to make available sufficient funds to meet the EU’s
obligations. Thus investors are only exposed to the credit risk of the EU, not to that of the beneficiary of
loans funded. “Back-to-back” lending ensures that the EU budget does not assume any interest rate or
foreign exchange risk.

For each country programme, the EP, the Council and the Commission decisions determine the overall
granted amount, the number of instalments to be disbursed, and the maximum (average) maturity of the
loan package. Subsequently, the Commission and the beneficiary country agree the loan/funding
parameters, in particular the maturity of instalments. In addition, except for the first one, all instalments
of the loan depend on compliance with policy conditions, in the context of a joint EU / International
Monetary Fund (IMF) financial assistance, which is another factor influencing the timing of funding
operations. This implies that the timing and maturities of issuances are dependent on the related EU
lending activity. Funding is exclusively denominated in euro and the maturity spectrum is from 3 to 30
years.

    3.3.       CONTINGENT LIABILITIES RELATING TO
               BUDGETARY GUARANTEES

The EU has given guarantees to the EIB Group on loans granted outside of the EU and on debt and equity
operations covered by the EFSI guarantee. At 31 December 2016, the EU shows in the notes to its
consolidated financial statements (see note 4.1.1) contingent liabilities for both guarantees. In order to
mitigate the risk guarantee calls by the EIB Group could have on the EU budget, the EU has created
dedicated guarantee funds, i.e. the Guarantee Fund for external actions and the EFSI Guarantee Fund.

The Guarantee Fund for external actions is provisioned by the EU budget so as to cover 9 % of the
guaranteed loans for EIB external lending mandate activities to third countries outstanding at year-end.
At 31 December 2016 the total asset value of EUR 2.3 billion covers an exposure of amounts disbursed of
EUR 19.8 billion, of amounts signed of EUR 28.8 billion for a ceiling of EUR 39.3 billion.

The EFSI Guarantee Fund started its activities in 2016 and will gradually reach EUR 8 billion by 2022,
thus provisioning 50 % of the maximum exposure of the EU guarantee of EUR 16 billion. An amount of
EUR 1 billion was provisioned to the EFSI Guarantee Fund in 2016 and EUR 4.4 billion of guaranteed
amounts have been disbursed and EUR 11.2 billion have in total been signed (thus including amounts
disbursed).

     3.4.         MANAGING THE REFUGEE CRISIS – FACILITY FOR
                  REFUGEES IN TURKEY

The EU faces an unprecedented crisis which requires solidarity, togetherness and efficiency. Challenges
are common and responses need to be coordinated. Turkey’s geographical position makes it a prominent
reception and transit country for many refugees and migrants. As a result of an unprecedented influx
mainly due to the Syria conflict, the country has been hosting the highest number of refugees and
migrants in the world.

In 2015, the EU and its Member States decided to step up their political and financial engagement to
support Turkey in its efforts in hosting refugees. Comprehensive cooperation based on shared
responsibility, mutual commitments and delivery between the EU and Turkey was agreed upon within the
framework of the 29 November 2015 EU-Turkey Statement. The summit of 29 November 2015 activated
the EU-Turkey Joint Action Plan (JAP) to help Turkey address the consequences of the Syria conflict.

In answer to the call from EU Member States for significant additional funding to support refugees in
Turkey, the Commission established the Facility for Refugees in Turkey by means of the Commission
Decision of 24 November 2015, amended on 10 February 20168. The Facility is a mechanism to
coordinate the mobilisation of resources made available under both the EU budget and additional
contributions from Member States integrated into the EU budget as external assigned revenue amounting
to a total of EUR 3 billion for the period 2016-2017. Member States committed politically to providing
national contributions in the framework of the Common Understanding between EU Member States and
the European Commission which was adopted by the representatives of the governments of the Member
States on 3 February 2016. The Common Understanding also establishes a conditionality framework. The
EUR 3 billion is made available in addition to EUR 345 million already allocated by the Commission to
Turkey in response to the Syrian refugee crisis before the start of the Facility and is additional to Member
States' bilateral aid.

The Facility became operational on 17 February 2016 with the first meeting of the Facility Steering
Committee. The Facility for Refugees in Turkey is a coordinating mechanism that allows for the swift,
effective and efficient mobilisation of EU assistance to refugees in Turkey. The Facility ensures the
optimal mobilisation of relevant existing EU financing instruments, either as humanitarian assistance or
non-humanitarian assistance, to ensure that the needs of refugees and host communities are addressed
in a comprehensive and coordinated manner.

The Steering Committee of the Facility provides strategic guidance on the overall priorities, the type of
actions to be supported, the amounts to be allocated and the financing instruments to be mobilised, as
well as, when appropriate, on the conditions relating to the implementation by Turkey of its commitments
under the EU-Turkey Joint Action Plan. The Steering Committee is chaired by the Commission and
composed of two representatives of the Commission and one representative of each Member State with
Turkey sitting in an advisory capacity.

In line with Article 3(2) of the Commission Decision establishing the Facility, the second Steering
Committee of 12 May 2016 agreed that the Facility should focus on six priority areas: (1) humanitarian
assistance, (2) migration management, (3) education, (4) health, (5) municipal infrastructure and (6)
socio-economic support.

The total budget coordinated by the Facility is EUR 3 billion to be contracted in the period 2016-2017.
This is made up of EUR 1 billion from the EU budget, and EUR 2 billion in additional funding from the
Member States. Member States' contributions are made directly to the EU budget in the form of external
assigned revenue pursuant to Article 21(2)(b) FR and assigned to the IPA II and HUMA budget lines
respectively. Of the EUR 1 billion from the EU budget, EUR 250 million was mobilised in 2016 and
EUR 750 million is set aside for the Facility in the 2017 budget.

The Commission concluded individual contribution agreements with all Member States concerning their
national contributions for the combined total of EUR 2 billion pursuant to Article 7 (2) of the Rules of
Application of the FR.

The Facility is implemented as humanitarian and non-humanitarian assistance, with EUR 1.4 billion and
EUR 1.6 billion indicatively allocated to the respective strands. Humanitarian assistance supports the
most vulnerable refugees (and other persons of concern) through predictable and dignified support
addressing basic needs and protection. Non-humanitarian assistance supports the longer-term
livelihoods, socio-economic and educational perspectives of refugees. It aims to help children with access
to primary and secondary education and improvements to educational infrastructure, including school
buildings and learning materials. It also focuses on exposed groups, e.g. by protecting women against
sexual and gender based violence and improving access to sexual and reproductive health care.

The Commission is to keep the EP and the Council regularly informed about the implementation of the
Facility for Refugees in Turkey and has issued the first annual report of the Facility on 2 March 20179.


       3.5.        YOUTH EMPLOYMENT

Almost 4.2 million people under the age of 25 in the EU were unemployed as of August 2016, which
represents an unemployment rate of 18.6 %. While this is an improvement over the peak of 23.7 % in
2013, it still means that almost 1 in every 5 young people is out of work. This number is even higher in
some Member States, for instance Greece (42.7 %), Spain (43.2 %) and Italy (38.8 %) which are
particularly affected.

To combat youth unemployment the EU continued in 2016 to support the roll out of the Youth Guarantee
in the context of the Youth Employment Initiative (YEI) in Member States. The YEI aims to reduce the
levels of youth unemployment in the worst affected regions of the EU. Launched in 2013, the YEI is
providing EUR 6.4 billion of targeted funding for the period 2014-2020 to support actions that help young
people access the labour market in these regions. Of the total EUR 6.4 billion budget of the YEI, half is
provided by a specific EU budget line and the other half comes from the ESF.

The YEI supports young people aged 15-24 (or 15-29 in some EU Member States) who are not in
education, employment or training (NEETs). This can include long-term unemployed young people and
those not registered as job-seekers. In order to be eligible to receive YEI support, these young people
must be living in regions where youth unemployment was higher than 25 % in 2012. Currently there are
regions in 20 Member States benefiting from YEI support.

The funding provided by the YEI is used in the implementation of the Youth Employment Package, and in
particular national Youth Guarantee schemes in the EU Member States that benefit from the YEI. The YEI

is able to reach out directly to young people not in education, employment or training and support them
on a personal level. The “offers” that are funded by the YEI and provided to young people through Youth
Guarantee schemes range from apprenticeships and training courses to subsidies for employers and
start-up support, depending on the specific needs of each young person. In this way the YEI
complements the support from other EU financial resources such as the ESF, which reaches beyond
individuals and helps to bring about educational and employment reforms.

Youth Guarantee schemes are tailored national programmes that aim to ensure all young people under
the age of 25 (or 29 in some Member States) receive a good quality, concrete offer of support within four
months of leaving education or becoming unemployed. To achieve this, the Youth Guarantee schemes
include direct measures targeting young people, as well as comprehensive, longer-term reforms of
employment and education systems, based on wide-ranging partnerships between all relevant
stakeholders.

In October 2016 a progress report showed how the 2013 Youth Guarantee, backed by the YEI, the ESF
and national funding, has made a difference on the ground. Three years on from its launch in 2013 there
are 1.4 million fewer young people unemployed in the EU. Around 9 million young people have taken up
an offer of a job, a traineeship or an apprenticeship. It has led to bold structural reforms in many
Member States and helped build business–education partnerships. To ensure the full and sustainable
implementation of the Youth Guarantee the Commission proposed the continuation of the YEI until 2020
and the extension of its resources. Furthermore, the Commission announced a new dedicated long-
duration (between 6 and 12 months) mobility scheme for apprentices, Erasmus Pro, within the existing
Erasmus+ programme, to support work-based learning abroad.

The Commission launched a New Skills Agenda for Europe in June 2016 with 10 actions to improve the
quality of skills and their relevance for the labour market. These include an initiative to help low-skilled
adults improve their literacy, numeracy and digital skills and/or to help them progress towards an upper
secondary education qualification or equivalent.

During the first three years of the 2014-20 programming period the YEI faced implementation delays
similar to the ones observed for the other ESI Funds under MFF heading 1b. Several reasons led to slower
level of payments than initially foreseen, such as the late adoption of the related ESF operational
programmes and the lengthy preparation for their implementation, including the setting-up of structures
and procedures required under the relevant ESF regulatory framework. To a certain extent, delays
observed in the initial stages of YEI implementation can partly be attributed also to the administrative
capacity constraints of the different responsible structures, especially given the overlap between the two
programming periods. Despite these delays YEI implementation both on the ground and in terms of
payments made by the Commission has so far been faster than the one observed for the ESF, ERDF and
CF.

appropriations




    The above table shows the MFF ceilings at current prices. 2016 was the third financial year covered by
    the MFF 2014-2020. The overall ceiling for commitment appropriations for 2016 was
    EUR 154 738 million, equivalent to 1.05 % of the EU GNI, whilst the corresponding ceiling for payment
    appropriations was EUR 144 685 million, or 0.98 % of the EU GNI valid throughout the budgetary year
    2016.

    The adjustment of cohesion policy envelopes according to Art. 7 of the MFF Regulation was implemented
    by the Technical Adjustment of the MFF for 2017 made by the Commission (COM(2016) 311 of
    30 June 2016), resulting in an upwards adjustment of the MFF ceilings for 2017-2020 for a total amount
    of EUR 4 642 million in commitment appropriations under Heading 1(b) and of EUR 1 367 million in
    payment appropriations (current prices).

    New flexibility provisions have been agreed for the 2014-2020 MFF. One of the new provisions is a
    possibility to transfer unspent margins under the payment ceilings to the following years – via the Global
    Margin for Payments in the framework of the technical adjustment of the MFF for the following year.
    Therefore, the unspent amount from 2015 (EUR 1 288 million in current prices) and 2016
    (EUR 13 991 million in current prices) was transferred to the years 2018-2020 and the ceilings of 2015,
    2016 and 2018-2020 were adjusted accordingly – see the above mentioned technical adjustment of the
    MFF for 2017 and the technical adjustment for 2018 (COM(2017) 220 of 24 May 2017).

    On 14 September 2016 the Commission presented its Communication on the mid-term review/revision of
    the MFF 2014-2020 (COM(2016) 603), which was accompanied by a number of legislative proposals,
    including a proposal to amend the MFF Regulation (COM(2016) 604) and a proposal to simplify financial
    rules under the FR and relevant basic acts (COM(2016) 605). In budgetary terms, the proposals aim at
    increasing the flexibility of the MFF by a number of amendments to the MFF Regulation and by "topping

up" funding for priority spending on jobs and growth and migration and security by using available
margins and flexibilities. An agreement on these proposals is expected in summer of 2017.

Finally, following the entry into force of Council Decision 2014/335 on the system of own resources of the
European Union (OJ L 168, 7.6.2014) and in accordance with its Article 3(3), the ceilings set out in that
Decision were recalculated on the basis of ESA 2010 data which generally increased compared to the GNI
based on ESA 95. Accordingly, the ceiling for own resources was adjusted from 1.23 % to 1.20 % of the
EU GNI; the ceiling for commitment appropriations was adjusted from 1.29 % to 1.26 % of EU GNI
(COM(2016) 829 of 21 December 2016).

An explanation of the various headings of the MFF is given below:

Heading 1 – Smart and inclusive growth

This heading is divided into two separate, but interlinked components

   1a Competitiveness for growth and jobs, encompassing expenditure on research and innovation,
      education and training, Connecting Europe Facility, social policy, the internal market and
      accompanying policies.

   1b Economic, social and territorial cohesion, designed to enhance convergence of the least
      developed Member States and regions, to complement the EU strategy for sustainable
      development outside the less prosperous regions and to support inter regional cooperation.

Heading 2 – Sustainable growth: natural resources

Heading 2 includes the common agricultural and fisheries policies, and the environmental measures, in
particular the Life + program.

Heading 3 – Security and citizenship

Heading 3 (Security and citizenship) reflects the growing importance attached to certain fields where the
EU has been assigned particular tasks – justice and home affairs, border protection, immigration and
asylum policy, public health and consumer protection, culture, youth, information and dialogue with
citizens.

Heading 4 – Global Europe

Heading 4 covers all external action, including development cooperation, humanitarian aid, pre-accession
and neighbourhood instruments. The EDF remains outside of the EU budget and is not part of the MFF.

Heading 5 - Administration

This heading covers administrative expenditure for all institutions, pensions and the European Schools.
For the Institutions other than the Commission, these costs make up the total of their expenditure.

Heading 6 - Compensations

In accordance with the political agreement that new Member States should not become net-contributors
to the budget at the very beginning of their membership, compensation was foreseen under this heading.
This amount was available as transfers to them to balance their budgetary receipts and contributions.

Heading 9 – Special instruments

Flexibility mechanisms enable the EU to mobilise the necessary funds to react to unforeseen events such
as crisis and emergency situations. Their scope, financial allocation and operating modalities are provided
for in the MFF regulation and the Interinstitutional Agreement. In the current context of reduced
expenditure, they also ensure that budgetary resources can respond to evolving priorities, so that every
euro is used where it is most needed. Most of the flexibility mechanisms are therefore kept outside the
MFF and the funding can be mobilised above the expenditure ceilings.

                                 Annual accounts of the European Union 2016


1.2.      ANNUAL BUDGET

Every year, the Commission estimates all the Institutions' revenue and expenditure for the year and
draws up a draft budget which it sends to the budgetary authority. On the basis of this draft budget, the
Council sets out its position, which is then the subject of negotiations between the two arms of the
budgetary authority. The President of the EP declares that the joint draft has been finally adopted, thus
making the budget enforceable. During the year in question, amending budgets are adopted. The task of
executing the budget is mainly the responsibility of the Commission.

The budget structure for the Commission consists of administrative and operational appropriations. The
other Institutions have only administrative appropriations. Furthermore, the budget distinguishes
between two types of appropriations: non-differentiated and differentiated. Non-differentiated
appropriations are used to finance operations of an annual nature (which comply with the principle of
annuality). Differentiated appropriations are used in order to reconcile the principle of annuality with the
need to manage multi-annual operations. Differentiated appropriations are split into commitment and
payment appropriations:

-   commitment appropriations: cover the total cost of the legal obligations entered into for the current
    financial year for operations extending over a number of years. However, budgetary commitments for
    actions extending over more than one financial year may be broken down over several years into
    annual instalments where the basic act so provides.

-   payment appropriations: cover expenditure arising from commitments entered into in the current
    financial year and/or earlier financial years.

In the accounts, the types of funding are grouped into two main items:

–   Final adopted budget appropriations
–   Additional appropriations containing

    •   Carryovers from previous year (the financial regulation allows for a limited number of cases to
        carry unspent amounts from the previous year into the current year); and

    •   Assigned revenue arising from reimbursements, contributions from third parties/countries to EU
        programs and work performed for third parties are assigned directly to the corresponding
        expenditure budget lines and constitute the third pillar of funding

All funding types together form the available appropriations.


1.3.      POLICY AREAS

As part of its use of Activity Based Management (ABM) the Commission implements Activity Based
Budgeting (ABB) in its planning and management processes. ABB involves a budget structure where
budget titles correspond to policy areas and budget chapters to activities. ABB aims to provide a clear
framework for translating the Commission's policy objectives into action, either through legislative,
financial or any other public policy means. By structuring the Commission's work in terms of activities, a
clear picture is obtained of the Commission's undertakings and simultaneously a common framework is
established for priority setting. Resources are allocated to priorities during the budget procedure, using
the activities as the building blocks for budgeting purposes. By establishing such a link between activities
and the resources allocated to them, ABB aims to increase efficiency and effectiveness in the use of
resources in the Commission.

A policy area may be defined as a homogeneous grouping of activities constituting parts of the
Commission's work, which are relevant for the decision-making process. Each policy area corresponds, in
general, to a Directorate General, and encompassing an average of about 6 or 7 individual activities.
Policy areas are mainly operational, since their core activities aim at benefiting a third-party beneficiary
within their respective domains of activity. The operational budget is completed with the necessary
administrative expenditure for each policy area.

                                 Annual accounts of the European Union 2016




1.4.      REVENUE

1.4.1.    Own resources revenue

The vast majority of revenue comes from own resources, which consist of the following categories:

(1) Traditional own resources (TOR): usually account for +/- 14 % of own resource revenue.

(2) Value added tax (VAT) based resource: usually accounts for around 12 % of own resource revenue.

(3) Gross national income (GNI) based resource: usually accounts for +/- 74 % of own resource revenue.

The allocation of own resources is made in accordance with the rules laid down in the Council Decision
No. 2014/335/EU, Euratom of 26 May 2014 on the system of the EU's own resources (ORD 2014). This
decision has entered into force on 1 October 2016 and applies retroactively from 1 January 2014. The
effects for 2014 and 2015 have been taken into account in the 2016 budgetary year.

The total amount of own resources allocated to the Union to cover annual appropriations for
payments shall not exceed 1.20 % of the sum of all the Member States' GNIs.


1.4.2.    Traditional own resources (TOR)

Traditional own resources (TOR) consist of customs duties (levied on imports from third countries) and
sugar levies (paid by sugar producers to finance expenditure on the sugar common organisation of the market)
levied on economic operators and collected by Member States on behalf of the EU. However, Member
States keep 20 % as a compensation for their collection costs. All established traditional own resource
amounts must be entered in one or other of the accounts kept by the competent authorities:

-   In the ordinary accounts provided for in Article 6(3) of Regulation No 609/2014: all amounts
    recovered or guaranteed.
-   In the separate accounts provided for also in the above Article: all amounts not yet recovered and/or
    not guaranteed; amounts guaranteed but challenged may also be entered in this account.

Traditional own resources must be entered in the Commission's account with the Treasury or National
Central Bank by the Member State at the latest on the first working day following the 19th day of the
second month following the month during which the entitlement was established (or recovered in the
case of the separate account).


1.4.3.    Value added tax (VAT)

Value added tax (VAT) is levied on Member States' VAT bases, which are harmonised for this purpose in
accordance with EU rules. However, the VAT base is capped at 50 % of each Member State’s GNI. The
uniform VAT rate applied is fixed at 0.30 % except for the period 2014-2020 in which the rate of call for
Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden was fixed at 0.15 %.


1.4.4.    Gross national income (GNI)

The resource based on gross national income (GNI) is used to finance the part of the budget not covered
by any other sources of revenue. The same percentage rate is levied on each Member States' GNI, which
is established in accordance with EU rules.

VAT and GNI-based resources are determined on the basis of forecasts of relevant bases made when the
draft budget is being prepared. These forecasts are subsequently revised and updated during the budget
year in question by means of an amending budget. Differences between the amounts due by the Member
States by reference to the actual bases and the sums actually paid on the basis of the (revised) forecasts,
either positive or negative, are called by the Commission from the Member States for the first working
day of June of the second year following the budget year in question. Corrections may still be made to the


                                                   119
-----------------------Page 121 End-----------------------

                                 Annual accounts of the European Union 2016

actual VAT and GNI bases during the subsequent four years, unless a reservation is issued. These
reservations have to be seen as potential claims on the Member States for uncertain amounts as their
financial impact cannot be estimated with accuracy. When the exact amount can be determined, the
corresponding VAT and GNI-based resources are called either in connection with VAT and GNI balances or
by individual calls for funds.


1.4.5.    UK correction

A budgetary imbalance correction mechanism in favour of the United Kingdom (reducing their own
resource payments while increasing the payments of other Member States) was instituted by the
European Council in Fontainebleau (June 1984). Germany, Austria, Sweden and Netherlands benefit from
a reduced financing of the UK correction (restricted to one fourth of their normal share).


1.4.6.    Gross reduction

The European Council of 7-8 February 2013 concluded that Denmark, the Netherlands and Sweden
should benefit from gross reductions in their annual contributions based on GNI for the period 2014-2020
and that Austria is to benefit from gross reductions for the period 2014-2016 only. The annual reductions
are as follows: Denmark EUR 130 million, the Netherlands EUR 695 million and Sweden EUR 185 million.
Austria’s gross reduction were set at EUR 30 million in 2014, EUR 20 million in 2015 and EUR 10 million
in 2016 (all amounts in 2011 prices).


1.4.7.    Adjustment relating to the implementation of the ORD 2014 for years 2014 and 2015

Article 11 of the ORD 2014 stipulates that once the Decision enters into force, it shall take effect on
1 January 2014. This means that the financing for the years 2014 and 2015 had to be recalculated
according to the new rules. The adjustment (the difference between the old and the new ORD for years
2014 and 2015) was entered in Amending Budget no 5/2016 and was implemented in a single payment
on the first working day of January 2017.



1.5.      CALCULATION OF THE BUDGET RESULT

The budget result of the EU is returned to the Member States during the following year through deduction
of their amounts due for that year.

The amounts of own resources entered in the accounts are those credited during the course of the year
to the accounts opened in the Commission's name by the governments of the Member States. Revenue
comprises also, in the case of a surplus, the budget result for the previous financial year. The other
revenue entered in the accounts is the amount actually received during the course of the year.

For the purposes of calculating the budget result for the year, expenditure comprises payments made
against the year's appropriations plus any of the appropriations for that year that are carried over to the
following year. Payments made against the year's appropriations means payments that are made by the
accounting officer by 31 December of the financial year. For the EAGF, payments are those effected by
the Member States between 16 October N-1 and 15 October N, provided that the accounting officer was
notified of the commitment and authorisation by 31 January N+1. EAGF expenditure may be subject to a
conformity decision following controls in the Member States.

The budget result comprises two elements: the result of the EU and the result of the participation of the
EFTA countries belonging to the European Economic Area (EEA). In accordance with Article 1(1) of
Regulation No 608/2014 laying down implementing measures for the system of own resources, this result
represents the difference between:

-   total revenue received for the financial year; and

-   total payments made against current year's appropriations plus the total amount of that year's
    appropriations carried over to the following year.




                                                   120
-----------------------Page 122 End-----------------------

                                 Annual accounts of the European Union 2016

The following are added to or deducted from the resulting figure:

-   the net balance of cancellations of payment appropriations carried over from previous years and any
    payments which, because of fluctuations in the euro rate, exceed non-differentiated appropriations
    carried over from the previous year;

-   the evolution of assigned revenue; and

-   the net exchange-rate gains or losses recorded during the year.

Appropriations carried over from the previous financial year in respect of contributions by and work for
third parties, which by definition never lapse, are included as additional appropriations for the financial
year. This explains the difference between carryovers from the previous year in the year N budget
implementation reports and those carried over to the following year in the year N-1 budget
implementation reports. Appropriations made available again following the repayment of payments on
account are disregarded when calculating the budget result.

Payment appropriations carried over include: automatic carryovers and carryovers by decision. The
cancellation of unused payment appropriations carried over from the previous year shows the
cancellations of appropriations carried over automatically and by decision.

          BUDGET RESULT

In accordance with the Financial Regulation, the economic result of the year is calculated on the basis of
accrual accounting principles, while the budget result is based on modified cash accounting rules. As the
economic result and the budget result both cover the same underlying transactions, it is a useful control
to ensure that they are reconcilable.

Reconciling items - Revenue

The actual budgetary revenue for a financial year corresponds to the revenue collected from entitlements
established in the course of the year and amounts collected from entitlements established in previous
years. Therefore the entitlements established in the current year but not yet collected are to be deducted
from the economic result for reconciliation purposes as they do not form part of budgetary revenue. On

                                                   121
-----------------------Page 123 End-----------------------

                                  Annual accounts of the European Union 2016

the contrary the entitlements established in previous years and collected in current year must be added
to the economic result for reconciliation purposes.

The net accrued revenue mainly consists of accrued revenue for agriculture, own resources and interests
and dividends. Only the net-effect, i.e. accrued revenue for current year minus reversal accrued revenue
from previous year, is taken into consideration.

Reconciling items - Expenditure

Net accrued expenses mainly consists of accruals made for year-end cut-off purposes, i.e. eligible
expenses incurred by beneficiaries of EU funds but not yet reported to the Commission. While accrued
expenses are not considered as budgetary expenditure, payments made in the current year relating to
invoices registered in prior years are part of current year's budgetary expenditure.

The net effect of pre-financing is the combination of (1) the new pre-financing amounts paid in the
current year and recognised as budgetary expenditure of the year and (2) the clearing of the pre-
financing paid in current year or previous years through the acceptance of eligible costs. The latter
represent an expense in accrual terms but not in the budgetary accounts since the payment of the initial
pre-financing had already been considered as a budgetary expenditure at the time of its payment.

Besides the payments made against the year's appropriations, the appropriations for that year that are
carried forward to the next year also need to be taken into account in calculating the budget result for
the year (in accordance with Article 1(1) of Regulation No 608/2014). The same applies for the budgetary
payments made in the current year from carry-overs from previous years, and the cancellation of unused
payment appropriations.

The movement in provisions relates to year-end estimates made in the financial statements (employee
benefits mainly) that do not impact the budgetary accounts. Other reconciling amounts comprise different
elements such as asset depreciation, asset acquisitions, capital lease payments and financial
participations for which the budgetary and accrual accounting treatments differ.




2.        IMPLEMENTATION OF THE 2016 EU BUDGET –
          COMMENTARY

2.1.      REVENUE

In the initial adopted EU budget, signed by the President of the European Parliament on
25 November 2015, the amount of payment appropriations was EUR 143 885 million and the amount to
be financed by own resources totalled EUR 142 269 million. The revenue and expenditure estimates in
the initial budget are typically adjusted during the budgetary year, such modifications being presented in
Amending Budgets. Adjustments in the GNI-based own resources ensure that budgeted revenue matches
exactly budgeted expenditure. In accordance with the principle of equilibrium, budget revenue and
expenditure (payment appropriations) must be in balance.

During 2016, six amending budgets were adopted. Taking them into account, the final adopted revenue
for 2016 amounted to EUR 136 642 million. This was financed by own resources totalling
EUR 133 677 million (thus EUR 8 592 million less than initially forecasted) and the remainder by other
revenue. This is explained mainly by the surplus from the previous financial year and the substantial
reduction of payment appropriations that reduced Member States' GNI balancing contribution in 2016.

As far as the own resources result is concerned, the collection of traditional own resources was very close
to the forecasted amounts. This is primarily because the budget estimates were modified at the time the
Amending Budget No. 4/2016 was established (according to the new forecasts of spring 2016).

The final Member States' VAT and GNI payments also correspond closely to the final budgetary estimate.
The differences between the forecasted amounts and the amounts actually paid are due to the differences
between the euro rates used for budgetary purposes and the rates in force at the time when the Member
States outside the EMU actually made their payments.

                                 Annual accounts of the European Union 2016

As far as the VAT and GNI balances are concerned there is a new procedure in place. The rules are set
out in Article 10 b of the Making available regulation (Regulation 609/2014). The new procedure does not
entail an Amending Budget and therefore the Commission will directly request the Member States to pay
the net amounts. The impact for the EU budget will be close to zero. Commission will communicate the
annual adjustments to Member States and the amounts will be made available in June 2017. Also due to
the change for 2016 there have been no balances.

The heading "Contributions and refunds in connection with EU agreements and programmes" concerns
mainly revenue from the EAGF and EAFRD (and in particular the clearance of accounts and irregularities),
the participation of third countries in research programs and other contributions and refunds to EU
programs/activities. A substantial part of this total is made up of earmarked revenue, which typically
gives rise to the entering of additional appropriations on the expenditure side.

The revenue from fines relates mainly to fines in the field of competition.


2.2.      EXPENDITURE

2016 was the third year of the current programming period 2014-2020. The 2016 budget set the
priorities of delivering on growth and jobs like its predecessor. However, it also stressed the importance
of the new migration challenges regarding the crisis in Syria and North Africa.

As regards commitments, the 2016 budget totalling EUR 155.3 billion was 4.3 % lower than the 2015
budget with a significant decrease in Heading 1b (down by 15.8 % mainly due to the one-off effect of the
re-programming from 2014 to 2015), partially counterbalanced by a big increase in Heading 3 (up by
70.2 %).

In 2016, amending budget 4 further increased commitment appropriations for programmes tackling
migration and security issues under Heading 3 - Security and Citizenship for the amount of
EUR 250 million in commitment appropriations. From this increase, EUR 130 million were allocated to the
AMIF and EUR 70 million to the ISF. Under Heading 1a, additional commitment appropriations of
EUR 74 million was allocated to EFSI, to cover its extension until 2020.

Heading 4 Global Europe was reinforced in commitments through amending budgets by EUR 210 million
mainly for the European Neighbourhood Instrument and Humanitarian Aid programmes. Funding was
partly granted through the reduction of the Common Foreign and Security Policy and Macro-financial
Assistance programmes.

Payment appropriations of the final adopted budget amounted to EUR 136.6 billion, 3.3 % below the
2015 level. This has been mainly the result of a decrease by EUR 7.3 billion through amending budget 4,
mostly related to Heading 1b - Economic, social and territorial cohesion and to a lesser extent to Heading
2 - Sustainable Growth. Further details on the underlying reasons for this decrease are provided in the
section below.

2016 Implementation of available appropriations

The year 2016 was closed with a 97 % implementation of commitments and a leftover in payment
appropriations of EUR 4.8 billion. Implementation of commitments amounted to EUR 157.3 billion. For
payments, the implementation reached EUR 132.4 billion or 92 % of available appropriations.

Following several years of constrained payment appropriations and accumulation of unpaid claims (mostly
in cohesion), the abnormal backlog was fully phased out in 2016, in line with the 'payment plan' agreed
with the EP and the Council in 2015. The Commission identified the risk of under-implementation of
payment appropriations for cohesion already in March 2016 and increased its surplus estimates
considerably in September, following Member States' updated forecasts from July. In addition, the
Commission took into account the delays in designating national authorities, the implementation pace on
the ground and the average forecast implementation rate for previous programming periods. It then
proposed amending budget 4/2016 to decrease the level of payment appropriations by EUR 7.3 billion,
mostly in budget lines under sub-heading 1b Economic, social and territorial cohesion. The level of
payable claims actually submitted by the end of the year by Member States for 2014-2020 programmes
proved to be an unprecedented EUR 8 billion lower than the forecast, with 26 Member States submitting
claims below their forecast.

Outstanding Commitments

The outstanding commitments (RAL) by the end of the year increased significantly to reach
EUR 238.8 billion. The increase of over EUR 21 billion compared to 2015 was twice as high from what was
initially expected due to the widened gap between implemented commitments and payments (stemming
from amending budget 4/2016 as well as the end-of-year under-implementation). In 2017 a further
increase of RAL is expected given the difference between budgeted commitment and payment
appropriations (ratio 85 %).

The outstanding legal commitments of the previous programming periods, i.e. before 2014, decreased in
2016 from EUR 75 billion to EUR 40 billion (-47 %). Consequently, a bigger share of payment
appropriations will be available for the current programmes starting from 2017.

A more detailed analysis of budgetary adjustments, their relevant context, justification and impact is
presented in the Commission's report on Budgetary and Financial Management 2016, Part A "Overview at
budget level" and Part B dealing with each heading of the multiannual financial framework (MFF).

Budget surplus

The budget surplus amounts to EUR 6.4 billion and arises primarily from the expenditure side, due to the
under-implementation mainly in heading 1b (EUR 4.9 billion). The origin of surplus on the revenue side is
mainly due to important revenues on fines and slightly lower own resources (+EUR 1.7 billion). An
exchange rate loss of EUR 173 million lowers the final result.

The consolidated reports on the implementation of the general budget of the EU include, as in previous years, the budget implementation of all Institutions
since within the EU budget a separate budget for each Institution is established. Agencies do not have a separate budget inside the EU budget and they are
partially financed by a Commission budget subsidy.

Concerning the EEAS, it should be noted that, in addition to its own budget, it also receives contributions from the Commission of EUR 140 million (2015:
EUR 138 million) and the EDF of EUR 44 million (2015: EUR 61 million). These budget credits are put at the disposal of the EEAS (as assigned revenue) so
as to cover primarily the costs of Commission staff working in the EU delegations, these delegations being administratively managed by the EEAS.

GLOSSARY

Actuarial assumptions
Assumptions used to calculate the costs of future events that affect the pension liability.

Actuarial gains and losses
For a defined benefit scheme, the changes in actuarial deficits or surpluses. They arise as a result of
differences between the previous actuarial assumptions and what has actually occurred and due to effects of
changes in actuarial assumptions.

Administrative appropriations
Administrative appropriations cover the running costs of the Institutions and entities (staff, buildings, office
equipment).

Adopted budget
Draft budget becomes the adopted budget as soon as it is approved by the Budgetary Authority.

Amending budget
Decision adopted during the budget year to amend (increase, decrease, transfer) aspects of the adopted
budget of that year.

Amounts to be called from Member States
These represent expenses incurred during the reporting period that will need to be funded by future budgets,
i.e. by the EU Member States. This is a consequence of the co-existence of accruals based financial
statements and a cash based budget.

Annual Activity Report (AAR)
Annual Activity Reports indicate the results of operations by reference to objectives set, associated risks and
the form of internal control, inter alia. Since the 2001 budget exercise for the Commission and since 2003 for
all European Union (EU) institutions, the ‘authorising officer by delegation’ must submit an AAR to his/her
institution on the performance of his/her duties, together with financial and management information.

Appropriations
Budget funding. The budget forecasts both commitments and payments (cash or bank transfers to the
beneficiaries). Appropriations for commitments and payments often differ (differentiated appropriations)
because multi annual programmes and projects are usually fully committed in the year they are decided and
are paid over the years as the implementation of the programme and project progresses. Non-differentiated
appropriations apply to administrative expenditure, for agricultural market support and direct payments and
commitment appropriations equal payment appropriations.

Assigned revenue
Dedicated revenue received to finance specific items of expenditure. The main source of external assigned
revenue is financial contributions from third countries to programmes financed by the Union. The main
source of internal assigned revenue is revenue from third parties in respect of goods, services or work
supplied at their request; revenue arising from the repayment of amounts wrongly paid and revenue from
the sale of publications and films, including those on an electronic medium.

Available for sale financial assets
All financial assets (except derivatives) that are according to International Public Sector Accounting
Standards measured at fair value and for which the changes in fair value are to be recognised in a reserve in
net assets until derecognition (or impairment).

Budget line
As far as the budget structure is concerned, revenue and expenditure are shown in the budget in accordance
with a binding nomenclature which reflects the nature and purpose of each item, as imposed by the
budgetary authority. The individual headings (title, chapter, article or line) provide a formal description of the
nomenclature.

Cancellation of appropriations
Unused appropriations that may no longer be used.

Carryover of appropriations
Exception to the principle of annuality in so far as appropriations that could not be used in a given budget
year may, under strict conditions, be exceptionally carried over for use during the following year.

Commitment
Legal pledge to provide finance subject to certain conditions. The EU commits itself to reimbursing its share
of the costs of an EU-funded project. Today’s commitments are tomorrow’s payments. Today’s payments are
yesterday’s commitments.

Commitment appropriation
Commitment appropriations cover the total cost of legal obligations (contracts, grant agreements/decisions)
that could be signed in the current financial year.

Current service cost
The increase in scheme liabilities arising from service in the current financial year.

Decommitment
An act whereby a previous commitment (or part of it) is cancelled.

Defined benefit scheme
A pension or other retirement benefit scheme where the scheme rules define the benefits independently of
the contributions payable, and the benefits are not directly related to the investments of the scheme. The
scheme may be funded or unfunded.

Derivatives
Financial instruments whose value is linked to changes in the value of another financial instrument, an
indicator or a commodity. In contrast to the holder of a primary financial instrument (e.g. a government
bond), who has an unqualified right to receive cash (or some other economic benefit) in the future, the
holder of a derivative has only a qualified right to receive such a benefit. An example of a derivative is
currency forward contract.

Direct management
Mode of budget implementation. Under direct management the budget is implemented directly by
Commission services, Executive Agencies or Trust Funds.

Discount rate
The rate used to adjust for the time value of money. Discounting is a technique used to compare costs and
benefits that occur in different time periods.

Effective interest rate
The rate that discounts estimated future cash receipts or payments over the expected life of the financial
asset or financial liability to the net carrying amount of the asset or liability.

Financial assets or liabilities at fair value through surplus or deficit
All financial assets or liabilities that are according to International Public Sector Accounting Standards
measured at fair value and for which the changes in fair value are to be recognised in surplus or deficit of the
period (i.e. derivatives).

Financial correction
The purpose of financial corrections is to protect the EU budget from the burden of erroneous or irregular
expenditure. For expenditure under shared management, the task of recovering incorrectly made payments
is primarily the responsibility of the Member State.
A 'confirmed' financial correction has been accepted by the Member State concerned. A 'decided' financial
correction has been adopted by a Commission decision and is always a net correction, where the Member
State is required to reimburse irregular funds to the EU budget, thus leading to a definitive reduction of the
allocated envelope to the Member State concerned. Confirmed and decided financial corrections are reported
in this publication as one category.
An 'implemented' financial correction has corrected the observed irregularity.

Indirect management
Mode of budget implementation. Under indirect management the Commission confers tasks of budget
implementation to bodies of EU law or national law.

Interruptions and suspensions
If the Commission finds, based on its own work or the information reported by audit authorities, that a
Member State has failed to remedy serious shortcomings in the management and control systems and/or to
correct irregular expenditure which had been declared and certified, it may interrupt or suspend payments.

Irregularity
An irregularity is an act which does not comply with EU rules and which has a potentially negative impact on
EU financial interests, but which may be the result of genuine errors committed either by beneficiaries
claiming funds or by the authorities responsible for making payments. If an irregularity is committed
deliberately, it constitutes fraud.

Lapsing appropriations
Unused appropriations to be cancelled at the end of the financial year. Lapsing means the cancellation of all
or part of the authorisation to make expenditures and/or incur liabilities which is represented by an
appropriation.

Own resources
Represent the main funding for the EU institutions and bodies and are defined in the own resources
regulation 609/2014. Own resources comprise GNI-based resources, VAT-based resources and traditional
own resources.

Payment appropriations
Payment appropriations cover expenditure due in the current year, arising from legal commitments entered
in the current year and/or earlier years.

Pre-financing
A payment intended to provide the beneficiary with a float. It may be split into a number of payments in
accordance with the provisions of the underlying contract, decision, agreement or the basic legal act. The
float or advance is either used for the purpose for which it was provided during the period defined in the
agreement or it is repaid.

Preventive measure
Preventive measures, which are at the Commission’s disposal to protect the EU budget when it is aware of
potential deficiencies, include suspensions and interruptions of payments from the EU budget to the
operational programme.

Reste à Liquider (RAL)
Represents the amount where a budgetary commitment has been made but the subsequent payment is not
yet done. They represent payment obligations for the EU for future years and stem directly from the
existence of multi annual programmes and the dissociation between commitment and payment
appropriations.

Shared management

Mode of budget implementation. Under shared management budget implementation tasks are delegated to
Member States. About 80 % of the EU expenditure falls under this implementation mode.

Traditional own resources
These represent revenue for the EU and are part of the 'own resources' which fund the activities of the EU.
Traditional own resources are defined in the own resource regulation 609/2014 and comprise customs duties
and sugar levies.

Transfers (between budget lines)
Transfers between budget lines imply the relocation of appropriations from one budget line to another, in the
course of the financial year, and thereby they constitute an exception to the budgetary principle of
specification. They are, however, expressly authorised by the Treaty on the Functioning of the European
Union under the conditions laid down in the Financial Regulation (FR). The FR identifies different types of
transfers depending on whether they are between or within budget titles, chapters, articles or headings and
require different levels of authorisation.
