We continued our important work as a provider of
knowledge services in 2018. Our DMCs benefited
from products such as the Asian Development
Outlook’s special theme chapter “How Technology
Affects Jobs” and the hosting of events such as the
Asia Clean Energy Forum, Transport Forum, and
Global Infrastructure Forum. By attracting experts
from across the region and around the world, these
events garner breakthrough ideas and innovations
that can later be embedded into our projects and
programs.
On the funding side, we raised more than
$23 billion in 17 different currencies to ensure a
robust resource base for ADB.
Internally, we continued efforts to modernize our
human resources practices. We recruited a record
370 new staff in 2018. This includes 22 young
professionals, our largest intake ever. Performance

meet our target of 40% by the end of 2022.

     BYPASS A BOOST
     FOR BANGLADESH

      In December 2018, a consortium of companies
     from the People’s Republic of China—Sichuan Road
     and Bridge Group, Shamim Enterprise, and UDC
     Construction—signed a concession contract with the
     Government of Bangladesh to upgrade the Dhaka
     Bypass under a public–private partnership (PPP)
     arrangement.

     ADB acted as financial advisor on the transaction to the
     PPP Authority of Bangladesh, focusing on commercial
     aspects such as currency indexation, minimum revenue
     guarantees, review of the financial model, and support
     during the bid process and negotiations.

     The project is the first road PPP to be implemented
     under Bangladesh’s PPP Act. It will add 48 kilometers
     of four-lane tollway and two-lane service road to
     the N105 Highway, providing vital connections with
     industrial zones, ports, and highways to other major
12   cities.

     “This project brings a new dimension to public service
     delivery in Bangladesh. It is the first access-controlled
     expressway in the country,” says chief executive officer
     of the PPP Authority, Syed Afsor H. Uddin. “This
     landmark transaction will pave the way for a pipeline of
     national expressways across Bangladesh.”                         Traffic slows to a stop on a busy freeway in Dhaka, Bangladesh. ADB acted

    TOWARD A RESILIENT KOLKATA


     Flooding is a hard fact of life in Kolkata, India. The
    sprawling coastal city of more than 14 million people is
    considered one of the world’s most flood-prone. Heavy
    monsoon rains and frequent storms cause water to
    regularly flood into a city with flat terrain, poor drainage,
    and a population largely unprepared. These events, which
    have become more frequent due to climate change, cause
    major damage to both lives and livelihoods.

    In September, the city’s residents received some good
    news when Kolkata’s mayor launched India’s first
    city-level flood forecasting and early warning system.
    Supported by ADB technical assistance, the system will
    provide forecasts as well as real-time information on
    inundation, temperature, air quality, and other climate-
    related data through 400 sensor nodes placed around the
    city. The data will be analyzed and shared with the city’s
    residents immediately through mobile alerts and public
    service announcements on radio and TV. The system will
    improve flood awareness and safety at the community
    level, as well as reduce economic impacts.                                                                                                                   17

     In Central and West Asia, ADB is helping farmers, crop
    producers, and agribusinesses embrace modern technologies
    to participate more effectively in horticulture value chains. In
    2018, the bank approved a $75 million grant to Afghanistan
    and additional financing of $198 million for Uzbekistan to
    expand access to finance for farmers and enterprises.

    In Afghanistan, where agriculture employs two-thirds of the
    workforce and contributes 22% of gross domestic product,
    enterprises are benefiting from the latest in precooling
    rooms, storage facilities, processing equipment and
    machinery, a quality control accredited laboratory, a tissue
    culture laboratory, and an introduction to international best
    practices for horticulture processing plants. Eligible farmers
    are accessing assistance for modern greenhouses; planting
    materials; storage facilities; processing, drying, and grading
    equipment; and water sourcing and distribution systems.

    In Uzbekistan, the additional financing is increasing farm
    productivity by improving processing and storage capacities
    and reducing post-harvest losses through the establishment
    and upgrade of intensive orchards; modern water- and
    energy-efficient greenhouses; and processing, storage, and
    refrigeration facilities. This ADB assistance will help improve
    Uzbekistan’s agriculture sector, which accounts for 32% of the
    country’s total employment and provides a significant portion
    of income in rural areas.

                                      Responding to External Shocks in CAREC Countries

                                  Many CAREC countries are vulnerable to external economic shocks
                                  because of their reliance on natural resource exports or remittances from
                                  oil-exporting countries. Determining the right policy mix for temporary
                                  and permanent shocks remains a challenge. In May, ADB, the International
                                  Monetary Fund, and the World Bank held a forum in Astana, Kazakhstan,
                                  to discuss lessons learned from the implementation of countercyclical
                                  policies in response to external shocks.

     In East Asia, ADB is demonstrating innovative approaches
    to reducing carbon emissions and mitigating the effects of
    climate change. In the People’s Republic of China (PRC),
    the bank financed projects that include district heating and
    cooling based on renewable energy in Qingdao City, wind-
    powered district heating in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous
    Region, an emissions trading scheme in Shanghai, and bus
    rapid transit in Yichang and Jinan cities. In Mongolia, ADB
    is leveraging private sector investment to help transform ger
    areas of Ulaanbaatar into affordable, low-carbon ecodistricts.

    The bank is promoting climate-smart agriculture practices,
    integrated water resources management, and enhanced
    coordination for watershed and river basin management and
    protection across East Asia. It has partnered with the China
    Council for International Cooperation on Environment and
    Development—a high-level advisory body to the Government
    of the PRC—to undertake a policy study on ecological
    compensation and green development institutional reform.

    Through technical assistance, ADB is helping the PRC develop
    a project that utilizes internet technology—mobile internet,
    the internet of things, cloud computing, and big data—
    to access high-value agricultural markets. The bank is also
    strengthening information and communication technology
    to help the Government of Mongolia improve its tax
    administration and public investment management.

     ADB has made a series of major investments in
    communications technology to connect Pacific island nations
    to the internet via fiber-optic submarine cables.

    In 2013, 827 kilometers of cable (cofinanced by ADB,
    the Government of Tonga, Tonga Cable, and the World
    Bank Group) connected Tonga to the main trans-Pacific
    link between Australia and the United States. Since then,
    connection speeds have doubled and internet costs have
    fallen 75% (compared with satellites), delivering digital health
    and digital education services, stabilizing business expenses,
    and greatly improving the social life of Tongans.

    Palau was connected to a cable between Indonesia and
    Guam in 2017, while the 1,300-kilometer Tui-Samoa cable
    (cofinanced by ADB, the governments of Australia and
    Samoa, Samoa Submarine Cable Company, and the World
    Bank) was switched on in February 2018 and links the
    country’s largest islands, Upolu and Savai’i, to the cable
    network in Fiji.

    These projects, together with two others currently in
    implementation, are projected to benefit nearly 450,000
    people in the Cook Islands, the Federated States of
    Micronesia, Kiribati, Nauru, Palau, Samoa, and Tonga.

      In developing infrastructure across South Asia, ADB is
     promoting advanced technologies that increase durability,
     improve the efficiency and quality of services, and minimize
     environmental and social impacts.

     In India, ADB is financing new technology to improve water
     management. Through efficient use of surface water and a
     shift to piped-water schemes (away from high-risk public
     standposts or tapstands), the bank is working to provide
     safe drinking water in West Bengal, where water sources are
     threatened by high levels of arsenic, fluoride, and salinity.
     Networked smart water grids—which automate monitoring
     and control devices—address water leaks, overuse, and
     quality issues to ensure consistent and sustainable delivery
     of potable water to about 1.7 million people in 390,000
     households.

     In Nepal, ADB is applying innovative technology to the
     country’s outdated electricity distribution system. Nepal
     makes use of analog meters, which may produce inaccurate
     readings and require meter readers to make frequent visits to
     remote locations. ADB is supporting the country’s switch to
     smart meters, which are more accurate, reliable, and capable
     of remote customer metering—enhancing the efficiency of
     Nepal’s electricity network.

    In August 2018, an earthquake hit the Indonesian island of
   Lombok. In September, an earthquake and tsunami struck the
   city of Palu in Sulawesi. The disasters killed over 2,600 people,
   injured 18,000, and displaced more than 550,000. A One ADB
   approach was critical to providing rapid and effective support
   to Indonesia.

   ADB specialists in energy, water and sanitation, transportation,
   and public finance worked together to conduct damage
   assessments and provide technical advice to counterparts from
   the Government of Indonesia. A team of social development
   experts helped ensure that ADB’s support addressed the
   needs of women and girls, and incorporated best practices in
   disaster preparedness and resilience. Financial management
   specialists helped the government explore effective channels
   for monitoring, evaluation, and financial reporting.

   In November, ADB approved $500 million in emergency
   assistance to support recovery and rehabilitation efforts—
   less than 5 weeks after the government requested assistance.

   Across Lombok and Sulawesi, around 36,000 households are
   expected to benefit from climate-resilient housing and access
   to improved water and sanitation services; about 5,000 farmers
   will have better access to water for irrigation; and over 650,000
   displaced people will benefit from livelihood assistance and
   social protection measures.

    THE ONE ADB APPROACH IN
    PRIVATE SECTOR OPERATIONS

     In November 2018, ADB signed an $80 million loan
    agreement with Samruk-Energy, the largest power generation
    company in Kazakhstan. A state-owned enterprise wholly owned
    by the sovereign wealth fund Samruk-Kazyna, Samruk-Energy
    commands 31% of Kazakhstan’s installed generation capacity.

    As part of the Government of Kazakhstan’s privatization plan, the
    company aims to prepare for an initial public offering by 2020.

    ADB is providing Samruk-Energy with long-tenor tenge
    financing that is not sufficiently available in the local market.
    The financing supports the company’s business restructuring
    and transformation plan aimed at reducing foreign exchange
    risks, improving operational efficiency, and identifying renewable
    energy opportunities to attract investors for the initial public
    offering.

    The financing arrangement was ADB’s first nonsovereign
    transaction with a state-owned enterprise in Kazakhstan, and

    FANNING THE WINDS OF CHANGE
    IN PAKISTAN

     In 2009, ADB provided a long-term, US dollar-
    denominated loan to Zorlu Enerji Elektrik Uretim to finance
    the construction of a $147 million 56.4-megawatt (MW)
    wind farm—Pakistan’s first wind power project.

    ADB’s commitment and structuring of financing provided the
    impetus for investment in Pakistan’s renewable energy sector,
    with six wind projects totaling 310 MW developed from 2009
    to 2014.

    The original project produces 155 gigawatt-hours of
    competitively priced electricity every year and contributes to
    annual greenhouse gas emission savings of 102,525 tons of
    carbon dioxide.

    The project’s success resulted in a follow-up project with
    Zorlu Enerji for the design, construction, operation, and
    maintenance of a 100-MW solar power plant and associated
    infrastructure.

    Such projects are helping to improve access to clean power                                                                                   45
