    For All Who Serve
    NATO’s ability to preserve peace and security relies, above all, on the skill and
    determination of the men and women of Allied and partner countries’ armed forces.

    In 2017, tens of thousands of Allied and partner personnel were deployed on NATO
    missions and operations – on land, at sea and in the air. Their willingness to serve
    – and the professionalism they display each day – is the single most important
    contribution to the safety of the citizens the Alliance exists to protect.

    NATO recognises the debt of gratitude it owes them for the risks they take, and the
    sacrifices they and their families make. They are the embodiment of the Alliance’s
    values and of our commitment to coming to each other’s aid.

                     NATO’s chief responsibility is to protect its citizens and nations, a task it has
                successfully carried out for nearly 70 years. To prevent conflict and preserve peace,
                      the Alliance must deter and defend against any security threat, no matter
                  its complexity or origin. In the last twelve months, NATO has continued to adapt
                                                in order to do exactly that.

Relations with Russia
NATO’s policy towards Russia remains consistent: defence and dialogue.

After the Cold War, NATO and Russia were striving towards a strategic partnership. However,
after Russia’s illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014, all practical cooperation was suspended.

At the same time, however, NATO maintains political dialogue and military-to-military lines of
communications with Russia. Efforts to reduce risk and increase transparency are also ongoing.

At the Warsaw Summit, NATO leaders reaffirmed that the nature of the Alliance's relations with
Russia will be contingent on a clear, constructive change in Russia's actions – one that demonstrates
compliance with international law and its international obligations and responsibilities.
The Alliance maintains a firm position, based on a dual-track approach of strong deterrence
and defence complemented by a periodic, focused and meaningful dialogue. That dialogue
is carried out on the basis of reciprocity in the NATO-Russia Council. This is important to avoid
misunderstanding, miscalculation and unintended escalation, as well as to increase transparency
and predictability.

In 2017, the NATO-Russia Council met three times – in March, July and October. At each
meeting, the Council discussed the conflict in and around Ukraine, including the need for the full
implementation of the Minsk Agreements, issues relating to military activities, transparency and
risk reduction, as well as the security situation in Afghanistan and the regional terrorist threat.

NATO continued to maintain a dialogue with Russia on air safety in the Baltic Sea region. In light
of the increased air activity in the Baltic Sea region in recent years, it has become increasingly
important to boost predictability and transparency in order to prevent incidents and accidents,
and avoid unintended escalation. In 2016, the International Civil Aviation Organization’s Baltic
Sea Project Team briefed the NATO-Russia Council on this important topic. Subsequently,
a Finnish-led Expert Group on Baltic Sea Air Safety was established to build on the work of
the Baltic Sea Project Team. The group – with the participation of Allied and partner countries
from the region, Russia and NATO, inter alia – developed recommendations and guidance on
the handling and resolution of air encounters between all aircraft, both civilian and military, in
peacetime. Supported by the Allies, these recommendations were published by the International
Civil Aviation Organization in December 2017.

In 2017, the NATO-Russia Council began to exchange advanced reciprocal briefings on upcoming
exercises. This mutual exchange has the potential to contribute towards greater predictability
and risk reduction in the Euro-Atlantic area. However, these voluntary briefings cannot replace
mandatory transparency under the Vienna Document.

The Secretary General met with the Russian Foreign Minister in February, May and September.
The Deputy Secretary General maintained regular contact with the Russian Ambassador to
NATO throughout the year, as well as with other Russian officials. NATO’s military leaders have
also continued to communicate directly with their Russian counterparts.

  Nuclear Deterrence

  Nuclear deterrence has made a major contribution to peace and stability in Europe and beyond for more than
  70 years, and has been at the heart of NATO’s posture. At the Warsaw Summit in 2016, Allies recognised
  the importance of nuclear deterrence as a key element of the Allied deterrence posture, for the specific
  purpose of preserving peace, preventing coercion, and deterring aggression. As long as nuclear weapons
  exist, NATO will remain a nuclear alliance.

  At the same time, the Alliance is committed to seeking the conditions necessary for a world without nuclear
  weapons, in accordance with the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and in a step-by-step and verifiable manner.

  NATO is also concerned about the threat of nuclear proliferation and it has taken a firm stand in condemning
  the Democratic People's Republic of Korea for carrying out nuclear and missile tests. North Korea’s
  destabilising behaviour poses a threat to international peace and security and the Alliance has called on
  North Korea to abandon nuclear weapons and nuclear and ballistic missile programmes in a complete,
  verifiable, and irreversible manner. NATO also urges the country to comply with its international obligations
  and recommit to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.

  Allied commitment to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty remains unwavering. The Treaty is the cornerstone
  of the global nuclear non-proliferation and safeguards regime and the basis for global disarmament efforts.

  The Alliance also recognises the importance of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty to Euro-
  Atlantic security. The Treaty has contributed to strategic stability and reduced the risk of miscalculation
  leading to conflict. The Alliance is committed to the preservation of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces
  Treaty and strongly believes full compliance with this landmark arms control treaty is needed. In December
  2017, NATO recognised the United States’ compliance with its obligations under the Intermediate-Range
  Nuclear Forces Treaty and its commitment to implementing the Treaty. The Alliance also welcomed the
  continued efforts by the United States to engage Russia to resolve concerns about Russia’s compliance
  with the Treaty.

Over the years, NATO has also trained thousands of
munitions experts. In 2017 alone, NATO conducted
approximately 20 training courses on small arms,
arms control, CBRN defence and non-proliferation
at the NATO School in Oberammergau, Germany.
NATO experts also contributed to numerous other
courses at NATO Centres of Excellence and affiliated
training centres in Allied and partner countries.

In 2017, NATO led a number of projects focused
on small arms and light weapons. These included
conducting small arms and ammunition safety
training in southeastern Europe and North Africa, and
developing guidelines to incorporate United Nations
Security Council Resolution 1325 on Women,
Peace and Security into small arms, light weapons
and mine action efforts as well as into arms control.
Information on all related NATO projects is publicly

Through all these activities, the Alliance contributes
to a more stable security environment, enhances
cooperation with its partner countries, and
strengthens national, regional and global security.

MODERNISING
      NATO

           One of NATO’s greatest strengths is its ability to adapt to the changing security
           environment – something it has done again and again since its creation in 1949.
          In 2017, the Alliance continued to modernise and innovate to meet the challenges
                               of a more complex security environment.

The Next Generation Rotorcraft
Helicopters play a vital role in NATO operations and missions. Over the next 10-15 years, however, the helicopter
fleets of many Allies will reach the end of their service lives. NATO has therefore launched the Next Generation
Rotorcraft Capabilities initiative to replace the current fleets.

The NATO Army Armaments Group is already establishing the requirements for the Next Generation
Rotorcraft, working with industry to ensure that it is able to deliver the requested specifications. The future
platforms will incorporate cutting-edge technologies to fly in so-called ‘degraded visual environments’ and
control unmanned systems through Manned-Unmanned Teaming.

Poor visibility may be caused by dust, snow, rain, smoke or bad light. It is directly or indirectly responsible for
more than half of all helicopter incidents. The new technologies will greatly reduce these risks, allowing Allies’
helicopters to operate in otherwise inaccessible conditions.

In this context, the ‘Degraded Visual Environment’ project led by Germany, Switzerland and the United
States aims to develop tools for helicopter pilots to navigate safely in difficult conditions. The project focuses
on new arrays of sensors, human-machine interface and autonomy. Flight trials were held in Yuma, the United
States in 2016 to test dust-obscured environments or ‘brown-out’, and in Manching, Germany and Alpnach,
Switzerland in 2017 to test snow-obscured environments or ‘white-out’. The tested prototypes successfully met
the requirements and proved that this capability could be introduced within three to five years.

Alliance Future Surveillance and Control
At the Warsaw Summit in July 2016, NATO launched the Alliance Future Surveillance and Control initiative
to ensure that the Alliance can maintain its information advantage and exercise command over its forces after
AWACS retires around 2035. This initiative will fundamentally redefine how NATO conducts surveillance and
commands its forces in the future.
In 2017, the Alliance Future Surveillance and Control initiative entered a new phase. Following an agreement
by Defence Ministers in February 2017, NATO launched the concept stage – whereby all 29 Allies cooperate in
planning for the future after AWACS retires from service. In 2017, the Alliance Future Surveillance and Control
Solutions Working Group, led by the NATO Science and Technology Organization, worked on developing such
plans by integrating input from science and technology experts, NATO military authorities and industry.
This initiative shows how, by looking far into the future and by working together in developing high-end
capabilities, the Alliance can be far more than the sum of its parts.

Crisis Management Exercise 2017
NATO’s major annual Crisis Management
Exercise helps to ensure that the Alliance is ready
to respond to the security threats it faces. In 2017,
the Crisis Management Exercise, CMX17, tested the
Organization's ability to respond quickly to a fictitious
but realistic crisis scenario on collective defence that
included challenges posed by hybrid warfare tactics.
It tested the effectiveness and flexibility of NATO’s
internal processes as well as its consultation and
decision-making procedures. The exercise involved
staffs in national capitals, NATO Headquarters
(including delegations and military missions, the
North Atlantic Council and subordinate committees)
and NATO’s Strategic Commands. Partner countries
Finland and Sweden also participated in the exercise
alongside Allies. As in previous years, no forces were
deployed during the Crisis Management Exercise.

In addition, for the first time, CMX17 implemented
the concept of parallel and coordinated exercises
between NATO and the European Union, as agreed
in the Joint Declaration on NATO-EU cooperation
issued in Warsaw in 2016. Through the conduct
of two parallel but separate exercises, NATO and
EU staff tested their respective procedures for
communicating and sharing information during an
unfolding fictitious crisis scenario set in a hybrid
environment.

under the provisions of United Nations Security
Council Resolution 1244.

Today, the NATO-led Kosovo Force, or KFOR,
continues to support wider international efforts to
maintain peace and stability in Kosovo and in the
broader region. KFOR’s mission is to maintain
a safe and secure environment and freedom of
movement for all communities in Kosovo. In 2017,
KFOR force levels remained largely unchanged,
with 4,500 troops provided by NATO Allies and
partner countries. Due to improved circumstances,
at no point in 2017 was KFOR asked to intervene
to provide security – including during general and
municipal elections.

KFOR’s work supports the development of
professional, democratic and multi-ethnic security
structures in Kosovo. In 2017, NATO continued to
provide capacity-building support to the Kosovo
Security Force and related civilian structures through
the NATO Advisory and Liaison Team. Located
in Pristina, it comprises approximately 40 civilian
and military personnel and provides advice and
assistance in areas such as logistics, procurement
and finance, force development and planning, and
leadership development.

 Science for Peace and Security Programme: 2017 Highlights

 In the context of NATO’s efforts to counter terrorism, the Science for Peace and Security Programme
 developed a new flagship initiative focused on the detection of explosives. The initiative invests in improving
 stand-off detection technologies, developing data fusion algorithms and technologies, and providing
 response actions in the event of an alarm in real-time and in mass-transit environments.

 Science for Peace and Security activities also supported the Defence and Related Security Capacity
 Building Initiative. Assistance to Iraq included delivering expert training and specialist equipment to
 counter improvised explosive devices (IED). In Jordan, Science for Peace and Security activities focused
 on cyber defence, counter-IED and border security. Meanwhile, in the Republic of Moldova, the Programme
 supported both cyber defence and the development of a National Action Plan for the implementation of
 United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325 on Women, Peace and Security.

 In 2017, the Science for Peace and Security Programme stepped up its already strong cooperation with
 NATO’s partners in the Middle East and North Africa. Some key initiatives included:
 -- Providing equipment and conducting counter-improvised explosive device training courses for Egyptian
    experts at the Counter IED Centre of Excellence in Spain
 -- Advancing a project to set up a national crisis management coordination centre in Mauritania, serving as
    a model for the wider Sahel region. In this framework, in 2017, civil emergency protection experts from
    Mauritania received three final training sessions in France
 -- Conducting the first activity with Algeria in the field of terahertz technology with the aim of contributing to
    the fight against terrorism
 -- Continuing cooperation with Israel, an active partner in the Science for Peace and Security Programme
 -- Approving a package of five training courses to be held at the NATO-Istanbul Cooperation Initiative
    Regional Centre in Kuwait in the fields of cyber defence, energy security and chemical, biological,
    radiological and nuclear defence
 2017 saw further expansion of the Programme’s work with NATO partners in the Balkans and across
 the globe:
 -- A multi-year project in Western Balkan countries to improve their crisis management and emergency
    response capabilities through a Next Generation Incident Command System
 -- A table-top exercise on chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear defence took place in Japan
 -- Experts from New Zealand contributing to projects on perceptions of NATO in the Asia-Pacific region and
    the role of small states in international security
 -- A cyber defence capacity building project with Mongolia

Exercise BOSNA I HERCEGOVINA 2017

In addition to its day-to-day activities, the Euro-Atlantic Disaster Response Coordination Centre conducts
annual large-scale field exercises to improve interoperability between civilian and military actors in NATO and
partner countries.

In September 2017, the Centre and the Ministry of Security of Bosnia and Herzegovina co-organised the 17th
consequence management field exercise in Tuzla. The country was hit by devastating floods and landslides in
2014. The lessons identified after this disaster included the need to organise more multinational exercises to
strengthen interoperability.

Around 1,200 people were involved in the exercise. They came from Bosnia and Herzegovina, 34 Allied and
partner nations, and 12 international organisations and bodies, including the Joint CBRN Defence Centre of
Excellence and the EU Emergency Response Coordination Centre.

The exercise included innovations such as virtual reality technology and a simulated social media platform.
A multinational telemedicine system was also used to allow medical personnel in the field to reach back and
get critical advice from medical experts across the world, using man-portable telemedicine kits. An incident
command system, supporting partner nations in the Western Balkans and developed under the NATO Science
for Peace and Security Programme, was also tested during the exercise and helped to better coordinate
emergency response through the provision of real-time information about the unfolding fictitious disaster. Also,
training on the protection of civilians in a complex emergency was offered to participants.

Orange the World
In 2017, NATO joined the United Nations’ ‘Orange Campaign’: 16 days of activism against gender-based
violence. NATO helped to raise awareness on this important topic, aiming to influence people to take action to
end violence against women.

                                                    at a panel discussion about 'Women, Peace and Security', Brussels, December 2017.




 Why NATO must defend women's rights
 In a December 2017 joint Op-Ed, the NATO Secretary General and Angelina Jolie, the UN Special Envoy,
 called for an end to gender-based violence and outlined a way for NATO to play a leading role in that effort.
 They affirmed NATO should:
 -- Deepen its commitment to integrating gender issues into its strategic thinking and reinforce a culture of
    integration of women throughout the Organization including in leadership positions
 -- Train others on the protection of human rights and civilians, including against sexual violence and
    promoting standard operating practices for soldiers in the field to prevent, recognise and respond to sexual
    and gender-based violence
 -- Invest in its gender advisors and in boosting gender-based violence reporting and monitoring mechanisms
 'It is humanity’s shame that violence against women, whether in peaceful societies or during times of war,
 has been universally regarded as a lesser crime. There is finally hope that we can change this. We owe it to
 ourselves – men and women alike – and to future generations.'

Gender Balance Statistics
Despite progress, there is still more work to be done to boost the representation of women at NATO, especially
in senior-level posts. In 2017, the percentage of women remained 26% NATO-wide, 39% within the International
Staff, and 16% within the International Military Staff at NATO Headquarters. Overall, 21% of senior leadership
positions within the International Staff are held by women8.

Among the initiatives designed to address this issue is the NATO Women’s Professional Network and Mentoring
Programme, which launched its third cycle in 2017. The Programme aims to develop a pool of qualified female
candidates and remove any structural barriers that may exist between staff.

In the North Atlantic Council, nine of NATO’s Permanent Representatives are women9, with eight women serving
as Ministers of Defence in NATO member countries at the end of 201710.

In 2017, the NATO International Military Staff Office of the Gender Advisor collected national data on women in
the armed forces of member countries in 2016. This showed that 96% of NATO members have all positions in
their armed forces open to women (compared to 84% in 2015); and that the average percentage of women in
the armed forces of NATO countries remains at 11%. The data also show that 7% of military personnel deployed
in NATO operations in 2016 were women (compared to 6% in 2015).

Other important trends reflected in the report include:

-- 66.7% of NATO members have support in place for single, divorced or widowed parents caring for children
   (compared to 48% in 2015)
-- 59.3% of NATO members have programmes or policies to encourage work-life balance (compared to 52% in
   2015)
-- 77.8% of NATO members have a military entity dealing with gender perspectives (compared to 72% in 2015).

              defence budgets (in most countries) according to
              agreed cost shares. The Military Budget is approved
              by the Council, overseen by the Budget Committee
              (with representatives from all NATO member
              countries) and implemented by the individual budget
              holders. The Military Budget ceiling for 2017 was
              EUR 1.3 billion. In all cases, military personnel are
              provided to NATO by the countries they serve and
              are funded through their national defence budgets.

Defence Expenditure of NATO Countries (2010 – 2017)

NATO collects defence expenditure data from Allies on a regular basis and presents aggregates and subsets of this
information. Each Ally’s Ministry of Defence reports current and estimated future defence expenditure according to an
agreed definition of defence expenditure. The amounts represent payments by a national government actually made, or
to be made, during the course of the fiscal year to meet the needs of its armed forces, those of Allies or of the Alliance.
NATO also makes use of up-to-date economic and demographic information available from the Directorate-General
for Economic and Financial Affairs of the European Commission, and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation
and Development.
In view of differences between the definition of NATO defence expenditure and national definitions, the figures shown
in this report may diverge considerably from those which are quoted by media, published by national authorities or
given in national budgets. Equipment expenditure includes expenditure on major equipment as well as on research and
development devoted to major equipment. Personnel expenditure includes pensions paid to retirees.
The cut-off date for information used in this report is 9 February 2018. Figures for 2017 are estimates.
