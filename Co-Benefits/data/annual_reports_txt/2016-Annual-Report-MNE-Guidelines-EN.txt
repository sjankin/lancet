EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Executive summary
Celebrating 40 years of the Guidelines
The year 2016 marked the 40 year anniversary of the OECD Guidelines for
Multinational Enterprises (hereinafter Guidelines) and a number of events took place last
year to celebrate this occasion. Since 1976, the number of OECD and non-OECD
countries adhering to the Declaration (Adherents) has grown from 24 to 46.1 Today, this
includes the 35 OECD countries and 11 non-OECD countries. The global reach and
impact of the Guidelines has significantly increased and today they are the leading
standard on responsible business conduct (RBC) worldwide. The Guidelines are stronger
and more sophisticated than 40 years ago thanks, in part, to their continuous adjustment
to global economic changes, the breadth of their coverage, their unique grievance
mechanism, the inclusion of global supply chains, and the strong involvement of
stakeholders.

Legislative and policy developments
In 2016, several important developments took place in policy and legislation which
support further implementation of the Guidelines. The Council of Europe’s
Recommendation of the Committee of Ministers to member States on human rights and
business included references to the Guidelines as a risk assessment framework and
encouraged Council of Europe member states to take steps to adhere to and/or implement
the Guidelines. The Council of Europe also encouraged Adherents to the Declaration to
ensure the effectiveness of their National Contact Points (NCP).2 The International
Labour Conference addressed decent work in global supply chains and the ILO
Governing Body adopted a 5 year programme of action which promotes partnership with
the OECD.
Pending legislative proposals relevant to the Guidelines also made progress in 2016.
The deadline for transposition of the European Union (EU) Directive 2014/95/EU on
disclosure of non-financial and diversity information by certain large undertakings and
groups was December 2016. Several EU members were active in promoting the
Guidelines as a framework for transposition. In France, a legislative proposal which aims
to mandate supply chain due diligence in accordance with the Guidelines was sent to the
French Senate for a further reading. Final adoption by the French National Assembly took
place in early 2017. A petition proposing mandatory human rights due diligence was
presented to the Swiss government and is currently under discussion in the Federal
Council. In November, the European Parliament, Commission and Council reached an
informal agreement on the content of an EU Regulation on tin, tantalum, tungsten and
gold which is based on approaches recommended by the OECD Due Diligence Guidance
for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas
(Minerals Guidance).3

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The trend of inclusion of RBC criteria in trade and investment agreements continued
throughout 2016 and references to the Guidelines were included in the European UnionCanada Economic and Trade Agreement, the European Union-Viet Nam Free Trade
Agreement and the Free Trade Agreement between the European Free Trade Association
and Georgia.
Six export credit agencies (ECAs) (Austria, Canada, the Netherlands, Slovenia,
Sweden/SEK and the United States) reported having a formal process for considering
statements or reports from their NCP.4 Germany, Italy, Switzerland and the United States
completed a National Action Plan on Business and Human Rights/RBC (NAP) in 2016
and the United Kingdom updated an existing NAP. All NAPs completed in 2016 include
reference to the Guidelines and NCP mechanism.

National Contact Points
All Adherents to the Guidelines are required to set up an NCP to further the
effectiveness of the Guidelines. As of end-2016, 44 of the 46 Adherents had an NCP in
place. The two exceptions are Egypt and Tunisia who do not appear to have an NCP
contact, a website or any NCP-related activity.
NCPs have the mandate of furthering the effectiveness of the Guidelines by
undertaking promotional activities, handling enquiries and contributing to the resolution
of issues related to the Guidelines in specific instances. Handling grievances related to
non-observance of the Guidelines (“specific instances”) is a unique feature of the
Guidelines.
In 2016, 34 new specific instances were submitted to NCPs and 38 specific instances
were closed, including specific instances submitted during and before 2016. Of these, 24
were concluded and 14 were not accepted.5 Some form of agreement was reached in nine
specific instances accounting for 60% of all concluded specific instances where mediation
occurred (15 specific instances). Agreements reached amongst parties in 2016 often
included the development of a remediation plan, or changes to a company's operations
and policies to mitigate impacts.
Nine (37%) of the concluded specific instances resulted in some change to company
policy or operations to better meet the recommendations of the Guidelines. These
changes included strengthening corporate policies on human rights, improving due
diligence processes as well as improving reporting processes and transparency standards.
Of the 34 new specific instances, several submissions were to NCPs which had
previously received few or no cases. This included four cases to the NCP of Italy, two
cases to the NCP of Colombia, and two cases to the NCP of Morocco. The financial
sector continued to be a sector in which most specific instances were raised for the second
year in a row, accounting for over 20% of all new submissions. The chapter on Human
Rights continues to be the most cited Guidelines chapter in specific instances, in line with
historical trends.
One of the key functions of NCPs in addition to handling specific instances is to
promote the Guidelines. A total of 25 NCPs have created a promotional plan for the
Guidelines and 35 NCPs either held or attended promotional events during 2016. Most
governments have made their NCP visible, e.g. via a dedicated website and, since the last
reporting period, four NCPs have created a website. A total of 33 NCPs have published
information on procedures on their website explaining the specific instance process.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

There are currently three adhering governments that do not have a website in place on the
Guidelines or the NCP.
NCPs are required to meet regularly to share experiences, and report to the
Investment Committee. Most NCPs fulfilled these obligations. Forty-one NCPs attended
the meetings of NCPs in both June and November 2016. A total of 5 NCPs did not attend
the meetings of NCPs in either June or November and two NCPs did not report.
In 2016, a calendar of peer reviews for 2016-18 was created and the peer review of
Belgium was finalised. The on-site visits for the reviews of Italy and Switzerland took
place in 2016. Two capacity-building missions took place to Jordan and Kazakhstan.
Both missions focused on the development of an NCP and the role of RBC in the
respective countries.

Due diligence to implement the Guidelines
Sector specific applications of the Guidelines saw significant developments in 2016.
Sector projects include work on responsible mineral supply chains, agricultural supply
chains, and garment and footwear supply chains, as well as projects on stakeholder
engagement in the extractive sector and RBC in the financial sector.
A new draft Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Business Conduct across
sectors was a major addition to the supply chain due diligence work in 2016. The draft
Due Diligence Guidance draws from the sector projects, which provide more detailed
recommendations tailored to the specific risks in those sectors.
For the minerals sector, in addition to the European Union regulation discussed
above, in April 2016, the Chinese Chamber of Commerce for Metals, Minerals and
Chemicals Importers and Exporters (CCCMC) and the OECD organised a workshop on
responsible cobalt, leading to the development of the Responsible Cobalt Initiative in
November 2016. This initiative builds off the recommendations of the Minerals Guidance
and the Chinese Due Diligence Guidelines for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals.
In May 2016 the Council adopted the Recommendation of the Council on the OECDFAO Guidance for Responsible Agriculture Supply Chains and in July, the
Recommendation of the Council on the Due Diligence Guidance for Meaningful
Stakeholder Engagement in the Extractive Sector. The OECD Due Diligence Guidance
for Responsible Supply Chains in the Garment and Footwear Sector was approved by the
OECD Working Party on Responsible Business Conduct in November 2016 and the
OECD Investment Committee in January 2017.
The paper titled Responsible business conduct for institutional investors was
unanimously endorsed by the multi-stakeholder advisory group of over 50 representatives
from the financial sector in December 2016. The OECD Working Party on Responsible
Business Conduct approved the paper on 23 January 2017, followed by the OECD
Investment Committee on 8 February 2017.
The G7 Agricultural Ministers’ Meeting Declaration of April 2016 welcomed the
OECD-FAO Guidance for Responsible Agricultural Supply Chains and encouraged its
observance by companies.6

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Outreach and co-operation with partners
The focus on promoting dialogue and deepening engagement on RBC with nonMembers who have not adhered to the OECD Declaration on Investment and
Multinational Enterprises (Declaration) was maintained throughout 2016. This has been
one of the top priorities of the OECD Secretariat since the Guidelines were updated in
2011 and co-operation has continued with a number of key countries, either through
regional, country, or sector programmes, as well as the annual Global Forum on
Responsible Business Conduct (GFRBC) or the sector-specific forums and roundtables
organised by the OECD. The focus on Asia as a priority for outreach is expected to
continue over the medium-term. RBC is now systematically integrated in OECD
investment reviews and the OECD institutional framework for how RBC is considered in
relation to adherence and accession was strengthened.
The GFRBC held on 8-9 June 2016 at the OECD in Paris, brought together over 80
speakers and 750 participants from governments, businesses, trade unions, and civil
society. The main themes of 2016 included: achieving real impact through better business
practices, anticipating emerging issues in supply chains, and promoting a better
contribution of the private sector to the achievement of SDGs. The 2016 GFRBC also
included, for the first time, a High-Level Roundtable for Policy-Makers on 7 June 2016.
The Roundtable provided a space for dialogue among policy-makers to discuss ways to
effectively design, promote and implement policies and instruments to promote RBC.
OECD also promotes dialogue through sector-specific forums and roundtables, e.g. the
10th ICGLR-OECD-UN GoE Forum on Responsible Mineral Supply Chains held on
10-12 May 2016 at the OECD in Paris.

Measuring the impact of responsible business conduct
In 2016, the OECD launched two projects to measure the impact of RBC. The first
project, conducted jointly with Columbia University, developed a framework to measure
the costs and benefits of due diligence for businesses. The second project, which is still
underway, aims to develop a core set of indicators in the minerals supply chain which
could help practitioners track results on the ground. The OECD also organised a session
on results measurement at the 2016 GFRBC and published evidence of the impacts of
RBC on companies' performance in the 2016 edition of the OECD Development Cooperation Report.

Chapter 1
Celebrating 40 years of the Guidelines
The year 2016 marked the 40 year anniversary of the OECD Guidelines for
Multinational Enterprises (hereafter the “Guidelines”). Since their adoption in 1976, the
global reach and impact of the Guidelines has significantly increased and today they are
the leading instrument on responsible business conduct (RBC) worldwide. A number of
events took place to celebrate the 40 years of the Guidelines. These included a range of
seminars and conferences organised by National Contact Points (NCPs), as well as a
dialogue between the Council and the Chair of the Investment Committee and the Chair
of the WPRBC on 20 October and two Roundtables organised by the OECD and partners
in September and December (Table 1).
These events provided an opportunity for a wide range of stakeholders from
government, business, workers, civil society, international organisations and academia to
reflect on the history, role and future of the Guidelines.

1. CELEBRATING 40 YEARS OF THE GUIDELINES

Adaptation to changes in the global economy
Throughout their lifetime the Guidelines have continuously adjusted to global
economic changes while advancing the responsibility of business towards society. 7 The
events leading to the coup d'état in Chile in 1973 triggered international discussions on
the power of multinational enterprises in host countries8 and culminated in the adoption
of the OECD Declaration on Investment and Multinational Enterprises in 1976. The
Declaration offered a balanced approach to investment both granting rights to, and
expecting certain standards of behaviour from investors: adhering governments would
provide national treatment to foreign investors in reciprocation of an expectation that they
behave responsibly, in line with the recommendations of the Guidelines.9
The initial momentum of the Guidelines somewhat faded in the 1980s and 1990s as
attention within OECD countries shifted to investment protection and liberalisation.10
Increasing calls to accompany the opening up of global markets with social measures led
to the inclusion of the Guidelines in the draft text of the Multilateral Agreement on
Investment (MAI), but the negotiations on this agreement failed in November 1998. In
turn, the Guidelines revived as a result of their revision in 2000. In this revision, the scope
of the Guidelines was significantly broadened as Adherents were now expected to
promote RBC among their MNEs operating in or from their territories, hence placing the
same expectation on foreign and domestic investors.11
To keep up with the rise of global value chains and enterprises restructuring their
operations internationally through outsourcing and offshoring of activities, the Guidelines
were further strengthened in the 2011 revision to include an expectation that business not
only behave responsibly in the context of their own operations but also across their
business relationships and supply chains. This paved the way for the so-called "Proactive
Agenda" that has expanded the OECD's work on supply chain due diligence and the
development of sector-specific guidance instruments.
In 2015, the OECD Policy Framework for Investment (PFI) was updated to include a
strengthened chapter with recommendations on how governments can enable RBC
through regulation, facilitation, cooperation, promotion and leading by example.12 The
PFI and the Guidelines have thus become an integral part of the OECD's approach to
sustainable investment policy.

Substantive coverage
Another feature of the Guidelines is that they have continuously evolved to reflect the
broad and cross-cutting scope of RBC, with business impacts on society, both positive
and negative, covering a range of issues. The first edition of the Guidelines addressed the
main issue of discussion at the time, namely employment and labour relations.13 As part
of the third revision in 1991 a chapter on environmental protection was added, which was
followed by chapters on combatting bribery and the protection of consumer interests in
the revision of 2000. The 2011 review of the Guidelines led to the inclusion of a standalone chapter on human rights aligned with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and
Human Rights.
Throughout their five revisions, the Guidelines have expanded to address salient
substantive areas with respect to business ethics, and have been aligned with major
international instruments in the respective fields, including United Nations instruments on
human rights and international environmental agreements, as well as the Convention on
12

1. CELEBRATING 40 YEARS OF THE GUIDELINES

Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions
and the G20/OECD Principles of Corporate Governance.14 Traditionally the labour
chapter has been closely linked to the ILO fundamental Conventions and the ILO
Tripartite Declaration of Principles concerning Multinational Enterprises and Social
Policy of 1977. This “umbrella approach” of the Guidelines makes it the most
comprehensive international instrument on RBC.

Grievance mechanism
The Guidelines are the only corporate responsibility instrument that has a built-in
grievance mechanism, the National Contact Points (NCPs). The NCPs act as a forum for
discussion for all matters relating to the Guidelines and contribute to the resolution of
issues that arise relating to implementation of the Guidelines.
Although dispute resolution was inherently linked to the Guidelines since their
inception, it was not until the 2000 revision of the Guidelines that a process for dispute
resolution was articulated. Historically, the predecessor of the Investment Committee was
vested with the review and consultation procedure relating to the application of the
Guidelines.15 Although this procedure was not designed as a grievance mechanism, a
number of cases were brought to the attention of the Committee by TUAC in the first
years of the Guidelines. The first one was the 1977 "Badger case".16 At the end of the
1970s Members started to set up national facilities for handling enquiries and for
discussion on issues relating to the Guidelines.17 The second revision of the Guidelines in
1984 included for the first time an obligation to set up a National Contact Point "for
undertaking promotional activities, handling enquiries and for discussions with the parties
concerned on all matters related to the Guidelines so that they can contribute to the
solution of problems which may arise in this connection."18
In the 1980s a number of NCPs were established and handled the first specific
instances, which totalled around 44 by the end of the 1990s. However, overall, their
functioning was affected by the fading attention to the Guidelines during that period.19
The NCP system revived as a result of the 2000 revision, and the inclusion of a detailed
Procedural Guidance on the role and functions of NCPs. This gave them a stronger role to
deal with all matters relating to the Guidelines, including resolving issues related to the
non-observance of the Guidelines by companies.20 Since 2001 NCPs have been dealing
with an increasing amount of cases. To date, more than 400 specific instances have been
handled by NCPs, addressing impacts from business operations in over 100 countries and
territories. The institutional arrangements of NCPs have also evolved from purely
government-based structures to include tripartite, quadripartite and also independent
agency structures.21
The role of NCPs in supporting the implementation of the Guidelines was reinforced
during the last update of the Guidelines in 2011.22 In 2015 calls were made by OECD
Ministers and G7 Leaders to strengthen the performance of NCPs, including through
voluntary peer reviews and the exchange of best practices. This resulted in the creation of
an OECD Action Plan to strengthen NCPs, which focuses on peer reviews and capacity
building, peer learning and the development of tools to support NCPs in delivering their
mandate. The Action Plan was approved by the Investment Committee in early 2016. In
December 2016 the Secretary General of the OECD sent letters to Ministers of all
Adherents to the Investment Declaration recognising the performance of their NCPs,
encouraging NCPs to volunteer for peer reviews or capacity-building and signalling
efforts to strengthen the NCP network.

1. CELEBRATING 40 YEARS OF THE GUIDELINES

Responsible global supply chains
Another major success of the Guidelines is the expanding work on due diligence for
responsible global supply chains. This began in 2009 with respect to responsible mineral
supply chains following calls from the G8 and the International Conference in the Great
Lakes Region to help develop a framework to enable responsible sourcing of minerals
from conflict-affected and high risk areas.23 A multi-stakeholder collaboration, involving
OECD countries, non-OECD countries, the private sector and civil society led to the
development of the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of
Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas in 2011.24 Today, its
implementation programme involves over 500 stakeholders and has managed to
effectively engage in outreach with non-Adherents that play important roles in global
mineral supply chains, including also the People’s Republic of China (China).
The approach promoted by the work on responsible minerals supply chains has
inspired the development by the OECD of guidance for companies operating in other
sectors. When the Guidelines were updated in 2011, the multi-stakeholder approach of
the minerals implementation programme inspired the inclusion of a specific mandate for
the Investment Committee to pursue a ‘proactive agenda’ to support implementation of
RBC in specific sectors.25 The WPRBC subsequently initiated sector-specific projects in
the agriculture, extractives, garment and footwear, and financial sectors, driven by
demand from stakeholders and supported by multi-stakeholder advisory groups. The year
2016 was a momentous year as Recommendation of the Council on the OECD-FAO
Guidance for Responsible Agricultural Supply Chains and the Recommendation of the
Council on the Due Diligence Guidance for Meaningful Stakeholder Engagement in the
Extractives Sector were adopted, and the Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply
Chains in the Garment and Footwear Sector and the paper on "Responsible business
conduct for institutional investors" was finalised.

Stakeholder involvement
Central to the evolution and the success of the Guidelines is the importance of the
participatory process involving governments, business, trade unions and civil society. The
Decision of the Council on the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises (Decision
on the Guidelines) recognised the Business and Industry Advisory Committee (BIAC)
and the Trade Union Advisory Committee (TUAC) as advisory bodies.26 As a result of
the 2000 revision of the Guidelines, OECD Watch, an international network of more than
80 civil society organisations was added as a third international partner that the
Investment Committee periodically invites to express their views on matters covered by
the Guidelines. Throughout its 40 years of existence, stakeholders have played a critical
role in drawing attention to areas in need of improvement, bringing specific instances to
the NCP system and generally promoting the Guidelines in their activities. Their efforts
to improve the functioning of NCPs led to a unique joint statement in October 2015
calling on the OECD to establish an effective peer review programme and on
governments to sufficiently resource their NCPs.27 The effective engagement with
stakeholders continues to be a pillar of all work related to the Guidelines (see also the
statements by institutional stakeholders set out in Annex 10).

1. CELEBRATING 40 YEARS OF THE GUIDELINES

Legal nature
The Guidelines are recommendations addressed by governments to multinational
enterprises. Efforts to confer a binding nature on the Guidelines failed in the early years
of their introduction.28 As such the instrument is voluntary in nature; however, Adherents
are bound to set up a functioning NCP by virtue of the Decision on the Guidelines which
is legally binding on Adherents.
The last decade has witnessed an increasing uptake of the Guidelines and its related
due diligence instruments in international and national policy and legislation. Key aspects
of the Guidelines have been incorporated into national laws and EU regulations. The
Guidelines have also become a cornerstone of the EU trade strategy29 and have been
consistently referenced in trade and investment agreements,30 but also in development
policy and in National Action Plans on Business and Human Rights. These developments
have helped raise the profile of the Guidelines and contributed to widespread awareness
of the evolving expectations regarding RBC.
Since their inception, the Guidelines have steadily become stronger and more
sophisticated thanks to their continuous adjustment to global economic changes, the
breath of their substantive coverage, their unique grievance mechanism, their coverage of
global supply chains, the involvement of stakeholders and their legal nature. Since 1976,
the number of Adherents has grown from 24 to 4631, which includes the 35 OECD
Members and 11 non-Members. To maintain the position of the Guidelines as a leading
global standard on business responsibility, a future challenge will be to respond to the
2015 Ministerial Council Statement’s call to widen adherence to the MNE Guidelines and
to ensure that the Guidelines continue responding to the expectations of society.32

2. LEGISLATIVE AND POLICY DEVELOPMENTS IN SUPPORT OF THE GUIDELINES

Chapter 2
Legislative and policy developments in support of the Guidelines
In 2016, RBC has continued to be integrated into domestic and international policy
and regulations. There have been important developments with respect to pending
legislative proposals on RBC, and several new policy initiatives have been introduced
that promote RBC and make reference to the Guidelines.

Responsible business conduct in high-level statements
RBC is an important tool in promoting sustainable trade and investment as the
industries and supply chains that entail the most severe risks are often relied on by the
poorest and most vulnerable segments of the population for their livelihoods. Under the
Guidelines business are encouraged to engage in ongoing risk-mitigation rather than
disengage at first sign of potential environmental or social risks within their supply chain,
promoting inclusive growth and development.
The G20 Leaders’ Communique of 2016 acknowledged “the important role of
inclusive business in development.”33 The G20 Guiding Principles for Global Investment
Policymaking adopted in 2016 also recognised that “[i]nvestment policies should promote
and facilitate the observance by investors of international best practices and applicable
instruments of responsible business conduct and corporate governance.”34 A report on
Strengthening Responsible Business Conduct through Trade and Investment was
developed in response to a mandate included in the 2015 Ministerial statement which
called on the OECD to analyse how sustainability and RBC can be promoted through
trade and investment.35 The report was submitted to the 2016 OECD Meeting of the
Council at the Ministerial level to support the discussion on Strengthening the
Contribution of Trade and Investment to Productivity and Inclusiveness. The 2016 OECD
Ministerial Council Statement called on the OECD “to continue promoting strong RBC,
notably the MNE Guidelines, strengthening the functioning of the National Contact
Points, and fostering work on due diligence in relevant sectors, such as agricultural
supply chains, to encourage inclusive, responsible and sustainable growth.”36
In addition to promoting inclusive growth, the Guidelines were recognised as an
important risk management tool. The Recommendation of the Committee of Ministers to
member States on human rights and business adopted by the Council of Europe in March
of 2016, references the Guidelines as a framework against which to assess risks in the
context of commercial trade missions. It also calls on Council of Europe’s members to
ensure alignment with the OECD Risk Awareness Tool for Multinational Enterprises in
Weak Governance Zones and the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply
Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas in carrying out
operations in conflict-affected areas, and in other sectors or areas that involve a high risk
of negative impacts on human rights.37

2. LEGISLATIVE AND POLICY DEVELOPMENTS IN SUPPORT OF THE GUIDELINES

The Recommendation also included language encouraging European Union members
to take steps to adhere to and/or implement the Guidelines and, for Adherents to the
Declaration, to ensure the effectiveness of their National Contact Points (NCPs).38 This
call was echoed by the European Parliament. A European Parliament resolution on
implementation of the 2010 recommendations of Parliament on social and environmental
standards, human rights and corporate responsibility, adopted on 5 July 2016, recalled
“Parliament’s request from 2010 to include CSR in all EU trade agreements and
provisions for greater enforcement, notably the possibility for the Commission to carry
out investigations into alleged breaches of CSR commitments and the development of EU
contact points building on and strengthening the OECD contact points.”39 The resolution
also asked the EU Commission “to step up its efforts towards achieving compliance by
companies, throughout their supply chains, and full respect for ILO core labour standards
and internationally recognised CSR standards, in particular the recently updated OECD
Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises.”40

Alignment across international instruments
In March 2016, the Governing Body of the International Labour Organisation (ILO)
agreed to review the ILO Tripartite Declaration of Principles concerning Multinational
Enterprises and Social Policy to take account of developments within and outside the
ILO since its last revision in 2006.41 Relevant developments include the introduction of
the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and the UN Sustainable
Development Goals. The review also took into account the conclusions of the 2016
International Labour Conference (ILC) on decent work in global supply chains. The
Governing Body approved the revised Tripartite Declaration in March 2017.42
The ILC which took place in June 2016 held a general discussion to consider the
opportunities and challenges for the realisation of decent work and inclusive development
emerging from global supply chains.43 The Conference concluded that the ILO should
work in partnership with other international organisations including the OECD to advance
decent work in global supply chains and "take into account international frameworks […]
such as the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises."44 The Conference
conclusions also addressed strengthened cooperation between the NCPs and the ILO, by
stating that: "the ILO should, taking into account the function and the geographical scope
of OECD National Contact Points, upon request, provide expertise to the NCPs on social
and labour standards. Within the review process of the MNE Declaration, it should
consider the setting up of mechanisms to address disputes.”45
To follow-up on the ILC mandate, in November 2016 the ILO Governing Body
adopted a 5 year programme of action (2017-2021) to guide the work of the ILO. The
programme of action promotes partnership with the OECD to advance decent work in
global supply chains, tasks the ILO to play a leading role to ensure coherent
implementation of the labour and employment components of the OECD Guidelines, and
refers to proposals to be presented to the Governing Body in March 2017 for a system
and process with which the ILO can best provide expertise to the NCPs upon request.46
The 2016 Development Co-operation Report of the OECD recognised the important
role of RBC in supporting the global development agenda.47 The report explores how the
UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) can be realistically attained including
through raising sufficient financing and promoting sustainable and inclusive growth. A
chapter on promoting sustainable development through RBC outlines how
18

-----------------------Page 20 End-----------------------

2. LEGISLATIVE AND POLICY DEVELOPMENTS IN SUPPORT OF THE GUIDELINES

implementation of the Guidelines can support the SDGs, and can strengthen inclusiveness
and participation in global value chains.
A June 2016 report by the UN Working Group on Business and Human Rights to the
UN Human Rights Council examined the duty of States to protect against human rights
abuses involving those business enterprises that they own or control. The report found
that there is a general lack of attention to RBC issues and has called on states to explicitly
fill these gaps among state-owned enterprises (SOEs). The Guidelines (including National
Contact Points) and the Recommendation of the Council on Guidelines on Corporate
Governance of State-Owned Enterprises are prominently referenced both throughout the
report and as a basis for future work on this topic.48 The OECD has already begun
integrating these considerations into Investment Policy Reviews of countries that have
large SOE activity, most recently in reviews of Ukraine (2016) Kazakhstan (2015) and
Viet Nam (forthcoming).

Legislative developments promoting the Guidelines
2016 saw important developments made with respect to several pending legislative
proposals on RBC.
The deadline for transposing the EU Directive 2014/95/EU on disclosure of nonfinancial and diversity information by certain large undertakings and groups (hereinafter
“EU Directive”) for EU members was 6 December 2016.49 The EU Directive promotes
implementation of the recommendations of the Guidelines by referencing them as a
framework which companies can rely upon in fulfilling their reporting obligations under
the Directive and by including an expectation that companies report on their due diligence
systems and outcomes. Alignment between the EU Directive and the Guidelines is helpful
both for promoting the recommendations of the Guidelines as well as facilitating
compliance with the Directive, as the majority of EU members are already committed to
implementing the recommendations of the Guidelines.
Some countries have been active in promoting the Guidelines as a framework for
transposition. For example the NCP of Italy has been involved in the transposition of the
EU Directive in Italy, which was completed through a Decree on 23 December 2016. The
NCP launched a national working group and hosted several consultations on nonfinancial disclosure as well as on supply chain due diligence in line with the Guidelines.
A legislative proposal which aims to mandate supply chain due diligence in
accordance with the Guidelines is currently under consideration in France.50 This proposal
was first introduced in February of 2015. If enacted, it would require companies to
develop and publish a due diligence plan for human rights, and environmental and social
risks. The law would apply to all French companies employing 5 000 employees or more
domestically or 10 000 employees or more internationally. The proposal was endorsed by
the French National Assembly in March 2015, but rejected by the French Senate in
November 2015. Some modifications were made to the proposal and it was approved
again by the Assembly National after a second reading on 29 November 2016. The
proposal was sent to the French Senate for another reading and final adoption by the
French National Assembly took place in February of 2017.51 However members of
Parliament submitted the proposal to the French Constitutional Court which will have to
validate the Bill before it can enter into force.
In 2015 a motion proposing human rights and environmental due diligence for Swiss
corporations was put forth in Switzerland. The motion was narrowly voted down in the

2. LEGISLATIVE AND POLICY DEVELOPMENTS IN SUPPORT OF THE GUIDELINES

Swiss Parliament; however, a popular referendum was launched on the proposal and
120 000 signatures were collected as of 10 October 2016.52 The petition proposing
mandatory human rights due diligence was presented to the Swiss government and is
currently under discussion in the Federal Council. It will be put up to vote by the public
in 2019.
Since 2014 the EU has been in the process of adopting a regulation on conflict
minerals. Under the regulation EU consuming markets will be covered by legal
provisions to promote supply chain due diligence for products containing tin, tantalum,
tungsten or gold. In November of 2016, the European Parliament, Commission and
Council reached an informal agreement on content of EU Regulation on conflict minerals
which is based on approaches recommended in the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for
Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas. 53
The OECD provided technical assistance in development of this regulation (See Chapter
4 of this report). The EU Parliament and the International Trade Committee are expected
to formally adopt the text in May 2017. Under the current text the regulation will be
applicable in all EU members as of 1 January 2021.

Policy support for RBC in sectors
In March 2016 the Dutch government and a broad coalition of industry organisations,
trade unions and civil society organisations adopted the Sustainable Garment and Textile
Agreement.54 The agreement seeks to promote responsible business practices and
recognises the Guidelines as the starting point for RBC. The agreement also makes
reference to the supply chain due diligence approach of the OECD’s Due Diligence
Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains in the Garment and Footwear Sector, and
identifies this guidance as the appropriate framework for SMEs in this sector.
In October of 2016 the Dutch government published a similar agreement in the
context of the banking sector. The Dutch Banking Sector Agreement on international
responsible business conduct regarding human rights makes significant reference to the
Guidelines including by stating that “individual banks have the responsibility to respect
human rights in conformity with the OECD Guidelines,” that signatories agree to
“implement and embed their responsibility to respect human rights in their operations and
confirm to act in conformity with the OECD Guidelines” and to “implement human rights
due diligence in their operations in conformity with the OECD Guidelines.” 55 The
agreement also makes specific reference to the ongoing work of the WPRBC on due
diligence in the financial sector56 (See Chapter 4).

RBC in economic instruments
RBC and export credits
Paragraph 16 of the OECD Recommendation of the Council on Common Approaches
for Officially Supported Export Credits and Environmental and Social Due Diligence
states that, when undertaking a review, Adherents should, where appropriate, “consider
any statements or reports made publicly available by their National Contact Points
(NCPs) at the conclusion of a specific instance procedure under the OECD Guidelines for
Multinational Enterprises.”57

-----------------------Page 22 End-----------------------

2. LEGISLATIVE AND POLICY DEVELOPMENTS IN SUPPORT OF THE GUIDELINES

Members of the OECD Working Party on Export Credits and Credit Guarantees
(ECG) submit an annual survey on their environmental and social policies, including
implementation of Paragraph 16 of the Common Approaches.
In 2016 six ECAs (Austria, Canada, the Netherlands, Slovenia, Sweden/SEK and the
United States) reported having a formal process for considering, where appropriate, any
statements or reports from their NCP: for example, in the United States, all applications
must be “cleared” by the US Department of State, which houses the NCP. In addition, 21
other ECAs reported that they have processes in place; however, from the responses it
would appear that these are more ad hoc than formal, although some ECAs commented
that they have established regular contacts with the NCPs in order to exchange
information about on-going projects.58 This represents an increase over last year where 25
Adherents reported having processes in place at the level of their ECAs to consider NCP
statements.59
Three ECAs (the Czech Republic, New Zealand and Turkey) reported that they do not
have any such policies or procedures in place. Two ECAs (Denmark and Spain) reported
that they are in the process of developing specific policies and procedures with regard to
considering any statements or reports from their NCP.60

RBC in trade and investment agreements
The trend of inclusion of RBC criteria in trade and investment agreements has
continued throughout 2016.61
The EU-Canada Economic and Trade Agreement signed in September 2016 includes
several references to the Guidelines and related instruments, including in the preamble
and in the context of cooperation and promotion of trade supporting sustainable
development. It also encourages activities that support the OECD Guidelines for
Multinational Enterprises and the Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply
Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas as an internationally
recognised standard in the context of their bilateral dialogue on raw minerals.62
The EU-Viet Nam Free Trade Agreement, agreed as of January 2016 includes
references to the Guidelines in the context of trade and sustainable development noting
that “the Parties[…]agree to promote corporate social responsibility (CSR),[…] In this
regard, each Party takes into account relevant internationally accepted and agreed
instruments, that have been endorsed or are supported by the Party, such as the OECD
Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, the UN Global Compact, the ILO Tripartite
Declaration of Principles concerning Multinational Enterprises and Social Policy.”63
The Free Trade Agreement between the EFTA States64 and Georgia was concluded in
2016 and notes the Guidelines in its preamble acknowledging “the importance of good
corporate governance and corporate social responsibility for sustainable development,
and affirming their aim to encourage enterprises to observe internationally recognised
guidelines and principles in this respect, such as the Organisation for Economic
Cooperation and Development (OECD) Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, the
OECD Principles of Corporate Governance [revised and embodied in an OECD
Recommendation in 2015 -and the United Nations (UN) Global Compact.”65

National Action Plans
Four Adherents to the Guidelines (Germany, Italy, Switzerland and the United States)
completed a National Action Plan on Business and Human Rights/RBC (NAP) in 2016

and one (United Kingdom) reported the completion of an updated NAP. All NAPs
completed in 2016 include references to the Guidelines and NCP mechanism. A total of
14 Adherents have now completed NAPs and 17 Adherents reported NAPs in progress
in 2016 (See Table 2 for more information). Additionally, while some countries do not
have official NAPs they may have RBC-related policies and strategies in place which
include elements similar to that of a NAP.

3. NATIONAL CONTACT POINTS

Chapter 3
National Contact Points
Background
All Adherents to the Declaration on International Investment and Multinational
Enterprises are also required to adhere to the Decision on the Guidelines. The Decision on
the Guidelines contains the legally binding obligation for Adherents to set up a National
Contact Point (NCP), to further the effectiveness of the Guidelines, and make human and
financial resources available to their NCP to fulfil their responsibilities. NCPs have the
mandate of furthering the effectiveness of the Guidelines by undertaking promotional
activities, handling enquiries and contributing to the resolution of issues related to the
Guidelines in specific instances. Handling grievances related to non-observance of the
Guidelines (“specific instances”) is a unique feature of the Guidelines.
Of the 46 Adherents, a total of 44 have an NCP in place, the exceptions being Egypt
and Tunisia who do not appear to have an NCP contact, a website or any NCP-related
activity. Neither country has reported to the OECD Investment Committee since 2014.
This chapter focuses on the activities of NCPs during the period January–December
2016. It is based on the responses to the annual reporting questionnaires submitted by the
NCPs covering activities up to 31 December 2016. Over the course of 2016, the OECD
Secretariat, in consultation with delegates from the WPRBC, revised the reporting
questionnaire for the annual reports of NCPs to facilitate more in-depth and accurate
reporting by NCPs, as well as better aggregation of information.
The chapter begins by providing an overview of specific instances closed and new
ones submitted within the reporting period, and addresses trends in handling specific
instances during that period. This is followed by a section addressing the current
structures of NCPs, including the involvement of Ministries and relevant staff and
financial resources. Following this, the chapter focuses on NCP activities conducted in
2016. An overview of NCPs in 2016 is provided in Annex 1.

Overview of specific instances handled during the reporting period
In 2016 there were 34 new specific instances submitted to NCPs and 38 specific
instances were closed including specific instances submitted during and before 2016. The
sections below give an overview of outcomes of closed cases and trends identified for
cases submitted in 2016.

3. NATIONAL CONTACT POINTS

Box 1. Terminology for the status of specific instances
Specific instances closed during the year include both specific instances that have been
concluded during the year and those that were not accepted during the year.
1.

Specific instances concluded during the year are those that the NCP found to merit
further examination after the initial assessment and that have subsequently been
closed. For such specific instances the NCP will have offered its “good offices” (e.g.
mediation/conciliation) to both parties.

2.

Specific instances not accepted during the year are those that the NCP found not to
merit further examination and that have therefore been closed.

Specific instances that are in progress are those that are not yet closed. These will include
submissions received by the NCP and under consideration, along with those accepted by the
NCP.

Overview and key outcomes of closed specific instances
A total of 38 specific instances were closed in this reporting period: 26 that were
already in progress as of January 2016 and 12 new ones which were submitted during
2016. Closed specific instances refers both to concluded cases (those found to merit
further examination after the initial assessment and subsequently finalised), and those that
are not accepted (see Box 1). Of the specific instances in progress as of January 2016, 15
were submitted prior to 2015.
Out of the 38 specific instances closed in this period, 24 were concluded and 14 were
not accepted.
Of the 24 concluded specific instances, 15 underwent mediation which in nine cases
resulted in some form of agreement between the parties. Six of the 15 did not result in
agreement despite the engagement of both parties in the process.

3. NATIONAL CONTACT POINTS

For the remaining nine concluded specific instances, mediation was refused by the
company involved in six specific instances. Mediation was not offered in two concluded
specific instances: in one specific instance because the same issues were being discussed
in a parallel proceeding and in the second specific instance because it was not found to
merit further examination but was reviewed independently by the NCP. One specific
instance was concluded without agreement due to delays and insufficient process.
A summary of all specific instances closed in 2016 can be found in Annex 2.

Agreement between parties
Agreement was reached between the parties in nine specific instances accounting for
60% of all concluded specific instances where mediation occurred (15 specific instances).
In one of these cases agreement between the parties was reached outside the specific
instance procedure shortly after the conclusion of the specific instance. This case was
handled by the Norwegian and Swedish NCPs and involved the construction of wind
turbines which could interfere with traditional migration routes of the Sami reindeerherding collective.66 Several months after undergoing mediation at the Norwegian NCP
an agreement was reached between the Sami collective and Statkraft, the enterprise
building the turbines, which set out the preventative measures which will be taken to
avoid the negative impacts to the traditional lands of the collective.
In some cases agreements reached among the parties included the development of a
remediation plan, or changes to a company's operations and policies to mitigate impacts
(see Box 2).
Box 2. Agreement reached through specific instance procedures
Starwood Hotels and IUF: In 2015 a specific instance was submitted to the US NCP by the
International Union of Food, Agricultural, Hotel, Restaurant, Catering, Tobacco and Allied
Workers' Associations (IUF) alleging that Starwood Hotels had not observed the Guidelines
with respect to discharge of workers and collective bargaining processes. Through mediation
organised by the US NCP the parties reached an agreement and fully resolved some of the issues
raised. The US NCP recommended that Starwood review their human rights policies and
supplier code of conduct to make reference to recommendations on RBC in line with the
Guidelines.67
Kinross and Paracatu Association: In 2016 the Brazilian NCP concluded a specific instance
brought by the Paracatu neighbourhood association claiming that the activities of Kinross had
caused damage to houses near the mine in Paracatu. Several mediation sessions were organised
by the NCP of Brazil after which the parties agreed that working with the local authorities,
Kinross would finance the renovation of damaged homes or resettlement where necessary. The
NCP also recommended that Kinross conduct due diligence processes that assess the effects of
its mining activities, and establish a maximum distance between its mining operations and
residential areas in Paracatu.

Improvements to company policy or operations
Nine (37%) specific instances reported as concluded in 2016 resulted in some
changes to company policy or operations to better meet the recommendations of the
Guidelines. These changes included strengthening corporate policies on human rights,
improving due diligence processes, as well as improving reporting processes and
transparency standards (see Box 3 for examples.)

Box 3. Changes to company policies through specific instance procedures
Etienne-Lacroix and Americans for Democracy & Human Rights in Bahrain (ADHRB): In
September 2016, ADHRB submitted a specific instance to the French NCP concerning the
export of security products to Bahrain by Alsetex, a French enterprise part of the Etienne
Lacroix Group. At the end of its examination, the NCP found that Alsetex had not committed
human rights violations in Bahrain. The NCP noted that Alsetex had put due diligence measures
in place in a bid to identify, prevent and mitigate the risks associated with its products, but that it
did not yet have a human rights policy, which is particularly important given its area of activity.
An agreement was reached that the company will take additional steps to protect against the reexport of its products to countries with poor human rights records (e.g. through including
punitive fines for countries that re-export Etienne-Lacroix products, as well as the termination of
all business relations where a country re-exports such products multiple times).
Rabobank and Friends of the Earth: In 2014 a specific instance was submitted to the Dutch
NCP alleging that Rabobank had not taken the appropriate steps to prevent or mitigate severe
environmental and social impacts related to a palm oil plantation which was managed by
Bumitama Agri Group (BGA), an entity partially funded by Rabobank. During the mediation
Rabobank agreed to address the consequences of non-compliance with the
requirement of free, prior and informed consent (FPIC) in the provisions of its palm oil
policy, to modify its current approach to handling complaints, and to publish its
complaints procedure, including a timeframe for the complaints procedure.

Role of investors
Several specific instances have demonstrated the important impact investors can have
on encouraging positive outcomes in specific instances (see Box 4 for examples).
Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI) and Aviva, one of the world's largest
investment service providers, are embarking on a joint initiative aimed at engaging with
companies that have been linked to adverse social and environmental impacts raised in
specific instances.
Box 4. Investor engagement and NCP Specific Instances
Mylan pharmaceutical and Individual: In 2015 a specific instance was submitted to the Dutch
NCP regarding Mylan, a pharmaceutical company, and human rights impacts associated with a
sale of their product used for lethal injections in US prisons. Since the specific instance was first
submitted Mylan has taken active steps to prevent rocuronium bromide from being used in US
prisons for executions. In its final statement for the specific instance the NCP noted that
“dialogue as well as disengagement by some [investors] appear to have contributed to
improvements in Mylan’s conduct.”
The American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO)
trade union took steps in 2016 to introduce a shareholder resolution at seven US companies
urging them to participate in mediation processes to remedy human rights violations including
through NCPs. Those targeted included companies that had declined to participate in mediation
offered by the US NCP at an earlier stage.

Interpreting the Guidelines: What is an MNE?
In 2016 several specific instances required tackling the complex issue of which
entities may be considered multinational enterprises for the purposes of the application of
the Guidelines. The Guidelines provide that “[a] precise definition of multinational

enterprises is not required for the purposes of the Guidelines.”68 In response to a request
for clarification on this issue by the Swiss NCP in 2005 the Chair of the Investment
Committee emphasised that these questions should be considered on a case-by-case basis
as flexibility is required when considering the application of Guidelines.69
In 2016, several NCPs considered the application of the Guidelines to an Export
Credit Agency, an international sports association, and an international non-profit
organisation. In analysing these relationships NCPs have looked at the nature of the entity
and its activities (see Box 5 for examples).
Box 5. What is an MNE under the Guidelines?
Atradius Dutch State Business (ADSB) and Both ENDS: In 2015 the Dutch NCP received a
submission alleging that ADSB, the official credit insurance agency of the Netherlands, had not
observed the Guidelines. The allegations related to the provision of export credit insurance on
behalf of and for the account of the Dutch State with respect to dredging projects in Brazil. In its
initial assessment, the NCP considered ADSB to be a multinational enterprise under the
Guidelines. ADSB and the Dutch Ministry of Finance responded by stating that they do not
consider ADSB to be a multinational enterprise under the Guidelines but agreed to engage in
mediation which resulted in agreement on some points between the parties.
World Wide Fund for Nature International (WWF) and Survival International: The Swiss
NCP received a submission from the NGO Survival International alleging that WWF had not
observed the Guidelines by failing to conduct due diligence and by not making its support for the
demarcation of protected areas conditional upon the free, prior and informed consent of the Baka
people of southeast Cameroon. In deciding whether WWF could be considered a multinational
for the purpose of the Guidelines the Swiss NCP noted in its initial assessment that the key
question should be whether an entity is involved in commercial activities, independently of its
2
legal form, its sector of activity or its purpose (profit or non-profit).
FIFA and Americans for Democracy and Human Rights in Bahrain (ADHRB): In 2016 the
Swiss NCP considered a submission by ADHRB alleging that FIFA had not observed the
Guidelines by allowing an individual to stand for candidacy in the FIFA presidential election
without first carrying out adequate due diligence regarding human rights. The NCP did not
accept the submission in part because the activities mentioned in the submission were not of a
commercial nature and therefore the NCP found that the Guidelines were not applicable to this
specific case. 3 In another specific instance concerning FIFA regarding working conditions, the
Swiss NCP accepted the case for further examination, noting that the relevant activities were of a
commercial nature and it is currently under review.

Type of companies involved in specific instances
The 38 specific instances which were closed in 2016 involved primarily large
enterprises (defined as companies employing over 250 employees).70 No small or
medium-sized private enterprises were involved in specific instances although two small
state-owned enterprises (SOE) were.
Companies subject to specific instances were mostly publically listed entities
representing 37% (14 specific instances) of all closed specific instances, followed closely
by privately held companies (29%) (11 specific instances). Three of the specific instances
involved SOEs and two involved other entities such as a sports association (FIFA) and
government agencies. Information on the identity of 21% of the companies (eight specific
instances) is unavailable as their names were kept confidential in final statements or final
statements have not been published yet (see Figure 2).

Final statements
The Procedural Guidance of the Guidelines provides that NCPs will "at the
conclusion of the [specific instance] procedures and after consultation with the parties
involved, make the results of procedures publically available […]"72
Final statements can be an important tool regardless of whether cases are accepted for
further examination as inclusion of recommendations and determinations can help
enterprises better understand the Guidelines and what steps they can take to better
observe them. Recommendations can be made by NCPs on the implementation of the
Guidelines. In particular if the parties fail to reach agreement or if the NCP finds that one
or more of the parties to the specific instance is unwilling to engage or to participate in
good faith the NCP will make recommendations as appropriate in the public statement.
Determinations can be made by NCPs to indicate that a company has not fulfilled the
recommendations of the Guidelines.

Final statements were published for 34 of the 38 (89%) cases that were closed in
2016. A final statement was published in 22 of the 24 (92%) cases that were concluded in
2016. Final statements were published for 12 of the 14 (86 %) specific instances not
accepted for further examination.
Of the 22 final statements published for concluded cases, 13 (59%) included
recommendations.73 Recommendations are especially useful in cases where parties have
not been able to engage or come to a resolution. Determinations of whether an enterprise
observed or did not observe the Guidelines were included in seven of the 22 final
statements (32%).74

Follow up
Following up on specific instances can be a valuable exercise in ensuring agreements
reached through specific instance proceedings are implemented and in tracking other
outcomes of specific instances proceedings. (See Box 6) In 2016, the NCPs of France, the
Netherlands, the United Kingdom and the United States conducted follow-up of specific
instances. In addition, the NCPs of Brazil, Denmark, Sweden and the United Kingdom
noted in their annual reports to the OECD that they planned to follow-up on certain
specific instances concluded in 2016.

Box 6. Follow up in specific instances
In 2013 the French NCP concluded a specific instance involving the Michelin Group after there
was a breakdown in dialogue amongst the parties and the submitting party withdrew their
participation. Despite this, the NCP published a statement with recommendations to Michelin
and committed to engaging in follow up. Since the end of 2013, Michelin has sent regular
updates to the NCP on the actions it has taken regarding the NCP's recommendations, and also
consulted with the NCP on certain matters. The NCP adopted an initial follow-up statement in
May 2014 reporting on the measures taken by the Michelin Group in response to
recommendations, notably the launch of the impact assessment studies and the actions taken to
strengthen dialogue with its stakeholders at the group’s level. The NCP released a final followup statement in February 2016 noting Michelin’s action and implementation of all
recommendations put forth by the NCP. In addition to having corrected the failings reported to
the NCP, the Michelin Group entirely overhauled its CSR approach, set up a suitable due
diligence system and made a solid commitment in respect of its supply chain for agricultural
commodities.

Specific instances not accepted for further examination
As noted above, 37% (14 submissions) were not accepted for further examination.
This rate is at the higher end of historical rates of non-acceptance which have been
between 25% and 40% since 200175 (see Figure 3).

The main reason for not accepting specific instances in 2016 was that consideration of
the issue would not contribute to the purpose and effectiveness of the Guidelines. This
reason was cited in 53% of not accepted specific instances. These included cases that
raised issues which were not covered by the Guidelines, where the issues dated back
several years, where the dispute was already adjudicated, or where a submitter was
seeking a specific type of remedy not available under the NCP mechanism. A lack of
materiality and substantiation was the second main reason for not accepting a specific
instance (see Figure 4).

Overview and trends of new specific instances in the reporting period
A total of 34 new specific instances were submitted to NCPs in 2016 compared to 52
reported in the last reporting cycle.76 The larger number of specific instances in the last
reporting period can be explained by the fact that it covered 18 months, instead of 12. The
34 new cases received in 2016 broadly aligns with general rates of submission since 2000
(see Figure 5).

Of the 34 new specific instances submitted, the following trends were noted:



Sector: The financial sector continues to be the most frequently cited sector for
specific instances for the second year in a row accounting for over 20% of all new
submissions.



Chapter: The chapter on human rights continues to be the most cited Guidelines
chapter in specific instances in line with historical trends. This year the chapter is
more prevalent than in previous years.



NCPs: This year saw several specific instance submissions to NCPs which have
previously had no, or few cases, including four cases submitted to the NCP of
Italy, two to the NCP of Colombia, two to the NCP of Morocco and one to the
NCP of Latvia (see Table 4).

At the end of 2016, the 34 specific instances submitted during this reporting period
covered all stages of the specific instance process: two had been concluded, five were
accepted for further examination after initial assessment, ten were not accepted for further
examination and 17 were still in progress and had not yet undergone initial assessment
(see Figure 6).
Nine specific instances submitted in 2016 are being handled with the help of
supporting NCPs. This is comparable to the last reporting cycle.

Specific instances by industry sectors
As noted above, in 2016 most specific instances related to financial and insurance
activities (seven cases) which accounted for about 20% of all specific instances
submitted. The financial sector is followed by manufacturing (five cases), mining and
quarrying (five cases), and construction (five cases) each representing about 15% of cases

Chapters of the Guidelines cited in specific instances
The chapter on human rights was the most frequently cited chapter in this reporting
period, referenced in 19 specific instances, representing 59% of all specific instances
submitted. This is an increase from the last reporting period where human rights was also
the leading theme referenced but accounted for 35% of the specific instances. The large
number of specific instances referencing the human rights chapter is consistent with
trends since the 2011 update of the Guidelines at which time the human rights chapter
was added.

Eleven specific instances submitted in 2016, raised issues around insufficient due
diligence processes. Stakeholder engagement practices were raised as an issue in three
specific instances during this time period. Six specific instances raised issues involving
inadequate remedy for impacts caused by an enterprise. As 17 specific instances
submitted during 2016 are still in progress and NCPs have yet to issue statements
regarding some of these, information on issues covered was not available for 13 specific
instances.

Host countries
13 of the specific instances submitted in 2016 address issues arising in non-adherent
countries and 13 address issues arising in adherent countries. Information on the
remaining eight specific instances is not available at this time as they are in progress.

Submitters of specific instances
As in previous years, NGOs have continued to be the primary users of the NCP
system. In the past reporting period their share of submissions was 29% (ten cases), lower
than historical trends where they have accounted for approximately 50% of all
submissions. Trade unions accounted for 26% of submissions (nine cases) and individuals
for eight cases. In this period two specific instances were submitted by multi-stakeholder
consortiums and one was submitted by a local community. One specific instance was
submitted by a company against state actors and was not accepted at the initial
assessment stage (see Figure 9).

Duration of procedures
For eight of the specific instances submitted in 2016, the time period for the initial
assessment lasted over six months. An additional nine specific instances had initial
assessment processes which lasted over three months. Together these account for half of
all specific instances submitted in this period.
There were 11 specific instances concluded in 2016 and submitted prior to 2016 for
which the NCP completed the initial assessment in over six months; in seven of these
cases the initial assessment was completed after 12 months.
The Procedural Guidance provides an indicative timeframe for the initial assessment
of three months.77 NCPs have identified completing specific instances in this time period
as a challenge. On the other hand, stakeholders have identified long initial assessment
periods as a shortcoming of the specific instance mechanism and have expressed that
completing this process sooner would make the system more impactful and effective.
With regards funding for specific instance activities, 31 NCPs reported having access
to funds for handling specific instances during the year.

Procedures for handling specific instances
By the end of 2016, 33 NCPs reported having rules of procedure for specific instances
available online. Of the 13 that do not have published rules of procedure 12 have not
closed a specific instance between 2011 and 2016, and one (Sweden) has (see Annex 3).

Confidentiality
Of the 33 NCPs with publically available rules of procedure, 30 have provisions on
confidentiality. Three do not have provisions on confidentiality.78 Six NCP rules of
procedure include a provision that if their confidentiality provisions are breached, the
specific instance procedures may be suspended.79 Beyond rules of procedure some NCPs
such as Norway, Denmark and the United States use mediation agreements for specific
instances which include confidentiality provisions. Such agreements establish the ground
rules and conduct the parties will be expected to follow during the mediation.

3. NATIONAL CONTACT POINTS

The relationship between confidentiality and campaigning was a subject explored in
detail during the November 2016 meeting of the National Contact Points. To support the
discussion a scoping paper on confidentiality and campaigning in specific instances was
developed by the OECD Secretariat.80 The paper will be revised based on inputs provided
by NCPs and other stakeholders and will seek to identify practical ways of promoting the
core criteria of transparency among NCPs while protecting confidentiality where required
in the context of specific instances.

Confirmation of receipt of specific instances
In 2016, 35 NCPs reported that they confirm receipt of specific instances
submissions. Generally confirmation of receipt is done through email. Some NCPs such
as Italy, France and Switzerland, include timelines for confirmation of receipt of specific
instances in their rules of procedure.

Collecting feedback
A total of 21 NCPs reported that they request feedback from parties to a specific
instance at the conclusion of the proceedings. NCPs did not specify the form that this
feedback generally takes (formal survey, written submission, informal debriefing, etc.).
Requesting and keeping a record of feedback from specific instances is valuable as
outcomes of a specific instance proceeding can be difficult to quantify and capture. For
example, specific instances can lead to stronger relationships and better engagement
amongst companies and key stakeholders. They can also lead to agreements after the
close of mediation by the NCP. Tracking and reporting party feedback, either at the close
of mediation or at a later date, can be a good way to capture some of these outcomes as
well as to learn where processes can be improved.

Mediation and dispute resolution
Eight NCPs reported using a professional mediator to help mediate specific instances
in 2016. Some NCPs such as Switzerland use external mediators regularly to handle
specific instances while others rely on NCP staff members to lead engagement. A total of
14 NCPs reported undergoing training on dispute resolution or problem solving in 2016.

NCP structure
As set out in the Commentary to the Procedural Guidance, NCPs should function in a
visible, accessible, transparent, and accountable manner. These are known as the core
criteria for functional equivalence between NCPs. The way in which NCPs are structured
is a matter for individual governments, provided the core criteria are met.

Location of NCPs and ministries involved
Most NCPs are located in ministries responsible for economic affairs, including trade
and investment. A total of 29 NCPs involve additional ministries in NCP activities, such
as ministries in charge of economic affairs, business, trade, innovation, commerce and
enterprises (24), foreign affairs (25), labour, employment and social affairs (23),
environment and agriculture (21) and justice (14).
Four NCPs are structured as independent agencies (Denmark, Lithuania, Netherlands
and Norway). An independent NCP is one whose members do not belong to a
government administration, although it will generally be supported by a Secretariat based

in a government administration. Five NCPs (Jordan, Morocco, Peru, Portugal and
Romania) are located in investment promotion agencies. Two NCPs (Poland and Slovak
Republic) relocated out of Investment promotion agencies and moved into ministries of
economy. More detail on location of NCPs and Ministries involved in NCP institutional
arrangements is presented in Annex 4.

Internal reporting and accountability
As part of the core criteria for functional equivalence, NCPs are required to be
accountable. One way to meet this requirement is through regular reporting to the
government. In 2016, 29 NCPs reported to their respective governments, of those 29
NCPs, 9 NCPs also reported to their parliament.

Meeting attendance and reporting to the OECD Investment Committee
41 NCPs attended the meetings of NCPs in both June and November 2016. A total of
5 NCPs did not attend the meetings of NCPs in either June or November. In 2015 a total
of four NCPs did not report to the OECD and in 2016, two NCPs did not report (Egypt
and Tunisia).

Stakeholders as part of the institutional arrangements
Stakeholders may be formally integrated into the institutional arrangements of the NCP,
meaning that they are either members of the NCP or present on advisory or oversight
bodies. A number of NCPs involve stakeholder representatives in their activities. In 2016,
25 NCPs reported having trade union representation, 26 NCPs integrated representatives of
the business community and 18 NCPs reported NGO representation.
Other collaboration with stakeholders may take place during stakeholder meetings,
organised by NCPs to convene with trade unions, NGOs and the business community that
are not part of the formal structure of the NCP. Over the course of 2016, 27 NCPs held
meetings with stakeholders.

Oversight and advisory bodies
The involvement of different ministries and of stakeholders in the NCP activity is in
some cases formalised through the establishment of advisory or oversight bodies.
Advisory bodies can be consulted by the NCP on a range of activities and issues on which
it provides advice, while oversight bodies have a monitoring role, for example on whether
the NCP has followed its own rules of procedures. Both advisory and oversight bodies
can include representatives from trade unions, NGOs, business and/or academia, along
with representatives of other government ministries or agencies. They do not normally
form part of the NCP and do not have decision-making power on accepting or concluding
specific instances. In 2016, 18 NCPs reported having an advisory body and 5 NCPs
reported having an oversight body. The roles and responsibilities of such bodies vary
between NCPs.

NCP resources
Adherents are required to provide human and financial resources to their NCP to ensure
it can meet its mandate of promoting the Guidelines and handling specific instances.
Nonetheless, lack of resources is often cited as a barrier by both NCPs and stakeholders.

Human resources
In 2016, 41 NCPs reported having either dedicated full-time or part-time staff, or
both. A total of 19 NCPs reported having dedicated full-time staff. A total of 32 NCPs
reported having part-time staff supporting the NCP. A total of 10 NCPs have both
dedicated full-time staff and dedicated part-time staff. Of NCPs that do not have
dedicated full-time staff, 22 reported having dedicated part-time staff and 3 NCPs81
reported having no dedicated staff. Table 5 provides a more detailed view on the staff
allocation of NCPs.
A total of 22 NCPs reported that a full-time or part-time employee joined the NCP
during the year (48%) and 18 NCPs reported having a full-time or part-time staff member
leave (39%). Three NCPs reported having one staff member leave during the year and no
new staff members join.

Financial resources
Table 6 shows more detailed information on the availability of financial resources for
NCP activity.
Almost all NCPs reported that they were able to access funds to attend the NCP
meetings at the OECD. Regarding promotional activities, 14 NCPs reported having a
specific budget while 22 NCPs reported having funds allocated on an ad hoc basis when
requested by the NCP. 65% of NCPs (30) reported having access to financial resources
for organising promotional events. A total of 30 NCPs had access to financial resources to
attend events organised by other NCPs, and 30 NCPs had means to join events organised
by other stakeholders.

In 2016, the OECD Secretariat initiated new research to examine the various
structures of NCPs. A total of 15 NCPs agreed to participate in the study and take part in
interviews. The report will be published in 2017.

Promotion of the Guidelines
Part of the NCP mandate is to promote the Guidelines and to handle enquiries. In
2016, a total of 113 promotional events were hosted by NCPs.82 A total of 17 NCPs83 did
not host any promotional events compared to 22 NCPs in the last reporting period.
NCPs organised different types of events, ranging from training, official meetings
with stakeholders, annual meetings, to larger conferences on topics such as due diligence
and responsible supply chains and those specific to different industries such as the
garment sector or mining.

The target audiences of the events organised and co-organised by NCPs include
business representatives (in 71 events), government representatives and institutes for
human rights (in 57 events), NGOs (in 56 events), trade unions (in 40 events), academic
institutions and universities (in 34 events) as well as the general public, journalists and
other NCPs.
In addition to organising events, 28 NCPs reported taking part in a total of 239 events
organised by others, during which they participated in presentations, panels and
discussions, contributing to promoting the Guidelines and the NCP. A total of 11 NCPs84
did not organise nor participate in any promotional events in 2016 compared to 15 NCPs
in the last reporting period. A detailed list of promotional events hosted by NCPs is
presented in Annex 5.
In addition to holding and contributing to promotional events, NCPs use a variety of
tools to promote the Guidelines. The Austrian NCP conducted a survey among the
business community to measure awareness of the Guidelines and the NCP. The Canadian
NCP supported responsible business initiatives in 31 Canadian missions in Latin America
and the Caribbean, Asia, Africa and Europe. Promotional events were organised by the
Chilean NCP on the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Meaningful Stakeholder
Engagement in the Extractive Sector and on the OECD-FAO Guidance for Responsible
Agricultural Supply Chains. At the initiative of the German NCP, the Guidelines were
featured in a press article in several newspapers explaining the role of the German NCP
and the German National Action Plan on Business and Human Rights.85
Improvements in the accessibility of information were seen in the translation into
local languages of the Guidelines (Slovenia) and of OECD sector guidance publications
(Chile and Poland).
A total of 25 NCPs reported having a promotional plan for 2017 setting out target
audiences for promotional activities over the coming year.
NCPs also featured at the GFRBC in June 2016 where a dedicated session focused on
NCP activities and drew attention to key findings in the report Implementing the OECD
Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises: The National Contact Points from 2000 to
2015. Several NCPs were active participants in the GFRBC.

NCP involvement in the Proactive Agenda
In 2016 NCPs supported various projects under the proactive agenda. The NCPs of
Canada, France, Italy and Sweden participated in the advisory group to the OECD project
on RBC in garment and footwear supply chains and fed into development of the OECD
Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains in the Garment and Footwear
Sector. The NCPs of Canada, Switzerland, the United Kingdom participated in the
advisory group to the OECD project on RBC in the financial sector and supported the
finalisation of the paper on Responsible Business Conduct for Institutional Investors. The
NCPs of Canada, Peru and Poland were active in promoting OECD recommendations on
stakeholder engagement in the extractive sector through organizing or participating in
events to promote the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Meaningful Stakeholder
Engagement in the Extractive Sector. The NCPs of Belgium and Germany both organized
events to promote the OECD-FAO Guidance for Responsible Agricultural Supply Chains.
Finally the NCPs of Belgium and Peru organized events to promote ongoing activities
under the OECD project on responsible mineral supply chains. (See Chapter 4 for more
detail).

3. NATIONAL CONTACT POINTS

Accessibility of information (NCP websites)
Although there is no specific requirement on NCPs to create a website, it can help
NCPs meet the core criteria of visibility and accessibility as websites generally serve as a
main source of information about the NCP and its activities. NCP websites also serve as
platforms for conveying information on the Guidelines, and explain the NCP’s role and
procedures. They can also be the main point of contact for raising enquiries and
submitting specific instances.
A total of 43 NCPs have a website which presents the text of the Guidelines,
information on the NCP and its mandate as well as an email address to reach the NCP
directly. Of these, 33 NCP websites include the NCP’s rules of procedures. A total of 33
websites present information on how to submit a specific instance and 28 present final
statements of specific instances issued by the NCP since 2011. 18 NCP websites present
information on upcoming events promoting the Guidelines. The detailed content of each
NCP website is presented in Annex 6. In 2016, four NCPs created a website (Costa Rica,
Greece, Luxembourg and Slovak Republic). Several NCPs revised their websites
(Colombia, Czech Republic, Finland, Ireland, Israel, Poland, Spain and Turkey).
Three NCPs do not have a website in place on the Guidelines or the NCP (Egypt,
Jordan and Tunisia).

NCP-hosted peer learning events
During the reporting period six NCP-hosted peer-learning events took place in Brazil,
Finland, Israel, Italy, Hungary and Poland. Each event was developed by the host NCP
with the support of the OECD Secretariat. They provided an opportunity for sharing good
practice between NCPs and on several occasions included an outreach component with
local representatives of institutional stakeholders and other international organisations,
civil society, etc.



On 16 February, the Brazilian NCP hosted a one-day peer learning meeting with
the Norwegian and United Kingdom NCPs, focusing on NCP processes.



The Israeli NCP hosted a peer learning event on 20-22 March in Jerusalem. 12
NCPs and the OECD Secretariat participated in a two-day capacity building
workshop also organised by the NCP of Israel. Participants shared experiences on
communication, promotion and handling of specific instances.



On 25 August, the Finnish NCP hosted a peer learning meeting for NCPs from
Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden.



The Italian NCP hosted a peer learning event for NCPs on 12-13 September
which brought together thirteen NCPs. The NCPs of Chile, France, Germany,
Norway, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States shared their
experiences during sessions on promotional activities, initial assessment and
follow-up activities.



On 6 October, as part of the event entitled “Responsible development –
responsible business conduct, 40 years of OECD Guidelines for Multinational
Enterprises, 20 years of Poland’s membership in the OECD”, the Polish NCP
held an NCP peer learning session focused on disclosure and reporting which
brought together seven NCPs.



The Hungarian NCP organised a peer learning workshop on 17-18 November, at
the occasion of the Second Budapest Conference on RBC and the OECD
Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises.

Action plan to strengthen NCPs
In 2016, the Investment Committee approved an OECD Action Plan to strengthen
NCPs.86 The Action Plan focuses on peer reviews and capacity building, peer learning
and the development of tools to support NCPs in delivering their mandate. A calendar of
peer reviews for 2016-18 was created. The peer review of the NCP of Belgium was
presented at the June meeting of the NCPs and a summary of recommendations is
included in Annex 7. In addition, the on-site visits for the reviews of Italy and
Switzerland took place in 2016. Capacity-building missions took place to Jordan and
Kazakhstan. Both missions focused on the development of an NCP and the role of RBC
in the respective countries. Furthermore, a tool developed by NCPs for NCPs to support
the creation of rules of procedure was shared and discussed at NCP meetings in 201687.
Canada, Italy, Germany and Switzerland provided voluntary contributions to support
activities under the action plan. Furthermore, in December 2016 the Council as parts of
its decision on the 2017-18 Programme of Work and Budget agreed to additional support
for work on NCPs through a long-term reallocation.88

4. DUE DILIGENCE TO IMPLEMENT THE GUIDELINES

Chapter 4
Due diligence to implement the Guidelines
Background
The OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises call on businesses to conduct due
diligence on their operations and throughout their supply chains to identify, prevent and
mitigate actual or potential adverse impacts in relation to matters covered by the
Guidelines (disclosure, human rights, employment and industrial relations, environment,
combatting bribery, bribe solicitation and extortion and consumer interests) and account
for how adverse impacts are addressed.
The expectation that businesses should carry out due diligence to address adverse
impacts has grown considerably over the last years. The 2015 G7 Leaders Declaration89
urged the private sector to engage in implementation of human rights due diligence in
their supply chains. It also pledged to help SMEs develop a common understanding of
due diligence and responsible supply chain management. Over the past two years
expectations of due diligence with regard to environmental and social impacts are
increasingly being incorporated in domestic legislation and policy (see also Chapter 2).
While due diligence is a crucial way for companies to demonstrate that they are doing
business responsibly, the Guidelines – which apply to enterprises operating across all
industry sectors - do not include detailed text on how due diligence should be carried out
in practice. Given that specific challenges may arise when implementing them in various
contexts and sectors, the OECD in 2009 began working on the sector-specific application
of the Guidelines, starting with a programme on responsible supply chains of minerals
from conflict-affected and high-risk areas. Recognising the success and effectiveness of
focused multi-stakeholder collaboration, during the 2011 update of the Guidelines,
Adherents called for the OECD to lead collaborative, demand-driven work with Members
and non-Members, business, workers and civil society to implement the Guidelines in
specific sectors or geographies.
Projects on (i) responsible mineral supply chains; (ii) stakeholder engagement in the
extractive sector; (iii) responsible agricultural supply chains; (iv) responsible garment and
footwear supply chains, and (v) RBC in the financial sector have contributed to
redefining risk across industry sectors and global supply chains. This work marks a shift
away from traditional commercial risk management to a more holistic approach that
addresses risks of business impacts on society and the environment, with a view to
promoting sustainable trade and investment. A new draft Due Diligence Guidance for
Responsible Business Conduct across sectors was a major addition to the sectoral due
diligence work in 2016. The draft Due Diligence Guidance draws from the body of work
in the sector projects, which provide more detailed recommendations tailored to the
specific risks in those sectors.

4. DUE DILIGENCE TO IMPLEMENT THE GUIDELINES

Highlights during the reporting period
1.

The main breakthroughs in 2016 include:



The Council adopted the Recommendation of the Council on the Due Diligence
Guidance for Meaningful Stakeholder Engagement in the Extractive Sector on 13
July 2016. Under the Recommendation, adherents are encouraged to take
measures to actively support the adoption of the due diligence framework for
meaningful stakeholder engagement.



On 13 July 2016, the Council also adopted the Recommendation of the Council
on the OECD-FAO Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from
Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas . The G7 Agricultural Ministers Meeting
Declaration of April 2016 welcomed the OECD-FAO Guidance for Responsible
Agricultural Supply Chains and encouraged companies to observe it.



The OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains in the
Garment and Footwear Sector was approved by the WPRBC on 24 November
2016 and the OECD Investment Committee on 14 January 2017.



The paper on Responsible business conduct for institutional investors, was
unanimously endorsed by the multi-stakeholder Advisory Group to the project on
Responsible Business Conduct in the Financial Sector in December 2016 and
agreed by the WPRBC in January 2017 and the Investment Committee in
February 2017.



The second revised draft of the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible
Business Conduct was released for public consultation in December 2016; it is
anticipated that the Guidance will be completed by the end of 2017.

Responsible mineral supply chains
Over the course of 2016 the OECD Secretariat has been engaged in a series of
projects to reinforce the implementation of the OECD Minerals Guidance and support the
expansion of its implementation into new minerals and geographies.
One of the central objectives of the OECD Minerals Guidance is to “help companies
contribute to sustainable development and source responsibly from conflict-affected and
high-risk areas, while creating the enabling conditions for constructive engagement with
suppliers.”90 By implementing the OECD recommendations on due diligence, companies
in the minerals supply chain can avoid contributing to conflict and help address serious
forms of human rights abuses. One project that is crucial for the integrity of the
implementation programme going forward is measuring due diligence implementation of
the OECD Minerals Guidance and results on the ground in conflict-affected and high-risk
areas.

Alignment Assessment of industry programmes with the OECD Minerals
Guidance
The OECD Minerals Guidance is used as the basis and benchmark by many industry
initiatives created to ensure the responsible sourcing of minerals. To gauge the alignment,
coherence and credibility of these initiatives - in particular at the smelter and refiner level
- the OECD has initiated an assessment of:
46

-----------------------Page 48 End-----------------------

4. DUE DILIGENCE TO IMPLEMENT THE GUIDELINES



The alignment of industry programmes’ standards and systems with the OECD
Minerals Guidance; and



The alignment of the industry programmes’ implementation efforts with the
OECD Minerals Guidance.

In mid-2016, the assessment tool and narrative methodology were published on the
OECD website.91 The initiatives being assessed during the 2016/2017 pilot phase are: the
Conflict Free Smelter Initiative (CFSI); the ITRI Tin Supply Chain Initiative (iTSCi); the
London Bullion Market Association (LBMA); the Responsible Jewellery Council (RJC);
and the Dubai Multi Commodities Centre (DMCC). The final report on the alignment of
the five programmes with the OECD Mineral Guidance is scheduled to be published
in 2017.

Supporting the implementation of the Guidance beyond gold, tin, tantalum and
tungsten
The Informal Ministerial Communiqué on Responsible Business Conduct of 26 June
2014 underscored “the relevance of the OECD Due Diligence Guidance to all mineral
supply chains” and called on “all stakeholders to broaden its application beyond the tin,
tantalum, tungsten and gold supply chains”, putting a specific emphasis on the coal
supply chain.92 To respond to this call by Members, the OECD Secretariat, with the
support of an informal expert group including representatives of private sector, civil
society organisations, and governments, and pursuant to the 2015/2016 work plan, has
launched a project that intends to help enterprises exercise due diligence in mineral
supply chains beyond tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold.
Recognising the difficulty of gathering the necessary information to initiate the due
diligence process, the OECD handbook on risks associated with production and trade of
natural resources intends to consolidate relevant information to help companies identify
the risks of non-financial adverse impacts (as detailed in Annex II of the OECD Minerals
Guidance) related to the production and trade of minerals and understand where they are
most prevalent. It ultimately seeks to help companies prioritise when exercising mineral
supply chain due diligence. The first version of this project will cover around 30 different
mineral supply chains and should be released by the end of 2017.

Cooperation with China on cobalt supply chains
The OECD is also actively engaged in the promotion of the OECD Minerals
Guidance in the cobalt supply chain. In April 2016, the Chinese Chamber of Commerce
for Metals, Minerals and Chemicals Importers and Exporters (CCCMC) and the OECD
organised a workshop on responsible cobalt, focusing on supply from the Democratic
Republic of Congo, the role of upstream and downstream companies and social risks in
the supply chain (notably the risk of the worst forms of child labour). As a result,
CCCMC and several multinational companies launched the Responsible Cobalt Initiative
in November 2016 to address risks in the mining and processing of cobalt, building on the
recommendations of the OECD Minerals Guidance and the Chinese Due Diligence
Guidelines for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals,93 adopted in December 2015, and
developed with the support of the OECD Secretariat.
In China, in addition to the programmes on cobalt, the OECD Secretariat participated
in the China Gold Congress and was involved in preliminary discussions with Chinese
authorities, in particular the Chinese General Administration for Quality, Supervision and

4. DUE DILIGENCE TO IMPLEMENT THE GUIDELINES

Inspections (AQSIQ) to discuss their ongoing efforts to standardise the OECD Minerals
Guidance and integrate it into Chinese national standards for imports of tin, tantalum and
tungsten (gold is planned to be included at a later stage).

Developing specific activities to tackle child labour risks in the minerals supply
chain
The OECD Minerals Guidance identifies the worst forms of child labour as a serious
human rights abuse associated with the extraction, transport or trade of minerals that
companies should not tolerate, profit from, contribute to, assist with or facilitate in the
course of doing business. Although the Guidance recommends that companies implement
a supply chain due diligence risk framework in order to respect human rights, there is
little detail available on how companies can conduct due diligence of the child labourrelated risks. In this context, the OECD Secretariat has developed Practical Actions for
companies to identify and address the worst forms of child labour in the minerals supply
chain.94 These Practical Actions, which are still in draft form and expected to be launched
in 2017, do not represent new or additional recommendations to the OECD Minerals
Guidance but explain in simple terms expectations already set out in the Guidance. The
Practical Actions have benefited from feedback from the ILO, UNICEF, civil society,
business practitioners and other expert stakeholders.

Connecting artisanal miners with international markets
One of the main areas of OECD's work in the responsible sourcing of minerals is to
ensure that international standards do not marginalise workers of the informal sector. For
the minerals sector, this means working on the formalisation of Artisanal and Small-Scale
Mining (ASM). The OECD Minerals Guidance includes an Appendix calling on
stakeholders to engage in legalisation and formalisation of artisanal mining. To further
uptake of the specific recommendations of this Appendix by the global private sector, the
OECD Secretariat released in 2016 a Frequently Asked Questions on ASM95 which
provides practical guidance and answers questions relating to the responsible sourcing of
gold from artisanal and small-scale miners.

Supporting the EU institutions on the Regulation on responsible supply chains
of minerals
The OECD Secretariat supports EU institutions by providing policy advice to ensure
maximum alignment of the draft European Regulation on responsible supply chains of
minerals with the OECD Minerals Guidance, on which the regulation is based. On 22
November 2016, the EU institutions reached an agreement on the final shape of the EU
Regulation.96 Brokered by the Commission, it will ensure sustainable sourcing for more
than 95% of all EU imports of tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold, which will be covered by
due diligence provisions as of 1 January 2021. The agreed framework carries clear
obligations for the ‘upstream’ part of the minerals supply chain, including smelters and
refiners, to source responsibly. The vast majority of metals and minerals imported into the
EU will be covered, while exempting small volume importers from these obligations. In
addition, the Commission will carry out a number of other measures - including the
development of reporting tools - to further boost supply chain due diligence by large and
smaller EU ‘downstream’ companies, i.e. those companies that use these metals and
minerals as components in goods.

Cooperation with Colombia
On 1-2 December 2016, the Government of Colombia and the OECD co-hosted a
regional workshop to exchange best practices around mineral supply chains in Latin
America. The workshop attracted 210 participants from Colombia and the region (mainly
Peru and Bolivia), embassy representatives from OECD Members, international
organisations, local and international businesses, artisanal miners, civil society and
indigenous representatives. The workshop demonstrated that the OECD work on
responsible mineral supply chains aligns well with Colombian President Santos’
priorities: peace, fiscal reform (including a focus on cracking down on informal economy
and formalising/ legalising activities, such as artisanal mining) and OECD accession.97

Engagement in West Africa
In West Africa, the OECD has initiated cooperation with the Liptako-Gourma
Authority, a regional organisation grouping Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger, to foster
transparency and RBC in regional gold trading networks. On 7-8 September 2016, the
Secretariat also participated in an event organised by the Dubai Multi Commodities
Centre in Accra, Ghana, to present the OECD Minerals Guidance to a West African
audience.

Meaningful stakeholder engagement in the extractive sector
The OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Meaningful Stakeholder Engagement in the
Extractive Sector provides guidance to mining, oil and gas enterprises in addressing
challenges related to stakeholder engagement. It offers extractive sector practitioners
practical tools and approaches for managing risks and responding to challenges with the
objective of promoting meaningful stakeholder engagement as an integral component of
due diligence.

Adoption of a Council Recommendation
This Guidance was approved by the OECD Investment Committee in December 2015
and launched in May 2015. On 13 July 2016 the Council adopted the Recommendation of
the Council on the Due Diligence Guidance for Meaningful Stakeholder Engagement in
the Extractive Sector was issued. The implementation of the Recommendation is subject
to regular monitoring by Council.
Under the Recommendation, adherents are encouraged to:



Take measures to actively support the adoption of the due diligence framework
for meaningful stakeholder engagement set out in the Guidance;



Ensure the widest possible dissemination of the Guidance and its active use by
enterprises conducting exploration, development, extraction, processing,
transport, and/or storage of oil, gas and minerals;



Promote the use of the Guidance as a resource for stakeholders such as affected
communities and civil society organisations;



Regularly report to the Investment Committee on any dissemination and
implementation activities.

4. DUE DILIGENCE TO IMPLEMENT THE GUIDELINES

Raising awareness and promoting meaningful stakeholder engagement
Two launch events were organised to celebrate the completion of the Guidance and
raise awareness of its recommendations and approach. The first launch event was
organised in Vancouver, Canada at the Canadian Institute on Mining Metallurgy and
Petroleum (CIM) annual conference (2 May 2016) and was attended by over 50
participants including CEOs of extractive enterprises. The second launch event took place
during the 10th Forum on Responsible Mineral Supply Chains in Paris (11 May 2016).
During both events leading industry representatives and governments presented and
strongly endorsed the Guidance.
In addition to these launch events, the Guidance was also promoted during events
organised in Lima, Bogota, and Warsaw, where a Polish version of the Guidance was
launched. The first technical training with respect to the recommendations in the
Guidance was organised in Lima and attended by a group of 20 participants. A workshop
co-organised with SOMO on Responsible business conduct in the context of fluctuating
metal prices in Paris also provided an opportunity to discuss the implementation of the
recommendations of the Guidance in challenging circumstances.
The Guidance is currently available in English, French, Spanish and Polish.

Responsible agricultural supply chains
The OECD together with the FAO developed the OECD-FAO Guidance for Responsible
Agriculture Supply Chains (OECD-FAO Guidance), which targets domestic and foreign,
private and public, small, medium and large-scale enterprises. It covers agricultural
upstream and downstream sectors from input supply to production, post-harvest handling,
processing, transportation, marketing, distribution and retailing.

Observing existing standards in responsible business conduct in the
Agricultural supply chain
The OECD-FAO Guidance was approved in February 2016 and launched in March
2016. The G7 Agricultural Ministers communiqué of April 2016 welcomed the OECDFAO Guidance and encouraged companies to observe the recommendations. On 13 July
2016 the Council adopted the Recommendation of the Council on the OECD-FAO
Guidance for Responsible Agriculture Supply Chains. The implementation of the
Recommendation is subject to regular monitoring by Council. Adherents are encouraged
to:

50



Promote the use of the OECD-FAO Guidance by enterprises operating in or from
their territories;



Take measures to support the adoption of the model enterprise policy and the
five-step framework for risk-based due diligence along agricultural supply chains
as set out in the OECD-FAO Guidance;



Ensure the widest possible dissemination of the OECD-FAO Guidance and its use
by various stakeholders;



Report to the Investment Committee and the Committee for Agriculture on these
activities.

Promoting the OECD-FAO Guidance
Since the launch of the OECD-FAO Guidance in March 2016, the OECD Secretariat
has participated in a number of conferences and events to raise awareness of the
Guidance with policy makers and promote its uptake by enterprises. The Guidance is now
available in English, French, German and Spanish and will be available in Chinese in
2017. A pilot implementation programme with enterprises will be launched in June 2017.
The pilot will aim to support enterprises in implementing the OECD-FAO Guidance and
should serve as a voluntary, collective learning exercise. It will allow participating
enterprises to learn by doing, proactively develop solutions to manage risks along
agricultural supply chains and put appropriate due diligence processes in place.

Responsible garment and footwear supply chains
The OECD project on Responsible Supply Chains in the Garment and Footwear
Sector aims to help companies implement the due diligence recommendations contained
in the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises along the full length of the
garment and footwear supply chain to avoid and address the potential negative impacts of
their activities and supply chains. This project focuses on all risks in the sector under the
OECD Guidelines, including those related to human rights, labour and employment, the
environment and bribery and corruption.

A common understanding of due diligence in the garment and footwear sector
The OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains in the Garment
and Footwear Sector (Guidance on Garments and Footwear) was approved by the
WPRBC on 24 November 2016 and the Investment Committee on 14 January 2017. This
Guidance seeks to establish a common understanding of due diligence in the garment and
footwear sector aligned with the Guidelines and is addressed to all companies. This
includes but is not limited to raw material and fibre producers, material manufacturers
and processors, components manufacturers, footwear and garment manufacturers, brands,
retailers and their intermediaries. It is relevant for SMEs and large companies alike. This
Guidance can also serve as a reference for sector-wide initiatives seeking to carry out
risk-based due diligence through collaboration. Observance of this Guidance is voluntary
and, as with all OECD due diligence guidance, is intended to help companies to source
responsibly from higher-risk countries.
This Guidance was developed through a multi-stakeholder process with in-depth
engagement from OECD Members and non-Members, representatives from business,
trade unions and civil society. A multi-stakeholder Advisory Group, chaired by Germany
and including representatives from the NCPs of Canada, France, Italy and Sweden, was
established in March 2015 to support the development of this Guidance. This Guidance
benefited from regular input of members of the Advisory Group and other experts,
including during a public consultation held in February-March 2016. It was unanimously
endorsed by the multi-stakeholder Advisory Group on 25 October 2016.
While the recommendations on this Guidance align with the Guidelines and build off
of other sector guidance, this Guidance does have unique features relevant to the garment
and footwear sector.



Modules on sector-risks: These modules provide information on how companies
can tailor their due diligence approach when addressing specific risks in the
sector. Modules cover the following topics: child labour, sexual harassment and

ANNUAL REPORT ON THE OECD GUIDELINES FOR MULTINATIONAL ENTERPRISES 2016 ©OECD 2017

51

-----------------------Page 53 End-----------------------

4. DUE DILIGENCE TO IMPLEMENT THE GUIDELINES

sexual and gender-based violence in the workplace, forced labour, working time,
occupational health and safety, trade unions and collective bargaining, wages,
hazardous chemicals, water consumption and pollution, greenhouse gas
emissions, bribery and corruption and the responsible sourcing from
homeworkers.



Factors that may affect the nature and extent of due diligence: This Guidance
seeks to reflect the diversity and reality of the sector and provides specific
recommendations on how companies can carry-out due diligence in light of their
size, sourcing practices and circumstances. This does not change the expectation
that companies apply due diligence, but it may affect how they implement it in
practice.



Collaboration: The Guidance recognises that many of the risks in the garment
and footwear sector cannot be adequately addressed bilaterally between a single
company and its suppliers. This is particularly the case with risks linked to
upstream sourcing (e.g. sourcing of cotton) but is likewise true for risks of harms,
such as forced labour, fire safety, electrical safety, etc. at manufacturing and
textile production. The Guidance therefore encourages the sector to take a sectorwide approach within particular regions to address risks. It also encourages
collaboration, where appropriate, in carrying out due diligence through multistakeholder initiatives, trade union partnerships, or at a sector-level.



Engagement with stakeholders: The Guidance provides explicit guidance on
when companies should engage with stakeholders, notably workers and trade
unions, during the due diligence process. Stakeholders should be involved—
meaning that they should actively participate in design and implementation—in
the following due diligence processes: on-site supplier assessments; development
of corrective action plans; verification, validation and monitoring of impacts; and
the design of operational-level grievance mechanisms.



Purchasing practices: The purchasing practices of retailers, brands and their
buying intermediaries have been demonstrated to contribute to harmful impacts—
such as excessive and forced overtime and low wages—in some cases. The
Guidance is the first international instrument that applies due diligence to a
company’s purchasing practices.

Actively supporting the dissemination and implementation of the Guidance
globally
In 2016 the OECD Guidance for Garments and Footwear has been promoted in
several countries.



52

On 6 December 2016 the OECD Secretariat organised a policy dialogue on due
diligence in the garment and footwear sector in Cambodia in collaboration with
the European Union and the Cambodian Ministry of Labour and Vocational
Training. Approximately 80 participants from government, business, trade unions
and civil society attended. The purpose of the meeting was to introduce the
OECD Guidance for Garments and Footwear in the sector and discuss its
practical application in Cambodia. The meeting included technical discussions on
sub-contracting, purchasing practices, and traceability. The OECD is continuing

4. DUE DILIGENCE TO IMPLEMENT THE GUIDELINES

its discussion with the Ministry in Cambodia to consider a pilot project
implementing the Guidance in Cambodia.



During the official visit of the OECD Secretary-General to New Delhi, India on
10-11 December 2016, the Secretary-General met with Minister of Commerce
Nirmala Sitharaman. The Secretary-General proposed a partnership to promote
responsible investment in India’s textile sector in the context of the ‘Make in
India’ initiative and embark on a partnership with the Indian Ministry of
Commerce to promote responsible investment in the textile sector in India, in-line
with the ‘Make in India’ objectives and the OECD Guidance for Garments and
Footwear. This partnership will seek to promote responsible investment in the
textile industry in India while also seeking to identify and address human rights
and labour abuses in the sector, notably in relation to freedom of movement and
forced labour. This proposed partnership will be part of the OECD platform to
implement the OECD Guidance for Garment and Footwear in 2017.

Alignment of sector standards with the OECD Guidance for Garments and
Footwear
The OECD Guidance for Garment and Footwear encourages collaboration between
industry actors and stakeholders as a means of implementing many aspects of due
diligence. While one such aspect is the assessment of suppliers, duplication of on-site
assessments creates a burden on suppliers without necessarily increasing the quality of
information collected. Supplier assessments should provide information that helps an
enterprise act - to prevent and mitigate harm in its supply chain - and should not take the
place of ongoing monitoring in collaboration with stakeholders. Within this context, the
OECD encourages the development of harmonised supplier assessments that lead to
recognition across the industry, provided they align with international standards including the Guidance for Garments and Footwear - and facilitate qualitative data
gleaned from engagement with workers alongside other indicators.
To promote the alignment of sector standards with the Guidance for Garments and
Footwear, the OECD is contributing to the Social & Labour Convergence project, an
industry initiative that seeks to develop a simple, unified and effective industry-wide
assessment framework for human rights and labour risks at garment and footwear
manufacturing sites. This is intended to result in a standardised diagnostic tool and
verification methodology for the industry to collect relevant assessment data, with the
ultimate intent to replace current proprietary tools. In order to allow adoption at scale, the
tool, verification methodology, and deliverables will be publicly available. The OECD is
contributing to this project by providing input on the strategic direction of the project and
by supporting its alignment with the OECD standards.

Responsible business conduct in the financial sector
The OECD project on Responsible Business Conduct in the Financial Sector aims to
support enterprises in the financial sector in implementing the Guidelines for different
types of financial service providers, building on their existing practices and reflecting the
practical realities, regulations and special characteristics of the sector. In 2016 the first
stage of this project was completed with the finalisation of a paper outlining due diligence
approaches for institutional investors.

4. DUE DILIGENCE TO IMPLEMENT THE GUIDELINES

Defining due diligence approaches for institutional investors
On 20 December 2016 the paper on Responsible business conduct for institutional
investors, was unanimously endorsed by the multi-stakeholder Advisory Group to the
project on Responsible Business Conduct in the Financial Sector. This group includes
representatives of leading global investment institutions as well as other financial service
providers, asset owners, government representatives, international organisations and civil
society groups.
This paper explains the application of the Guidelines in the context of institutional
investors and outlines key considerations for institutional investors in carrying out due
diligence. It represents a unique resource to investors seeking to comply with the
Guidelines and to apply RBC-driven due diligence approaches. Such a resource will be
particularly important as an increasing amount of specific instances are being handled
which relate to the responsibilities of investors in the context of their investment
portfolio.
The core of this paper describes the key components of due diligence and
considerations for investors to implement the Guidelines and carry out due diligence.
Each sub-section corresponds to a different step of the due diligence process or important
processes to support due diligence, and provides a list of examples of recommended
actions, adapted specifically to the context of investors. Each subsection also includes a
description of how actions may vary in practice across asset owners and managers and
across different investment classes and strategies. The paper also includes several
annexes to provide additional background on 1) distinctions in terminology used in the
Guidelines and in the context of institutional investment generally 2) common investment
value chains 3) different investment strategies and asset classes.

Leading an awareness raising and consultation process
The paper on institutional investors benefited from a broad consultation process. An
OECD Expert Working Session on Responsible Business Conduct and Investment was
organised on 23 October 2015 in London to discuss and collect feedback on the first draft
of this paper in which 43 experts participated. A second expert working session was
organised on 23 February 2016 in New York City to discuss and collect feedback on the
second draft of the paper in which 44 experts participated. A webinar was organised with
signatories to the Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI) on 24 March 2016 to
discuss the second draft of the paper which attracted over 80 participants. After each of
these consultation sessions the OECD Secretariat integrated feedback from participants
and experts into the draft.
In addition to managing to reach a common position on challenging issues in the final
paper this process was integral to educating leading institutional investors and other
financial service providers about the Guidelines and their importance and relevance to
institutional investment. The process was also impactful in educating civil society,
government representatives and NCPs about investment institutions and how they operate
in practice and how these characteristics may impact their due diligence processes.

New Guidance - a common approach to due diligence for all sectors
While due diligence is a crucial way for companies to demonstrate that they are
doing business responsibly, the Guidelines do not include detailed text on how due
diligence should be carried out in practice. To facilitate conformity with expectations of
54

4. DUE DILIGENCE TO IMPLEMENT THE GUIDELINES

due diligence under international standards, such as the Guidelines and UNGPs as well as
under new domestic obligations, the WPRBC agreed during its meeting on 8-9 December
2015 to develop a general guidance on risk-based due diligence for RBC, with the
following benefits:



A common approach to due diligence helps mainstream due diligence processes
across business operations and facilitate RBC among diverse commercial actors.



An international government-backed guidance for all sectors provides a common
reference point on due diligence for business subject to various domestic
obligations and international expectations and avoids a multiplication of different
expectations.



A common framework for due diligence makes the provisions of the OECD
Guidelines more accessible to businesses seeking to apply the principles of due
diligence across all of the relevant chapters of the OECD Guidelines.

Over the course of 2016, the OECD has worked with Adherents and institutional
stakeholders to develop the draft Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Business
Conduct. A first draft was released for comments from Adherents and institutional
stakeholders in May 2016, an in-person consultation meeting took place at the June 2016
GFRBC and a second revised draft was released for public consultation in December
2016. It is anticipated that the draft Guidance for all sectors will be completed by the end
of 2017 (see also Box 7).
Approaches articulated under the draft Due Diligence Guidance draw from the
various sector due diligence guidance, which provide more detailed recommendations
tailored to specific contexts. The draft Guidance however is not intended to replace or
modify existing sector-specific OECD guidance on RBC. Therefore where questions
arise, enterprises are expected to use the guidance that provides more specific relevance
to their operations or sector.
Box 7. Due diligence for responsible business conduct
Enterprises can create or be involved with:

•

Positive impacts on society and contribute to sustainable development, for example
through job creation, human capital development, raising investment and fostering
innovation.

•

Adverse impacts related to human rights, workers conditions, the environment,
bribery, disclosure and consumers through their own activities or their business
relationships.

Enterprises should maximise positive impacts and avoid adverse impacts. For this purpose, they
are expected to carry out due diligence.

WHAT IS DUE DILIGENCE?
The process through which enterprises can identify, prevent, mitigate and account for how they
address their actual and potential adverse impacts. Enterprises should carry out due diligence as
a way of meeting the recommendations of the Guidelines, building on existing systems that
underpin their management of risks. What may be new about this approach is orienting these
systems towards responsible business conduct:

•

Expanding or reorienting their due diligence process to focus not only on risks to the
enterprise, but also risks to the environment, to workers, to consumers, to people and
their human rights and of unethical conduct.

•

Identifying and managing not only risks associated with its own operations, but also
the risks the enterprise may create or be involved in through its web of business
relationships, for example through its supply chain.

CAPTURING THE “ESSENCE” OF DUE DILIGENCE

•

Covers the different risk areas mentioned in the Guidelines: Disclosure; Human
Rights; Workers and Industrial Relations; Environment; Bribery, bribe solicitations,
and extortion; Consumer Interests.

•

A risk-based approach, means that efforts should be proportional to risk; the potential
and actual severity of impacts are the driving force to scale up or down due diligence.

•

Prioritisation is crucial to identify the relative severity of RBC impacts and focus due
diligence efforts.

•

Systematic approach, involving on-going, proactive and reactive processes with a
focus on progressive improvement.

•

Nature and extent of due diligence varies according to company circumstances and
the situation, such as the size of the enterprise, its sector, operating environment or
market, business model, position in the supply chain, etc.

•

Stakeholder engagement is used to involve those potentially directly or indirectly
affected by its operations or business relationships.

•

Collaboration with enterprises at a sector-wide level, workers, home and host
governments, and civil society enhances due diligence.

•

Providing for or co-operating in remedy for adverse impacts the enterprise “caused or
contributed to” is an outcome of due diligence.

The draft Guidance is intended to help enterprises implement the Guidelines and meet
expectations of their stakeholders by taking a more integrated approach to doing business
responsibly. Enterprises will find familiar approaches contained in the Guidance, with
explanations of how they can be expanded to work towards eliminating adverse impacts.

SUMMARY OF “KEY ACTIONS” TO PUT A DUE DILIGENCE PROCESS IN
PLACE
I. Embed responsible business conduct into policy and management systems
1. Devise and adopt an RBC policy (or combinations of policies) that provide guidance to
staff and business partners and a clear signal to stakeholders and publish the RBC policy
(or policies) to support transparency.
2. Embed the RBC policy into its enterprise culture, approaches and management systems
to make sure it is rooted in the enterprise and is actually implemented as part of
everyday business.
3.

56

Assign accountability for RBC matters to senior management, and for public
companies, assign board level responsibilities; complement this by assigning
responsibility across relevant departments.

4. DUE DILIGENCE TO IMPLEMENT THE GUIDELINES

Box 7. Due diligence for responsible business conduct (cont.)
4. Develop management system(s) with internal controls that are commensurate with the
RBC risks of its operations and operating contexts to integrate RBC into its everyday
business processes.
5. Support implementation by providing adequate resources & training to staff, and as
appropriate, business partners.
6. Incorporate RBC expectations and policies into supplier or other business relationships,
including through contracts or other forms of written agreements with business partners.

II-A. Due diligence: Identify and assess adverse RBC impacts
1.

Use a variety of tools/approaches to scope out and identify risks of harm on all matters
covered by the Guidelines that may be likely to be in the enterprise’s own operations
and with its business relationships.

2.

Use iterative processes to prioritise and hone in on RBC risks and impacts, moving
from general areas of RBC risk to more specific RBC risks and impacts associated with
its activities and its business relationships.

3.

Assess whether those RBC risks or actual impacts would have the kind of adverse
impacts covered by the Guidelines, by benchmarking against relevant laws and
regulations and the Guidelines and assess the enterprise’s relationship to the adverse
impacts (i.e. cause, contribute or directly linked).

4.

Repeat these processes on a regular basis, recognising that more complex an enterprise
and/or the higher the RBC risks, the more in-depth these processes will need to be.

II-B. Due diligence: Prevent and mitigate adverse RBC impacts
1.

Design response plans that are fit for purpose for the potential or actual RBC impacts
and corresponds to the enterprise’s involvement with the impact.

2.

Prioritise responses as necessary, based on severity of the potential or actual impacts.

3.

Use leverage with business relationships to prompt responses to potential or actual
impacts.

II-C. Due diligence: Track performance
1.

Develop or adapt systems to track how it is responding to RBC risks & impacts and
monitor implementation of any management plan against established objectives, goals
and timelines.

2.

Seek to identify trends and patterns that highlight recurring problems and issues that
have been missed.

3.

Feedback lessons learned into improving due diligence and its outcomes in the future.

II-D. Due diligence: Communicate
1.

Disclose timely and accurate information on all material matters regarding their
activities, structure, financial situation, performance, ownership and governance as set
out in the Guidelines and the OECD Principles of Corporate Governance, if applicable.

2.

Disclose additional information set out in the Guidelines to improve understanding of
the enterprise’s operations.

3.

Communicate with stakeholders to account for how the enterprise has addressed actual
and potential adverse RBC impacts, adapting communication channels as necessary to
stakeholders.

III. Provide for or cooperate in remediation when appropriate

58

1.

Enable remediation for harms caused or contributed to, using a variety of avenues.

2.

Provide for or co-operate through legitimate processes in the remediation of adverse
human rights impacts where they identify that they have caused or contributed to these
impacts.

5. OUTREACH AND CO-OPERATION WITH PARTNERS

Chapter 5
Outreach and co-operation with partners
Promoting dialogue and deepening engagement on RBC with non-Adherents has been
one of the top priorities of Adherents since the Guidelines were updated in 2011. Cooperation is maintained with a number of key countries, either through regional, country,
or sector programmes. The GFRBC, established in 2013 with the purpose to strengthen
international dialogue on RBC and contribute to the effective implementation of the
Guidelines in a global context, has been a useful vehicle for advancing the global
conversation on current and emerging issues on RBC. Other avenues for dialogue are the
sector-specific forums and roundtables (e.g. minerals and textiles) discussed in Chapter 4.
In 2016, a focus on Asia was maintained and is expected to continue over the
medium-term. RBC is now systematically integrated in OECD investment policy reviews
(based on the Policy Framework for Investment), and the OECD institutional framework
for how RBC is considered in relation to adherence to the OECD Declaration on
International Investment and Multinational Enterprises and accession to the OECD was
strengthened.

Highlights
Deepening co-operation on responsible investment with partners in Asia
The Investment Committee has been doing investment policy reviews (IPRs)
since 1993. These demand-driven reviews are developed in close co-operation with
governments of the countries in question; close to 30 countries have been reviewed up to
date.98 IPRs look at the interaction of different investment-related policy areas from a
comprehensive and whole-of-government view in order to assess which reforms are
necessary for improving the business and investment environment. The reviews are based
on the Policy Framework for Investment (PFI), which was updated in 2015 through an
intensive multi-stakeholder process, bringing together the practice, experience and
lessons learned from a number of advanced, emerging and developing economies on what
makes up a good investment environment.
The update of the PFI also included strengthening the chapter on RBC policies, which
is of particular importance since it brings OECD investment instruments in alignment and
reflects the expectations on RBC set out in the Guidelines and the UN Guiding Principles
for Business and Human Rights. The chapter sets out the government's role in promoting
and enabling RBC. Although RBC had been included as a topic in some IPRs prior to
2015, notably in the 2014 Investment Policy Review of Myanmar, the strengthened RBC
chapter is a reflection of both the growing importance of the topic as related to
globalisation and trade and investment and the increasing interest from the countries
being reviewed to look at the impact of investment on sustainable and inclusive

5. OUTREACH AND CO-OPERATION WITH PARTNERS

development. The PFI reinforces the message that to the extent that governments provide
an enabling environment for businesses to act responsibly and meet their duty to protect
the public interest from potential adverse impacts of business activities, they are more
likely to keep and attract sustainable investment with responsible investors who minimise
the risks related to investments, and ensure broader value creation and sustainable
development.
A chapter on RBC has been integrated in three IPRs in 2016, namely those of Viet
Nam, Lao People’s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) and Cambodia.99 The chapters
describe initiatives on RBC; look at the elements of the policy framework that need to be
addressed in order to create an enabling environment for RBC, levelling the playing field
for responsible investors and protecting the public interest; and provide recommendations
on specific reforms that could be beneficial in order to create an enabling environment for
RBC. In addition to the already published reviews of Ukraine (2016) and Philippines
(2016), these chapters represent a new body of work applying the strengthened PFI
chapter on RBC in practice and building a new evidence base on RBC policies and the
government role on RBC.
A central part of the IPR process is peer learning and experience sharing. IPRs
generally involve several missions to the country, multiple meetings with relevant parts of
the government and stakeholders, an inclusive and iterative report writing process (which
includes wide stakeholder consultations), and visits from government officials to the
OECD.
Three consultation workshops on RBC and the Guidelines were organised in the
countries under review in 2016, in direct co-operation with authorities and relevant
stakeholders (Vientiane, Lao PDR on 6 April 2016; Hanoi, Viet Nam on 13 April 2016;
and Phnom Penh, Cambodia100 on 26 October 2016). These events were an opportunity to
discuss RBC with a wide range of government officials and raise awareness about RBC
with other groups, such as businesses, workers organisations and civil society.
In the case of Cambodia, the OECD also organised on 6 December 2016 an event on
due diligence in the garment and footwear sector to introduce the new OECD sector
guidance and discuss its practical application in Cambodia (see Chapter 4). This is a good
example of bringing together all the different facets of RBC work on a country-level.
Similar outreach activities also took place in Georgia. OECD and Georgia co-operate
on several different policy areas, with co-operation on RBC starting in 2013. The
Responsible Business Conduct in Georgia101 report was originally published in 2014 as
part of the work stream under the Guidelines. In 2015, the government of Georgia
requested an update of the publication in order to reflect the latest policy developments
on RBC that were implemented in response to the 2014 publication. The OECD and the
Ministry of Economy and Sustainable Development organised a multi-stakeholder
workshop on 27 May 2016 on Promoting Responsible Business Conduct in Georgia,
hosted by the Deputy Minister of Economy and Sustainable Development, in order to
consult on the 2016 update of the publication and raise awareness about RBC among
different government ministries and stakeholders. Further co-operation with Georgia on
investment and RBC is envisioned.
Co-operation with China continued deepening, in particular as related to the
implementation of the Chinese Due Diligence Guidelines for Responsible Minerals
Supply Chains, which were set out in 2015 on the basis of the OECD Due Diligence
Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High60

Risk Areas (Chapter 4). The OECD Secretariat hosted a secondee from the Chinese
Academy of International Trade and Economic Co-operation, nominated by the
government in order to share experience on RBC and learn more about the NCP system.

Supporting new Adherents to the Investment Declaration
Since 2015 particular emphasis has been placed on assisting candidate countries in
line to be reviewed for adherence to the Declaration on International Investment and
Multinational Enterprises (Declaration) to understand the full extent of their
commitments on RBC as new Adherents. For example, importance has been given to
ensure that new Adherents fully understand both the importance of an enabling policy
framework for RBC, as well as the obligations related to implementing the Guidelines
and setting up a fully functioning NCP that meets the core criteria set out in the Decision
on the Guidelines. To that effect, the review of Ukraine in 2015 included an experience
sharing component, such as the workshop with the Ukrainian government on RBC and
NCPs102 and preparation of resource documents for the authorities. It also included a
dedicated chapter on RBC in the review report itself, and RBC and the role of the NCP
were discussed in a dedicated session during the in-person review with the Investment
Committee.
This practice continued in 2016 with the adherence review of Kazakhstan. The
OECD and the Ministry of Investments and Development (MID) organised a joint
conference103 on 29 June 2016, chaired by the Vice Minister, to share information with
the Kazakh authorities and relevant stakeholders about RBC, the Guidelines, and the NCP
mandate, structure, and core criteria, as well as how NCPs resolve issues in practice.
Around 50 participants attended the workshop, representing different parts of MID, but
also Ministries of Foreign Affairs, National Economy, Energy, Finance and
representatives of all stakeholder groups. Representatives of MID and the Ministry of
National Economy also attended the 2016 GFRBC and the Meeting of the National
Contact Points on 7-10 June 2016.
Furthermore, in order to streamline the inclusion of RBC and NCP issues in the
reviews by the Investment Committee – either for adherence to the Declaration or for
accession to the OECD – the Investment Committee formalised the role of the WPRBC in
2016 in the process. The decision to do so was taken as one of the responses to the
demands by Adherent governments and stakeholders to improve NCP functioning and
functional equivalence and in recognition of the fact that demands on NCPs are likely to
increase in the future considering their unique contribution to improving access to remedy
globally. In addition to a dedicated chapter in the review report, at least one capacitybuilding event will be organised in-country during the review process for adherence. The
WPRBC will also be providing its technical opinion to the Investment Committee, which
may include recommendations for specific actions that the candidate country could be
invited to take in light of the findings. These new procedures will apply to any new
accession reviews as well as the ongoing ones of Costa Rica and Lithuania, and any new
adherents as of 2017.

Widening adherence to the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises
The 2015 Ministerial Council Statement included a reaffirmation by Ministers of the
importance of the OECD Declaration on International Investment and of non-Members
adhering to it, encouraging wider adherence to the MNE Guidelines, and inviting the
OECD to study options in that regard. In response to this mandate throughout 2016 the

5. OUTREACH AND CO-OPERATION WITH PARTNERS

OECD engaged in analysis and discussion of options to encourage additional adherence
to the Guidelines including through increased outreach. These discussions are currently
ongoing at the level of the Investment Committee with a view to identifying workable
and effective approaches.

Continuing partnership and co-operation
The focus on Asia as priority for outreach will continue over the next three years,
under a joint EU-OECD-ILO programme on responsible supply chains in Asia. In close
co-operation with target country authorities and the ILO, the OECD will be working with
five countries – namely China, Thailand, Viet Nam, Philippines, and Myanmar – and one
Adherent – Japan – to promote RBC and responsible supply chains. Funded by the EU,
this project will focus on labour rights, human rights, and environment and will include
joint action in four areas, namely research, capacity building, outreach and events, and
policy support. Additionally, it will allow for sharing of experiences on the ground as
related to the Guidelines, particularly considering that Japan is an Adherent country and
has extensive ties and business networks in most countries concerned. The EU-OECDILO project is scheduled to be launched in the second half of 2017.

Fourth Global Forum on Responsible Business Conduct
The GFRBC was launched in 2013 to strengthen international dialogue on RBC and
to enhance the synergies between corporate responsibility instruments on all levels,
including the Guidelines. The 2016 GFRBC, held on 8-9 June at the OECD in Paris,
brought together over 750 participants from governments, businesses, trade unions, and
civil society. The main themes of 2016 included: achieving actual impacts through better
business practices, emerging issues in supply chains, and promoting a better contribution
of the private sector to the achievement of SDGs. This chapter includes the highlights of
the discussions: more details are available in the 2016 GFRBC Summary Report.104
Building on the success of the policy session on National Action Plans organised
together with the UN Working Group on Business and Human Rights in 2015, the 2016
GFRBC also included, for the first time, a High-Level Roundtable for Policy-Makers held
on 7 June 2016. The Roundtable was attended by around 130 policy-makers who
discussed challenges related to the design and effective implementation of RBC policies,
such as the lack of political support, insufficient capacity and resources to design and
implement RBC policies, concerns that RBC policies may affect competitiveness, lack of
policy coherence, and others. The Roundtable provided a space for dialogue among
policy-makers from Guidelines Adhering and non-Adhering countries and allowed
participants to exchange experience and discuss ways to effectively design, promote and
implement policies and instruments to promote RBC.
The following key messages emerged from the GFRBC 2016:



62

A wide range of innovative actions on RBC, from policies aimed at addressing
impacts throughout supply chains, voluntary agreements between governments
and businesses to enhanced disclosure requirements and new engagement models
that financial institutions and financial service providers are implementing in
order to promote RBC among their clients, are evidence that RBC is increasingly
relevant and is shaping the way business is done. This is good news. Additionally,
the latest empirical evidence on the impact of RBC on business performance,
such as improved financial returns, increased access to credit, employee retention,
ANNUAL REPORT ON THE OECD GUIDELINES FOR MULTINATIONAL ENTERPRISES 2016 ©OECD 2017

5. OUTREACH AND CO-OPERATION WITH PARTNERS

and the costs of implementing due diligence and other RBC actions, is
encouraging. Whether RBC criteria should be considered in measuring business
performance is not a debate any longer, the question is rather how.



However, much remains to be done. The cases related to human trafficking and
modern slavery in global supply chains (e.g. on fishing boats, cocoa plantations,
and cotton farms) that came to light in 2016 are a stark reminder of this fact.
Responsibility follows impact and businesses need to accept responsibility for
impact wherever it happens in their supply chain. Systemic solutions are needed
for systemic problems and require collective action. Businesses cannot address
issues like slavery alone.



Policy action, accountability mechanisms such as the one provided by NCPs, and
better and clearer data both at firm and country level can help scale up action on
RBC. Transparency is needed from governments as much as it is from business.
Relevant tax-related information needs to be shared and made accessible.
Additionally, there is a need to establish a level-playing field between
governments. This can be established through a global agenda. It is important for
businesses to have standardised rules and confidence in the viability of the tax
system.



Many governments are leading by example. They can act as honest brokers to
bring groups together, help launch multi-stakeholder initiatives, and push for
international co-operation. It is important to ensure that those directly affected by
adverse impacts in the global supply chains (particularly underrepresented voices
from women, young people and indigenous peoples) have a seat at the table.



Over the past 15 years, NCPs have shown their potential and provided results.
Stakeholders voiced support for the NCP system and recognise it is in the interest
of all for the mechanism to be fully functioning. Adequate resources and support
from their governments are critical for NCPs to be able to fully function and meet
their mandate. Governments should make NCPs a priority and increase the
resources available to them.

Cooperation with other organisations
In addition to engagement with international organisations and partner countries,
described above, OECD work on RBC also included cooperation with multi-stakeholder
initiatives, such as the Mega-Sporting Events Platform for Human Rights (MSE
Platform), a coalition of international and intergovernmental organisations, governments,
sports governing bodies, athletes, unions, sponsors, broadcasters, and civil society groups.
This cooperation included participation in the production of several papers on various
aspects of human rights protection in the context of mega-sporting events, such as access
to remedy and due diligence. This work, which is ongoing, helped to highlight the NCP
system as one key mechanism for access to remedy, and to show the relevance of OECD
sector due diligence guidance to e.g. sponsors of sports events.105 The 2016 Global Forum
on Responsible Business Conduct also included a special session on human rights and
labour issues in mega-sporting events. This work forms part of broader work by OECD
on sports, corruption and responsible business conduct.106

6. MEASURING THE IMPACT OF RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS CONDUCT

Chapter 6
Measuring the impact of responsible business conduct
Following demand from delegates and stakeholders for more evidence on the impacts
of RBC two projects were launched in 2016. The first project in collaboration with the
School of International and Public Affairs at Columbia University developed a
framework to measure the costs and benefits of due diligence for businesses. The second
project, which is still on going, aims to arrive at a core set of indicators which
stakeholders in the minerals supply chain can agree on to track due diligence efforts and
results on the ground. Other efforts to promote understanding of measuring the impact of
responsible business conduct included a session on Measuring links between business
performance and responsible business conduct at the 2016 GFRBC, and the collection of
evidence on the impacts of RBC on companies' performance included in the chapter on
Promoting sustainable development through responsible business conduct in the 2016
OECD Development Co-operation report.
There is increasing evidence that acting responsibly is not just a matter of compliance
but also has a win-win outcome: that sustainable supply chains and better financial
performance can go hand in hand and that one can drive the other. A meta study
conducted by Deutsche Asset Management and the University of Hamburg found that
roughly 90% of studies looked at (2200 individual studies) find a nonnegative correlation
between ESG and corporate financial performance. More importantly, the large majority
of studies reports positive findings.107 The positive ESG impact on corporate financial
performance appears stable over time.108 Likewise, a Harvard Business School study
which tracked the performance of companies over 18 years, found that “high
sustainability” companies, those with strong environmental, social and governance (ESG)
systems and practices in place, outperformed “low sustainability” companies as measured
by stock performance and in real accounting terms.109 A 2016 study covering 8500
French enterprises noted there was a 13% difference in economic performance on average
between enterprises that implemented responsible business conduct and those that did
not. Businesses that work towards sustainable supply chains and put responsible practices
in place thus seem to reconcile responsible management (towards clients, suppliers, and
employees), respect for the environment and the requirement for competitiveness.110

Efforts to measure the costs and benefits of due diligence
Project with the School of International and Public Affairs at Columbia
University
In 2016 the OECD Secretariat collaborated with the School of International and
Public Affairs (SIPA) at Columbia University to develop a framework to quantify the
potential costs and benefits of risk-based due diligence for responsible business conduct.
The project used the framework on due diligence as recommended by the OECD sector

NOTES

guidance. In the first phase, the SIPA team was tasked to carry out a literature review on
the cost and benefits of applying RBC and due diligence in particular. Based on the
results of the literature review, the team then attempted to develop a taxonomy and
methodology to help assess the costs and benefits of applying due diligence in alignment
with the due diligence framework proposed by the Guidelines. The framework was used
to develop a draft survey that could be used to collect data on the costs and benefits of
due diligence from companies.
This exercise showed that while costs can be fairly accurately apportioned to duediligence and RBC activities in general, it is difficult to quantify the benefits of these
activities. This is mainly due to the fact that it is challenging to establish one-to-one links
between a specific RBC activity and a specific benefit or outcome. RBC activities tend to
create multiple intermediate benefits, which are influenced or reinforced by other RBC
measures. Isolating the effect of one activity from the other or the whole is extremely
difficult. This challenge is heightened by the extremely heterogeneous nature of
companies in terms of markets, organisational structure, and business models.
There is a possibility (contingent on resources and demand) to use the draft survey
developed by SIPA students to test the effectiveness of the proposed methodology with a
small group of companies. The idea is to ensure that the methodology is robust, and the
survey can be utilised to collect data that can be analysed in a meaningful manner. Based
on this data, the framework methodology could be used to build an empirical basis to
inform further RBC standards and tools. The cost and benefit findings could also be used
for outreach and engagement with industry and new markets.

Measuring results of mineral supply chain due diligence in conflict-affected
and high-risk areas
The OECD embarked on a project to measure due diligence implementation of the
Minerals Guidance and results on the ground in conflict-affected and high-risk areas. One
of the central objectives of the Minerals Guidance is to “help companies contribute to
sustainable development and source responsibly from conflict-affected and high-risk
areas, while creating the enabling conditions for constructive engagement with
suppliers.”111 By implementing the OECD recommendations on due diligence, companies
in the minerals supply chain can avoid contributing to conflict and help address serious
forms of human rights abuses as defined in Annex II of the Minerals Guidance.
The Secretariat convened an informal working group on the margins of the 2016
OECD Forum on Responsible Mineral Supply Chains to discuss a framework and
possible indicators for measurement of results on due diligence of minerals supply chains
and the results on the ground in conflict-affected and high-risk areas. The informal
working group is drawn from the over 500 members of the OECD implementation
programme. Members of the group include government policy makers, business
implementers, civil society as well as measurement experts from OECD, World Bank,
EU, academia and development consultancies. The goal of the group is to streamline and
align data collection to a common set of metrics which can be collected over a number of
years by various organisations and entities. By having an agreed set of metrics, the OECD
aims to ultimately draw on data from existing stakeholders to analyse data patterns. There
will likely be a need to commission new data for areas where gaps exist or the quality and
compatibility of the data is poor.

6. MEASURING THE IMPACT OF RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS CONDUCT

Measuring links between business performance and responsible business
conduct
During the session Measuring links between business performance and responsible
business conduct held at the 2016 GFRBC, panellists discussed the increasing body of
evidence demonstrating the positive impacts of responsible business practices. Challenges
such as measuring impacts beyond financial indicators, monitoring intermediary impacts
on productivity, and understanding and accurately characterising externalities and tail
risks were also discussed.
Some of the takeaways of the session were that the business benefits of RBC are
increasingly recognised and the question is no longer about whether there is a positive
correlation between business performance and RBC but rather what are its drivers and
how can it be better measured. Panellists concluded that more thinking needs to be
invested into how to reflect intangible impacts, such as the quality of relationships
between business and local communities, in measuring the impact of responsible business
conduct. It was also noted that it is important to develop a smart mix of regulatory and
non-regulatory incentives for RBC. While there is some evidence that regulatory
approaches can promote RBC there is also evidence that when more discretion is given to
firms on how they meet policy objectives, these actions will be taken at a higher level of
an enterprise and be more integrated.

According to K. Tapiola (General Secretary of TUAC from 1978-1985 and
Chairperson of the TUAC Working Group on MNEs and Globalization until 1996),
evidence that multinational enterprises were involved in destabilising the
democratically elected government of Chile brought international attention to the
activities of multinational enterprises (OECD ILA SFDI Roundtable on 40 years of
the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises).

The case concerns an American company which refused to pay compensation to the
250 employees dismissed by its Belgian subsidiary upon bankruptcy. Following a
submission by TUAC and the Belgian Government, the Investment Committee
clarified that - without invoking the particulars of the case –“observance of the
Guidelines should, in some instances, lead parents companies to assume certain
financial obligations of their subsidiaries’ and considered these obligations as ‘good
management practice’. See: Report by the Committee on International Investment and
Multinational Enterprises on the Review of the 1976 Declaration and Decisions on

A paper developed by the OECD Secretariat in preparation for the 2014 informal
ministerial meeting on RBC found that more than three quarters of recently concluded
international investment agreements (IIAs) (i.e. between 2008 and 2013) contain
language on sustainable development or RBC and virtually all of the investment
treaties concluded in 2012 and 2013 include such language. Out of the 54 countries
covered by the survey, 47 have included some language on sustainable development
or RBC in at least one of their treaties. Kathryn Gordon (2014), Investment treaty

On 17 March 2011, the NGO Asociación Civil por la Igualdad y la Justicia (ACIJ) submitted a specific instance alleging that Ferrostaal Argentina S.A., controlled by the MAN Ferrostaal AG Group,
headquartered in Germany, did not observe the Guidelines. More specifically, it was claimed that criminal activity had been carried out by executives of the company, who allegedly bribed members of the
Argentinian military, public officers and lawyers, in order to secure the award of a contract for the design of sea patrol vessels.
In‌May‌2011,‌following‌an‌analysis‌of‌ACIJ’s‌argument‌and‌the‌documents‌submitted‌the‌NCP‌accepted‌the‌submission‌for‌further examination, considering that, prima facie, it complied with the formal
requirements set forth in the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises. In this context, the NCP offered its good offices to the parties to facilitate the dialogue process, in order for them to reach an
agreement.
The NCP invited the parties together in order to foster dialogue between them, however no agreement was reached.
Based on the above and the lack of progress in the steps taken for the two parties to sit at a dialogue table, the NCP considers that it cannot continue to effectively implement its role of facilitator. On 11
November 2016, the NCP published its final statement concluding the specific instance.

On 4 July 2011, the Argentinian NCP received a submission by the NGO Asociación Civil por la Igualdad y la Justicia (ACIJ) alleging that BNP PARIBAS, a French multinational enterprise, did not
observe the Guidelines in Argentina.
The previous NCP office failed to analyse the filling by ACIJ in a timely manner. Thus, this submission was not examined before the restructuring of the Argentinian NCP. On 2 November 2016, in the
context of the work to improve the Argentinian NCP, its new members made a formal offer to the NGO to update its request‌in‌order‌to‌adequately‌consider‌the‌specific‌instance.‌The‌NCP’s‌offer‌did‌not‌
lead a result. The NCP thus dismissed the claims and closed the specific instance on 15 December 2016.

In March 2016, the NCP received a submission regarding the activities of the company Lafarge Holcim Ltd. The specific instance was submitted by Ricardo José Manuel Molina, an electromechanical
engineer and former employee of Lafarge Holcim and inventor of a machine used by the company. The submission alleged that the company did not provide Ricardo Molina with the appropriate benefits
of his invention.
In May 2016, following an analysis of the documentation, the NCP accepted the specific instance for further‌examination‌and‌offered‌its‌good‌offices.‌Following‌the‌NCP’s‌offer,‌the‌company‌requested‌
that the specific instance be terminated. The NCP engaged in a dialogue with the company to clarify the NCP process. On 31 October 2016, the company submitted new documentation explaining that it
was not able to take part in the mediation because of existing parallel judicial proceedings.
Following‌the‌company’s‌submission,‌the‌NCP‌proposed,‌via‌a‌meeting‌with‌the‌company‌and‌via‌a‌phone‌call‌with‌the‌submitters, that the parties:
- discuss a solution in relation to the amount of compensation requested by Mr. Molina;
- not resubmit any proposals which had already been made before (i.e., in the parallel mediation process that had already ended) but instead, explore new means to improve the other elements discussed
thus far.
The‌parties‌accepted‌the‌NCP’s‌proposal;‌however,‌the‌goal‌was‌not‌achieved,‌and‌they‌failed‌to‌reach‌an‌agreement.‌On‌15‌December 2016, the NCP issued a final statement concluding the specific
instance.
The NCP encourages the parties to consider finding a way to generate the conditions required to engage in dialogue and constructively work for the resolution of the issues in which they are involved.

On 9 October 2015, Mr Karembé Boulkassoum, on behalf of the National Federation of Mining and Energy (FENAME) of Mali, submitted a specific instance to the Australian NCP alleging nonobservance of the Guidelines by Bayswater Contracting and Mining Group (BCM).
More specifically, FENAME alleged that BCM, at their operating site in Loulo, Mali, dismissed 436 workers including 26 union representatives without correct approval from the relevant local Government
agency - the Mali Directorate of Labour.
The NCP conducted an initial investigation and determined that BCM is not a registered Australian enterprise. Attempts to contact BCM were made but not answered.
Under the OECD Guidelines, the NCP is required to refer a specific instance to another relevant NCP if the enterprise is not based in Australia. However at the time of the investigation, there appears to
be no other NCP with operational jurisdiction.
As BCM is not an Australian multinational enterprise, the NCP closed this specific instance, issued a final statement in December 2016 and notified FENAME of its decision.

On 23 May 2016, M. Edouard Teumagnie (an individual from Cameroun) submitted a specific instance to the NCP of Belgium regarding the activities of the Belgian enterprise Brussels Airlines.
M. Teumagnie stated that Brussels Airlines did not observe the Guidelines during his boarding process at the Douala airport in Cameroun on 17 April 2016. He claims that the company made him pay a
penalty fee and made him change the date of his return ticket for exceeding the 90 days stay limit within the Schengen area. He argues that Brussels Airlines staff was rude to him.
Both Brussels Airlines and M. Teumagnie provided additional information to the Belgian NCP. On 4 August 2016, the Belgian NCP met with a representative of Brussels Airlines and received more
information about the company and its operations in Cameroun. The representative of the company agreed to apologise for the late answer to the consumer complaint of M. Teumagnie.
On 31 August 2016, the Belgian NCP published its initial assessment closing the specific instance as Brussels Airlines replied to M. Teumagnie on 10 August 2016, answering his questions. The NCP
played its role as a facilitator. The NCP recommends that Brussels Airlines improve their process to respond faster to customer complaints and that the company implement due diligence practices.

On‌18‌June‌2013,‌the‌Brazilian‌NCP‌received‌a‌submission‌from‌the‌city‌of‌Paracatu’s‌neighbouring‌associations‌alleging‌that‌Kinross Brasil Mineração, part of the Canadian multinational enterprise
“Kinross‌Gold‌Corporation‌Group”,‌did‌not‌observe‌the‌Guidelines.
More specifically, the submitters alleged that the use of explosives by Kinross damaged surrounding homes and that some of the infrastructure built by Kinross made access from the rural area of
Machadinho to the city of Paracatu difficult.
In August 2013, the NCP accepted the submission for further examination and offered its good offices which were accepted by both parties. Three mediation meetings took place between September
2015 and September 2016, and the parties reached an agreement.
Although‌no‌link‌was‌established‌between‌the‌company’s‌use‌of‌explosives‌and‌the‌damage‌to‌homes,‌Kinross‌stated‌its‌intent‌to repair the homes in three urban neighbourhoods through a partnership
project with the City of Paracatu and the active participation of the community.
On 22 September 2016, the NCP concluded the specific instance and a final statement was released on 21 December 2016. The NCP recommends that Kinross:
Meet its commitment to support the community of Machadinho‌in‌providing‌guidance‌on‌how‌to‌apply‌the‌company’s‌program‌in‌Paracatu;
Inform residents from neighbouring areas of their work and future projects to build a relationship of trust;
Conduct due diligence processes that assess the adverse impacts of its mining activities.
In addition, the NCP requests to remain informed of the partnership project between Kinross and the City of Paracatu.

On 4 December 2013, the Brazilian NCP received a submission from a German parliamentarian, regarding the activities of C&A Modas‌Ltda‌(“C&A‌Brasil”),‌a‌subsidiary‌of‌the‌Cofra‌Holding‌Group,‌
operating in Dhaka, Bangladesh. The submitters alleged that the Cofra Holding Group and C&A Modas Ltda ("C & A Brasil") were to be held co-responsible in the Tazreen plant fire in 2012, which killed
112 people and injured more than 300 others.
In December 2013, the submission was accepted by the Brazilian NCP for further examination.
The NCP and C&A Brazil met in April 2015. C&A Global sent additional documentation to the NCP in May 2015, including information on the Fire Security Program initiated after the fire in Tazreen.
Although‌recognising‌that‌the‌company‌had‌taken‌some‌of‌the‌measures‌to‌meet‌the‌first‌round‌of‌the‌submitter’s‌suggestions,‌the submitter addressed a new set of recommendations to the company in
January 2016. Between February and June 2016, the NCP made several attempts to reach the company in this regard, with no success.
On 8 December 2016, the NCP issued a final statement concluding the specific instance. Noting the measures taken by the company after the fire, the NCP recommends that it continue to improve its
processes and promotion of human rights and decent work conditions in accordance with the OECD Guidelines.

On 12 December 2014, the NGOs Clean Clothes Campaign Denmark and Active Consumers submitted a specific instance to the Danish NCP alleging that PWT Group (a clothing company) had not
observed the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises due to a failure to carry out due diligence in relation to its supplier, the textile manufacturer New Wave Style Ltd. which was located in the
Rana Plaza, Bangladesh, before the collapse of the factory on 24 April 2013.
The NCP conducted an initial assessment, which was completed in June 2015 and the NCP offered mediation to the parties. The parties were unable to agree on a mediated agreement and the
mediation process ended in February 2016.
On 17 March 2016, the NCP decided to conduct an actual investigation of the specific instance.
New Wave Style was located in the Rana Plaza building in Dhaka, Bangladesh, which collapsed on 24 April 2013, killing 1,138 people and injuring more than 2,000. PWT Group has stated that the
company conducts inspections of the working conditions at the factories that manufacture goods for the company, and that an inspection was conducted at New Wave Style in 2012.
The Danish NCP found that the documents submitted by PWT Group did not provide details on checks and inspections that were conducted during the visit, nor whether improvements were required by
PWT‌on‌the‌basis‌of‌the‌inspections.‌Nor‌did‌the‌NCP‌find‌that‌PWT‌has‌submitted‌documentation‌of‌the‌company’s‌risk‌and‌decision making systems, e.g. checklists, used as the basis for inspections
and visits at New Wave Style for the purpose of ensuring health and safety at the workplaces.
The NCP found that PWT Group had not applied processes for due diligence in compliance with the OECD Guidelines. In particular, PWT Group had failed to make demands that New Wave Style ensure
employees’‌basic‌human‌and‌labour‌rights,‌including‌failing‌to‌take‌adequate‌steps‌to‌ensure‌occupational‌health‌and‌safety‌in their operations (see chapter V, paragraph 4c of the OECD Guidelines).
On 17 October 2016, the NCP released its final statement concluding the specific instance and recommending that PWT Group:
Revise its management and risk assessment systems in order to implement processes by which the company can meet the requirement of due diligence in relation to its suppliers, in accordance with
chapter II of the OECD Guidelines.
Ensure‌that‌the‌company’s‌corporate‌social‌responsibility‌policy‌complies‌with‌the‌OECD‌Guidelines.

On 4 May 2015 the French NCP received a submission concerning a social conflict and the dismissal of 311 workers which took place in July 2005 in Mali by a local subsidiary of the French Group
Bouygues‌Construction‌(“Somadex”).‌According‌to‌the‌submitters,‌the‌workers‌were‌dismissed‌in‌retaliation‌for‌striking.‌The‌submission was made by a group of 255 former Somadex workers
represented by M. Yacouba Traore, who is also the Secretary General of a Trade Union of the mining sector in Mali (Fename).
The first version of the submission was not admissible. The NCP proposed to the submitters to redraft it before September 2015, which was done, and deemed admissible even though the submission
was not densely documented. In February 2016 the NCP finished its initial assessment and concluded that the submission did not merit further examination. Prior to reaching this assessment, the NCP
set up a dialogue with the submitters and with the enterprise, Bouygues Construction Group. The enterprise provided detailed responses regarding the submission to the NCP. The NCP also consulted
the‌NGO‌Fédération‌International‌des‌Droits‌de‌l’Homme‌(FIDH)‌which‌had‌investigated‌this‌conflict as well as the Malian gold sector in 2007.
On 13 June 2016 the NCP published a final statement closing the specific instance after the initial assessment. Both parties were consulted in drafting the final statement.
In its decision, the NCP noted that during the incident in question, Somadex was confronted with a breakdown of social dialogue leading to a massive strike. This strike was afterwards recognised and
judged illegal and dismissals for abandonment of post were judged legal. There is no evidence that this judgment was contested. Due to the seriousness of the social conflict, and the illegal actions of the
workers, the enterprise and their social partners at the mine in question (Morila mine) could not maintain constructive negotiations, as recommended by the Guidelines.
The NCP also noted that while FIDH denounced the arrests and the detention of several workers engaged in the social conflict as a violation of human rights, the potential involvement of the enterprise in
these incidents was not‌established.‌The‌NCP‌underlines‌that‌these‌actions‌were‌the‌responsibility‌of‌Malian‌authorities‌and‌that‌“due‌diligence” and‌“business‌relationship”‌were‌not‌concepts‌included‌in‌
the Guidelines in 2005.
In its final statement the NCP includes a determination finding that Somadex did not violate the Guidelines (2000 version). The NCP also notes that currently the Bouygues Construction Group
implements a code of ethics demonstrating lessons learnt from this incident and commits to social dialogue and vocational training for its staff notably in African regions. The NCP recommended that the
Bouygues Construction Group enrich its code of ethics by referencing the Guidelines, in particular, Chapter V which references ILO Declarations and conventions. It also recommends that the enterprise
implement the recommendations of the OECD due diligence guidance for meaningful stakeholder engagement in the extractive sector in the context of its extractive operations.

On 19 August 2015, the French NCP received a submission from the American NGO Americans for Democracy and Human Rights in Bahrain (ADHRD), regarding the sale of security product (tear gas)
by Alsetex, a subsidiary of the Etienne Lacroix Group, to the government of Bahrain. The NGO asked whether human rights had been respected and whether due diligence was applied in the sale of
these security products to Bahrain which could have been used in 2011 and more recently to potentially violate human rights. These tear gas products fall under a specific export regulation in France.
In November 2015, the NCP published its initial assessment which noted that the submission was precise, detailed and well documented and that questions raised by the NGO merited further
consideration. The NCP offered its general good offices and both parties accepted. Given the confidential nature of the sector in question, the NCP asked ADHRBC to sign a non-disclosure agreement.
After this contact with the parties, the NCP offered mediation to discuss the enterprise's due diligence, which Alsetex refused.
The NCP had a constructive dialogue with both parties which led to an agreement. On 4 July 2016, the NCP released a Report (final statement). The NCP notes that specific European and French
regulations on the tear gas export control take into consideration human rights and the potential risks caused by the final use of such products. The NCP notes that the enterprise conducted due diligence
as recommended by the Guidelines through this legal export control system. It noted that the enterprise strictly complied with French regulations and respected the export ban decided by the French
government in 2011 after it was determined that tear gas had been misused in Bahrein in February 2011. By respecting these decisions and regulations, the enterprise complied with the Guidelines and
did not contribute to human rights violations in Bahrain. The NCP also noted that the enterprise has developed risk-based due diligence measures and recommends that the company formalise its risk
management system. The NCP also notes that Alsetex is developing a policy for responsible business conduct, and comments this initiative. The NCP invites Alsetex to use the OECD Guidelines and to
take into account comments provided by ADHRD during this process and release its policy afterwards.

On 4 August 2014 the German NCP received a submission from an individual from Turkey alleging that Nordex SE, a German multinational enterprise, had not observed the environment provisions of the
Guidelines in Turkey. More specifically they alleged that Nordex SE had not properly performed an environmental risk assessment as well as public participation related to a specific project.
In harmony with the implementation procedures, and after consulting with the OECD Investment Committee, the Turkish NCP took the lead on this specific instance and, after an initial assessment,
concluded that the specific instance did not merit further consideration.
Separate to this evaluation, the German NCP assessed the general due diligence issues raised by the individuals. In the initial assessment completed on 8 June 2015, the German NCP accepted part of
the‌submission‌regarding‌Nordex‌SE’s‌due‌diligence‌as‌a‌supplier‌of wind turbines for further consideration.
Following this, the NCP prepared the mediation with both parties and conducted a mediation meeting on 11 February 2016. After additional bilateral talks with both parties, Nordex SE agreed to improve
its due diligence process in the supply of wind turbines (Gate Process). The NCP issued a final statement concluding the specific instance.
A related specific instance was not accepted by the Turkish NCP.

On 25 September 2016, an individual submitted a specific instance to the Italian NCP regarding an Italian bank, and other relevant individuals following the foreclosure of his house due to a non-payment
of credits claimed by the bank.
The submitter stated that the judge had approved the foreclosure and the forced sale in spite of the actions of the Bank, and that that the bank had not observed the Guidelines along with several Italian
laws and regulations, the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
After assessing both the specific instance and the documents submitted, the Italian NCP concluded that the issue raised does not merit further examination because of the following reasons:
The‌issue‌raised,‌including‌the‌alleged‌expropriation‌of‌the‌submitter’s‌house‌is‌still‌pending‌in‌judicial‌proceedings;
With regards to the individuals involved, the instance is inadmissible because they are not covered by the scope of the Guidelines;
The issue brought against the bank is not sufficiently substantiated;
Further examination of the issues raised would not contribute in any way to the purpose and effectiveness of the Guidelines.

On 18 August 2014 the Japanese NCP received a submission from several trade unions (the TowerJazz Branch of Rengo Hokuban Local Union, the Hokuban Local Council of Rengo-Hyogo, RengoHyogo and Rengo (the Japanese Trade Union Confederation) alleging that the multinational company Tower Semiconductor Ltd. headquartered in Israel and its Japanese subsidiary, TowerJazz Japan
Ltd., had not observed the employee and industrial relations provisions of the Guidelines in Japan.
The‌trade‌unions‌alleged‌that‌the‌company‌had‌not‌observed‌the‌company’s‌Rules‌of‌Employment‌regarding‌the‌distribution‌of‌severance‌allowances‌following‌the‌closure‌of‌TowerJazz‌Japan’s‌

unions had no authority to do so.
On 19 January 2015, the Japanese NCP issued an initial assessment accepting the case for further examination.
The NCP asked TowerJazz Japan to engage in dialogue four times between January and October 2015. TowerJazz Japan did not engage with the NCP citing parallel ongoing consultations and
mediation. In January 2016, the NCP offered consultation with Tower Semiconductor but the company took the same position as TowerJazz Japan and did not act on the offer.

In July 2016 the Latvian NCP received a submission from JSC Norvik Bank, a commercial bank.‌‌The‌request‌was‌focused‌on‌the‌efficiency‌and‌transparency‌issues‌of‌Latvia’s‌court‌and‌judicial‌systems‌
and‌actions‌taken‌by‌Prosecutor‌General’s‌Office,‌the‌Financial‌and‌Capital‌Market‌Commission‌and‌the‌Latvian‌State‌Revenue‌Service.
More specifically, JSC Norvik Bank alleged that with regard to the dispute resolution between JSC Norvik Bank and Winergy Ltd., justice is being denied via a deliberately slow and inefficient process.
The Latvian NCP concluded that the issues were not relevant to the implementation of the Guidelines and did not merit further consideration. The reason for the decision is that public institutions and
judicial authorities mentioned in the specific instance cannot be considered multinational enterprises for the purposes of the Guidelines as they are not international in nature and are not engaged in
commercial activities. Furthermore the issue being raised (denial of justice through inefficient process) is outside the scope of the recommendations of the Guidelines.
On 13 October 2016 the NCP closed the specific instance and issued a final statement.

Is of the opinion that disengagement of financial institutions that adhere to the RSPO principles will in general not benefit the goal of sustainability;

On 3 March 2015, the Dutch NCP received a submission from Mr. Bart Stapert regarding alleged human rights impacts by Mylan N.V. in respect of the manufacture of rocuronium bromide and links to
lethal injection execution through sales of the generic medicine in the United States.
Mr. Bart Stapert is an attorney with expertise in the defense of capital punishment cases. In the submission he alleges that Mylan’s‌failure‌to‌restrict‌the‌sale‌of‌its‌products‌to‌prisons‌in‌the United States
risks enabling the execution of prisoners using rocuronium bromide in violation of their right to life and, potentially, their right not to be subjected to cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment. The
submission refers to alleged non-observance of the General Policies chapter and the commentary on Human Rights in the Guidelines.
In the view of Mr. Bart Stapert, Mylan should acknowledge the risk that without distribution controls in place its medicines may be purchased by prisons in the United States and used to execute prisoners,
investigate what distribution controls it may impose, take swift action to implement comprehensive distribution controls, try to prevent the use of any Mylan medicines which may already have been sold to
prisons and publish‌a‌policy‌statement‌confirming‌Mylan’s‌commitment‌to‌human‌rights,‌in‌particular‌to‌the‌human‌rights‌abuses‌associated with the use of medicines in lethal injection executions.
On 21 April 2015, Mylan submitted an initial response following the submission by Mr. Bart Stapert concerning the issues raised in this specific instance. The company states that it has never delivered,
marketed or distributed rocuronium bromide for use in lethal executions, nor received or filed an order from any prison or other entity for use of the medicine in connection with a lethal injection. The
company also challenged the jurisdiction of the Dutch NCP stating that the submission ought to be heard by the US NCP. Furthermore, the company contends that the demanded measures to be taken
are beyond its control and that the issue is more one of ethical and public policy debate.
The initial assessment of the Dutch NCP concluded that the issues raised merited further consideration and the Dutch NCP therefore accepted the specific instance and offered its good offices to both
parties. The Dutch NCP noted that, although in principle a notification should have been filed at the NCP where the alleged problems were occurring (in this instance the United States), the NCP has
consulted with the US NCP and agreed that the Dutch NCP will handle this specific instance to affect change at the highest corporate entity in the Netherlands.
Both‌parties‌accepted‌the‌NCP’s‌offer‌to‌engage‌in‌mediation‌and‌met‌in‌November‌2015‌to‌start‌a‌dialogue facilitated by the NCP aimed at resolving the issue at hand. The parties agreed to continue a
constructive dialogue after the meeting. The NCP has made some recommendations in addition to the due diligence recommendations in the Guidelines and closed the specific instance on 11 April 2016
by publishing a final statement.
The NCP is of the opinion that distributors and purchasers of, in this case, medicines distributed or purchased for purposes that are inconsistent with approved labelling and applicable medical standards
of care fall under a business relationship. The NCP concludes that the Guidelines are applicable to both the supply chain and the distribution chain.
The NCP encourages pharmaceutical companies to work with different stakeholders such as distributors, human rights organisations and others to prevent rocuronium bromide and other medicines being
used in lethal injections and suggests that Mylan shares the outcome of this matter and its due diligence steps with other companies in the sector.
The NCP recommends that an evaluation be conducted in March 2017 to assess the outcomes of the mediation and ensure that Mylan’s‌products‌are‌being‌used‌properly‌and‌prevent‌use‌of‌medicine‌in‌
lethal injections. The NCP anticipates a positive outcome of the steps taken by Mylan in the distribution chain. The evaluation will be published on the Dutch NCP website.

On 8 June 2015 the Dutch NGO Both ENDS – in conjunction with and on behalf of the Brazilian NGOs Associação Fórum Suape Espaço Socioambiental, Conectas Direitos Humanos and Colônia de
Pescadores do Município do Cabo de Santo Agostinho – submitted a specific instance to the Dutch NCP.
The submission alleged that the Atradius Dutch State Business (ADSB), the official credit insurance agency of the Netherlands, had not observed the Guidelines. The allegations relate to the provision of
export credit insurance on behalf of and for the account of the Dutch State with respect to dredging projects by the Dutch company Van Oord for the Suape Industrial Port Complex in Suape, Brazil.
Parallel notifications were lodged with Van Oord Marine Ingenuity (Rotterdam), Van Oord Serviçios de Operações Marítimas Ltda (Rio de Janeiro) and Complexo Industrial Portuário Eraldo Gueiros –
Empresa Suape, Pernambuco, which are considered by the Brazilian NCP.
On 3 December 2015, the NCP published its initial assessment accepting the specific instance for further examination. The NCP offered its mediation services to the parties with the objective of helping
the‌parties‌reach‌an‌agreement‌on‌the‌NCP’s‌recommendations‌regarding‌addressing‌issues‌connected‌to‌the‌case‌itself‌and‌issues relating to due diligence, monitoring and leverage for the export credit
agency sector on the basis of the Guidelines. Both parties accepted and participated in several meetings between January 2016 and July 2016, enabling constructive dialogue to take place on the topics
of disclosure, due diligence, and monitoring and evaluation between the submitters, and ADSB and the Ministry of Finance.
On 30 November 2016, the NCP published a final statement concluding the specific instance. The NCP concluded that both the contracting party (CIPS, the commissioning company in Suape) and the
contractor (Van Oord) could have improved their due diligence activities, including consultation with affected stakeholders.
The NCP plans to follow-up on the outcomes of the dialogue in October 2017.

On 15 June 2015 two individuals, through their representative NGO, filed a specific instance alleging breaches of their human rights by Southern Response Earthquake Services Limited (Southern

made after the 2010/11 Canterbury earthquake sequence had breached their rights to health, property, adequate housing and the rights of children and persons with disabilities.
Southern Response is a Government-owned company established to settle claims by policyholders of Allied Mutual Insurance (AMI) for Canterbury earthquake damage which occurred before 5 April
2012. AMI was a local Mutual insurance company, owned by policyholders through the AMI Member Trust, which operated only within New Zealand. Large losses after the earthquakes eventually saw
the‌restructuring‌and‌sale‌of‌the‌company,‌and‌the‌Government‌taking‌on‌responsibility‌for‌managing‌AMI’s‌existing‌Canterbury earthquake claims as Southern Response. The rest of the business was
bought by the Insurance Australia Group (IAG).
The submitters argued that despite being owned by Government, Southern Response undertakes commercial activities through its management of the‌AMI‌claims,‌and‌its‌use‌of‌AMI’s‌available‌
reinsurance cover and international reinsurance generally, establishes the international link required to bring it within the scope of the Guidelines. The submitters also alleged that NZPT had a linked
business‌relationship‌with‌AMI‌and‌Southern‌Response‌because‌of‌their‌then‌role‌as‌trustee‌for‌the‌AMI‌Member‌Trust,‌AMI’s‌activities requiring international reinsurance, and because in undertaking its
business as a professional trustee, NZPT is itself engaged in numerous international investment activities.
Following investigation and consideration of the claim, the NCP rejected it on 9 March 2016 as being out of scope of the Guidelines and informed the claimants that it would not be proceeded with, as

neither Southern Response nor NZPT is a multinational enterprise (MNE). The final statement was issued in December 2016.
Southern Response is entirely owned by the New Zealand Government, and only operates in New Zealand. It does not compete in the insurance market, has a purely domestic operation, and does not
have a transnational focus. In terms of reinsurance, obtaining goods or services from overseas does not, in itself, make an entity an MNE. NZPT is a registered New Zealand company. It operates in

the‌restructuring‌and‌sale‌of‌the‌company,‌and‌the‌Government‌taking‌on‌responsibility‌for‌managing‌AMI’s‌existing‌Canterbury earthquake claims as Southern Response. The rest of the business was
bought by the Insurance Australia Group (IAG).
The submitters argued that despite being owned by Government, Southern Response undertakes commercial activities through its management‌ of‌ the‌ AMI‌ claims,‌ and‌ its‌ use‌ of‌ AMI’s‌ available‌
reinsurance cover and international reinsurance generally, establishes the international link required to bring it within the scope of the Guidelines. The submitters also alleged that NZPT had a linked
business relationship with AMI and Southern Response because of their then role as trustee for the AMI Member‌Trust,‌AMI’s‌activities‌requiring‌international‌reinsurance,‌and‌because‌in‌undertaking‌its‌
business as a professional trustee, NZPT is itself engaged in numerous international investment activities.
Following investigation and consideration of the claim, the NCP rejected it on 9 March 2016 as being out of scope of the Guidelines and informed the claimants that it would not be proceeded with, as
neither Southern Response nor NZPT is a multinational enterprise (MNE). The final statement was issued in December 2016.
Southern Response is entirely owned by the New Zealand Government, and only operates in New Zealand. It does not compete in the insurance market, has a purely domestic operation, and does not
have a transnational focus. In terms of reinsurance, obtaining goods or services from overseas does not, in itself, make an entity an MNE. NZPT is a registered New Zealand company. It operates in
New‌Zealand‌and‌is‌wholly‌owned‌by‌Public‌Trust‌(a‌government‌entity).‌NZPT’s‌engagement‌with‌AMP’s‌Superannuation‌Master‌Trust‌did‌not‌make‌it‌an‌MNE,‌nor‌could‌AMI’s‌reinsurance‌activities‌
sensibly make the NZPT an MNE.

On 21 April 2009, the Peruvian NCP received a submission from the Central Única de Trabajadores del Perú (CUT) alleging that the rights of mining workers had not been observed during the closure
process of a mine in Peru, managed by Perubar S.A., a subsidiary of the Swiss multinational Glencore Mineral A.G.
On 18 June 2009, the NCP released its initial assessment. Although a judicial process was already underway the NCP decided to offer its good offices to promote dialogue between the parties.
The NCP held several meetings with the parties involved and also proposed that both parties meet without the NCP in order to reach an out of court settlement. After these meetings, the company
expressed its intention to address the issue in the conciliation phase of a regular judicial process.
In February 2014, the first instance court handling this matter issued a judgment. CUT considered this judgment unfavourable and appealed. The NCP reiterated its efforts to help the parties reach an out
of court settlement and met with both parties but the company decided not to engage in further dialogue with the CUT as it was satisfied with the judgement rendered.
As a result, the NCP considered that it would not be possible to achieve an agreement amongst the parties and issued a final statement (Spanish) on 16 May 2016.
In its final statement, the NCP recognised that its offer of good offices alone could not make a positive contribution to the resolution of the issues raised due to ongoing parallel proceedings. The NCP
also acknowledged that it could not make a legal judgment with regard to the alleged non-observance but concluded that CUT had not sufficiently demonstrated that Perubar had not observed the OECD
Guidelines.

In October 2012 the Swedish and Norwegian NCPs received a submission from the Sami reindeer herding collective in Jijnjevaerie Sami Village alleging that Statkraft AS, a Norwegian multinational
enterprise, had not observed the general policies, human rights, and environment provisions of the Guidelines by planning to build a wind power plant on reindeer herding ground in Sweden.
The Sami reindeer herding collective acknowledge that Statkraft had consulted with the community during the planning stages of the wind power plant, but content that "meaningful engagement" had not
taken place. They requested that the NCPs mediate between the parties to reach such a positive solution to the situation.

The NCPs met with both parties during the initial assessment process. The NCPs had decided to defer the case as a bilateral dialogue between the parties had been renewed since the submission was
received by the NCPs. In September 2013, however, the Saami village again requested the NCPs to facilitate mediation and a mediation process was initiated. Mediation took place during the course of
2014 but no agreement could be reached.
The‌NCPs‌of‌Sweden‌and‌Norway‌have‌therefore‌assessed‌Statkraft’s‌compliance‌with‌the‌OECD‌Guidelines,‌which‌they‌present‌in‌their joint final statement along with their recommendations for future
cooperation. For various reasons, the process has taken a disproportionately long time, and the NCPs regret this.
The‌main‌question‌in‌the‌complaint‌is‌whether‌Statkraft‌has‌taken‌account‌of‌the‌Saami‌village’s‌interests‌and‌respected‌their human rights in connection with the wind power project, including carrying
out risk-based human rights diligence and consulting with the Saami village.
The NCPs have not found any grounds for concluding that Statkraft has failed to comply with the OECD Guidelines. The NCPs have pointed to some areas where there is room for improvement, including
that Statkraft/Statkraft SCA Vind AB‌(SSVAB)‌can‌work‌in‌a‌manner‌that‌even‌more‌clearly‌promotes‌indigenous‌people’s‌rights‌and‌the‌implementation‌of‌the‌Guidelines.
The NCPs recommend that the parties show renewed will to negotiate an agreement on the further development of the wind power projects, their scope and extent and compensation schemes.
In a press release dated 24 August 2016, the NCPs of Sweden and Norway congratulated the parties on reaching an agreement on their own following the conclusion of the NCP process.

The NGO Americans for Democracy and Human Rights in Bahrain (ADHRB) filed a submission alleging that Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) has not observed the OECD
Guidelines by allowing Sheikh Salman bin Ibrahim Al Khalifa to stand for candidacy in the FIFA presidential election without first carrying out adequate due diligence regarding human rights. According to
the submitting party, the presidential candidate was responsible for punitive measures against football clubs and players in respect of their support for pro-democracy protests in Bahrain in 2011.
In its initial assessment issued on 17 August 2016, the NCP did not accept the submission for the following reasons, among others: firstly, the activities mentioned in the submission were not of a
commercial nature and therefore the NCP found that the OECD Guidelines were not applicable to this specific case; secondly, the OECD Guidelines do not foresee human rights due diligence for such
election processes and therefore the alleged activities are not in the scope of the OECD Guidelines.

legal parallel proceedings. The local court decided in favour of reinstatement of workers in April 2016. On 10 November 2014 the Turkish NCP received a submission from a trade union alleging that a

Following the initial assessment phase, the Turkish NCP offered its good offices by proposing to hold joint meetings and mediation between the parties. In a letter to the NCP dated 11 August 2016, the
company representatives informed the NCP that the company did not wish to participate in the joint meetings. The letter also stated that the representatives believed the complaint was unfounded and the
OECD Guidelines had not been violated during their activities in Turkey.
On these grounds, the Turkish NCP concluded the specific instance and issued a final statement on 2 November 2016.

In May 2013, the UK NCP received a submission from the NGOs Rights and Accountability in Development (RAID) and Action Contre l’Impunité‌pour‌les‌Droits Humains (ACIDH) alleging that Eurasian
Natural Resources Corporation (ENRC) had not observed the general policies and human rights provisions of the Guidelines with its mining activities in the Democratic Republic Of Congo.
In September 2013 the NCP has conducted an initial assessment and concluded that the specific instance merits further examination. The details of the NCP's decision and next steps are outlined in their
initial assessment.
The parties accepted an offer of mediation, but failed to reach an agreement. The UK NCP began its further examination of the complaint in February 2015 and issued a final statement to the parties in
August 2015.
On 19 August 2015, a Request was made on behalf of ENRC for by the UK National Contact Point. Upon completion of the review process the final statement on the specific instance was publically
released‌in‌February‌2016‌along‌with‌the‌NCP‌Steering‌Board’s‌conclusions‌on‌the‌review‌of‌the‌final‌statement.‌
The final statement found that based on the information considered, ENRC had not engaged effectively with two stakeholder communities on the concession and had not taken adequate steps to address
impacts on the communities that arise from delays in taking forward mining projects, and therefore determined that ENRC has not met obligations under the Guidelines.
In the final statement the UK NCP issued recommendations on how ENRC could better engage with the local communities and apply leverage on its business partners to avoid and address adverse
impacts. The UK NCP will make a follow-up statement on this specific instance in February 2017.

On 14 July 2015, an individual submitted a specific instance to the NCP regarding his treatment by his employer, an energy company in Cameroon, between 2002 and 2014. The submission referred to a
UK investment company that in 2014 acquired a majority shareholding in the employer company in Cameroon. The submission alleged that the UK investment company failed to improve the poor
governance practices of the energy company, referring to alleged unjustified and arbitrary changes to the position and salary of the submitter, and the falsification or withholding of employment records.
The NCP invited the UK investment company to respond. The company noted that it does not have any role in day to day management of the submitter’s‌employer,‌but‌that‌on‌acquiring‌its‌shareholding,‌
it made some changes to personnel and policies of this company to strengthen its corporate governance. It also noted that most events referred to in the submission occurred before its shareholding, and
that‌the‌submitter’s‌employment‌dispute‌had‌been‌addressed‌through‌the‌proper‌process‌and‌the‌compensation‌legally‌due‌to‌him‌has been paid.
The UK NCP did not accept the specific instance for further examination. The information provided shows that the submitter may have a genuine employment grievance, but the UK NCP does not
consider that the information substantiates an issue about the observance of the Guidelines by the UK company named.
In June 2016, the UK NCP published an initial assessment not accepting the submission.

Between June and August 2016, the NCP communicated with the NGOs and the company separately. The NCP made an offer to hold a meeting with both parties to explain the NCP process, which
neither party accepted.
On 14 October 2016, the UK NCP published its initial assessment not accepting the specific instance for further examination citing a lack of substantiation of the claims made by the NGOs and that
considering the submission further would not serve the purpose and effectiveness of the Guidelines.

In November 2013, the US NCP received a specific instance from the International Union of Food, Agricultural, Hotel, Restaurant,‌Catering,‌Tobacco‌and‌Allied‌Works’‌Associations‌(IUF)‌alleging‌
that PepsiCo India, a subsidiary of PepsiCo Inc. did not observe the Guidelines in India.
Specifically it was alleged that between 5 January and 30 April 2013, 162 workers of 170 employed at 3 West Bengal warehouses contracted exclusively by PepsiCo were dismissed or compelled to
resign solely as a consequence of exercising their right to join a union. IUF stated that PepsiCo, through its subsidiary in India, contracts these workers through Radhakrishna Food Land Pvt. Ltd. (RKFL),
and‌in‌this‌capacity‌has‌facilitated‌workers’‌rights abuses through this subcontracting relationship. According to the IUF, PepsiCo had failed to perform the required human rights due diligence and
therefore tacitly allowed these violations to persist.
In‌response,‌PepsiCo‌emphasized‌that‌the‌IUF’s‌complaint focused on the alleged actions of its contractor, and not PepsiCo or its subsidiary. PepsiCo maintains that the strike that led to the termination
of the workers was illegal, as the strikers did not provide the required notice under Indian law. Regardless, PepsiCo stated that it did in fact use its relationship with RKFL to secure offers of reemployment to 28 of the workers that the IUF claims were specific victims of human rights violations. PepsiCo claims that the ultimate reason for the IUF complaint rests not on the alleged violations of
the‌Guidelines‌in‌its‌relationship‌with‌RKFL;‌rather‌it‌stems‌from‌PepsiCo’s‌refusal‌to‌enter‌into‌a‌formal‌global‌“relationship”‌with‌the‌IUF.‌Because‌it‌had‌already‌engaged‌in‌multiple‌discussions‌with‌the‌
IUF and investigated their claims, PepsiCo declined the NCP's offer of mediation.
The NCP offered its good office for mediation with the view that it might further dialogue between RKFL and its employees, supported by the IUF and PepsiCo.
On 14 March 2014 PepsiCo responded that it had already engaged in discussions directly with the IUF and because of the inability to reach an agreement on the issues in question, PepsiCo declined the
NCP’s‌offer‌of‌mediation.‌The‌NCP‌therefore‌concluded‌the‌specific‌instance‌and issued a public statement regarding the outcomes.
In November 2015, PepsiCo reached out to the NCP to ask if mediation would still be available. The NCP agreed to mediate the case and both parties returned to the table.
Although they were not able to reach a mediated agreement, the parties and the USNCP found the dialogue and mediation process to be productive and useful.
On 15 April 2016, the NCP released a final statement concluding the specific instance in which it recommended that PepsiCo update its Human Rights Workplace Policy, committing itself explicitly to the
Guidelines and incorporating the human rights and labour chapters of the Guidelines as the standard for PepsiCo activities. PepsiCo has informed the USNCP that an update is already underway.
The NCP commends both parties for their willingness to continue to work to resolve these issues and for their decision to return to the Specific Instance, even after it had been declared concluded, to
make an attempt at a mediated solution.

On 9 February 2015, IUF, an international federation of trade unions, submitted a specific instance to the US NCP alleging conduct inconsistent with the chapters on General Policies, Human Rights and
Employment and Industrial Relations of the OECD Guidelines by Starwood affiliates in the Maldives and Ethiopia.
The US NCP determined that the matters raised merited further consideration and were relevant to the implementation of the Guidelines. As a result, on 9 July 2015, the US NCP issued an initial
assessment to the parties offering mediation which was accepted by both parties.
On 12 May 2016 the NCP published a final statement indicating that the mediation had resulted in agreement between the two parties. A statement was released upon conclusion of the mediation noting
that:
“Both‌parties‌have‌participated‌in‌the‌mediation‌process‌in‌good‌faith‌resulting‌in‌a‌successful‌outcome.‌The‌parties‌have‌reached full resolution of the concerns raised by IUF pertaining to the discharge
of workers and the collective bargaining process at the Sheraton Addis Ababa hotel. In regards to Sheraton Maldives, the parties shall reconvene at an agreed location to continue to explore options in

In its final statement, the US NCP recommended that Starwood review their human rights policies and supplier code of conduct to make reference to the guidance on responsible business conduct
available in the OECD Guidelines and indicated it would follow up with the parties within a year.

On 23 June 2016, European Centre for Democracy and Human Rights, Defenders for Medical Impartiality, and Arabian Rights Watch Association (collectively‌ “the‌ Submitters”),‌ human‌ rights‌ nongovernmental organisations, submitted a specific instance to the NCP alleging that the Boeing Company and Lockheed Martin Corporation‌(collectively‌“the‌Companies”)‌did‌not‌observe‌the‌Guidelines.‌
The events addressed in the specific instance cover a period from March 2015 to the submission date.
The submitters alleged that the companies failed to take appropriate steps to ensure that their products did not cause or contribute to human rights abuses, and that‌the‌companies’‌products‌ directly‌
contributed to adverse human rights impacts in Yemen through their use by the government of Saudi Arabia. The submitters also claimed that the companies did not have a relevant human rights policy
and did not carry out appropriate human rights due diligence in the sale of their products.
After thorough review of information provided, the NCP decided not to offer mediation, noting that the purpose of the Guidelines is to promote responsible business conduct by multinational enterprises.
The specific instance concerned the conduct of particular States, and would have entailed an examination of state conduct, which would not serve to advance the Guidelines.
More specifically, the NCP noted that this specific instance is inextricably intertwined with the practices of specific states, including Saudi Arabia and the United States. Arms sales to Saudi Arabia were

completed through two processes: transfers completed by the U.S. government through the FMS program and Direct Commercial Sales (DCS) in which the exports were approved by the U.S.
government. All arms transfer decisions are reviewed and approved under the criteria outlined in the Conventional Arms Transfer (CAT) Policy as detailed in Presidential Policy Directive 27 (PPD-27,
January 15, 2014). Under PPD-27,‌the‌criteria‌considered‌includes‌the‌“likelihood‌that‌the‌recipient‌would‌use‌the‌arms‌to‌commit‌human‌rights‌abuses‌or‌serious violations of international humanitarian
law, retransfer the arms to those who would commit human rights abuses or serious violations of international humanitarian law". Additionally, for DCS cases, the State Department considers, pursuant to
section‌38(a)(2)‌of‌the‌AECA,‌ among‌ other‌factors,‌ whether‌ the‌ sale‌ would‌ “increase‌ the‌ possibility‌ of‌outbreak‌ or‌ escalation‌ of‌conflict”‌ or‌ “support‌international‌ terrorism".‌The‌ decision‌ to‌ use‌ arms‌
procured from the United States or these companies is a decision made by Saudi Arabia in its capacity as a sovereign state. However, the use must be consistent with the provisions of the agreement, or
license, that was the basis for the sale or approval of the transfer.
Accordingly, this specific instance concerns various state practices, which NCPs are not designed to assess.
This led the NCP to close the specific instance on 18 November 2016. In its final statement, the NCP encouraged all U.S. companies in every sector to carry out human rights due diligence and avoid
causing or contributing to adverse human rights impacts, and to consider referencing the OECD Guidelines in company human rights commitments. The NCP also noted that the U.S. government
regularly engages with civil society and other stakeholders regarding any concerns with U.S. policy, including on the issues raised in the specific instance, and is available to discuss the issues further
with the submitters.

ANNEX 7. BELGIUM NCP PEER REVIEW REPORT: KEY FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

Annex 7
Belgium NCP peer review report:
Key findings and recommendations
The report of the Belgium NCP peer review was addressed at the meeting of the
National Contact Points in June 2016.1 A summary of the main findings and
recommendations follows:
Belgium adhered to the OECD Declaration on International Investment and
Multinational Enterprises (Investment Declaration) in 1976 and created an NCP in 1980.
The Belgian NCP benefits from strong institutional memory along with experience of
handling a total of 17 specific instances between 2000 and 2015. The NCP is based in the
Ministry of Economy which is known as the Federal Public Service Economy in
Belgium. The NCP benefits from a tripartite structure, bringing together representatives
of various government departments, employer organisations and trade unions.
The Belgian NCP has been active both in its promotion of the Guidelines and in its
handling of specific instances. The specific instances received by the NCP have covered a
wide range of topics and the NCP has each time taken steps to build constructive dialogue
between the parties involved. The members of the NCP secretariat are committed to the
work of the NCP and have maintained NCP activities in spite of limited resources
available.
Institutional arrangements: The tripartite structure of the NCP with its 17 members
is designed to reflect a diversity of views during the NCP specific instance process. In
addition, the NCP is supported by a large advisory body of experts covering a range of
expertise. The institutional memory within the office is strong. Since 2012, all NCP
records have been stored electronically. It is projected to use the government plan for the
transmission of knowledge should there be staff changes in the future.
However, the Belgian NCP has limited resources available and no designated budget
for NCP activities or for providing mediation services. The role of the members of the
NCP is unclear (length of mandate, functions, competencies etc.) and there is no process
in place for the appointment of a new chair or to ensure continuity in case of changes in
secretariat staff. In addition, there are no written procedures available explaining how the
NCP works and what the decision powers of the NCP members and of its secretariat are.
Core criteria:



1

120

Visibility: The Belgian NCP has a dedicated website which is available in Dutch
and in French. The website contains a number of helpful resources and includes
final statements and press releases for specific instances. The website is not easy
to find through online searches since it is situated several layers into the ministry
of economy website.

Belgium National Contact Point Peer Review Report

ANNUAL REPORT ON THE OECD GUIDELINES FOR MULTINATIONAL ENTERPRISES 2016 ©OECD 2017

-----------------------Page 122 End-----------------------

ANNEX 7. BELGIUM NCP PEER REVIEW REPORT: KEY FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS



Accessibility: The NCP has a long-standing relationship with NGOs and civil
society in general and responds to requests for appointments.



Transparency: The Belgian NCP publishes final statements of specific instances
and makes them available on its website; these statements are most often
accompanied by a press release. In addition, the Belgian NCP reports annually to
the OECD Investment Committee and makes these reports available on its
website. However, the Belgian NCP does not produce a written initial
assessment; the initial assessment is an oral agreement between the NCP
members.



Accountability: The NCP reports annually to the Minister of Economy; however
there is no formal reporting requirement within the government on the activities
of the NCP.
Findings

Recommendations

1.1

The functioning of the NCP at present is
dependent upon a few key figures,
notably the Chair and secretariat
members and there are few written
procedures beyond the legal instrument
establishing the NCP.

Belgium should establish written
procedures regarding the practical
functioning of the NCP, including the
procedure for appointing a chair, to
ensure clarity and continuity. Such
procedures should be made available
online.

1.2

There is confusion regarding the various
roles of members of the NCP and the
expert network.

Belgium should ensure the roles of
members of the NCP and the expert
network are clearly explained and
provide information regarding members
based in different government
departments.

1.3

There are limited human and financial
resources available to the Belgian NCP
and no dedicated budget for
mediation/conciliation expertise.

Belgium should ensure that sufficient
human and financial resources are
made available to the NCP, including
funds for mediation purposes.

1.4

A National Action Plan on Business and
Human Rights is in the process of being
developed and will include a section on
the NCP.

Belgium should ensure the role of NCP
and promotion of the Guidelines is
integrated into the National Action Plan
and take steps to align policy objectives
by increasing the resources available to
the NCP.

1.5

There is no formal reporting requirement
within the government on the activities of
the NCP.

Belgium should create an internal
reporting mechanism within the
government or parliament for the NCP
to demonstrate accountability. As part
of this exercise, the Belgian NCP could
request a regular budget.

Promotion of the Guidelines: the promotional strategy of the Belgian NCP could be
enhanced to focus on organisations less familiar with the work of the NCP. In addition,
there was some confusion with regards the respective roles of the NCP members and the
ANNUAL REPORT ON THE OECD GUIDELINES FOR MULTINATIONAL ENTERPRISES 2016 ©OECD 2017

121

-----------------------Page 123 End-----------------------

ANNEX 7. BELGIUM NCP PEER REVIEW REPORT: KEY FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

expert network, along with a lack of awareness of the scope of the Guidelines. To
increase efficiency and impact, alignment with the promotion of the future National
Action Plan on Business and Human Rights could be helpful.
Findings

Recommendations

2.1

The promotional activities of the NCP to
date have tended to focus on
organisations already familiar with the
work of the NCP.

The Belgian NCP should develop a
promotional strategy that ensures
greater outreach to companies
(including small and medium-sized
enterprises), trade unions, NGOs and
other NCPs. In addition, the NCP
should promote the Guidelines to
Belgian embassies in countries where
Belgian companies are present.

2.2

The multiplicity of standards on RBC is
sometimes seen as a barrier to
awareness-raising on the OECD
Guidelines.

The Belgian NCP could work in
partnerships with other organisations to
ensure successful promotion of all
RBC-related standards (e.g. ISO
26000, UNGP, UNGC, sector specific
RBC/CSR standards).

2.3

There were sometimes
misunderstandings regarding the role of
the NCP and the scope of application of
the Guidelines.

The Belgian NCP could improve
information available on the NCP
website to clarify the role of the NCP
and help set expectations. It would be
helpful to clarify the scope of the
Guidelines.

Handling of specific instances: The Belgian NCP has handled a total of 17 specific
instances since 2000. Over this time, the final statements have become more
comprehensive and addressed a variety of complex topics. In certain instances, the NCP
has made recommendations to business or determinations finding that a company has not
observed the Guidelines. However, there are no written procedures available explaining
the specific instance process, or guidance for bringing a specific instance to the NCP. In
addition, members of the NCP are not trained mediators and there is an absence of human
rights expertise. Finally, there are no non-governmental organisations represented
amongst the NCP membership.

122

Findings

Recommendations

3.1

There are no procedures available on
the NCP website explaining how the
specific instance procedure functions or
how to bring a specific instance to the
NCP.

The Belgian NCP should make the
specific instance procedures available
on its website, including guidance
explaining the process for bringing a
specific instance.

3.2

The lack of a written initial assessment
can produce a lack of clarity in the
proceedings

The Belgian NCP should make its initial
assessment a written document to
improve clarity between parties. The
Belgian NCP may also consider making
the initial assessment public.

3.3

There is little recourse to external
professional mediators and only the

The Belgian NCP should involve more
individuals trained in mediation in the

ANNUAL REPORT ON THE OECD GUIDELINES FOR MULTINATIONAL ENTERPRISES 2016 ©OECD 2017

-----------------------Page 124 End-----------------------

ANNEX 7. BELGIUM NCP PEER REVIEW REPORT: KEY FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

Chair has received mediation training in
the past. The procedures do not ensure
the creation of terms of reference
setting out the scope of the mediation.

composition of the NCP and/or ensure
mediation practices are observed in the
dialogue process such as creating an
agreed set of terms of reference. In
addition, the cooperation with external
professional mediators could be
evaluated.

3.4

The Belgian NCP is receiving a low
number of specific instances per year
and this number has been gradually
decreasing.

The Belgian NCP could work with local
stakeholders to develop NGO
awareness of the Guidelines and the
NCP process, highlighting
developments in the 2011 version of the
Guidelines.

3.5

Concerns were raised by some
stakeholders regarding delays in
producing an initial assessment in four
cases.

The Belgian NCP should endeavour to
meet the timeliness criteria set out in
the Procedural Guidance and
communicate with complainants and
companies on progress.

3.6

Concerns were raised by some
stakeholders regarding how parallel
proceedings impacted a particular
specific instance.

The Belgian NCP should ensure that
parallel proceedings do not represent
the sole reason for deciding that issues
do not merit further consideration.

3.7

There is a lack of expertise in handling
specific instances related to human
rights.

The Belgian NCP should focus on
building capacity to handle specific
instances covering all aspects of the
Guidelines, including through
cooperating with embassies and
international organisations.

3.8

Some stakeholders raised a concern
regarding information that had been
shared by a company with the NCP but
not subsequently with the NGO bringing
the specific instance

The Belgian NCP should create written
procedures to ensure clarity in such
matters going forward which respects
the principle of equitability whereby
both parties are kept equally informed
or if this is not possible, such evidence
should not inform the final decision.

3.9

Some stakeholders raised the
importance of follow-up by the NCP to
encourage implementation of the
recommendations.

The Belgian NCP should include a
standard practice on monitoring as part
of the overall procedures to allow for
follow-up within a set period of time.

3.10

The NCP is made up of a large number
of members, many from various
government departments. It is not
possible to distinguish between actual
members of the NCP involved in
specific instances and those that play
an advisory role. Furthermore, there are
no NGO representatives on the NCP.

Belgium should consider how to clarify
the current composition of the NCP,
including making the distinction
between NCP members and members
of the expert network clearer (functions,
competences). In addition, Belgium
should consider the inclusion of NGO
representatives.

ANNEX 7. BELGIUM NCP PEER REVIEW REPORT: KEY FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

Proactive agenda: The Belgian NCP promotes the projects under the proactive
agenda through sectoral seminars or roundtables. In 2014 the NCP held three events with
a sector-specific focus covering the garment industry and conflict minerals. The NCP has
noted that a lack of resources and budget prevents more work from being done to promote
the guidance documents coming out of the proactive agenda projects.

4.1

Findings

Recommendation

The Belgian NCP noted that a lack of
resources and budget prevents more
work from being done to promote the
guidance documents coming out of
the proactive agenda projects.

The Belgian NCP could focus on
outreach to one sector per year as part
of a promotional strategy.

Policy coherence: The Belgian NCP is part of the internal working party on
responsible business conduct which is responsible for the development of a National
Action Plan on business and human rights in accordance with the UN Guiding Principles
on Business and Human Rights and the EU strategy for corporate social responsibility.
Other parts of the Belgian government could be informed of NCP recommendations to
ensure policy coherence in practice.
Findings
5.1

124

Recommendation

The Belgian NCP is part of the internal
working party on responsible business
conduct which is responsible for the
development of a National Action Plan
on business and human rights. It is not
clear, how promotion of the guidelines
is aligned with the promotion of this
action plan.

In order to increase
efficiency and impact,
the Belgium NCP could
align the promotion of
the OECD Guidelines
with
the
general
promotion according to
the Belgium National
Action
Plan
on
Business and Human
Rights. In addition, this
would contribute to
improving the political
support to the NCP.

ANNEX 10. STATEMENTS BY INSTITUTIONAL STAKEHOLDERS

Annex 10
Statements by institutional stakeholders
Business and Advisory Committee (BIAC)
Business, as represented by Business at OECD (BIAC), has long recognized the
importance of responsible business conduct in a globalized world. BIAC considers
responsible business conduct, as promoted by the MNE Guidelines, to be an essential part
of an open investment climate and in the best interest of business.
To that end, BIAC is committed to work in partnership with the OECD, national
governments and multinational enterprises, in order to support effective implementation
of the MNE Guidelines promoting them in adhering countries and beyond. To raise
awareness of the MNE Guidelines among companies, BIAC and its member associations
organized and participated in multiple events in the course of 2016.
BIAC provided the business perspective on the OECD’s work on responsible business
conduct and due diligence at a meeting organized by its German member BDA in
February and spoke at a meeting on the MNE Guidelines in Vienna in October. BIAC
also presented the business perspective on the MNE Guidelines at a major conference in
Budapest in October and spoke at a Roundtable on the Forty Years of the OECD MNE
Guidelines, which took place at the OECD in December 2016. The 2016 annual BIAC
General Assembly included a special session to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the
OECD Declaration on International Investment and Multinational Enterprises, of which
the Guidelines are a key part.
BIAC also highlighted the importance of the MNE Guidelines in other international
discussions, including in the context of the B20, where BIAC is engaged as a member and
network partner. BIAC underlined the importance of effective implementation and
outreach regarding key OECD instruments, including the MNE Guidelines.
BIAC maintained a strong presence at the annual OECD Global Forum on
Responsible Business Conduct in June 2016. BIAC also remained an active partner in the
projects on the proactive agenda of the MNE Guidelines, so as to ensure that the concrete
experience of different sectors, including most recently finance and textiles, is duly
reflected. BIAC members were active in the various advisory groups and related
conferences, as well as the May 2016 Forum on Responsible Mineral Supply Chains.
BIAC has been and will continue to be actively involved in the discussions on the general
due diligence guidance to ensure that the final outcome will be of practical use to
business, recognizing both business opportunities and challenges in this context.
BIAC continued to call for active outreach efforts to non-adhering countries and
highlighted the role of the MNE Guidelines, not only to BIAC members but also observer
organizations. For further information, please check the BIAC brochure on the MNE
Guidelines, available on the BIAC website, which was issued to ensure that companies
are aware of this key instrument and its concrete implications for business.

ANNEX 10. STATEMENTS BY INSTITUTIONAL STAKEHOLDERS

OECD Watch
As a network of over 100 civil society organizations from around the world, OECD
Watch continues to monitor the effectiveness of National Contact Points (NCPs) in
promoting corporate adherence to the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises
(the Guidelines) and access to remedy for victims of corporate misconduct.
In order to mark the 40th Anniversary of the Guidelines, OECD Watch published a
briefing for policymakers in June entitled “A “4x10” Plan for Why and How to Unlock
the Potential of the OECD Guidelines.”1 The briefing reflects on the continued
importance of the Guidelines, while recognizing the constraints that need to be addressed
by adhering governments in order to improve the reach and effectiveness of the
instrument. Ten action points were recommended to keep the Guidelines remaining as an
authoritative tool for responsible business conduct.
TUAC and OECD Watch also launched a 40-day count up campaign via Twitter to
help increase awareness over the Guidelines amongst policy-makers and the general
public. The #StepItUp campaign recognized the 40th Anniversary of Guidelines by
launching a tweet a day with messages for governments to step up measures to ensure that
the Guidelines fulfill their potential to defend communities’ and workers' rights.2
In order to remind the G7 Leaders and OECD Ministers of their June 2015 Leaders
Declaration promise to take steps to strengthen NCP performance and lead by example as
part of commitments made to support responsible business conduct, including in global
supply chains, OECD Watch sent a letter3 in August to G7 Leaders requesting that they
back their expressed commitments with immediate actions. The letter recommended that
the G7 Leaders seek revision of the OECD Guidelines’ Procedural Guidance for NCPs in
order to improve the performance and effectiveness of the NCP system, while also
ensuring sufficient resources be allocated to their NCPs and that material consequences
be encouraged for companies found to be non-compliant with the Guidelines.
To help measure NCP performance and create pressure for positive change, TUAC
and OECD Watch initiated two consultation processes with NCPs in 2016 over its draft
NCP Performance Index4, which covers a range of process and outcome indicators. The
input that was provided by NCPs and OECD adhering governments will be incorporated
into the final index that will be launched in 2017.
OECD Watch continues to support communities and civil society groups to use the
Guidelines by filing Specific Instance complaints with NCPs. In 2016, we provided
support to civil society groups in their complaints against Atradius Dutch State Business,
Heineken N.V., Nycomb Synergetics Development AB, Suzuki Motor Corporation,
amongst others.

ANNEX 10. STATEMENTS BY INSTITUTIONAL STAKEHOLDERS

In 2016, OECD Watch participated in the Italian5 and Swiss6 NCPs Peer Reviews
providing concrete recommendations in order to increase stakeholder confidence and
generate more positive outcomes for individuals, civil society groups and trade unions
who use the NCP system. While OECD Watch applauds the NCPs who have already
undergone, or have committed to undergo, the peer review process, we continue to
believe that peer reviews should be made mandatory and carried out regularly in order for
the NCP system to have the information necessary to meet functional equivalence and
remain relevant in the changing landscape of corporate accountability.
OECD Watch members have continued to remain active in the OECD’s Proactive
Agenda by providing input into the draft reports on G eneral
Due
Diligence
for
Responsible Business Conduct and the Guidance on Responsible Business Conduct for
Institutional investors. It is our hope that these guidance documents will continue to be
promoted by the OECD and play an important role in helping companies understand and
navigate through their due diligence requirements, while also upholding the highest
responsible business conduct and human rights standards.

Trade Union Advisory Committee (TUAC)
In 2016, the Trade Union Advisory Committee to the OECD (TUAC), working with
its affiliates and trade union partners, continued to work towards achieving the effective
implementation of the OECD Guidelines through well-resourced and accountable
National Contact Points (NCPs). Trade unions have also supported the OECD in its
efforts to establish a common understanding of due diligence through the development of
authoritative guidance.
In a landmark year, TUAC and OECD Watch marked the 40th anniversary of the
Guidelines by conducting a 40-day Twitter ‘Count-up’ in which they called on
governments and the OECD to “Step it Up”, so that the Guidelines fulfil their potential to
defend the rights of communities and workers. TUAC also participated in a number of
40th Anniversary promotional events, organised by the Austrian, Hungarian and Mexican
NCPs, as well as the OECD.
As part of their activities to strengthen NCPs, TUAC and OECD published the first
Draft of their NCP Performance Index. The Index ranks NCP performance in five
categories: institutional arrangements, promotional activities, NCP procedures, peer
learning; and case outcomes. TUAC and OECD held consultations with their
members/affiliates/partners, as well as with governments, in order to develop a final
methodology that is fair and robust, whilst delivering an Index that serves as a driver for
change. The Index will be published in 2017.
On due diligence, TUAC served on two OECD sectoral Advisory Groups – Garments
and Footwear, and the Financial Sector – alongside its trade union partners the
International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC), IndustriALL and UNI Global Union. It
also provided input to the ongoing development of the OECD General Due Diligence
Guidance. In May 2016, TUAC represented trade unions at the launch of the OECD Due

Diligence Guidance for Meaningful Stakeholder Engagement in the Extractive Sector. In
the same month, it co-organised with the ITUC a workshop on Due Diligence, for trade
unionists ahead of the 2016 International Labour Conference on Global Supply Chains.
TUAC applauds those NCPs that signed up for country peer review in 2016 and
welcomes the role played by the OECD NCP Coordination Unit. TUAC, together with its
Italian and Swiss affiliates, attended the peer reviews of Italy and Switzerland, which
were held in September and November respectively.
TUAC was also involved in a number of promotional and capacity-building activities.
In June 2016, trade unions were well represented at the OECD Global Forum on
Responsible Business Conduct, speaking in sessions on trafficking and modern slavery,
due diligence in the textiles and financial sectors, and the NCPs. Throughout the year,
TUAC provided training in a number of trade union events: Buenos Aires, regional
meeting of Building and Woodworkers International (BWI); Istanbul, metal sector
workers (FNV and BIRLESKIK METAL-IS); Florence, joint meeting of the three Italian
trade union confederations, the Confédération Générale Italienne du Travail (CGIL),
Confédération Italienne des Syndicats des Travailleurs (CISL), and Union Italienne du
Travail (UIL), which was also attended by the Italian NCP; Rotterdam, meeting of the
Shell Global Union Network (FNV and IndustriALL); and Nepal, two regional meetings
held in October and November for trade unionists from South Asia (TUAC,ACTRAV
and FES).
TUAC published its Trade Union Guide to the OECD Guidelines in Hindi and
Bengali. The Guide is now available in fourteen languages. TUAC also continued its
work in supporting trade unionists submitting specific instances under the OECD
Guidelines.
