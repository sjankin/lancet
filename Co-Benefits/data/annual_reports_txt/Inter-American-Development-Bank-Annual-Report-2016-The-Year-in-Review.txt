  Excludes guarantees issued under the Trade Facilitation Program and non-sovereign-guaranteed loan participations, and exposure and exchange
  agreements.
b
  “Total Equity” is defined as Paid-in capital stock, net of Capital subscriptions receivable, less Receivable from members, plus Retained earnings minus
  borrowing countries’ local currency cash balances (non-GAAP measure).
c
  Includes loans outstanding and guarantee exposure.
d
   Effective in 2015, the Total Equity used to compute the Total Equity-to-loans ratio no longer excludes the cumulative effects of Net fair value
  adjustments on non-trading portfolios and foreign currency transactions, and does not add back the Allowance for loan and guarantee losses. Prior
  year ratios were recalculated to conform with the new definition.

         A PARTNER FOR

Latin America and the Caribbean
-----------------------Page 3 End-----------------------

     The IDB Group is composed of the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), the Inter-
     American Investment Corporation (IIC) and the Multilateral Investment Fund (MIF),
     a fund administered by the IDB. The IDB, the oldest and largest regional multilateral
     development bank, is the main source of multilateral financing for economic, social, and
     institutional development in Latin America and the Caribbean.
        The mission of the IIC is to promote the economic development of Latin America and
     the Caribbean through the private sector. As part of its mission, the IIC supports the
     private sector and state-owned enterprises through financing in the form of loans, equity
     investments, and guarantees. The IIC also partners with clients to provide advisory and
     training services.
        The MIF is the innovation lab for the IDB Group. It conducts high-risk experiments
     to test new models for engaging and inspiring the private sector to solve economic
     development problems in Latin America and the Caribbean.
        The IDB obtains its own financial resources from its 48 member countries, borrowings
     on the financial markets and trust funds that it administers, and through cofinancing
     ventures.


     The IDB’s debt rating is Triple-A, the highest available. The IDB is headquartered in
     Washington, D.C. and has Country Offices in all 26 of its member countries in Latin
     America and the Caribbean, as well as in Madrid and Tokyo. By the end of 2016, the IDB
     had approved more than $260 billion in loans and guarantees, to finance projects with
     investments totaling nearly $539 billion, as well as $6.8 billion in grants.

                                                            MESSAGE
                                                               FROM
                                                       THE PRESIDENT
In 2016, many of the fundamental assumptions underlying the global economic
order were challenged in ways few had anticipated. Nor are the consequences
of those challenges clear as yet.
   But even in these uncertain times, the development priorities of Latin Amer-
ican and Caribbean nations remain largely unchanged. We must boost our
productivity and stimulate innovation, two factors that largely explain that gap
separating us from the industrialized world. We have to improve our public
health and education systems, whose poor quality translates into stark dispar-
ities in opportunities and outcomes within our own societies. And we have to
build the infrastructure and tear down the barriers that have so long prevented
us from becoming a regional trade powerhouse.
   In each and every one of those goals, Latin America and the Caribbean have
an ally in the Inter-American Development Bank. In line with the IDB’s Long-
Term Financial Plan, in 2016 we approved a program of 86 sovereign-guaranteed
projects totaling $9.3 billion. Disbursements from the IDB exceeded $8.7 billion,
with a positive net flow to the region.
   Besides supplying loans, guarantees and grants, we also continued to
create and disseminate knowledge on topics crucial for our countries’ develop-
ment. Last year that work resulted in hundreds of contributions, ranging from
peer-reviewed publications and databases to conferences and training MOOCs
that regularly attract tens of thousands of participants.
   These numbers confirm us as a leading source of long-term development
financing and expertise for the region. We are also better able to fulfill that role
thanks to the integration of the resources of the Fund for Special Operations
into our Ordinary Capital, which bolstered our lending capacity.
   While volume is an important metric, customer satisfaction is also para-
mount. Our external feedback surveys tell us there is close to 90 percent client
satisfaction with our services. Our public sector partners are especially pleased
with our technical expertise and our grasp of their national priorities. They also
say they want us to work more on sharing experiences with other countries as
well as on bringing the private sector and civil society to the table.




                                                                         IDB ANNUAL REPORT 2016   1
-----------------------Page 7 End-----------------------

         The Bank made strides in two important fields during the year: transpar-
      ency and gender equality. In Publish What You Fund’s 2016 Aid Transparency
      Index, the Bank scored 85.6 out of 100, placing in the highest performance
      category and improving by almost 29 points since 2013. We reached another
      significant institutional milestone this year when the IDB obtained the EDGE
      (Economic Dividend through Gender Equity) certification. This independent as-
      sessment measured us in terms of equal pay for equivalent work; recruitment
      and promotion, leadership development, training and mentoring; flexible work
      arrangements and corporate culture. I am proud that the IDB was the world’s
      first regional development bank to be EDGE certified.
         Given the circumstances the world will face in 2017, we can expect our abil-
      ity to serve as the region’s premier development partner to be put to the test,
      not just as a source of reasonably priced, long-term financing, but also as a
      trusted disseminator of knowledge. But that is our purpose: to help our coun-
      tries overcome the obstacles to lasting prosperity and a better quality of life for
      the 600 million people in Latin America and the Caribbean.
         We look forward to the challenge, bolstered by an optimism based on what
      we have achieved over nearly six decades of collective efforts.

Peru: In the country’s small cities, or municipios, coverage rates for drinking water and
sanitation a decade ago averaged 62 and 30 percent, respectively, well below the national
and regional rates. By the middle of 2016, in communities such as Tincopalca, in the
southeastern province of Puno, over 30,000 homes had obtained access to water for the
first time, thanks to the support of the Spanish Cooperation Fund for Water and Sanitation
in Latin America and the Caribbean. Photo: Ministry of Housing, Construction and Sanitation.
