 Officers 2017:

                  Chair          Ambassador Vince Henderson, Permanent Representative of Dominica
January–June
                                 Ambassador Gedeón Santos, Permanent Representative of the
                  Vice Chair
                                 Dominican Republic

                                 Ambassador Marco Vinicio Albuja Martínez, Permanent Representative
                  Chair
                                 of Ecuador
July–December
                  Vice Chair     Ambassador Ana Rosa Valdivieso, Permanent Representative of Peru.


 In January 2017, the Inter-American Council for Integral Development (CIDI) confirmed Ms. Kim Osborne
 as the Executive Secretary for Integral Development (SEDI), pursuant to Articles 117 and 120 of the OAS
 Charter; and in a meeting on May 2, 2017, the Board of Directors of the Inter-American Agency for
 Cooperation and Development (IACD) agreed to accept her appointment as the Director General of the
 IACD, in accordance with Article 12 of the Statute of the IACD.

 In compliance with the mandates to strengthen CIDI and its subsidiary bodies—especially the mandates
 aimed at simplifying and modernizing sector processes with the goal of enhancing substantive policy
 dialogue and aligning it with the Strategic Vision of the Organization—one of CIDI’s main tasks during the
 year was to discuss, adopt, and launch implementation of the triennial ministerial cycle and a series of
 guidelines for preparing and following the agreements reached in those meetings.

 CIDI also launched discussions toward finding solutions to ensuring the sustainability of OAS scholarship
 and training programs. As part of this process, and in order to lift the pause established toward the end
 of 2016 in the award of new graduate scholarships, CIDI adopted a series of recommendations to guide
 implementation of the 2018 scholarship program cycle.

 In the framework of CIDI, the member states had an opportunity to exchange experiences and lessons
 learned from the implementation of areas of intervention 1 and 2 of the Plan of Action of the Social
 Charter of the Americas (Labor and Social Protection, respectively), as well as from implementation of
 the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). As a result
 of this meeting, the SEDI adopted the SDG statistical reporting platform presented by the United States
 and shared it over CooperaNet with five member states.

 Also, as part of its thematic meetings, the CIDI analyzed the links between energy and competitiveness,
 and between sustainable cities, risk management, and resilience. The objective was for States to share
 their experiences by strengthening ties through high-level meetings in the CIDI and the work pursued by
 SEDI.

 The following sectoral meetings were held within the framework of CIDI:

 o       Ninth Inter-American Meeting of Ministers of Education (Nassau, The Bahamas), where the
         Declaration of the Bahamas and the Inter-American Educational Agenda (IEA)
-----------------------Page 8 End-----------------------

                                                -6-


       (CIDI/RME/DEC. 1/17 and CIDI/RME/doc.6/17) were adopted, with the aim of strengthening
       cooperation and coordinating with other bodies to guarantee a quality, inclusive, and equitable
       education, as well as supporting opportunities for ongoing lifelong learning. In support of the
       IEA, the Development Cooperation Fund (DCF/OAS) approved US$1.5 million in seed funding
       that will be used in 2018 to fund projects in 19 member states. The delegation of Antigua and
       Barbuda offered to host the next meeting in 2019.

o      Fifth Meeting of Ministers and High Authorities of Science and Technology (Medellín, Colombia),
       which adopted the Declaration of Medellín “Science, Technology, and Innovation as Pillars of
       Transformation in the Americas” (CIDI/REMCYT-V/DEC. 1/17 rev. 1). The declaration
       recommends incorporating transformative technologies in the development of innovative
       policies and regional collaboration programs that help to enhance knowledge and the creativity
       and problem-solving needed for the jobs of the future and Industry 4.0.

o      Twentieth Inter-American Conference of Ministers of Labor (IACML) (Bridgetown, Barbados),
       which adopted the Declaration and Plan of Action of Bridgetown “Building on our Achievements
       and Advancing towards Social Justice, Decent Work, and Sustainable Development in the
       Americas” (CIDI/TRABAJO/DEC. 1/17 rev. 1 and CIDI/TRABAJO/doc.7/17 rev. 2), which, among
       other things, seek to support national and regional efforts to improve coordination between
       education and labor policies, address the challenges of the future of work, strengthen social
       dialogue, support sustainable enterprises, and advance toward gender equality and full
       guarantee of labor rights and opportunities for vulnerable populations.

CIDI made progress in its day-to-day activities through the Committee on Partnership for Development
Policies, the Committee on Migration Issues (CAM), the Working Group to Analyze the OAS Scholarship
and Training Programs, and the Working Group to Strengthen CIDI, which completed its work in June
2017.

Assembly, are available on its web page: www.oas.org/en/cidi

2. GENERAL SECRETARIAT

Chapter XVI of the Charter describes the functions and attributes of the General Secretariat, the OAS’
central and permanent organ headquartered in Washington, D.C. Elected by the General Assembly, the
Secretary General directs the General Secretariat, serves as its legal representative and participates in all
meetings of the Organization with voice but without vote. It is the Secretary General’s responsibility to
establish whatever offices he deems necessary within the General Secretariat, to determine the number
of staff members, appoint them, and regulate their duties and functions.

2.1 OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY GENERAL

Summary of the accomplishments of the Office of the Secretary General

Office of the Secretary General

During 2017, Secretary General Luis Almagro redoubled his efforts to defend and promote the principles
and values of the Charter of the Organization of American States, of the Inter-American Democratic
Charter, and of the inter-American human rights system throughout the region, along with his efforts to
implement his vision for securing more rights for more people in the Americas.

In addition to guiding the Organization’s thematic and administrative responsibilities, the Secretary
General paid particular attention to the various especially difficult situations emerging in several
member states. His efforts were directed mainly at restoring democracy in Venezuela, which is in the
middle of a political, economic, and humanitarian crisis.

In addition to meetings with political leaders, civil society organizations, and the families of the victims of
human rights abuses, the Secretary General did not fail to alert the international community to the
worsening of the crisis in Venezuela, where, in addition to a rupture in the constitutional order, 2017
saw a complete breakdown of democracy.

On July 19, 2017, the Secretary General submitted his third report on the situation of Venezuela. In it, he
broadly described the government’s repeated anti-constitutional attempts to cling to power by denying
Venezuelans their civil, political, and human rights, even to the point to attacking their very lives. He
called for the suspension of the National Constituent Assembly; the release of all political prisoners;
immediate free and fair elections as the crisis’ only exit; the opening of a humanitarian channel to
alleviate suffering resulting from a lack of food and medicine; and a return to constitutional order with
regard to the separation of powers among the various branches of government.

On September 25, 2017, the Secretary General submitted his fourth report on Venezuela. In it, he
reviewed how democracy had been totally eliminated in the country with the installation of an
illegitimate Constitutional Assembly on July 30, 2017. The Secretary General described how the process
that led to the installation of a Constitutional Assembly was a violation of the Constitutional provision on
the universality of the vote. He also stated that the process had from the beginning been plagued by
multiple irregularities, as well as by violence and attacks on the freedoms of citizens. He described the
violation of human rights and basic freedoms in Venezuela, the absence of the rule of law, and the
constant attacks on political parties and organizations. He stated that the branches of government were
no longer separate or independent, adding that as of July 30, the country had ceased to hold regular,
free, and clean elections with a secret and universal ballot as an expression of the People's sovereignty.

The establishment of the Constitutional Assembly represented "a total break with democratic order" in
Venezuela.

For the general elections held in Honduras on November 26, 2017, the OAS deployed an Electoral
Observation Mission headed by the former president of Bolivia, Jorge Tuto Quiroga. The Mission, which
remained in the country from October 30 to December 19, 2017, performed a comprehensive analysis of
the electoral process’s organization and technology, campaign financing, and electoral justice, as well as
the political participation of women. The Mission maintained a presence after the vote, using new tools
and working with international experts to conduct the best observation possible. The Commission's Final
Report was delivered on December 24, 2017, to the Ambassador of Honduras before the OAS and
remitted to the Permanent Council of the Organization, which circulated among the member states. The
Secretary General expressed his firm intention to work with Honduras on three levels—executive,
legislative, and municipal—in the framework of current cooperation agreements, institution building,
and electoral reform to ensure democratic, just, and supportive coexistence.

The General Secretariat deployed an Electoral Observation Mission (EOM/OAS) for the municipal
elections in Nicaragua on November 5, 2017. In its final report, the Mission made a series of
recommendations regarding the election’s organization and technology, voter rolls, electoral
institutions, electoral justice, political parties, political/election financing, and political inclusion. The
Mission emphasized that Nicaragua would benefit from comprehensive electoral reform and needed a
permanent legal administrative framework to gain the trust of political groups and the citizenry and
ensure security. The recommendations of the EOM/OAS were recognized and accepted publicly by
President Commander Daniel Ortega, which the General Secretariat shall take into account. Likewise, in
the framework of the Roundtable and Constructive Exchange, the GS/OAS and the Government of
Nicaragua are working on cooperating and monitoring implementation of the mission’s
recommendations. In this sense, the mechanism of constructive dialogue between the Government of
Nicaragua and the General Secretariat of the OAS has initiated conversations toward moving forward in
the country's institutional and democratic strengthening, with a program to last through 2020.

In 2017, the General Secretariat continued working to provide political support to resolve the territorial,
maritime, and insular dispute between Guatemala and Belize. Regarding the political work, 17 political
meetings were held with the most senior government and military officials to move forward in the
organization of popular consultations in each country and on coordination on security issues in the area.
On March 15 and 16, the Secretary General visited Belize and Guatemala, where he met with the foreign
ministers of both countries to discuss the process and the OAS’s support for it, as well as to see first-
hand the work of the OAS Office in the Adjacency Zone. Based on these meetings, the General
Secretariat recommended measures to contribute to facilitating the process and presented specific
mechanisms or processes to prevent or resolve specific problems or incidents in the area, as well as to
monitor implementation and execution of the confidence-building measures.

In recognition of his work to defend democracy and human rights, the Secretary General received
several awards in 2017, including the following:

               The Oswaldo Payá Prize, which he should have accepted from Rosa María Payá, Director
                of the Red Latinoamericana de Jóvenes por la Democracia on February 22 in Havana,
                Cuba. However, this was not possible because the Cuban government itself prevented
                him from traveling to Cuba to accept the award.
               The Rómulo Betancourt Order of Venezuelan Exile, which he accepted in Doral, Florida,
                on April 13 from the organization Venezolanos Perseguidos Políticos en el Exilio.

               An award during the XIV Latin American Political Consulting and Governance Summit on

                of democracy and liberty on the continent.
               The Freedom Award from Freedom House, which he received on April 27 in recognition
                of his work on behalf of Venezuelan political prisoners.
               The 2017 Charles T. Manatt Democracy Award, received on October 2 from the
                International Foundation for Electoral Systems.
               The Francisco de Miranda Award, received on October 27 for his work defending
                freedom in the region.
               The Press Freedom Grand Prize from the Inter-American Press Association, received on
                October 28. The president of the IAPA, Matt Sanders, said Mr. Almagro received the
                Prize “for his invaluable defense and promotion of freedom of expression and of the
                press as the very essence of democracy, as is recognized by the Inter-American
                Democratic Charter.”
               The World Peace Prize from the World Jurist Association, received on October 31.
               Mr. Almagro was also awarded an honorary doctorate from the Universidad de San
                Martín de Porres, Lima, Peru, on December 7, 2017, for his work to revitalize the OAS,
                his fight for democracy, and his flagship policy: More rights for more people.

o       The Office of Protocol organized ceremonies and protocolary meetings to mark Pan American
        Day, the anniversary of the birth of Simón Bolívar, and the Discovery of America - Encounter of

        observer countries. Receptions were organized to bid farewell to the Ambassadors from The
        Bahamas, Belize, Haiti, and Mexico. Ceremonies to change the Chair of the PC and the Chair of
        the CIDI were coordinated. Letters offering congratulations for their national day were prepared
        and sent to the permanent representatives and permanent observers, as well as heads of state
        and government. This practice was discontinued starting in January 2018.

o       Under the coordination of the Office of Protocol a program of four “Country Weeks” were held,
        in which member states and observers are allocated a week in which to stage cultural and/or
        academic events. Ceremonies to mark the signing, deposit, or ratification of protocols and other
        agreements and the presentation of busts, awards, or floral arrangements between the
        Organization and member states or other entities were organized–some 54 ceremonies in all.

o       During the General Assembly in Mexico, coordination services were provided for 119 bilateral
        meetings. Breakfasts were organized with the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) and the Central
        American Integration System (SICA). Also, a donation ceremony was organized with the
        Organization of Women of the Americas (OWA)—the women of the OAS—and the Secretary
        General.

o       Use of the Main Building involves drawing up written contracts between the Organization and
        users, coordinating the logistical support the OAS provides for events, and following up on user
        payments. Around 350 meeting room reservations in the main building were made through the

    Office of Protocol. In 2017, 92 events—receptions, luncheons, dinners, and conferences—were
    held. The Office of Protocol collaborated closely on organization of the Food Festival of the
    Americas organized by the OWA, an organization to which it provided support throughout the
    year. Additionally, a reception in the residence of the Assistant Secretary General was organized
    and coordinated.

o   The Office of Protocol reviewed and keyed some 2,691 applications by the permanent missions
    and their staff into the “e-gov.” system set up by the Department of State of the United States
    for submission of applications. These include accreditations and termination of functions,
    changes to and renewals of visas, extensions of stay, work permits and work permit renewals,
    import and procurement of tax-exempt items, granting of work permits for dependents,
    obtaining and renewing tax exemption cards and driver's licenses, and requests regarding the
    registration, registration renewal, insurance verification, sale, or export of vehicles. Letters were
    sent to U.S. consuls requesting visas abroad for staff, along with other matters related to the
    permanent missions. Visas were obtained for diplomats, administrative staff of the missions,
    domestic staff, and senior OAS staff, and 630 letters were written to obtain driving licenses for
    OAS staff and the non-diplomatic staff of the permanent missions. The Office processed 27
    accreditations for the Secretary General and senior OAS staff to attend United Nations meetings.
    The Office served as liaison with the State Department Escort Service and with airlines to arrange
    for the Secretary General’s travel within the United States, submitting 51 petitions.

o   The Office of Protocol kept the Directory of Missions, Heads of State/Government and Senior
    Government Officials, OAS Organs and Affiliated Entities updated and published on the OAS
    intranet. It also maintained a monthly calendar of activities in the main building and published a
    diplomatic bulletin every two weeks.

o   Verbal messages were sent to the missions and the Department of State to inform them of
    procedures and requirements related to accreditations, vehicles, use of the building, and
    congratulations on national days, as well as invitations on behalf of the member countries to
    official and cultural events.

2.2 OFFICE OF THE ASSISTANT SECRETARY GENERAL (ASG)

Summary of the accomplishments of the Office of the Assistant Secretary General

The Office of the Assistant Secretary General has led several activities toward implementing the Plan of
Action for the Decade for Persons of African Descent in the Americas (2016-2025), which provides a
framework for the OAS to implement policies, programs, and projects to recognize and promote the
rights of persons of African descent in the Americas. These activities were also carried out in recognition
of Black History Month in the United States and in partnership with several permanent and observer
missions, nongovernmental organizations, and private sector entities.

Results obtained by the Office of the Assistant Secretary General

o       We held an event titled "Influencia de la cultura Afro en las Américas” (the influence of African
        culture on the Americas) on February 23, 2017. The event emphasized the influence of African
        culture on music, food, art, and religion throughout the Hemisphere. The presentations focused
        on how African culture contributed to the cultural economy of many countries in the Western
        Hemisphere. Also, the individuals who had received a DNA test kit the previous year were invited
        to share their results. The commemorative activities culminated with the inauguration of an art
        exhibit on African life and culture in the Americas, which remained open to the public in the
        Marcus Garvey Room from February 20 to February 28. Lastly, at the reception to close the
        event, a presentation was made of musical art inspired by the African culture, which included
        dance, Garifuna drummers, and soca music played on steel drums.

o   In response to a request made by member states for the OAS website to highlight the significant
    achievements and contributions of persons of African descent in the Americas, in February 2017
    and in cooperation with the OAS Department of Press and Communications, we invited member
    states to submit a maximum of three profiles per country of individuals of historical note who
    stood out for their national or regional contribution to art, culture, sport, politics, human rights,
    and science, or who—through their courage or hard work—contributed to building their nations.
    A total of 16 profiles were received. They were published on the homepage of the
    OAS website. Available online, the Decade for People of African Descent:
    http://www.oas.org/en/media_center/the-decade-for-people-of-african-descent.asp

o   On March 2, 2018, we conducted a private visit to the National Museum of African American
    History and Culture for permanent representatives, permanent observers, and senior officials of
    the OAS. A total of 41 participants attended, including the ASG, permanent representatives from
    18 member states, and representatives from five observer states. Since then, several requests
    have been received from member states for the Office of the ASG to organize more visits and
    extend the invitation to more delegates and staff of the general secretary. The Office of the ASG
    proposes forming a permanent relationship with the National Museum of African
    American History and Culture and making the visit an annual event on the OAS calendar.

o   In compliance with the Resolution of the GA on the International Decade for People of African
    Descent to observe March 25 as the International Day of Remembrance for the Victims of
    Slavery and the Transatlantic Slave Trade, we worked with the Secretariat for Access to Rights
    and Equity (SARE) to organize a special session of the PC. The meeting was held on March 29 on
    the subject “Remember Slavery: Recognizing the Legacy and Contributions of People of African
    Descent in the Americas,” and it included presentations from four subregions. Available online:

o   In collaboration with the United Nation's Remember Slavery program, we organized the
    premiere screening of the film “Familiar Faces/Unexpected Places: A Global African Diaspora,”
    which explores the legacy and contributions of people of African descent. The event was held in
    the Hall of the Americas and was followed by a roundtable on the situation of persons of African
    descent, moderated by the Secretary for Access to Rights and Equity of the OAS, Mauricio Rands,
    and comprised of panelists from the National Museum of African American History and Culture,
    the United Nations, and the Department of Social Inclusion of the OAS. Parallel to this, a
    companion exhibit produced by the United Nations entitled "Remember Slavery: Recognition,
    Justice and Development” was presented in the Hall of Heroes of the OAS. Available online:

o      In September 2016, we collaborated with regional organizations and international financial
       institutions to hold a meeting in OAS headquarters1 to look at ways to improve cooperation, find
       synergies, and complement one another in the work programs with a view to enhancing
       collaboration, avoiding overlap, and maximizing impact.

o      Following the inaugural meeting, on January 23, 2017, the participants agreed on a Declaration
       of Intent which formalized their commitment and identified five common work areas: (i) social
       inclusion, (ii) implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals, (iii) empowerment of
       vulnerable populations, (iv) generation of economic opportunities, and (v) education. During the
       meeting, the organizations agreed to publish the declaration on their websites and social media
       platforms. It was also decided to conduct a mapping of the work of each organization on social
       inclusion in order to identify synergies and complementarity.

o      On September 8, 2017, we held a teleconference in which the results of the mapping activity
       were presented, as compiled by the Office of the ASG. During the meeting, officials from the
       World Bank made a presentation on its Caribbean Regional Oceanscape Program: Think Blue U,
       one of its blue economy initiatives that seeks to accelerate access to education on oceans
       through collaborative methods, strategic partnerships, and innovative approaches (including
       virtual learning). The initiative, which will be implemented in the Eastern Caribbean, has been
       supported by the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS) and has also been shared with
       the Commonwealth Secretariat.

o      We coordinated the activities to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the signing of the OAS
       Charter, the planning for which began in August 2017. An internal planning committee was
       established that proposed limiting the main events at headquarters to two or three
       presentations—due to budgetary limits—photo galleries of historic documents, and images of
       the achievements of member states, coordinated by the Columbus Memorial Library, as well as
       exhibitions coordinated with the Art Museum of the Americas.

       The committee's other recommendations included the publication of lectures by former
       presidents and prime ministers from around the region, as well as from former secretary
       generals and assistant secretary generals of the OAS. They also proposed scheduling a special
       meeting of the Permanent Council to officially launch the commemorative year, which would
       include presentations by PAHO, IDB, IICA, and UN officials. It additionally proposed inviting
       member states to issue commemorative stamps in their countries and hold special events to
       celebrate the anniversary throughout the Americas. The commemorative year would take place
       from April 2018 to March 2019 with the theme “OAS: 70 years working for citizens of the
       Americas - Peace, democracy, development, and rights for all”

o      Model General Assembly of the OAS (MOAS)

In 2017, the Model General Assembly of the OAS (MOAS)—directed toward the youth of the
Hemisphere—saw participation from 1,013 students and 148 teachers from both universities and high
schools and from the different member countries of the Organization. Specifically, three Model General
Assemblies were held:

o      Washington Model OAS (WMOAS): This MOAS for English-speaking students from the
       universities of the hemisphere that took place April 10-14 at OAS headquarters in Washington
       was successfully organized by the Institute for Diplomatic Dialogue in the Americas (IDDA) and
       sponsored by the GS/OAS.

2.2.1Office of the Secretariat to the General Assembly, the Meeting of Consultation, the Permanent
Council, and Subsidiary Organs

The Secretariats of the General Assembly (GA), the Meeting of Consultation, the Permanent Council (PC),
and the Subsidiary Organs (OSAG), answering to the Assistant Secretary General, have principal functions
that include advising, orienting, and providing ongoing support to the elected officers of the political
bodies in their review of priority matters of interest within their spheres of competence.

2.2.2 Department of Conferences and Meetings Management (DCMM)

Summary of the accomplishments of the DCMM

Through the DCMM, we managed a total of 910 meetings in 2017. The DCMM provided the services
needed for 181 meetings of the CP, its committees, and working group; 22 meetings of the CIDI; and for
the forty-seventh regular session of the GA, in Mexico, and the fifty-second special session of the GA; the
Twenty-ninth Meeting of Consultation of the Ministers of Foreign Affairs; and the other meetings and
conferences conducted under the auspices of the four pillars of the Organization.

Results obtained by the DCMM

o       We provided assistance to the host countries and offered the conference services needed to
        hold seven ministerial meetings in 2017: Ninth Inter-American Meeting of Ministers of
        Education – Bahamas; Seventeenth Regular Session of the Inter-American Committee against
        Terrorism (CICTE) – Panama; Sixth Meeting of Ministers Responsible for Public Security in the
        Americas – Honduras; Summit Implementation Review Group (SIRG) – Peru; Fifth Meeting of
        Ministers and High Authorities of Science and Technology of the CIDI – Colombia; Fourth
        Meeting of the Inter-American Committee on Social Development (CIDES) – Washington, D.C.;
        Twentieth Inter-American Conference of Ministers of Labor – Barbados.

o       We provided constant technical support to 10 conference and meeting rooms that the DCMM
        manages at headquarters, and a plan was prepared and coordinated for overhauling the
        equipment in the Guerrero Room. Also, a training plan was designed for technical staff to
        optimize and ensure effective technical management of OAS meetings.

o       In 2017, we began working with DOITS to create a new system for scheduling meetings to
        replace the current “Oascal.” This system meets the needs of users and will ensure greater
        efficiency in the allocation of resources and services for meetings. Likewise, work began on
        creating a new intelligent document management system for electronic distribution of
        documents.

o       We provided document printing and distribution services for the different meetings held in 2017
        and responded to requests from the areas of the General Secretariat for graphic and digital
        design, which increased by 25% in 2017. We printed a total of 20,500 copies of around 176
        publications, as well as 14,500 copies of around 723 documents needed for meetings held both
        inside and outside headquarters. In March 2017, we launched the DCMM’s quarterly newsletter,
        the purpose of which is to provide information on the services that the department provides. We
        also designed manuals for the DCMM and other publications of the Office of the Assistant
        Secretary General.

                                                 - 16 -



o      We provided simultaneous interpretation in Spanish, French, English, and Portuguese during
       approximately 405 meetings of the bodies, offices, and entities of the Organization, both at and
       away from headquarters, through the Language Section. By providing these services internally,
       we saved approximately US$15,400 for the OAS. Regarding document translation, we translated
       close to 7.8 million words in the Organization’s four official languages—an increase of around 1.8
       million words compared to 2016. We expanded the list of external translators and converted it
       into a modern database. This will significantly increase the efficiency of the outsourcing process.

o      The section’s staff received training on the new functions of the SDL Trados computer-assisted
       translation software, which was updated in September. The update will enable further
       improvements to productivity and efficiency. Also, the OAS Style Manual was published in
       French, and an updated guide for test graders was published as well. Three training sessions
       were also conducted on the IDMS tool, training nine officials from different areas of the General
       Secretariat.

2.2.3 Coordinating Office for the Offices and Units of the General Secretariat in the Member States
Summary of the accomplishments of the Coordinating Office

We continued proactively with measures to oversee the operations of national offices with the objective
of increasing their efficiency. In this regard, we continued working to establish policies covering all
budgetary and operational matters and aimed at project facilitation, implementation, and monitoring, as
well as at strengthening mechanisms for political dialogue and providing support to technical
cooperation programs.

Results obtained by the Coordinating Office

o      We work together with national offices to address the recommendations of the Office of the
       Inspector General and proceed to implement them.
o      We make effective use of available technology to facilitate the individualized training of staff at
       national offices on the Organization's financial tools and on updates to the financial
       management policies that all the offices must follow.
o      In order to continue enriching the skills acquired through the training sessions, we update
       existing interactive tools and expand their accessibility. Applications like the National Office
       Collaborative Space (NOCS) facilitate day-to-day communication between the Coordinating
       Office and the national offices. These types of tools provide a shared space for publishing
-----------------------Page 19 End-----------------------

                                              - 17 -


    budgetary and financial information, while at the same time enabling users to regularly monitor
    reports, inventories, and other relevant information instantaneously, which reduces the time
    and cost of sending them.
o   We schedule regular virtual meetings to increase interaction between the offices of the General
    Secretariat and the national offices. In these meetings, the national offices have been regularly
    updated on the activities and programs being executed in member countries. These types of
    interaction provide space for dialogue and for exchanging ideas, and they ensure the national
    offices are consistently providing support to the different areas in headquarters.
o   We have compiled relevant information on the cooperation the Organization has provided in the
    Americas to post it on the OAS website and for answering requests and meeting the needs of
    member states. This tool will be very useful for disseminating information to the permanent
    missions, local governments, academic institutions, and civil society in general, while at the same
    time highlighting the Organization’s work in member countries.
o   We completed the Procedures Manual for National Offices, which provides easy access to basic
    institutional information and serves as a practical guide to representatives on executing their
    roles and responsibilities. The manual is designed to help improve effectiveness and ensure cost
    savings, serving as a practical and complementary tool for new representatives. The manual will
    be published electronically and updated regularly to reflect changes to policies and/or its other
    aspects.
o   We participated actively in the planning of activities to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the
    OAS.
o   In order to reduce operating costs in the national offices, we have continued the policy of
    sharing space among different areas and/or organizations of the inter-American system. These
    agreements enable cost-sharing, while at the same time strengthening ties between the
    Organization and other entities.
o   We continue to conduct quarterly budgetary reviews with the national offices to ensure the
    most efficient distribution of funds and better expenditure control.

2.3 SECRETARIAT FOR STRENGTHENING DEMOCRACY (SSD)

Summary of the accomplishments of the SSD

The most significant achievements of the Secretariat for Strengthening Democracy in 2017 were as
follows:

We deployed five electoral observation missions in five countries in the region, involving a total of 378
observers (46 percent of them women): The Bahamas, Ecuador, Haiti, Honduras, and Nicaragua. We also
sent an expert mission to Bolivia for the judicial elections. We also sent delegations of electoral experts
to Honduras and Paraguay for the presidential primary elections. In addition, we sent an international
electoral delegation to Curacao. Their analysis covered issues including electoral organization, use of
technology, campaign finance, participation of women, the system of electoral justice, electoral security,
districting, and voting by overseas citizens.

In the area of technical cooperation on electoral matters, of particular note were the comprehensive
auditing of the biometric voter rolls in Bolivia; the international seminar entitled “shared experiences
with voter roll management and transparency;” and the activities of the project Quality Management
Systems – ISO/TS 17582 (Electoral ISO). Regarding the Electoral ISO, we continued leading the ISO 176
Working Group Committee in charge of reviewing and updating this important instrument for certifying
electoral bodies around the world. Under the International Electoral Accreditation Body (IEAB) program,
a platform was designed to accredit certification houses and facilitate contact between them and
electoral bodies seeking certification. Also, the IEAB was given a presence on social media.

We provided support (to countries that have requested it) for strengthening and preserving democratic
institutions and peacefully resolving disputes. The progress made by the Mission to Support the Fight
against Corruption and Impunity in Honduras (MACCIH) is noteworthy, as is the deployment of the
cooperation mission to continue strengthening democratic institutions in Nicaragua. In addition, we
helped strengthen the work of the Mission to Support the Peace Process in Colombia (MAPP/OAS),
support for democratic governance in Haiti, and the implementation of confidence- and security-building
measures between Belize and Guatemala under the auspices of the Fund for Peace and the OAS Office in
the Adjacency Zone.

We helped strengthen cooperation on democracy and peace with other international and regional
organizations, such as the United Nations and European Union. We also helped strengthen crosscutting
efforts toward intra- and inter-institutional coordination on this subject. On electoral matters, we would
highlight the organization of the Twelfth Inter-American Electoral Management Meeting, held in
Colombia, and the Twelfth Meeting of the Signatory Organizations of the Declaration of Principles for
International Election Observation, held at OAS headquarters. As far as the work done with legislatures,
we would highlight our interaction with integration parliaments and parliamentary forums such as the
Central American Parliament, Andean Parliament, Latin American Parliament, ParlAmericas, and
EUROLAT.

o         Electoral accompaniment, for a total of three missions of electoral experts and delegations: one
          to Honduras for the primary elections on March 12, on to Curacao for general elections, one to
          Bolivia for judicial elections on December 3, and one to Paraguay for primary elections that took
          place simultaneously for parties, political movements, and electoral coalitions on December 17.

o         Technical cooperation on electoral matters through a technical cooperation project to conduct a
          comprehensive audit of the biometric voter rolls in Bolivia, we audited the voter rolls in Bolivia
          and provided a series of recommendations for improvements.

          We strengthened relationships with authorities in the region and facilitated horizontal
          cooperation among the region’s electoral authorities. The Twelfth Annual Inter-American
          Electoral Management Meeting was held in Colombia. Representatives of 28 electoral bodies
          participated from 20 countries in the region. During the meeting, the following challenges and
          successful practices were discussed: Mechanisms of direct democracy; citizen education and
          electoral training; the internal democracy of political parties and member registration; and the
          use of social networks by electoral authorities.

          We hosted the Twelfth Meeting of the Signatory Organizations of the Declaration of Principles
          for International Election Observation, where the organizations signatory to the Declaration—
-----------------------Page 22 End-----------------------

                                              - 20 -


    more than 50—met to discuss the challenges faced by electoral observation, as well as strategies
    to improve and harmonize the methodologies used. During the meeting, good practices were
    shared and the new challenges and opportunities facing international electoral observation were
    analyzed. We strengthened the capacity of participant organizations to observe direct
    democracy processes, including on aspects such as electoral justice and the impact of the
    Internet on electoral campaigns. During the meeting, the Permanent Council of the OAS
    provided information on the efforts of the OAS and other organizations signatory to the
    Declaration of Principles to strengthen electoral processes.

    With the launch of the online registry for electoral observers, we strengthened the process of
    applying for the MOEs/OAS, increased the transparency of the process to select international
    observers, and added new observers to the MOEs/OAS.

    With the third edition of online course for electoral observers, we were able to train 122
    participants from the public sector and civil society from 23 countries (20 member states) on the
    theory, techniques, and logistics of the electoral observation missions of the OAS.

o   We conducted five special missions:

    o       Haiti: The mission maintained close contact with the new Haitian government and all
            pertinent actors to promote the OAS mandate and mission; learn about the
            government's priorities; identify ways of collaboration; and design (with support from
            OAS headquarters) a draft support strategy (2017-2022) to improve democratic
            governance in Haiti and promote the country's development.

            The options for cooperation that are currently the subject of conversations/negotiation
            include: (a) supporting efforts toward national dialogue and establishment of a culture
            of dialogue; (b) supporting modernization of the national identification office (ONI;
            (c) Supporting preparation of a national cyber security plan; (d) Supporting the national
            e-government plan; and (e) joint OAS/FUPAD initiatives to strengthen municipal capacity
            and support initiatives to help Haiti’s Great South.

    o       Honduras - Mission to Support the Fight against Corruption and Impunity in Honduras
            (MACCIH): We supported establishment of Honduras’ National Anticorruption System,
            made up of specialized units within the Judicial Branch—the special anticorruption
            jurisdiction, which will try cases and dismantle corruption networks—and the Public
            Ministry—the Special Prosecutor Unit against Impunity and Corruption, which is
            comprised of prosecutors, investigators, and specialists in collecting and analyzing
            financial and criminal information. Both areas will collaborate directly with the Mission.
            The objective of this system is to enable effective coordination between the Mission, the
            Public Ministry, and the judicial branch in order to ensure that those responsible for acts
            of corruption in Honduras are investigated, brought to trial, convicted, and punished
            impartially. Under this model, the Mission began investigating nine high-impact cases of
            corruption.

            We actively collaborated with the Public Ministry in the case of the Honduran Social
            Security Institute (IHSS) by supporting investigations into its director, Mario Zelaya. He
            was convicted and sentenced to 25 years in prison on the first three counts brought
            against him. This is the longest prison sentence for corruption handed down against a
-----------------------Page 23 End-----------------------

                                       - 21 -


    former public official in the history of Honduras. Also, two vice ministers who held
    positions on the IHSS Board of Directors were convicted.

    We provided technical assistance and training to strengthen Honduran institutions,
    including to the following: the Office of the Attorney General of the Nation, to help
    establish a solid policy for the fight against corruption; the Supreme Audit Tribunal, to
    establish integrated investigation teams to jointly investigate cases of illicit enrichment;
    the Institute on Access to Public Information, with training and proposing
    recommendations for reforms and joint investigations in cases of corruption; and the
    National Anticorruption Council, to establish integrated investigation teams to provide
    advisory services, support, and recommendations on joint investigations of corruption
    cases.

    We provided advisory services to advance new laws, including the Financing,
    Transparency, and Supervision of Political Parties in Honduras Act. A bill was proposed to
    establish a legal framework for effective collaboration with the Office of the Public
    Prosecutor ("Effective Collaboration Act"), as was a new Social Security bill, the Public
    Safety Documents Classification Act, and The National Defense Bill. Also, advisory
    services were provided for a bill proposing a new Criminal Code Act.

    The MACCIH-OAS Criminal Justice Observatory worked with Honduran civil society and
    academia to design a matrix for conducting ongoing evaluation of Honduras's criminal
    justice system, including by creating evaluation indicators. The Observatory has also
    conducted "dialogue forums" for exchanging ideas and information on relevant matters
    to improve Honduras's criminal justice system.

    We worked on a regulatory proposal to comply with the Protection of          Human Rights
    Defenders, Journalists, Social Communicators, and Justice Officials          Act, focusing
    specifically on the latter by providing advisory services on designing an    organizational
    framework of special mechanisms for protecting the justice officials         of the Public
    Ministry and the Judicial Branch.

o   Colombia - Mission to Support the Peace Process in Colombia (MAPP): Through this
    mission, we have a presence in 235 municipalities, and we have 16 offices around the
    country. On December 19, 2017, the mandate of the Mission to support the peace
    process in Colombia was extended to December 31, 2021, with the signing of the
    seventh protocol to the agreement between the OAS General Secretariat and the
    Government of Colombia. The Secretary General reiterated the OAS’s commitment to
    supporting the peace policy of the State of Columbia and to providing support through
    the MAPP.

    We helped strengthen and support the peace building policy in the areas most affected
    by the internal armed conflict and where the MAPP/OAS has a presence. Thus, we
    opened a new regional office to expand the coverage of the MAPP/OAS’s work. We also
    supported and monitored the process of implementing the Colombian government’s
    comprehensive reparations policy and participation of victims of the armed conflict, with
    an emphasis on emblematic cases prioritized in different regions in the country. We also
    supported and monitored implementation of mechanisms for coordinating indigenous
    justice, ordinary justice, and transitional justice.

    One of the main concerns of the Mission to Support the Peace Process in Colombia is
    that the territory disputes of illegal actors will directly affect the populations caught in
    the middle of these conflicts and the challenges involved when the State’s peace policies
    reach the areas most affected by the conflict. These dynamics raise the need to monitor
    contexts, conditions, and characteristics of these phenomena of violence in order to
    understand what is taking place in remote areas and take more effective measures to
    address them through targeted, regular, and progressive monitoring, using criteria of
    trustworthiness, timeliness, relevance, and geographical pertinence.

o   Belize/Guatemala – Implementation of confidence-building measures: We worked
    through the Fund for Peace to provide political support to resolve the territorial,
    maritime, and insular dispute between Guatemala and Belize, as well as perform
    technical work through the Office of the SG/OAS in the Adjacency Zone. This leads to
    improved conditions of coexistence for both countries in this area. Regarding the
    political work, we conducted 17 political meetings with the most senior government and
    military officials to move forward in the organization of popular referendums in each
    country and on coordination on security issues in the area. On March 15 and 16, the
    Secretary General of the OAS, Luis Almagro, visited Belize and Guatemala, where he met
    with the foreign ministers of both countries to discuss the process and the OAS’s support
    for it, as well as to see first-hand the work of the OAS Office in the Adjacency Zone.
    Based on these meetings, the Mission recommended measures to contribute to
    facilitating the process and presented specific mechanisms or processes to prevent or
    resolve specific problems or incidents in the area, and to monitor implementation and
    execution of the confidence-building measures. Meetings were also held with
    representatives of the international community to provide information on the status of
    the process and/or receive comments from partners and donors.

    Regarding the technical activities on the ground, we conducted 13 binational meetings
    between the armed forces—at the battalion level—to identify specific problems
    affecting performance of joint security operations in the adjacency zone. These meetings
    are held every three months and coordinated by the Office on the Adjacency Zone to
    assess the security situation there. We also conducted 49 meetings and institutional
    coordination activities with immigration, customs, police forces, NGOs, and educational
    institutions (addressing matters of environmental conservation, human rights, and
    informational presentations on the conflict and the role of the OAS). These included the
    Belize NGO Friends for Conservation and Development and the Guatemalan NGO
    Asociación Balam.

    We also conducted 248 verification activities, eight training sessions in the framework of
    the culture of peace program, and supported 17 humanitarian assistance actions for
    individual families affected by the conflict in the Adjacency Zone.

    We continued working on the campaigns to disseminate information on trust-building
    measures and the ”Special Agreement between Guatemala and Belize to submit the
    territorial claim of Guatemala to the International Court of Justice / Protocol to the
    Special Agreement Between Belize and Guatemala.”

    On December 12, 2017, the Secretary General met with the foreign ministers of Belize
    and Guatemala to identify the Mission’s priorities for 2018. Following the
    recommendation of the Secretary General of the OAS to submit Guatemala’s territorial
    claim before the International Court of Justice, the Government of Guatemala held a
    referendum on the subject on April 15, 2018. Belize has yet to set the date of its
    referendum. We reached out to both campaigns and provided them with information
    prior to the referendums.

    We would emphasize that 17 high-level meetings were held, as well as 13 meetings
    between the Army of Guatemala and the Belize Defence Forces (four meetings of
    operational commanders and nine meetings of battalion commanders). Also, 248
    verification activities were conducted, along with 49 meetings for interagency
    coordination between counterparts. We distributed 1,000 pamphlets on the “Special
    Trust-building Measures” and 1,000 pamphlets on the “Special Agreement between
    Guatemala and Belize to submit the territorial claim of Guatemala to the International
    Court of Justice / Protocol to the Special Agreement Between Belize and Guatemala” as
    part of information campaigns carried out in the communities in the Adjacency Zone to
    build trust. We also conducted eight training sessions (including a workshop on water
    and peace, English and Spanish courses, and a needlepoint workshop), and 17
    humanitarian assistance actions for individual families affected by the conflict in the
    Adjacency Zone.

o   Nicaragua – Cooperation mission to continue strengthening democratic institutions in
    Nicaragua. In light of the concerns expressed by the Secretary General of the OAS to the
    Government of Nicaragua on October 14, 2016, regarding the Nicaraguan electoral
    process taking place at the time, regulatory rules and procedures, the participation of
    political parties, and the identity documents required from voters, both parties agreed
    to establish a roundtable for conversation and constructive exchange to establish areas
    of joint work to address these issues. As a result of this dialogue, on February 28, 2017,
    the SG/OAS and the Government of Nicaragua, signed a Memorandum of
    Understanding.

    In the context of that memorandum, in May 2017, we deployed a cooperation mission
    whose principal objective is to strengthen Nicaragua's democratic institutions, with
    emphasis on improving the electoral process.

    From the moment the Mission began its operations, forming ties between the Mission,
    the Government of Nicaragua, and civil society organizations, meetings have been held
    with multiple political and social actors in Nicaragua to exchange information on the
    electoral process and, in particular, on the 2017 municipal elections.

    Through DECO, we deployed an Electoral Observation Mission (EOM/OAS) for the 2017
    municipal elections in Nicaragua. As a result, the EOM/OAS said the legal, technical,
    procedural, technological, and human aspects of the electoral processes would need to
    be strengthened.

o   We supported legislative branches:

    On technical cooperation, we worked with legislatures in Argentina, Chile, Costa Rica, and the
    state of Puebla, Mexico, by supporting them in their institutional modernization processes. Also,
    we joined with the Congress of Mexico to reach an agreement with academia and civil society to
    work together on accountability and access to information. Lastly, in the Congress of Colombia,
    we held two events to work on issues related to innovation and open parliament.

    On knowledge generation, we conducted online courses on issues related to parliamentary
    innovation and Open Parliaments. We also conducted working tables on the following subjects:
    (a) sustainable development and parliaments, (b) new technologies and social networks, and
    (c) document management. The results of the survey on young people and parliaments were
    published and preparation of the document entitled "Political communication and parliaments"
    began.

    To promote dialogue and interparliamentary cooperation, we worked with the Andean
    Parliament and the Central American Parliament on issues of youth, inclusion, and the
    environment In addition, we continued the Young Parliamentarians Forum.

o   We offered the service of political analysis and scenarios for knowledge management toward
    strengthening democracy and cross-pillar integration:

    We organized training sessions, workshops, and research presentations, including the following:
    presentation of the study “Social Network Communication by Electoral Authorities” during the
    Twelfth Inter-American Meeting of Electoral Management Bodies on the status of the situation
    of digital diplomacy and the impact of different models for online communication for improving
    access to information for more people during elections; the workshop “Effective online research
    practices” during the Fourteenth Plenary Assembly of ParlAmericas held in Medellín, during
    which legislators from the Americas discussed online search tools, databases for disaggregated
    data, and the use of social network; facilitation of workshops on research and digital rights in the
    University of Pennsylvania’s Internet Policy Observatory at Oxford University and at the
    Universidad de San Andrés in the United Kingdom and Argentina, respectively, workshops in
    which human rights defenders and academics shared reflections and methods for promoting
    more rights for more people in the digital age; and lectures for the staff of the General
    Secretariat and independent committees on thematic monitoring through use of the Americas
    Digital Information System (ADIS), the automatic media monitoring system managed by the
    political analysis and scenarios area.

    We strengthened institutional relations with other international organizations, particularly the
    United Nations Department of Political Affairs and the European Commission’s European
    External Action Service, with a view to sharing information on political analysis and scenarios,
    conflicts, and early warnings.

    We conducted the Desk-to-Desk Dialogue and Capstone of the Global Crisis Response Support
    Programme (GCRSP) with the European Union in Washington, D.C., Trinidad and Tobago, and
    Brussels. The GCRSP was a cooperation project funded by the European Union aimed at
    strengthening the capacity of regional organizations in Latin America and the Caribbean with
    regard to early warnings, interagency cooperation, creation of a virtual crisis room, gender
    mainstreaming, and thematic monitoring through the Americas Digital Information System of the

        OAS. The program, the first phase of which concluded in February 2017, involved the EU, the
        OAS, and four Caribbean agencies [Caribbean Public Health Agency (CARPHA), Caribbean
        Disaster and Emergency Management Agency (CDEMA), the Regional Security System (RSS),
        CARICOM Implementation Agency for Crime and Security (CARICOM IMPACS) and two of its sub-
        agencies, the Regional Intelligence Fusion Centre (RIFC) and the Joint Regional Communication
        Centre (JRCC).] Collaboration with them continues as a result of the program.

2.4 EXECUTIVE SECRETARIAT FOR INTEGRAL DEVELOPMENT (SEDI)

Summary of the accomplishments of the SEDI

In response to the strategic lines and objectives of the Comprehensive Strategic Plan approved by the
General Assembly at the end of 2016, and in line with 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, we
continued consolidating an intersectoral approach to programming based on the consensus and
priorities set by the CIDI in its ministerial meetings.

Results obtained by the SEDI

o      We promoted education and human development:

       We strengthened inter-American cooperation and coordinated with other bodies to guarantee a
       quality, inclusive, and equitable education, and supported opportunities for ongoing lifelong
       learning.

       We supported the Inter-American Educational Agenda (IEA) approved during the Ninth Inter-
       American Meeting of Ministers of Education (The Bahamas, February 2017), and in the
       framework of intersectoral dialogue with the Inter-American Conference of Ministers of Labor
       (IACML), we created a coalition with the International Labour Organization and the Caribbean
       Development Bank to find solutions to youth unemployment in the Caribbean, beginning by
       replicating and sharing Jamaica's apprenticeship program. The Development Cooperation Fund
       (DCF/OAS) approved US$1.5 million in seed funding that will be used in 2018 to support projects
       in 19 member states.

o      We strengthened teachers:

       Inter-American Teacher Education Network (ITEN): The Virtual Community of Practice reached
       more than 27,000 teachers and educators; ministries of education and organizations in 22
       member states were strengthened through 12 technical missions; more than 2,500 teachers in
       urban and rural areas were trained with virtual seminars (www.youtube.com/riediten) and audio
       programs; the Co-TEP knowledge bank reached 700 publications and research papers on policies
       and practices for teachers.

       Educational Portal of the Americas: 223 teachers and administrators trained to use technology in
       the teaching profession.

       We launched the Open Educational Resources Hub (OER Hub) for the Caribbean, with a
       subregional focus that offers educators at all levels a public digital library and the opportunity to
       collaborate on using, evaluating, and improving open educational resources.

       We granted more than 4,000 scholarships through the OAS scholarship and training program and
       90 educational loans through the Leo Rowe Fund, benefiting citizens of all member states.

       More than 200 institutional partners made financial and in-kind contributions, including the
       Grupo Coimbra, from Brazil; CONACYT, from Mexico; the Agencia Chile de Cooperación
       Internacional para el Desarrollo (AGCI); the University of the West Indies; the Centro del Agua

o   We promote decent, dignified, and productive work:

    We facilitate dialogue and intersectoral cooperation to improve the situation of youth
    employment, facilitate the school-work transition, and respond to the challenges of the future of
    work in the fourth industrial revolution. Preparation of recommendations and policies, exchange
    of experiences, launch of the publication “The Coordination between Education and Labor in the
    Americas: Results of the Inter-Sectoral Workshop on Youth Employment,” and execution of two
    technical missions to design and implement public policies (Argentina-Paraguay and St. Kitts and
    Nevis and the United States) through the Inter-American Network for Labor Administration
    (RIAL).

    We made policy recommendations for all member states aimed at strengthening labor market
    information systems and policies on migrant workers, in partnership with the ILO and the IOM.
    Chile strengthened its action plan for migrant workers as a result of the technical cooperation in
    meeting held in Costa Rica.

    We deployed four technical cooperation missions on youth labor, labor migration, and domestic
    labor, completing 100 missions since the creation of the RIAL.

    We supported the drafting of the Declaration and Plan of Action of Bridgetown “Building on our
    Achievements and Advancing towards Social Justice, Decent Work, and Sustainable Development
    in the Americas,” adopted in the Twentieth IACML (Barbados, December 2017), to improve
    coordination between education and labor policies, address the challenges of the future of work,
    strengthen social dialogue, support sustainable enterprises, and advance toward gender equality
    and full guarantee of labor rights and opportunities for vulnerable populations.

o   We promoted inclusive and competitive economies:

    In terms of competitiveness, innovation, and technology, we supported the drafting of the 2017-
    2019 action plan (approved) for the Inter-American Competitiveness Network (Mexico,
    September 2017) to promote high value-added services and productive transformation through
    regional cooperation.

    More than 300 initiatives and collaborative projects resulted from the visits made by more than
    100 leaders from 30 member states to 58 innovation and entrepreneurship centers in two states

    of the United States (Texas and Florida) through two Americans Competitiveness Exchanges on
    Innovation and Entrepreneurship (ACE).

    We supported the drafting of the Declaration of Medellín “Science, Technology, and Innovation
    as Pillars of Transformation in the Americas,” adopted during the Fifth Meeting of Ministers and
    High Authorities of Science and Technology (Colombia, November 2017) to promote the
    generation of knowledge, creative skills, and problem-solving capacities needed for the jobs of
    the future and industry 4.0; more than 30 good practices were exchanged.

    Fifty professionals from the public and private sectors were trained on how to take technology
    from an idea to the market. Promotion of collaboration on innovation in the Caribbean and
    indicators for innovation and transformative technologies into roundtables; 132 best practices
    shared among more than 218 participants from 26 member states on issues of innovation,
    quality national infrastructure, human resource development, and technology development.

    For micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs), we supported drafting of the 2017-
    2019 work plan “Promoting Inclusive and Competitive Economies ” adopted during the Fifth
    Inter-American Dialogue of High-Level MSME Authorities (Mexico, May 2017); 25 good practices
    were exchanged among 26 countries.

    Three more member states (Antigua and Barbuda, St. Kitts and Nevis, and The Bahamas) joined
    the Caribbean Small Business Development Centers Program (SBDC); five beneficiary countries
    (Antigua and Barbuda, Dominica, Jamaica, Saint Lucia, and Saint Kitts and Nevis) received
    assistance on establishing a legal and regulatory framework to strengthen MSME support
    ecosystems.

    In 12 SBDC Program beneficiary countries, 6,000 registered clients (40% of them women and
    young people) received guidance, 30 organizations were exposed to the SBDC model, and 55
    universities and professionals were trained; 132 advisors were trained on use of the global
    supply chain (220) and the Neo Serra program (22).

                                              - 34 -


o   We strengthened sustainable development objectives pursuant to the Inter-American Program
    for Sustainable Development 2016-2021:

    We organized or participated in more than 50 events aimed at developing capacity, promoting
    dialogue, coordinating progress and exchanging information and experiences on sustainable
    development.

    We trained 500 municipal officials in six member states on sustainable management of cities;
    600 officials from the executive, legislative, and judicial branches on the status of environmental
    law and the application of access rights and principles for and approaches to public participation;
    and we trained 120 GS/OAS officials to incorporate disaster risk management into their work,
    pursuant to Executive Order No. 16-04.

    We supported States in the design of regional instruments: The Declaration of Principles and
    two-year action plan adopted by energy ministers to consolidate the energy and climate
    partnership of the Americas (ECPA), fostering shared leadership, promoting dialogue, and
    supporting technical cooperation on sustainable energy; a strategic vision and action plan for
    sustainable cross-border management of water resources in the River Plate basin, agreed upon
    by Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay; a regional vision and regional development
    policy for sustainable cross-border management of ecosystems in the Gran Chaco region; and
    master plans approved for the five Trifinio subregions. The Department’s partnerships with key
    regional and international bodies produced notable results, including its partnership with the
    Global Judicial Institute on the Environment, which resulted in collaboration with the UN
    Environment Programme (UNEP) and the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).

o   We furthered collaboration and coordination on disaster risk management:

    We reached a new agreement on post-disaster response with the White Helmets Commission of
    Argentina and deployed a technical mission to help Dominica rebuild its water supply systems
    following Hurricane Maria.

    We enhanced the natural disaster risk management capacity of 120 officials of the General
    Secretariat through nine training courses.

    We received the 2017 Government Marine Environment Protection Award from the American
    Marine Environment Protection Association (NAMEPA) for promoting initiatives to support green
    port operations, capacity building, and environmental protection.

o   Regarding sustainable management of ecosystems, we enhanced the capacity of officials from
    the Dominican Republic, Grenada, Jamaica, Saint Lucia, and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines to
    evaluate and manage ecosystem goods and services.

o   On integrated management of water resources:

    We trained 14 energy officials in the Caribbean on effective management of the water-energy
    nexus.
-----------------------Page 37 End-----------------------

                                             - 35 -


    We were able to adopt a strategic vision and action plan for sustainable cross-border
    management of water resources in the River Plate Basin and Gran Chaco (Argentina, Bolivia,
    Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay).

    We developed master plans for the Lempa, Pomola, Quilio, Sesecapa, and Tulas river regions of
    the Trifinio, approved by Trifinio member states. We developed an interactive “Tropical Climate
    Application” platform used by Trifinio member states.

o   We contributed to the sustainability of cities and communities:

    We trained 500 municipal officials in Central America and the Caribbean on different aspects of
    sustainable city management.

    We developed and shared tools and measures for sustainable city and community development
    with urban planning officials in Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Saint
    Lucia, Saint Kitts and Nevis, and Trinidad and Tobago.

    We mobilized US$3 million in additional financial resources through an increase in small grants
    and direct contributions from countries for giving courses and developing sustainable
    communities.

    We promoted sustainable energy management, prioritizing the promotion of clean, renewable,
    and environmentally sustainable energies and energy efficiency.

    The Action Plan included an agreement to strengthen the role and contribution of the Energy
    and Climate Partnership of the Americas as a regional mechanism to promote shared leadership
    and dialogue and support technical cooperation on sustainable energy between governments,
    the financial sector, the private sector, academia, and other related organizations.

    A regional action plan was adopted by the member states of the Central American Integration
    System (SICA) to develop unified energy efficiency norms and standards and to develop in their
    countries the institutional capacity to measure energy efficiency and conduct compliance
    evaluations.

o   We enhanced capacity for efficient, effective, responsible, and inclusive sustainable
    development institutions.

    We developed and initiated implementation of the Inter-American Program for the Development
    of Judicial Capacity on Environmental Rule of Law, which is in progress.

    We published a document assessing trends, challenges, and opportunities in environmental rule
    of law in the Americas.

    We trained 600 officials from the executive, legislative, and judicial branches of Member States
    on environmental rule of law.

    We trained 250 people in the application of the rights and principles of access and approaches to
    public participation.

                                             - 36 -


    With the OAS as a key partner, we launched the Global Judicial Institute on the Environment to
    facilitate exchange of information and experiences and facilitate access to resources.

o   We strengthened development cooperation and established partnerships:

    18 member states strengthened their capacities thanks to a contribution of US$3.2 million from
    the Development Cooperation Fund in its Programming Cycle (2014-2017), aimed to promote
    the creation and strengthening of comprehensive social protection systems and promote the
    creation of opportunities for productive employment, particularly among vulnerable groups.

    The following results stand out:

    Honduras strengthened its capacity to provide services to people with disabilities through an
    identification record and identified 17,285 people with disabilities and 28 municipalities in the
    Francisco Morazán Department and San Pedro Sula through the Honduras Para Todos program.
    The program led to a 50% increase in social interventions in 84 municipalities.

    The Dominican Republic developed the basic and entrepreneurial skills of 575 vulnerable young
    people to facilitate their entry into the labor market.

    Antigua and Barbuda established a Financial Empowerment Center, where 39 low-income
    families received personalized advice on how to improve their financial situation so they could
    exit State assistance programs by achieving self-support. El Salvador implemented a program in
    which 75 young people acquired knowledge and skills through training and hands-on experience
    in developing video games in order to meet the needs of the market and reduce youth
    unemployment. We conducted eight south-south technical cooperation exchange missions in
    which social protection and inclusion knowledge, good practices, and models were exchanged,
    along with strategies for creating productive employment.

o   Through Cooperanet, we made progress in 18 projects in five countries aimed at adapting the
    Sustainable Development Goals (SDO) statistical reporting platform presented by the United
    States during the joint session of the Permanent Council and CIDI (April 2017).

2.5 SECRETARIAT FOR MULTIDIMENSIONAL SECURITY (SMS)

Summary of the accomplishments of the SMS

We designed the Homicide Knowledge Platform and made it available to member states in the
framework of the Inter-American Network for the Prevention of Violence and Crime. This platform
collects information on interventions conducted to prevent homicide, lessons learned, and homicide
rates in the region. Preventing and reducing intentional homicide was ranked a priority issue on the
Hemisphere’s security agenda, making possible the preparation of a hemispheric plan for homicide
reduction in 2018. Lastly, we prepared and launched an information system on crimes affecting
undocumented migrants in Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras,
Mexico, and Panama. This is a valuable tool for establishing policies to prevent crime against
undocumented migrants.

With the work done by the Secretariat for Multidimensional Security (SMS), we were able to strengthen
interdepartmental coordination, enabling more integrated and cooperation-oriented action and
strengthening the capacities of OAS member states to deal with threats, concerns, and other security
challenges in the Americas. To accomplish this, the SMS designed and implemented standardized
planning and monitoring tools that provide information annually on the execution of all projects in the
Secretariat’s departments. The SMS was also able to integrate its administrative and financial processes
and train staff on the use of results-based administrative and project management tools.

2.5.1   Inter-American Drug Abuse Control Commission (CICAD)

Summary of CICAD accomplishments

We held two regular sessions of the Commission: The Multilateral Evaluation Mechanism for the Seventh
Round was approved. We developed technical assistance and training programs to benefit more than
2,600 people by reducing demand, reducing supply, providing alternatives to prison, improving territorial
management, and collecting and analyzing data on drugs.

Results obtained by CICAD

o       In the Capacity Building in Drug Control and Technical Assistance Section, we trained 250 anti-
        drug officials in 14 countries on strategic, operational, and forward-looking antidrug intelligence.

        We provided technical assistance by diagnosing the investigative and analytical capacity of the
        agencies involved in combating illegal drug trafficking in Southern Cone countries.

        We set up a website that compiles news on cannabis policies.
        http://www.cicad.oas.org/Main/Template.asp?File=/drogas/cannabis/default_eng.asp

        We evaluated alternatives to prison for drug addicted offenders (drug treatment tribunals) and
        reached agreements on them with the executive and judicial branches of six countries (five
        finalized in situ). We also trained 200 professionals.

        We strengthened civil society participation in the CICAD regular sessions.

    therapeutic justice program. Twenty-two pilot programs were established in five states.

    We provided training and technical assistance to 337 municipal officials and leaders of National
    Drug Commissions on territorial management of drug policies.

    We disseminated approaches, methodologies, tools, and good practices to strengthen capacities
    in Latin America's municipalities to address the drug problem.

    We made progress toward broader understanding of Comprehensive and Sustainable Alternative
    Developments in the Americas as a way of complementing and reinforcing the objectives of the
    2030 Sustainable Development Agenda.

    We developed multi-platform teaching materials for the Universal Treatment Curriculum for
    health professionals, training 824 professionals in six countries.

    In the framework of PROCCER execution, we trained 900 service providers in Panama and the
    Dominican Republic.

    We trained and certified 43 participants in Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago on conducting
    interventions with adolescents in the framework of the PROCCER model.

    We signed memoranda of understanding with six universities to promote addiction science as a
    multidisciplinary field and provided incentives to member states to develop research, training,
    international collaboration, and networks in this field.

    We developed two academic certification programs for prevention and treatment service
    providers, to be added to the course catalog of the University of the West Indies (UWI)

    We developed a marijuana module to be added to UWI’s adolescent intervention training
    module.

    We benefited more than 80 participants with the following: “Training UPC Trainers,” “Adolescent
    Intervention Training,” and regional meeting “Strengthening Healthcare Systems,” in the
    framework of the Third ISSUP Workshop on prevention and treatment certification.

o   Evidence-based Drug Policy Section:

    We conducted 16 virtual and face-to-face meetings of the Inter-Governmental Working Group
    (IWG) of the Multilateral Evaluation Mechanism (MEM); we prepared four Seventh Round
    operational documents, which were approved by the CICAD 62 (December 2017).

    We provided El Salvador with technical support for its school survey report; conducted technical
    training in Guatemala on how to develop a drug information network; and provided technical
    assistance to Panama on developing its national household survey report.

    We completed the pilot process for collecting data by using an online data collection system
    developed at the beginning of 2017. Data from this system will feed the next report on drug use
    in the Americas 2018.

                                                - 39 -



       We conducted a statistical analysis for the Colombian household survey on drug consumption, as
       well as surveys on drug use in four Andean countries.

       We prepared a rapid assessment report on drugs and at-risk youth between the ages of 18 and
       25 in the Bahamas; prepared a report to provide a rapid assessment of the situation in Jamaica;
       and published a manual entitled “Standardized Indicators for National Drug Information
       Networks in the Caribbean.”

       We participated as an institutional member of the scientific advisory committee of the UNODC
       for the World Drug Report.

capacity of member states—including their computer incident response—and for designing and
implementing policies and initiatives to prevent, combat, and eliminate terrorism through developments
of laws, regulations, and cooperation mechanisms.

Results obtained by CICTE

       were approved in Chile, Costa Rica, Mexico, and Paraguay; national cybersecurity policies were
       developed for Guatemala and the Dominican Republic; a report on the impact of computer
       incidents was published in Colombia; and a survey was prepared on the impact of computer
       incidents on the banking sector in Latin America and the Caribbean.

       We strengthened technical capacities: training for 3,000 public and private sector officials
       included information security management, computer incident response, and measures to
       enhance gender diversity in the cybersecurity field.

       We increased the effectiveness of regional/international cooperation: 66 governments officials
       from the computer security incident response teams of 16 member states participate in the

2.6 SECRETARIAT FOR ADMINISTRATION AND FINANCE (SAF)

The Secretariat for Administration and Finance (SAF) includes the Department of Human Resources;
Department of Financial Services; Department of Information and Technology Services; Department of
Procurement Services; and Department of General Services. The SAF provides all of the areas with
leadership, direction, and guidance on administrative support activities, while directly carrying out the
administrative functions critical to the General Secretariat.

Summary of the accomplishments of the Office of the Secretary of the SAF

In 2017, the Office of the Secretary for Administration and Finance continued to support the
Organization's policy-making bodies, mainly the Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Affairs
(CAAP), serving as the primary link between the CAAP and General Secretariat. We also supported the
efforts of the Permanent Council working group to implement the Management Modernization plan.

Results obtained by the Office of the Secretary of the SAF:

o       Coordination with all areas of the General Secretariat to facilitation execution of programs from
        an administrative and financial standpoint. Despite the limitations of the budgetary execution
        ceiling established for 2017, the SAF—through careful management of expenditures and
        revenues—was able to accommodate a variety of budgetary needs during this difficult year.
o       With improvement of the financial situation thanks to payment of quotas by member states, we
        were able to repay loans from the Treasury Fund incurred since 2015; it was also possible to fully
        repay the Capital Fund for Scholarships.
o       We continued to review internal controls and procedures to strengthen record keeping on
        financial information. This is critical to building donor confidence about OAS capacity to properly
        control execution of contributions to the Specific Fund for OAS projects.
o       Although no resources have been located to fund the modernization of our OASES platform—
        which is essential for daily OAS operations—the General Secretariat is moving forward with the
        strategic plan on technology and information services, in compliance with the mandate of
        resolution AG/RES. 2911 (XLVII-O/17).
o       We continued to work hard to overcome the challenges presented by the excessive workload
        while also compensating for the positions left vacant during 2017.
o       We reported to member states on progress and challenges with the “Semiannual Resource
        Management and Performance Report of the OAS.” The report describes SAF activities and
        responds to the recommendations of the Board of External Auditors of the OAS and the
        mandates derived from the budget resolution.

2.6.1   Department of Human Resources (DHR)

Summary of the accomplishments of the DHR

In addition to the comprehensive human resources services provided to the General Secretariat, during
2017, the Department of Human Resources (DHR) conducted a number of activities and projects that
contributed to the well-being of staff and compliance with mandates assigned. Despite financial
challenges, and taking into account their significant impact on the human capital of the General
Secretariat, we conducted activities focused on improving the labor environment for staff by
strengthening the sense of belonging to the organization and recognizing the efforts made every day by
the staff.
-----------------------Page 47 End-----------------------

                                                      - 45 -



Results obtained by the DHR

o      Activities to contribute to staff wellbeing:

       Six seminars were held, covering prevention issues in physical and mental health.

       We offered two workshops on first-aid for new fathers and mothers.

       We held the Annual Health Fair, which more than 300 people attended. The fair offered
       preventative cardiovascular tests (electrocardiograms, echograms, and echocardiograms) and
       tests of cholesterol and glucose levels.

       We did awareness-raising campaigns on cancer and heart disease and held a flu vaccination day.
       Altogether, more than 2,130 participants attended these activities, including OAS staff,
       consultants, interns, affiliates, and retirees.

       We held a "Staff Awards and Recognition Ceremony" and the "End of Year Celebration with the
       Secretary General." Both institutional events gathered together the entire staff with the
       objective of recognizing and awarding efforts and emphasizing the importance of celebrating
       accomplishments and confronting emerging challenges together.

       Competition processes: We managed 49 statutory competition processes of a total of 56
       scheduled, completing 34 of them during 2017, which enabled progress toward formalizing the
       contractual situation of 49 staff members; we administered 37 competitive processes to fill
       vacancies in the General Secretariat, allowing for new staff to be taken in to complete the
       projects and fulfill the mandates of the General Secretariat; the competitive process defined in
       Article 121 of the General Standards for hiring the Inspector General was conducted, and the
       Inspector General was brought on board in July 2017; we launched a competitive process to hire
       the director of the Department of Human Resources, in compliance with Judgment 165, issued
       on December 29, 2016 by the Administrative Tribunal.

o      Efficiencies: together with the Department of Information and Technology Services (DOITS), we
       implemented the first phase of the new automated certificate of employment request system.
       The system enables staffers to obtain their own employment certifications electronically with
       the “press of a button,” and instantly. This is the first phase of the initiative. In the future, more
       options for employment certifications will be added for the convenience of staffers.

       Internship Program: We received 1,920 applications for the three internship periods in 2017; 261
       interns participated in the program at headquarters and in the national offices of member
       states; through a Memorandum of Understanding with the Government of the Republic of
       Korea, four Korean students joined the Internship program at headquarters in 2017; in close
       collaboration with the Department of Press and Communications, the design and content of the
       Internship Program’s webpage was updated: www.oas.org/internships; we prepared an intern
       handbook providing useful information on the Organization and the Internship Program and
       helping the new interns travel and settle in to the city of Washington, D.C.

o      Internal communication: we began publishing a series of infographics to provide concise and
       graphical information to eligible staff members on the different benefits (maternity leave,
-----------------------Page 48 End-----------------------

                                                  - 46 -


        paternity leave, etc.) and services (explaining how G-4 visa holders can obtain a driver's license,
        etc.) that the DHR offers.

o       Audits of the main human resources processes: in compliance with the directives of member
        countries found in section III.A.11(c) of resolution AG/RES. 2 (LI-E/16), Program-Budget of the
        Organization for 2017, the Office of the Inspector General conducted an audit of staff transfer
        processes, internal and external competitions, and reclassifications. The Office of the Inspector
        General has presented its report concluding that the Organization’s regulations are being fully
        followed.
o       Comprehensive human resources strategy: we have been actively working with the Working
        Group on Review of OAS Programs of the CAAP with a view toward reviewing and defining a
        comprehensive human resources strategy to facilitate aligning the General Secretariat workforce
        to the strategic needs and vision of the Organization.
o       New salary and benefits structure implemented: we implemented the new salary structure
        approved by the United Nations. The DHR provided support to the staff affected by this change
        by providing personalized and timely information. The implementation was carried out without
        errors and with total transparency for the affected officials.

2.6.2 Department of Financial Services (DFS)

Summary of the accomplishments of the DFS

In 2017, the DFS completed nine external audits of projects financed with specific funds that were
requested by donors. The reports were clean – “Unqualified opinions,” which is the best outcome
possible with these types of audits. In addition, we have maintained regular maintenance of
accountability of all funds of the Organization, through the OAS website

Despite this, the DFS lacks added capacity to reassign the functions of frozen positions, and is operating
at maximum capacity without the optimal number of staff. To close this gap, the DFS has been forced to
increase the number of performance contracts. This situation puts adequate short-, medium-, and long-
term functioning of internal financial controls at risk.

                                                  - 48 -



Outcomes obtained by the DFS (financial outcomes of the main funds administered by the General
Secretariat of the OAS*)

Regular Fund:

o       The special General Assembly session on November 16, 2017, adopted the program-budget for
        January-December 2018, for US$84,822,831, with an execution ceiling of $81,575,000, which is
        higher than the execution ceiling of US$73,500,100 adopted for the January-December 2017
        fiscal period. In order to finance it, a net allocation of quotas for $84,519,231 and other income
        of $303,600 was established.
o       By the end of fiscal year 2017, the General Secretariat had executed $73.4 million, equivalent to
        99.9percent of the approved budget. The under execution of the budget by $0.1 million
        represents savings that help increase the Reserve Subfund of the Regular Fund.
o       The Reserve Subfund ended 2017 with a positive balance of $1.7 million, the first positive
        balance since 2010. However, the balance would be even higher if the balance of quotas owed of
        US$12.0 million were included.
o       As of December 31, 2017, the cash balance stood at US$4.0 million. During 2017, the loans from
        the Treasury Account of the OAS were fully repaid, pursuant to resolutions CP/RES. 1046
        (2013/15), CP/RES. 1059 (2060/16), and CP/RES. 1072/17 adopted by the Permanent Council.
        Also, the final repayment of the loan from the Capital Fund for Scholarships was made, pursuant
        to resolution CEPCIDI/RES.187/11.

Specific Funds:

o       Contributions to the Specific Funds totaled $57.4 million in 2017, compared to US$45.8 million in
        2016, an increase of US$11.6 million, equivalent to 25 percent.
o       The three largest contributors in 2017 were from the United States, with $25.1 million,
        equivalent to 43.7 percent of the total; followed by Canada, with $7.8 million or 13.6 percent;
        and the United Kingdom, with $3.7 million or 6.4 percent. The contributions from member states
        accounted for 73.8 percent of the total received, while contributions from permanent observers
        comprised 20.9 percent, with other donors and institutions accounting for 5.3 percent.
o       Compared to 2016, the member states increased their contributions by 45 percent.
        Contributions from permanent observers also increased slightly, by 4percent. However,
        contributions from other donors and institutions declined by 35 percent.
o       In 2017, Specific Funds execution totaled $54.7 million, slightly higher compared to 2016. Of that
        total amount, 33.7 percent were for expenditures related to projects under Chapter 6 -
        Secretariat for Strengthening Democracy; followed by 28.1 percent, under Chapter 8 -
        Secretariat for Multidimensional Security; and 12.8 percent under Chapter 3 - Executive
        Secretariat for Integral Development.
o       Regarding total expenditures of US$56.6 million, US$19.5 million or 34.3 percent was for
        expenditures on performance contracts, while US$10.7 million or 18.9 percent were for
        expenditures on staff, and US$9.7 million or 17.1 percent was for travel expenses.

Indirect cost Recovery Fund (ICRF):

o       Revenue for the year totaled $7.3 million compared to 2016, which saw $6.3 million. This
        represents an increase of 15 percent. This is due mainly to the seasonality of the programing of
        funding received in previous years and higher contributions during 2017.

o       As of the end of fiscal 2017, the General Secretariat had executed $4.2 million, equivalent to
        94percent of the approved budget. The underexecution of the budget by $0.3 million
        represented savings that helped increase the Reserve Fund of the ICR Fund.
o       The ICR Reserve Fund closed 2017 with a positive balance of $5.7 million.

2.6.2   Department of Information and Technology Services (DOITS)

Summary of the accomplishments of DOITS

During the period under consideration, the Department of Information and Technology Services (DOITS)
stepped up its efforts to keep the Organization’s information, communications and services
infrastructure operational.

Results obtained by the DOITS

o       Technology infrastructure:

        We saw an increase in storage of information generated, with a year-on-year increase of 12
        percent.

        We continued with a project to consolidate the virtual infrastructure of servers (reducing the
        carbon footprint).

        There was a confirmed increase in demand for wireless communications for mobile devices.

        Help Desk activity remained at previous levels (around 8,000 tickets received).

        A new cloud data backup system was implemented.

        Work was completed on the project to replace more than 160 obsolete workstations using the
        Windows XP operating system that posed a serious information security risk for the
        Organization.

        Full renovation of the GS/OAS computer and communications infrastructure was put to a
        competitive bidding process and begun.

        The absence of a capital fund has prevented DOITS from making headway with the
        recommendations that arose out of the adopted OAS Modernization Project, which are vital to
        ensuring that the Organization remains functional.

o       Information Technology Security: Activity designed to prevent and trigger alerts in the event of
        cyberattacks was maintained at normal levels (some 100,000 incidents analyzed). However, with
        the incorporation of new early detection and mitigation techniques, the number of actions taken
        increased considerably in an attempt to secure the Organization's network as much as possible.

o       Application development: Due to the constant reduction in its personnel and the shortage of
        available Regular Fund financing, this Department has had to stretch its capacity to the utmost.
        Those budgetary constraints prevented it from implementing new services to increase the

       productivity of OAS staff and deal with all the new system requirements that the substantive
       areas of the Organization needed based on mandates received, and with not being able to
       comply with Board of External Auditors recommendations, particularly those on the need to
       update the Organization’s internal management systems (OAS ERP).

       Despite this, new applications were launched: a new system was set up for authorizing
       budgetary reinforcements; Department of Human Resources processes were automatized under
       a “self-service” modality; integration of the scholarship management system with the GS/OAS
       central control and management system continues; and programming on a new travel
       management system was completed (currently in the testing phase).

       A new platform for collaboration based on Microsoft technology was implemented.

       A new content management system based on Microsoft technology was implemented.

2.6.4 Department of Procurement Services (DPS)

Results obtained by the DPS

o      In Procurement Management, we continued to collaborate with multilateral organizations (IDB,
       World Bank, IMF, PAHO, and UN) on issues of common interest and to increase our negotiating
       power. The 2017 forum, hosted by the World Bank, confirmed that the OAS is falling behind on
       issues related to procurement, modernization, and best practices.
       The workload remained more or less the same. A total of 32,000 transactions were recorded,
       adding up to approximately US$80.6 million.
       We began 7 formal bidding processes and 7 medium orders. Contract negotiation resulted in
       savings of more than US$70,000.
       We were effective at reviewing the GS/OAS insurance portfolio to ensure coverage remained
       stable without increasing risk. In addition, premiums were reduced by almost US$4,000.
o      For travel management, we were able to save more than US$250,000 by effectively managing
       the travel agent services contract. The services were particularly important for dealing with
       weather issues during this year.
       Unused fares worth approximately US$30,000 were recovered.
       Tickets for providing the home leave benefit were acquired using corporate program exchanges.
       The savings exceeded US$40,000.
o      Regarding supplier management, we increased the number of preferential agreements with the
       Organization’s key suppliers. We achieve savings of more than US$375,000 by reviewing the
       terms of contracts, setting preferential prices, and conducting other key negotiations with hotel
       chains, suppliers of office products, and the major airlines.

       It is estimated that we saved more than US$30,000 by renewing the discount negotiated with
       our main supplier of computers.

o      We sought improved efficiencies in several areas through an ongoing process of development
       and updates. They include a legal review of the CPR system, expansion of the corporate credit
       card program, acquisition and implementation of a system for handling competitive bidding
       online, comprehensive review of procurement regulations, a review of policies and procedures,
       and so on.

2.6.5   Department of General Services (DGS)

Summary of the accomplishments of DGS

In 2017, the goals proposed in the annual operational plan were achieved. They were geared towards
managing general services for the operation of the General Secretariat and maintenance of its facilities.
Achievements were made in building maintenance, where we developed a strategy for monthly control
and analysis of energy consumption; made initial contacts and took the preliminary steps for the use of
solar panels; and executed important deferred maintenance projects. Regarding security, progress was
made on modernizing equipment, training staff, and strengthening cooperation and communication with
federal security agencies. In terms of inventory, we updated property records at headquarters and at the
national offices; and in the messaging, mail, transportation, and photocopy section, service continued
and improvements were made to equipment to support the Organization's operational work. In terms of
space rental fees, we were able to raise the fees on offices and event spaces, thus contributing
significant resources toward meeting financial obligations and covering building maintenance.

Results obtained by the DGS

o       For building management and maintenance, we executed significant maintenance projects,
        including deferred maintenance considered critical and high-priority in the mechanical, security,
        and general repairs areas. These included replacements of the condensation pumps in the
        Administration Building (ADM), Main Building (MNB), and General Secretariat Building (GSB);
        replacement of 21 induction units in the MNB (in progress), and the update of the fire alarm
        system in the Art Museum of the Americas and the Casita, as well as repair of sidewalks in front
        of the MNB and repaving of the C St. parking lot. Also, steps were taken to begin repairs on the
        marble joints in the ADM to prevent water leakage and structural decay of the building.
        Engineering studies were also conducted on updating the heating systems in the ADM, MNB, and
        Museum (AMA) by replacing the steam system supplied by the district with a system of high-
        efficiency gas boilers.

        We implemented measures for reducing water consumption, achieving a reduction in
        consumption of 1,068,108 gallons, or 13 percent. We also continued the process of replacing
        incandescent lightbulbs with LED light bulbs to save electricity.

o       In the Security Section, we improved systems by replacing and repairing surveillance and
        monitoring equipment that was part of the closed-circuit system covering the garages and
        buildings. A monitoring station for the Museum of the Americas was added to the system.

        We strengthened communication and cooperation with the U.S. federal security services and
        improved the capacity of the OAS security service to provide support during events and
        diplomatic visits to the Organization’s facilities.

        In close collaboration with the company that provides security services, we developed and
        implemented a new structure for staff supervision and a new training program with the aim of
        increasing efficiency and service performance in the framework of the established contractual
        requirements.

        In the Messaging, Mail, and Transportation Section, we performed the unit’s operational
        activities by providing all services related to messaging, mail, and transportation as requested.
-----------------------Page 54 End-----------------------

                                             - 52 -


    We also took actions aimed at modernizing and/or replacing the machinery and equipment used
    to deliver mail.

o   In terms of inventory, we updated the equipment registry, adding capital goods worth a total of
    US$5,428,513.89 and removing 795 items at headquarters and national offices/projects. The
    mass reassignment of property in the inventory system was set up and automated, thus saving
    time. Also, supporting documentation was digitalized, thus reducing the amount of physical
    space it occupied and making it easier to search.

o   We increased the GSB office rental and storage space to a total of 53,118.85 square feet,
    generating US$2,089,175. Rental of the Hall of the Americas and other spaces increased 18
    percent compared to 2016, thanks to new clients and more events being held there.

    In coordination with the Conferences Department, we were able to make important progress
    toward standardizing an events calendar to streamline the processes of managing and
    coordinating services for the various areas involved in special events.

    We improved the efficiency of operations in different areas and reduced the impact on the
    environment. We acquired new (how many) multifunctional photocopiers. Through an internal
    awareness campaign, we reduced the number of copies/printings by 200,000 compared to 2016.

2.8 SECRETARIAT FOR ACCESS TO RIGHTS AND EQUITY (SARE)

Summary of the accomplishments of the SARE

Thanks to work by the Secretariat for Access to Rights and Equity, we are on track to continue
strengthening the agenda of access to rights and equity through the Department of Social Inclusion, the
Relations with Civil Society section, and the Inter-American Judicial Facilitators Program

Summary of the accomplishments of the Relations with Civil Society Section

During 2017, we collaborated closely with civil society organizations on redesigning the format of these
organizations’ participation in the General Assemblies. The new modality is based on a format of
coalitions self-managed by the civil society organizations themselves. As a result of this change, during
the forty-seventh regular session of the General Assembly of the OAS, held in Cancun, Mexico, 15
coalitions of organizations were able to participate, representing more than 300 civil society
organizations. Also, under this same format, 28 coalitions of civil society organizations have been
established to work on preparations for participating in the Eighth Summit of the Americas in 2018.
Likewise, 17 new organizations have been registered, and 32 more organizations have asked to be
included.

Results obtained by the Relations with Civil Society Section

o       We successfully implemented the new format for civil society organization participation.
o       We facilitated participation of 15 coalitions of organizations representing more than 300 civil
        society organizations in the forty-seventh regular session of the General Assembly of the OAS,

2.8.1 Department of Social Inclusion (DSI)

Summary of the accomplishments of the DSI

In the DSI, we have continued consolidating the Organization’s social inclusion agenda. Toward doing so,
we pursued work that continues strengthening Inter-American political dialogue on issues such as social
development, migration, consumer rights, and the rights of vulnerable persons. On social development,
after a seven-year break, we have reactivated the Inter-American Committee on Social Development
(CIDES), which will lead preparations for the next Ministerial Meeting of Social Development, to be held
in 2018. In the area of migration, we have continued to provide evidence and prepared responses to
improve migration governance in the Americas by supporting and providing technical advisory services
to the Committee on Migration Issues (CMI) and promoting the contribution migrants make to
sustainable development. The Vulnerable Groups section has furthered actions to promote and
disseminate inter-American human rights instruments and nondiscrimination of vulnerable populations.
Also, on the ground, four national and subregional projects continue implementation, on issues including

Results obtained by the DSI

o        We have trained close to 350 public officials from the region on development and social
         protection, measuring multidimensional poverty, and inter-American treaties on social,
         economic, and cultural rights. Also, close to 3,300 people have been trained on Inter-American
         instruments that protect the human rights of vulnerable groups, particularly the Plan of Action
         for the Decade for Persons of African Descent in the Americas (2016-2025) and the American
         Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, and the Inter-American Convention on
         Protecting the Human Rights of Older Persons. Publicity campaigns focused on the issue of
         migration have succeeded portraying migrants in a positive light in the Americas, identifying
         them as agents of development for their countries of origin and destination. The campaigns
         reached an audience of close to 2 million people worldwide.

o        We have made the following contributions to the policy discussion on issues within DSI purview:
         The Fourth Report of the Continuous Reporting System on International Migration in the
         Americas (SICREMI 2017 OAS/OECD)
         Regional report on the Situation in the Americas of Flows of Undocumented Migrants from
         Africa, Asia, and the Caribbean, in collaboration with the IOM and the International Red Cross.
         Food Security and Emigration: Why people flee and the impact on family members left behind in
         El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras (UN World Food Program, the IOM, the IDB, the
         International Fund for Agricultural Development, and the OAS).
         Situation in the Americas of Flows of Undocumented Migrants from Africa, Asia, and the
         Caribbean with the International Organization for Migration (IOM).
         Presentation of the content of the Regional Report on the Situation of Persons with Disabilities in
         the Americas, which presents a pioneering diagnostic for the region by covering issues by looking
         at trends and statistics, as well as due to its broad coverage of countries.

o        We have reactivated the Inter-American Committee on Social Development (CIDES) following a
         seven-year break, once again taking up Inter-American leadership on issues of social
         development by electing its new leaders (2017-2019).

o        We presented and analyzed eight reports on 16 states party to the Protocol of San Salvador on
         their progress at the national level toward complying with their commitments on economic,
         social, and cultural rights, particularly the rights to social security, health, and education.

o        We successfully completed the CIADDIS-PAD2 monitoring process, with 100 percent of the
         national reports from states party to the CEDDIS evaluated with comments and
         recommendations delivered to the states party by thematic area. A total of 89% of the states
         party presented their reports, which will provide input for the Regional Observatory on
         Disability, currently being established.

o        We launched the social media campaign "Migrants Count in the Americas," focused on
         recognizing migrant contributions to sustainable development both in their countries of origin
         and in their destination countries, and emphasizing the importance of their inclusion in the

 Inter-American Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Persons with Disabilities and the Plan of
Action for the Decade of the Americas for the Rights and Dignity of Persons with Disabilities

       communities where they live. The campaign has reached an audience of more than 2 million
       people worldwide.

o      We named renowned professor Dr. Henry Louis Gates, Jr. as the Goodwill Ambassador for the
       Rights of Persons of African Descent in the Americas.

o      We created strategic partnerships with internationally important partners like the World Food
       Program, the anti-discrimination section of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner
       for Human Rights, the Inter-American Development Bank, the World Bank, the European
       Commission against Racism and Intolerance, the Central American Parliament, the Presidential
       Commission against Discrimination and Racism in Guatemala, the National Council for the
       Prevention of Discrimination in Mexico, the National Institution for Human Rights and
       Ombudsman of Uruguay, American University, and Associated Universities, Inc. (AUI), the Oxford
       Poverty and Human Development Initiative, the Organización Internacional de Teletones
       (ORITEL), IREX, the Gender, Equality and Population Program of Parliamentarians for Global
       Action, the Human Rights Commission of Mexico City, the Ombudsman of Panama, the
       Universidad de Chile, and the Central American Parliament.

2.9 SECRETARIAT FOR HEMISPHERIC AFFAIRS (SHA)

Summary of the SHA’s achievements

In 2017, with the Secretariat for Hemispheric Affairs, in fulfillment of the mandate of providing
intersectoral coordination for “hemispheric” strategic initiatives, we provided follow-up on the Secretary
General’s five strategic initiatives in order to promote their implementation, through the Committee to
Analyze Strategic Initiatives (CASIE). In particular, we are making progress in developing the initiative of
the School of Governance, which is expected to be launched in 2018. At the same time, we are using the
Committee to Analyze Strategic Initiatives to receive suggestions from the General Secretariat, with
respect to the subject of the Eighth Summit of the Americas.

Results achieved by the SHA

With the Secretariat for Summits, we are working closely with the Peruvian Government to carry out the
work plan that was drawn up and preparations for the Eighth Summit of the Americas. In that respect, in
2017, the volunteer contribution from the host country was received, and four meetings of the Summit
Implementation Review Group (SIRG) were held in April, June, September, and November, and a Policy
Dialogue was held in September on the theme of the Eighth Summit of the Americas: “Democratic
Governance against Corruption.”

We continue to support implementation of the OAS programs on open government, open data, public
procurement, and identity registration systems with the Department for Effective Public Management
(DGPE). It is worth highlighting that, in 2017, the Lecture Series of the Americas started up again with
Sergio Fajardo speaking in Washington, D.C., and the Secretary General speaking in Lima. The SHA has
also promoted participation to enrich the discussions at the preparatory meetings for the Eighth Summit
of the Americas. At the request of the Secretary General, the Director of DGPE has accepted additional
responsibilities as part of the Committee overseeing the activities and administration of the Mission to
Support the Fight against Corruption and Impunity in Honduras (MACCIH).

Through the sustainability plan that was drawn up with the Art Museum of the Americas (AMA), we
published the first Catalogue of the OAS Permanent Collection in over 30 years. We also continued to
support and concretize the creation of synergies and endorsements with the private sector, as well as
quality exhibitions with the support of the region’s art museums and launching again the Working Group
of Ambassadors Friends of the AMA, a key group for the Museums’ sustainability and the promotion of
its permanent collection in the principal galleries of the Americas and abroad. The contributions of
partners from outside the OAS continue to be important; it is worth underscoring, for example, the first
appraisal of the permanent collection in 30 years carried out pro bono by Sotheby’s.

Regarding the Columbus Memorial Library (CML), in order to grant the general public greater access to
the historical archives of the OAS, thanks to a donation from the former Assistant Secretary General and
former Permanent Representative of the United States to the OAS, Ambassador Luigi Einaudi, we have
been able to implement with greater speed the creation of a new web page which is scheduled to be
launched in 2018. In 2017, as part of the sustainability plan for this historical institution, which is
important to the Organization, the position of Chief Librarian which had been vacant since July 2016 was
filled.

               Second Meeting of Latin American Public Policies Students, Hall of the Americas

     2.9.1 Department for Effective Public Management (DGPE)

Summary of the DGPE’s principal achievements

The Department for Effective Public Management (DGPE) has the mission of contributing to making the
region’s public institutions more transparent and effective and ensuring they have public participation
mechanisms. In 2017, the GDPE’s initiatives encompassed three aspects: (1) we developed cooperation
projects that contribute to strengthening public management; (2) we provided tools, methodologies, and
strategies to civil servants, social leaders, and citizens so they can tackle the challenges of public
management; and (3) we facilitated dialogue and the exchange of experiences in public management
among representatives of the region, civil society, and political leaders.

Results achieved by the DGPE

In connection with technical cooperation:
        We implemented projects involving 15 member states, focusing on civil identity, public
        procurement, and open data.
        As part of the training component, 1,187 civil servants participated in the courses provided
        through the Virtual Campus of the School of Governance.
        The third edition of the OAS fellowship in open government facilitated the training of 23 young
        leaders from 14 countries of the region.
        As part of facilitating the dialogue in public management, opportunities for dialogue were
        strengthened with annual meetings on the subjects of public procurement, civil identity, open
        data, cadasters, property registration, and electronic government.

                                                 - 66 -


With the Universal Civil Identity Project of the Americas (PUICA):
       We issued birth certificates and national identity cards and corrected vital statistics registry
       information for the population of the municipalities and departments of the border areas of
       Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador.
       We conducted 21 awareness-raising and information drives for citizens and community leaders
       about the importance of civil identity in municipalities and departments of the border areas of
       Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador.
       We trained 448 vital statistics officers from border municipalities in Guatemala, Honduras, and El
       Salvador on the importance of civil identity.
       We provided support to the first phase of creating a vital statistics registration cross-checking
       platform in five countries (Ecuador, Argentina, Costa Rica, Guatemala, and El Salvador).
       We made technical recommendations shared with the Government of Haiti to plan a campaign
       to identify Haitian migrants registered in the National Regularization Plan for Foreigners in the
       Dominican Republic.

In the Effective Public Management Innovation Program:
         We carried out the Fourth Edition of the Inter-American Prize for Innovation in Effective Public
         Management, with the inclusion of two new categories: Innovation in the Gender Equality and
         Rights Approach and Innovation in Social Inclusion.
         We conducted the study on “Promoting the Integrity of Civil Servants in their Relationship with
         Citizens” and ensured that the Guidelines for the Management of Policies for Probity in the
         Public Administrations of the Americas were included as an annex to the General Assembly
         resolution AG/RES. 2905 (XLVII-0/17) Strengthening Democracy.
         We held a Dialogue Round Table on the principles of open government among authorities, civil
         society representatives, and the private sector in Costa Rica.
         We provided support through 15 technical assistance missions carried out in nine countries of
         the region on subjects such a public procurement, assessment methodology, regulatory and
         institutional reforms, among others.
         We conducted assessments and made recommendations on open data in public procurement
         containing information on the perspective of public procurement agencies in implementing the
         open procurement standard.
         We developed an online platform for sustainable public procurement in cooperation with the
         United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP).

Through the Open Government Program:
       We provided two technical assistance missions to the Governments of Guatemala and
       Dominican Republic in order to create national open data policies by organizing dialogue round
       tables attended by more than 150 persons per country from public institutions, civil society, the
       academic sector, and the private sector.
       We produced a regional open data work plan for 2018.
       We implemented the 2016 edition of the OAS Fellowship on Governance in the Americas, thus
       concluding a three-year cycle, during which the program trained 69 young leaders from public
       administration, civil society, and the private sector of 20 countries of the region; an active
       network of OAS Fellows was established, and 20 local open government projects were
       developed, seven of which were awarded seed funding from the German Government and are
       currently being implemented.
We improved access to training in the framework of the OAS School of Governance:
       We launched a web page for the OAS School of Governance which is comprised of more than 10
       training sessions provided by the General Secretariat of the OAS (GS/OAS).

                                                - 67 -


       We conducted an inventory of the characteristics, details, and formats of more than 200 training
       courses provided by the GS/OAS.
       We drafted a document “Findings on Training in the GS/OAS” where recommendations are made
       to improve the provision of training on the four pillars of the GS/OAS.
       We trained 1,187 civil servants, on the basis of 31 editions (24 open editions and 7 closed
       editions) provided through the Virtual Campus of the School of Governance.
       We established a new course developed and delivered on Value for Money with the support of
       the Inter-American Network on Government Procurement (RICG).
       We organized two Lecture Series of the Americas, the first held at OAS headquarters on Open
       Government delivered by Sergio Fajardo, and the second in Peru on Democratic Governance
       against Corruption delivered by Luis Almagro
       We received 1,746 visitors, among which students, servicemen, diplomats, and the general
       public on the basis of 58 guided tours and 20 information sessions.

2.9.2 Summits of the Americas Secretariat (SAS)

Summary of SAS’s achievements

In the Summits of the Americas Secretariat (SAS), we worked with the Peruvian Government to prepare
for the Eighth Summit of the Americas.

In 2017, we held four meetings of the Summits Implementation Review Group (SIRG): three regular
meetings and one ministerial meeting. In this context, progress achieved by the institutions of the Joint
Summit Working Group (JSWG) regarding the mandates of the Seventh Summit of the Americas was
presented at the April meeting. In the framework of the Ministerial SIRG meeting held in June, Peru
presented the theme of the Eighth Summit, that is, Democratic Governance against Corruption, which
was in turn also discussed at the September and November meetings of the SIRG in the light of its three
thematic proposals. The thematic areas of the Eighth Summit for which Peru provided conceptual papers
include the following: (i) democratic governance and corruption; (ii) corruption and sustainable
development; and (iii) aspects of cooperation, international institutionality, and public-private
partnerships.

Results achieved by the SAS

With the Summits Implementation Review Group (SIRG) we held meetings at which recommendations
were made by various sectors.

On the basis of presentations made by international experts on the Summit’s themes, including
presentations of results and conclusions of policy workshops and meetings previously held in
coordination with the Peruvian Government, institutions belonging to the Joint Summit Working Group
(JSWG), and think tanks, among others, we organized the “High-Level Policy Dialogue on the theme of
the Eighth Summit,” organized jointly with the Peruvian Government and the Inter-American Dialogue, in
Washington, D.C., in September and the “Workshop of Experts on Governance and Institutions in the
Infrastructure Sector,” sponsored and organized by the Development Bank of Latin America (CAF), the
Peruvian Government, and the SAS.

Every SIRG meeting was also enriched by recommendations made by civil society and social stakeholders
of the region, including the progress made at the Fifth Forum of Young People of the Americas and the
Third Entrepreneurial Summit.

With the Joint Summit Working Group (JSWG) we were able to do the following:

        We presented the document “Compilation of Institutional Reports 2016 to April 2017” and the
        publication following up on the Seventh Summit “Cooperating for the Americas – 2017,” at the
        SIRG’s ministerial meeting held in June 2017.

        We also held a Workshop on Monitoring and Using the Summits of the Americas Follow-up
        System (SISCA) in Peru, and we provided support to various states in the process of preparing
        and submitting their annual national reports.

        In the context of the SISCA, we received reports from 10 institutions belonging to the JSWG and
        two member states (Guatemala and Mexico). Two national reports are also in the process of
        being prepared.

                                                  - 70 -



        In 2017, the JSWG met with Peru as the host country on three occasions in order to exchange
        information and present technical contributions to the theme of the Eighth Summit. The JSWG
        reiterated its commitment to provide its full support to preparing this Summit on the basis of
        technical assistance and orientation in the relevant areas, actively participating in the three
        regular meetings of the SIRG and at the ministerial meeting.

With civil society and social stakeholders in the Summits process:

        We strengthened the participation of, and contribution from, civil society organizations and
        social stakeholders in the Summits process, in particular, in order to prepare for the Eighth
        Summit. In this effort, the Summits Secretariat highlights the cooperation provided by the 32
        OAS National Offices and the area of OAS Relations with Civil Society. Activities carried out by
        the SAS include:

                Holding six informative sessions, in March 2017, with 329 participants from civil society

Art Museum of the Americas (AMA)

Summary of AMA’s achievements

We published AMA’s first catalogue on the permanent collection in 30 years. It is entitled “Art of the
Americas: Collection of the Art Museum of the Americas of the Organization of American States”
produced by a select group of experts from everywhere in the world with ties to the AMA. This
monumental publication is the most complete of its kind. It is comprised of 100 academic writings on
the most widely recognized works of modern and contemporary art from the AMA collection and
three academic essays on the collection and its founder, the Cuban critic and curator José Gómez Sicre.

Results achieved by the AMA

We acquired about 160 works for the permanent collection. They include works by the masters
Roberto Matta (Chile) and José Clemente Orozco (Mexico). AMA also secured the donation of 150
modern and contemporary works of art from Canadian artists, including many first-nation artists, as part
of the events celebrating the 150th anniversary of the Canadian Confederation.

We held 13 exhibitions in the Museum, the Gallery on F Street, and the Main Building of the OAS, and
we conducted about 40 guided tours for special groups and 16 other public programs.

We received about 27,000 visitors in 2017, which is the highest annual figure recorded, as a result of
an ambitious series of exhibitions and programs, a series of public events, and a rise in space rentals
for private events.

2.10       STRATEGIC COUNSEL FOR ORGANIZATIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND MANAGEMENT FOR RESULTS
           (SCODMR)

Summary of SCODMR’s main achievements

In the Strategic Counsel for Organizational Development and Management for Results (SCODMR), we
focused our efforts on supporting the implementation of the strategic lines and objectives of the OAS
Strategic Plan for 2016-2020 by strengthening the strategic planning and implementation process; the
two-year budget; implementation of the Organizational Development Program; strengthening external
funding and internal and external communication. Furthermore, through the SCODMR, we provided
support to political missions and represented the Secretary General on various occasions.

In 2017, we started the Organizational Development Program, which contributes to the process of
transforming and strengthening the Organization on the basis of the following: Integrated Programs that
provide a comprehensive response to the member states and mainstream the perspective of the four
pillars in the stages of analysis, design, and implementation of this response; the database of
competencies; focused training plans for the staff; process optimization and knowledge management.

In fulfillment of resolution CP/RES. 1065, we drew up a two-year budget that supports the transition
from an inertial budget to a budget that responds to the policy guidelines of the member states, as set
forth in the resolutions of the General Assembly of Cancún, Mexico. We also drew up the Strategic Plan
for Strengthening External Funding, in cooperation with the Organization’s Secretariats and in
consultation with member states and permanent observers.3

It should be stressed that, in 2017, it was possible to halt the progressive decline of contributions to the
specific funds that had been taking place over the years, securing a rise in OAS contributions from both
member states and permanent observers. Furthermore, we moved forward in the implementation of the
internal and external communication strategy aimed at contributing to ensuring that OAS is perceived by
external and internal stakeholders as a benchmark in issues relative to democracy, human rights,
multidimensional security, and integral development.

The detailed results achieved by the Strategic Counsel are provided below by area of SCODMR:

2.10.1 Department of Planning and Evaluation (DPE)

Summary of the DPE’s achievements

We drew up the draft two-year budget that the General Secretariat submitted to the consideration of
the member states. The proposal was made on the basis of the policy guidelines of member states
contained in resolutions AG/RES. 2908 “Promotion and Protection of Human Rights” and AG/RES. 2904
“Promoting Integral Development Strategies,” which provide funding for the pillars of human rights
(Inter-American Court of Human Rights, Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, Inter-American
Commission of Women, and Inter-American Children’s Institute), and integral development (Executive
Secretariat of Integral Development).

                                                  - 78 -


We established a relationship for the programs, products, and services of the Secretariats under the four
basic pillars of the GS/OAS, aligning them with the Organization’s Strategic Vision and the guidelines and
objectives of the Strategic Plan.

In order to support the Strategic Planning process, we trained staff from the missions and General
Secretariat in results-based management, and we made progress in defining the indicators and goals of
the Strategic Plan which were presented to the member states for their validation.

As for Results-based Program and Project Management, we continued to implement results-based
program and project management processes (design, monitoring, and evaluation) in the General
Secretariat, as well as strengthen human capabilities in those issues. New management tools were
created, such as guidelines for fund management, the processes involving the work of the Project
Evaluation Commission were improved, and a mechanism was created for following up on the
recommendations made in the external evaluations of programs and projects.

Results achieved by the DPE

In the Planning, Budget, and Mandate Follow-up Support Section:

We provided technical assistance to the staff of the General Secretariat and the permanent missions for
the strategic planning exercise and the design and drafting of supplementary information (definition of
indicators, targets, time-frames, and persons responsible); review of the draft program-budget for 2018;
and the draft resolution for the 2018 budget.

We boosted knowledge about results-based management among the staff of the General Secretariat and
the delegates of the permanent missions, amounting to a total of 157 trained participants.

We made the following documents available to member states on the OAS web page entitled
“Accountability”:

        Official documents on the Strategic Planning Process published and available at:

Summary of achievements by Organizational Development (OD)

We launched the Organizational Development Program, which envisages, among other elements, the
implementation strategy for the OAS Strategic Plan, which is promoting institutional transformation and
capacity building. To this end, the necessary tools were identified and adapted, such as the Balanced
Score Card (BSC), as well as the database of competencies, the processes to be optimized, and the
conceptual framework of the Integrated Programs and their implementation methodologies. We
disseminated and promoted the concept of Integrated Programs with the member states as a strategy to
implement their policy guidelines and as a transformative element to achieve higher levels of
cooperation among the Organization’s four pillars and provide comprehensive responses to the
mandates of the member countries, as in the case of the first pilot Integrated-Program “Mitigating the
causes of forced migration,” which was started at the request of a member state and which is beginning
an unprecedented action with respect to how programs have been designed and implemented until
now.

We presented the OAS Strategic Plan Implementation Strategy to the Permanent Council’s Working
Group for Institutional Strengthening. The Working Group commended the efforts made by the General
Secretariat to modernize management.

Results achieved by the OD

We set up the team for the pilot Integrated Program aimed at addressing the issue of forced migration
with an inter-pillar approach. It was comprised of representatives of various secretariats and with the
participation of permanent representative ambassadors of the countries of the Northern Triangle of
Central America.

We developed the framework of reference for the labor competencies of the OAS in order to support the
institutional transformation and capacity building process. In this framework, the structure of the
database of competencies was designed, and a pilot program was carried out for its validation and
subsequent implementation throughout the Organization.

Along with the Secretariat for Administration and Finance (SAF), we identified and analyzed the
administrative processes susceptible to being optimized and we drafted proposals for their
improvement.

We supported the incubation of a pilot program for knowledge management spearheaded by the
Secretariat for Multidimensional Security, and it is expected that this experience will be reproduced in
the rest of the Organization.

We held two workshops on tools to prevent workplace harassment, aimed at improving the working
environment of the Organization.

We produced dissemination materials to support the OAS Strategic Plan Implementation Strategy, which
shall be disseminated in 2018 and addressed to the entire staff and all member countries.

We signed an agreement with American University’s Washington College of Law to grant scholarships to
OAS staff and citizens of member states to carry out studies on human rights.

2.10.2 Department of External and Institutional Relations (DEIR)

Summary of DEIR’s achievements

We were able to stop, in 2017, the progressive decline of contributions to specific funds that had been
occurring over the past few years, securing a rise in contributions to the OAS from both member states
and permanent observers.

We strengthened ties with strategic partners, coordinating communication with donors and presenting a
consolidated image of the OAS and its projects by organizing Donor Round Tables with member states
and permanent observers.

We designed a Strategic Plan for Strengthening External Funding in response to the mandate of
resolution AG/RES. 2911 (XLVII-O/17) issued by the General Assembly in Cancún, which instructs the
Secretary General to submit, in consultation with the Permanent Council, a Strategic Plan to secure the
external support and funding needed to implement the mandates of the member states and the
Organization’s priorities.

We started consultations with member states to receive inputs and recommendations for the Strategic
Plan for Strengthening External Funding.

In order to continue building up the fund-raising capacity of the GS/OAS, during the first semester of
2017, we launched the “Annual Report to Permanent Observers 2015-2016” in coordination with OAS
Secretariats in order to disseminate the Organization’s work and its most impactful projects.

For the purpose of highlighting the projects that require financial support, we organized seven Donor
Round Tables to present the programs of the Secretariat for Strengthening Democracy (SSD) and the
Secretariat for Multidimensional Security (SMS), as well as the programs of the IACHR, CIM, and PUICA.

Results achieved by the DEIR

We strengthened the strategic partnership of the OAS with the European Union on the basis of high-level
dialogues and meetings with the European External Action Service (EEAS) of the European Union for the
Heads of the EU Offices in 23 countries of Latin America and the Caribbean and with the 25 member
states’ ambassadors of the EU Political and Security Committee.

We facilitated bilateral discussions and exchanges between permanent observers and the technical areas
of the OAS, and we coordinated exchanges between the Secretary General, the Assistant Secretary
General, and the secretaries and directors of departments with the following permanent observers:
China, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Moldavia, the Netherlands,
Norway, Serbia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the European Union.

We organized a meeting with the European Commission’s Directorate-General for European Civil
Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations (ECHO), which was attended by member states and
permanent observers, for the purpose of informing them about the office’s work in natural disaster
management and exploring cooperation with the OAS.

                                                 - 84 -


We brought together permanent observers to analyze the situations of the countries impacted by
Hurricanes Irma and José and the earthquake in Mexico. The permanent observers provided relief and
emergency assistance and articles to Antigua and Barbuda, Dominica, Haiti, and Mexico.

We coordinated the Memorandum of Understanding between the General Secretariat and the Israeli
Government to build up cooperation on various issues, including cybersecurity, water, and
competitiveness.

DEIR Mandates

Resolution AG/RES. 2911 (XLVII-O/17) of the General Assembly held in Cancún on June 21, 2017,
instructs the Secretary General to present, in consultation with the Permanent Council, a Strategic Plan
to secure the external support and funding needed to implement the mandates of the member states
and the Organization’s priorities. SCODMR/DEIR helps the Secretary General to fulfill this mandate. On
the basis of Executive Order 08-01, rev. 7 and rev. 8, SCODMR/DEIR instructs the DEIR to coordinate ties
with permanent observers for the purpose of providing these strategic partners with information about
the Organization’s mission, priorities, and activities, as well as on the Hemisphere’s agenda.

2.10.3 Department of Press and Communications (DPC)

Summary of the DPC’s achievements

In the Department of Press and Communication (DPC), we continued to work toward fulfilling the
purpose set forth in the Communications Strategy of November 2015: “To get the OAS to be viewed by
key stakeholders (external and internal) as a facilitator of solutions in issues of democracy, human rights,
security, and integral development.”

In that respect, in 2017, the publication of articles mentioning the OAS in the region’s leading daily
newspapers grew by more than 23 percent, which along with the 41 percent rise last year accounts for a
74 percent growth since 2015 (see details below). Twitter followers in Spanish grew by 32 percent and,
in English, by 29 percent. In Facebook, followers in Spanish grew only slightly (by 2 percent), but reach
skyrocketed (+129 percent). In English, followers grew by 241 percent whereas reach grew by 35
percent. The OAS website, which is in the process of being renovated, bounced back in terms of single
hits by almost 9 percent and recorded an increase in web pages visited by almost 13 percent and the
viewing of videos also skyrocketed (full playbacks grew by 278 percent). Email messages grew slightly
(from 576 to 637), but the improvement in the opening ratio continued (more than 1.1 percent).

We strengthened the work for corporate management of communications (editing speeches, preparing
for interviews, designing and implementing communication plans), and renewal and standardization of
the image of the General Secretariat continued with the completion of a new handbook on institutional
image (publication is the only step missing).

3. AUTONOMOUS ENTITIES AND AGENCIES

3.1 INTER-AMERICAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS (I/A Court H.R.)

In 2017, the Court was comprised of the following: Roberto F. Caldas (Brazil), President; Eduardo Ferrer
Mac-Gregor Poisot (Mexico), Vice-President; Eduardo Vio Grossi (Chile); Humberto A. Sierra Porto
(Colombia); Elizabeth Odio Benito (Costa Rica); Raúl Zaffaroni (Argentina); and Patricio Pazmiño
(Ecuador). The Secretary of the Court is Pablo Saavedra Alessandri (Chile) and the Deputy Secretary is
Emilia Segares Rodríguez (Costa Rica). On December 31, 2017, the term of office of the Board of
Directors concluded. At the 120th regular period of sessions, the plenary Court unanimously elected
Judge Ferrer Mac-Gregor Poisot as President and Judge Vio Grossi as Vice-President; they started their
term of office on January 1, 2018 and shall end it on December 31, 2019.

Summary of achievements by the Court

The Court held four periods of session at its headquarters in San José, Costa Rica, and two periods
outside headquarters in Guatemala City, Guatemala, and Panama City, Panama. There were 15 public
hearings held on contentious cases and an evidence-gathering mission was carried out, consisting of a
visit to a penitentiary in Brazil to observe implementation of provisional measures. In the framework of
monitoring compliance with judgments, seven hearings were held and two court proceedings conducted
to check onsite compliance with the reparations that were ordered in five cases, two of them in
Guatemala and three in Paraguay.

The Court issued 14 judgments: 10 of them on the merits of contentious cases and four judgments of
interpretation. The Court issued two advisory opinions: OC 23/17 on the environment and human rights,
and OC 24/17 on gender identity and equality and nondiscrimination for same-sex couples. It also issued
29 resolutions for monitoring compliance with judgments. Twenty-two resolutions were issued for
provisional measures, and at present, the Court has 24 provisional measures in force.

The Inter-American Commission referred 18 new contentious cases to the Inter-American Court for
hearing. At the end of 2017, the Court has 35 contentious cases to settle and two requests for advisory
opinions. The Court increased the number of sessions for 2018, which will amount to 14 weeks.

Results achieved by the Court

Cooperation ties and forms were developed with other inter-American agencies, regional organizations,
or international institutions, for the implementation of activities.

In 2017, the member states of the OAS agreed to double the budget for the agencies of the inter-
American system of human rights over a three-year period, thereby promoting the institutional capacity
of the Inter-American Court to fulfill its mandate. The Court also continued to promote closer
institutional ties with the Inter-American Commission by holding joint meetings in April, June, and
September. In December 2017, for the first time in history, the Forum of the Inter-American Human
Rights System, jointly organized with the Inter-American Commission, was held. It was attended by
states, civil society, international organizations, universities, social and trade union movements, and the
general public.

                                                 - 89 -


The Court has kept fluid and beneficial ties with other regional courts. Regarding the European Court of
Human Rights (ECHR), in July, the President of the Inter-American Court met with the President of the
ECHR, Judge Guido Raimondi. An exchange program between the attorneys of the secretariats of both
courts is also in force. In July 2017, the first meeting between the Court and European Committee of
Social Rights was held. The Court also participated in plenary session 112 of the European Commission
for Democracy through Law (Venice Commission). As for the African Court on Human and Peoples’
Rights, the Inter-American Court has kept a fluid dialogue in the framework of a cooperation agreement.
In November 2017, it participated in the workshop to validate the “study on the framework for
monitoring compliance with and implementation of the judgments of the African Court” organized by
said Court in Arusha, Tanzania.

As for ties with the United Nations, in the framework of the 57th special period of sessions held in
Guatemala, the Court met with representatives of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human
Rights in order to discussion the willingness of both organizations to consolidate ties and share
instruments and experiences to protect human rights. Likewise, in December, the President and Vice-
President of the Court met with the Secretary General of the United Nations, António Guterres, to
engage in an in-depth dialogue between both organizations, as well as to invite him to participate in the
fortieth anniversary celebration of the Inter-American Court’s creation, to be held in July 2018.

In 2017, the Inter-American Court also entered into various cooperation agreements with national
courts, ministries, offices of human rights ombudsperson, universities, and human rights centers. These
agreements are especially significant for the strategic coordination of judicial dialogue aimed at
guaranteeing, widely and comprehensively, the defense of human rights of persons in the Americas.

The Court also organized 12 courses and seminars in various places of the region for the purpose of
broadening knowledge about the Court’s case law, as well as disseminating knowledge about the Inter-
American Human Rights Protection System. In addition, the Court has an important program of
internships and professional visits, which in 2017, welcomed 81 young people from 16 different
countries throughout the world.

3.2 INTER-AMERICAN COMMISSION ON HUMAN RIGHTS (IACHR)

Summary of the IACHR’s achievements

In 2017, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights promoted major institutional changes, with
important results. The case backlog fell by 10 per cent, achieving a historical minimum in terms of
petitions in the examination stage and a record in terms of admissibility reports in one year, owing to
measures such as the review of methodologies and workflows. Thematic and country monitoring was
mainstreamed and coverage was broadened with the establishment of three new thematic units.

The Special Rapporteurship on Economic, Social, Cultural and Environmental Rights (REDESCA) was
launched, including the conclusion of the selection process to appoint the Rapporteur and the start of
her activities. A Coordination Room was implemented to look for timely and coordinated answers to
human rights situations in the region, which led to integrated actions for Venezuela, Honduras,
Guatemala, and other countries. An onsite visit was made to Guatemala in order to gather information
about the human rights situation in the country and to make recommendations. The creation and launch
of the IACHR-OHCHR Joint Action Mechanism to Contribute to the Protection of Human Rights Defenders
in the Americas, with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), is
noteworthy. Finally, human rights training and promotion efforts were broadened, in particular with the
holding of the First Forum of the Inter-American Human Rights System. This progress has been possible
owing to measures aimed at fine-tuning institutional management, in the framework of the IACHR
Strategic Plan for 2017-2021.

Results achieved by the IACHR

Case and petition system:
o      Case processing backlog declined by 10% compared to the preceding year.
o      Processing Unit and the implementation of multiple measures aimed at speeding up the
       processing of petitions and cases.

       with Disabilities.
o      REDESCA was established with the implementation of the public merit-based bidding for
       selecting the Special Rapporteur.
o      Implementation of the Coordination Room for a timely and rapid response to situations of risk
       and human rights violations.
o      Drawing up and launching, with the OHCHR, the Joint Action Mechanism to contribute to the
       Protection of Human Rights Defenders in the Americas.
o      Onsite visit to Guatemala.

3.3   ADMINISTRATIVE TRIBUNAL

The Administrative Tribunal of the OAS is an autonomous body established by the General Assembly via
resolution AG/RES.35 de 1971, for the purpose of learning about disputes arising between the General
Secretariat and its staff for alleged failures to meet the terms of the staff or because of infringement of
the General Standards to Govern the Operations of the General Secretariat of the OAS and other
applicable provisions. In 2017, the Administrative Tribunal was comprised of the following judges:
Homero Bibiloni, President (Argentina); Michel Bastarache, Vice-President (Canada); Héctor Arce (Bolivia);
Magali Rojas (Peru); Wilson Vallejo (Ecuador); and T. Michael Peay (United States).

Summary of the Administrative Tribunal’s achievements

On January 24, 2017, the Administrative Tribunal celebrated the 45th anniversary of its operations, after
having settled more than 300 labor disputes in connection with severance, benefits, appointment and
selection, job classifications, retirement, and pensions, institutional parity and performance evaluations,
among other issues.

During the period covered in the present report, the Administrative Tribunal undertook a follow-up on
the process of implementing Judgment 165 adopted on December 29, 2016 in the framework of Appeal
304 Sergio Pino v. Secretary General. This judgment instructed the implementation of a new competitive
bidding process for selecting the Organization’s Human Resources Director, for which the Tribunal stayed
in contact periodically with the General Secretariat to learn about the activities that were programmed
and the deadlines set to carry out this process, and with the Staff Committee to learn about the scope of
its participation in it.

The Administrative Tribunal also promoted other activities aimed at: preventing internal conflicts:
strengthening its inter-agency cooperation ties; and recognizing its independence as an autonomous
body of the Organization, among which the following are noteworthy:

Holding a dialogue with the representatives of the various formal and informal mechanisms to prevent
or settle labor disputes in the Organization and the areas that are involved in these cross-cutting
proceedings. This pioneer dialogue was ultimately aimed at evaluating options for the efficient
consolidation and transmission of recommendations that are made by each one of the bodies convened
in order to facilitate their follow-up and, to that end, to identify the factors that could impact the
Organization’s working environment.

Participating in conferences and cooperation activities with the Administrative Tribunals of other
international organizations for the exchange of information about legal issues relative to international
administrative law and procedural matters. The synergies created with the Administrative Tribunals of
the Inter-American Development Bank, the World Bank, and the International Monetary Fund, with
which many bilateral meetings were held, are noteworthy.

Intervention in the political bodies of the Organization to request the regularization of its budget
situation, which led to the suspension of the duties under its jurisdiction during the second semester of
the year. As a result of the steps promoted by the Tribunal, in 2017, the General Assembly of the OAS, at
its fifty-second special session, set a suitable budget allocation for the annual operations of the Tribunal
[Resolution AG/RES. 1 (LII-E/17)].

the criteria that shall be nourishing the new search engine for decisions to be implemented.

3.4     INTER-AMERICAN CHILDREN’S INSTITUTE (IIN)

Summary of IIN’s achievements

The activities carried out by the IIN in 2017 used the roadmap of the Plan of Action for 2015-2019
adopted at the 90th regular meeting of the Directing Council (Antigua, Guatemala, 2015). The Plan
contains the lines of action, targets of each line for the period, and activities pledged for 2017. There
were 94, of which 61 materialized, 25 are under way, 6 are being coordinated, and 2 were postponed to
2018.

During the period covering the present report, the 90 years of IIN were celebrated, which was an
opportunity to highlight the institution’s action and reasserts its validity as an instrument of the inter-
American system to promote and protect the rights of children and adolescents in the region. The
Permanent Council’s adoption of June 9 as Americas Children and Youth Day constitutes a concrete
achievement in this direction.

The 92nd regular meeting of the IIN’s Directing Council was held in Bridgetown, Barbados, and this was
the first time that the Directing Council was meeting in a Caribbean country. As a result a major step was
taken for the benefit of regional integration. Because of the work to prepare for this meeting, today the
IIN has direct contact with the authorities in charge of childhood in the 14 Caribbean states.

One of the most noteworthy achievements is the repositioning of the IIN as a benchmark institution in
terms of policies for children and adolescents in the region. Communication increased with states on the
basis of requests for technical assistance and participation in activities proposed by the IIN. Globally, ties
were consolidated with the United Nations System through the Committee on the Rights of the Child and
the Office of the UN Special Representative of the Secretary General on Violence against Children. At the
subregional level, technical assistance was provided to the Commission Niñ@sur with those who have
built a permanent tie.

Results achieved by IIN

Elimination of violence in daily environments:

        “Best practices” were identified in four subregions (Canada, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Saint Lucia,
        and Uruguay). Agreements were entered into with strategic partners (SOS Children’s Villages and
        the Marist Federation) in order to ensure further in-depth analysis, systematize experiences, and
        draw lessons from what is in the process of being implemented.

        Agreements were entered into with various civil society organizations, which made it possible to
        join efforts to work on themes such as: building healthy environments; safe use of Internet; help
        lines, and banning of corporal punishment by law.

        It was agreed, with the organization SOS Children’s Villages, to develop the contents for a course
        on “Violence and the rights of children and adolescents… Building environments of peace,”
        which received 1,300 applicants and for which 78 technical civil servants of the states and civil
        society organizations were admitted.

Early childhood

           Training was provided to 41 civil servants from agencies working for children through the virtual
           course “Planning and managing comprehensive public policies for early childhood based on a
           rights perspective.”

           Working agreements were drawn up with the National Secretariat for Children and the Family
           (Republic of Argentina) to train and certify 120 civil servants of the Under-Secretariat for Early
           Childhood.

           Transfer of guidelines and support in Paraguay (COMPI) continued after having completed the
           development of a workshop on the issue “Healthy development in environments without
           violence.”

           The web and social media dissemination campaign “The Right of Children to a Family” was
           carried out on the basis of the IACHR document bearing the same name and contributions made
           by the states.4

Criminal liability of adolescents

           Work continued on an agreement with UNICEF to promote the wider use of non-custodial
           measures with adolescents who are criminal law offenders.

           A forum of dialogue was established with reference to states to identify progress and obstacles
           in implementing non-custodial measures.

           Inter-American Cooperation Program for the Prevention and Eradication of Sexual Exploitation
           and Smuggling of and Trafficking in Children and Adolescents

           In an agreement with the states of Chile, Colombia, and Uruguay, 98 civil servants were trained
           using onsite and online methodologies.

           The Office of the United Nations Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Violence
           against Children, UNICEF, and the IIN jointly presented a Note addressed to the states of
           Barbados, Saint Kitts and Nevis, and Trinidad and Tobago, to promote ratification of the Optional
           Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of Child on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and
           Child Pornography. The Note was sent via the Permanent Missions to the United Nations (May
           2017) and the Permanent Missions to the OAS (June 2017).

           IIN’s participation in the Regional Action Group of the Americas (GARA) to Prevent Sexual
           Exploitation of Children and Adolescents in Travel and Tourism was consolidated.

           The network of technical focal points was given impetus. There are designated technical focal
           points in 15 states: Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominica, the
           Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Mexico, Panama, Paraguay, and Saint
           Vincent and the Grenadines.

        The Project for “Guidelines for Empowering and Protecting Child and Adolescent Rights on the
        Internet in Central America and the Dominican Republic” was implemented jointly with SADYE of
        the OAS. This included the holding of inter-generational workshops in five countries with the
        participation of 94 children and adolescents and 84 adults, who made 158 recommendations in
        three areas: accessibility, capacity building of legal frameworks and institutions, and training for
        safe browsing.

        We continued working on providing technical assistance to the Central Authority of Mexico to
        develop its guide of procedures and to design, structure, and deliver a specific course aimed at
        operators working on this issue in Mexico.

        We developed the ninth version in Spanish of the Inter-American Course on the International
        Abduction of Children and Adolescents (SINNA), and at the request of the representatives of the
        Caribbean, the third edition of the course in English was prepared. There were 42 persons
        attending from the following countries: Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala,
        Mexico, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, and Uruguay.

Migrant Children and Adolescents

        Coordination was established with IOM to develop a virtual course on the rights of children and
        adolescents in situations of human mobility.

        A mapping of positive practices was developed in areas relative to the migration of children and
        adolescents, especially unaccompanied minors in order to promote horizontal and triangular
        cooperation.

        Coordination was established with the Committee on Migration Issues to promote the Inter-
        American Program in the matter.

Participation of children and adolescents

        A strong positioning of the states was achieved in the matter. This has led to many requests for
        technical assistance, human resources training, and support in processes for the consolidation of
        children and adolescent organizations.

        Follow-up on processes is currently being carried out in 12 states: Argentina, Brazil, Chile,
        Colombia, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Ecuador, Mexico, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, and Uruguay.

        Activities in the field in 10 states: Costa Rica, El Salvador, Dominican Republic, Panama,
        Honduras, Brazil, Paraguay, Colombia, Paraguay, and Uruguay.

        Technical assistance started up in Peru, Colombia, Mexico, Paraguay, and Uruguay.

        IIN/OAS organized seven activities with the participation of children and adolescents in
        Paraguay, Colombia, Chile, Peru, and Uruguay, involving 421 children from 17 countries of the
        region and Europe.

       At the request of Paraguay, a training proposal was developed with 36 operators from various
       public institutions.

       Participation of children and adolescents in institutional and planning areas of the IIN, as well as
       support to three states in the process of consultation on public policymaking cycles.

       The Network of Child and Adolescent Correspondents (RED CORIA) was established, comprised
       of 19 children and adolescents in 8 countries (Argentina, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Mexico,
       Paraguay, Trinidad and Tobago, and Uruguay). Two members of this network shall be
       representing the adolescents of the Americas at a meeting of the Committee on the Rights of the
       Child in Geneva.

Communication

       The following web page was redesigned: www.nuestravozacoloresiinoea.org

       Issues 3 and 4 of the newsletter Boletín IINfancia were published in English and Spanish.

       Social media were constantly being informed, awareness raised, and actions promoted for the
       benefit of the rights of the child. “Likes” on Facebook rose by 59.07 percent, followers on Twitter
       increased by 27%, and subscribers on our YouTube channel rose by 61%.

       In the framework of the commemoration of IIN’s 90th anniversary, there were two invitations
       launched to promote the participation of children and adolescents in the region: a call for stories
       “Rights should not be fairy tales” and a call for photographs “An Album of Rights” from which
       two digital publications emerged.

       Along with the National Secretariat for Children and Adolescents of Paraguay, the National
       Secretariat for Culture, the Organization of Ibero-American States, and the Inter-American
       Children’s Institute (IIN-OAS), a didactic guide or promotional primer of videos on the rights of
       children and adolescents was produced and declared by Paraguay as a project of educational
       interest.

3.5 INTER-AMERICAN COMMISSION OF WOMEN (CIM)

Summary of CIM’s achievements

The CIM’s work was consolidated with a series of mandates from various bodies, including its Assembly
of Delegates, the General Assembly of the OAS, and the Summits of the Americas. In 2016, the CIM’s
Assembly of Delegates adopted the Strategic Plan of the Inter-American Commission of Women for
2016-20215 which is aimed at strengthening the two primary roles of the Commission: acting as a
hemispheric policy forum for women’s rights and gender equality, and providing technical advisory
services for the institutional mainstreaming of the gender equality approach in the work of the OAS. The
Plan steers the Commission’s work in its two main strategic areas: (i) promoting gender equality and the
elimination of discrimination; and (ii) preventing and punishing violence against women.

3.6 INTER-AMERICAN TELECOMMUNICATION COMMISSION (CITEL)

Summary of CITEL’s main achievements

CITEL continued to boost the efforts to align the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) with the
Secretary General’s Strategic Initiatives and with the priorities identified by the member states of
CITEL/OAS. This has been used to draft the new Strategic Plan for 2018-2022 to be approved at the
Seventh Regular Meeting of the CITEL Assembly. As for the United Nations International
Telecommunication Union (ITU), CITEL upgraded its priorities and viewpoints in terms of the
development of telecommunications, for the purpose of ensuring that they are part of the world agenda.
The structuring of training and education impacting the member states of CITEL/OAS has multiplied, with
the provision of 10 distance learning courses and 3 classroom courses, with the granting of 183
scholarships to citizens of OAS member states, rising from 99 in 2015 to 134 in 2016.

As for the appropriation of technologies, CITEL continued to promote the inclusion and appropriation of
telecommunications/ICTs in the Americas, through the 2030 ICT Alliance of the Americas, securing
resources and concrete products that contribute to increasing connectivity and improving digital training
to upgrade the quality of education in the Americas and to develop talent for the new digital economy.

Results achieved by CITEL

There were 29 inter-American proposals that were incorporated into the World Telecommunication
Development Conference (WTDC-17), under the slogan “ICTs for the Sustainable Development Goals”
aimed at speeding up the expansion and use of telecommunication and ICT infrastructure, applications,
and services to build and continue developing the information society and to bridge the digital divide.
Likewise, 5 Regional Initiatives for the Hemisphere were adopted: disaster risk reduction; spectrum
management and the switchover to digital broadcasting; rollout of broadband infrastructure;
accessibility and affordability for inclusive and sustainable Americas; and development of the digital
economy, smart cities and communities, and the Internet of Things, and the promotion of innovation.

3.7 OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL (OIG)

Summary of OIG’s achievements

The Office of the Inspector General (OIG) is the agency responsible for discharging the duties of financial,
administrative, and operational auditing, for the purpose of ascertaining the degree of compliance by the
General Secretariat (GS).

Results achieved by OIG

o       Audits
        In 2017, nine audits were conducted, including: travel expenses; corporate credit card program;
        cultural heritage project, Phase II; staff transfers, competitive recruitment, and reclassifications;
        project monitoring; La Plata Basin project; supply processes for electoral observation missions;
        personal data protection, and the Judicial Facilitators Program.

o       Recommendations
        42% of the audit recommendations from previous years were addressed by the Administration.
        There were 11 new recommendations added over the year. The CAAP, via its Working Group on
        the Review of OAS Programs, continued to provide its steady support to the process of
        monitoring the recommendations made by the OIG and remained actively involved. At the end
        of the year, there were 66 audit recommendations that remained open, out of the 95 made in
        2016.

o       Investigations
        The OIG completed five investigation cases carried out from previous years and 12 that were
        received in 2017. This accounted for an increase of 11 cases concluded or +183%, compared to
        2016. The distribution of cases was as follows: eight for alleged misconduct; four for workplace
        harassment; four for ensuring organizational value; and one for protecting whistleblowers
        against retaliation.

o       Other activities
        The Organization filled the vacancy of the Inspector General on July 17, 2017. In addition, the
        OIG continued:
        (1) to monitor and assess anomalies that might suggest organizational risk; (2) to carry out its
        continuing professional education program for OIG staff; (3) to participate as observer on various
        committees of the General Secretariat; and (4) to meet and submit reports to the executive
        bodies of the OAS.

3.8     BOARD OF EXTERNAL AUDITORS

According to resolution AG/RES. 123 of the General Assembly (III-O/73), adopted in April 1973, and
resolution CP/Res. 124 of the Permanent Council of June 1975, the Board of External Auditors is the body
responsible for the external auditing of the accounts of the GS/OAS.

Summary of the achievements of the Board of External Auditors

The Board held its annual meeting on April 10 to 21, 2017, to prepare its report on the external auditing
of the accounts and comparative financial statements of the GS/PAS for the years ending on December
31, 2016 and 2015.

Results achieved by the Board of External Auditors

On May 17, 2017, the Board submitted its observations to the Permanent Council (OEA/Ser.S
JAE/doc.47/17 of May 9, 2017). The report includes four sections: a) Report of the Board of External
Auditors; b) financial statements of the OAS; c) financial statements of OAS-related entities and agencies;
and d) OAS Retirement and Pension Fund. On the basis of the unqualified opinions issued by BDO, LLP,
the financial statements pertaining to the entities that were audited tally with the books, documents,
and receipts of the GS/OAS.

        In short, the recommendations were as follows:

        1.      That financial and other kinds of measures be reviewed.
        2.      That the General Assembly adopt a Strategic Plan with the targets, activities, indicators,
                and costs related to the budgets for 2018, 2019, and 2020 and to the administrative and
                infrastructure needs of the OAS.
        3.      That a Subfund replenishment plan be drawn up to reach the amounts required in
                accordance with the General Standards.
        4.      That consideration should be given to allocating all surpluses from the ICR fund to
                administrative, maintenance, and infrastructure needs.
        5.      That the CAAP must finalize the Real Estate Strategy and that the General Assembly
                should approve it.
        6.      That a human resources strategy be draw up that would include plans to fill vacant
                positions and evaluate the optimal mix of permanent staff and contractors.
        7.      That a “staff management committee” be established, chaired by the Assistant Secretary
                General and comprised of other senior staff.
        8.      That the Board recommend that member states should finance a sustainable
                corporation business system.
        9.      That a funding strategy be drawn up to support the Strategic Development Plan of
                SAF/DOITS.
        10.     That the OIG must use a risk-based approach to select audits that focus specifically on
                securing the highest benefits from the efforts exerted.
        11.     That the OIG must review all open auditing recommendations, re-evaluate the criteria
                used to classify them as high, moderate, or low risk, and immediately bring to a close
                those that management had decided have been adequately settled or those that are no
                longer valid.

4. SPECIALIZED ENTITIES AND AGENCIES

4.1 INTER-AMERICAN DEFENSE BOARD (IADB)

The Inter-American Defense Board (IADB) was founded on March 30, 1942. In 2006, the General
Assembly of the Organization of American States (OAS) established the IADB as an “entity” of the
Organization and adopted its Statute. The IADB currently has 27 member states and 7 observer states,
and its structure is comprised of the Council of Delegates, the Secretariat, and the Inter-American
Defense College (IADC). Its purpose is to provide the OAS and its member states with technical,
consultative, and education advice on matters related to military and defense issues in the Hemisphere.

Summary of IADB’s achievements

It should be highlighted that, on March 30, 2017, the IADB celebrated 75 years. The ceremony
celebrating its anniversary was attended by distinguished guests such as the President of the Republic of
Honduras, the Assistant Secretary General of the OAS, the Secretaries of Defense and Navy of Mexico,
the Commander of the United States Northern Command, and the Secretary General of the Ministry of
Defense of Brazil.

As for the Inter-American Defense College, it celebrated its 55th anniversary on October 26 and 27, with
the attendance of OAS ambassadors, representatives of the Council of Delegates, and alumni.

Results achieved by the IADB

Linkage with hemispheric, regional, subregional, or service organizations:

        Participation in the XXXII Conference of American Armies (CAA), the specialized meetings on
        Inter-operability (CNIE-I) and Telecommunication (CNI-EC) of the XI Inter-American Naval
        Conference (CNI), the Conference of American Air Force Chiefs (CONJEFAMER), as well as the
        conferences sponsored by United States Southern Command: the South American Defense
        Conference (SOUTHDEC), the Central American Security Conference (CENTSEC), and the
        Caribbean Nations Security Conference (CANSEC), as well as the Conference of Central American
        Armed Forces (CFAC) and the Meeting of Public Security Ministers of the Americas (MISPA).

        Consolidation of ties with the Strategic Studies Centers on Defense and Security, such as the
        Perry Center, the National Academy of Political and Strategic Studies (ANEPE) of Chile, Advanced
        Strategic Studies School (CAEE) of El Salvador, the National Advanced Studies Center (CAEN) of
        Peru, the Regional Center of Strategic Studies on Security (CREES) of Colombia, the National
        Defense School (FADENA) of Argentina, among others, which made it possible to support the
        events and studies conducted by IADB on aspects of interest for security and defense in the
        Hemisphere.

Humanitarian demining

        Support continued to be provided to the OAS Comprehensive Action against Anti-Personnel
        Mines Program (AICMA) in Colombia through the Group of Inter-American Monitors in Colombia
        (GMI-CO), which focuses on monitoring and evaluating the humanitarian demining courses in
        Colombia, as well as on their documentary and operational assessment.

                                                 - 109 -



        The IADB continues to support the General Command of the Armed Forces of Colombia with the
        Inter-American Technical Advisory Group in Colombia (GATI-CO), by supporting training activities
        for the military monitors of humanitarian demining in the country.

        Ten representatives from various countries of the continent were sent to the “Course on
        Demining and Defusing Devices” provided by the Kingdom of Spain.

        IADB attended the 20th Annual International Meeting of National Anti-Mine Action Program
        Directors and United Nations Advisers in Geneva, Switzerland, and the Seminar on Demining War
        Zones: Opening Space for Building Peace, of the U.S. Institute for Peace in Washington, D.C.

XIII Conference of the Defense Ministers of the Americas (CMDA):

        In 2017, support was provided to the Pro tempore Secretariat for the development of the
        thematic areas relative to the evolution of the armed forces in defense and security issues;
        humanitarian assistance in emergencies; climate change; and the gender perspective. IADB
        contributes by participating in events and organizing seminars to draw up proposals that are
        useful for the coordination, ways, and means to address these thematic areas.

        IADB continues to integrate the institutional memory of this Conference, which shall be used as
        an excellent source of consultation about the achievements made to date by this important
        hemispheric forum.

Natural disasters:

        Natural disasters, climate change, and humanitarian aid in the Hemisphere were monitored.

        Advisory services and coordination were provided to address the impacts left by Hurricanes
        Harvey, Irma, José, and María in the Caribbean, with special attention focused on the request for
        support from Antigua and Barbuda, as a result of the damage sustained because of Hurricane
        Irma, helping various member countries to agree to provide assistance to that country in keeping
        with their capabilities. At the same time, there was a follow-up on the impacts of the
        earthquakes that hit Mexico.

        The seminar “Inter-Agency Coordination for Large-Scale Disasters in the Americas” was
        organized and, with both the CSH and other international organizations, it attended the seminar
        to provide advisory services on how to use of defense and security capacities to mitigate the
        impacts of these phenomena.

Confidence and Security Building Measures in the Americas

        IADB contributed actively to developing the Seventh Forum on Confidence- and Security-Building
        Measures (CSBMs) held at the SMS of the OAS, where the IADB presented subjects relative to
        the updated CSBM database and the draft electronic form for providing information on this
        subject.
-----------------------Page 112 End-----------------------

                                                 - 110 -


       Two workshops were held on CSBMs to present the platform of the electronic form and how it
       operates. This tool is considered to be useful to speed up the remittance of data referring to
       transparency and confidence-building measures.

       Furthermore, at the behest of the OAS, the IADB organized the Forum: “Strengthening the Inter-
       American Convention on Transparency in Conventional Weapons Acquisition,” for the purpose of
       making recommendations that would make it possible to motivate the participation of member
       states in this Convention. These recommendations were submitted to the CSH.

       “The Reference Manual on Small Arms and Light Weapons” was drafted and disseminated in
       order to contribute to the marking, gathering, storing, and destruction of this type of weapon.

New threats and other military and defense aspects:

       The Seminar on the “Armed Forces and their participation in nontraditional tasks and emergency
       threats” was held in order to examine the coordination and cooperation required to tackle
       threats such as organized crime, socioeconomic threats, cyber-war, among others.

       With the Perry Center, IADB participated in the project on “Prospects of the Armed Forces up to
       2030.”

       In terms of gender equity, the Conference on the participation of women in defense and security
       affairs was organized in order to invite member states to continue promoting concrete policies
       and actions in this matter.

       Likewise, it participated in the CMDA Ad Hoc Group on the “Progressive Mainstreaming of the
       Gender Perspective as a Cross-Cutting Issue for Defense and Security Policies” held in Panama
       and in the seminar on “Women’s Participation in the World’s Armed Forces,” which was held in
       Mexico.

Education

       The Inter-American Defense College (IADC) completed its third year as an institution accredited
       to award master’s degrees. The consolidation of the accreditation meets the key requirements
       of eligibility for access to funding for scholarships from the OAS, and efforts continue to be made
       with the OAS to achieve this purpose.

       The Master of Science degree on inter-American security and defense is an effort made by the
       IADC to achieve academic excellence and rigor in teaching, focusing on the framework of
       multidimensional security and the cross-cutting elements of the four pillars of the OAS.
       Academic freedom is imperative. The core subjects include international relations and the inter-
       American system; strategic thinking for hemispheric defense and security; political economics for
       defense and security, multidimensional security in the Americas, hemispheric policy for defense
       and security; and dispute analysis and settlement.

       The academic achievements in 2017 were as follows:
       Graduating class No. 56 had 64 members graduating in June 2017. This graduating class
       represented 17 countries of the OAS and included 49 servicemen; 10 police officers; and five
       civilians, among which there were nine women.

4.2 INTER-AMERICAN INSTITUTE FOR COOPERATION ON AGRICULTURE (IICA)

Summary of IICA achievements

The Institute, which is a specialized agency of the inter-American system, is aimed at promoting
agricultural development and the rural well-being of the Americas. The year 2017, marked by the
celebration of its 75th anniversary, was abundant in terms of harvesting results.

IICA implemented its cooperation agenda on the basis of 54 initiatives in which budgeted quota
contributions were invested throughout the year, with the following breakdown: four flagship projects
(competitiveness of chains, resilience and climate change, inclusion, and family agriculture); an
agricultural and livestock health strategy and food safety; three multinational projects on innovation,
bio-inputs, and added value; 12 regional integration mechanisms; and 34 national rapid response
actions. This is supplemented with a portfolio of 195 initiatives, whose annual implementation amounts
to over US$140 million coming from many partners: governments, donors, the academic sector, and
multilateral banks.

Results achieved by IICA

       Modernization of institutional frameworks for the management of agricultural services
       associated with public policymaking, research, outreach, health, marketing and information for
       national development was promoted. Regional integration and the exchange of knowledge
       between countries, for which IICA acted as a bridge for South-South cooperation, were
       promoted.

       More than a dozen agricultural innovations materialized with public institutionality, for the
       benefit of at least 15 chains of production of interest for Latin America and the Caribbean, such
       as those for biofuels, bio-inputs, coffee, cocoa, root vegetables and tubers, staple grains, wheat,
       and soybean.

       The 34 member countries of the Institute addressed on a timely basis their plant and animal
       health situations, owing to their participation in international forums, the development of
       public-private partnerships and training processes on regulatory frameworks, the Codex
       Alimentarius, pests and diseases, among other issues, for the benefit of more than 5,000
       stakeholders.

       In eight countries, management capacities were enhanced in 10 chains of farm production, by
       the application of criteria to increase competitiveness, sustainability, and inclusion and the use
       of a series of instruments developed by the IICA. This benefited close to 5,000 stakeholders,
       including civil servants, businesspersons, and producers.

       Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Guatemala, Guyana, Honduras, Mexico, Peru, and
       Suriname, among other countries, implemented institutional and operational frameworks using
       a participatory approach to promote inclusive development and family agriculture. At least 10
       countries benefited from the initiatives to promote women’s inclusion and development in the
       agricultural sector.

                                               - 115 -


       With support from IICA, 12 countries enhanced their capacities to plan climate change
       adaptation processes in the agricultural sector, whereas others, hit by Hurricanes Irma and
       María, drafted recovery projects and risk management strategies.

       In the framework of the program “100 CONACYT-IICA Scholarships,” 327 new scholarship
       beneficiaries are studying for a master’s degree or doctorate in Mexican universities, which is
       three times the target number that had been planned.

       There were 6,643 persons participating in the IICA’s virtual courses, whereas in the massive
       courses organized with Mexican institutions, more than 30,000 persons were trained.

4.3 INTER-AMERICAN JURIDICAL COMMITTEE (CJI)

Summary of CJI’s achievements

In 2017, the Inter-American Juridical Committee held two regular periods of sessions at its headquarters
in the city of Rio de Janeiro, in Brazil, where it adopted two reports in fulfillment of the mandates of the
OAS General Assembly: one on “Conscious and Effective Regulation of Business in the Area of Human
Rights” (CJI/doc.522/17 rev. 2) and the other on “Protection of Cultural Heritage Assets” (CJI/doc.527/17
rev.2).

In the first, the Committee compiles best practices, legislation, and case law to address the subject and
proposes alternatives to move forward with the conscious and effective regulation of business. As for
the protection of cultural heritage assets, the Committee proposes consolidating domestic laws, urges
ratification of the 1970 UNESCO Convention and the 1976 OAS Convention, and invites all states to
establish cooperation mechanisms to facilitate the implementation of the above, on the basis of a review
of available instruments, both regional and universal. Furthermore, there was a pronouncement by the
Committee with respect to the immunity of states and statelessness.

In the period covered by the present report, the Committee approved, in addition, the consideration of
two new subjects: “validity of foreign judicial decisions in light of the Inter-American Convention on
extraterritorial validity of foreign judgments and arbitral awards” and “binding and non-binding
agreements.” The latter arose from an exchange carried out with the legal counsels of foreign affairs
ministries in October 2016. Furthermore, the plenary of the Juridical Committee decided to keep dealing
with the following subjects on its agenda: immunity of international organizations; law applicable to
international contracts; representative democracy; and guide for the application of the principle of
conventionality [review for compliance with human rights conventions].

As for the Chair of the Committee, he participated, in April, in a meeting of the Permanent Council and of
the Committee on Juridical and Political Affairs, which made it possible for him to meet permanent
representatives and delegates at OAS headquarters, where he stressed the importance of dialogue with
various political bodies and the feedback that is expected from states in order to follow up on the work
that they themselves have proposed to the Committee. He urged the Caribbean to participate more so
that they can integrate the common law perspective. He also highlighted the need for the states of that
region to take interest in participating in the Committee.

In August 2017, as in previous years, the Committee held its 44th edition of the Course on International
Law, with support from the International Law Department. This 44th Course took place between July 31
and August 18, 2017 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and was attended by 42 students, and of these 15 were
OAS-funded scholarship beneficiaries from various countries of the Hemisphere.

Finally, it is important to highlight the presence of representatives from various international
organizations during the Inter-American Juridical Committee’s period of sessions held in August. On that
occasion, the plenary of the Committee welcomed Commissioner Kathleen Quartey Ayensu, who was
visiting from the African Union Commission on International Law, as well as Dr. Paulo Abrão from the
Executive Secretariat of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR), Ambassador María
Teresa Infante on behalf of the Latin American Society of International Law (SLADI), Ambassador Marcelo
Vázquez as member of the United Nations International Law Commission, and Dr. Felipe Rotondo and
Dr. Edgardo Martínez Rojas, both representing the Ibero-American Network for Personal Data Protection
(RIDP).

4.4 PAN AMERICAN DEVELOPMENT FOUNDATION (PADF)

Summary of PADF’s achievements

Established in 1962, the Pan American Development Foundation (PADF) is a private, nonprofit,
nongovernmental institution that operates under a unique cooperation agreement concluded with the
OAS. The PADF’s mission is to implement development programs and help victims of natural disasters
and humanitarian crises in Latin America and the Caribbean. In 2017, we worked to respond to the
Hemisphere’s greatest challenges by providing innovative solutions facilitating sustainable progress for
the region.

In Colombia, in order to respond to the humanitarian crisis stemming from displacement and to endorse
the implementation of the country’s Victims Law, the PADF continued to broaden its programs to help
the population living in conditions of displacement, Afro-descendants, indigenous peoples, women
victims of domestic violence, young people at risk, and other vulnerable groups in the country. The
Positive Results Initiatives Program (Iniciativas con Balance Positivo) is noteworthy as it consists of its
own methodology to develop actions aimed at creating processes of self-management, empowerment,
social capital building, and promotion of a culture of legality in the community, on the basis of the
contributions from all stakeholders. In 2017, this initiative focused on the Going Back to the Countryside
campaign (Volver al Campo) in order to invest in peasant communities and the country’s farming sector.

In Haiti, where the PADF has been working for decades, the year 2017 witnessed the outcomes of two
major economic development initiatives: LEAD and Ann Booste Canaan. PADF worked directly with
micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises in key value chains and offered capital and technical
assistance. The PADF also provided training to young people so they could build up labor skills and gain
access to better jobs.

In 2017, we continued our actions in response to risk and for risk mitigation, whereas in countries like
Haiti, Guatemala, and El Salvador, we prepared communities for reducing the harmful impacts of natural
events. We also provided responses when these events occurred throughout the region. In Haiti, they
continued working in response to Hurricane Matthew which devastated the southern part of the island
in 2016. At the end of 2017, however, new fund raising was required to respond to the new hurricanes in
Haiti and Puerto Rico, as well as the earthquake in Mexico.

As part of its mandate with civil society in the region, the PADF continued strengthening independent
nongovernmental organizations without any political affiliations, as an inter-American instrument to
consolidate democratic values and principles on the basis of greater citizen participation in protecting
human rights. For example, in 2017, with support from the PADF and the OAS Special Rapporteurship for
Freedom of Expression, civil society organizations adopted common standards to monitor the situation
of freedom of expression in their countries.

The Foundation also continues to implement corporate social responsibility projects in various countries,
which facilitate greater contributions to integral development and the aid given to natural disaster
victims. In 2017, we broadened our program for education in science, technology, engineering, and
mathematics through our STEM in the Americas initiative, which supports STEM academies in schools
throughout the region to increase quality education in these areas and support teachers in charge of
teaching these subjects.

Results achieved by the PADF

o      PADF was able to reach 10.3 million persons in 16 countries on the basis of development and
       disaster-response programs.
o      PADF raised US$80 million in funding for development and disaster-response programs in Latin
       America and the Caribbean.
o      Working closely with the Colombian Government, the PADF directly impacted the quality of life
       of 260,000 victims of the conflict, including 8,270 returnee or relocated families, 20,226
       indigenous and Afro-Colombian households, and more than 3,000 displaced persons. With a
       total of 19 projects, these and other vulnerable groups, such as women victims of violence,
       children and young people at risk, among others, were provided with services.
o      More than 37,000 persons were supported in Guatemala and El Salvador thanks to local risk
       management actions, the delivery of first-aid kits and stretchers to municipal firemen, the
       mapping of vulnerabilities, and training in community resilience.
o      As a result of our economic development projects in Haiti, 1,810 new jobs were created leading
       to income earnings amounting to more than US$12.3 million.
o      As part of our response to Hurricane Matthew, 13,500 Haitians managed to gain access to clean
       water.
o      In the Bahamas, 1,113 adults and 903 children and adolescents participated in dialogues,
       advocacy activities, and campaigns to raise awareness about gender-based violence and the
       need to reduce all kinds of violence.
o      In Suriname, Trinidad and Tobago, and the Bahamas, 1,732 government, security, and justice
       officials received training on crime prevention strategies, while 11,154 young people participated
       in court simulations, traineeships, and other events to reduce factors contributing to the risk of
       criminality.
o      On the basis of various STEM education programs, the donation of school supplies, and the
       empowerment of young entrepreneurs, we brought benefits to almost 1,000 students in
       Argentina, Brazil, and Chile. At the same time, in our play-and-game centers (casas lúdicas) in
       Colombia we were able to reach another 12,000 young people.

4.5 PAN AMERICAN HEALTH ORGANIZATION (PAHO)

Summary of PAHO’s achievements

In the period 2013-2017, the Pan American Health Organization, which is the World Health
Organization’s Regional Office for the Americas, continued its national, subregional, and regional
technical cooperation activities, supporting health development in the countries. Technical cooperation
from PAHO during this period has mainly been steered by the PAHO Strategic Plan for 2014-2019, which
was drafted with the broad participation of member states. It also worked hand in hand with the WHO’s
General Programme of Work and the Millennium Development Goals in order to ensure PAHO’s
contribution to complying with these international agreements and frameworks.

In this period, PAHO gave priority to and developed successful actions in a wide range of basic issues,
steered by the resolutions approved by its executive bodies. Among those issues, the following are
noteworthy: capacity building of health system in terms of coverage and universal access; capacity
training in countries to respond to health-related emergencies and disasters and the reduction and
elimination, to the extent possible, of communicable diseases; and the prevention and control of non-
communicable diseases and their risk factors. The work used an approach encompassing the entire
course of life in health interventions, with special emphasis on the health of mothers, children, and
adolescents, as well as older persons, taking into consideration the importance of social and
environmental determinants for health and the prioritization of the most vulnerable groups. The fruitful
partnerships and collaborations with stakeholders of the inter-American system shall continue to play a
primary role in the Organization’s work and in the progress achieved by member states in ensuring
sustainable health development.
