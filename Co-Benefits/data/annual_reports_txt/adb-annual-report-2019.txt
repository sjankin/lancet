within and outside the region.
In 2019, in response to a request by the
Government of the PRC, ADB supported a series
of workshops to promote dialogue on aging,
technical and vocational education and training,
and rural vitalization. Participants from central
and provincial governments and academia shared
their knowledge and experiences to help identify
priorities for policy reform and investment
planning.
To assist the PRC’s National Development
and Reform Commission, ADB prepared
papers giving detailed research and policy

Such investment will help build economic

   INDEPENDENT EVALUATION

   ADB’s Independent Evaluation Department (IED) supports both accountability and
   learning. Its goal is to ensure that its evaluations are valued and used by stakeholders and
   decision-makers to bring about positive changes in perception, attitude, decision-making,
   and practice.

   In 2019, the IED produced 1 country evaluation, 2 sector evaluations, 3 corporate
   evaluations, and 10 project and technical assistance-level evaluations. It also validated
   55 project completion reports, 11 extended annual review reports, and 7 country
   partnership strategy final reviews.

   The IED completed a country program evaluation for Indonesia and validated country
   partnership strategy final reviews for Armenia, Bhutan, Cambodia, Fiji, Georgia, Nepal,
   and Thailand. The findings contributed to the preparation and design of new country
   partnership strategies and operational plans for these developing member countries.             This evaluation assesses the

   The department evaluated the relevance and results of the use of ADB’s concessional             by ADB over 2013–2018,
                                                                                                   the period covered by Asian

   The IED also assessed the performance and results of ADB’s use of multitranche
   financing facilities. These facilities have been used to deliver over $52 billion in ADB
   financing from 2005 to 2018. The evaluation supported the use of these facilities, but
   recommended changes to improve their transformational development impact, improve
   timely completion of operations, enhance learning, and reduce transaction costs.

   Sector-level evaluations examined ADB’s support for Pakistan’s power sector from
   2005 to 2017, which totaled $6.2 billion, and Indonesia’s finance sector from 2005
   to 2018, which totaled about $2 billion. These evaluations provided evidence to help
   ADB continue to improve project design, operations, and development outcomes. For
   example, a subsequent policy-based loan for Pakistan benefited from the evaluation’s
   recommendations to improve financial sustainability, strengthen sector governance and
   integrated planning, and support physical and technological investments. These became
   the program’s reform areas.
