                                  PART A:
                  HIGHLIGHTS OF THE ACTIVITIES OF THE UNION

INTRODUCTION

1.     On behalf of the Commission, as well as the Organs and Specialised Agencies of
the African Union, I have the honour to present the Annual Report on the Activities of
the Union and Its Organs for the period of January to December 2017, pursuant to the
decision of the Executive Council EX.CL./Dec.943(XXX) of January 2017.

2.     Since this is my first report as the Chairperson of the Commission, I would like to
extend my gratitude to the previous Commission and, especially, to its Chairperson Dr.
Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma, for the sterling accomplishments realized during her tenure,
which laid the groundwork for the activities of the Union and the Commission that I have
had the privilege of chairing since March 2017.

3.      At the outset, I would like to state that, since my assumption of office, I have
been guided by the ambitious Agenda of the Union (Agenda 2063), which indeed has
defined our roadmap towards a united, integrated, peaceful and prosperous Africa. I
also realize the challenges ahead of our Commission which has to strive and give its
best in achieving the set goals and aspirations during its tenure. The contribution
expected from our mandate running up to 2021 is to resolutely enhance the pace
of efficiency and effectiveness of this Commission, based on the priorities of the First
ten Year implementation Plan (FTYIP) and the targets of the Mid-Term Plan 2018-2023
which is being submitted to the endorsement of this very Summit.

4.     As a way of addressing the immediate challenges, I have been fully engaged, in
close     collaboration   with    all    Member      States,  strategic partners   and
other stakeholders concerned,        in    the    implementation     of our    flagship
project: “Silencing the guns by 2020”. Many commitments were made in this respect,
including the agreement reached with the UN Secretary General, Antonio Guterres,
through the Memorandum of Understanding signed in New York on
19 September 2017, as well as other partners, so as to pull together efforts aimed at
finding durable solutions to the crises in these regions.

5.      The Commission is keenly conscious that without peace and security on
the continent, no sustainable development can be achieved, which is also the priority of
Africa. Indeed, peace cannot be achieved without development and vice-versa.

6.     In the same vein, regional integration is key in pulling together resources for
sustainable development. That is why, tremendous efforts have been deployed during
the period under review, to push, in conjunction with H.E. President Mahamoudou
Issoufou, for the early establishment of the Continental Free Trade Area (CFTA),
together with the Single African Air Transport Market (SAATM). The Commission has
also promoted for the implementation of other flagship projects, including those related

                                                                       EX.CL/1061(XXXII)
                                                                                 Page 2

to infrastructure and energy, agriculture and environment, industrialization and socio-
economic transformation, health and education, to name just a few.

7.     The Commission also embarked on the reform process based on the relevant
Decision of the Assembly. To this end, I have established the Reform Implementation
Unit in my Office to follow through on all issues raised in the Decision. The Commission
will submit a full report on the activities undertaken, under the invaluable leadership
of President Paul Kagame and working closely with all Member States and other
stakeholders.

8.     The     Commission          is determined to interact with Member
States and in particular with the Permanent Representatives Committee (PRC), with
whom it held a fruitful retreat in December 2017 in Cairo, Egypt, in order to improve
working methods at all levels as well as undertake a thorough review of the African
Union Strategic partnerships, which should be in consonance with our Agenda 2063.

2017 HIGHLIGHTS

9.      In 2017, the proportion paid by Member States vs. partners to the budget showed
that progress towards greater financial self-reliance was being made and that the Union
was on track according to the AU Reform’s “Financing the Union” initiative. Indeed,
Member States’ contributions to the Programme budget have increased from 6% in
2016 to 15% in 2017, and are due to reach 37% in 2018. Member States have covered
100% of the operational budget. Member States contributed 45% of the Year 1 Target
for the Peace Fund in 2017.

10.     Activities focusing on the domestication of Agenda 2063 progressed steadily. So
far, forty Member States have started the domestication process. The implementation of
the flagship programmes and projects in the area of socio-economic development also
gained momentum albeit unevenly and with many uncompleted objectives.

11.   The report describes some notable advances, including in the following areas:

      i)     The Specialized Technical Committee on Finance, Monetary Affairs,
             Economic Planning and Integration has endorsed both the draft Agenda
             2063 monitoring and evaluation framework, and the draft domestic resource
             mobilization strategy. The Ministers have recommended both for the Policy
             Organs’ adoption at the January 2018 summit.

      ii)    At the time of finalizing this report, twenty-one (21) Member States were at
             different stages of implementation of the Kigali decision of June 2016 on
             financing the Union with domestic generated resources. A few others were
             working with the Commission to assess the implication of implementing the
             Kigali decision in light of their other global obligations.

      iii)   Tangible progress has been made on the integration agenda. Member
             States completed the negotiations on the Continental Free Trade Area in
-----------------------Page 5 End-----------------------

                                                                        EX.CL/1061(XXXII)
                                                                                  Page 3

             December 2017. The draft legal instruments were endorsed by the relevant
             STC and will be submitted to the Policy Organs for adoption at the January
             2018 summit.

      iv)    The number of Member States that have undertaken to implement the
             Yamoussoukro Decision on the Single Africa Air Transport Market has also
             increased, standing now at twenty-three (23).

      v)     On the free movement of people and the African passport, the draft Protocol
             on Free Movement of Persons in Africa will be available for the
             consideration of the Policy Organs at the January 2018 summit. Meanwhile,
             eight Member States have already introduced a 30-day visa on arrival
             privilege for all Africans. The Heads of State of the Communauté
             économique des Etats d’Afrique centrale (CEMAC) ratified in October 2017
             the CEMAC agreement on the free movement of their citizens in the
             CEMAC zone.

      vi)    Substantial progress was also made in the implementation of the Program
             for Infrastructure Development in Africa (PIDA). The ICT Priority Action Plan
             relating to internet exchange points was completed in thirty-three Member
             States. The NEPAD Agency’s technical and financial support to Member
             States and the RECs resulted in the completion of several regional
             infrastructure projects. Financial support from the German Federal
             Government enabled the strengthening of technical capacity for further
             implementation of PIDA projects.

      vii)   Collaboration between the Commission, the NEPAD Agency and the RECs
             continued to support Member States in the transport, energy, tourism and
             ICT sectors, to name but a few. Support was also given to Member States
             to facilitate the development of trade and customs policies in harmony with
             the CFTA agreement.

      viii) Several evolving projects were implemented in the ICT areas, including the
            operationalization of the dotAfrica domain name and the unveiling of a new
            set of Internet Infrastructure Security Guidelines for Africa during the Africa
            Internet Summit that was jointly organized by the Commission and the
            Internet Society in Nairobi from 30 May to 2 June 2017

12.    In the area of peace, stability and governance, substantial progress was made in
the operationalization of the African Governance Architecture (AGA) and in enhancing
its synergy with the African Peace and Security Architecture. Increased coordination
between the two architectures, in addition to greater collaboration between Member
States, the Commission and the RECs, enabled the African Union to improve its ability
to address peace, stability, elections and governance issues in a holistic manner in
several Member States.

13.  Significant progress has been made in developing conflict prevention
mechanisms, including the Continental Structural Conflict Prevention Framework, the

                                                                                   Page 4

launch of FemWise Africa, and the validation of the Draft AU Border Governance
strategy which is awaiting the endorsement by other Policy Organs. The AU Mechanism
for Police Cooperation (AFRIPOL) has also become fully operational and commenced
the implementation of its program of work. The inauguration of the Continental Logistics
Base for the African Standby Force in Douala, Cameroon, is also a milestone in the
operationalization of the APSA.

14.    The African continent continued to grapple with a range of transnational security
threats, including the ramifications of global security developments. Terrorism has taken
on greater proportions and expanded geographically, with the 2017 year being marked
by some of the deadliest terrorist attacks ever witnessed on the continent. In response,
actions were taken, through the Commission and specific regional security
arrangements, to degrade the capability of terrorist and criminal groups in Somalia, the
Lake Chad Basin and in the Sahel region.

15.     With the adoption, in early 2017, of the AU Master Roadmap of Practical Steps to
Silence the Guns in Africa by 2020, the Policy Organs placed more emphasis on
controlling illicit proliferation, circulation and trafficking of arms and ammunition, which
are considered the main tools and enablers of violence on the continent. In this regard,
the Commission appointed Mr. Ramtane Lamamra of Algeria as High Representative of
the AU for Silencing the Guns to take the agenda forward. Nonetheless, a strong
political will supported by robust efforts are required on the part of Member States to
effectively and sustainably address this problem.

16.    Efforts continued throughout the year to accelerate the implementation of the
decision of the Policy Organs on the promotion and protection of African and
international human rights instruments, with special attention paid to the rights of
women and children. However, more cooperation is still needed from Member States to
strengthen these instruments, as well as with the AU Organs that are mandated to
implement them.

17.    Presidential and legislative elections were held in a generally peaceful,
transparent, free and fair environment on the continent. The Commission deployed
short and long-term observation missions to all Member States that held elections this
year. It also provided technical assistance to national electoral management bodies
(EMBs) to help them build capacity and develop appropriate strategies for managing
peaceful and credible elections.

18.    The quality of elections and the credibility of their outcome generally improved in
2017. However, serious challenges remained, including the enduring lack of adequate
funding from national sources, and contestations over the impartiality of the EMBs and
the judiciary institutions responsible for adjudicating electoral disputes.

19.     Young people from all over the continent took part in the launch of the 2017
theme, Harnessing the Demographic Dividend through Investment in the Youth. They
contributed to the development of the AU Demographic Dividend Roadmap which
they delivered to the Assembly. On their part, Member States, the Commission and
other AU Organs initiated several activities during the year that provided a platform for
young Africans to share their experience and discuss ways to increase their
participation in the work of the Union and involvement in harnessing the demographic
dividend. At the level of Member States, only Burundi, the Republic of Congo, Ghana,
Guinea, Nigeria and Sierra Leone launched the theme of the year countrywide.

20.     2017 was also the year of substantial progress in the number of Treaty
ratifications. Eighteen new signatures were appended to OAU/AU Treaties, and forty
new instruments of ratification were deposited with the Commission. The Commission
was also in the process of registering ten OAU/AU Treaties with the United Nations
Secretariat in line with Article 102 of the United Nations Charter. Progress was also
achieved in the implementation of the decisions of the Policy Organs on the
International Criminal Court (ICC) and the Hissène Habré trial as well as the
establishment of the Hybrid Court for South Sudan.

21.    Member States’ implementation of the Malabo-CAADP (Comprehensive Africa
Agriculture Development Programme) Results Framework gathered momentum in
2017. In collaboration with the NEPAD Planning and Coordination Agency, the RECs,
relevant AU agencies and other technical partners, the Commission facilitated the
development of the first Continental Biennial Review Report, which was endorsed by
the relevant STC. The report will be presented at the January 2018 Summit.

22.     In addition to engaging with the youth on the Theme of the year, the
Commission and other AU Organs carried out several sectoral activities in respect of
the rights to education and health for all, particularly women, the youth and persons
living with disabilities.

                                                                         EX.CL/1061(XXXII)
                                                                                   Page 6


23.     Strengthening collaboration with the private sector remains a strategic priority for
the African Union. The Commission worked with various private sector partners to set
up the African Business Council and convene the first trade policy dialogue. Contacts
are also ongoing with the Pan-African Chambers of Commerce and Industry. The
objective in 2018 is to establish the Pan-African Trade Observatory, which will serve as
a repository of information on trade and industry in Africa.

24.     Illegal migration by young African people remains an open wound for the
continent and is a stark reminder of the urgency of renewed efforts to address the
related challenges of employment and opportunities. Following the Assembly’s
declaration on migration – Assembly/AU/Decl.6 (XXV) – the Commission revised the AU
migration policy framework and prepared a draft plan of action, which were
subsequently endorsed by the relevant STC. Additionally, the draft protocol on the free
movement of persons was endorsed by the relevant STCs. It will be submitted to the
Policy Organs at the January 2018 summit.

25.    The Commission carried out a review of the current gender policy, which was
adopted in 2009, and developed a new AU gender equality and women’s empowerment
strategy that will be submitted to the STC on Gender Equality and Women’s
Empowerment in 2018.

26.    In compliance with their obligations under the Solemn Declaration on Gender
Equality and Women’s Empowerment, Member States submitted twenty-eight reports
during the period under review. As regards the Maputo Protocol, thirty-nine Member
States have ratified it to date.

27.     The AU Campaign to end child marriage is gathering momentum. In 2017,
twenty-one Member States have now launched it. Some have also enacted national
legislation and mechanisms to protect the girl child and outlaw child marriage.

28.    With respect to the protection of other vulnerable groups, the draft Protocol to the
African Charter on Human and People’s Rights on the Rights of Persons with
Disabilities in Africa was endorsed by the STC on Justice and Legal Matters. It will be
submitted for the Policy Organs’ consideration at the January 2018 Summit. However,
more signatures and ratifications are needed for the Protocol on the Rights of Older
Persons to enter into force.

29.      Efforts continued towards rebranding the African Union and increasing its
visibility on the continent and elsewhere. The year 2017 witnessed an increase in civil
society’s engagement with the African Union, as well as an improvement in the AU
engagement with the African diaspora. Projects were launched in order to support
diaspora programs in Member States and diaspora networks in the Caribbean, the Gulf
and Australia. The Commission established the Steering Committee of the Interfaith
Dialogue Forum as way to engage more fruitfully faith-based communities in Africa in
the work of the Union. In addition, the implementation of the Encyclopaedia Africana
Project is ongoing.

30.    Accreditation to the African Union continued, standing at one hundred and ten
non-African states and international organizations altogether. Concrete steps were
taken to reform the AU governance of partnerships and the institutional capacity of the
Commission to implement the new partnership strategy. Meanwhile, the AU
representational missions continued to enhance their efforts.

31.     In addition to the initiatives described in this report on the relations between the
Commission, the RECs and other AU Organs, the Chairperson of the Commission met
in July, August and November, with the Chief Executive Officers of the RECs and
Regional Mechanisms to discuss issues of common interest. Steps are being taken to
ensure greater synchronization between the AU and the RECs in line with Agenda
2063.

strategic partnerships.

PREPARATIONS FOR 2018-2023 MEDIUM-TERM PLAN

35.    The Commission finalized its Medium-Term Plan 2018-2023. Efforts are

                       THE COMMISSION, AU ORGANS AND
                            SPECIALIZED AGENCIES

                           OUTCOME 1:
     DEMOCRACY, HUMAN RIGHTS, GOVERNANCE, PEACE AND STABILITY

1.    Peace and stability, good governance, democracy and human rights as
foundations for development and stable societies promoted.

OUTPUTS:

          Capacity for conflict prevention, management, response and peacebuilding
           in place.

          Participation of women, youth, civil society in peace building, conflict
           prevention and post-conflict recovery and development facilitated.

          Post-conflict reconstruction and peace building mechanisms enhanced.

          Good governance and democracy promoted.

          Legal and shared values instruments, based on African and universal
           instruments, promoted.

          Capacity of Africa to coordinate and respond to humanitarian situations and
           protect civilians in conflicts and disaster zones enhanced.

Output 1: Capacity for conflict prevention, management, response and
          peacebuilding in place

2.     During the reporting period, the Commission achieved substantial progress in the
operationalization of the African Governance Architecture (AGA) and in enhancing its
synergy with the African Peace and Security Architecture (APSA). Increased
coordination and collaboration between the two architectures enabled the African Union
to strengthen its capacity for conflict prevention and mitigation, and better address
democratic governance issues on the continent.

3.     Conceived as a mechanism for dialogue among Member States, civil society and
other stakeholders, the African Governance Architecture has, through its Platform,
continued to facilitate citizen engagement with the African Union. Comparative
experiences and best practices sharing forums were among the tools used to improve
democratic governance on the continent. Such forums included the annual High-Level
Dialogue on Democracy, Human Rights and Governance in Africa and its pre-forums,

                                                                       EX.CL/1061(XXXII)
                                                                                Page 11

as well as the institutionalization of social media platforms for virtual citizen
engagement. The Commission, through the Department of Political Affairs, which
serves as the AGA Secretariat, handled around 78,300 Twitter followers and continuous
debates and discussions on democratic governance in Africa, particularly through the
#DGTrends hashtag.

4.     The Commission also carried out several activities aimed at strengthening the
AGA’s structures and improving their methods of work. During AGA statutory meetings
convened in May-June 2017, participants reviewed the 2014-2016 AGA workplan and
assessed its achievements, challenges and prospects for future consolidation. They
also endorsed proposals by the AGA Secretariat to develop the AGA Roadmap for the
2018-2020 period. Similarly, the new Bureau of the AGA Platform, which was elected in
2017, is expected to endorse these proposals and adopt the internal evaluation
guideline for state reports on the implementation of the African Charter on Democracy,
Elections and Governance (ACDEG).

5.     Efforts to operationalize the State Reporting Mechanism under the African
Charter on Democracy, Elections and Governance continued with the development of
internal review guidelines for State Parties’ initial reports. The report’s evaluation
process will commence as soon as the internal review guidelines are endorsed.
Meanwhile, the Republic of Togo has been the first Member State to submit its report on
the implementation of the African Charter on Democracy, Elections and Governance.
The Commission congratulates the Government of Togo for this milestone and
encourages other Member States to follow suit, thus demonstrating their commitment to
the strengthening of the African Governance Architecture.

6.     In order to strengthen cooperation with Regional Economic Communities (RECs)
on the ratification, domestication, implementation and reporting on the African Charter
on Democracy, Elections and Governance, AGA Platform members reviewed the
findings of the Scooping Comparative Study of the Charter and similar instruments at
the level of the RECs. They also worked on a draft framework for cooperation between
the Commission and the RECs on the implementation of the Charter at the regional and
continental levels.

7.     In furtherance of the implementation of the African Peace and Security
Architecture and its synergy with the African Governance Architecture in the promotion
of peace, security and stability in Africa, the Commission intensified its efforts towards
silencing the guns by the year 2020, in line with the letter and spirit of the AU Solemn
Declaration adopted by the Assembly on 25 May 2013. More efforts were geared
towards addressing emerging threats to peace and security, particularly terrorism,
violent extremism, insecurity in Africa’s maritime domain and transnational organized
crime. In this context, the Commission intensified its engagement with all stakeholders,
including the RECs and Regional Mechanisms as well as civil society organizations
(CSOs).

                                                                          EX.CL/1061(XXXII)
                                                                                   Page 12

8.     Furthermore, the Commission, the RECs/Regional Mechanisms and the
European Union convened a meeting in Cotonou, Benin, in mid-November 2017 during
which they considered all issues that had impeded the implementation of EU Support
Programme to APSA. The Programme is due to end in 2018, with the risk of creating a
financial vacuum. This risk underlines, once more, the urgent need for the AU and the
RECs/Regional Mechanisms to intensify efforts towards mobilizing reliable, predictable
and sustainable funding for Africa’s peace and security initiatives.

9.     On its part, the Peace and Security Council (PSC) deepened its engagements
with all the relevant stakeholders, including the all Commission’s Departments that
contribute to its work, as well as other AU Organs and the RECs, in fulfilment of its
mandate to promote and maintain peace and security on the continent. Whenever
necessary, the Peace and Security Council requested briefings from these Organs on
issues under their purview to inform its deliberations. The briefings ranged from specific
country situations to the plight of internally displaced persons and refugees, elections,
women and youth, and post-conflict reconstruction and stabilization efforts. The
following cases illustrate some of the work of the Commission undertaken to facilitate
the interaction between the APSA and the AGA.

10.    Mali and the Sahel Region: During the reporting period, the Commission
continued to promote the need for joint efforts between the countries of the region, the
African Union and the international community to encourage all the Malian parties to
implement without further delay all the provisions of the agreement reached within the
framework of the Algiers process. These efforts provided support to the electoral
process and ensured the organization of peaceful elections at the local, regional and
presidential levels. Similarly, all obstacles, including logistical and financial, that hinder
the deployment of the G5 Sahel Force should be resolved, so as to boost the region’s
determination to fight against terrorism, cross-border organized crime, human trafficking
and extremism. In this respect, intensive consultations were undertaken by the
Chairperson of the Commission, with the G5 Sahel and all concerned partners, in
particular with the UN, aiming at the early operationalization of the G5.

11.    Burundi: The Inter-Burundi Dialogue held in December 2017 under the auspices
of the East African Community (EAC) and its mediator, former President Benjamin
Mkapa, is yet to produce the expected results. The Commission remains convinced that
only an inclusive dialogue based on the Arusha Agreement of August 2000 could help
address and find a suitable solution to the prevailing situation and guide the
constitutional reforms that may be required. The African Union will spare no effort to
assist all Burundian stakeholders in this regard, including through the continued
deployment of its human rights observers and military experts. Resources are needed
to sustain their deployment throughout the national territory and their subsistence, with
the cooperation of the Government of Burundi

12.   In the Central African Republic (CAR), the absence of a lasting solution to the
issue of politico-military groups remains a real concern and an obstacle to the
consolidation of the state and its main institutions. The adoption in Libreville in July
-----------------------Page 15 End-----------------------

                                                                        EX.CL/1061(XXXII)
                                                                                 Page 13

2017, of the Roadmap of the African Initiative for Peace and Reconciliation in the CAR,
which was spearheaded by the AU with the support of the Economic Community of
Central African States (ECCAS), the International Conference of the Great Lakes
Region (ICGLR), and the Republics of Gabon, Congo, Angola and Chad, provided a
unified framework for the concerted resolution of the issue of armed groups and the
restoration of state authority countrywide. The initiative also gave the African Union a
key role to play in the search for a lasting settlement of the crisis in the CAR, while
complementing the efforts of the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated
Stabilization Mission in the Central African Republic (MINUSCA). It is therefore
imperative that the African Union and the stakeholders in the African Initiative join hands
to mobilize the requisite resources for its effective implementation, particularly with
regard to the active participation of all armed groups and coordination with the
MINUSCA operations.

13.      Following the working visit of the Chairperson of the Commission to the
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) in September-October 2017, and that of the
Peace and Security Council in October 2017, as well as the publication in November
2017 of the electoral calendar by the Independent National Electoral Commission
(CENI), it is of the utmost urgency that the African Union, concerned sub-regional
organizations and the partners work together to ensure the smooth preparation and the
holding of free, peaceful and credible elections. Furthermore, the African Union and its
partners should work together to impress on all the Congolese political and social actors
to fully commit to peace and tranquillity before, during and after the elections so as to
facilitate the mobilization of international assistance for the country’s economic recovery
and the restoration of state authority nationwide. The resurgence of attacks by negative
forces and the resulting dire humanitarian consequences highlight the need for the
signatories of the Framework Agreement for Peace, Security and Cooperation for the
DRC and the Great Lakes Region to accelerate their efforts towards neutralizing these
forces. The Summit of Heads of State and Government in Brazzaville in October 2017
gave new impetus to the pooling of resources required for the achievement of this
objective.

14.    The political and institutional crisis in Guinea Bissau since 2015 remains a
source of concern for the country, the region and the continent. Mediation efforts by
Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), the African Union and others
did not yield positive results. A genuine and inclusive dialogue based on mutual respect
is imperative in this country to enable all the stakeholders to find a consensual solution
to the crisis and to establish the necessary conditions to consolidate peace and stability.
The Commission will continue to support the ECOWAS mediation efforts and call for the
implementation of the Conakry Agreement and its roadmap, in order to ensure a smooth
preparation of the 2018 legislative elections. Equally, the African Union should spare no
efforts in mobilizing the financial resources needed to support the extension of
ECOWAS Mission in Guinea Bissau (ECOMIB) presence which is critical in providing an
enabling environment for the capacitation of the national security forces.

                                                                       EX.CL/1061(XXXII)
                                                                                Page 14

15.     In Libya, the political situation remained deadlocked, with added insecurity and a
dire humanitarian crisis, despite strong and concerted international efforts to encourage
Libyan stakeholders to engage in political talks to amend and implement the Libya
Political Agreement (LPA). The African Union sustained its efforts for a peaceful
resolution of the crisis through an inclusive political process. Through its High
Representative for Libya, former President Jakaya Kikwete, and its High-Level
Committee on Libya led by President Denis Sassou Nguesso of Congo, the African
Union intensified its engagements to bridge the political divide between the Libyan
parties. The Roadmap of the High-Level Committee envisages the amendment of the
Libyan Political Agreement to be followed by its adoption by a national reconciliation
Conference. The Commission worked throughout the year in collaboration with partners,
in particular, the ‘Quartet for Libya’ comprising the African Union, the United Nations,
the European Union and the League of Arab States.

16.     In 2017, the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) made significant
gains in degrading the capacity of Al-Shabaab terrorist group, as evidenced by the
recovery of about 80% of the Somali national territory from the terrorist group. This
achievement created a conducive environment for the smooth progression of the
political process, notably the elections that took place in February 2017. Despite
numerous challenges on the ground, progress was also achieved in enhancing the
capacity of the state institutions at the federal and regional levels. AMISOM’s role
remains critical in maintaining peace and security in Somalia, pending the full
capacitation of the Somali National Security Forces (SNSF) to take over this critical
responsibility. In accordance with its exit strategy, AMISOM started transferring some
primary responsibilities to the Somali national army and gradually reducing its troops on
the ground. One thousand AMISOM soldiers were thus repatriated to their home
countries between October and December 2017.

17.     However, the transition of security responsibilities from AMISOM to the Somali
Federal Government should be done without haste, in a phased process and according
to mutually agreed benchmarks. The Peace and Security Council, during its 741 st
meeting held on 26 December 2017, noted with concern that the Somali national army,
in its present state, was not yet in a position to take over or sustainably hold forward
operating positions that that may be handed over to it by AMISOM. In this regard, the
PSC reiterated that the transition to Somali-led security and the drawdown of AMISOM
needed to be conditions-based and gradual, to ensure that the hard-won gains so far
made against al-Shabaab are not reversed. The PSC also strongly reaffirmed the need
for AMISOM to be provided with predictable and sustainable funding, with a view to
enabling it to more effectively discharge its mandate, in line of the conclusions of the
Joint AU-UN Review.

18.    With a view to expressing African solidarity to the Somali people under harsh
conditions for decades of ravaging war, the Chairperson of the Commission paid a visit
to Mogadishu soon after his assumption of office in March 2017 and made a token
contribution to the country in its recovery efforts.
-----------------------Page 17 End-----------------------

                                                                        EX.CL/1061(XXXII)
                                                                                 Page 15

19.     With the assistance of the AU High Level Implementation Panel (AUHIP) for
Sudan and South Sudan, led by former President Thabo Mbeki and comprising former
President Abdusalami Abubakar of Nigeria, the Commission continued to support the
search for peaceful settlement of the conflicts in Darfur, Southern Kordofan and Blue
Nile, including by working with the parties on the Roadmap Agreement meant to bring
about a ceasefire between the Sudanese government and armed movements as well as
start an inclusive national dialogue on how to restore democracy and good governance
in the Sudan. The AUHIP was also assisting the Sudan and South Sudan to fully
implement the Cooperation Agreement of 2012. During the period under review, there
was also a reduction of direct clashes between the Sudanese armed forces and the
Darfur armed movements, leading to some downsizing of the African Union-United
Nations Hybrid Operation (UNAMID). Finally, the Commission is pleased to report that
in October 2017, the United States Government decided to lift all economic sanctions
that were imposed on the Sudan twenty years ago.

20.    While welcoming the progress made in the Sudan, the Commission remains
deeply concerned about the lack of resolution of the conflict in South Sudan, and its
tragic impact on the civilian population in terms of deaths and the displacement of
millions in and outside the country. The socio-economic and humanitarian situation
remains dire. Through the AU High Representative for South Sudan, former President
Alpha Konare, and in support of the Inter-Governmental Authority on Development
(IGAD), the Commission sustained its efforts to persuade the parties to fully implement
the Agreement on the Resolution of Conflict in the Republic of South Sudan of August
2015.

21.     In this regard, the Chairperson of the Commission paid a visit to South Sudan in
March 2017 in expression of African solidarity with the South-Sudanese people in dire
situation and to see for himself the devastating effects of the conflict. On this occasion,
he made a token contribution towards alleviating the sufferings of the people.

22.     On 21 December, the first phase of the IGAD-led Forum for the Revitalization of
the South Sudan Peace Process came to a close, marked by the signing of an
Agreement on Cessation of Hostilities, Protection of Civilians and Humanitarian Access.
This achievement remains nonetheless a small and fragile first step. The Commission
will continue to work closely with IGAD and other stakeholders to ensure that the parties
fully implement the Agreement and build on it to bring about a lasting solution to the
conflict in South Sudan.

23.    A series of initiatives towards the peaceful resolution of the dispute in Western
Sahara between the Kingdom of Morocco and the Frente POLISARIO produced no real
progress by the end of this reporting period. The Commission reiterates its hope that,
with the welcomed return of the Kingdom of Morocco to the AU fold, a solution to this
longstanding dispute may now be within reach.

24.   The Commission also sustained its cooperation with Member States, the RECs
and other stakeholders such as civil society organizations on Silencing the Guns in
-----------------------Page 18 End-----------------------

                                                                        EX.CL/1061(XXXII)
                                                                                 Page 16

Africa by 2020. With about three years left, the Commission strongly believes that this
goal can be reached if given goodwill and support by all stakeholders concerned. The
appointment of Ambassador Ramtane Lamamra, former Minister of Foreign Affairs of
the People’s Democratic Republic of Algeria, and former Commissioner for Peace and
Security of the African Union, as High Representative of the Chairperson of the
Commission for Silencing the Guns in Africa, is aimed at accelerating the drive for the
realization of a conflict-free Africa and galvanize Member States and other stakeholders
towards achieving this goal by its deadline. In this vein, the Commission wishes to
remind Member States to commemorate the month of September of each year until
2020 as the “Africa Amnesty Month”. This event was set by a decision of the Assembly
for the surrender and collection of illegally owned weapons in line with African and
international best practices.

25.    The Commission continued to work with the RECs on the operationalization of
the African Standby Force and its Rapid Deployment Capability as directed by the
Assembly of the Union. It is worth noting that the verification process on the status of
the Regional Standby Forces was successfully completed in November 2017. The
outcome was adopted by the AU Specialized Technical Committee on Defence, Safety
and Security at its meeting in Addis Ababa on 9 January 2018. At the same time, the
African Capacity for Immediate Response to Crises (ACIRC) has remained in a state of
readiness for deployment, depending on the Assembly’s decision on the way forward.

26.    The Commission also set up various mechanisms for conflict prevention and
early warning to foresee and act swiftly on looming security threats and crises. But for
their effectiveness, such mechanisms need to be matched by timely responses and
adequate political will, as well as by enabling financial and material resources to prevent
costly escalation in human and financial terms.

27.     The first joint meeting of the Djibouti and Nouakchott Processes of the Heads of
Intelligence and Security Services (HISS) of participating Member States and
Organizations took place in Addis Ababa in November 2017. The participants reviewed
the security situation in the Sahelo-Saharan and the East African regions, and called for
greater synergies, enhanced collaboration and information sharing between the two
processes.

28.   The African Union, in close collaboration with IGAD, convened a strategic
consultative meeting on the Horn of Africa, which was held in Khartoum in October
2017. The participants launched a strategic consultative process that will culminate in
the development of a regional strategy for peace and security in the Horn of Africa.

29.    With respect to cross-border cooperation, the Commission encouraged Member
States to sign, ratify and domesticate the African Union Convention on Cross-border
Cooperation (also known as the Niamey Convention). Experts from Member States
validated the draft African Union Border Governance Strategy at a meeting held in
Addis Ababa in November 2017. The draft will be submitted soon for the consideration
to the Policy Organs.

                                                                                Page 17


30.    The Commission also worked with Member States, the RECs and international
partners to strengthen the AU mediation capacity, pursuant to the Assembly’s decision
[Assembly/AU/Dec.558 (XXIV)]. Efforts are underway to establish a Mediation Support
Unit within the Commission, which will provide substantive and operational support to all
AU-led and/or supported mediation efforts.

Output 2: Participation of women, youth, civil society in peace building, conflict
          prevention and post-conflict recovery and development facilitated

31.    Efforts continued in 2017 to enhance the implementation of African and
international instruments and policies relating to the participation of women, the youth
and civil society in conflict prevention, peace consolidation and post-conflict recovery.

32.     As part of the activities under the Theme of the year 2017, the Commission, in
collaboration with the East African Community (EAC), ECOWAS and Economic
Community of Central African States (ECCAS), organized three regional youth
consultations meetings. The Consultations brought together over 250 young men and
women from the five regions to deliberate on how to promote the meaningful
participation of young people in electoral processes in Africa. The meetings took place
in Tunisia for North Africa, Tanzania for East and Southern Africa, and Nigeria for West
and Central Africa.

33.    In collaboration with the Government of South Africa and the AGA Platform
members based in South Africa – the African Peer Review Mechanism (APRM), the
Pan-African Parliament (PA) and NEPAD, the Commission held its 2017 High-Level
Dialogue in Pretoria in December 2017, under the theme, “Enhancing Youth
Participation and Representation in Governance Processes in Africa”. Participants
deliberated on the barriers hindering meaningful participation and representation in
governance processes and proposed practical solutions to overcome them.

34.     The Department of Political Affairs and the Women, Gender and Development
Directorate teamed up in the organization in Lusaka of the 2017 AGA Gender Pre-
Forum, to exchange views on how to enhance the participation of young women in
political processes in Africa. It also enabled them to reflect on progress made so far and
discuss ways to overcome the challenges to a more meaningful participation in the
future.

35.    Several short videos were produced throughout the year under review on
selected thematic areas pertinent to young people, including young women, and their
contribution to deepening democratic culture and good governance on the continent.
The videos are available on the AGA website http://aga-platform.org/engage.

36.     In conclusion, the year 2017 witnessed significant progress in the Commission’s
efforts to build synergy between the African Governance Architecture and the African
Peace and Security Architecture. At the operational level, there was increased
-----------------------Page 20 End-----------------------

                                                                        EX.CL/1061(XXXII)
                                                                                 Page 18

interaction between relevant Departments of the Commission, the RECs and other AU
Organs and Specialized Agencies. At the policy level, the enhancement of the quality
and outputs from the work program of the Peace and Security Council in 2017 showed
how this Organ benefitted from this growing synergy.

37.    However, the two architectures suffered enormously from a lack of Africa’s own
financial resources. The justification for the establishment of the Peace Fund was to
address the perennial issue of unpredictable resources and inadequate staffing. In this
regard, the Commission expresses its gratitude to Member States that have made their
assessed contributions to the Peace Fund and operational budget of the Commission,
and encourages other Member States to do the same.

38.    Overall, Member States are encouraged to accelerate the implementation of the
Assembly’s Kigali Decision on 0.2%. The Commission is grateful to AU partners for their
continuous support to the AU programs. However, the African Union cannot continue to
defer to its partners on its core responsibility. The late Julius Nyerere, warned that
“Independence cannot be real if a nation depends upon gift”. In 2018, Member States
are expected to finance the AU program budget to the tune of 61%. In 2020, this should
rise to 75% for our Member States and the remaining for AU partners. This was the
decision of the Assembly in Johannesburg, South Africa, in June 2015. It must be
implemented. Consequently, all Member States are urged to meet their financial
obligations as this will greatly help strengthen the AU’s ability to execute its programs
and assist those Member States going through or emerging conflict, as well as those
encountering difficult political transitions.

Output 3: Post-conflict reconstruction and peace-building mechanisms
          enhanced

39.    Overall, the AU’s role on post-conflict reconstruction and peacebuilding has
become increasingly recognized, attracting greater attention from the Policy Organs,
particularly the PSC, as well as Member States and both bilateral and international
partners despite a dearth of resources.

40.   In the year 2017, the Commission’s efforts on post-conflict reconstruction and
development focused, among other areas, on strengthening joint planning, needs
assessment, implementation, coordination and partnerships with the RECs. To this end,
the Commission developed a results-based framework, and a post-conflict
reconstruction and development guidelines to make AU interventions more
comprehensive, integrated and better coordinated. The Commission also supported the
Lake Chad Basin Commission in the development of a strategy for the stabilization of
areas affected by the Boko Haram terrorist group.

41.    The African Union plans to scale up its stabilisation efforts on the continent as it
aims to manage transitions from initial stabilisation which often has a heavy military
footprint to, short to medium-term socio-economic and political development and long-
term peacebuilding with a focus on reconstruction, revitalisation of public service
-----------------------Page 21 End-----------------------

                                                                          EX.CL/1061(XXXII)
                                                                                   Page 19

institutions. In this respect, the Commission, in partnership with the Lake Chad Basin
Commission, convened a regional conference in Ndjamena in November 2017, as a first
step in the process of developing a Regional Stabilisation Strategy for areas affected by
Boko Haram. The Conference will be followed by a second regional conference in the
first quarter of 2018 to finalise a comprehensive regional strategy that will rationalise the
various initiatives aimed at stabilising the areas affected by Boko Haram’s activities in
the Lake Chad Basin region. In the same vein, the stabilisation efforts in Somalia and
Sudan within the framework of the AMISOM and the UNAMID, respectively, will also be
scaled up.

42.     In the Sudan, the Commission was developing a joint fundraising strategy for the
implementation of the Integrated Strategic Framework (2017-2019) that identified
common priorities for sustainable peace in Darfur. The strategy aims to scale up
resources for peace consolidation in the next two years for a phased transition in Darfur,
and will also include an outreach to non-conventional donors, engagement of
international and regional financial institutions, and wider scope of financial resources.
Funding for consolidation of peacebuilding efforts in Darfur should be treated as a
political issue of high priority by Members States to protect to date investment in peace
and to avoid relapse into conflict.

43.     The Commission continued to provide operational and technical support in the
area of security sector reform to States emerging from conflict, in line with the AU Policy
Framework. In this respect, the Commission commends Madagascar for the progress
made to date, including the official launch, in September 2017, of the implementation of
the national policy paper on SSR and the establishment of the national coordination
office that will lead the implementation of the operational plans. In Guinea Bissau, the
Commission has continued to assist the authorities in preparing potential retirees at the
defense and security institutions for disengagement from active service as part of the
overall plans to gradually reduce and restructure the defense forces and security
services. In this respect, skills acquisition training and material support was extended to
retiring and demobilized personnel in late 2017. Where the political and security
conditions are conducive, the Commission will continue to extend such support in close
collaboration with the RECs and international partners within the framework of the
Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration (DDR) program.

44.     In undertaking PCRD implementation, some key mechanisms within the AU
PRCD architecture have played a critical role in ensuring an effective implementation of
the PCRD Policy Framework. It should be noted that some mechanisms are not yet
established. The Commission, therefore, supports the establishment of a functional
multidimensional AU Committee on PCRD, which would ensure that engagement and
coordination on PCRD implementation will be taken to a strategic level, between the
leadership of the AUC and the RECs/RMs and its Organs. This would address the
complexities of PCRD initiatives and strengthen current technical and operational level
efforts.

Output 4: Good governance and democracy promoted

45.    The Commission undertook a number of technical assessment missions to
Angola, Liberia, Kenya and Djibouti ahead of elections in these countries. The objective
was to assess the state of preparedness for the elections, review the broader pre-
election political context, and determine whether a conducive environment existed for
the conduct of transparent, free and fair elections in conformity with the principles of the
African Union governing democratic elections. Pre-election assessment missions also
made recommendations that formed the basis of the decision by the Chairperson of the
Commission to deploy AU election observation missions.

46.    In accordance with existent practice, the Commission observed all national
elections (presidential and parliamentary) in 2017 by deploying either short-term or
long-term election observers. The decision to deploy either short-term or long-term
observers is generally based on a number of criteria, including the type of elections
(presidential or parliamentary), the nature of elections (contentious or highly
competitive), the overall political situation in the country (post-conflict or transition
phase), availability of funds, and specific request from Member States. For 2017, the
Commission deployed short-term observers to all the elections, while long-term
observers were deployed to Lesotho, Kenya and Liberia only.

47.    During the period under review, the Commission also provided technical
assistance to the electoral commissions in the Republic of The Gambia and the
Kingdom of Lesotho in carrying out post-election evaluation exercises. The objective
was to help election management boards in these countries to undertake a
comprehensive review of the conduct of previous elections, identify challenges and
areas for reforms, and develop appropriate strategies for efficient and effective
management of future elections. In the DRC, the Commission deployed a short-term
election expert to provide technical assistance to the Bureau of the Chairperson of the
Independent National Electoral Commission in its planning and preparations for the
elections now rescheduled for 2018.

48.     The Commission also carried out BRIDGE (Building Resources in Democracy,
Governance and Elections) trainings to staff of the electoral management boards in
Somalia and Central African Republic. The aim was to build internal capacities of staff
to deliver credible democratic elections in accordance with international standards.

49.    In November 2017, the Commission convened the Fourth Annual Election
Management Board Forum in Kigali under the theme “Harnessing the Democratic
Dividend through Enhanced Youth Participation in Electoral Processes in Africa”. The
theme was chosen in recognition of the important role the youth can play in deepening
democratic governance and shaping socio-economic development on the continent.
Since election management boards are key in facilitating the participation of young
people in electoral and governance processes, the Commission deemed it necessary to
provide a platform to reflect on barriers, opportunities and strategies for meaningful
youth participation in electoral processes. The Commission has observed in the last few

                                                                                 Page 21

years that, despite the conduct of regular elections on the continent, youth participation
in electoral processes is on the decline. If not addressed, this and other negative trends
affecting youth participation in electoral and political processes could be a threat to the
consolidation and sustainability of democracy, peace and stability on the continent.

50.     The Commission also continued to ensure that women participate equally in all
its election-related activities, including observation, trainings, and technical assistance
programs.

51.    Quarterly briefings were organized for the Peace and Security Council on the
state of elections in Africa, providing updates on progress made in the organization of
peaceful, free and fair elections, and alerting this policy organ to emerging challenges
that could have an impact on democratic governance, peace and stability.

52.    Overall, 2017 was a year of generally peaceful and accepted elections, with the
exception of a few Member States where their credibility was challenged in courts.
While the regularity and overall quality of elections had improved, challenges still
remained. They included (i) difficulty for election management boards to secure enough
funding and safeguard their independence; (ii) challenges faced by national judiciary
mechanisms and other election-adjudicating bodies to establish or assert their
independence in dealing with election-related disputes; (iii) the existence of electoral
measures and practices that sometimes disenfranchise women, youth and the poor;
and (iv) policies that fail to adequately ensure fair and equitable access by contesting
parties and candidates to state resources.

Output 5: Legal and shared-values instruments, based on African and universal
          instruments promoted

53.     Status of ratifications and accessions to OAU/AU Treaties: During 2017, a
total of eighteen (18) new signatures were appended and forty (40) new instruments of
ratification were deposited compared with eighty (80) signatures and forty-one (41)
ratifications during the previous reporting period. The Commission is also in the process
of registering ten (10) OUA/AU Treaties with the United Nations Headquarters in line
with Article 102 of the United Nations Charter.

54.    The Commission was also finalising the AU Treaty Book, which is expected to be
published in 2018, as well as a Treaty Digest that will provide a summary of key
elements of each treaty, including its objectives, Member States obligations, including
reporting obligations if any, financial implications, responsible line ministries and other
relevant information. Efforts on creating a treaty database on the AU website, with a
view to making it interactive and include more and updated information on OAU/AU
Treaties, are also in progress.

55.    In order to promote the ratification of OAU/AU Treaties pursuant to the Executive
Council decision EX.CL/Dec. 837 (XXV), the Commission in collaboration with the
Ministerial Committee on the Challenges of Ratification/Accession and Implementation
-----------------------Page 24 End-----------------------

                                                                      EX.CL/1061(XXXII)
                                                                               Page 22

of OAU/AU Treaties, continued its engagement with Member States on the
establishment of their respective National Sectorial Committees. Once established, the
National Sectorial Committee will liaise with national stakeholders to facilitate the
implementation of national policies, AU decisions related to treaty ratification, and
advocate for the adoption of necessary legislative and administrative measures to give
effect to these treaties.

56.    The Commission commends Member States for the increased number of
signatures and ratifications of OAU/AU Treaties. This enhances the implementation of
AU norms and standards and the harmonisation of national laws, thus facilitating the
integration process. It also supports the AU commitment to strengthen criminal
accountability and respect for the rule of law.

57.     Implementation of AU decisions on the International Criminal Court: In view
of the lack of progress with the International Criminal Court (ICC) in addressing
concerns of the Organization, the Commission developed an Action Plan for the
ratification of the Protocol on the Statutes of the African Court of Justice and Human
and Peoples’ Rights. Once it enters into force, it will create a permanent continental
international criminal justice mechanism to enhance the rule of law as a foundation for
good governance, peace and security. The Action Plan outlines actions to be
undertaken to ensure fifteen (15) instruments of ratification are obtained to guarantee
the entry into force of the Protocol by 2018. The Plan was endorsed by the Open-
ended Ministerial Committee on the ICC in September 2017 and its implementation is
expected to commence in January 2018.

58.     In its previous Annual Report, the Commission had indicated that Burundi, South
Africa and The Gambia had notified the UN Secretary General, as depository of the
Rome Statute of the ICC, of their intention to withdraw from the ICC. Since then, South
Africa and The Gambia have withdrawn their respective notifications while Burundi has
effectively withdrawn and is no longer a State Party to the ICC.

59.   The Commission continued to engage with relevant stakeholders within the
Rome Statute regime, to ensure the decisions of the AU Policy Organs are conveyed
and implemented. A comprehensive report is being submitted to the Assembly through
the Executive Council for consideration.

60.     The Hissène Habré Trial: Pursuant to its decisions Assembly/AU/Dec.103 (VI)
of January 2006 and Assembly/AU/Dec.127 (VII) of July 2007, the Assembly mandated
the Republic of Senegal to prosecute and ensure that Hissène Habré is tried, on behalf
of Africa, by a competent Senegalese court with guarantees for fair trial. The Assembly
also requested the Chairperson of the Union, in consultation with the Chairperson of the
Commission, to provide Senegal with the necessary assistance for the effective conduct
of the trial.

61.    The Extraordinary African Chambers (EAC) on 30 May 2016, ruling in the first
instance (Assises Chamber), found Hissène Habré guilty of crimes against humanity,
-----------------------Page 25 End-----------------------

                                                                      EX.CL/1061(XXXII)
                                                                               Page 23

rape, forced slavery, intentional homicide, massive and systematic practice of summary
executions, abduction of people followed by enforced disappearance, torture and
inhumane acts. He was also found guilty of the following war crimes: murder, torture,
inhumane treatment and unlawful detention. On the basis of the crimes for which
Hissène Habré was convicted, he was sentenced to life imprisonment.

62.     On appeal, the Appeals Chamber confirmed the ruling rendered by the Assises
Chamber, particularly concerning the sentencing of the accused to life imprisonment,
but acquitted him of the charge for the crime of rape. The Appeals Chamber ruling on
the issue of reparations partially overturned the judgement of the Assises Chamber and
carried out the necessary corrections by recognising seven thousand, three hundred
and ninety-six (7,396) victims as civil plaintiffs, to whom the amount of CFA eighty-two
billion two hundred and ninety million francs (CFA 82,290,000,000) was determined as
compensation. While ruling that Hissène Habré is to pay this amount, the Chamber
acknowledged that the accused’s assets could not cover all the compensation to
victims.

63.    The Appeals Chamber, inter alia, (i) directed that the Trust Fund established by
the African Union should implement the individual reparations, (ii) ordered that the
proceeds of confiscated property and any other of the Defendant’s assets that might be
discovered should be deposited into the Fund, (iii) invited the Fund to contact the
Government of Chad, interested States and organizations, and civil party associations
on the possible realisation and implementation of collective and moral reparations.

64.    In implementing Decision EX.CL/Dec.972 (XXXI) of July 2017, the Commission
submitted the draft Statutes of the Trust Fund for victims of Hissène Habré crimes to the
Specialized Technical Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs for consideration. These
will now be submitted to the current Session of the Assembly for adoption. In addition,
the Commission is in consultation with the Government of the Republic of Chad on the
establishment of the Secretariat of the Trust Fund, bearing in mind the ruling of the
Extraordinary African Chambers that the Senegalese Courts will have jurisdiction over
all matters arising from the implementation of that decision.

65.    Establishment of the Hybrid Court for South Sudan: In accordance with the
Communiqué of the 547th meeting of the Peace and Security Council and the
Agreement on the Resolution of the Conflict in South Sudan (ARCISS), the
Commission, in collaboration with the Transitional Government of National Unity of the
Republic of South Sudan, concluded negotiations on a Memorandum of Understanding
(MoU), which includes a Statute establishing the Hybrid Court for South Sudan. The
MoU and the Statute annexed to it are awaiting approval by the National Council of
Ministers and domestication by the Transitional Legislative Assembly of South Sudan.

66.    Meanwhile, the Commission launched the Hybrid Court’s preliminary activities
that included, among other things, the identification of the seat of the Hybrid Court, as
well as the development of its structure, budget and a resource mobilization strategy
and preparation for a donor conference.

                                                                                 Page 24


67.    Draft Annexes to the African Charter on Maritime Security and Safety and
Development in Africa: By its decision Ext/Assembly/AU/Dec.1 (VI), the Assembly
adopted the Charter on Maritime Security, Safety and Development during its
Extraordinary Session of 15 October 2016 in Lomé, Togo, and requested that the
Commission takes all necessary measures to convene the relevant Specialized
Technical Committees (STCs) in order to develop annexes to the Charter on the
specialised areas of maritime to accommodate the developmental aspects, which were
not duly covered under the Charter.

68.    The Commission thus developed eight (8) draft Annexes in the following areas:
(i) Definitions; (ii) General Provisions; (iii) Living marine resources; (iv) Extraction of
non-living resources; (v) Climate and Environmental Sustainability; (vi) Poverty
Eradication, Employment and Social Development; (vii) Blue Economy; and (viii)
Cabotage. The draft annexes will be submitted to the relevant STCs prior to
consideration by the Policy Organs through the STC on Justice and Legal Affairs in
2018.

69.    Implementation of the UN General Assembly Resolution on the Chagos
Archipelago: Pursuant to the International Court of Justice Order no.169 dated July
2017, and in accordance with various decisions of the Assembly on the Chagos
Archipelago in support of the full decolonization of the Republic of Mauritius, the
Commission sent a request to Member States that are willing to furnish relevant
information on the question before the International Court of Justice to submit their
written statements by 30 January 2018.

AFRICAN COMMISSION FOR HUMAN AND PEOPLE’S RIGHTS (ACHPR)

70.    As of this reporting, the ACHPR had completed over 58.6% of the activities
planned for 2017. Other activities were also undertaken that were not originally in its
2017 workplan, such as those related to Special Mechanisms and meetings organized
by partners and various Departments/Directorates of the Commission which fell within
its mandate.

71.    Notable achievements included the following:

           The celebration of the 30-year anniversary of the operationalization of the
            ACHPR and its contribution to human rights promotion and protection on
            the continent;

           The adoption of nine (9) additional important soft law instruments, among
            them: (i) General Comment No. 4 on the African Charter on Human and
            Peoples’ Rights: The Right to Redress for Victims of Torture and other
            Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Punishment or Treatment (Article 5) (General
            Comment No. 4); (ii) Guidelines for the Policing of Assemblies by Law
            Enforcement Officers in Africa; (iii) Guidelines on Freedom of Association
-----------------------Page 27 End-----------------------

                                                                      EX.CL/1061(XXXII)
                                                                               Page 25

           and Freedom of Peaceful Assembly in Africa; (iv) Study on Extractive
           Industries, Land Rights and Indigenous Populations/Communities Rights;
           (v) Guidelines on Combatting Sexual Violence and its Consequences in
           Africa; (vi) Joint General Comments on Child Marriage between the ACHPR
           and the African Committee of Experts on the Rights and Welfare of the
           Child; (vii) the Guidelines on Access to Information and Elections for Africa;
           (viii) Principles on the Decriminalisation of Petty Offences; and (ix) the
           convening of the first Regional Seminar on Implementation of the
           Commission’s Decisions and Concluding Observations on States Reports;

          Consideration, for the first and second time, of four (4) APRM Reports on
           States in accordance with APRM Base Document which allows to publicly
           table concluded reports of participating Member States to key regional
           bodies like the ACHPR;

          Consideration of twenty-eight (28) Communications (i.e. complaints of
           human rights violations) and granting of Provisional Measures for 10 of the
           Communications;

          Consideration of four (4) States Reports in accordance with Article 62 of the
           African Charter;

          Numerous letters of urgent appeal were sent and Press Releases issued;

          Granting of Affiliate Status to one (1) National Human Rights Institution and
           Observer Status to eleven (11) Non-Governmental Organizations;

          Adoption of twelve (12) Country and Thematic Resolutions by May 2017;

          Publication in KiSwahili of the Guidelines on Conditions of Arrest, Police
           Custody and Pre-Trial Detention in Africa (Luanda Guidelines) in April 2017.

          Furthermore, the ACHPR continued to increase awareness of human rights
           through mobilization for more participation at its public Session; in 2017, a
           total number of one thousand one hundred and fifty-eight (1,158) delegates
           of which 221 delegates were from 25 Member States of the Union,
           participated in the public Sessions of the ACHPR.

72.    The Country and Thematic Resolutions, letters of urgent appeal, Press Releases
issued by the ACHPR served as interventions in emerging human rights situations
across the continent. The Concluding Observations on State Reports assisted different
levels in the concerned Governments to review their Charter implementation strategies
and ensure that enabling legislative measures are taken.

                                                                          EX.CL/1061(XXXII)
                                                                                   Page 26

73.   The various decisions and recommendations on Communications brought before
the Commission resulted in the increase of human rights protection in the concerned
Member States of the Union when there is implementation.

74.    The major challenges that affected the work of the ACHPR during this reporting
period included the following: (i) difficulties in getting the required prior authorization by
Member States for undertaking promotion and protection missions; (ii) low level of
implementation of the decisions and recommendations of the ACHPR; (iii) acute staff
shortage due to delay in recruitment to vacant positions within its approved structure, as
well as the inadequacy of the current structure of the ACHPR to effectively meet the
mandate entrusted to it and the expansion in its work over the years.

75.    The ACHPR’s impact as an effective human rights organ of the African Union
depends primarily on the support and cooperation it receives from Member States. This
includes authorisation for its missions and concrete steps by Member States to
implement ACHPR decisions and recommendations.

76.    Priority activities for 2018 are outlined in the Strategic Plan 2015-2019. They are
essentially focused on the promotion and protection of human rights in line with the
African Charter. In broad strokes, they continue and expand on similar priorities
reported hereunder.

AFRICAN COURT ON HUMAN AND PEOPLE’S RIGHTS (AfCHPR)

77.    The African Court on Human and People’s Rights (AfCHPR) became operational
in 2006 and is composed of eleven Judges appointed by the Assembly. As at 31
December, 2017, the Protocol establishing the Court has been ratified by thirty (30)
Member States of the African Union, namely: Algeria, Benin, Burkina Faso, Burundi,
Cameroon, Chad, Congo, Côte d’Ivoire, Comoros, Gabon, The Gambia, Ghana, Kenya,
Libya, Lesotho, Malawi, Mali, Mauritania, Mauritius, Mozambique, Niger, Nigeria,
Uganda, Rwanda, Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic, Senegal, South Africa, Tanzania,
Togo and Tunisia. However, of the 30 State Parties to the Protocol, only eight have
made the Declaration under Article 34(6) of the Protocol accepting the jurisdiction of the
Court to receive cases from individuals and non-governmental organizations. They are
Benin, Burkina Faso, Côte d’Ivoire, Ghana, Malawi, Mali, Tanzania and Tunisia.

78.     During the period under review, the Court was seized with thirty-six (36) new
cases. The number of applications registered by the Court since its establishment now
stands at one-hundred and fifty-six (156), while the number of requests for advisory
opinion stands at twelve (12). The number of cases discharged by the Court as of
December 2017 stands at forty-one (41), including four (4) cases transferred to the
African Commission in accordance with Article 6(3) of the Protocol, while one-hundred
and fifteen (115) cases are still pending before the Court.

79.    The Court also delivered nine (9) judgments on the merits, issued four (4) Orders
and five (5) Advisory Opinions. It also examined and deferred one-hundred and fifteen
-----------------------Page 29 End-----------------------

                                                                         EX.CL/1061(XXXII)
                                                                                  Page 27

(115) applications for further consideration. The Court has also installed an e-case
management system to ensure speedy and transparent consideration of cases. The
Court is closely reviewing ways to accelerate finalization of cases without undermining
quality of its decisions on judicial work.

80.     The Court organized the Third African Judicial Dialogue in Arusha in November
2017, on the theme 'Improving Judicial Efficiency in Africa’, which was attended by
over 150 participants, including representatives of the judiciaries of 30 Member States
of the African Union, current and former judges of the African Court, judges of regional
judicial institutions, academics, media personalities, human rights practitioners and civil
society organizations. The Dialogue adopted concrete measures on, among other
things, the promotion of judicial education in Africa, the establishment of an African
judicial network and the use of ICT in effective justice delivery.

81.    The Court also undertook sensitization visits to Member States during which its
delegation held fruitful discussions with high-ranking government officials, including the
President of the Republic of Tunisia, the President of the Republic of Guinea Bissau,
the Prime Minister of the Republic of Cape Verde and the Foreign Ministers of all the
countries visited. The authorities of Egypt, Guinea Bissau and Cape Verde undertook to
take necessary measures to ratify the Protocol, while the President of the Republic of
Tunisia signed the Article 34(6) Declaration. During the visits, the Court, in collaboration
with the respective host governments, organized half-day sensitization seminars for
human rights stakeholders in those countries.

82.    As previously indicated, the lack of universal ratification of the Protocol and the
very low number of Declarations are the major challenges that affected the operation of
the Court in 2017. Essentially, this means that, out of a total of 55 Member States, the
Court can receive cases from individuals only against 8 countries. This severely
undermines the mandate of the Court in ensuring the protection of human rights on the
continent and compromises the rationale for its establishment in the first place.

83.     Another challenge relates to the implementation of the judgements of the Court:
while some Member States complied, others failed or refused. If the Court is to be the
judicial arm of the Union and contribute to the realization of its objectives, all Member
States of the Union must cooperate in the effective implementation of the judgments
and orders of the Court as required by Article 30 of the Protocol.

84.     The priorities of the Court for 2018 are to: (i) streamline Court processes to drive
efficiency and improve understanding among parties on the proceedings of the Court;
(ii) provide access and adequate relief/remedies to victims of human rights violations;
(iii) enhance the coordination and the relationship between the Court, Commission and
ACERWC in the protection of human rights; (iv) encourage additional ratifications of the
Protocol and deposits of the Declaration; and (v) diversify and increase the volume of
funding for the Court.

                                                                                 Page 28

AFRICAN COMMITTEE OF EXPERTS ON THE RIGHTS AND WELFARE OF THE
CHILD (ACERWC)

85.    During the reporting period, the African Committee of Experts on the Rights and
Welfare of the Child (ACERWC) focused its work on (i) improving the ratification of,
reporting on and domestication of the African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the
Child at national level, and (ii) accelerating progress towards the promotion, protection
and respect of the rights and welfare of African children.

86.    A three-day advocacy forum seminar on the implementation of the African
Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child was held in Mauritius in September
2017, to share various experiences on the ratification of, reporting on, and
implementation of the Africa Children’s Charter and create a platform to share
challenges and good practices. The ACERWC also undertook an advocacy mission to
Sao Tome and Principe where it held fruitful discussions with the Government
authorities and various partners working on child issues and chartered the way forward
on the ratification of the ACRWC.

87.      During the reporting period, there was an increase in the reporting by Member
States. 38 out of the 48 Member States that have ratified the Charter submitted their
initial reports, and eight (8) submitted their first and second periodic reports. In 2017,
the ACRWC considered six State Party Reports and seven Complementary Reports.
Concluding observations and recommendations were submitted to the Member States
concerned.

88.    The ACERWC appointed a new AU Special Rapporteur on ending child marriage
in January 2017. The mandate of the Special Rapporteur includes responding to
information on allegations of human rights violations resulting from child marriage
practices in particular countries.

89.    The ACERWC also undertook an investigative mission on issues pertaining to
the rights of children in situations of slavery in a Member State. The mission was
undertaken as part of the communication procedure that was instigated on behalf of
children kept in slavery.

90.     In 2017, the ACERWC launched the findings of its study on the impact of
conflicts and crises on children in Africa. The study originates from a decision made by
the Executive Council which requested the Peace and Security Council to take into
account the rights of the child in its agenda and cooperate actively with the African
Committee of Experts on the Rights and Welfare of the Child (Decision EX.CL/Dec.712
(XXI)). The ACERWC also carried out a comprehensive continental study on the impact
of conflicts and crises on children over the last ten years as well as the measures by
State and non-State actors to protect the rights of children during and in the aftermath of
such conflicts. The study addressed the psychological impact, education, health,
nutrition/food security, separation from parents/caregivers, and sexual and gender-
based violence. Child rights underlie its analysis, particularly the best interest of the
-----------------------Page 31 End-----------------------

                                                                         EX.CL/1061(XXXII)
                                                                                  Page 29

child; the rights to life, survival and development; and respect for the views of the child
as evidenced through children’s voices.

91.    The ACERWC mobilized Member States for the commemoration of the Day of
the African Child (DAC) 2017 whose theme was "The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable
Development for Children in Africa: Accelerating Protection, Empowerment and Equal
Opportunity”. A concept note was shared with Member States to guide them and other
stakeholders on how to commemorate the Day.

92.    To accelerate progress towards Children’s Rights in Africa, the ACERWC
strengthened its collaboration with other African Union Organs, particularly the African
Commission on Human and People’s Rights, as well as with UN Agencies. On 03
November 2017, the ACERWC organized a side event on the margins of the 61st
Ordinary Session of the African Commission on Human and People’s Rights in Banjul,
in order to popularize Agenda 2040. The event brought together the ACHPR, civil
society organizations, National Human Rights Institutions and various other participants.
The objective of the meeting was to create awareness on the contents of Agenda 2040
to pave the way for increased commitment by state and non-state actors for its
implementation.

93.    The ACERWC and the ACHPR also worked together to develop a Joint General
Comment on child marriage. The document was duly considered and adopted by the
two Organs. The aim of the Joint General Comment is to elaborate on the nature of
State Party obligations that arise from Article 6(b) of the Maputo Protocol and Article
21(2) of the African Children's Charter, both of which prohibit child marriage, The
document describes legislative, institutional and other measures that should be taken by
States Parties to give effect to the prohibition of child marriage and protect the rights of
children affected.

94.   A joint consultative meeting between the AU Commission and the Office of the
United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) was held in Banjul in
October 2017 to outline a framework of cooperation between OHCHR and the AU on
human rights in conflict situations.

95.    The major challenges impacting the operations of the ACERWC include failure to
undertake planned activities due to lack of adequate funding. Activities affected include:
the development of an implementation handbook for the African Charter on the Rights
and Welfare of the Child and the implementation of the ACERWC communication plan;
and amendment of Article 5 of protocol to allow the ACERWC to access the African
Court of Human and Peoples’ Rights. Insufficient political will and cooperation of
Member States are also a challenge. For example, only one country ratified the Charter
during the period under review, despite the ACERWC’s universal ratification campaign.
Despite these challenges, the ACERWC will continue to ensure an effective
implementation of the Charter by undertaking the following activities by: (a) continue
lobbying for the universal ratification of, and reporting on the Charter; (b) strengthen
collaboration with other AU Organs and UN partners (to undertake joint activities); (c)

monitor the implementation of Concluding Observations and Recommendations
adopted by State Parties; (d) undertake advocacy visits to States Parties and others
organs on communications (complaints) and investigations; (e) commemorate the 2018
Day of the African Child; (f) develop a General Comment on a provision of the Charter;

capacity of the Secretariat.

AFRICAN UNION BOARD ON CORRUPTION (AUACB)
96.    Member States adopted the AU Convention on Preventing and Combating
Corruption (or The Convention) at the Second Ordinary Session of the Assembly of the
Union, held in Maputo in July 2003. The Convention entered into force on 5 August
2006, thirty (30) days after the deposit of the fifteenth (15th) instrument of ratification. To
date, thirty-eight (38) countries have ratified the Convention and are State Parties to it.

97.     The African Union Advisory Board on Corruption (AUABC) was created on 26
May 2009 under Article 22 (1) of The Convention. It is the unique continental institution
mandated by the African Union to deal with corruption and related themes in Africa. Its
main mandate is to promote and encourage the adoption of measures and actions by
State Parties to prevent, detect, punish and eradicate corruption and related offences in
Africa, as well as to follow-up on the application of those measures and regularly submit
a report to the Executive Council on the progress made by each State Party in
complying with the provisions of the Convention.

98.    The AU Advisory Board on Corruption has eleven part-time Board Members who
elect one among their number as Chairperson. The Bureau is composed of three Board
members namely the Chairperson, Vice Chairperson and the Rapporteur.

99.    One of the major activities of the Board in 2017 was the preparation of Project
2018, which has been declared as the Theme of the year - 2018, namely the African
Anti-Corruption Year. Based on submissions by the Board, the Executive Council
endorsed the proposal, including the nomination for the Champion for the Year, H.E.
Muhammadu Buhari, President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. The Executive
Council requested that the Board not only holds further consultations with Member
States on its proposals for the Strategic Plan for 2017-2021, and on the Concept Note
for Project 2018, but also submits an update on its proposals.

100. Subsequently, the Board hosted a Continental Consultative Workshop to enrich
the Concept Note and the draft Strategic Plan. The workshop also brainstormed on an
African Corruption Measurement. Thirty-two (32) Member States took part in the
workshop, alongside civil society organizations and development partners.

101. During the year 2017, the Board held three ordinary sessions at which a new
Bureau was elected in July 2017 (Inaugural session). Board members, having been
elected by the Executive Council in January and July 2017 respectively, were
subsequently sworn in, in the inaugural session of the Board held in July 2017. The
-----------------------Page 33 End-----------------------

                                                                          EX.CL/1061(XXXII)
                                                                                   Page 31

Board also established Working Groups on Project 2018, Resource Mobilization and
Mechanism Review.

102. Challenges faced by the Board include inadequate funding for its programs;
difficulty in securing the full collaboration by Member States; and the lean structure of its
Secretariat. However, despite these constraints, the Board is committed to executing its
mandate. In 2018, the main focus will be to raise awareness, increase ownership of the
various anti-corruption initiatives and celebrate the year as the African Anti-Corruption
Year. These activities will enhance the efforts of Member States in combating
corruption, as already adopted by them under the theme “Winning the Fight Against
Corruption: A Sustainable Path to Africa’s Transformation”.

AFRICAN PEER REVIEW MECHANISM (APRM)

103. The mandate of the African Peer Review Mechanism (APRM) is to promote good
governance in Africa by encouraging Member States to adopt policies and practices that
can lead to political stability, strong and inclusive economic growth, sustainable
development and accelerated sub-regional and continental integration. APRM facilitates
good governance by promoting adherence to norms of conduct contained in the African
Charter on Democracy, Elections and Governance (ACDEG).

104. As observed in the recently completed AU Impact Study commissioned by
UNECA, “The APRM has the potential to transform African governance and
development in a number of areas. One is freeing them from undue external influence
on their governance. A second area is liberating them from excessive elite domination
and bringing the population into active participation in the political process. The third
area is grounding policy-making on empirical realities of African countries.”

105. As of November 2017, thirty-six (36) Member States participated in the
Mechanism. Four countries were peer reviewed in a row in January 2017, with the first
second-generation review of Kenya. As a result, by the end of 2017, twenty (20) out of
the 36 members had been reviewed. The Gambia and the Comoros are set to accede in
January 2018, with Uganda to become the second country to be peer-reviewed for the
second time at the same meeting, along with first reviews of Sudan and Liberia.

106. At the 23rd Assembly of Heads of State and Government held in Malabo in June
2014, the Assembly adopted a decision to integrate the APRM as an autonomous entity
within the AU System. This decision catalysed the ability of the APRM to take its place
as a specialized agency of the African Union. As a result, the Mechanism is now firmly
grounded on a legal instrument in the form of the Statute of the African Peer Review
Mechanism, which was provisionally adopted by the African Peer Review Forum on 26
August 2016.

107. Subsequently, at its 28th Ordinary Session in January 2017, the Assembly
decided to extend the mandate of the Mechanism to include tracking the implementation
and undertaking the monitoring and evaluation of the continent’s key governance areas,
-----------------------Page 34 End-----------------------

                                                                          EX.CL/1061(XXXII)
                                                                                   Page 32

specifically Agenda 2063 and the 2030 SDGs. This decision further solidified the
Mechanism’s position to drive the governance agenda in Africa, and restored
confidence in the value, credibility and the prominence of the APRM as a continental
governance tracking mechanism. This role entails the following measures:

           incorporating various governance reports from the African Governance
            Architecture platform and other AU Organs in the annual AU Governance
            Report highlighting the four thematic areas covered by APRM;

           providing country-specific governance briefings currently being developed
            to be domiciled at the APRM; and

           providing access to credible and legitimate knowledge products on the four
            thematic areas covered by APRM. A knowledge hub is currently being
            established and will include a broad variety of electronic policy papers,
            research and other AU institutional documents.

108. Despite recent progress achieved in dealing with governance and socio-
economic development since the APRM’s establishment in March 2003, the African
continent faces some challenges that are of a persistent and recurring nature,
potentially posing threats to sustained socio-economic development and attainment of
the goals of Agenda 2063. Underlined by several APRM reviews, these cross-cutting
issues include (i) violence induced by contested election processes; (ii) management of
diversity, (iii) gender inequality and gender-based violence; (iv) state of the public
service, and the scourge of corruption that impedes public service delivery; (v) issues of
access to land ownership; and (vi) youth unemployment. If not addressed, these
challenges can be a trigger for political instability and violent conflicts on the Continent.

109. The APRM therefore assists Member States to share their experience and learn
from each other on how to deal with these challenges. Working with its strategic
partners, including the African Development Bank, UN-ECA, UNDP, African Capacity
Building Foundation and the Mo Ibrahim Foundation, the APRM also assists Member
States in implementing programs designed to deal with these and other persistent
governance challenges in a holistic manner.

110. In addition to its high-level target to complete four to five governance reviews and
operationalize its governing and research structures, the APRM will accelerate its drive
towards accession to the Mechanism by all AU Member States. Additionally, the APRM
will continue to strengthen its cooperation the AGA and APSA Secretariats in the
following areas:

           addressing the root causes of conflicts by using APRM Country Review
            reports as reference tools, and assisting countries that had undergone the
            APRM reviews to implement their National Programmes Plan of Action
            (NPOAs) in order to address the root causes of looming crises;
-----------------------Page 35 End-----------------------

                                                                       EX.CL/1061(XXXII)
                                                                                Page 33

           early warning and early action by using the mandate of the APRM to
            address early signs of impending political or economic crisis;

           research on election best practices to examine elections and violence in
            Africa with a focus on elections as a source of instability and conflict in
            Africa. The project is a joint activity managed by the AGA-APSA-APRM
            Joint Secretariat. It will feed Agenda 2063 and, in particular the drive
            towards Silencing the Guns by 2020.

PAN-AFRICAN PARLIAMENT (PAP)

111. During the period under review, the Pan-African Parliament (PAP) embarked on
an advocacy programme to sensitize Member States on the need to ratify all legal
instruments of the African Union, including the revised Pan-African Parliament Protocol.
As a result, many Member States had signed the revised Protocol and were now in the
process of ratification. They include Algeria, Benin, Cameroon, Chad, Congo, Ghana,
Guinea Bissau, Madagascar, Mali, Mauritania, Saharawi Arab Democratic Republic
(SADR), Sierra Leone, Sao Tome and Principe, Cameroon and Togo. This brings the
total number of signatures to fifteen (15). However, only five (5) countries ratified and
deposited the instruments with the African Union Commission. They are Gambia, Mali,
SADR, Sierra Leone, and Sao Tome and Principe. At the current rate of ratification, the
revised Protocol will require at least 18 years to achieve the required number of
ratifications, which is twenty-eight (28), even though Speakers and Presiding Officers of
national parliaments have committed to ensuring the ratification of the revised Protocol
by August 2018. The Speakers and Presiding Officers have also committed to
facilitating the ratification of legal instruments signed by their respective governments.

112. With respect to the budget, the Pan-African Parliament noted that the budget of
the PAP – an organ of the African Union – is less than that of Departments of the
African Union Commission. And the largest portion of the budget was reserved for
salaries and not programmes. The Pan-African Parliament would like to organize
programmes that accelerate continental integration. Limited resources are a real
constraint.

113. From 22 to 25 August 2017, the Pan-African Parliament – under the patronage of
the President of the Republic of Cameroon, H.E. Paul Biya – organized a High-Level
Consultative Meeting in Yaoundé in partnership with IDEA, the African Capacity
Building Foundation (ACBF) and the European Commission. The High-Level Meeting
noted that the key to deepening integration is the full ratification of all relevant
continental and legal instruments; the establishment of the Pan-African Parliament as a
legislative body of the AU; and ratification of AU instruments pertaining to Human
Rights. Other major recommendations included in the final communiqué addressed the
need for Member States to pool their individual sovereignties on agreed priorities to
achieve a stronger common good - an integrated Africa with a common socio-economic
development agenda and infrastructure capabilities to harness its vast resources and
-----------------------Page 36 End-----------------------

                                                                        EX.CL/1061(XXXII)
                                                                                 Page 34

overcome the current paradox of resource richness in an environment of high levels of
poverty.

114. With respect to the issue of the “The Future of Africa-EU political partnership in
the perspective of the Post-Cotonou Negotiation”, the conference declared that there is
need to recognize the unity of Africa and fully-capacitated Pan-African institutions as the
key partners and actors of the future political and cooperation agreements. In this
perspective, there is further a need to negotiate a comprehensive Partnership
Agreement encompassing the whole of Africa and to elaborate a unique binding
cooperation framework for the political dialogue that is also based on a unique financial
instrument covering all local and continental initiatives for Africa.

115. At the recently concluded AU-EU Summit in Abidjan, the Pan-African Parliament
noted the limited success of the Joint Africa-Europe roadmap due to limited resources.
It recommended that resources be committed to continental programmes in line with
Agenda 2063. The Pan-African Parliament also called for a revised Cotonou Agreement
which allows for effective partnership rather than dependency. The Joint Parliamentary
Meeting further called on the AU-EU summit to reach an ambitious agreement which
opens the door to a better future for young people in the 21st century. That agreement
must deliver on the pledges made in the SDGs and the Paris Agreement, leading to real
improvements in peoples’ lives and the sustainable use of resources. It must also pave
the way for the electrification of the African continent, which is the basis for any future
development.

116. The Joint Parliamentary Meeting noted that overcoming the root causes of
migration required massive joint investments to create more employment opportunities
for youth. The two Parliaments called upon EU and AU Member States to ensure that
any migratory movement is safe, legal and voluntary. Countries that receive migrants
should make an effort to integrate them, based on a fair burden sharing.

117. The Pan-African Parliament continued to face many challenges during the period
under review, the first being the slow ratification of the revised PAP Protocol – only five
Member States have so far done it. This situation reduces the effectiveness of the
oversight role of the Parliament as its recommendations remain non-binding and without
force. Secondly, the Protocol establishing the PAP requires the officials of the
Commission to submit reports and attend its sessions. However, the Parliament
remains powerless because the Commission’s officials did not respond to its invitations.
A budget must therefore be allocated to enable regular interactions between the
Commission’s officials and the Parliament’s Committees.

118. Members of the Pan-African Parliament remain outside the categories of persons
working in the African Union and are therefore not covered by the financial rules and
regulations. This creates problems when they are undertaking official duties.

119. The Pan-African Parliament continued to experience high turnover of its
members, currently losing at least 25% of MPs after national elections. There is need
-----------------------Page 37 End-----------------------

                                                                       EX.CL/1061(XXXII)
                                                                                Page 35

for a pool of African MPs with an understanding of Pan-African issues to ensure the
integration of the continent. Additionally, Member States struggled to send full
delegations to the Pan-African Parliament sessions and Committee meetings. As a
result, it was often difficult to have a quorum. This delayed the adoption of resolutions
and recommendations.

120. The Pan-African Parliament is mandated by the Assembly to ensure ratification
and domestication of all AU legal instruments, but it lacks financial resources to perform
this responsibility. As a result, the PAP depends on partner funds to undertake statutory
work, and such activities as ratification of AU instruments, engagement with Member
States, Speakers’ Conferences and regional Parliamentary engagement.

Output 6: Capacity for Africa to coordinate and respond to humanitarian
          situations and protect civilians in conflicts and disaster zones
          enhanced

121. The Permanent Representative Committee (PRC) Sub-Committee on Refugees,
Returnees and Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) in Africa is the organ which is
mandated on all matters pertaining to refugees, returnees and internally displaced
persons and other humanitarian issues. It undertook field assessment/solidarity
missions to the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Guinea, Nigeria, Sierra
Leone and South Sudan. The purpose of the Sub-Committee’s field assessment
missions was to observe first-hand the scope and extent of the humanitarian situation in
the countries visited in order to enhance the quality of its reports and recommendations
to the highest Policy Organs of the African Union. The Commission, through the
Department of Political Affairs, supports Member States in building national resilience in
humanitarian response.

                          OUTCOME 2:
   AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION, AGRO-PROCESSING, ENVIRONMENT AND
                 NATURAL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT

Expand agricultural production, developing the agro-processing sectors, increase
market access and attain Africa’s collective food and nutrition self-sufficiency through
promotion of small-holder agriculture, sound environment, natural resource and climate
change management.

OUTPUTS:

      •     Member States implementation of the Comprehensive African Agriculture
            Development Program (CAADP) priority programs, including animal
            resources as an instrument to boost agricultural production and productivity
            for food and nutrition, eliminating hunger and reducing poverty supported;

      •     Implementation of priority programs on environment, natural resources
            management and climate change facilitated.

Output 1: Member States implementation of CAADP priority programs including
          animal resources as an instrument to boost agricultural production
          and productivity for food and nutrition, eliminating hunger and
          reducing poverty supported

CAADP IMPLEMENTATION

122. In 2017, the implementation of the Comprehensive African Agriculture
Development Programme (CAADP) gathered momentum through the following seven
(7) Malabo Commitments: (i) re-committing to the principles and values of the CAADP
process; (ii) enhancing investment finance in agriculture; (iii) ending hunger in Africa by
2025; (iv) cutting poverty in half by 2025 through inclusive agricultural growth and
transformation; (v) boosting intra-African trade in agricultural commodities and services;
(vi) enhancing resilience of livelihoods and production systems to climate variability and
other related risks; and (vii) strengthening mutual accountability to actions and results.

123. The Commission, in collaboration with the NEPAD Planning and Coordination
Agency, the RECs and technical partners, facilitated the development of individual
country reports and the first Continental Biennial Review Report that was endorsed by
the STC on Agriculture, Rural Development, Water and Environment, and will be
presented to the Assembly in January 2018. The report is one of the steps in the
preparation of the CAADP Results Framework, develop technical materials to guide
Member States in data collection and analysis, and equip them with the requisite skills
and competencies for tracking and reporting.
-----------------------Page 39 End-----------------------

                                                                         EX.CL/1061(XXXII)
                                                                                  Page 37

124. Thirty-four (34) experts received certification to provide technical support to the
biennial review processes. Twenty (20) Member States were already on track to
achieve the goals and targets of the Malabo Declaration by 2025. Only ten Member
States out of the 47 that submitted their report have allocated at least 10% of public
expenditure to agriculture. Of the thirty-four (34) Member States that reported on growth
rates of yields of national commodities, thirteen (13) reached the minimum increase of
10 percent required to be on-track for 2017. Out of the twenty-two (22) Member States
that reported progress on reducing the proportion of the population that is
undernourished, only nine (9) countries are on track.

125. On the recommitment to achieving 6% annual growth of the agricultural GDP,
eighteen (18) Member States reported an increase in agricultural GDP of at least 6% in
2016. Out of the twenty-nine (29) Member States that have reported, only three (3)
reached the minimum of 20% in growth rate increase, which is a milestone to be on-
track for the commitment in intra-regional trade of agricultural commodities and services
within Africa. Thirty (30) Member States are on-track for reaching more than the
minimum of 10 for the Trade Facilitation Index (TFI) for creating an enabling
environment for intra-regional trade in agricultural commodities and services in 2017.
The STC endorsed specific recommendations based on the findings of the reports. One
of the recommendations is that Member States requested the African Union and the
NEPAD Agency to mobilize technical and financial resources aiming at strengthening
country data systems, evidence-based planning and mutual accountability mechanisms
through capacity building programs and knowledge sharing among countries.

Food Security, Nutrition and Food Safety

126. In the past two years, African food security has been challenged by external
shocks, especially those related to climate change and variability. Most of African
countries have been experiencing unprecedented droughts, outbreaks of pests and
disease. The devastating fall army worm, for example, has been reported in about thirty
(30) countries. In addition to that, most parts of the continent are still affected by
conflicts which trigger food insecurity and malnutrition.

127. The Commission pursued several initiatives/projects whose objective was to
promote agricultural development, food security and nutrition through the Malabo-
CAADP Results Framework. This framework was designed to facilitate and expedite
implementation and track progress towards achieving the CAADP vision of ending
hunger by 2025. Remarkable progress was made in a number of areas.

128. The Commission deliberated on the three-year work plan for the African Union
Nutrition Champion with His Majesty King Letsie III of the Kingdom of Lesotho when he
visited the Commission in August 2017. The work plan aims to advance the
implementation of the revised Africa Regional Nutrition Strategy and provides a
roadmap that outlines the role of the Commission and other stakeholders in the
elimination of hunger and malnutrition in Africa. The Nutrition Champion is expected,
inter-alia, to promote the AU’s Africa Renewed Initiative for Stunting Elimination in Africa
-----------------------Page 40 End-----------------------

                                                                          EX.CL/1061(XXXII)
                                                                                   Page 38

(ARISE) and advocate for increased investment in nutrition which will include private
sector engagement in nutrition initiatives that build on studies on the Cost of Hunger in
Africa. The Champion will also render support to the initiative of the Chairperson of the
Commission to address nutrition and humanitarian needs in areas of conflict as well as
support the Commission’s sustainable school food and nutrition initiative which aims to
scale up continental school feeding programs.

129. Food security, nutrition and food safety are inextricably linked. Unsafe food
creates a vicious cycle of disease and malnutrition, particularly affecting infants, young
children, the elderly and the sick. Foodborne diseases impede socioeconomic
development by straining health care systems, and harming national economies,
tourism and food trade.

130. In Africa, food-borne diseases represent a serious health threat to millions of
people. Estimates show that more than 91 million people fall ill and 137 000 die each
year of food-borne illnesses, representing one-third of the global death toll from food-
borne pathogens. Diarrheal diseases alone are responsible for up to 70% of food-borne
diseases in Africa. Children under 5 years are the most affected, accounting for almost
33% of all food contamination deaths.

131. Several outbreaks of food-borne diseases such as cholera, shigellosis, konzo (an
acute paralysis caused by consumption of high cyanide cassava) and acute
aflatoxicosis continue to occur in several parts of the African continent. For example,
aflatoxins contribute to about 30% of liver cancer cases in Africa, making liver cancer
the number one cause of cancer mortality. The presence of chemical contaminants in
food and drinking water is another worrying development.

132. The burden of diseases due to contaminated food is highest in Africa. A
single food safety threat, such as aflatoxins, is estimated to cause damages of up to
25% of the world's food crops, resulting in large economic losses
in many developing countries. In Africa, losses in export trade earnings due to aflatoxins
are estimated at over USD 670 million. With the globalization of food trade, diseases
that happen in one part of the world can spread rapidly to other parts of the globe. The
global spread of food-borne diseases also results in bans in food trade, with loss of
market access and exports earnings. The African continent remains highly vulnerable to
all such threats.

133. The AU target, as contained in the Malabo Declarations, of tripling intra-regional
trade in agricultural commodities by 2025 will be difficult to realize as long as there is no
structured continental or regional mechanism to provide coordination or leadership on
food systems control in Africa. Food supply chains now cross multiple national
borders. However, Member States have different food control regimes which do not
achieve the same appropriate level of protection or facilitate intra-regional trade. In
addition, Member States and the RECs have commenced the implementation of
regional and national programmes to build sanitary and phytosanitary capacity,
-----------------------Page 41 End-----------------------

                                                                      EX.CL/1061(XXXII)
                                                                               Page 39

particularly in relation to food safety, but these programmes are proceeding at different
paces.

134. In recognition of these challenges, the AU-EU Heads of State and Government
decided, at the Lisbon Summit in 2007, to establish a continental food safety
body within the AU Commission to address food safety challenges on the continent. The
challenge is that Member States continue to experience serious difficulties in
implementing the reforms necessary to meet modern food safety requirements. On the
other hand, the RECs have not yet built their technical capacity to lead continent-wide
reforms on this issue. It is, therefore, imperative to ensure a uniform, coordinated
approach and harmonization of food safety standards across the continent. There is
also need to establish or strengthen government regulatory agencies on food safety as
well as enhance cooperation among Member States in order to ensure the production,
consumption and trade of safe foodstuffs across Africa and globally.

135. The AU Inter-African Bureau for Animal Resources (AU-IBAR) based in
Nairobi and the Inter- African Phytosanitary Council (AU-IAPSC) based in Yaoundé, are
mandated to coordinate animal and plant health measures. In 2012, the Commission
launched the Partnership for Aflatoxin Control in Africa (PACA), an initiative that aimed
to coordinate and support aflatoxin mitigation across the health, agriculture and trade
sectors in Africa. In addition, the Commission plans to co-organize with the FAO and
WHO, no later than in 2019, an International Food Safety Conference in line with the
high-level importance placed on food safety by the AU Policy Organs.

Development of Animal Resources

136. The Commission drafted standard operating procedures for the proper
management of gene banks, which include (i) technical, legal and administrative
procedures, and (ii) draft Material Transfer Agreements to enable the movement and
exchange of genetic materials among Member States. Approximately, 85 breeds of
cattle, sheep, goat, pig, poultry, camel grass-cutter and fish are being characterized.
Information sharing and debate on various aspects of Animal Genetics Resources
[AnGRs] management and development is on-going through the five regional Domestic
Animal Diversity Networks (DAD-NET). In view of the need to harmonize surveillance
and disease control, countries in the Greater Horn of Africa continued to implement the
Standards, Methods and Procedures [SMPs] frameworks for surveillance and disease
control related to trade. Uganda and South Central Somalia received laboratory
equipment and materials.

137. Dissemination and utilization of a laboratory manual on standard operation and
the development, validation and implementation of the quarantine standard operating
procedures were undertaken. Twenty-five (25) members of the National Livestock
Identification and Traceability Systems [LITS] teams from IGAD Member States were
trained on LITS application and implementation. In addition, 35 front-line actors were
trained on the use of mobile phone in disease reporting in Uganda as a pilot country. In
Kenya, South Sudan and Uganda, National Peste des Petits Ruminants [PPR] control

and eradication committees were established by the Directorates of Veterinary Services
with the Support of AU-IBAR within the framework of the surveillance for trade sensitive
diseases (STSD) Project.

138. The Commission disseminated scientific information for improved control of
tsetse, human and animal trypanosomiasis through the publication of volume 127 and
128 of the proceedings of the International Scientific Council for Trypanosomiasis
Research and Control (ISCTRC) conferences held in Khartoum in 2013 and Ndjamena
in 2015. This project has, among others, produced the following results: (i) the
development of a national livestock policies and animal welfare strategy for Africa; (ii)
the establishment of an African platform for animal welfare; (iii) the conduct of research
to provide evidence in support of policy decision-making; (iv) the update of national
veterinary legislation in beneficiary countries; and (v) the operationalization of
continental networks and regional animal health centers.

139. The Commission conducted a review of national and regional fish trade policies
and related frameworks for their harmonization in four regions: West, Central, East and
Southern Africa. It also helped to establish an African Women Fish Processors and
Traders Network for the purpose of encouraging women involved in this sector and
improve their share in intra-regional fish trade.

140. The NEPAD Agency launched the African Chapter of the World Aquaculture
Society at a high-level continental fish trade policy platform. Nineteen countries took
part in the launch, namely Benin, Cameroon, Chad, Congo, Ivory Coast, Democratic
Republic of the Congo, Egypt, Ghana, Guinea, Kenya, Liberia, Malawi, Nigeria,
Senegal, Sierra Leone, South Africa, Tanzania, Tunisia, and Uganda. The policy
platform focused on improving continental and regional trade in fish and fishery
products.

141. With respect to fish harvest and trade, the NEPAD Agency initiated the adoption
of regional certification, standards and regulations for areas that are critical for
promoting intra-regional fish trade. These included pre-assessment of shrimp for
certification standards using the Africa Eco Label Mechanism (AEM) in Nigeria, Gabon
and Cameroon. The Agency also helped boost the production of octopus in the Indian
Ocean through applied innovations, as well as modernize capacity and work
environments in post-harvest handling of fish products. In Guinea, for example, twenty
(20) officers received training in fish handling and sanitary control. In Côte d’Ivoire, the
impact of fish smoking on health was assessed and in Senegal, equipment for fish
handling and processing was purchased.

Climate Change Adaptation

142. In terms of climate change, Africa is the worst hit region, with recurring droughts,
floods and extreme heat. The reliance on climate sensitive sectors like agriculture,
raises the need for urgent actions to combat climate change and promote resilience on
the continent. To address these challenges, the Commission encouraged Member
States to adopt policies on climate change, disaster risks, land degradation, depletion of
natural resources and biodiversity.

143. African countries that are parties to the United Nations Framework Convention
on Climate Change (UNFCCC) began to implement the 2015 Paris Agreement. As of
October 2017, over 40 Member States had already ratified it and embarked on the
implementation of their nationally determined contributions.

144. The NEPAD Agency contributed to Africa’s unified position in global negotiations
on climate change through, among others, the provision of technical and financial
support to strategic platforms and to targeted groups. The latter included the African
Group of Negotiators in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change
(UNFCCC), the African Ministerial Conference on the Environment (AMCEN), and
African experts at the 23rd Conference of Parties (COP) during the United Nations
Conference on Climate Change in Bonn, Germany.

145. The Committee of African Heads of State and Government on Climate Change
(CAHOSCC) convened at the AU Permanent Observer Mission in New York on 18
September 2017, on the margins of the 72nd Session of the United Nations General
Assembly. The Committee assessed progress on Africa’s engagement in the global
climate change negotiations at the 22nd Conference of Parties to the UNFCCC
(COP22). It also defined strategies for Africa’s effective participation at the 23rd
Conference (COP23), which took place in Bonn, Germany, from 6 to 17 November
2017. CAHOSCC adopted these Messages, which encompassed the aspirations of
Africa, as a basis of negotiations at COP23. It also called for elaboration of a High-Level
Framework for monitoring and evaluating climate support, the acceleration of the
development of governance and institutional arrangements, as well as the operating
modalities for the Adaptation Fund to serve the Paris Agreement.

146. On 6 October 2017, the STC on Agriculture, Rural Development, Water and
Environment adopted the action plans for CAHOSCC Women and Gender Program on
Climate Change and for CAHOSCC Youth Program on Climate Change – which were
developed to implement the Malabo 2014 Decision on the High-Level Work Program on
Climate Change Action in Africa. The action plans will soon be submitted for the
consideration of CAHOSCC. Furthermore, the Commission continued to facilitate the
work of the African Group of Negotiators on Climate Change, the African Ministerial
Conference on Environment (AMCEN) and the Youth on climate change.

                                                                      EX.CL/1061(XXXII)
                                                                               Page 42


147. Similarly, the Commission finalized a draft program to secure the European
Union support under the Global Climate Change Alliance plus (GCCA+) in the 11th Intra
ACP-European Development Funds. This support aims to assist the Commission’s
capacity to coordinate, facilitate and advocate for the implementation of the 2015 Paris
Agreement in Africa by working with Member States on their nationally determined
contributions. It also aims to track implementation of the Paris Agreement in Africa
through a common reporting, monitoring and evaluation framework.

148. In 2017, the Commission focused on the need for Africa to strengthen its ability
to access reliable and near real time data and information for the environment
dimension of sustainable development. In this regard, the Commission supported the
efforts of the RECs to integrate earth observation in their regional development
planning. The Commission also facilitated the acquisition and installation by Member
States of strategic infrastructure for the access to, processing and disseminating of
satellite-based environmental and climate data.

149. So far, 49 Member States benefitted from this support, and over 1500 national
experts received the training. Member States now utilize satellite-based earth
observation technologies for the following: in their policy decision-making and their
development planning in agriculture and food security, climate monitoring, conservation,
coastal and marine resources management, disaster risks reduction, flood and drought
monitoring, water resources management, and land degradation mitigation. The
Commission will expand this support in the coming year. At the same time, Member
States should implement measures that will sustain this technological infrastructure and
retain national expertise in operating it.

Disaster Reduction

150. The Commission made significant strides in helping Member States build
national resilience to natural hazards. In January 2017, the Assembly endorsed the
Africa Program of Action for Disaster Risk Reduction, 2015-2030. The program of
action aims to facilitate the implementation of Sendai Framework, Africa Regional
Strategy for Disaster Risk Reduction and the Agenda 2063.

151. To enhance its capacity in implementing disaster risk reduction programs on the
continent, the Commission developed an African position on disaster risk reduction,
which was presented to the Global Platform on Disaster Risk Reduction held in Cancun,
Mexico, in May 2017. The Commission also drafted a roadmap for the creation of the
Africa Centre of Excellence for Disaster Risk Research, Prevention and Management.

152. In close collaboration with the Republic of Cameroon, the Commission initiated a
continental monitoring and reporting system for disaster risk management. The draft
Roadmap will be validated by the Africa Working Group on Disaster Risk Reduction in
March 2018. The Commission is coordinating implementation of a multi-million euro EU-
ACP resilience program on the continent as a contribution to strengthening the
-----------------------Page 45 End-----------------------

                                                                      EX.CL/1061(XXXII)
                                                                               Page 43

Commission’s capacity, the RECs and Member States on disaster risk reduction. Four
(4) RECs have already set up their disaster risk reduction structures. Twenty (20)
Member States established disaster-induced losses databases, and twelve (12)
developed risk profiles.

153. Although the Commission achieved tremendous progress in this area, much
remains to be done to strengthen the continent’s resilience to multi-faceted hazards
against the backdrop of an ever-changing climate coupled with rapid and unplanned
urbanization, and inadequate disaster early warning and response mechanisms. In the
coming year, the Commission will work with partners to accelerate the domestication
and implementation of the Africa Program of Action for Disaster Risk Reduction in
Member States and local communities, and support the development of Africa risk
assessment and reporting capacity. The Commission will also endeavour to help
Member States strengthen their disaster preparedness and recovery mechanisms,
especially those recovering from complex humanitarian disasters and vicious
vulnerability cycles.

154. To ensure resilience in agricultural production systems and livelihoods and
improved agricultural risk management, the Commission and the NEPAD Agency
provided technical support with guidance on mainstreaming adaptation to climate
change and resilience to the national agricultural investment plans. Gender experts from
five countries – Cameroon, Ethiopia, Malawi, Niger and Rwanda – also received training
on managing gender climate change agriculture.

155. Member States received technical support to mobilize resources for addressing
the challenges of adaptation to climate change. Furthermore, the Commission facilitated
various conferences to explore ways of enhancing the resilience of the agricultural
production systems and scaling up of good practices in climate-smart agriculture.
Initiatives were also underway to build the capacity of Member States to define proper
indicators and metrics for building resilience that can be used for the biennial review
and report.

AFRICAN RISK CAPACITY (ARC)

156. The African Risk Capacity (ARC) is a pan-African risk pool designed to help
Member States of the African Union to improve their capacities to plan, prepare and
respond to extreme weather events and natural disasters such as drought, floods and
cyclones. The work of the African Risk Capacity is undertaken by two entities: the ARC
Agency, a Specialized Agency of the African Union, and its financial affiliate, the ARC
Insurance Company Limited (ARC Ltd), a mutual insurance company. ARC Agency
provides capacity building services to Member States, as well as the political oversight
and strategic direction for ARC, while ARC Ltd carries out the insurance and risk
transfer functions of ARC.

157. ARC Agency was established by the Agreement for the Establishment of the
African Risk Capacity (ARC) Agency (the Treaty) in November 2012, pursuant to a
-----------------------Page 46 End-----------------------

                                                                         EX.CL/1061(XXXII)
                                                                                  Page 44

resolution adopted by the Fifth Joint African Union Conference of African Ministers of
Economy and Finance, and a subsequent decision by the African Union Assembly of
Heads of State and Government (Assembly/AU/Dec.417 (XIX)) on 16 July 2012.
Through these and other decisions, the African Union leadership expressed its desire to
develop an African solution to respond to the impacts of extreme weather events and
natural disasters by establishing a continental disaster risk financing mechanism. In
2013, ARC Agency spearheaded the establishment of ARC Ltd as a mutual insurance
company, pursuant to a decision of the ARC Agency Conference of the Parties (the
CoP).

158. In addition to fulfilling its mandate, the African Risk Capacity supports Agenda
2063 to minimize the vulnerability of people to natural disasters as part of a structural
transformation of Africa. Its work is also a major contributor to the continent’s efforts to
strengthen peace and security, by increasing the resilience of vulnerable people,
helping to safeguard the livelihoods of rural populations, thereby keeping people in their
communities during climate induced crisis because they are supported during difficult
times.

159. The activities of African Risk Capacity for the reporting period focused towards its
three key strategic objectives, namely research and development, scalability and
sustainability, and improvement of disaster risk management on the continent.

160. Research and Development: This programme focuses on developing and
continually improving ARC insurance products and other risk management tools so that
they continue to be relevant to ARC Member States. During the reporting period, ARC
continued to improve its core software product, Africa RiskView. It also made progress
on the development of a parametric insurance river flood model, as well as a product to
respond to the risk of outbreaks and epidemics.

161. Scalability and Sustainability: During the reporting period, ARC Agency
convened the fifth session of the Conference of the Parties in Abidjan in March 2017.
The ARC Agency Governing Board (the Board) met three times during the reporting
period. In addition to overseeing the activities of ARC Agency, the Board worked with
the ARC Ltd Board (collectively referred to as the Boards) to improve the governance
and operations of the ARC. Furthermore, ARC engaged more closely with the RECs
and contributing to international discussions on climate policy through the
InsuResilience initiative.

162. Improving Disaster Risk Management on the Continent: ARC advocated an
increase of the resources available to its Member States, including through discussions
with the African Development Bank and other partners to establish a premium financing
facility. ARC also continued to make progress on the Replica Initiative Pilot, under which
international organizations and non-governmental organizations can take out insurance
that matches the insurance taken by ARC Members, thereby contributing additional
resources to disaster response in ARC Member States.
-----------------------Page 47 End-----------------------

                                                                       EX.CL/1061(XXXII)
                                                                                Page 45

163. To date, eight countries have participated in ARC’s four drought risk pools, and
ARC Ltd has underwritten over USD $400 million of drought risk. African governments
paid US $52 million in insurance premiums. 95% of this amount came from national
budgets without any international support, thus demonstrating that there is a strong
interest among African countries in such instruments and in proactively managing risks.

164. ARC Ltd made insurance pay-outs of US $34 million to four countries: Malawi,
Mauritania, Niger and Senegal, supporting over 2 million people and 1 million livestock
through the scale-up of cash transfer, food distribution and subsidized livestock feeding
programmes. But ARC is not just about insurance. It is about advanced preparation and
improving risk management on the African continent.

165. As a Specialized Agency of the African Union, Africa Risk Capacity should be
fully involved in initiatives and work streams relating to its mandate when they are put
forward by other AU bodies, including: better integrated reporting; designations of ARC
Champions within the AU; and integration of ARC into the AU reform process.

166. Following ARC Member States’ decisions encouraging ratification of the Treaty,
eight (8) countries have completed, or made substantial progress on, the national
ratification process, but only 4 ARC Member States have completed the process at the
Commission level. The Treaty is currently in force provisionally and will not come into
force definitively until ten (10) instruments of ratification have been deposited with the
Commission.

167. Several Member States with low resilience faced serious resource constraints to
pay premiums to ARC Ltd and may require premium financing support. This facility will
support sustained pool growth in the early years, and, when tied to commitments on
embedding risk management in sovereign systems, will help the pool to become
sustainable in the medium term. The African Development Bank offered its support to
this endeavour, and ARC is also in discussions with multiple alternative channels,
including the Arab Bank for Economic Development in Africa, the Islamic Development
Bank and the European Union.

168. ARC proposes the following priority areas and recommendations for the
consideration of the Policy Organs:

      •     Emphasizing the work of the ARC Agency among Member States by,
            among others, establishing a ministerial committee to champion its
            mandate, increasing financial contribution to, and African ownership of, its
            programmes, and integrating ARC in the AU reform process;

      •     Encouraging more signatures and ratifications of the ARC Treaty by
            Member States so that they can benefit from ARC Agency membership,
            including access to services to help better prepare for and respond to
            natural disasters, and to address climate change;
-----------------------Page 48 End-----------------------

                                                                         EX.CL/1061(XXXII)
                                                                                  Page 46

      •     Further encouraging AU Member States, organs of the AU and other
            continental bodies to extend necessary support to and work with the ARC to
            improve responses to natural disasters on the continent, and, in particular to
            involve ARC in discussions, events and decisions relating to natural
            disaster risk, climate change and innovative finance;

      •     Requesting development finance institutions and partners to support this
            critical contribution to the continent’s disaster risk management and climate
            change adaptation infrastructure, including through premium support, and to
            channel their support to risk management in Africa through the ARC, an
            existing African-led institution;

Inviting donor partners to support coordination between ARC initiatives and the work of
the humanitarian community on the continent.

Land Policy

169. The Commission organized an inaugural Conference on Land Policy in Africa
(CLPA) on 14-17 November 2017, bringing together leading land African experts to
share research findings and good practices on key drivers of land policy development
and implementation. Land issues and governance are now being mainstreamed in
regional protocols and programs. As a result, there are dedicated or joint programs on
land governance by the RECs and other AU Organs like the Pan-African Parliament.
The Pan-African Farmers’ Organization, a key organization that informs policies on land
development, developed its work plan on land governance, and a continental platform of
civil society organizations on land governance is now in operation.

170. Africa has a better understanding of the factors that influence land-restoration.
Investors and other key stakeholders quantified national land-restoration targets based
on analyses of locally available maps. Twenty-four (24) Member States and
communities took part in this exercise. These countries are also participating in the 100
million hectare African Forest Landscape Restoration Initiative (AFR) project. Following
this initiative, millions of hectares of land on the continent have been committed for
restoration through the application of the restoration opportunities assessment
methodology.

171. During the reporting period, the following commitments were realized: Benin - 0.5
million ha, Burundi - 2 million ha, Cameroon - 12 million ha, CAR - 3.5 million ha, Chad -
1.4 million ha, Cote d’Ivoire - 5 million ha, DRC - 8 million ha, Ethiopia - 15 million ha,
Ghana - 2 million ha, Guinea - 2 million ha, Kenya - 5.1 million ha, Liberia - 1 million ha,
Madagascar - 4 million ha, Malawi - 4.5 million ha, Mozambique - 1 million ha, Niger -
3.2 million ha, Republic of Congo - 2 million ha, Rwanda - 2 million ha, South Africa -
3.6 million ha, and Uganda - 2.5 million ha.

172. On its part, the Commission put in place a Forum for African Seed Testing
(FAST), which aims to strengthen the capacity of African seed health laboratory
-----------------------Page 49 End-----------------------

                                                                      EX.CL/1061(XXXII)
                                                                               Page 47

scientists and facilitate the development of the Forum’s operationalization plan for
2015–2017.

Enhancement of Agri-Business

173. The Commission developed a draft policy framework on rural infrastructure and
access to markets, as well as a continental agribusiness strategy. These documents will
guide the agribusiness sector and add value to primary produce, generate employment
and income, thus contributing to economic growth and reduction of food dependency in
Africa.

174. The Continental Geographic Indications Strategy and its policy framework were
also adopted by the Second Ordinary Session of the STC on Agriculture, Rural
Development, Water and Environment in October 2017. Also adopted was its action
plan which will serve as a tool for sustainable rural development and transformation
within the context of the CAADP and Agenda 2063. The European Union had
expressed its desire to support the implementation of the action plan, while the STC
endorsed it as one of the deliverables for the November 2017 AU-EU Summit.

THE GREAT GREEN WALL FOR THE SAHARA AND SAHEL INITIATIVE

175. Encouraged by the positive impacts of implementing the Great Green Wall for the
Sahara and Sahel Initiative (GGWSSI) in the last ten years, the Commission extended
the Initiative to assist the Southern Africa region, which has been affected by some of
the worst drought, land degradation and desertification phenomena on the continent.
The launch of GGWSSI in Southern Africa provided a platform for exchange of best
practices and peer-to-peer learning among involved Member States and the RECs.

176. In collaboration with FAO and the African Development Bank, the Commission
initiated consultations that were aimed at promoting the development of renewable
energy within the framework of the Great Green Wall of the Sahara and the Sahel
Initiative, making use of the solar, wind and geothermal potential of the Member States.
In the same vein, the Commission is in contact with a Canadian-American group, the
Trans African Pipeline, for support in the implementation of a project to enable the
desalinization and use of the sea water for irrigation.

177. During the course of the year under review, the Commission worked with the
United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the World Bank (WB),
European Union (EU), the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), the
Permanent Inter-State Committee for the Control of Drought in the Sahel (CILSS) and
Sahara and Sahel Observatory (OSS) to support a number of sub-projects within the
initiative to enhance livelihoods. The increasing awareness of the nexus between
drought, land degradation, poverty, conflicts, internal displacements and migration
contributed to raising the profile of the Great Green Wall for the Sahara and the Sahel
Initiative regionally and globally.

                                                                       EX.CL/1061(XXXII)
                                                                                Page 48

178. Furthermore, the Commission provided substantial support to Member States in
their participation in the COP13, which resulted in the adoption of a separate strategic
objective on drought that will enable the UN Convention to Combat Desertification
(UNCCD) to support African countries to address with drought.

AU-SAFGRAD

179. The African Union’s Specialized Agency on Semi-Arid Food Grains Research
and Development (SAFGRAD) is actively involved in enhancing regional partnerships
and networks, providing support to Member States in their efforts to promote agricultural
research for development and building resilience of rural livelihoods in semi-arid zones
of Africa.

180. SAFGRAD worked with its partners to strengthen the capacity of Member States,
the RECs and other relevant actors on the resilience to climate change and
desertification. It partnered with the Ministry of Water Resources and Irrigation of Egypt
and the Arab Fund for Technical Assistance for African Countries to train young
researchers from fifteen (15) Member States in the area of modern irrigation. SAGFRAD
also conducted policy dialogue in combating desertification in Africa, in collaboration
with the government of Burkina Faso and the UNCCD. It published research on
challenges and opportunities in agricultural value chains in Africa. SARGRAD also
coordinated the adoption of the African common position for the UNCCD-Conference of
the Parties (COP13) held in China, in September 2017.

181. Furthermore, through SAFGRAD, the RECs had an opportunity to identify the
main challenges and opportunities of strategic value chains development in their
respective regions, and agree on the main criteria for the prioritization of agricultural
commodities. The activities of the Agency also included linking the Pan-African
Farmers’ Organization with the research and extension services at national, regional
and continental levels.

Output 1: Enabling policy frameworks for inclusive development formulated,
promoted and implementation capacity of Member States enhanced

182. The Commission has set for itself the ambition of building for Africa by the year
2030 an integrated infrastructure of transport, energy and communications that is safe,
reliable, efficient and affordable, capable of promoting regional and continental
integration and sustainable development of the continent. This is a long-term aspiration
focuses on the key challenges facing the continent, namely, its integration, economic
and social development and its full participation in the global economy.

183. To fulfil this aspiration, the Policy Organs adopted several key instruments –
decisions, declarations and frameworks – on infrastructure and energy programs and
projects, which the Commission had since been implementing. They include the
following: (i) the 2014-2017 Strategic Plan and Agenda 2063 First Ten-Year Plan; (ii)

                                                                                Page 50

Declarations of AU Assembly on Transport and Energy and ICT Development in Africa;
(iii) Declaration of the 4th Africa-EU Summit; (iv) Transport, Energy and ICT sector and
sub-sector Declarations, Decisions and Plans of Action; and (v) Program for
Infrastructure Development in Africa (PIDA).

Output 2: Program for Infrastructure Development in Africa facilitated

184. The Program for Infrastructure Development in Africa (PIDA) is the main cross-
cutting activity of the Commission in partnership with the United Nations Economic
Commission for Africa, the African Development Bank and the NEPAD Planning and
Coordinating Agency (NPCA). It is designed to help address the infrastructure deficit in
transport, energy, ICT and trans-boundary water. PIDA provides a common continental
strategic framework and blue-print for inter-connecting and integrating Africa through
priority infrastructure programs and projects and aims to boost trade, spark growth and
jobs, and unleash Africa’s economic and social transformation. The PIDA Priority Plan
of Action (PAP) is composed of 51 actionable projects and programs of transport,
energy, ICT and trans-boundary water. Its implementation will promote regional
integration between 2012 and 2020.

185. Activities carried out in the context of PIDA in 2017 included: (i) the completion
of the 3rd PIDA ICT Priority Action Plan (ICT PAP3) related to internet exchange points
(IXPs) in thirty-three (33) Member States; (ii) the adoption by the NEPAD Infrastructure
Projects Preparation Funds (NEPAD-IPPF) of a prioritized and sequenced pipeline of
regional infrastructure projects for possible support by NEPAD-IPPF for the five-year
period, 2016-2020, and enhanced working modalities between NEPAD-IPPF and
stakeholders to ensure coordinated and results-driven partnerships to strengthen
project preparation and delivery and measures to enhance resource mobilization; (iii)
capacity-building funded by the African Development Bank and the German
Government for implementing PIDA projects, including provision for a period of three
years of experts for RECs to support PIDA projects preparation and experts for NPCA
and AUC for PIDA management.

186. There were, however, some challenges, namely weak resource mobilization for
project preparation, particularly of domestic resources, and delays in agreements
between countries and non-alignment of legal and regulatory frameworks for concerned
countries. Going forward, efforts will focus on the finalization of the PIDA mid-term
review whose outcome is expected to be submitted to the AU Policy Organs at the July
2018 Summit.

Output 3: Access to modern energy services for the majority of the African
          population enhanced

187. In the energy sector, the focus of the Commission was on the following main
areas of activity: (i) the operationalization and implementation of Africa Renewable
Energy Initiative (AREI) adopted at the COP21 in Paris in December 2015; (ii)
facilitation of Sustainable Energy for All (SE4ALL); (iii) advocacy for the implementation
-----------------------Page 53 End-----------------------

                                                                       EX.CL/1061(XXXII)
                                                                                Page 51

of the Africa Bioenergy Policy Framework and Guidelines; (iv) elaboration of a
Continental Harmonized Regulatory Framework for the Energy Sector; (v)
implementation of the Africa-EU Energy Partnership; (vi) implementation of the Regional
Geothermal Program and establishment of the Geothermal Risk Mitigation Facility
(GRMF); (vii) implementation of the Hydropower 2020 Initiatives, including advocacy for
the development of Inga Hydropower project as part of Agenda 2063.

188. Achievements in 2017 included: (i) operationalization, with the support of AU
partners, of Africa Renewable Energy Initiative (AREI) by developing its governance
structure documents and staffing its technical experts and Board of Directors; (ii) follow
up and facilitation of the implementation of the Sustainable Energy for All Initiative by
developing its Action Agendas and Investment Prospectus for several Member States;
(iii) finalization and validation of the strategy document and action plan for the
harmonization of regulatory frameworks, which was adopted by the Ministers at the
STC- on Transport, Transcontinental and Interregional Infrastructures, Energy and
Tourism (STC-TTIIET) first meeting in Lomé in March 2017; (iv) launch of the second
phase of the study on harmonized tariff along transmission lines, policy in mini-grid and
establishment of Coordination Unit; (v) Support to Member States in preparing
bioenergy projects and mobilization of resources for project development.

189. The Commission also partnered with the German Ministry for economic
cooperation and the EU-Africa Infrastructure Trust Fund in the establishment of
Geothermal Risk Mitigation Facility (GRMF). The Commission supported 26 projects in
five countries in East Africa with total grant amount of USD 80 million. The Commission
also provided technical and financial support to the Agency for the Development and
Promotion of the Grand Inga Project (Agence pour le Développement et la Promotion
du Projet Grand Inga) established in the Office of the President of the DRC. It also
assisted in the convening of the first STC on Energy, Transport and Tourism held in
Lomé in March 2017.

190. In the energy sub-sector, implementation arrangements began in 2017 for the
design of a rooftop solar system to power government buildings in Madagascar. A
renewable energy access program was launched and implementation began for the
thirty-three (33) high priority renewable energy projects that were identified. The
Gambia, Kenya and Tanzania received technical and financial support from the NEPAD
Agency to undertake a feasibility study on renewable energy financing. Madagascar
also received assistance for a similar study for rooftop solar systems.

191. In general, however, limited financial resources and the lack of data on the
energy sector in many African countries remains a major challenge for tracking progress
in this sector. With the upsurge of international attention to African energy issues,
ranging from initiatives such as the United Nations-led Sustainable Energy for All
(SE4All), the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG7) and the African Renewable
Energy Initiative (AREI), there is an urgent need for Member States to enhance their
ability to collect and disseminate accurate data on their energy needs, potential and
-----------------------Page 54 End-----------------------

                                                                       EX.CL/1061(XXXII)
                                                                                Page 52

consumption. Furthermore, Member States are encouraged to adopt national policies
on renewable energy, including bioenergy.

AFRICAN ENERGY COMMISSION (AFREC)

192. The activities of the African Energy Commission (AFREC) in 2017 focused
mainly on developing the African Energy Information System and Database to facilitate
the exchange of information among Member States, as well as among the RECs.. The
African Energy Commission was thus able to disseminate energy statistics data and
contribute to the preparation of the International Energy Agency’s 2017 World Energy
Statistics as well as the Africa Energy Outlook 2040. AFREC contributed to the
preparation of the 2017 African Statistical Year Book, within a joint project of the
Commission, the African Development Bank and the UN Economic Commission for
Africa.

193. Training and capacity building for national focal points were also among the
activities of the African Energy Commission during 2017. These activities helped
improve the competency of hundreds of statistical experts and, thus, the production of
reliable energy data by Member States. 81 statisticians from Member States, the RECs,
Regional Power Pools and Regional Centers for Renewable Energy and Energy
Efficiency participated in these sessions. In addition, 28 national focal points recently
nominated by African Energy Ministers for collecting energy statistics database and
energy balance also benefitted from AFREC expertise. In collaboration with the Joint
Organization Data Initiative (JODI), AFREC trained 25 African energy experts in the
collection of monthly oil and gas data for the African Oil and Gas producing countries. It
also provided a one-month internship to two Master’s degree students from the Pan-
African University of Water and Energy Sciences based in Tlemcen, Algeria.

194. Some of the challenges AFREC had to deal with include difficulty in retaining the
services of national focal points, and limited funding for training.

AFRICAN ELECTRO-TECHNICAL STANDARDIZATION COMMISSION (AFSEC)

195. The African Electro-Technical Standardization Commission (AFSEC) was
established with the support of the Commission to provide a collaborative framework for
stakeholders in Member States, through their national electro-technical committees, and
to harmonize electro-technical standards and the associated conformity assessment
requirements of Africa.

196. During 2017, there was an increase in membership from eleven (11) full
members at the end of 2016 to fifteen (15) in 2017. Additionally, 80% of Member States
endorsed the AFSEC standards after the commissioning of the AFSEC database in the
middle of the year. The number of standards approved for common adoption now
exceeds 140, while their actual appropriateness and need is still to be tested over time.
-----------------------Page 55 End-----------------------

                                                                        EX.CL/1061(XXXII)
                                                                                 Page 53

Output 4: Policy and standards to promote continental integration facilitated

197. Single African Air Transport Market Project: The Assembly, at its 24th
Ordinary Session in January 2015, adopted the Declaration on implementation of the
Yamoussoukro Decision towards establishment of a Single African Air Transport Market
(SAATM) by 2017, as well as the Solemn Commitment made by eleven (11) Champion
States towards advancing concrete and unconditional implementation of the
Yamoussoukro Decision and the Single African Air Transport Market. At the time of
finalizing this report, twelve (12) more Member States had joined the initial eleven (11)
to reach twenty-three (23) States.

198. A Ministerial Working Group was set-up with three main functions: (i) to lead the
implementation process in their States, (ii) to provide guidance, and (iii) to spearhead
the advocacy campaign to urge the rest of the Member States to join the single market
and ensure the right conditions are established in their State. The Ministerial Working
Group elaborated an activity road-map for establishing the single air transport market,
including resource mobilization for the start-up activities of the Executing Agency, and
its launching in 2017.

199. The Commission is pleased to report that the launching of the Single African Air
Transport Market will now take place at the January 2018 Summit. The regulatory and
institutional texts of the Yamoussoukro Decision, which also constitute the regulatory
and management framework of the single air transport market, were cleared by the STC
on Justice and Legal Affairs (STC-JLA) and would be submitted to the AU Assembly of
January 2018 for adoption. The Commission commends the twenty-three Member
States that are currently implementing or have implemented the Yamoussoukro
Decision and urges the rest to do the same without delay. It has taken too long for this
great initiative to enter into force. Yet it is a critical vector towards Africa’s economic
integration and a powerful lever for Africa’s economic growth and development. In a
globalized, rapidly transforming world, Africa will survive only if united.

200. The launch of the Single African Air Transport Market will hopefully increase
membership but also accelerate the mobilization of adequate resources for the full
implementation of the initiative, especially the elaboration of a continental aviation
infrastructure master plan.

201. African Integrated High Speed Railway Network: The Africa Integrated High
Speed Railway Network (AIHSRN) Project is designed to interconnect African capitals,
economic and other industrial hubs and major tourism locations with appropriate high
speed rail technology, with complementary electrical power and ICT broadband
infrastructure and services. It is another flagship of the AU Agenda 2063 whose
implementation is due during its first ten years.

202. Current and planned activities in this area include: (i) conducting a
comprehensive pre-feasibility study of the project – the procurement of consultancy
services for a preceding detailed scoping study was almost finalized at the time this
-----------------------Page 56 End-----------------------

                                                                          EX.CL/1061(XXXII)
                                                                                   Page 54

report was completed; (ii) finalizing the concept note and assessment of training needs;
and (iii) drafting the preliminary action plan for the industry scope including its local
content.

203. However, the main challenge was to determine the feasibility of the project. To
address it, the Commission initiated a detailed scoping study which is in progress,
following which there will be a need to mobilize substantial human and financial
resources for a full feasibility study of the project across the continent.

204. In line with the AU integration agenda, the NEPAD Agency initiated a campaign
to increase the allocation of African assets to African infrastructure. The target is to
increase the allocations from the current base of approximately 1.5% of assets under
management (AUM) to 5%. A roadmap was drawn, showing feasible steps to increase
the African Pension and Sovereign Wealth Fund (SWF) investment in African
infrastructure to the target of 5%. The roadmap also includes a defined pathway for
setting up and coordinating a Co-Investment Platform for African Pension and SWF
investment in African infrastructure. The campaign was carried out at various platforms,
including the Continental Business Network Meeting at the 72 nd UN General Assembly
meeting.

205. Support to the Program on Transport Sector Development in Africa: This
activity was completed in July 2017. To recall, this program was launched in April 2015
with financial support from the European Union. It had two packages: Lot 1 for support
to the Commission’s Department of Infrastructure and Energy and the PIDA-Pan-African
Parliament Smart Corridors activities with two components; and Lot 2 for the editing and
publishing of comprehensive transport sector guidelines. This task was successfully
completed in November 2016.

206. Under Lot 1 Component 1: the Commission completed the drafting of the
following frameworks: (i) a continental transport sector policy paper; (ii) capacity building
(transport knowledge portal and terms of references); transport sector governance; (iii)
transport infrastructure financing and public-private partnership options, (iv) road
maintenance; and (v) sustainable transport and climate change challenges.

207. In Lot 1 Component 2: support was given to PIDA and Pan-African Parliament for
the start-up of Smart Corridors activities. It was completed with the following notable
outputs: (i) corridor assessment (Smart Corridor definition and characteristics); (ii)
corridor coordination and management; and (iii) design and costing of the Pilot Smart
Corridors for implementation (North-South and Dar es Salaam corridors).

208. Furthermore, under component 1, the program also provided support to the
Department of Infrastructure and Energy in accomplishing some of its major activities,
including dissemination of harmonized road standards for trans-African highways and
the African Road Safety Charter, and facilitating the logistical support for the STC
meeting and at the Joint AU-EU Strategy Infrastructure Reference Group (IRG) which
met in March 2017.

                                                                        EX.CL/1061(XXXII)
                                                                                 Page 55


209. Lack of adequate resources, including staffing, and delays in approving program
events, especially some validation workshops, led to postponement and even
cancellation of many important activities. However, in 2018, the Commission will make
every effort to convene continental validation workshop for the transport policy
framework and submit it for the consideration of the Policy Organs. The Commission will
also follow up with the RECs regarding the implementation of the SMART Corridors
project.

210. Information and Communication Technologies: The key activities in the ICT
sector in 2017 were as follows:

      i)     Harmonization of policies and regulations:
             Terms of reference (TORs) were drafted and negotiations concluded with
             the European Commission on the funding of a project related to capacity
             building on internet governance and on a digital platform for regulators for 5
             million euros. This project, called “Policy and Regulation for ICT
             Development in Africa” (PRIDA), should start in January 2018.

      ii)    The African Internet Exchange System (AXIS):
             Worth mentioning here is the continuation of the implementation of the
             African Internet Exchange System (AXIS) project financed by Euro-Africa
             Infrastructure Trust Fund and the Government of Luxembourg, whose
             objective is to keep Africa’s internet traffic local to the continent by
             facilitating the establishment of national internet exchange points and
             regional internet exchange points in Africa.

             The following activities were completed in 2017: (i) development of the East
             African Community (EAC) cross-border interconnection regulations and the
             Southern African Development Community (SADC) interconnection policy
             framework; (ii) establishment of eight (8) internet exchange points (IXPs)
             with financial grants to grow into Regional Internet Exchange Points
             (RIXPs); (iii) two (2) national Internet Exchange Points were set-up, adding
             to the previous 14 IXP and increasing the total number of internet exchange
             points on the continent from 18 to 34 Member States.

      iii)   The Pan African e-network (PAeN):
             During 2017, the Commission continued the implementation of the action
             plan for the sustainability of the PAeN. As of March 2017, the
             implementation status was as follows: (i) forty-eight (48) Member States had
             signed an agreement to participate in the project; (ii) a satellite hub-earth
             station in Dakar and up to 150 VSAT equipment were installed as follows:
             three VSAT in each of the 48 participating country, one in AUC, 5 in the five
             selected Super Hospitals and 5 in the five leading universities, all selected
             after an open bid; (iii) 22,000 students enrolled in 39 user countries in
             various undergraduate and graduate programs in different Indian
-----------------------Page 58 End-----------------------

                                                                   EX.CL/1061(XXXII)
                                                                            Page 56

       universities graduated through the network; and (iv) 771 telemedicine
       consultations and 6771 continuous medical education (CME) sessions were
       conducted.

       In April 2017, the Commission received a notification from the Government
       of India that it had decided to close the existing satellite VSAT and hub
       station operations effective 1 July 2017. The Commission transferred the
       hub station infrastructure from Dakar to the AU Headquarters after a hand-
       over process signed by the parties in August 2017. Subsequently, the
       Commission signed another agreement with the Republic of Senegal on the
       PAeN hub station custody. Consultations are ongoing between the
       Commission and Member States to find a strategy for the use of the hub
       station handed over to the Commission.

iv)    Cybersecurity: The Commission organized two (2) workshops for internal
       staff on e-governance and cybersecurity through funding and expertise both
       by Estonia and Sofrecom. It developed an explanation guide (toolkit) of the
       AU Convention on Cybersecurity and Personal Data Protection (Malabo
       Convention) and produced a booklet for dissemination to Member States.
       The Commission also completed a comprehensive study on the status of
       cybersecurity and cybercrime in Africa and in cooperation with Information
       Society (ISOC), a global cause-driven organization governed by a diverse
       Board of Trustees based in Reston, Virginia, USA. With the African
       Regional Bureau, the Commission developed guidelines on security of
       internet infrastructure in Africa. In the promotion of its initiatives on
       cybersecurity, the Commission collaborated with the US Department of
       State, the Government of France, the Council of Europe, the Organization
       of American States, and the Global Forum from Cybersecurity Expertise
       (GFCE).

v)     The NEPAD Agency developed a cybersecurity assessment framework
       which was submitted to the ministers responsible for communication and
       information technology. Currently, nine (9) countries – Benin, Chad, Congo,
       Ghana, Guinea Bissau, Mauritania, Sierra Leone, Sao Tome and Principe,
       and Zambia – have signed the Malabo Convention and two (2) - Senegal
       and Guinea - have ratified it. The Malabo Convention will come into force
       after a minimum of fifteen (15) ratifications.

vi)    Dot Africa: After eight (8) years of technical and legal battle, the Dot Africa
       was finally delegated to ZACR/RA (ZA Central Registry, the administrator of
       the South African internet domain names), the operator sponsored by the
       Commission following an open bid process – and launched on 10 March
       2017. A roadshow for the promotion of Dot Africa was also launched during
       the July 2017 Summit.
vii)   The Commission developed guidelines for the harmonized use of the digital
       dividend spectrum in Africa. Furthermore, in collaboration with the African
-----------------------Page 59 End-----------------------

                                                                       EX.CL/1061(XXXII)
                                                                                Page 57

            Telecommunication Union, the Commission developed a common African
            position in relation to spectrum re-allocation for the upcoming World Radio
            Communication Conference (WRC-19) in Egypt, from 28 October to 22
            November 2019.

      viii) Internet governance: The Commission worked with major African
            stakeholders to prepare a draft Declaration on Internet Governance. It will
            be submitted to the Second Session of the STC on Communication and
            Information & Communication Technologies for endorsement and onward
            transmission for the Assembly’s consideration.

      ix)   A framework for driving the digital transformation agenda in Africa has also
            been defined, with an initial focus on trade. Priority in 2018 will focus on
            building capacity on the continent to access open data and data centers as
            a foundation for entrepreneurship and job creation.

      x)    Postal Sector: The Commission focused its work on the implementation of
            the Declaration of the 14th Assembly on ICT which, in relation to
            Telecoms/ICT development policies and strategies, gave particular attention
            to the postal sector.

      xi)   Achievements in this area included the preparation of the evaluation of the
            implementation of the Action Plan adopted in 2008 for the Sustainable
            Development of Postal Sector in Africa, and submission of ad hoc reports
            on various issues: (i) on postcode systems to the STC on Public Services,
            Local Government, Urban Development and Decentralization; and on
            leveraging postal networks to foster socio-economic development in rural
            areas through electrification and connectivity of post offices to the STC on
            Finance, Economic Planning and Integration, as well as the STC on
            Transport, Transcontinental and Interregional Infrastructures, Energy and
            Tourism.

Output 5: Trade and customs facilitation policies developed and promoted and
          CFTA negotiations facilitated

211. Customs Cooperation and Trade Facilitation: In the area of customs
cooperation and trade facilitation, the Commission continued to facilitate meetings of the
AU Subcommittee of Directors-General of Customs. These meetings proposed a
number of recommendations that were subsequently adopted by both the STC on
Trade, Industry and Mineral Resources, and the STC on Finance, Monetary Affairs,
Economic Planning and Integration.

212. The Commission held consultative meetings with Customs Departments of the
RECs with the aim to enhance cooperation in the spirit of the Abuja Treaty. This allowed
the Commission and the RECs to share their experience in the implementation of their
-----------------------Page 60 End-----------------------

                                                                      EX.CL/1061(XXXII)
                                                                               Page 58

work programs to avoid duplication and channel resources to needy areas on customs
and trade facilitation.

213. In order to facilitate the movement of goods and people across national borders
with minimum hurdles, and enhance exchange of information between respective
customs administrations, the Commission worked with Member States and the RECs on
the modalities of interconnectivity of computerized customs clearance and information
systems. A roadmap and draft strategy are already in place and under implementation.
In November 2017, a Memorandum of Understanding with the African Alliance on e-
Commerce was signed on the margins of the meeting of the Sub-Committee of
Directors General of Customs in Yaoundé.

214. As part of its efforts to promote trade facilitation on the continent, the
Commission organized the 3rd Customs Experts Trade Facilitation Forum in Africa. The
Forum was attended by Customs Experts from AU Member States, representatives of
the private sector, civil society, RECs and cooperating partners. Participants shared
experiences and best practices on trade facilitation and were briefed on the boosting
Intra-African Trade (BIAT) programme, as well as on the implementation of the WTO
Trade Facilitation Agreement.

215. On its part, and with a view to ensuring that customs procedures are consistent
with the CFTA, the Commission carried out a study of customs procedures and
cooperation, trade facilitation and transit instruments in Member States. The study
provided the status of implementation of customs instruments in Africa and highlighted
existing gaps with respect to custom cooperation, trade facilitation and transit. It also
identified areas of convergence and divergence while providing necessary information
on areas of focused interventions.

216. The coming into force of the WTO Agreement on Trade Facilitation in February
2017 was an important milestone of the Doha Development Agenda. The Agreement
seeks to promote faster movement of goods and people across national borders,
reduce transaction costs and encourage cooperation between and among various
border agencies. To date, 22 out of 44 African WTO members have ratified the
Agreement.

217. In this regard, the Commission convened the 1st Extraordinary Meeting of the AU
Subcommittee of Directors-General of Customs in Abuja in May 2017, on the theme
“Entry into Force of the World Trade Organization Trade Facilitation Agreement (WTO
TFA) - Implications for the African Customs Administrations.” The Sub-Committee, inter
alia, recommended that Member States should endeavor to employ a regional approach
in the implementation of the WTO Agreement and that Customs Administrations should
continue to share best practices in the implementation of trade facilitation measures.

218. In the same vein, the Commission organized the Second Annual Trade
Facilitation Forum in Port Louis, Mauritius, in September 2017, where it provided a
progress report on the process of developing an AU Trade Facilitation Strategy with the
-----------------------Page 61 End-----------------------

                                                                         EX.CL/1061(XXXII)
                                                                                  Page 59

main objectives of assisting AU Member States to positively respond both to the
implementation of the WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement, the Action Plan on Boosting
Intra-African Trade, and the Continental Free Trade Area.

219. Intra-African Trade and CFTA Negotiations: On intra-African trade, the
Commission made recommendations to the Policy Organs on the implementation of the
Action Plan for Boosting intra-African Trade (BIAT). These recommendations related to
trade policy, trade finance and trade information clusters. Going forward, the
Commission will work with Member States, the RECs and cooperating partners to
develop comprehensive programs aimed at addressing the impediments to intra-African
trade.

220. The Commission also continued to support Member States’ negotiations on the
CFTA and coordinate their discussions on its legal instruments. The Commission
regularly provided technical and administrative assistance and carried out technical
studies as requested by the CFTA negotiating institutions. Of note is the facilitation by
the Commission of a common understanding with the seven countries that had
expressed reservations on the level of ambition of 90% on modalities on trade in goods.
This assistance resulted in the development of a draft Addendum to the Modalities on
Trade in Goods for the Champion of the CFTA Process, H.E. President Mahmadou
Issoufou of the Republic of Niger, to use when engaging the Heads of State and
Government of those seven countries.

221. It should be recalled that during the 29th Ordinary Summit of Heads of State and
Government in July 2017, President Mahmadou Issoufou informed the Assembly that
AU Ministers of Trade approved the modalities for the CFTA tariff liberalization and
trade in services negotiations. He also reported that the Ministers had agreed on an
ambitious target of 90% for tariff liberalization, which takes into account the overall goal
of an integrated continent. President Mahmadou Issoufou also pointed out that seven
Member States had registered reservations on the level of ambition of 90 percent,
proposing instead 85 percent in view of their economic circumstances.

222. The Commission also helped Member States reach a consensus on the form and
structure of the CFTA Agreement, the level of liberalization ambition under the CFTA,
as well as the development of draft texts of the Agreement, its Protocols and
Appendices, which were either completed or in the final phases of negotiations by the
end of 2017.

223. Ministers of Trade met in Niamey in December 2017 to review the draft legal
texts and prepare their report to the AU Policy Organs. At the time of writing this report,
the Ministers had adopted the draft Agreement on the CFTA and the Protocol on Trade
in Services. These will be submitted to the Assembly at the 2018 January Summit
during which the Assembly is expected to launch the CFTA. Negotiations will resume
thereafter with a view to finalizing the draft Protocol on Services by March 2018. Also,
an extraordinary session of the STC on Justice and Legal Affairs was planned to review
-----------------------Page 62 End-----------------------

                                                                       EX.CL/1061(XXXII)
                                                                                Page 60

the legal aspects and finalize the draft Agreement, Protocols and Appendices before
their submission to the Assembly.

224. The Commission expresses its gratitude to Member States for their substantial
financial contribution to the CFTA project. This includes USD 3 million in 2016, USD 4.9
million and a supplementary contribution of USD 3 million in 2017, and USD 7.4 Million
in the 2018 budget. It also includes contributions in-kind through the hosting of meetings
and sponsorship of technical experts and delegates participating in all meetings.

225. By creating one single market through the CFTA, Africa is at a historic juncture to
change economic relations among all the countries of the continent and position itself to
overcome the historical legacy of marginalization in the global economic system. The
CFTA will expand in scale and competitiveness; and in the process, position Africa to be
a major trading and investment hub.

226.   There are, however, some urgent tasks ahead for Member States. They include:

       •    Need for expeditious ratification of the CFTA Agreement. The CFTA is
            expected to come into force after 15 Member States have ratified it;

       •    Setting up the secretariat shortly after the Agreement comes into force. The
            secretariat will develop the program of work for the CFTA;

       •    Immediate commencement of the Phase Two negotiations covering
            Investment; Intellectual Property Rights (IPR); and Competition Policy after
            adoption of the Phase One package at the January 2018 Summit;

       •    Provision of adequate financial support of the CFTA process due to the fact
            that support from cooperating partners will come to an end very soon. State
            Parties to the CFTA Agreement need to take full ownership on the CFTA.
            This is in line with the African Union Institutional Reforms aimed, at among
            others, making the African Union and its organs become self-financing.

227. With regard to international trade, the Commission supported Member States in
their preparations of the 16th AGOA Forum that took place in Lomé, Togo, from 7 to 10
August 2017. The Commission also helped to coordinate an African common position in
the preparation of the 11th World Trade Organization (WTO) Ministerial Conference that
took place in Buenos Aries, Argentina, from 10 to 13 December 2017. The Commission
will serve as a platform for Member States to coordinate their approach for the
implementation of Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs) and trade relations with
the European Union after the expiry of the Cotonou Agreement in 2020.
-----------------------Page 63 End-----------------------

                                                                       EX.CL/1061(XXXII)
                                                                                Page 61

Output 6: Policies for private sector engagement and improved business climate
          developed and promoted

228. During the year under review, the Commission continued to implement the Action
Plan for Accelerated Industrial Development of Africa (AIDA), notably by addressing
supply-side constraints which constitute a persistent obstacle for African industrial
development and, therefore, require the attention of Member States in creating a
coherent policy environment conducive for a better business climate. Along with the
African Mining Vision (AMV) and the AIDA, the Commission continued the development
of the AU Commodities Strategy, which is one of the flagship projects of Agenda 29063.
The outputs will be submitted to the Policy Organs in 2018.

229. Deepening the engagement with the African private sector remains a strategic
priority for the African Union. In this regard, the Commission worked with various private
sector stakeholders on the establishment of the African Business Council (ABC). The
first Trade Policy Dialogue took place in Addis Ababa in November 2017, as part of the
process of establishing the BIAT/CFTA architecture currently under development.

230. The Commission also reached out to the Pan African Chambers of Commerce
and Industry (PACCI) and the Afro-Champions Club. A draft concept note was prepared
with the support of the International Trade Centre (ITC) to facilitate development of a
resource mobilization strategy for the Pan African Trade Observatory (PATO), which will
serve as a repository of information about trade and industry in Africa. We anticipate the
establishment of the Pan-African Trade Observatory in 2018.

Output 7: Women, youth and persons with disabilities entrepreneurship
          promoted and supported

231. As requested by the Assembly, the Commission identified several actions to
tackle the prevalent underemployment in Africa, particularly with a focus on the informal
economy where women and the youth are dominant. According to the International
Monetary Fund, the average share of the informal sector in AU Member States reached
almost 38% of the GDP during the 2010–2014 period, and close to 50% in oil exporter
countries. The Commission began working on an initiative to transform the informal
economy to the formal economy through decent work and the extension of social
security to workers and their dependents in the informal and rural economy sectors.

232. The Commission also developed the Mid-Term Plan of Industrial Development
Small and Medium Enterprises (SME) Strategy and Master Plan 2017-2021. This
strategy aims to promote entrepreneurship and industrial development on the continent.
Together with the Master-Plan, it is designed to utilize the potential of small and
medium-sized enterprises and industries (SME/Is), as well as microenterprises (informal
sector) and entrepreneurs to create employment and promote intra-regional and intra-
African trade by integrating African small and medium enterprises and industries into
regional and global value chains.
-----------------------Page 64 End-----------------------

                                                                        EX.CL/1061(XXXII)
                                                                                 Page 62

233. The vision is to develop competitive, diversified and sustainable economies
underpinned by dynamic, entrepreneurial and industrial sectors that generate
employment, reduce poverty and foster social inclusion, as well as innovation and
business incubation. This strategy will be submitted for the consideration of the
Assembly in 2018, after its endorsement by the STC on Trade, Industry and Mineral
Resources.

234. The Commission also developed a roadmap on the establishment of the
Enterprise Africa Network, a small and medium enterprise online platform through
public-private partnership. In addition, during the First African Union Symposium on
Special Economic Zones (SEZs) and Industrial Development, the Commission
developed a policy paper on Special Economic Zones Development in Africa and an
Action Plan for the creation of an African Platform of Special Economic Zones. The
Commission is also developing a roadmap on how to support start-ups as part of youth
and women economic empowerment and entrepreneurship.

235. The NEPAD Agency, on its part, prepared business incubators for women
empowerment. It provided technical and financial support to Burkina Faso and Liberia
within the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), and Sudan, Kenya,
Swaziland and Burundi within the Common Market for East and Southern Africa
(COMESA). The project will impact more than 50 000 women and youth, and will be
scaled-up to more countries on the continent.

236. The NEPAD Agency began the implementation of phase 1 of the Africa Solidarity
Trust Fund in four countries: Benin, Cameroon, Malawi and Niger. Skills-gap analyses
were conducted to identify existing policies and stakeholders for the development of
national action plans for youth. Furthermore, partnerships with local training institutions
have been fostered, and training began for the first cohort of students. To facilitate the
exchange of good practices, communities of practice and data collection on youth
employment on the continent via a Skills Portal for Youth Employment (SPYE) have
been developed.

Output 8: Policies for sustainable utilization of mineral resources and other
          resources developed and promoted

237. The Commission continued supporting Member States in the implementation of
the Africa Mining Vision (AMV) that was adopted by African Heads of State and
Government in 2009. The Vision continues to be Africa’s blueprint for cooperation in
mineral resources and for transparent, equitable and optimal exploitation of mineral
resources to underpin broad-based sustainable growth and socio-economic
development.

238. The African Minerals Development Centre (AMDC) is the Specialized Agency in
charge of coordinating the implementation of the Africa Mining Vision. Its statute was
adopted in 2016 and the AMDC is now transitioning into a permanent structure of the
African Union. Five countries – Guinea, Kenya, Mali, Sudan and Zambia – have offered
-----------------------Page 65 End-----------------------

                                                                       EX.CL/1061(XXXII)
                                                                                Page 63

to host it. The evaluation was completed, and the report will be submitted to the Policy
Organs at the January 2018 Summit. The Commission urges Member States to
expedite the signature and ratification of the AMDC Statute in order to have it fully
operational as an AU institution.

239. With regard to the Mining Legal Regimes and Regulatory Frameworks, the
Commission continued to work on the African Mining Legislation Atlas (AMLA) in
partnership with the African Legal Support Facility (ALSF) and the assistance of a
consortium of other partners, including the World Bank. The objective of the AMLA is to
assist Member States to review their mining laws and mining codes in line with the
Africa Mining Vision. This project also provides capacity building as well as a guiding
template during the review process.

240. Along the same line, the Commission prepared the Model Law for Mineral
Resources Development in line with the Assembly’s decision – Assembly/AU/Dec.605
(XXVII) of July 2016 in Kigali – requesting the Commission to provide guidance to
Member States in reviewing their royalties and fiscal regimes. The Commission also
worked on a Geological and Minerals Information Systems (GMIS) Strategy that will
coordinate all the continental GMIS initiatives and programs. Related to this, the
Commission continued its activities under the joint AU-World Bank African Minerals
Geoscience Initiative (AMGI), which was endorsed by the Assembly in January 2015.
The following projects are currently under implementation: the Pan African geo-scientific
knowledge and skills in African Geological Surveys (PanAfGeo), the AMGI Pilot Project;
and the African Resources Geoscience Initiative (ARGI).

241. Regarding Mineral Resource Governance, the Commission developed an African
Mineral Resource Governance Framework (AMGF) which is ready for implementation
after the endorsement of the Specialized Technical Committee on Trade, Industry and
Mineral Resources.

242. The NEPAD Agency contributed to increased awareness and strengthened
competence among key actors in contract negotiations and tax policies related to the
extractive and mining industry. Various platforms, such as the 3 rd regional dialogue on
contract negotiations, were used to strengthen capacities in eleven (11) countries,
namely: Angola, Botswana, Cameroon, DRC, Djibouti, Ethiopia, Guinea, Kenya, Malawi,
Sudan and Tanzania.

243. The Commission also facilitated the development of the AMV Private Sector
Compact that will provide a framework for broader partnership and mutual trust between
the public and private sectors. This was validated and endorsed by the newly
established continental Association of Chamber of Mines and other Mining Associations
in Africa (ACMMAA). The buy-in of the private sector is critical for ensuring that optimal
mutual benefits will accrue for all stakeholders and help reduce the endemic illicit
financial flows from Africa.

244. In addition, the Commission partnered with UNDP in the Development Minerals
Program. This is an African Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) Capacity Building Project
being implemented by UNDP and the ACP Secretariat. It is within the EU-Africa
Strategy and supports the development of the ‘Development Minerals’ that were
previously known as low value minerals and materials (LVMM). These natural resources
– industrial minerals, building and construction materials, gem stones and lime, inter alia
– have the potential to stimulate intra-Africa trade and boost development through
employment creation at the local and sub-regional levels for millions of people.
Conservative estimates indicate that more than 8 million people in Africa are engaged in
this sector, with women making up more than 40 percent of the work force. Forty ACP
members, of which 25 from Africa, are set to benefit from this program.

                                 OUTCOME 4:
                         EDUCATION AND HEALTH FOR ALL

245. Policies and programmes to enhance access to health, education and
employable skills underpinned by investment in services, science, research and
innovation implemented by Member States

OUTPUTS:

      •     Implementation of the African Health Strategy promoted;

      •     Strategies for quality education, skills development and services,
            particularly for women and youth designed and promoted;

      •     Policies and strategic programmes for investment in science, research and
            innovation designed and promoted to enhance Africa’s global
            competitiveness;

      •     Framework for social security and protection of vulnerable groups
            promoted.

Output 1: Implementation of the African Health Strategy promoted

246. Health: The campaign for the reduction of maternal mortality in Africa
(CARMMA) gained momentum in 2017. As part of the 2017 CARMMA Week
commemorations, the Commission initiated a preliminary evaluation to determine its
impact and sustainability nine (9) years after its official launch. The evaluation will also
determine how the campaign should move forward within the context of Agenda 2063.

247. The Commission, in collaboration with the Republic of the Sudan, organized in
August in Khartoum a high-level CARMMA event for North African countries. On that
occasion, the Republic of the Sudan also launched its own CARMMA campaign, making
it the 47th Member State to do so. And the Republic of Cape Verde did so in November
2017, to become the 48th Member State. Going forward, the Commission will intensify
its engagement with the remaining Member States to launch their CARMMA process.
We look forward to working together towards ending preventable maternal and child
morality by 2030.

248. Nutrition: Following the extension of the mandate of the AU Nutrition Champion,
His Majesty King Letsie III of the Kingdom of Lesotho, from January 2017 to January
2020, the Commission held discussions on his new three-year work plan during his visit
to the Commission in August 2017. The work plan aims to advance the implementation
of the revised Africa Regional Nutrition Strategy and provide a roadmap that outlines the
role of the Commission and other stakeholders in the elimination of hunger and
malnutrition in Africa.

                                                                      EX.CL/1061(XXXII)
                                                                               Page 66


249. Population: With the fifth anniversary of the Addis Ababa Declaration on
Population and Development (AADPD) coming up in 2018/19, consultations have
started between the key stakeholders – the Commission, UNECA and UNFPA – about
the need for a comprehensive review of the implementation of AADPD and concrete
suggestions on how to move forward.

250. HIV/AIDS, TB, Malaria and Other Infectious Diseases: The Technical Advisory
Group was established to advise the Commission on the development of the Scorecard
on Domestic Financing for Health. Advocacy on the elimination of mother to child
transmission of HIV (eMTCT) has been given prominence. In the context of 2030
targets and “leaving no one behind” AU-Aids Watch Africa (AWA) joined the
Organization of the African First Ladies Against HIV/AIDS (OAFLA) to lead the Africa
Campaign on eMTCT. African First Ladies will be the champions for domestic financing
for eMTCT and the attainment of related targets by 2030. Their efforts will be
complemented by the Digital Campaign that is running for two years (2017-2019). The
Africa eMTCT campaign will be launched in 2018 during the OAFLA General Assembly.

251. Five communities of practice were set up in 2017 to facilitate knowledge sharing
in the following areas: mining, regulation and occupational health; continuum of care for
TB and occupational lung diseases; laboratory strengthening and surveillance; TB
research monitoring and evaluation; and the economics of TB and sustainable financing
for health.

252. Centres of excellence were also established for TB control. Lesotho is hosting a
Centre of Excellence on Community-Based Management of TB, and Malawi one
Community TB Care and Integrated Disease Surveillance. Mozambique houses a
Centre of Excellence on Multi-Drug-Resistant (MDR) TB and Childhood TB
Management, while Zambia is host to a Centre of Excellence on Occupational Health
and Safety.

253. The NEPAD Agency also provided assistance in identifying cross-border disease
surveillance zones for disease surveillance along shared borders and facilitation of
information sharing as well as capacity building amongst the countries. The zones are in
Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia and
Zimbabwe.

254. Ahead of the UNGASS high-level meeting on tuberculosis in 2018 and the Global
Ministerial Conference in Moscow next year, the Commission, through the Department
of Social Affairs, prepared the Common African Position on TB (CAP-TB) to build
consensus among AU leaders on the priorities on TB during the implementation of the
SDGs. Cognizant that HIV infection rate is still high in Africa, a prevention advocacy
session was organized at the International Conference on Aids and Sexually
Transmitted Infections (ICASA) in December 2017. AIDS Watch Africa’s strategic
framework (2016-2030) was adopted by the Assembly in 2017.
-----------------------Page 69 End-----------------------

                                                                       EX.CL/1061(XXXII)
                                                                                Page 67

255. There is increased awareness and renewed commitment by Member States, the
RECs, the private sector and civil society to tackle tuberculosis (TB) as a national and
regional challenge, with a target of eradicating the scourge by 2030. The fight against
TB will target particularly vulnerable groups such as mining communities, front-line
actors in the transport industry, and migrant communities. The NEPAD Agency
supported these efforts through awareness drives and the provision of policy and
technical information during the African Union’s commemoration of World TB Day in
March 2017 that was run under the theme “United and Renewed Action to end TB”.

256. The current upsurge in disease outbreaks calls for strengthened health systems
and elaborated health emergency preparedness plans at the national level. Domestic
financing for health should therefore remain a high priority. Funding for HIV/AIDS, TB
and Malaria declined by almost 50% over the past two years, owing to a shift of focus
among donors.

257. Additionally, Member States should strengthen their capacity for local production
of medicines in order to achieve universal access by African citizens to essential
medicines. As part of the efforts to ensure the supply of safe and effective medicines in
Africa, the NEPAD Agency prepared a draft treaty for establishing the African Medicines
Agency (AMA) for endorsement by the Policy Organs. This followed a series of
consultative meetings with legal and medicines regulatory experts from 33 countries.
Twelve (12) Member States – Côte d’Ivoire, Burkina Faso, the Seychelles, Zimbabwe,
Lesotho, Namibia, Swaziland, the Gambia, Tanzania, Rwanda, Burundi and
Mozambique – had either reviewed or were in the process of reviewing their national
laws on medicines regulation - in line with the AU Model Law. Additionally, the
Commission facilitated the identification of opportunities to expand national and regional
capacity to scale up pharmaceutical manufacturing across Africa. These were
presented during the First Continental Forum on Access to Medicines and Heath
Commodities held in December 2017.

258. Africa Centre for Disease Control: The Africa CDC was officially launched on
31 January 2017 by H.E President of Guinea and Chairperson of the African Union, Prof
Alpha Conde, and H.E. Dr. Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, former Chairperson of the AU
Commission.

259. Regional visits were subsequently conducted to the five Africa CDC Regional
Collaborating Centres (RCCs) in West, East, Southern, Central and North Africa. The
Africa CDC and host countries agreed on the governing structure of the RCCs and the
priority public health activities for the regions. They also assessed regional assets and
capacities at the disposal of the RCCs. The Africa CDC, in collaboration with the
Commission’s Department of Human Resources, Science and Technology (HRST),
deployed 35 youth volunteers to support the operationalization of the RCCs and
strengthen their initial capacity.

260. One major function of the Africa CDC is to support Member States during
outbreaks. In 2017, the Africa CDC deployed epidemiologists to countries in Africa to
-----------------------Page 70 End-----------------------

                                                                         EX.CL/1061(XXXII)
                                                                                  Page 68

assist outbreak investigation and response efforts. These include lassa fever, meningitis
and monkey pox in Nigeria, ebola virus disease and cholera in the DRC, malaria control
in Namibia and Mozambique, cholera in Ethiopia, plague in Madagascar and the
mudslide disaster in Sierra Leone. During these deployments, Africa CDC
epidemiologists assisted the countries in strengthening surveillance, outbreak response
and emergency operating centre capacities. They also helped develop epidemiological
bulletins and disease monitoring dashboards in addition to conducting surveillance data
analysis and training and support to health systems strengthening.

261. To strengthen partnership and collaboration with other partners working on public
health in Africa, the Africa CDC participated in different workshops and trainings
organized by partners.

262. During the year under review, the operating budget and staffing of the Africa
CDC were very minimal. This constraint limited its ability to carry out its mandated
activities in support of the efforts of Member States to strengthen their health systems
and capacity during disease outbreaks. There is therefore a need to (i) adequately equip
and staff the RCCs, (ii) fast track the signing of host agreement for those RCCs which
have not signed yet, and (iii) support the full operationalization of the RCCs. Furthermore,
the Africa CDC should be better introduced across the different Policy Organs to create
awareness of its existence and functionality.

Output 2: Strategies for quality education, skills development and services,
          particularly for women and youth designed and promoted.

CESA IMPLEMENTATION

263. The objective of the Continental Education Strategy for Africa (CESA) is to
ensure quality transformative education and lifelong learning opportunities for all as a
human right, as well as the development and retention of African intellectual capital and
human resources through harmonized education systems and intra-African networking.
Implementation of the CESA is coordinated through a coalition of partners and
stakeholders working on education in Africa. The Commission has established several
thematic clusters based on CESA Objectives, which bring together Member States with
agencies and experts working in those particular areas to develop and implement
transformative education programmes. The establishment of an African Education
Fund, initially called for by the Assembly in 2007, was reiterated in 2017 for
implementation of CESA by Member States attending the ADEA Triennial Conference
on Education. The AfDB is carrying out a feasibility study on the proposal.

264. The STC on Education, Science and Technology (STC-EST) held its second
meeting in Cairo, Egypt, in October 2017. It called on Member States and Regional
Economic Communities to (i) popularize the Continental Education Strategy for Africa
as Africa’s domestication of the global SDG 4 and Education 2030; (ii) support the work
of the Commission and assign the responsibility of Focal Agency for CESA to National
UNESCO Commissions in order to promote alignment of the local, continental and
-----------------------Page 71 End-----------------------

                                                                       EX.CL/1061(XXXII)
                                                                                Page 69

global frameworks; (iii) participate in cluster activities and share experience and better
practices in major areas of CESA.

265. The STC also decided to strengthen TVET, school feeding, a culture of reading,
the promotion of African writers and African content in education curricula. Member
States were requested to utilize the UNESCO General History of Africa manuals in
schools and colleges.

266.   The following were some of the achievements under this output:

267. Higher Education: The Higher Education Cluster was launched in 2017 and is
coordinated by the Association of African Universities (AAU) with the support of the
International Network for Higher Education in Africa (INHEA).

268. The AU African Quality Rating Mechanism (AQRM) for facilitation of a culture
of continuous quality improvement in African higher education institutions, through self-
evaluation and external validation, is now available for full scale implementation,
following extensive piloting with over 40 Universities.

269. The Pan-African Quality Assurance and Accreditation Framework (PAQAF)
was developed towards establishing a Continental Accreditation Agency for higher
education. It was validated by national and regional quality assurance agencies and
adopted by the 2016 January Summit. An African Credit Transfer System has been
developed and is undergoing peer review.

270. The Mwalimu Nyerere African Union Scholarship Scheme for young people
to study science based programmes at Masters and PhD levels in African countries
outside of their own, continued to award students every year since 2012. In 2017, the
focus was on education sciences. So far, students from nearly 40 Member States have
benefitted from this scheme, with special calls being made for female applicants and
students living with physical disabilities.

271. The Intra-African Academic Mobility Scheme, launched in 2010 as an
extension of the Mwalimu Nyerere Scholarship Scheme, completed its 3 rd Call in 2017.
Currently, 72 universities are participating, thus facilitating mobility for over 1,000
students and 140 academic staff.

272. It is worth noting that the STC on Education, Science and Technology also called
on Member States to publicise widely the education and other opportunities offered by
the AU Commission so that all African citizens can benefit. More importantly, Member
States are encouraged to ratify the Addis Ababa Convention for mutual recognition
of degrees and certificates.

273. Pan-African Virtual and e-University: The Pan African Virtual University
(PAVU), also called the African Virtual and E-University is designed to accelerate the
development of human capital, science and technology and innovation through
-----------------------Page 72 End-----------------------

                                                                        EX.CL/1061(XXXII)
                                                                                 Page 70

increasing access to tertiary and continuing education. In 2017, the PAU Council
adopted e-University as its open and e-learning arm. Niche areas for operationalization
of the project include managing the common courses of the PAU; teacher development,
and other degree programmes, certificate courses and executive education.

274. Teacher Development: Africa’s education system is short of over two million
teachers. Additionally, a significant number of existing teachers are either underqualified
or untrained, with serious shortages in Science, Technology, Engineering and
Mathematics (STEM) subjects and certain geographic areas. The Teacher Development
Cluster is coordinated by the UNESCO International Institute for Capacity Building in
Africa (IICBA), and Education International, with support from the African Federation of
Teacher Associations. During its meeting in Cairo, Egypt, in October 2017, the STC-
EST 2 commended the study carried out by the Commission on Teacher Training,
Working and Living Conditions in Member States and endorsed all its
recommendations, including the need to professionalize teaching, develop a continental
teacher mobility protocol and establish a Teachers without Borders Corps; promote
teacher motivation, and develop teacher standards and Qualification Frameworks at
continental regional and national levels. The STC also called for the establishment of an
AU Teachers Prize.

275. STEM Education: Scientific literacy is critical for employability, innovation and
entrepreneurship in the 21st century. Enhancing STEM education for all is therefore a
priority for the Commission. However, STEM education is undermined by inadequacies
in teacher preparation and in the instructional materials. A STEM Cluster was launched
in 2017 to further STEM education in Africa and placed under the coordination of the
African Institute for Mathematical Sciences, the African Academy of Sciences, and the
Centre for Strengthening Science and Math Education in Africa (CEMASTEA).

276. ICT in Education: The ICT Cluster was also launched in 2016 and is
coordinated by the Global E-Schools and Communities Initiative (GESCI) with strong
support of the @Edu Sustainable Education organization. The African Digital School
Initiative was launched in 80 high schools in Kenya. Two learning activities were
organized in 2017, including a mission to Portugal where participants from twenty (20)
Member States were exposed to the acclaimed Portuguese process of digitization of
schools and communities. The second activity was a meeting in New York which
facilitated engagement with key agents of ICT and digitization of education, where
important partnerships were forged to assist Member States efforts in promoting ICT in
education. The African Ministerial Forum on ICT in Education and training is scheduled
for February 2018 in Rabat, Morocco.

277. Peace and Education: The Cluster was also launched in 2017 and is
coordinated by Save the Children International. It cuts across several Departments of
the Commission. Its objective is to encourage the endorsement and implementation of
the tenets of the Safe Schools Declaration and other related instruments which Member
States have already ratified; to promote peace education and use of education to
prevent violent extremism and radicalization, and to promote media literacy and critical
-----------------------Page 73 End-----------------------

                                                                        EX.CL/1061(XXXII)
                                                                                 Page 71

thinking for pan African citizenship. There is need to establish safe school requirements
such as appropriate standards for infrastructure, school environment safety and
management.

278. School Feeding: Hunger and poverty are among the many factors that
negatively affect the performance of children in school as well as their retention and
ability to access and complete their education. The Assembly, at its January 2016
session, declared the 1st of March as African School Feeding Day. In 2017, this day was
observed in Congo Brazzaville, while Zimbabwe has offered to host the 2018 event.
With support from World Food Programme (WFP), the Commission completed a
continental study on school feeding in Member States. The Commission also launched
the School Feeding Cluster with WFP as coordinator. A multi-sectoral and multi-partner
committee was set up to promote Home Grown School Feeding. The Commission urges
Member States to implement innovative domestic financing and effectual multi-sectoral
programming that will bring together different concerned ministries, including the
ministries in charge of education, agriculture, health and nutrition, social affairs, youth
development, finance, to harness the multifaceted benefits of Home Grown School
feeding.

279. Education Management Information Systems (EMIS): EMIS is a critical tool
for ensuring quality education development and the realization of the skills revolution.
The Commission initiated staff recruitment for the Education Observatory at IPED in
Kinshasa, DRC. Software and other tools for data collection, rescue and analysis have
been developed, and will be ‘piloted’ in willing Member States preceding capacity
building and full scale implementation. The CESA monitoring and implementation
framework has been adopted through discussions with major stakeholders. The
Education Planning Cluster has now been launched, and the Commission has produced
the CESA Indicators Manual to be used by Member States, RECs and agencies to
monitor and generate quality timely data on the education system.

280. However, it should be pointed out that IPED still owes USD 3 million to its former
staff. Moreover, the host agreement with the Government of the Democratic Republic of
the Congo needs to be reviewed before the situation is conducive for work.

281. Capacity Building Trainings in Legal Affairs: Working with its partners, the
Commission, through the Office of the Legal Counsel, conducted capacity building
programmes for Member States, including on humanitarian law and policy; the rule of
law in conflict, instability and peacebuilding; and international and African Union law.

282. The Commission established an Africa-wide legal capacity development initiative
known as the Legal Associates Programme (LAP), located in the Office of the Legal
Counsel. The essence of this programme is to provide young Africans lawyers with
professional legal expertise in the area of African integration law. Now in its third year,
the programme will bring additional ten (10) young African lawyers (two from each AU
region in equal gender distribution).

                                                                                Page 72

283. In collaboration with the Loyola University Chicago School of Law, the
Commission offered young professionals from within the Commission, AU Organs,
Member States and the RECs a one (1) year scholarship to gain a Master’s Degree in
Rule of Law for Development at the Loyola University Chicago’s John Felice Rome
Center in Italy. This unique program develops leaders to advance social justice across
the globe, through effective, sustainable governance and rule of law reform. Currently in
its third year, the programme has benefitted sixteen (16) officials from Member States
while an additional five (5) have been admitted into the 2017/2018 academic year

284. Technical Vocational Education and Training: The NEPAD Agency launched
the Skills Initiative for Africa (SIFA) program in four pilot countries, namely Cameroon,
Kenya, Nigeria and Tunisia, to support technical and vocational education and training
to increase employment opportunities.

285. The NEPAD Agency also assisted in the design of a curriculum on Agriculture
Technical and Vocational Education Training (ATVET) that is tailored to the country’s
skills needs and based on its high-priority value chains. In Kenya, the focus is on dairy,
horticulture and aquaculture. In Malawi, the value chains of mangoes, pineapples and
aquaculture were selected. In Ghana, the focus was on pineapples and citrus, while in
Benin, rice and meat (chicken, pork, sheep) were the selected value chains. In Burkina
Faso, the focus was on rice, sesame and cashew, while in Togo, it was rice and
aquaculture. Accordingly, a total of 250 training modules have been developed for 10
agricultural value chains. Training modules are not only skills-based; they also address
specific occupations within a value chain. To date, over 6200 students from Kenya,
Ghana, Benin, Malawi, Burkina Faso and Togo have received training. The
competencies for women in rural regions in vocational activities related to agriculture
were also emphasized through knowledge sharing and the development of practical
guidelines for women in ATVET.

286. A study on gender stereotyping in technical vocational education and training
outlined some of the factors, myths, and educational practices that hinder access,
retention, and success of girls in male-dominated TVET programmes. The study
suggested that STEMitization of the curriculum from the lower levels of the education
system would empower and expose young girls to a wider array of vocational careers
outside the traditionally female-dominated occupations. Targeted research on the role of
parents, peers, role models, culture and tradition on the choice of TVET programmes by
girls will provide more evidence-based information and data to minimise gender
stereotyping in TVET.

Technology and Innovation Strategy for Africa (STISA-2024). Activities included the
following:

288. Launch of AU Kwame Nkrumah Science Awards: The rules of procedure for
the Kwame Nkrumah Scientific awards were reviewed and applied to the 2017 edition.
Awards for the regional and continental editions were to be presented in December and
at the January Summit, respectively.

289. The African Union Research Grant Programme: In 2017, the AU Research
Grant programme received 265 proposals on the theme of Sustainable Agriculture.
Assessment of the proposals by external assessors continued throughout the year. Nine
institutions in a partnership network of over 27 collaborating institutions were selected to
be awarded grants ranging from USD 500,000 to USD1 million by December 2017. The
programme is currently being audited. Another research call on the theme of
“agriculture and food systems for nutrition” will be launched as soon as the audit was
concluded.

290. AU-EU High Level Policy Dialogue on Science, Technology and Innovation:
The Commission and the EU are partners on Science, Technology and Innovation. In
2017, the two institutions conducted a joint review of the implementation status of the
first joint project on Food and Nutrition Security and Sustainable Agriculture (FNSSA).
They also agreed on a second roadmap on Climate Change and Sustainable Energy
(CCSE) that was expected to be endorsed during the AU-EU Summit in Abidjan in
November 2017.

291. African Union High Level Panel Report on Emerging Technologies: In a bid
to advise Member States on how Africa should harness emerging technologies for
economic development, the AU High-Level Panel on Emerging Technologies (APET)
produced a progress report with recommendations on the first three technologies
namely: gene drive for control and elimination of malaria; drones in the horizon and
transforming Africa’s agriculture and micro-grid to empower communities in Africa.

292. Global Monitoring for Environment and Security in Africa: The first phase of
Global Monitoring of Environment and Security & Africa (GMES & Africa) support
program was operationalized in May 2017 with the launching of an open call for
proposals. At the time of this reporting, the Commission was preparing to issue grants
to the successful Regional Implementation Centers. Several implementation
arrangements, including data sharing cooperation with the European Commission
space systems, were identified to facilitate the implementation process.

THE AFRICAN SPACE AGENCY (ASA)

293. Following the adoption of the African Space Policy and Strategy, the Commission
worked with Space Experts from Member States to develop the Draft Statute for African
Space Agency. The draft was considered by the Specialized Technical Committee on
Education, Science and Technology (STC-EST) in October 2017. The Commission has

                                                                               Page 74

opened applications for interested Member States to host the African Space Agency. In
parallel, a series of instruments were developed to assess the African space
technological heritage.

AFRICAN OBSERVATORY FOR SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION
(AOSTI)

294. During 2017, AOSTI, based in Malabo, Equatorial Guinea, implemented its
programmes on the Strengths and Weaknesses of the ECOWAS, SADC and ECCAS in
Scientific Production (2008-2013). Assistance was also extended to the Republics of
Seychelles and Equatorial Guinea in collecting data, building and using adequate S&T
indicators for policy making. Additionally, the Operational Model for the Monitoring &
Evaluation (M&E) Framework of the Implementation of STISA-24 was developed. The
process of strengthening national innovation systems as part of the implementation of
STISA-24 started with the ECCAS member states. It aims to enable them identify their
capabilities in science, technology and innovation, and strengthen their skills in policy
formulation and evaluation in line with national, regional and continental development
plans.

295. The first activity took place in N’Djamena in May 2017. So far, three training
workshops have been organized in Gabon, the Republic of Democratic Republic of
Congo, and Chad, respectively. The training in Cameroon was scheduled for November
2017. In total, 75 representatives of the innovation systems in these countries were
trained on methodological frameworks and their use in measuring macroeconomic
performance and framework conditions for innovation.

296. On its part, the NEPAD Agency continued its interactions with the Committee of
Ten (10) Heads of State – Egypt, Tunisia, Gabon, Chad, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Kenya,
Mauritius, Namibia and Malawi – who were designated to champion education, science
and technology through technical briefs. In turn, the Committee provided policy
guidance to specialised institutions such as the Coalition of African Research and
Innovation (CARI) and the African Institute for Mathematical Sciences (AIMS).

297. This interaction resulted in the improvement of science, technology and
innovation (STI) data systems among four (4) countries, namely Equatorial Guinea,
Ghana, Cote d’Ivoire and the Seychelles through skills training and in-country capacity
building on the use of new and innovative data collection tools, data analysis, storage
and dissemination. The Republic of Seychelles, for example, undertook its first national
research and development (R&D) and innovation survey using in-country expertise.
Equatorial Guinea also embarked on preparations to conduct its first national R&D and
innovation survey, slated for 2018. A continental-level validation exercise was followed
by two in-country validation sessions held in Swaziland and the Seychelles. Initiatives
were also underway to strengthen the linkages between R&D investments and national
strategic goals in Botswana, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Zambia, Zimbabwe,
Ethiopia, Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda. The NEPAD Agency provided
technical support to senior Science Granting Councils (SGC) officials to assess the

relevance of STI policies and devise appropriate advocacy strategies for increased
research, development and innovation.

AFRICAN UNION SCIENTIFIC, TECHNICAL AND RESEARCH COMMISSION (AU-
STRC)

298. Work on the second phase of the AU Network of Sciences (AUNS), which
requires development of the Network’s portal, modules, data base and digital library is
ongoing. A working group on mitigating the impact of natural hazards with the
participation of scientists from Africa, the African Diaspora and the EU was put in place
to focus on seismic and volcanic hazard, as well as climate change mitigation and
adaptation. The first meeting on mitigating the impact of natural risks in Africa was co-
organized by AU-STRC, UNESCO and National Research Institute of Astronomy and
Geophysics of Egypt in October 2017. Additionally, a delegation from the Lancaster
University and STRC had a bilateral meeting on cooperation in October 2017 on
modalities of institutional capacity-building; and building research leadership initiative
through the enhancement of high level research and development skills in African
academia. The Commission and the Lancaster University agreed to jointly organize in
September 2018 the first Africa Conference on academia, industry and policy makers
and lunch the Lancaster AU-STRC innovation award.

299. It should be noted, however, that the AU-STRC had never received any AU
funding for its programmes since 2012. Its operational budget, which amounts to about
USD1.4 million USD, is funded by the Federal Government of Nigeria. As a result, the
STRC faced serious challenges to run its programmes and activities. As a way forward
on this issue, the STRC submitted to the Commission a proposal for an alternative
source of fund on utilizing its owned properties in Lagos. The proposal is under
consideration.

AFRICAN UNION – INTERNATIONAL CENTRE FOR THE EDUCATION OF GIRLS
AND WOMEN (AU-CIEFFA)

300. The High-Level Dialogue on "Gender Equality and Education" was held in
January 2017 in the margins of the 28th AU Summit. In May 2017, the Commission
organized in Burkina Faso a dialogue with the local leaders on retention of girls at
school. The goal was to work with community leaders to identify the obstacles to girls'
education and retention at school, drawing upon their experiences to implement
innovative approaches to eradicate these barriers.

301. During the breakfast meeting on "Reaping Demographic Dividend: Why Invest In
Girls’ Education", which the Commission held in the margins of the 29th Summit in
June 2017, pledges were made for further investments in girls and women’s education,
and for developing policies underlying return on investment in human capital as the
main actor of development.

302. A forum also took place in Mauritius in July 2017 on strategies for retention and
completion of girls and young women in the educational system. Previous meetings had
underlined the challenges faced in retaining learners at all levels and the “how” in the
process of bringing solutions to the challenges. Beyond sharing experience, testimonies
were delivered by female role models

YOUTH EMPOWERMENT

303. The year 2017 was placed under the theme Harnessing the Demographic
Dividend through Investment in the Youth. The theme was officially launched at the 28th
Ordinary Session of the AU Assembly in January 2017. H.E. President Idriss Déby Itno
was nominated as the Leader of the Theme of the year and tasked to champion its
implementation. Young people from all over Africa played an important role in the
launch of the Theme and presented copies of the AU Demographic Dividend Roadmap
to Heads of State and Government.

304. The Roadmap is anchored on four thematic pillars: (i) employment and
entrepreneurship; (ii) education and skills development; (iii) health and well-being; and
(iv) rights, governance and youth empowerment. The logo for the Theme of the year
was selected from a competitive logo competition of African youth. The winning logo
was developed by a Zimbabwean.

305. To ensure effectiveness in coordinating the commemoration of the Theme and
implementation of the Roadmap at the continental level, the Commission set up a
Technical Steering Committee chaired by the Department of Human Resources,
Science and Technology (HRST) and comprising other Departments within the
Commission. This technical body has taken the lead in the implementation of the
continental agenda on the demographic dividend. It also aims to sustain an effective
model of resource engagement towards positive youth development agenda, and
strengthen youth contribution in advocacy initiatives at regional and continental level. To
ensure harmonization and synergy of the activities, and to avoid duplication among
partners, an integrated Continental Demographic Dividend work-plan was developed in
line with the thematic pillars.

306. The Commission also developed an integrated Demographic Dividend Work plan
that identified the activities of all partners on the theme of the year in line with the
Roadmap. The work plan facilitated the synchronization of activities among various
partners and avoided duplication and the existence of parallel processes.

307. The roadmap mandated launching of the Theme of the year at country level
through multi-stakeholder engagements. The national launches and consultations are to
guide and facilitate the preparation of National Demographic Dividend Roadmaps. So
far, only Burundi, Congo (Republic of), Guinea and Sierra Leone, Nigeria, Ghana have

launched the theme at country level. The development of national demographic
dividend profiles aims to enhance informed decision-making and planning and to define
country-specific responses.

308. In addition to the implementation of the Theme of the year, the Commission
carried out the following activities on youth empowerment:

309. Youth Development Mainstreaming Framework: The Commission set up an
inter-departmental task team to spearhead youth development mainstreaming and the
demographic dividend agenda throughout the Union. Implementation guidelines and
reporting tools were developed to ensure periodic reporting, monitoring and evaluation
of the progress made on youth matters. The guidelines are part of the mandate to
implement the Youth Decade Plan of Action (2009-2018) of the Africa Youth Charter.


310. Youth Plug-in Initiative: The Youth Plug-In Initiative is a project of the
Commission and the European Union to create a process that actively involves the
youth on both continents as "agenda-setters". It comprises a group of 36 young people
– called Fellows – from Africa, Europe and the African Diaspora who are tasked to
develop deliverables and concrete initiatives and solutions to the challenges faced by
young people. The overall objective of the YPII is therefore "to provide a platform for
African and European Youth themselves to identify common deliverables to be brought
forward for State Leaders at the 5th AU-EU Summit and beyond." The fellows worked in
Addis and Brussels organized in six clusters focusing each on a priority theme in
accordance with the Joint Africa EU Strategy (JAES). Recommendations developed by
the YPII were submitted to 5th AU-EU Summit in Abidjan, Cote d’Ivoire.

311. Youth Employment: The Africa Economic Platform (AEP) brought together
African political and business leaders and academia to discuss issues affecting Africa
and how the continent can harness its vast resources. Among the key issues
deliberated on was African Skills Revolution – Empowering Youth for Employment,
Innovation and Entrepreneurship. The platform proposed fast-tracking the creation and
strengthening of centres of excellence with emphasis on skills acquisition across the
continent. It was also proposed to enhance harmonization of competencies across
national borders to promote labour and skills mobility.

312. There is a need for a tripartite summit on education – governments, the private
sector and academia – in order to address the disconnect between education systems
and labour markets, coupled with technological disruptions. Such a forum will also help
revamp education systems in the continent with emphasis on science, technology,
engineering and mathematics (STEM). It would also tailor technical and vocational
education and training (TVET) to the needs of Africa.

313. Pan African Youth Employability Conference: This Conference drew the
participation of about 120 youth from 47 African countries, as well as representatives of
governments, development partners and the private sector. It provided a space for
-----------------------Page 80 End-----------------------

                                                                        EX.CL/1061(XXXII)
                                                                                 Page 78

young people to explore opportunities for job creation, entrepreneurship and self-
reliance.

314. Skills Initiative for Africa: This is an initiative of the Commission with the
support of the German aid agency GIZ to strengthen occupational prospects for young
people in Africa. The centerpiece of the project is a financing facility for skills
development to be implemented by the NEPAD Agency. In addition to the financing
facility, GIZ is supporting the Commission and the NEPAD Agency to provide services
in the area of employment-oriented TVET and opportunities for knowledge exchange to
Member States. Cameroon, Kenya, Nigeria, South Africa and Tunisia have been
identified as the pilot countries. However, the project has not started because the pilot
countries are yet to confirm their participation.

315. Continental Dialogue on Education and Skills Development for
Employment: In partnership with the NEPAD Agency and the continental umbrella
organization for the private sector – Business Africa –, the Commission organized a
conference dubbed “Africa Talks Jobs.” More than 400 representatives of youth,
business, education practitioners and policy-makers from over 44 countries across the
African continent as well as European partners took part in the conference held at the
AU HQ in Addis Ababa. The highlight of the Conference was the commitment 120
African companies and business associations, under the auspices of Business Africa, to
invest in skills development and partner with education institutions for education and
skills development that will enhance employability prospects.

316. African Union Youth Volunteer Corps (AU-YVC): The African Union Youth
Volunteer Corps is a continental development program that recruits and deploys youth
volunteers in all Member States. The programme promotes volunteering as a way to
deepen the status of young people in Africa as key participants in the delivery of Africa's
human development targets and goals. It brings people together to share skills,
Knowledge and creativity. In 2017, the Departments of Social Affairs and Human
Resources, Science and Technology cooperated in the recruitment, training and
deployment of youth volunteers to assist Member States in strengthening their capacity
in health and disease prevention areas.

317. The Commission, working with the UN Volunteer Unit, conducted an evaluation
of the first phase of the AU youth volunteer corps. The outcome of this exercise will be
presented to the next STC on Youth, Culture and Sports in 2018. Linkages and new
partnerships were established with France Volunteer to promote volunteerism in Africa.
Finally, the Commission secured a grant of USD500,000 from the Ford Foundation in
2017 devoted to the activities of the youth volunteer corps.

318. The African Union Youth Volunteer Corps continues to grow in visibility and
strength. Financial ownership of the program by Member States is therefore needed to
reduce its current 100% dependence on partners. It is also important for the RECs to
increase their participation in the program, as this will expand and add value to the
involvement of the youth in the activities of the Union.

                                                                                 Page 79


GENDER EQUALITY AND WOMEN’S EMPOWERMENT

319. The priority activities that the Commission carried out during the reporting period
came from the decision of the Assembly on operationalizing Agenda 2063, the Goal 5 of
the Sustainable Development Goals 2030, the Strategic Plan 2014-2017 and the Theme
for 2017 “Harnessing the Demographic Dividend through Investments in the Youth”.
They aimed to advance the mainstreaming of gender instruments to ensure their
alignment with Agenda 2063 and the achievement of gender equality and women’s
empowerment.

320. Alignment of AU Gender Equality and Women’s Empowerment Strategy
with Agenda 2063 and Harmonization with national and regional policies: Agenda
2063 requires the establishment of institutional mechanisms to achieve the objective of
an integrated approach to gender equality and women’s empowerment. The
Commission, through the Women, Gender and Development Directorate (WGDD),
undertook the evaluation of the current gender policy adopted in 2009 and initiated in
line with Agenda 2063 a new gender equality and women’s empowerment strategy with
a stronger emphasis on tangible results, innovative practices and greater accountability.
Member States, RECs, Civil Society Organizations (CSOs), youth and development
partners took part in the formulation of these two initiatives to ensure buy-in and set the
path for harmonization with existing regional and national policies. The final strategy
and its operational plan together with a communications strategy will be validated by the
STC on Gender Equality and Women’s Empowerment in 2018.

321. The AU Gender Observatory: The Gender Observatory aims to increase the
capacity of Member States to generate knowledge to support policy formulation and
decision-making, monitor and foster greater compliance with commitments and enforce
accountability.

322. Although the full establishment of the Observatory is still delayed owing to
procurement requirements and resources constraints, the Commission was able to
secure necessary technical expertise to conceptualize and implement this important
assignment. As part of its efforts in generating knowledge on progress made by
Member States in implementing Gender Equality and Women’s Empowerment, the
Commission has produced the third edition of the African Union Gender Scorecard. This
document highlights the progress and success stories achieved by Member States on
gender equality with a particular reference to the AU 2017 Theme and its roadmap. A
joint effort between the Commission, UN-ECA, the African Development Bank and
UNFPA, the Gender Scorecard was presented during the 30th Assembly of Heads of
State and Government.

323. Alignment of the Fund for African Women with Agenda 2063: The Fund for
Africa Women was set up in 2011 to support the operationalization of the African
Women’s Decade. It is funded through the collection of 1% of Member States’ assessed
contributions and managed by a Steering Committee comprising representatives of
-----------------------Page 82 End-----------------------

                                                                         EX.CL/1061(XXXII)
                                                                                  Page 80

Member States experts and the Commission’s Women and Gender Development
Directorate. The current funding schedule is closely linked to the implementation of the
2010-2020 African Women’s Decade and its related themes.

324. In 2017, the Commission launched a call for proposals on the 2016 and 2017
themes on ‘Finance and Gender Budgets'' and “Mentoring Youth (Men and Women) to
be Champions of Gender Equality and Women’s Empowerment”, respectively. The
Steering Committee received over 200 proposals. In addition, the AUC commissioned a
situational analysis of the financing of the projects to better proceed with the granting of
2014-2015, 2016-2017 projects.

325. The Fund for Africa Women was also designed as a resource mobilization
vehicle for Agenda 2063 and its flagship projects, which raises the need to enhance the
resource mobilization capacity of the Fund to yield higher benefits for women’s
economic empowerment. In this regard, the Commission initiated an evaluation of the
Fund’s current operations and design new modalities to be implemented in 2018.

326. Strengthening of AU institutional learning capacity: The Commission’s
Women Gender and Development Directorate worked with the newly established AU
Ethics Office to improve an enabling work environment for women based on AU norms
and values. As a result, the Ethics Office was able to draft several key policies,
including the policy on sexual harassment, which will form part of the Gender Toolbox.
The Commission also set up an inter-departmental team to ensure that internal policies,
procedures, recruitment tools and performance management systems are gender
sensitive.

327. Enhancement of partnerships and advocacy: The Commission convened a
number of gender policy platforms between Member States, CSOs and other partners
whose objective was to review progress and propose the way forward in the
implementation of gender decisions. The Ninth Gender Pre-Summit and the Fourth High
Level Panel on Gender Equality and Women’s Empowerment brought together high-
level policy makers at national level and the youth to identify concrete actions needed to
implement the AU Roadmap on the Demographic Dividend, with a special focus on
young women. Some of the policy recommendations included the prioritization of
financial inclusion and women’s economic empowerment, the empowering of women to
break into male-dominated fields such as mining, and the strengthening of the Fund for
African Women to support women’s economic empowerment. These recommendations
will be submitted for the consideration of the Policy Organs at the January 2018 summit.

328. The participation in the 61st session of the United Nations Commission on Status
of Women (CSW61) provided an advocacy opportunity for the African common position
on gender equality and women’s empowerment to be included in global decision-
making platforms. Working with UN and development partners, the Commission
convened in January 2017, an Africa pre-CSW consultation meeting to consolidate the
African common position on the priority and review themes of CSW61 and to build
consensus on a coordinated African strategy to influence the Agreed Conclusions of
-----------------------Page 83 End-----------------------

                                                                     EX.CL/1061(XXXII)
                                                                              Page 81

CSW61. The Commission also launched the African Women Leaders' Network at UN
Headquarters in June 2017.

329. The Commission celebrated International Women’s Day (March 8) and Pan
African Women’s Day (July 31) to mark the continued struggle by women to achieve the
goals of gender equality and women’s empowerment, and raise awareness on key
issues related to women’s rights and violence against women. The African women’s
sculpture garden was also launched during International Women’s Day as a recognition
of African women’s contribution to the anti-colonial and anti-apartheid struggles. A
portrait of the founding mothers of the Pan-African Women’s Organisation (PAWO) was
also unveiled during the celebration of International Women Day. It is now displayed
alongside the portraits of the OAU founding fathers in the AU Conference Centre.

330. From 25 November to 10 December 2017, the Commission observed the 16
Days of Activism Against Gender-Based Violence Campaign to call for an end to
violence against women and girls as well as to advocate for the promotion and
protection of the rights of women and girls. The 2nd Specialized Technical Committee on
Gender Equality and Women’s Empowerment successfully convened from 4 to 8
December 2017, and adopted key decisions to promote gender equality and women’s
empowerment in Africa.

331. Knowledge Generation: During the period under review, the Commission
partnered with the UN on two important reports: one on the State of Women’s Rights in
Africa while the second was on Rapid Assessment on Funding Status of Gender
Machineries in African Union Member States. These reports were aimed at
strengthening advocacy for women’s rights and national gender machineries. The first
report was launched in the margins of the International Women’s Day. The second
report was scheduled to be presented to Ministers of Gender during the 2nd STC on
Gender Equality and Women’s Empowerment in December 2017.

332. Solemn Declaration on Gender Equality and Women’s Empowerment: The
Solemn Declaration on Gender Equality in Africa (SDGEA) reaffirms the AU's
commitment to gender parity at all levels, guarantees the right to girls' education and
women's literacy, as well as the full and effective participation and representation of
women in peace building processes.

333. This instrument is the AU's main reporting framework on gender issues. Reports
on the Solemn Declaration by the Chairperson of the Commission and Member States
are annually presented to the AU Summit by the Chairperson of the African Union.
During this reporting period, Member States submitted 28 reports, the highest number
since reporting on this instrument started in 2006. The reports are available on the AU
website.

334. Ratification and domestication of the Maputo Protocol: The Commission
organized in June 2017 a consultation meeting with Member States, the African
Commission on Human and People's Rights and Civil Society Organizations to plan for
-----------------------Page 84 End-----------------------

                                                                        EX.CL/1061(XXXII)
                                                                                 Page 82

the in-country advocacy missions on the ratification and domestication of the Maputo
Protocol. The participants produced a draft advocacy strategy on the Maputo Protocol
and identified Member States that have not ratified the Protocol for further assistance in
the ratification process. To date, 39 Member States have ratified the Maputo Protocol.

335. The contradictions existing between the Maputo Protocol and certain customary
laws and practices constitute a challenge to its full ratification and need to be resolved.
Several initiatives exist, such as the AU Gender Scorecard and the Gender Indexes
from the African Development Bank and UN-ECA, but there is still a need to improve
the collection of gender statistics at the national level and stimulate Member States’
reporting on gender instruments.

336. African Civil Society Organizations are key partners in delivering on the promises
of the African Union gender agenda. But many among them face significant funding
challenges that need to be addressed in order for them to effectively play their roles in
advocacy, monitoring, reporting and implementation of the AU gender agenda.

PAN-AFRICAN WOMEN’S ORGANIZATION (PAWO)

337. The Pan-African Women’s Organization (PAWO) was founded in Dar es Salaam
on 31 July 1962, one year before the founding of the Organization of African Unity
(OAU), by the first Conference of African Women. PAWO is Africa’s first and oldest
collective women’s organization established to “unite all African women’s organizations
into a single platform to share good practices, promote human rights with a goal of
eliminating any forms of discrimination against women, support Africa’s liberation and to
promote the full integration of African women in economic, social and political
development of the Continent”. PAWO sustained women’s struggle for their freedom
beyond the attainment of political independence.

338. During its 28th Ordinary Session in January 2017, the Assembly conferred to
PAWO the status of a specialized agency of the African Union (Decision Ex.Cl/Dec. 621
(XXVIII). The Women, Gender and Development Directorate (WGDD) is the lead entity
within the Commission to support the operationalization of PAWO into a specialised
agency. With the support of the Office of the Legal Counsel, the Directorate assisted
PAWO in drafting its new instruments which will cover, among other aspects, its legal
status, governance structure, finances and ratification procedures, among other issues.

339. In 2017, PAWO carried out advocacy activities with Member States. They
included the celebration of its 55th anniversary in Conakry in August 2017, as well as
the organization of a high-level event hosted by H.E. President Alpha Conde of the
Republic of Guinea and Chair of the Union. In 2018, the Commission will work with
PAWO to achieve its transformation into a Specialized Agency and help build its
capacities to operate in line with its new status.

                                                                                 Page 83

Social security and protection of vulnerable groups

340. The draft Protocol to the African Charter on Human and People’s Rights on the
Rights of Citizens to Social Security and Social Protection will be considered by the
Commission on Human and People’s Rights at it first session in 2018. Progress has
also been made with the drafting of the Social Agenda 2063.

341. Africa must step up its efforts to eradicate child labour on the continent. In 2012,
59 million children were working in Africa. In 2016, the numbers rose to 72 million. The
Plan of Action to End Child Labour (2018-2022) will be considered by the Policy Organs
in 2018. As requested by the Assembly, the Commission worked with UNECA, the
African Development Bank and ILO on the framework of the Employment and Social
Cohesion Fund. The draft will be submitted to the next session of the STC on Finance,
Monetary Affairs, Economic Planning and Integration.

MIGRATION

342. The 25th Ordinary Session of the Assembly issued a Declaration on Migration
(Assembly/AU/Decl.6 (XXV) which reaffirmed commitments to accelerate mobility and
integration on the continent while addressing regular and irregular migration. This
Declaration called for, among others, (i) speeding up the implementation of continent-
wide visa free regimes; (ii) expediting the operationalization of the African passport; and
(iii) strengthening efforts to combat human trafficking and smuggling of migrants. It
further requested the Commission to undertake the development of a Protocol on Free
Movement of Persons and, in collaboration with Member States, to acquire the capacity
to manage migration flows within the continent.

343. In recent years, Africa has witnessed changing patterns of migration, as this
phenomenon becomes both dynamic and complex. In recognition of the rapidly
changing migration trends and characteristics, as well as its nexus to development, the
Commission initiated an evaluation of the Migration Policy Framework for Africa
between October 2016 and February 2017, in order to determine the effectiveness and
relevancy of the policy in the current state of affairs. Member States meeting in Zanzibar
in November 2016 recommended that the Commission should review the policy
framework to take into account the current context of migration on the continent in line
with Agenda 2063 and the UN SDGs, and further develop a plan of action for its
implementation.

344. In implementing this recommendation, the Commission convened in April and
June 2017, respectively, a meeting of the AU Migration Working Group – comprising
Member States, the Commission and independent experts – to draft a revised migration
policy framework and draft a ten-year plan of action for its implementation. Member
States experts met at Victoria Falls in September 2017 to validate and consolidate the
revised drafts. They then submitted them to the STC on Migration, Refugees and IDPs
in Kigali in October 2017, where the policy and plan of action were eventually adopted.
-----------------------Page 86 End-----------------------

                                                                         EX.CL/1061(XXXII)
                                                                                  Page 84

345. The Commission, through the collaboration of the Departments of Political and
Social Affairs, prepared the Draft AU Protocol of the Free Movement of Persons in
Africa and its Implementation Roadmap, in line with Assembly’s decision,
Assembly/AU/Dec.607 (XXVII) of July 2016. This decision reiterated the Assembly’s
commitment to the acceleration of mobility and integration on the continent, and
requested the Commission to develop a Protocol on Free Movement by January 2018.
The draft Protocol was validated by the STC on Migration, Refugees and IDPs and
reviewed by the STC on Legal and Justice Matters. It will be submitted to the Assembly
for consideration at the January 2018 Summit.

346. The Common African Position (CAP) on the Global Compact on Migration (GCM)
was validated and consolidated by Member States experts in Victoria Falls in
September 2017. It was further reviewed by the STC on Migration, Refugees and IDPs
in Kigali, Rwanda, in October 2017. The CAP will act as a guide for Member States in
preparations for negotiations that have commenced already, as well as to adequately
guide and equip the Permanent Observer Missions of the AU in New York, Brussels and
Geneva. The negotiations at the UN level should conclude a framework for
comprehensive international cooperation on migrants and human mobility.

347. The Commission, in collaboration with IOM and UNHCR, launched a needs
assessment study of the AU Horn of Africa Initiative during a meeting held in Nairobi in
July 2016. The assessment explored the possibilities of cooperation among law
enforcement agencies around the Horn of Africa Initiative. It also explored ways to
sustain the efforts of law enforcement agencies operating along the three Horn of Africa
migratory routes – North, South and East – against human trafficking and the smuggling
of migrants. The findings of the needs assessment and resulting plan of action were
adopted at the second meeting of the AU Horn of Africa Initiative technical working
group on law enforcement held in Khartoum in May 2017. A progress report was
presented to the 2nd Ordinary Session of the STC on Migration, Refugees and IDPs that
convened in Kigali, Rwanda, in October 2017 for onward transmission to the Executive
Council at the January 2018 Summit.

348. The African Union needs to speak with one voice on migration issues. At the
moment, there are different processes and mechanisms on the continent that target
specific migratory routes. Varying interests and priorities of different stakeholders in the
migration area leads to duplication of efforts and interventions. Inadequate financial and
human resources to implement a common continental agenda on migration results in
overreliance on donor/partner funding.

349. There is also a need to fast-track the harmonization of the different processes
and initiatives on the continent (AU Horn of Africa Initiative, Khartoum Process and
Rabat Process). Adequate resources need to be dedicated to the development and
implementation of an African migration agenda aimed to maximize the development
benefits. It is necessary for the Commission to take charge of the continental mobility
and migration dialogue.
-----------------------Page 87 End-----------------------

                                                                      EX.CL/1061(XXXII)
                                                                               Page 85

350. Finally, enough human and financial resources should be allocated to the
Commission, both financial and human resources, to enable it undertake the migration
agenda in a more effective way so as to address the current migration challenges in the
continent.

Campaign to End Child Marriage in Africa

351. H.E. President Edgar Chagwa Lungu of the Republic of Zambia hosted a high-
level breakfast meeting on ending child marriage on the side-lines of the 28th Ordinary
Session. Subsequently, President Lungu presented the two-year report of the campaign
at the 29th Session of the Assembly. By its decision Assembly/AU/Dec.659(XXIX), the
Assembly requested President Lungu to keep matters on child marriage under active
consideration and to present an update during the 31st Assembly Ordinary Session.

352. So far, twenty-one (21) Member States have launched the campaign. 70% of the
21 Member States have launched their national AU Campaign to End Child Marriage.
Of those who have launched the campaign, 30% strengthened and enacted their laws
and mechanisms to protect the girl child.

353. The campaign to end child marriage witnessed notable progress across the
continent in 2017. However, not all activities could be implemented due to financial
constraints. Furthermore, feedback from national focal points posed a challenge to the
Commission’s ability to follow-up. Access to civil society organizations working on this
issue was also limited owing in part to lack of resources.

354. There is need to increase the budgetary allocation to the Campaign. National
governments also need to facilitate contact between the Campaign team and CSOs.
This also applies to the implementation of the Continental Plan of Action on the African
Decade of Persons with Disabilities (2010-2019) and the AU Plan of Action on Drug
Control which has been extended to 2019.

Disability

355. The Protocol to the African Charter on Human and People’s Rights (ACHPR) on
the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in Africa was adopted by the STC on Justice and
Legal Matters. It will be submitted for the consideration of the Executive Council in
January 2018. Capacity was developed for senior officials of Member States in North
Africa on the implementation of the Continental Plan of Action for the African Decade of
Persons with Disabilities (2010-2019). The finalization of the Protocol is a major
achievement for the Disabled People’s Organizations (DPOs) that have been involved
throughout the negotiations.

Older Persons

356. The Commission sent communications to all Member States during the January
and July Summits in 2017, requesting them to consider signing and ratifying the
-----------------------Page 88 End-----------------------

                                                                       EX.CL/1061(XXXII)
                                                                                Page 86

Protocol to the ACHPR on the Rights of Older Persons in Africa as soon as possible.
Member States are urged to all the necessary measure to advance the protection and
empowerment of Older Persons through priority programmes and projects.

Drug control and crime prevention

357. The Commission established the AU epidemiology network on drug use and
offered training to data collection focal points in ten (10) Member States. A continental
drug demand reduction consultation was conducted with all Member States in
November 2017.

358. The Drug Epidemiological Network is operational in ten (10) Member States in all
the five regions. Its presence helped in the collation of the first AU Epidemiological
Report on Drug Use. The report on the implementation of the AU Plan of Action on Drug
Control (2013-2017) was also adopted by the STC on Health, Population and Drug
Control in March 2017. The AU will host the first International Society of Substance Use
Professionals (ISSUP) workshop sometime in 2018.

Culture and Sports

359. Pursuant to decision EX.CL/974 (XXIX) on the establishment of the African Audio
Visual and Cinema Commission (AACC), the Commission convened in Nairobi, Kenya,
in September 2017, the Extraordinary Session of the Specialized Technical Committee
on Youth, Culture and Sport was organized to consider the Draft Statute of the AACC.
The Commission further engaged the Government of Algeria for the establishment of
the Great Museum of Africa as a flagship project of the Agenda 2063. The Technical
Committee on the Great Museum of Africa will meet in early 2018. The Commission
further organized the 3rd Meeting of the African Union Model Law on the Protection of
Cultural Property and Heritage to review the draft Model Law. Member States were
sensitized to ratify the Charter for African Cultural Renaissance which was adopted in
2006 but is yet to enter into force. To date, only twelve (12) Member States have ratified
the Charter for African Cultural Renaissance, while twenty-eight (28) have signed it.

360. The slow pace in the ratification of the Charter for African Cultural Renaissance
remains a major constraint for the implementation of culture programmes. The
ratification of the Charter will enable Member States to provide the needed attention to
the sector and ensure that their creative economy sector grows and increases its
contribution to the economy of the continent. The Commission therefore advocates for
the speedy ratification of the Charter by appointing an Arts, Culture and Heritage
Champion at the level of Heads of State and Government, who will sensitize Member
States on the urgent need to provide support to Algeria and the Commission on the
establishment and launching of the Great Museum of Africa, as well as to other culture
and arts continental programmes.

361. With respect to Sports, the Commission focussed its efforts in 2017 on capacity
building for women in sport administration, on strengthening strategies and programmes
-----------------------Page 89 End-----------------------

                                                                        EX.CL/1061(XXXII)
                                                                                 Page 87

to fight doping in sport and on including a Faculty of Sport in the Pan African University.
The Commission also contributed towards the strategies and programmes of Member
States to empower women in sport leadership and administration, and generally
towards human capacity development through inclusion of Sports Management and
Administration programmes in the Faculty of Sport in the Pan African University. The
mechanism and strategies to fight doping in Sport was strengthened at continental level.

362. The withdrawal of Equatorial Guinea as the host of the 2019 African Games has
affected preparations for the 2019 African Games. Willingness of Member States to
implement proposed strategies and programmes for sport for development remains a
challenge. Delays were encountered in the recruitment of regular staff of the AU Sports
Council, resulting in slow pace of operationalization of the AUSC and the AUSC
Regions with only one Region being fully operational. Delay in payment of arrears owed
by Member States to the Former Supreme Council for Sport in Africa (SCSA) impeded
AUC efforts to liquidate audited liabilities payable to former SCSA staff.

363. Member States are urged to conform and comply with anti-doping code
requirements and to implement anti-doping programmes. They should also continue to
promote the participation of girls, women and people with disabilities in sports and
effectively develop monitoring and evaluation tools to assess the implementation of the
previous decisions on a minimum quota of 20% of women and people with disabilities in
their Sport Management structure.

ACADEMY OF AFRICAN LANGUAGES (ACALAN)

364. In the course of 2017, the Academy of African Languages focuses its activities
on the development of corpus for Fulfulde, Wolof and Yoruba vehicular cross-border
languages in West Africa. It also translated in African languages a terminology for use in
the domains of health, human and people’s rights. The Academy advocated the use of
the harmonized orthographies of African languages, and completed the planning for the
linguistic atlas of the ECOWAS and SADC regions to be carried out in 2018. The
Academy expanded the Assembly of Academicians to make it more efficient, as
recommended by the Governing Board and Scientific and Technical Committee
meetings held in July 2015 and December 2016, respectively.

365. The continental dimension and strategic nature of the Academy’s mandate
requires an amendment of its Statutes to grant it financial and operational autonomy
and subsequently transform it into an AU organ or agency of the African Union. This
was the recommendation of the Academy’s statutory meetings. It is also recommended
that vacant positions, including that of the Executive Secretary, should be filled as soon
as possible.

                               OUTCOME 5:
              RESOURCE MOBILIZATION AND FINANCING THE UNION

366. Strategies for resource mobilization, including special emphasis on alternative
sources of funding, and/or additional funding sources to enable Africa to finance its
programmes and development.

OUTPUTS:

       •    Financially sustainable and viable Commission and Organs attained;

       •    Alternative sources of funding for Africa to finance its development identified
            and implemented.

Output 1: Financially sustainable and viable Commission and Organs attained

367. For decades, the continental organization has been grappling with the need for
self-reliance in funding its activities and programmes. This issue has gained renewed
drive with, among other initiatives, the adoption by the Policy Organs of decisions on
alternative sources of funding, the establishment of the African Institute for Remittances
and more recently, the mobilization of domestic resources for the financing of Agenda
2063 by Member States.

368. During the year under review, key issues that preoccupied the Commission
included (i) the domestication of Agenda 2063 and its First Ten Year Implementation
Plan, (ii) the evaluation of the AUC Strategic Plan 2014-2017, (iii) the implementation of
AU Reforms, and (iv) the development of the Medium Term Plan (MTP) 2018-2023.

DOMESTICATION OF AGENDA 2063

369. Progress was achieved in the domestication of Agenda 2063 during 2017. The
exercise is aimed at enabling Member States to begin the process of integrating the
goals, priorities and targets of Agenda 2063’s First Ten Year Implementation Plan into
their national development plans. The Commission conducted support missions in this
regard to forty (40) countries. Following the initial rounds of these technical visits, it is
expected that the forty Member States are now aligning their national development
plans to Agenda 2063 First Ten Year Implementation Plan. Working with the RECs, the
Commission has increased efforts to provide further Agenda 2063 domestication follow
up technical support to the forty Member States and to bring the remaining on board.

370. A progress report on the domestication of Agenda 2063 was presented to the
Ministerial Follow up Committee on Agenda 2063 at its meeting held in Namibia in
October 2017. The Ministers made several recommendations that will help to speed up
implementation.
-----------------------Page 91 End-----------------------

                                                                       EX.CL/1061(XXXII)
                                                                                Page 89


371. It is important to recall that the First Ten Year Implementation Plan (FTYIP) was
adopted by the Assembly in June 2015, exactly two years after the adoption of Agenda
2063. In other words, the domestication and implementation process only started in the
last two and half years. This means that the FTYIP will produce a lot of uncompleted
objectives that will have to be carried over into the Second Ten Year Implementation
Plan.

372. The Commission wishes to emphasize the need for Member States, the
Commission, the RECs and other AU Organs, including the NEPAD Planning and
Coordinating Agency (NPCA) and the African Peer Review Mechanism (APRM), to
accelerate the domestication, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of Agenda
2063 First Ten Year Implementation Plan in Member States. This can only be achieved
if they align their various development plans to Agenda 2063 FTYIP.

EVALUATION OF THE AU STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK 2014-2017

373. The evaluation of the 2014-2017 Strategic Framework was carried out in order to
identify challenges it encountered during its implementation and outline lessons for the
next Medium-Term Plan (MTP) 2018-2023. The evaluation highlighted the following
challenges: (i) a persistence of the ‘silo mentality’; (ii) difficulties for recommended
technical clusters to function adequately: (iii) the non-development of micro-plans at
cluster level; (iv) limited availability of resources, which led to the suspension or non-
implementation of most of the envisaged cluster projects; (v) limited implementation of
the results-based management; (vi) the lack of discipline in adhering to reporting
deadlines; and (vii) low but gradually increasing contribution of Member States to the
AU program budget, which resulted in heavy dependence on partnership funding.

374. The evaluation of the current strategic plan generated important lessons for the
MTP. Mechanisms for improved coordination and exploitation of synergies within and
among the Commission’s Departments, other AU Organs and RECs have been
developed. Capacity building programs focusing on both staff numbers and quality will
be implemented as well as implementation of the decision on financing the Union.

DOMESTIC RESOURCE MOBILIZATION STRATEGY

375. The draft domestic resource mobilization strategy for Agenda 2063 was
endorsed by the STC on Finance, Monetary Affairs, Economic Planning and Integration
in October 2017 and will be submitted for the consideration of the Policy Organs in
January 2018.

376. One of the options in the strategy is to develop a clear and robust roadmap with
value propositions to equip the Commission in engaging and partnering with the private
sector in the implementation of the Agenda 2063 programmes and projects.
-----------------------Page 92 End-----------------------

                                                                       EX.CL/1061(XXXII)
                                                                                Page 90

377. More domestic resources are needed for widespread roll out and domestication
of Agenda 2063. The technical and financial support provided by external partners,
including the UN system, to the SDGs gives them higher visibility at national level, thus
posing a challenge with respect to the domestication of Agenda 2063. Additionally,
Agenda 2063 and the SDGs may be perceived as parallel and competing frameworks at
the national level. This can become a serious challenge for Member States about what
to prioritize for implementation as they seek to domesticate Agenda 2063 and the
SDGs.

AGENDA 2063 MONITORING AND EVALUATION FRAMEWORK

378. In 2017, in collaboration with the RECs, as well as the NEPAD Agency, the
APRM, UN-ECA, the African Development Bank, the African Capacity Building
Foundation, the Pan-African Parliament and the Joint Secretariat Support Office, the
Commission drafted a common monitoring and evaluation framework for Agenda 2063,
a rigorous process initiated by the Commission since September 2015. The framework
integrates both Agenda 2063 and Agenda 2030 through a prioritized set of sixty-three
converging indicators. It implies that Member States will only produce a single report on
the implementation of both agendas. Activities related to the development of tools,
training materials and rolling out the M&E Framework to Member States, (through the
RECs) have since commenced.

379. The Agenda 2063 Monitoring and Evaluation Framework and its Indicator
Handbook were finalized and validated by planning experts from the Member States in
May 2017. The draft documents were tabled before the STC on Finance, Monetary
Affairs, Economic Planning and Integration in October 2017, which were recommended
for adoption by the Executive Council in January 2018.

MEDIUM-TERM PLAN (MTP) 2018-2023

380. The Commission began the process of developing its Medium-Term Plan.
Consultations with AU Organs and the RECs had taken place. A zero draft was
produced and discussed in-house. It will soon be presented to the Commission for
review and submitted to the Policy Organs for adoption in January 2018.

381. The Commission has finalized the development of its Medium-Term Plan 2018-
2023. The Plan heavily aligns itself to recommendations of the AU reforms as well as
Agenda 2063 First Ten Year Implementation Plan, but with inbuilt flexibility to
accommodate new decisions and declarations of the Assembly. The Medium-Term Plan
also refocuses the Commission on fewer high level and high impact strategic and policy
issues, leaving the responsibilities for implementation, monitoring and evaluation to
Member States, the RECs, and other AU Organs.

382. The key principles that will drive the execution of the Medium-Term Plan are
prioritization, accountability, transparency, harmonization (processes and systems),
flexibility/adaptation, coordination and control. Staff performance will be aligned to the
-----------------------Page 93 End-----------------------

                                                                        EX.CL/1061(XXXII)
                                                                                 Page 91

delivery of the Plan with concomitant reward and motivation competency-based system.
Implementation arrangements require that departments translate the imperatives of their
deliverables into work plans and budgets and execute their budgets at their own
initiative but in conformity with the approved results-based framework.

383. The evaluation of the 2014-2017 Strategic Plan generated important lessons for
the Medium-Term Plan 2018-2023. As a result, the new Plan includes mechanisms for
improved coordination and synergy within the Commission. Furthermore, the
Commission will take the necessary measures to ensure the operationalization of the
MTP Steering Committee and activate the functioning of the technical clusters. Efforts
will also be increased towards the full implementation of the decisions of the Policy
Organs on financing the Union.

384. An issue of concern for the Commission during the reporting period was that its
funds are currently housed under different Departments. The Commission initiated the
process to centralize their management and developed modalities to this effect. The
process is carried out in close collaboration with the Commission’s technical
Departments which are custodians of partners’ funds.

Output 2:    Financing of the Union

IMPLEMENTATION OF THE KIGALI DECISION ON 0.2% OF ELIGIBLE IMPORT
LEVY

385. As a very important element of the Union’s reform agenda, improving domestic
revenue mobilization with AU Member States is paramount to the success of the Union.
In order for Africa to realize its transformative development agenda, financial
independence that ensures better risk management, accountability and sustainability is
needed. Furthermore, sustainability is also needed in order to reduce over dependence
on development partners.

386. Following the bold decision taken by Heads of State and Government in Kigali in
June 2016 to finance the AU budget with locally generated resources, a number of
Member States have embarked on its implementation. As of November 2017, the
Commission has on record 15 Member States that are at different stages of
implementing the Decision, namely: Kenya, Rwanda, Chad, Djibouti, Guinea, Sudan,
Ethiopia, Ghana, Morocco, Cameroon, Congo Brazzaville, Cote d’Ivoire, Gambia, Sierra
Leone and Gabon. Other Member States such as Malawi, Seychelles, SADR and
Mauritius sought the support of the Commission to assist with understanding the
implication of implementing the Decision in light of global obligations they are affiliated
to.

387. A set of ‘golden rules’ establishing clear financial management and accountability
principles has been prepared by the Committee of Ten Finance Ministers (F10) by the
Assembly and will be tabled for endorsement at the January 2018 Summit, along with a
proposal for the oversight mechanism of the AU budgetary process.

                                                                                      EX.CL/1061(XXXII)

388. During the same period, the Commission also visited five (5) Member States to
follow up on the on the implementation of the Kigali Decision. The lessons learnt from
such visits assisted the Commission to mitigate challenges faced by some Member
States wishing to start implementing the Kigali Decision.

2017 AND 2018 BUDGET

389. In 2017, the proportion paid by Member States vs. partners to the budget showed
that progress towards greater financial self-reliance was being made and that the Union
was on track according to the AU Reform’s “Financing the Union” initiative. Indeed,
Member States’ contributions to the Programme budget have increased from 6% in
2016 to 15% in 2017, and are due to reach 37% in 2018. Member States have covered
100% of the operational budget. Member States contributed 45% of the Year 1 Target
for the Peace Fund in 2017.

390. While this trend is encouraging, there are areas of concern. By the end of 2017,
only 67% of the current year’s assessed contributions were paid by 39 Member States.
Actual contributions by Partners were on the increase, but most of these contributions
were made towards the end of 2017, which hampered implementation of AU plans
during the first semester. According to the financial situation at the end of December
2017, partners have contributed 85% of the AU programme budget (amounting to about
USD 247 million), and a significant amount of the AMISOM Budget.
391. To remedy this situation, the Commission will continue engaging Member States
in the context of the reform process and the reports to be discussed by the Policy
Organs, including the report of the Committee of Ten Ministers of Finance and the one
on the overall reform process. Furthermore, the Commission will hold a retreat with its
development partners to look into the causes of delayed payments and chart solutions
that will improve financial performance in 2018.

Figure 2: Actual contributions received from Member States and Partners

Member States:

During the period under review, payments and credits totalling US$220,336,699.13 had been received for
as total collection in 2017. Out of that amount, US$137,821,617.21 constitutes payment against the
current year’s assessment, representing 67% of the 2017 budget assessed to Member States. The
balance that is US$82,515,081.92 is composed as follow:

- US$ 45,621,602.50 constitutes the arrears collected from the previous year’s budget;

- US$ 29,530,655.97 constitutes collection for the Peace Fund. This amount is kept in a separate bank
account pending the establishment of the Peace Fund Governance structure

- US$ 7,362,820.44 constitutes payments and credits against the 2018 Budget as advance payment
received in 2017.




Partners:
During 2017, the African Union received a total amount of $567,043,210 in contributions from
international partners. This is broken down as follows, US$259,736,7284 for programmes and projects
and US$307,306,926 for AMISOM.


AU-EU STEERING COMMITTEE

393. On 24 May 2017, the Commission hosted the Third Steering Committee meeting
on the Aide-Memoire between the Africa Union and the European Commission on
Measures to Strengthen the Financial Management of the African Union Commission
(official signing of the revised Aide-Memoire). The AU requested this exercise as it will
help its management of Member States and Partner Funds. At this meeting, both parties
discussed the implementation rate of the agreed-upon roadmap towards Full Pillar

                                                                               Page 94

Assessment Compliance as part of the detailed Aide-Memoire Monitoring Action Plan.
In addition, discussions were held on EU’s support to Institutional and Administrative
Capacity Building activities and the Africa Peace Fund Projects, which include: MNJTF,
AU Human Rights and Military Observers in Burundi, C3IS, AMISOM. Status of APSA
III implementations, Joint Force G5 Sahel, and the RCI-LRA.

394. To ensure continued dialogue and timely implementation of the activities
underscored in the Aide-Memoire, focal points across the Commission, including the
Departments of PBFA, Strategic Planning and AHRM, held regular technical meetings
and preparations are underway for the second bi-annual Steering Committee meeting to
be held in January 2018.

COORDINATION MEETING OF AU ORGANS

There is an urgent need for the consistent application of the Financial and Management
rules across the different Organs and Agencies of the Union. The rules stipulate that all
Organs are expected to apply the AU administrative and financial rules and regulations
covering recruitment, finance procurement travel and medical coverage etc. However,
there appears to be some discrepancies in the interpretation of these rules.

395. Accordingly, Deputy Chairperson Kwesi Quartey, held a meeting of Heads of
Organs on standardized application of AU Financial and Administrative Rules and
Regulations in Addis Ababa in August 2017. The purpose was for the Heads of Organs
to discuss the Staff Regulations and Rules (SRR) and the AU Financial and
Administrative Rules and Regulations. Additionally, the meeting provided the Heads of
Organs and the staff from the relevant Departments the opportunity to discuss the
unique problems faced by the various AU Organs in applying the SRR. A follow-up
meeting at a technical level took place in November 2017 to discuss critical areas of
concern and the progress made on harmonizing a wide range of administrative and
financial matters across Organs.

396. There is a need to institutionalize regular meetings with all the Heads of Organs
and their administrative and financial managers to discuss both policy alignment issues
and financial and administrative challenges with a view to clarifying and resolving some
issues. There is also a need for AHRMD, PBFA, Legal Counsel, Medical and Health
Services and Internal Audit to work closely with the Executive Heads of Organs to
ensure strict compliance with the Administrative policies and the financial rules and
regulations.

397. Strengthen a people centered Union through active communication of AU
programmes, the branding of the AU, participation of Member States and other
stakeholders in defining and implementing the African agenda, respecting cultural and
linguistic diversity

OUTPUTS:

      •     Rebranding of the AU Commission, effective communication and increased
            visibility achieved;

      •     Stakeholder involvement in African agenda implemented, which reflects
            cultural and linguistic diversity, equal participation of women, youth and
            vulnerable groups improved.

Output 1: Rebranding of the AU Commission, effective communication and
          increased visibility achieved.

398. In 2017, in order to raise awareness and interest amongst African citizens on the
work of the African Union, the Commission carried out several activities through social
media, outreach programs and audio visuals. It focused mainly on promoting a positive
image of the African Union and of the continent by popularizing key projects and
achievements in line with the strategic priority of Agenda 2063.

399. A two-day workshop for African senior media professionals was held in Addis
Ababa in November 2017, to reflect on how they could translate their role as envisaged
in Agenda 2063 into concrete activities, and to exchange views on how to increase the
interest and engagement of common African citizens in the work of the African Union.

400. Currently, the AU Media Centre serves 64 journalists accredited to the AU and
more than 3,000 visiting journalists who cover events at the AU Headquarters, thus
ensuring that the activities of the AU are widely disseminated through national, regional
and international media houses. The Media Centre is equipped with 50 computers,
individual workspaces, facilities for live video and audio transmission of open sessions
of major meetings, audio recording in four AU working languages, cable and wireless
internet access, as well as access to the latest news, publications and media resources.

401. The Commission’s tradition of media briefings and press conferences also
continued. Over 50 media briefings were held during the year in review, 31 of which
were held during Summits. As of November 2017, a total of 383 press releases were
also issued and disseminated, including through social media platforms.

                                                                               Page 96

402. The AU Headquarters has become a major centre of attraction for a wide range
of visitors from all over the world. Over 600 people visited the AU Headquarters,
seeking to learn about the organization. Information and guided tours were organized
throughout the year in order to promote the corporate image of the Commission.

403. Numerous radio and television interviews were organized for AU senior officials
and resource persons who use the occasions to further elaborate on specific key issues
and projects and, thus, enhance public awareness of the work of the Union, and its
position on African and global issues.

404. The African Union’s online presence was also a major area of focus through the
development of various digital platforms to channel information to audiences across the
continent and beyond. Improvement of the AU website received greater attention in this
regard. Currently, information materials are posted in the four working languages of the
AU on the website: – English, French , Portuguese and Arabic – The AU website also
features audio-video content, publications and key policy documents, as well as AU
financial statements. The website counts more than 2.1 million hits and 1.5 million
unique page views have been recorded.

405. Social media also helped reach out to African citizens on the continent and in the
diaspora. As of November 2017, the AU counted about 320,000 followers on Facebook,
249,000 on Twitter, 1500 on YouTube and 1,516 subscribers on Flicker. The photo
archive increased by 72 percent.

406. Furthermore, the “Know Your AU” Campaign, which aims to popularize and
educate African citizens on the history, structures and functions of the Union, remained
on social media until the end of 2017. Its objective was to increase engagement with
African citizenry by directing online traffic to AU digital platforms.

407. Key messages from the African Union leadership during different events were
recorded and documented electronically and posted on AU digital platforms for wider
dissemination. Similarly, videos and animated creations of Agenda 2063 flagship
projects, the status of their implementation and their expected impact on the lives of
ordinary African citizens and the economies of African countries were produced.

408. Other products screened at all major AU events included 'From OAU to the AU,'
'Agenda 2063’ and 'Treaties of the AU'. Currently, documentaries on four flagship
projects are under production as part of the 'Know the AU Campaign'. They are on (i)
Formulation of a Commodities Strategy; (ii) Silencing the Guns by 2020; (iii)
Establishment of a Continental Free Trade Area; and (iv) Grand Inga Dam Project and
the integrated High Speed Train Network. There is also an on-going project to establish
a modern AU studio through the refurbishing and purchase of new audio-visual
equipment to increase production capacity and quality.

409. The AU ECHO newsletter is a platform for Member States and African citizens to
tell Africa’s story and comment on key programmes and initiatives by the Union. In
-----------------------Page 99 End-----------------------

                                                                      EX.CL/1061(XXXII)
                                                                               Page 97

2017, approximately 2000 hard copies were distributed at the Summits and other
different events, and electronic versions were posted on the AU website for a wider
reach.

410. The AU Handbook is published annually by the Commission in partnership with
the Government of New Zealand. It is intended to act as a reference guide on people
working in all parts of the AU system, as well as AU’s partners and wider civil society.
2500 copies were produced in 2017 and distributed during the Summits and at various
internal and external events. An Electronic copy of the AU Handbook was also available
on the AU website. Similarly, thousands of branded items, including calendars, were
distributed at various AU events, meetings and tours at the AUC Headquarters during
the course of the year.

Output 2: Stakeholder involvement in African agenda implemented, which
          reflects cultural and linguistic diversity, equal participation of women,
          youth and vulnerable groups improved

411. The Commission continued its efforts to create effective platforms and
mechanisms for the inclusive participation of the African diaspora and the African civil
society in AU activities. During the course of 2017, it invited the contribution of the
interfaith community in achieving peace, security and development in Africa. In
response, the Steering Committee of the Interfaith Dialogue Forum adopted a 10-year
Interfaith Development Agenda to be implemented by the interfaith community in all
Member States on Agenda 2063 and the UN SDGs 2030.

412. The Commission also convened the inter-continental Civil Society Organizations
Forum in the lead up to the 5th AU-EU Summit held in Abidjan, Cote d’Ivoire, in
November 2017. Civil society organizations from Africa and Europe issued a joint
declaration that calls upon institutions and leaders on both continents to act upon their
political commitments to facilitate and expand civil society participation in the AU-EU
partnership. The Forum also developed recommendations in the five thematic areas of
the AU-EU Summit that were submitted to the Summit for the consideration of member
states.

413. As part of the effort to build up a knowledge base on diaspora engagement and
provide Member States with policy tools, resources and information on this matter, the
Commission launched three projects to support diaspora policy and programme
development in Member States, namely (i) African Diaspora Engagement Toolkit; (ii)
African Diaspora Research and Mapping Study in Europe (UK, France, Germany,
Belgium, and the Netherlands); and (iii) African Diaspora Business and Professional
Network.

414. Furthermore, a legal and political framework for diaspora participation in the AU
was drafted. Once adopted by the AU Policy Organs, this framework will fulfil a key
outcome of the Global African Summit and will allow the Commission to transition from
-----------------------Page 100 End-----------------------

                                                                          EX.CL/1061(XXXII)
                                                                                   Page 98

the current ad-hoc method of diaspora representation to a standardized mechanism
across the AU system.

415. On its part, the AU Mission to the United States worked with key diaspora
organizations and individuals – women, faith-based and in academia _ in an effort to
build the African Diaspora constituency and promote African programs in the United
States. In 2017, the AU Mission launched a few diaspora projects within the framework
of Agenda 2063, such as the Grand Africa Tour from Cape Town to Cairo, which was
launched in Kigali, Rwanda, in August 2017 and the AU Diaspora Internet TV/Radio
Station. These were among the platforms initiated by the AU Mission to influence the
narrative on Africa in the United States and for the African Diplomatic Corps to engage
effectively with the Diaspora.

416. Following the Government of Zambia’s gracious donation to the Commission of
132 acres of land in Livingston (on the Zambian side of Victoria Falls), the AU Mission in
the United States engaged the African Diaspora in raising funds to develop five (5)
diaspora villages in the five (5) regions of Africa. Additionally, each village is expected to
comprise one tertiary care centre of a thousand-bed and state-of-the-art hospital, a
cardiac care center, and an ambulance service including emergency helicopters. A
pharmaceutical plant to address the issue of bad drugs is also planned. Each of the
villages will also have three (3) 5-star hotels to promote health tourism in Africa, with
banks, power plant, housing units for staff, real estate projects and infrastructure to
support the facility. This is a long-term project, with a current plan to raise USD10.00
per month per person.

AFRICAN INSTITUTE FOR REMITTANCES (AIR)

417. In 2017, the African Institute for Remittances (AIR) developed strategic
partnerships with African central banks through the Association of African Central Banks
(AACB), which accepted to be represented at the Governing Board and Consultative
Forum of the African Institute for Remittances. The draft Statute of the African Institute
for Remittances was endorsed by the Specialized Technical Committee (STC) on
Justice and Legal Affairs and will be considered by the Assembly in January 2018.
African central banks also reviewed the technical assistance programme of the African
Institute for Remittances, whose implementation began with seven (7) Member States,
namely the DRC, Ghana, Madagascar, Malawi, Mauritania, Nigeria and Zimbabwe.

ECOSOCC

418. The Commission facilitated the convening of the Second Ordinary Session of the
2nd Permanent General Assembly of ECOSOCC held in Cairo in March 2017. On the
agenda was the mid-term election of new leadership for the organ, as well as the
commencement of the reform of ECOSOCC and the relocation of its Secretariat to
Lusaka. These issues were given added impetus by the Decision of the Executive
Council taken during the July 2017 summit (EX.CL/Dec.975/XXXI).
-----------------------Page 101 End-----------------------

                                                                       EX.CL/1061(XXXII)
                                                                                Page 99

419. The General Assembly of ECOSOCC elected a new Bureau and members of its
Standing Committee; inaugurated new CSOs into the General Assembly; and adopted a
Strategic Plan of Action and constituted Working Groups to review the Statutes and
other framework documents as part of the ongoing ECOSOCC reform process. The
General Assembly also adopted its strategic action plan, which will help this Organ of
the Union effectively deliver on its advisory role.

420. Work has also been completed on the first phase of the implementation of the
Executive Council Decision on ECOSOCC reform. A multi-stakeholder consultation to
develop the framework for, and provide guiding input into the second and final phase of
implementation is currently scheduled for the first quarter of 2018.

421. ECOSOCC is also working with the Commission on the implementation of the
Assembly’s decision on the relocation of the ECOSOCC Secretariat. The current
Secretariat helped to coordinate the preparation of the financial, legal and structural
implications of the relocation in fulfilment of the directives of the Policy Organs. These
assessments, together with the detailed report of the evaluation mission to Zambia, as
well as related budgetary estimates, have been submitted for the consideration of the
Sub-Committees on Structure and Budgets.

                                                                                Page 100


                                 OUTCOME 7:
                  INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND REFORMS

422. Institutional capacities of the AU Commission improved, and relations with RECs,
AU Organs and with strategic and other partners strengthened

OUTPUTS:

      •     Institutional capacity of the AU Commission strengthened;

      •     Relationships with the RECs, AU Organs and strategic partners improved;

      •     Africa’s participation in multilateral affairs enhanced.

Output 1: Institutional capacities of the AU Commission strengthened

423. The Commission took steps to facilitate the implementation of the reform process
led by H.E. President Paul Kagame of Rwanda with the establishment of a Reform
Implementation Unit within the Bureau of the Chairperson. The Unit’s Head and Deputy
Head are already in post and have started their work, in the implementation of the
Decision Assembly/AU/Dec. 635 (XXVIII) of January 2017.

424. During the period under review, the Commission strived to implement the
decision of the Policy Organs to streamline the work of the Organization through the
ongoing reform process, mainstream gender and enhance relationships with the RECs.
The main purpose of the reform agenda is to increase the efficiency of the African Union
so that it can better deliver on its core missions, make an impact on the lives of its
people and contribute to world affairs.

425. The Commission made significant inroads in the following areas: human
resources management, administration and financial management, the upgrading of AU
policies and guidelines, enhancing staff learning and development, and modernizing
information technology and emergency response to cyber threats. In the years ahead,
the Commission will focus on the enforcement, implementation and regular update of
these policies and guidelines, taking into account the directives of the AU reform
exercise, as well as ongoing changes in Africa and the world at large.

426. During the reporting period, the Commission significantly improved its efforts on
governance and transparency. Nine policies were developed or implemented in this
regard, including on travel, promotion, advancement and upgrading, the security and
safety of the Union, ICT, Security, Plant, Property and Equipment Management. The AU
Code of Ethics, the AU Code of Conduct, the AU Anti-Harassment Policy and the AU
Procurement Manual were also part of these new policies. Additionally, as this report
was being finalized, ten (10) additional policies were in progress, out of which four (4)
were already endorsed by the Commission.
-----------------------Page 103 End-----------------------

                                                                       EX.CL/1061(XXXII)
                                                                               Page 101


427. Popularization of the approved policies among the AU staff also commenced with
the distribution of the procurement manual, code of ethics and anti-harassment policies.
However, there is need for the new policies to secure without further delay the approval
by the relevant organs of the Union to help with the standardization of all Union policies
and the attainment of efficiency in the work of the Organization. In this connection,
harmonized processes using automated processes to improve efficiency are also being
undertaken to improve timeliness, transparency and increased efficiency.

Youth Empowerment at the African Union

428. The Commission focused greater attention on collaboration and coordination with
AU Organs and Specialized Agencies, with higher emphasis on gender parity and
diversity, as well as the inclusion of youth in the activities of the Union.

429. A record 137 youth volunteers – 87 females and 50 males – were deployed to
serve across eleven (11) Member States in 2017. This was an increase by 46% over
the previous year. In addition, 44 volunteers completed their service at the AU at the
end of the reporting period.

430. Last July, the Commission launched the call for AU youth volunteers for 2018.
Over 37,000 applications from 52 Member States were received, for only a meagre total
of 100 positions to be filled. The 8th batch of training took place in Accra, Ghana, in
December 2017.

431. The Commission’s Departments of Social Affairs and Human Resources,
Science and Technology, collaborated with the African Union Youth Volunteer Corps to
train and deploy 35 young African professionals to the five Regional Collaborating
Centres of the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The training took
place in the nearby Ethiopian town of Debrezeit in November 2017. Thirty-five (35)
youth volunteers were subsequently dispatched to their respective duty stations to serve
for a period of 12 months. The Commission also instituted in-house training and peer-to-
peer staff exchange and leadership programmes with partners such as the EU, the UN
and the World Bank. More than 400 AU staff took part in these sessions in 2017.

Human Resources

432. The transformation of the African Union requires the development of staff skills
across the board. As the figures above suggest, youth volunteers and staff exchange
programmes are gaining visibility and interest. The Commission thanks those partners
who already participate in these programmes. In particular, the Commission is grateful
to Egypt for the support in sponsoring 50 staff members. The Commission urges all
Member States to contribute voluntarily to the funding and expansion of these
programmes as they promote the vision of the AU as people’s driven, especially through
the youth and women.
-----------------------Page 104 End-----------------------

                                                                          EX.CL/1061(XXXII)
                                                                                  Page 102

433. Efforts were also undertaken to upgrade the personnel’s remuneration and
benefits package so as to attract and retain the most qualified and talented Africans.
The revised package was submitted for the consideration of the Policy Organs during
the July 2017 Summit and, thanks to the Executive Council’s Decision –
EX.CL/Dec.967(XXXI) – the new package should be effective from 1 January 2018.

434. It calls for an increase of the AU basic salary by 6.1%, the creation of a new D2
salary scale, the revision of the monthly basic salaries of elected officials, of the housing
allowance rate for the various AU duty stations, of the education allowance rates, and
the installation allowance for internationally-recruited AU staff members. It also
introduces a conflict zone allowance and rent for official residence of the AU
Commissioners. Moreover, the Commission accelerated the creation of a new AU
pension scheme for effective implementation during 2018. The new pension scheme will
be more inclusive and would allow greater returns and benefits for the staff of the Union.

Information Technology

435. Finally, efforts were under way to upgrade processes, systems and infrastructure
required for a better work flow and the management of staff performance. The
Commission has established an IT Emergency Prevention, Preparedness and Recovery
Mechanisms to enhance the Organization’s response to information security threats and
breaches.

436. Two major cyber incidents occurred in 2017. One was the attack by a
ransomware of the IT and security system of the African Commission for Human and
People’s Rights, which resulted in a loss of data. The other was the crash of the
Commission’s firewalls – a protection system against external and internal security
threats – that left the IT infrastructure and systems vulnerable to cyber-attacks. This
incident had negatively impacted the connectivity with all AU offices outside the
Headquarters and significantly affected the quality of the Commission’s transactional
operations (financial management systems, procurement systems, human resources
systems).

437. The Commission wants to reassure Member States that it quickly took
emergency remedial measures and was successful in tackling these threats. Firewall
devices were thereafter installed in AU Offices in Washington DC, Brussels, Geneva, at
the African Commission for Human and People’s Rights (AfCHPR) in Arusha and IBAR
in Nairobi. In order to prevent another threat in the future, more sustainable actions
need to be implemented such as upgrading the Commission’s emergency response
system, creating a second Data Center and, more importantly, modernizing and
enhancing its cybersecurity infrastructures and capacity.

Compliance, Operational Efficiency and Service Delivery

438. Lastly, the Commission, with the financial support of the Japanese International
Cooperation Agency (JICA) and the Kaizen Institute, launched several initiatives to
-----------------------Page 105 End-----------------------

                                                                       EX.CL/1061(XXXII)
                                                                               Page 103

reduce waste and ensure greater operational efficiency within the Union. Activities
include all aspects of human resources management; procurement, travel and asset
management; guest tracking mechanisms in terms of security and safety services;
medical services delivery, and enhanced management of the Union’s financial assets, in
general.

439. With respect to the enhancement of medical services delivery, the Commission
completed Phases 1 and 2 of the renovation of the AU Clinic. The Clinic is now
equipped with ENT, dental, physiotherapy facilities, with improvement of the night duty
services. It will also save cost for the Commission as the number of referrals abroad will
decrease. Improvement of AU facilities will help save cost and even produce internally
generated revenues. For example, in 2017, the Commission collected around
USD300,000 in income from renting AU facilities.

440. The Organization has undergone various audits and assessments during the
year 2017, including KPMG audit reports on the state of play, external auditors report
for the year of 2016, as well as VII Pillar assessment conducted by Ernst and Young on
behalf of the EU. These audits flagged, among other things, the need to improve the
segregation of duties and the revision of the role matrix based on tasks, which is
underway.

441. The Commission also continued to implement the recommendations of the
2015/2016 Board of External Auditors. Currently, 43% of the recommendations were
fully implemented. Compliance with these audit recommendations contributed to
improving the compliance to existing rules and regulations, as well as developing
manuals and policies, as well as the hiring of competent compliance and quality control
officers. It also helped improve the control mechanisms of the internal audit.

442. The Office of Internal Audit (OIA) has made impact on the AU operations by
ensuring maintenance of adequate internal controls through the various audits carried
out and recommendations made for improvements, as well as capacity building of audit
staff and audit tools. The internal audit reports have also assisted in saving the amount
of time and cost incurred on audit of the AU financial statements through sharing of its
reports with external auditors.

Output 2: Relations with AU Organs, RECs, and Strategic Partners Strengthened

AU Relations with RECs, Organs and Specialized Agencies

443. During the reporting period, the Commission continued to enhance collaboration,
cooperation and exchange of information with other AU Organs and the RECs. Activities
included providing administrative support and servicing meetings of the Policy Organs,
negotiating host agreements in preparation of Summits and other meetings of the
Organs being hosted by Member States.
-----------------------Page 106 End-----------------------

                                                                         EX.CL/1061(XXXII)
                                                                                 Page 104

444. During the course of the year under review, the Commission held joint retreats
with the PRC, which helped improve the working relations between the two Organs and
their working methods.

445. As noted in this report, the Commission, AU Organs and Specialized Agencies
enhanced their collaboration with Member States in accordance with their respective
mandates. Host country agreements, however, remain one area that calls for greater
attention. It should be recalled that these agreements are more or less of the same
standards, and the obligations of host countries the same. However, some host
countries tend to require amendments that are often at variance with these general
standards. To avoid unnecessary misunderstandings, the Commission is preparing a
standard agreement to ensure the same requirements for all AU meetings held outside
the Headquarters. It will be submitted soon for the consideration of the Policy Organs.

446. As regards relations with the RECs, the Commission held several policy
harmonization and coordination meetings with the RECs, including at the highest level.
Following the decision of Policy Organs, the RECs are now participating in all the
meetings of the Policy Organs and contributing to their decision-making processes. The
proposal by the Assembly on AU reform – Assembly/AU/Dec. 635 (XXVIII) – to replace
the July Summit with a co-ordination meeting with the RECs with the participation of the
Chairpersons of the latter, the Commission and Regional Mechanisms is a substantial
step towards ensuring the harmonization of strategic plans and ensuring effective
coordination and mainstreaming of the RECs in the work of the African Union. It will also
help the RECs establish inter-linkages amongst themselves to build synergy and
address their overlapping mandates and multiple memberships.

447. On the other hand, it is imperative to agree on a clear division of labor and
effective collaboration between the Commission, the RECs, Regional Mechanisms, and
other continental institutions in line with the principle of subsidiarity. In the same vein,
as the Policy Organs are considering the AU reform proposals, they should be reminded
that many Member States RECS continue to hold membership in multiple RECs and
that the latter often carry overlapping mandates. This situation often results in
unnecessary duplication of work and wastage of resources.

448. Collaboration initiatives with the RECs were also undertaken by other AU
Organs. The African Capacity Building Foundation (ACBF) conducted several regional
training sessions, including (i) the development of a module on trade and finance in
collaboration with COMESA and Afreximbank; (ii) two regional projects with the Mano
River Union and ECCAS in partnership with the African Development Bank; (iii) the
finalization of one project document on combating illicit financial flows in partnership
with the UNECA and other partners. Other regional projects included capacity building
training program for fragile states, in partnership with the African Economic Research
Consortium (AERC).

449. At the initiative of the African Capacity Building Foundation for Africa, the 17th
International Economic forum on Africa jointly organized by African Union and the
-----------------------Page 107 End-----------------------

                                                                       EX.CL/1061(XXXII)
                                                                               Page 105

Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) recognized the
need to intensify investment in capacity development in Africa as a catalyst for the
continent’s transformation. Specific focus was put on capacity development for science,
technology and innovation, the theme of 2017 edition of ACBF’s Africa Capacity Report.
This flagship report was launched in Dakar, Senegal, in March 2017 on the theme
“Building Capacity in Science, Technology and Innovation for Africa’s Transformation.”
Its findings were based on data from 45 countries and eight (8) country case studies.
The Conference also highlighted the role of private sector in Africa’s structural
transformation. In this perspective, it emphasized the key role of entrepreneurship in
industrialization process in Africa.

450. Looking ahead, capacity building initiatives by the Commission and the African
Capacity Building Foundation will focus on resource mobilization and capacity
development for the successful implementation of the First Ten Years of Agenda 2063.
Priority activities will include the production of critical technical skills, including in
science, technology and innovation, and support to the capacity to re-engineer training
curricula to fit private sector needs. Strengthening governance and leadership capacity
and helping RECs improve their capacity to achieve regional integration agendas will
also be on the work plan, as well as enhancing women and youth capacity to engage
the private sector.

451. Furthermore, the Commission and the RECs recognize the need to strengthen
their cooperation with a view to accelerating the integration process in Africa.
Accordingly, the Commission envisages to involve strongly the RECs in the
domestication, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of the Agenda 2063. The
RECs hold a key role in the reporting process of the implementation of this Agenda.

452. There is also a need for the Commission and the RECs to speak with one voice
in their cooperation with various partners. In this dynamic, a common front should
therefore be built by rationalizing projects to be submitted to the partners for financial
support.

453. Joint Support Secretariat Office (JSSO): During the period under review, the
JSSO worked towards the following key expected outcomes:

      •     Effective co-ordination, collaboration and partnership amongst the three
            institutions of the AUC, UNECA and AFDB in order to ensure coherence,
            effectiveness and efficiency in development efforts;

      •     Strengthened joint implementation and monitoring of continental initiatives
            such as the Agenda 2063, 2030 and High-5 priorities;

      •     In this respect, JSSO organized the Joint Secretariat in January 2017 and
            the Steering Committee the meeting in March 2017, which served as an
            opportunity for dialogue amongst the top Executives and the Deputies of
            the three institutions, respectively;
-----------------------Page 108 End-----------------------

                                                                       EX.CL/1061(XXXII)
                                                                               Page 106



454. Furthermore, JSSO, through consultations and engagement with the Steering
Committee, Directors and technical experts of the three Joint Support Institutions,
formulated the terms of reference and operationalized three (3) thematic working
groups, namely communication, regional integration and Youth employment.

NEPAD PLANNING AND COORDINATION AGENCY (NPCA)

455. During the reporting period, the NEPAD Agency worked closely with the
Commission to accelerate the implementation of continental initiatives towards
economic integration and development. On their part, Member States and the RECs
continued to rely on the financial and technical assistance of the NEPAD Agency to
strengthen their capacity in critical development areas. Activities performed in 2017
focused on five critical programmatic areas, namely (i) skills revolution and enhanced
entrepreneurship; (ii) sustainability and resilience capacity; (iii) improved health and
nutrition; (iv) transformed agriculture and food systems; and (v) integrated corridor
infrastructure, trade and markets.

456. Skills revolution and enhanced entrepreneurship: The African Union High
Level Panel on Emerging Technologies, comprising the Commission, the NEPAD
Agency and ten (10) African leading experts selected in Accra in July 2017, the first ten
technologies for further research and up scaling. They include gene drives, micro-grids,
drones, precision agriculture, next-generation medicines, next-generation batteries,
water purification, synthetic biology, artificial intelligence and nano-technology. Out of
the ten, the panel recommended three for harnessing, namely: the application of gene
drives for eliminating malaria; the application of drone technology for agriculture and
food security; and the promotion of micro-grids for expanding Africa’s access to energy.

457. With respect to malaria eradication, trials have been successfully conducted in
laboratories using gene drive technologies to effectively alter anopheles mosquito
populations. They have successfully demonstrated the capacity of the technologies to
halt transmission of malaria parasites and to suppress and rapidly crash entire mosquito
populations in laboratories. The next step is to develop systems for testing the
effectiveness of such technologies outside the laboratory environment.

458. There is also increased knowledge of the factors that influence the emergence of
innovation strategies in Africa. A study jointly conducted by the United Nations
University (UNU-MERIT) and the NEPAD Agency provided remarkable insights on
innovations in Africa. The findings are captured in the report entitled, “Innovations in
Africa: Measurement, Policy and Global Issues”.

459. As noted elsewhere in this report, a major outcome in the enhancement of
entrepreneurship was the preparation of business incubators for women empowerment,
which will be tested in selected ECOWAS and COMESA member states with the
financial and technical assistance of the NEPAD Agency.
-----------------------Page 109 End-----------------------

                                                                       EX.CL/1061(XXXII)
                                                                               Page 107



Sustainability and resilience capacity:

460. Sustainable land and water management: The NEPAD Agency contributed
substantially to enhancing the capacity of the RECs towards sustainable governance
and management of natural resources. ECCAS and ECOWAS received technical and
financial support for tracking, monitoring, evaluating and reporting on the design,
planning and implementation of systems and practices related to sustainable land and
water management, as well as climate change and agriculture. In addition, the following
countries – the Comoros, the Republic of Congo, the Democratic Republic of the Congo
(DRC) and Malawi – received assistance in strengthening their country platforms for
sustainable land and water management (SLWM) investment planning.

461. The NEPAD Agency also increased its SLWM awareness campaigns in Burundi,
Côte d’Ivoire, DRC, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Lesotho, Liberia, Niger, Nigeria, Malawi,
Senegal, Swaziland, Togo and Uganda, while enhancing the technical capacities in
Malawi, Kenya and Uganda in the restoration of degraded landscapes. Other initiatives
included strengthening planning capacities for SLWM investments in Burundi, the DRC,
Ghana, Kenya, Niger, Nigeria and Uganda.

462. Green Climate Fund: The NEPAD Agency carried out a gap assessment based
on the fund’s fiduciary standards, environmental and social safeguards, and gender
policy as part of its initiative to facilitate countries to access Green Climate Fund. The
results of the assessment showed that while some moderate adjustments are required,
to enhance its application of environmental impact assessments, NEPAD’s fiduciary
function is strong. The fund was established by the UNFCCC to make a paradigm shift
towards low emission and climate resilient development pathways by providing financial
support to developing countries to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to the
impacts of climate change.

463. Improved health and nutrition: As part of the efforts to ensure the supply of
safe and effective medicines in Africa, the NEPAD Agency developed a draft treaty on
the establishment of the African Medicines Agency (AMA) for the consideration of the
Policy Organs in September 2017. This exercise followed a series of consultative
meetings with legal and medicines regulatory experts from thirty-three (33) Member
States.

464. At the regional level, some RECs were able to develop their own regulatory
frameworks for the supply and distribution of safe medicines. ECOWAS adopted such a
framework for its region and enhanced the attendant capacities for its enforcement. In
collaboration with the West African Health Organization and the West African Economic
and Monetary Union, ECOWAS also initiated the harmonization of medicine regulations
across all its fifteen (15) member states.

465. A framework for tracking, monitoring and reporting the manufacture, import,
export and distribution of medicines was also endorsed by Member States in September
-----------------------Page 110 End-----------------------

                                                                        EX.CL/1061(XXXII)
                                                                                Page 108

2017. The framework, which promotes the circulation of safe medicines on the African
market, was piloted in the five Member States of the East African Community (EAC),
and will be rolled-out to other RECs soon.

466. The NEPAD Agency also contributed to the enhancement of Africa’s capacities in
research and development for collaborative work by providing assistance to eleven (11)
Regulatory Centers of Research Excellence (RCOREs) in various disciplines related to
health and nutrition in East, South and West Africa.

Transformed agriculture and food systems:

467. Agriculture and food insecurity risk management: The NEPAD-ARCH (Africa
Resilience Coordination Hub), which is the implementation vehicle for risk management
in agriculture and food insecurity, was established through a partnership with the World
Food Programme (WFP) and Periperi University, a partnership of twelve (12) African
universities. The ARCH aims to support national and local governments in converging
complementary measures related to agriculture risk management for effective
implementation at community level. The first implementation phase will cover Uganda,
Tanzania and selected Sahel countries.

468. Grow Africa, on its part, launched platforms to promote specific agriculture value
chains in various countries, including Burkina Faso, Côte d’Ivoire, Ghana, Kenya,
Malawi, Mozambique, Nigeria and Rwanda. Ten countries - Senegal, Burkina Faso,
Mozambique, Madagascar, Nigeria, Ethiopia, Malawi, Ghana, Sudan and Kenya – were
selected as the first-wave cohort that will implement the Initiative for Food and Nutrition
Security in Africa (IFNA). The initiative is geared towards better coordination of food and
nutrition interventions and support to priority areas defined at national level. The IFNA
secretariat is housed at the NEPAD Agency.

469. The NEPAD Agency finalized a blueprint to implement rural development policies
in Africa, whose implementation will commence in 2018. The ‘Rural Development
Blueprint Operational and Implementation Strategy and Plan for Africa’ consists of a set
of ‘country self-assessment and implementation’ tool. Each Member State will be
supported in crafting and/or strengthening their rural transformation agenda using such
tools. The vision is of “people-centred rural transformation based on equity and
inclusiveness, where rural men and women can develop their potential and reach their
aspirations”.

470. Food and environmental safety: The African Biosafety Network of Expertise
(ABNE) hub continued to provide technical support on food safety, environmental
safety, and salient socio-economic, legal, and communication matters pertaining to
biosafety at the country- and regional-levels, particularly in promoting standards in food
production and consumption.

471. National agriculture investment plans: The formulation of national agriculture
and food security investment plans (NAFSIPs) – as recommended by the Malabo
-----------------------Page 111 End-----------------------

                                                                      EX.CL/1061(XXXII)
                                                                              Page 109

Declaration Implementation Strategy and Roadmap – was among the main
achievements recorded at the regional level in 2017. ECOWAS Member States were
able to develop their new generation of NAFSIPs. Similarly, Burundi, Rwanda, Tanzania
and Uganda launched theirs, while Malawi and Mozambique completed the
development process. Ghana, Kenya, Malawi, Benin, Burkina Faso, Togo, Ethiopia and
Rwanda received additional training and education to improve their agriculture skills.

472. The new generation of NAFSIPs places countries in a stronger position for more
effective implementation, peer-learning, resource mobilisation, and overall management
of agriculture transformation. The focus is also to ensure improved support to youth
and women – specifically to meet the target of 30% preferential entry for youth and
women in viable agribusiness along prioritized value chains.

473. In an effort to mobilize investments aligned to the national agriculture investment
plans, Grow Africa partnered with several private sector groups such as the Nigeria
Agribusiness Group, the Ethiopia Private Sector Development Task Force, and the
Ghana Private Enterprise Federation.

Integrated corridor infrastructure, trade and markets

474. PIDA Implementation: In line with the campaign for the allocation by Member
States of 5% of assets under management to infrastructure development, the NEPAD
Agency made the necessary technical preparations to fast-track various regions through
the implementation of selected Programme for Infrastructure Development in Africa
(PIDA) projects. These projects include Batoka Gorge, the Zambia-Tanzania-Kenya
(ZTK), Beira Bridge to Harare Road Toll under the North-South Corridor, and Ruzizi 3.

475. Resource mobilization commenced for the implementation of five (5) PIDA
Priority Action Plan (PAP) projects, namely: Batoka Gorge Hydropower, ZTK, Beira
Bridge to Harare toll road under the North-South Corridor, Ruzizi 3 and Congo
(Brazzaville and Kinshasa) Bridge, following the completion of the technical project
preparation for bancability and packaging. Subsequently, the five projects were
marketed among public and private investors at different fora, including the PIDA Week.

476. The PIDA Week, held in Namibia in December 2017 under the theme “Enhancing
Trade and Economic Transformation through Regional Infrastructure Development”,
discussed the following six (6) projects in depth: the Central Corridor (Dar es Salaam to
Chalinze Toll Road), Kinshasa-Brazzaville Rail and Road Bridge, Abidjan-Lagos
Multimodal Corridor, Zambia-Tanzania-Kenya Power Interconnector, Batoka Gorge
Hydropower Project, and Inga III Dam. In January 2017, the Technical Task Team had
unanimously endorsed the Namibian Presidential Infrastructure Champion Initiative
(PICI) project. The PICI was subsequently endorsed by the Ministerial Working Group
and approved by the Chair of the PICI.

477. In May 2017, Benin, Ivory Coast, Ghana, Nigeria and Togo reached a consensus
on defining a common institutional and legal instrument for the Abidjan-Lagos
-----------------------Page 112 End-----------------------

                                                                         EX.CL/1061(XXXII)
                                                                                 Page 110

Multimodal Corridor. The instrument, dubbed the Abidjan-Lagos Corridor Management
Authority (Alcoma), will oversee the implementation and management of the Abidjan-
Lagos Corridor. Advocacy and visual and written communication materials on the
corridor are available in order to mobilize technical and political support for the project.

478. Cross-border harmonization: The NEPAD Agency pursued its cross-border
harmonization efforts to enable viable project operations across countries. The efforts
focused essentially on aligning regulatory, legal, procurement, and institutional
frameworks using the Service Delivery Mechanism (SDM). The SDM is an instrument
created out of Dakar Financing Summit (2015) to fast-track for early stage infrastructure
project preparation and development.

479. The establishment of a One Stop Border Post (OSBP) network and traffic light
system (TLS) was a positive step, as it will enhance the mobility of goods and people
across borders through simplified and integrated logistical operations. The NEPAD
Agency also developed principles and guidelines for the operationalization of the One
Stop Border Post and organized domestication sessions for SADC and COMESA
Member States. Working sessions with the EAC, COMESA and IGAD countries
produced action plans for prioritization at the national level. On its part, SADC adopted
a traffic light system with the aim to address the challenges faced on the North-South
Corridor and the Beira Development Corridor. The NEPAD Agency also developed a
TLS tool using turnaround time as a key performance indicator of corridor
attractiveness. The TLS tool will be deployed in 2018, initially in the following six areas:
Beit Bridge, Martins Drift, Kasumbalesa, Nakonde, Chirundu and Kazungula.

480. Regional infrastructure projects: The year under review also witnessed an
acceleration in the implementation of the projects in the Central Corridor, the Beira
Development Corridor, the North-South Corridor and the Dakar-Abidjan-Lagos
Multimodal Corridor. The NEPAD Agency contributed to these advances with technical
expertise and training to fill capacity gaps at the national and regional levels. Forty (40)
infrastructure experts from the RECs and national project implementation teams
benefitted from this assistance.

481. The NEPAD Agency and SADC signed memoranda of understanding, enabling
the establishment of corridor management institutions for the North-South Corridor and
the Beira Development Corridor, respectively. In IGAD, preparations were well-
advanced to undertake GIS mapping of key regional infrastructure and corridors. A set
of projects was compiled under the Priority Project Pipeline for the Djibouti Corridor.
COMESA developed a strategic plan for the corridor, which is awaiting the approval of
its member states. The Arab Maghreb Union (UMA) received technical support to
update the status of the aquifer system of Lullemeden and Taoudent/Tazrouft.

482. By the end of 2017, technical studies were underway to complement the
Lilongwe-Lusaka fiber cable and other fiber links throughout the SADC-EAC-COMESA
regions. A feasibility study and detailed engineering designs for the Central Corridor
Transit Transport Facilitation Agency (CCTTFA) Uvira-Kamanyola-Bukavu road were in

                                                                      EX.CL/1061(XXXII)
                                                                              Page 111

their final stage. The feasibility study of the Zambia, Tanzania and Kenya (ZTK) Power
Transmission project was also in its final drafting stage. A gender guide for
infrastructure projects has introduced important gender considerations in the ZTK
feasibility study and the Abidjan-Lagos Corridor.

483. Forward Planning: Growing expectations placed on the NEPAD Agency as the
AU Development Agency (AUDA) require an augmentation of its material, human and
financial resources. At the national level, Member States at the highest level are urged
to sustain and reinforce their financial and political support to the NEPAD Agency in
order to facilitate the delivery of its mandate. At the regional level, the NEPAD Agency
will continue to work with the Commission to strengthen the synergies already existing
with the RECs within the global context of NEPAD’s mandate. In 2018, the Commission
will enhance the synergy with the NEPAD Agency so as to accelerate the realization of
the continental development ambitions as decided by the Policy Organs.

ACCREDITATION TO THE AFRICAN UNION

484. The Commission continued to enhance the relationship between the
Organization and non-African States and other organizations with due regard to the
interests of the Union. In accordance with Part II, Section II (3) of the Criteria for
Granting Observer Status and for a system of Accreditation within the African Union (the
Criteria), adopted by the Executive Council in July 2005, the Commission has continued
to receive and consider requests for accreditation from various non-African States and
Organisations.

485. To date, the total number of non-African States and international organizations
accredited to the African Union is now one hundred and ten (110) i.e. eighty-nine (89)
non-African States and twenty-one (21) Regional Integration and International
Organizations.

MULTILATERALISM AND STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIPS

486. The year 2017 witnessed greater dynamism and focus in the AU relationship with
its partners. At the same time, the Commission continued its efforts to enhance the
effectiveness and scope of its engagement with its partners and, more importantly, align
such engagements with Africa’s strategic development goals as contained in the African
Union Agenda 2063 and its First Ten Year Implementation Plan. The AU Reform has
guided the entire process.

487. During the period under review, the Commission promoted closer collaboration
with AU Strategic Partners and maintained seamless continuity in advancing the
process of implementing the agreed areas of cooperation. However, more efforts are
expected towards improving the process of engaging and sustaining Africa’s Strategic
Partnerships with a view to achieving the continental development and integration
agenda.

488. By its Decision EX.CL/Dec.942 (XXX) of January 2017, the Executive Council
directed the PRC, in collaboration with the Commission and the RECs, to hold special
sessions within six months to allow for an in-depth discussion and analysis of all
aspects of strategic partnership in order to formulate appropriate proposals and
recommendations. The Executive Council also mandated the Commission, in
collaboration with the PRC, to undertake an in-depth evaluation of all partnerships and
submit concrete recommendations in July 2018. In accordance with the above-
mentioned Decision, the PRC and the AUC decided to convene a joint retreat in Cairo
from 13 to 14 December 2017, to consider the report of the PRC Subcommittee on
Multilateral Cooperation on the evaluation of Africa’s strategic partnerships and to make
recommendations to the January 2018 Summit, in line with the AU Reform agenda.
-----------------------Page 115 End-----------------------

                                                                      EX.CL/1061(XXXII)
                                                                              Page 113

These recommendations defined an AU strategy for the establishment, management
and coordination of strategic partnerships.

489. Several concrete steps were taken for strengthening the institutional capacity of
the Commission to implement the new strategy, and to reform the AU governance of
partnerships. Formal procedures were put in place, compelling the AU, RECs and
NEPAD to work together on management of AU strategic partnerships. A recipe was
drawn up for strengthening the AUC’s ability to analyze and negotiate cooperation
scopes with partners on behalf of Africa, while fostering coherence with other related
functions of resource mobilization and diaspora relations.

490. During the period under review, the Commission (co-)organized the following
summits and meetings listed below.

491. Africa Union-China Cooperation: The Minister of Foreign Affairs of China, Mr.
Wang Yi, visited the African Union Commission on 21 June 2017. He held a bilateral
high-level dialogue with the Chairperson of the Commission. The two Principals
highlighted the complementarity between the development agendas of Africa and
China. They discussed bilateral cooperation between the African Union and the
Government of China, based on five pillars, namely consolidating gains made under the
outcome of FOCAC Johannesburg Summit of 2015; peace and security cooperation,
cooperation in public health to support Africa in strengthening disease control and
prevention system; human resource development in the AU and Africa, and intensifying
coordination in international and regional affairs.

492. The two Principals then inaugurated the Africa-China Think Tank Forum entitled
“Fighting against Poverty for Common Prosperity.” The Forum focused on the way
poverty has been addressed in China and in Africa. It drew lessons from the two
decades of poverty alleviation experience of government and civil society organisations.
Particular focus was placed on rural poverty and the type of policies and programs that
have made the most impact.

493. The Chairperson of the Commission will visit Beijing in the first quarter of 2018 to
discuss means of increasing Chinese investments on the Continent, promoting two-way
tourism, and enhancing cooperation in peace, security and on the international issues of
mutual concern.

494. Tokyo International Conference of African Development (TICAD): the
Commission co-organized with Japan, the United Nations Office of the Special Adviser
on Africa, the United Nations Development Programme and the World Bank, the TICAD
VI Ministerial Follow up Meeting in Maputo, Mozambique, in August 2017. The meeting
reviewed progress made in implementing the TICAD V Plan of Action adopted in
Yokohama, Japan, in 2013, and the implementation plan of TICAD VI, adopted in
Nairobi in 2016. The TICAD VI Follow-up Ministerial Meeting also identified actions
aimed at facilitating preparations for the upcoming TICAD VII Summit planned in Japan
in 2019.
-----------------------Page 116 End-----------------------

                                                                     EX.CL/1061(XXXII)
                                                                             Page 114


495. Although the Ministerial Meeting was held as planned, objections over the full
participation of all Member States to the meeting led to the cancellation of the Senior
Officials Meeting (SOM) that should have preceded the Ministerial Meeting. After
intensive negotiations to overcome the deadlock, all AU Member States were finally
able to participate under some restrictions.

496. AU-Germany Annual Consultations: In September 2017, the Bureau of the
Deputy Chairperson (BDCP), in collaboration with the various technical Departments
and Organs across the Union, provided coordination during the Annual High Level
Negotiations on Development Cooperation between the African Union and the
Government of the Federal Republic of Germany.

497. Africa –Korea: following the 4th Africa – Korea Forum held in Addis Ababa in
December 2016, the two sides met in Seoul in September 2017 during the first Policy
Consultation meeting as directed by the Ministerial Forum. The Policy Consultation
meeting discussed concrete projects and programs that both sides agreed to implement
during the coming two to three years.

498. AU Commission-US High Level Dialogue: the 5th Annual AUC-US High Level
Dialogue was held in Washington, DC, in November 2017, followed by a bilateral
meeting between the Chairperson of the Commission and the U.S Secretary of State.
The meetings were organized by the AU Permanent Mission to Washington, D.C., the
Partnership Management and Coordination Division, together with the U.S. Department
of State. The two partners took stock of progress made in the four areas of dialogue
and cooperation, namely peace and security; democracy and governance;
opportunity and development; and economic growth, trade and investment.

499. On peace and security, the partners agreed to the importance of an orderly
well-supported transition in Somalia, further support to the G5 Sahel on
counterterrorism and development, and agreed on the need for broader dialogue
and cooperation between the AU and US on cases such as South Sudan, and more
generally areas of conflict prevention, DDR, reconciliation and reintegration; non-
proliferation; and counterterrorism.
500. On opportunity and development, the partners pledged to continue cooperation
on empowering women in peace and security; and opening up opportunities for young
people, in addition to maintaining dialogue and cooperation on migration.

501. On democracy and governance, the two partners discussed the African
Governance Architecture, human rights, elections, rule of law, and agreed to continue
cooperation in those areas.

502. On economic growth, trade and investment, the partners reflected on the AGOA
Forum held in Lomé, Togo, in August 2017, and its preparatory mid-term review, The
U.S. reconfirmed their commitment to AGOA in the ten-year reauthorization period.
Cooperation on CAADP was an agreed priority, particularly on helping African

                                                                                Page 115

agriculture to withstand shocks and disasters through technology and biotechnology.
The importance of cooperating on cybersecurity was an agreed priority.

503. The Chairperson of the Commission held meetings with other stakeholders,
organized by the AU Permanent Mission to Washington D.C., including members of the
bipartisan Congressional Black Caucus, who reconfirmed their support to the AU and its
programmes and priorities. His meeting with the African Group of Ambassadors
provided an opportunity to outline the priorities of the new Commission in light of the
First Ten Year Plan of Agenda 2063 and the AU Reform.

504. USAID Project Coordination: The Bureau of the Deputy Chairperson continued
to work closely with the Departments of Programming, Budget, Finance and Accounting
(PBFA) and the Resource Mobilization Division to ensure continuous timely
implementation of USAID-funded activities in the Women and Gender Directorate,
Department of Social Affairs, Youth Division, Division of Health, Nutrition and
Population. Data and information received from regular consultations were used to
develop quarterly progress reports on the USAID Assistance Agreement. Funding
obligated through the USAID Assistance Agreement increased to USD 12.16 million to
date. As part of the 2018 budget preparation process, consultative meetings were held
with USAID, and technical and financial support was secured for capacity building,
youth and CARMMA activities across the Commission.

505. African Union-European Union: the 5th African Union – European Union (EU)
Summit was held in Abidjan from 29 to 30 November 2017. The Summit was placed
under the theme “Investing in Youth for accelerated inclusive growth and sustainable
development”.

506. The AU and EU sides reiterated their determination to give a new impetus to their
partnership through the establishment of effective and inclusive joint mechanisms and
structures, which include annual Joint Ministerial meetings. The Summit also requested
the two Commissions to develop an action plan, within three months of adoption of the
5th AU-EU Summit Declaration, to detail joint projects and programs within the AU-EU
Joint Priority areas of cooperation that both sides agree to implement, and to establish a
joint follow-up mechanism. An ambitious first draft of the priority projects was
developed within two weeks of the Summit, which detailed cooperation on a number of
Agenda 2063 flagship projects, particularly education and skills development; silencing
the guns; governance, domestic resource mobilization, fight against corruption and illicit
financial flows; building climate resilience; managing mobility and migration; investing in
PIDA, CAADP and AIDA; supporting the Continental Free Trade Area (CFTA); and fast
tracking the AU 2050 Integrated Maritime strategy (AIMS2050).

507. Post-Cotonou: The next major milestone in the African Union – European Union
partnership will be the end of the Cotonou Partnership Agreement (CPA) between the
EU and 78 African, Caribbean and Pacific countries (ACP) on 29 February 2020. That
agreement is a legally binding treaty that covers trade, development cooperation and a
political dimension. Since 2007, the Joint Africa Europe Strategy (JAES) has
-----------------------Page 118 End-----------------------

                                                                          EX.CL/1061(XXXII)
                                                                                  Page 116

complemented the CPA in scope. The EU foresees that a post-Cotonou agreement
would replace both instruments (CPA and JAES).

508. Debates in both Africa and Europe have questioned whether a Post-Cotonou
agreement is needed, but opinions are converging towards the importance of having
one that reflects current issues facing both continents and progress made since the last
revision of CPA in 2010.

509. The African Union has been tasked with facilitating a common African position,
which is currently in progress based on a paper prepared by the African Group in
Brussels. The CAP will be built on the premise of a partnership between two
independent and sovereign blocs, who commit to upholding their values and respective
regulations and instruments, and who seek to maximize their interests, thereby moving
away from a paternalistic or donor-recipient relationship.

510. Since the CPA was signed, Africa has been through considerable progress. The
African continent has demonstrated higher economic growth rates than world average.
The continent has also built its own institutions, where the African Union was
operationalized as a successor to the Organization of African Unity, just after the
signing of the CPA, and has been growing since then as the Continental organization in
charge of facilitating regional integration and continental development.               It has
increasingly supported Africa in coordinating its strategic partnerships with the rest of
the world, and enabled its global voice to be heard. The AU expects to see any new
agreement to fully trust and invest in African institutions, as this is critical for the next
phase of Africa’s development.


511. The AU has made it clear in public statements, as well as in the declaration of
the 5th AU-EU Summit, that Africa should be treated as a whole continent in its
cooperation with Europe, and not divided. At the same time, the Commission
recognizes that more work and effort is required to appropriately incorporate sub-
regions that were not originally part of the CPA, and to do away with the lack of clarity
surrounding their involvement under a post-Cotonou agreement.

512. The AU also emphasized the importance of maintaining Africa’s independence in
its relationship with Europe, and not being bound to other regions of the world. The AU
will insist on the importance of not subjecting Africa to any external influence in
expressing its position vis-à-vis world politics or in managing its own affairs.

513. The African Union insisted that any cooperation instrument with Europe should
promote African objectives in the form of Agenda 2063, which was largely harmonized
with the UN Agenda 2030. In connection with continental integration objectives, any
free trade arrangement is expected to complement and strengthen the Continental Free
Trade Area.
-----------------------Page 119 End-----------------------

                                                                       EX.CL/1061(XXXII)
                                                                               Page 117

514. Finally, the African Union highlighted the importance of building on gains made at
the AU-EU Summit and not building a parallel process that would dilute the political
commitment invested by leaders of both continents. The legal and institutional
framework for a post-Cotonou agreement would be part of the negotiations.

515. Procedurally, the EU High Representative/Vice-President published a
communication supporting an umbrella agreement defining common values and
interests, with distinct tailor-made partnerships with ACP regions. Subsequently, the
EU Foreign Council will discuss negotiation modalities in January 2018, after which they
will seek to open negotiations with the African Union on behalf of the Continent with
regards to modalities. In the meantime, the African Union will be preparing its position
in order to be ready to engage in substantive negotiations of the agreement starting July
2018, subject to Member States readiness and approval.

516. Africa–Arab: In December, a General Cooperation Meeting was held at the
Headquarters of the League of Arab States in Cairo between the Chairperson of the
African Union Commission and the Secretary General of the League of Arab States and
their teams. The Meeting, organized by the AU Permanent Delegation (AUPD) to the
League of Arab States, discussed implementation of the Resolutions of the 4 th Africa-
Arab Summit held in Malabo, November 2016, and developed a timeline leading up to a
joint Ministerial Meeting in early 2018 to examine a draft action plan for cooperation
between the two partners and adopt the agenda for the 5 th Africa-Arab Summit to be
held in Saudi Arabia in 2019.

517. In 2017, the Commission facilitated cooperation between the two partners which
resulted in re-operationalization of the Africa-Arab Cultural Institute and discussed ways
of enhancing its business plan.

518. Africa-Turkey: the Africa-Turkey Think Tank Forum did not take place as
planned in 2017. However, the 7th Senior Officials was held in June 2017 during which
the two sides agreed to enhance cooperation on focused areas. The Turkey Africa
Ministerial Review Conference will be held in February 2018.

AU REPRESENTATIONAL OFFICES

519. It will be recalled that the African Union ran Permanent Missions/Representations
in Brussels, Cairo, Geneva, at the UN Headquarters in New York and in Washington,
DC as well as Lilongwe Regional Office. The Permanent Missions promote AU
programmes, image and decisions of the Policy Organs and advocate for common
African positions and interests. They represent the African Union in multilateral and
bilateral forums, engage with the African diaspora where appropriate, and support the
work of the group of African ambassadors.

                                                                              Page 118

AU OBSERVER MISSION AT THE UNITED NATIONS

520. The signing in April 2017 of the Joint AU-UN Framework for Enhanced
Partnership in Peace and Security laid a firm foundation for partnership and cooperation
between the AU and the UN in matters of peace and security on the continent The Joint
AU-UN framework, facilitated by the AU Observer Mission to the United Nations (The
New York Office), is in line with the recognition by the UN High Level Independent
Panel on Peace Operations of the role the AU as a key UN strategic partner and, the
two organizations’ common aspirations for close coordination and cooperation based on
their comparative advantage.

521. Both the UN and the African Union have embarked on steps towards
implementation of the Joint Framework, in particular working together to evolve a joint
framework on sustainable development aimed at joint implementation of the 2030
Agenda and Agenda 2063 to be considered at the next United Nations-African Union
Annual Conference in 2018.

522. The true test of AU-UN strategic partnership in matters of peace and security
resides at the level of the UN Security Council and how it understands and appreciates
the role of regional organizations as provided for in Chapter VIII of the UN Charter
including its relationship with the African Union Peace and Security Council. Clearly,
the increasing contribution by regional organizations and sub-regional organizations
demonstrates that enhanced partnership based on the principle of burden-sharing can
indeed improve collective security and thus vindicates the incessant appeals by the
African Union for predictable, sustainable and flexible financing for regional
organizations when undertaking UN mandated peace keeping/peace support
operations.

523. The African Union is encouraged by steps taken by the three African Members of
the UN Security Council (A3) in advancing progress on the African Union position on
securing predictable and sustainable financing through UN Assessed contributions, for
UN-authorized AU-led peace support operations, through the adoption of Security
Council Resolutions, 2320 and 2378 under the Presidency of Senegal and Ethiopia,
respectively. The AU envisions further progress in this regard by securing a substantive
UN Security Council Resolution on the principle of the use of UN assessed contributions
to support AU peace support operations mandated by the UN Security Council under
Chapter VII on a case by case basis.

524. Recent steps by the UN Secretary-General on the reform of the UN Peace and
Security Architecture is duly noted and followed with keen interest particularly in areas
related to structural reform of the Department of Peacekeeping and Department of
Political and Peacebuilding Affairs. Africa’s interest in this process cannot be
overemphasized especially in addressing the question of the under-representation of
Africa in these structures. The appointment of an African Country, Rwanda, as co-
facilitator representing the global south to drive the intergovernmental process is
encouraging.
-----------------------Page 121 End-----------------------

                                                                         EX.CL/1061(XXXII)
                                                                                 Page 119


525. In terms of enhancing working relations between the two institutions, we remain
deeply committed to building on and further strengthening existing mechanisms of
coordination through, notably, the Annual Retreats, Annual desk-to-desk and, the Joint
Task Force, including regular consultations at the level of Principals.

526. The New York Office continued to support the alignment of Agenda 2063 with the
global 2030 Agenda. This is central to the collective efforts towards effective
implementation through an integrated and holistic approach that delivers results on the
ground, at regional and national levels. The AU’s ongoing efforts to domesticate
Agenda 2063 in all its member states should be viewed in this context. Effective means
of implementation as provided for in the Addis Ababa Action Plan continues to be
challenged by impediments associated with Domestic Resource Mobilization DRM),
amongst others. The African Union, therefore, looks forward to significant African
participation in the UNGA’s Financing for Development Forum scheduled to be held in
April 2018, followed by the SDGs financing to be held in June 2018.

527. The AU’s effort to mobilize international support and build alliance around the
question of illicit financial flows from Africa, through the work of the High-Level Panel on
Illicit Financial Flows from Africa, remained a high priority. Global political will and
response deserves collective attention and will aid in delivering on the commitments of
Agenda 2063 and its Ten Years Implementation Plan as well as the 2030 Agenda. In
that regard, the Commission looks forward to the implementation of General Assembly
Resolution adopted in December 2016 on “Illicit Financial Flows”, which was initiated by
the African Group. The Commission calls upon the African Group to sustain its
leadership in driving this important issue towards logical conclusion.

528. The New York Office continued to facilitate the collaboration between relevant
Departments of the Commission and the UN. Joint planning and organization of
thematic events featured Africa’s priorities as outlined in Agenda 2063 and its Ten
Years Implementation Plan.

529. The adoption of the General Assembly Resolution entitled, “Framework for a
Renewed United Nations-African Union Partnership on Africa’s Integration and
Development Agenda 2017-2027(A/71/L.50), also initiated by the African Group, as a
successor to the Ten Year Capacity Building Program, provides a solid basis for more
effective partnership between the AU and the UN in supporting Africa’s integration and
development agenda.

530. The AU reform agenda pre-supposes a review of the current structures and
organs of the Union in order to render them more fit for purpose to respond to current
day realities. Re-alignment of programs and policies will remain a central part of this
process. Representational Offices should be re-strengthened to deliver on the core
mandate of supporting the African Union’s global voice and representation.

THE AFRICAN UNION PERMANENT DELEGATION TO GENEVA

531. In 2017 the Permanent Delegation of the African Union in Geneva (the Geneva
Office) participated in the activities organized by the Geneva-based International
Organizations and Diplomatic Missions, and specifically in those of the African Group to
which it lent support in various ways in all the topics being addressed in the multilateral
arena. The Geneva Office was also involved in the main activities organized in Paris
and Vienna, particularly in campaigns in Madrid and Rome for the election of AU
endorsed African candidatures in the international system.

532. Human rights situation in several African countries occupied an important part of
the work of the United Nations Human Rights Council (HRC) throughout the year under
review. In general, the Member States concerned were able to reflect a positive spirit of
engagement and cooperation, while highlighting the specificities and advances they had
been able to achieve.

533. The Geneva Office also lent support and provided technical assistance to the
African Group on thematic issues of importance to the continent, including the right to
development, the fight against racism, the fight against gender-based and sexual
violence, and the exploitation of natural resources by multinational corporations.

534. The initiative of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and the
Swiss Confederation, with the support, in particular, of European Union Member States,
was the subject of difficult negotiations. This initiative aimed to strengthen the respect
for International Humanitarian Law (IHL) with a view to setting up a mechanism for
monitoring States' compliance with their obligations under the Geneva Conventions and
their additional protocols. Several delegations, including the African Group, expressed
concern over the risks of politicisation and contextualisation that could characterise this
new mechanism. They argued that the potential of existing mechanisms to ensure
respect for International humanitarian law – regional mechanisms, the International
Conference of the Red Cross and Red Crescent – needed to be explored further before
envisaging to establish a new mechanism. It is particularly around these views that
negotiations will continue to try to reach an agreement that will be validated in
December 2019 by the International Conference of the Red Cross and Red Crescent.

535. With regard to intellectual property (WIPO), during 2017, the Geneva Office
provided technical and logistical assistance to the African Group during the negotiations
on this issue in the areas of traditional knowledge, exceptions and limitations to
copyright, patents, industrial designs and development issues. This enabled the African
Group to make its voice heard in a coordinated manner and to effectively defend
Africa’s interests. As a result, the African Group obtained that a diplomatic conference
on industrial design law would only be convened if there was an agreement on technical
issues, including the disclosure of the origin of the traditional knowledge contained in
the applications for registration of such designs.
-----------------------Page 123 End-----------------------

                                                                       EX.CL/1061(XXXII)
                                                                               Page 121


536. The Geneva Office contributed to the preparation of the African position prior to
the 11th WTO Ministerial Conference (MC11) by providing all the necessary assistance
to the African Group. It organized a retreat of the Ambassadors and Experts of the
African Group in Geneva on 6 and 7 July 2017, with the participation of a strong
delegation from the Commission. During the retreat, the African Group undertook an in-
depth review of all Doha Round negotiating issues and other trade-related matters, and
held a series of brainstorming sessions in order to develop common positions towards
MC11 deliverables. The outcome of the retreat informed the deliberations of the
informal Ministerial Meeting that later took place in Addis Ababa in September 2017,
with the aim of preparing Africa to speak with one voice during the upcoming
negotiations.

537. Concerning the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development
(UNCTAD), the Geneva Office assisted the African Group for a better implementation of
the Nairobi "Maafikiano" outcome that will ensure that Africa draws maximum benefits
from UNCTAD decisions. The Geneva Office will participate in the meetings convened
by this UN agency, using among others the outcome of UNCTAD XIV which was held in
Nairobi as a guide.

538. The Geneva Office prepared the reports on the activities of the African Union
members of the International Labour Organization (ILO) for the Specialized Technical
Committee on Social Development, Labour and Employment, which were used in
preparation of the annual ILO International Labour Conference. One major issue of
concern during the reporting period was the slow progress in the ratification of the 1986
Instrument of Amendment of the ILO Constitution, which once entered into force will,
inter alia, democratize the ILO Governing Body by eliminating 'permanent seats'
occupied by ten countries – Brazil, China, France, Germany, Italy, India, Japan, Russia,
the USA and the United Kingdom. Through the insistence of the African Group, this
issue remains a standing item on the ILO agenda. Another issue of importance to the
African Union was the review of rules of regional meetings. The African Group has
proposed principles governing the participation of non-African states in the African
regional meetings. The amendments to the rules itself will be based on these principles
adopted by the ILO Governing Body.

539. In a bid to increase coordination and cohesion between the Commission and the
Geneva Office on the issue of migration, the Geneva Office facilitated the contribution of
the African Group experts to the draft Common African Position (CAP) on the Global
Compact on Migration (GCM). The contributions were submitted to the STC on
Migration, Refugees and IDPs and integrated into the current draft to be considered by
the January 2018 summit. The increase in south-south migratory flows led the African
Ambassadors in Geneva to reflect on a joint contribution of the global south to the GCM
process. This work is ongoing in coordination with countries from Asia and South
America in areas of common concern.
-----------------------Page 124 End-----------------------

                                                                      EX.CL/1061(XXXII)
                                                                              Page 122

540. With respect to the African candidatures in the international system that were
endorsed by the Executive Council in 2017, two eminent sons of Africa were elected at
the helm of two international organisations, namely H.E. Mr. Gilbert Fossoun
HOUNGBO, former Prime Minister of the Republic of Togo, as President of The
International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) based in Rome, and H.E. Dr.
Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Former Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Federal
Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, as Director General of the Geneva-based World
Health Organization (WHO).

541. The success of the campaigns was the result of the solidarity and cohesion of all
African missions in Geneva, in coordination with the African Group at the United Nations
Headquarters. The Geneva Office acted as a catalyst for the mobilization of the African
Group in Geneva, which involved African ambassadors and the Geneva Office in
lobbying hundreds of Member States represented in Geneva. It could not be replicated
in Paris and, especially, Madrid where the African Union ended up with two candidates
vying for the same position and in Paris where, despite an intensive campaign, the
African candidate did not benefit from all the African voices. It would therefore be
opportune for the Organization to initiate a reflection with the RECs and other
stakeholders on the broader issue of supporting African candidatures in the multilateral
system.

AU PERMANENT MISSION IN BRUSSELS

542. The AU Permanent Mission in Brussels (the Brussels Office) serves as the
Secretariat for the African Group of Ambassadors in Brussels and convenes monthly
meetings of the Group to sensitize them on AU positions and ensure a follow-up of
implementation of AU decisions. The Office also continued to facilitate the activities of
the African Group.

543. During the period under review, the Brussels Office focused on the
implementation of the cooperation instruments between Africa and the European Union,
in addition to the monitoring of the AU’s working relations with the EU institutions,
notably in the context of implementation and follow-up of the AU-EU Partnership and its
Roadmap 2014-2017, as well as preparation of the 5th AU-EU Summit in Abidjan, Cote
d’Ivoire, in November 2017.

544. AU-EU Summit Preparations: The Brussels Office participated in all EU
coordination meetings to follow-up on activities, projects and programmes in the various
sectors defined in the 2014-2017 Strategic Plan. It supported the work of the Joint AU-
EU Steering Committee for organization of the Summit and the PRC’s negotiating
position. The Brussels Office also coordinated several meetings and briefings between
the African Group and the PRC both in Brussels and in Addis Ababa, which resulted in
an enriched contribution to the AU-EU Summit outcome documents, which were
adopted by the Executive Council.
-----------------------Page 125 End-----------------------

                                                                       EX.CL/1061(XXXII)
                                                                               Page 123

545. Post-Cotonou: Regarding the expiration of the ACP-EU Cotonou Agreement by
February 2020 and the need to reflect on the post-2020 relations, the Brussels Office
and the African Group of Ambassadors in Brussels set up a working group to help
define an African common position on this important matter. Detailed reports and
documents, including a Concept Note on the various possible options and scenarios on
the future of the ACP Group and ACP-EU post-2020 relations, were provided by the
Brussels Office to the Sub-Committee on Multilateral Cooperation and the PRC. The
Brussels Office briefed the PRC and its Sub-Committee on Multilateral Cooperation on
this issue in Addis Ababa and Brussels.

546. Meanwhile, the Brussels Office continued to attend the meetings of the ACP
Group, particularly the meetings of the ACP Committee of Ambassadors, in order to
guide African Ambassadors on AU positions on the items under discussion. The Mission
was present at the sessions of the ACP Council of Ministers held in May 2017, during
which it helped to sensitize the African Ministers on the need to defer any decision on
the future of the ACP Group until a final decision is taken by the Policy Organs. The
Brussels Office also attended the meeting of the ACP Committee of Ministers of Trade
held in October 2017 in Brussels, as well as the ACP and the ACP-EU Parliamentary
Assemblies during which the Brussels Office stressed the need to harmonize the
positions of African Member States in these institutions in line with the decisions of the
Policy Organs.

547. Representation, Advocacy, Public Relations: During the period under review,
the Brussels Office regularly reached out to international partners, the media and other
stakeholders in the EU to communicate and advocate for AU positions in all relevant
spheres of interest. It also set up an AU Diaspora Youth Platform to strengthen
relationship with the African Diaspora in Europe.

548. Several actions are needed by the AU to address the discrepancy between the
ACP, the EU and the AU and their parallel processes on the ACP relations post-2020.
On this matter, the Policy Organs should accelerate the consideration and adoption of
an African Common Position on the issue.

AU REPRESENTATIONAL MISSION TO THE UNITED STATES

549. The AU Representational Mission to the United States supports the partnership
and dialogue between the U.S. Government and the African Union Commission.

550. High level partnership meetings: The Mission organized the 5th Annual African
Union Commission-United States High-Level Dialogue in Washington, D.C., in
November 2017, followed by a bilateral meeting between the Chairperson and the
Secretary of State.

551. African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA): AGOA was re-authorized under
President Barack Obama for another ten years (2015-2025). The Commission and the
UN Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA) continued to encourage Member States
-----------------------Page 126 End-----------------------

                                                                         EX.CL/1061(XXXII)
                                                                                 Page 124

to adopt national AGOA strategies in order to maximize benefits from AGOA. The
Commission, UNECA and the Africa Group of AGOA Eligible Countries organized in
Washington, D.C, in July 2017, a Mid-Term Review meeting to prepare for the Forum.
One of the recommendations was to set up a consultative committee comprising of
representatives from the African Ambassadors Group (AAG), US agencies involved in
AGOA implementation, the private sector, civil society and NGOs in Washington, D.C.
to monitor all AGOA related issues. In August 2017, the Commission took part in the
AGOA Forum that was held in Lomé.

552. Coordination of African positions: The Mission continued to play a key role in
coordinating the African Ambassadors Group (AAG) to advance the common African
interest. It serves as a Secretariat for the African Diplomatic Corps and hosts the latter’s
monthly meetings. The Mission also hosts meetings of the AAG’s various committees
on AGOA, Capacity Building, Media and Africa Day celebrations.

553. Outreach: The Group supports the AU Diaspora outreach programmes through
various media channels. An Editorial Board composed by media officers from
Embassies is created to implement the initiative.

AU PERMANENT DELEGATION TO THE LEAGUE OF ARAB STATES

554. The African Union Permanent Delegation (the Cairo Office) to the League of
Arab States (LAS) coordinates and manages relations with the Secretary General of the
LAS, the embassies of the observer countries to the AU, as well as the institutions of
the host country.

555. Africa-Arab Partnership Meetings: In 2017, the Cairo Office continued to
coordinate the Africa-Arab partnership with the League of Arab States. Together, they
facilitated the meeting of the partnership coordination committee at the ministerial level
in New York in September 2017. The ministers examined resolutions of the Malabo
Summit (2016) and drew up plans to implement those resolutions. The Cairo Office also
facilitated the meeting between the Chairperson of the Commission and the LAS
Secretary General. The two principals exchanged views on issues of common concern,
including conflicts and crises agitating the two regions and progress in the
implementation of the decisions of the Malabo Summit. They also took the opportunity
to commemorate forty years of Africa-Arab partnership.

556. The Cairo Office also continued to follow up on cooperation between the two
Organizations on the Palestinian question, through its contribution to the Commission’s
reports and draft resolutions on this issue.

557. Support to the African Group: The Cairo Office hosted and took part in the
meetings of the African Group of Ambassadors.

558. Communication and Outreach: the Cairo Office conducted communication and
outreach activities in order to popularize the work of the AU and Agenda 2063, including
the following:

          Drafting of press releases on all partnership meetings and other significant
           events;

          Sponsoring research and training sessions organized by Egyptian research
           institutes on African affairs at the Universities of Cairo, Assiout and
           Alexandria;

          Strengthen relations with the African Affairs Committee of the Egyptian

AU OFFICE IN SOUTHERN AFRICA LILONGWE (AU_SARO)

559. In order to assist Member States in addressing problems of conflict and
insecurity, as well as promoting economic growth, AU-SARO, in collaboration for
UNECA office for Southern Africa, has conducted a series of activities in 2017, listed
below:

          INDUSTRIALIZATION: Various meetings were organized to promote
           regional industrialization strategies and plans, in line with Agenda 2063. A
           programme called "100 young people in the world of real business every
           year", which has a direct bearing on the theme of the year on youth and the
           need for industrialization, was initiated and promoted by the African Union
           Regional Office. The programme aims to systematically introduce 100
           young people into the private sector every year, specifically into industry,
           agro-processing, manufacturing of goods etc. With the assumption that
           these young people will create jobs for themselves and then for other young
           people. The programme is also geared towards the production of goods at
           national level, which could be exported to the sub-region.

          ELECTRIFICATION THROUGH GEOTHERMAL ENERGY: Informational
           campaigns were carried out in the countries where the project was targeted,
           through the distribution of different project related documents to the
           ministries concerned.

          DOMESTICATION: Sensitization on various key AU and African documents
           were conducted with a view to facilitate their domestication. Target groups
           for the sensitization were relevant ministries within Member States of the
           region. Documents included projects of the Programme for Infrastructure
           Development in Africa (PIDA), as well as Agenda 2063 and its First Ten-
           Year Implementation Plan. Working meetings were also organized with
           SADC, the African Union, the Common Market for Eastern and Southern
           Africa (COMESA) and the Pan-African Parliament (PAP) to define a

    common strategy for domestication of the legal instruments of these
    institutions by Member States.

   SOUTHERN AFRICAN YOUTH INVOLVEMENT: To ensure greater
    visibility of the AU and participation in activities of the Union, AU-SARO
    promoted the creation of youth clubs in universities. Currently, 11 clubs are
    operational and 380 young people are members. Countries where the clubs
    exist are: Botswana, South Africa, Namibia, Lesotho, Swaziland, Angola,
    Democratic Republic of Congo, Zambia, Tanzania, Malawi and
    Mozambique.

CONCLUSION:          FOCUS FOR THE YEAR 2018

560. The Commission has come a long way as an institution, and has made a
tremendous amount of progress particularly at the level of development of strategic and
normative frameworks. However, the continent continues to be faced with numerous
challenges with respect to poverty alleviation, growth, inequality, fragility of democratic
governance in some of its countries. The continent is also not as integrated as it should
be. Clearly, a gap exists between the grand strategic promise of Agenda 2063 and
reality and execution on the ground.

Recommendations and issues for decisions

561. Member States, the RECs, and all AU Organs need to align their development
plans with Agenda 2063 and its first ten-year implementation plan. The Agenda 2063
monitoring and evaluation framework will be submitted for the adoption of the Policy
Organs at the January 2018 summit. It was endorsed by the STC on Finance, Monetary
Affairs, Economic Planning and Integration in October 2017.

562. Domestic resources are also needed to accelerate the implementation of Agenda
2063 flagship programs and projects. The STC on Finance, Monetary Affairs, Economic
Planning and Integration adopted the draft domestic resource mobilization strategy for
Agenda 2063 in October 2017 and recommended it for the adoption of the Policy
Organs at the January 2018 summit.

563. The Policy Organs should encourage Member States to apply without delay the
Kigali Decision on financing the Union. There is an overriding need within the Union and
its Organs for adequate human and financial resources to enable them carry out their
mandate. Implementation of the Kigali Decision aims to reduce the Union’s dependence
on partner funds for its programs.

564. AU Organs should also comply strictly with AU financial and administrative rules
and regulations, as well as the recommendations of audit reports. The Commission has
initiated the holding of regular meetings with the Heads of Organs to discuss policy
alignment issues, as well as financial and management challenges.

565. Lastly, the Policy Organs should encourage Member States to sign and ratify all
OAU/AU treaties and human rights instruments. In fulfilment of the Union’s integration
agenda, the Policy Organs should pay special attention to the signing and ratification of
the CFTA agreement, the Yamoussoukro Decision and the Protocol on the Free
Movement of Persons, to enable their speedy entry into force. Member States should
also conclude without delay the remaining negotiations on the draft Protocol on Goods
and submit it for the adoption of the relevant Policy Organs.

2018 Priorities Forecast

566. In 2018, therefore, the Commission’s attention will be focused identifying key
levers and vectors for bridging the gap between ambition and aspiration, on the one
hand; and action and concrete delivery, on the other hand. This, in itself, is a mammoth
-----------------------Page 130 End-----------------------

                                                                      EX.CL/1061(XXXII)
                                                                              Page 128

task and involves introducing changes both within the Commission and in relation to its
engagement with AU Organs and other stakeholders.

567. The following are areas that the Union will focus its attention on, in addition to
the mandates of the Commission and its individual Departments, the Organs and
Agencies:

      (1)    Policy Coherence

568. Acknowledging that the objectives of Agenda 2063 cannot be achieved without
effective governance and management systems, the Commission will give dedicated
attention to addressing internal coherence challenges that impede the effectiveness and
efficiency of the Commission.

569. As a starting point, the Commission intends to address two major areas: first, the
patent policy and programmatic overlaps and gaps that exist between the AUC and
other Organs of the Union. The Commission has initiated a study to produce a range of
options for streamlining mandates, strengthening joint strategic planning and budgeting,
priority-setting, programme implementation, information-sharing and reporting of
legislative, judicial and human rights Organs. This exercise is directed at introducing
more opportunities for closer and effective collaboration between other AU Organs.

570. The second area pertains to the relationship between the Commission and its
Specialized Agencies. In this regard, the Commission will shortly commence an
evaluative study to determine and strengthen the current and potential value to be
derived from Specialised Agencies. Aspects of these studies will contribute towards the
achievement of a number of milestones of the roadmap for institutional reform of the
Union.

      (2)    Governance and Management

571. There is need for the Commission itself as an Organ to give dedicated attention
to the overall improvement of its organization, systems and procedures. Diagnostic
work has already been done in this area to identify the gaps and challenges that need to
be addressed in order to improve overall institutional performance. The result of this
work has been the production of a “State of Play Report” that has provided the
Commission with a range of reforms that need to be undertaken in order to render the
Commission fit for purpose. This year, the Commission will put much effort into the first
phase of the implementation of the organizational reform options provided.

      (3)    Visibility

572. The Commission is mindful that a large proportion of the African population is
unfamiliar with the work of the African Union. In 2018, the Commission will enhance and
expand existing modes of stakeholder communication, feedback and participation. The
Commission will focus its attention on developing expanded platforms for information
sharing with private and public stakeholders in the continent and beyond. A key vector
for achieving this will be structured agreements with mainstream media platforms in

                                                                      EX.CL/1061(XXXII)
                                                                              Page 129

Member States to publicize the Commission and its work, expanding digital
communication with disaggregated sectors of Africa’s population, particularly the youth,
women and the diaspora, creating an interactive website for the Union, re-branding the
Union including all its Organs, and introducing town hall meetings for the Chairperson of
the Union and the Chairperson of the Commission to engage with citizens in Member
States. These measures, in addition to others, will serve to bring the AU to the people.

      (4)    Regional Integration

573. The transformation of the continent’s economic growth to an inclusive continental
economy is a critical imperative for Africa. The RECs are pivotal vectors to ensure that
this goal is actualized. Therefore, the Commission intends to scale up its levels of
engagement with the RECs in order to jointly agree on division of labour between the
RECS and the AUC. Specifically, the Commission intends to introduce regular meetings
schedule between the AUC and the RECS. Alongside these engagements, an in-depth
study has been commissioned to produce a comprehensive and effective framework for
strengthened collaboration.

      (5)    Peace, Security and Governance

574. The Commission will continue in 2018 to associate the AU with peace efforts in
Member States by playing a supportive role in securing sustainable peace, security and
governance in the continent. To do so, the Commission will continue to make sustained
efforts towards conflict prevention, management and resolution, as well as advance the
implementation of the AU instruments relating to governance, democracy and human
rights. Efforts will also continue to prevent and combat terrorism.

      (6)    Partnerships

575. In line with the strategic imperative of strengthening of the AU’s role as a
preeminent regional institution, and Africa’s position in the global arena, the
Commission will develop a strategy on Africa’s global voice and representation for AU
Policy Organ’s approval. Furthermore, the Commission will strengthen the effectiveness
of AU Representational Offices to enable them to deepen the AU’s global engagement
and advocacy. This will entail bolstering of the capacity of these offices, strengthening
performance, accountability and reporting mechanisms, and demanding evidence-
based outcomes that demonstrate the strengthening of Africa’s relations with other
continental blocs and its influence at the global level.

576. In this endeavour, the Commission and other AU Organs will continue to depend
on the good will and support of the Policy Organs, as it has been the case in the past.
