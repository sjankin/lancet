EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
(1).

Economic growth and poverty reduction are entrenched within the Revised Indicative
Strategic Development Plan (RISDP) priority areas: industrial and market integration,
infrastructure, peace and security, and regional programmes and calls for concerted effort
by the Secretariat and the Member States to collectively work towards implementation of
the common goals, realization of greater impact and achievement of regional integration.

(2).

The year 2017 marked the third year of implementation of the SADC 2015-2020 Revised
Regional Indicative Strategic Development Plan and Implementation Framework (Revised
RISDP) following its adoption by the SADC Summit of Heads of State and Government in
April 2015. Since the adoption, the Secretariat remains committed to the implementation
of the Revised RISDP, which underpins the SADC Vision of sustainable economic growth
and development in order to improve the quality of life of the SADC citizenry and ensure
peace and security in the region.

(3).

This Report of the SADC Executive Secretary provides major achievements on milestones
for 2017/18 towards the regional integration agenda in the SADC region in terms of political
and economic developments; implementation of programmes; resource mobilization
efforts; efforts towards good governance and the rule of law; challenges and mitigation
measures.

A. Political Developments in the SADC Region for 2017/18
(4).

The political and security situation in the Region has remained generally calm and peaceful
with the SADC collective efforts being focused on addressing political and security
challenges in the Kingdom of Lesotho, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and the
Republic of Madagascar.

(5).

Efforts of the SADC Facilitator, the Oversight Committee and the deployment of the SADC
Preventive Mission to Lesotho (SAPMIL) were instrumental in stabilizing the political, and
security situation in the Kingdom. Extended efforts to the Democratic Republic of Congo
(DRC) significantly neutralized the negative forces operating mainly in the Eastern part of
the country. Whilst the deployment of the Special Envoy, H.E. Joaquim Chissano, in
collaboration with Envoys from the United Nations and African Union were instrumental in
facilitating the resolution of the political crisis in Madagascar over the disputed provisions
of the proposed electoral law.

B. Economic Developments in the SADC Region for 2017/18
(6).

In the past six (6) years, the Region has experienced dampened economic growth, the
lowest being 1.4 per cent in 2016. Real GDP growth increased marginally by 1.9% in 2017.
A majority of Member States have per capita GDP below US$1,000. The weak economic
climate has affected the financial sector as indicated by rising non-performing loans.

(7).

While inflation has slowed down in general, it has remained high with some Member States
still in the double digit levels. Weak exchange rates and the aftermath impacts of weather1

-----------------------Page 8 End-----------------------

related factors including drought of 2015-16 continued to influence price movements in
some of the Member States.
(8).

In the fiscal sector, public revenues have remained low and in some instances declining
in the face of increasing public expenditures. In some Member States, wage bills have
been driving expenditures and accounting for a significant percentage of public
expenditure. Some Member States have introduced (or contemplating to introduce)
minimum wages as an income redistributive mechanism. These factors have partly
contributed to deteriorating fiscal positions of most Member States.

C. Implementation of Programmes of Regional Cooperation and Integration
C1. Industrial Development and Market Integration
(9).

The SADC Industrialisation Strategy and Roadmap and its Costed Action plan was
popularized and rolled out in eight (8) Member States, where all stakeholders including the
private sector and civil society participated. The roll out also included support to seven (7)
Member States to estimate national indicative public coordination costs for the
implementation of the Strategy.

(10). The Secretariat, in collaboration with the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa
(UNECA) developed a draft Regional Mining Vision (RMV) and Action Plan whose
objective is to maximize the developmental impact of mineral resources extraction within
the overarching context of the African Mining Vision (AMV) and the SADC industrialisation
Strategy.
(11). The Secretariat has secured resources from GIZ and the European Commission to support
the development of regional value chains in selected Agro processing and
Pharmaceuticals sub sectors. Implementation is expected to commence in the next
financial year.
(12). The Africa Green Co project covering Zambia, Botswana, Mozambique and Namibia and
the Renewable Energy Agency Guidelines and Standards for Mauritius were added to the
SADC Project Preparation Development Facility (SADC - PPDF). This brings the total
number of projects financed under this Facility to nine (9).
(13). SADC continues to support the modernization and harmonization of payments and
clearing systems as a means of financing priority sectors and driving economic
development in the region. The SADC Integrated Regional Electronic Settlement System
(SIRESS) made further progress and consolidation since July 2013, when the system went
live. As at end of April 2018, cumulative total number of 1,063,306 transactions were
settled, representing ZAR 4.46 trillion equivalent of USD 377.14 billion. All Member States
are participating in SIRESS with exception of Madagascar.
(14). In order to be an inclusive payment system, SIRESS can now also settle low value
payments starting in the four Common Monetary Authorities countries of Lesotho, Namibia,
Eswatini and South Africa. Work on the registration of SIRESS trademark in all Member
2

-----------------------Page 9 End-----------------------

States is underway as a mitigating measure against hijacking of the SIRESS trademark to
a third parties.
C.3 Improved and integrated regional infrastructure
(15). The Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Strategy and Action Plan (REEESAP) was
approved by Committee of Ministers responsible for Energy in July 2017 as a strategy for
guiding development of regional renewable energy and energy efficiency programmes
until 2030.
(16). Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) from nine (9) SADC Member States are implementing
the SADC Home and Away Roaming (SHAR) project using the Roam Like at Home
(RLAH) principle. This is in line with the November 2014 decision of Ministers responsible
for ICT, to adopt the Roam Like At Home regime by regulating both the wholesale and
retail-roaming tariff using the glide paths for the next six (6) years.
(17). Since the launch of the Tripartite Transport and Transit Facilitation Programme (TTTFP)
by the Tripartite Ministers in October 2017 in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, the achieved
milestones to date include development and validation of a Vehicle Load Management
Agreement; Multilateral Cross Border Road Transport Agreement; national and regional
sensitization in 17 of the 21 Tripartite Member/Partner States to identify technical
assistance requirements; and facilitation of the Cross Border Road Transport Regulators
Forum.
(18). The Kunene Transboundary Water Supply Project shared by Angola and Namibia
progressed as planned with the construction of the Calueque Village Water Treatment
Works and the repairs on the rising main pipeline and the canal being successfully
completed and commissioned by end of March 2018. This constitute the completion of lot
1 of the Project. Lot 2 which entails construction and rehabilitation of water storage and
distribution network at Santa Clara commenced in June 2018 as planned and a consultant
is in place. Work will be completed in June 2019.
(19). The SADC Groundwater Management Institute (GMI) was fully established and staffed
with four (4) technical staff and the Executive Director, in the Institute of Groundwater
Studies, University of Free State. The SADC GMI Financial Sustainability Plan and
Strategy was developed, reviewed and endorsed by the relevant technical committees
including the Sub-committee for Groundwater, and the Water Resources Technical
Committee, and approved by the Committee of Ministers responsible for Water at their
meeting in June 2018.
C.3 Peace and Security
(20). An Electoral Technical Committee comprising of members of SADC Electoral Advisory
Council (SEAC) and the Electoral Commissions Forum of SADC Countries (ECF-SADC)
was commissioned by the 2017 SADC Summit to conduct a pre-election assessment
Mission to the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The Summit tasked the Committee
to assess the electoral administration capacity and technical needs of the National
3

-----------------------Page 10 End-----------------------

Independent Electoral Commission (CENI) ahead of the country’s anticipated national
elections.
(21). The SADC Preventive Mission in Lesotho (SAPMIL) was deployed to Lesotho in November
2017 to address the fragile and unpredictable political and security situation associated
with the assassination of the former Commander of the Lesotho Defence Force (LDF),
Lieutenant General Khoantlhe Motšomotšo. The Mission’s mandate was extended by the
Double Troika Summit to November 2018 to continue to underpin the region’s resolve to
ensure stability.
(22). The Mediation Support Unit (MSU) accelerated its capacity building interventions aimed at
deepening regional capability to prevent and manage conflict, through training
programmes that covered negotiation, conflict tracking and analysis; mediation skills and
approaches and; gender mainstreaming within the context of conflict prevention and
response.
(23). The Secretariat continued to implement programmes to enhance Cross Border Security,
migration and refugee management. This Security agenda is driven by drafting Policies
and Strategies that address Corruption, Refugees, Migration, Poaching, Prisons and
Border Management. In order to effectively discharge this responsibility, the Sector
consults and deliberately engages with experts in Sub- Sub Sectors so as to inform Policy.
In 2017/2018, with input from its Statutory Committees, the Secretariat achieved a number
of milestones including development of i) draft Common Position on implementation of the
African Union Protocol on Free Movement of Persons; ii) draft Protocol on Inter-State
Transfer of Foreign Prisoners; iii) draft Regional Policy Framework on Management of
Asylum Seekers and Refugees; and iv) draft SADC Anti –Corruption Strategic Action Plan
2018-2022.
C.4 Improved human capacities for socio-economic development
(24). The Region developed the Agricultural Development Fund (ADF) as a financial
mechanism intended to provide financial support to accelerate the implementation of the
Regional Agricultural Investment Plan (RAIP) 2017-2022, which in turn implements the
Regional Agricultural Policy (RAP). The ADF Operational Guidelines were developed and
approved by Ministers Responsible for Agriculture and Food Security in May 2017, and by
Council in August 2017. Work is in progress to operationalize the Fund.
(25). The Regional Early Warning System and Vulnerability Assessment programme continued
to collect, analyse and disseminate data and information on the food security situation in
the region. The information is aimed at facilitating preparedness and early action in order
to prevent or reduce the impact of food insecurity related disasters.
(26). The SADC Secretariat in collaboration with Member states developed the Harmonised
Seed Regulatory System (HSRS) to promote regional integration and enhance access and
availability of improved crop variety to farmers. The System augments the fundamental
role played by quality seed in the realisation of a food security. The framework is
implemented through the MOU that is currently signed by eleven (11) Member States and
came into operation after more than two-thirds of Member States had signed it. To-date
4

-----------------------Page 11 End-----------------------

the HSRS has managed to release and register 25 crop varieties that can be traded
throughout the region without undergoing tedious steps of variety release at national level.
(27). A Regional Monitoring and Evaluation Framework for the SADC Transfrontier
Conservation Areas (TFCAs) has been developed to assess progress made in the
implementation of the SADC TFCA Programme to enable objective measurement of its
contribution to the objectives of relevant Protocols as well as SADC development priorities
as stipulated in the revised Regional Indicative Strategic Development Plan.
(28). During the 2017/18 period, the Employment and Labour Sector deepened its
implementation of the SADC Code on Social Security of 2007 and the SADC Cross Border
Portability of Accrued Social Security Benefits Framework of 2016. The SADC Secretariat
commissioned two (2) ongoing assessment studies on the state of social protection access
and potential for portability of benefits for migrant workers in the agricultural and mining
sectors in pilot SADC Member States.
(29). The Implementation Plan for the SADC Strategy on Nutrition relating to Social & Human
Development was developed and approved by the Joint meeting of SADC Ministers of
Health and Ministers responsible for HIV and AIDS in November 2017.
C.5 Cross cutting issues
(30). The SADC Regional Strategy for HIV and AIDS Prevention, Treatment and Care and
Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights among Key Populations was developed and
approved to promote the adoption and institutionalisation of a standard, comprehensive
package that addresses the unique challenges in providing equitable and effective HIV
and Sexual Reproductive Health (SRH) rights and services to key populations in SADC.
(31). Support was provided to Member States on issues regarding primary and subordinate
legislation on trafficking in persons. In addition, awareness Raising Campaigns on
trafficking in persons, as well as capacity building initiatives on trafficking in persons were
also conducted.
(32). The Draft Charter on Women in Science, Engineering and Technology was approved by
Council in August 2017, Pretoria, South Africa. The aim of the Charter is to increase the
participation of women and youth in the fields of Science, Technology, Engineering and
Mathematics (STEM). Shortage of skills in STEM is one of the key barriers identified in the
Industrialisation Strategy.
(33). Selected Indicators comprising of macroeconomic and social statistics were used to
produce an annual bulletin of the SADC region on economic performance, trade
liberalization and demographic characteristics. The bulletin highlights SADC programme
efforts in terms of increased intra-SADC trade, life expectancy and industrial output.

5

-----------------------Page 12 End-----------------------

D. The major challenges in 2017/18
(34). Capacity gaps in monitoring and evaluation at Directorates/Units level to facilitate timely
corrective actions during the course of programmes’ implementation.
(35). Complex and lengthy approval and disbursement processes.
(36). The existing recruitment systems, including the Quota Points System, which do not
facilitate efficiency and quick turnaround times. This affected the timely filling of vacant
positions resulting in slow implementation of programmes.
E. Mitigation measures in 2017/18
(37). Annual training sessions were conducted on Results Based Management and Project
Cycle Management. These were envisioned to contribute towards strengthening of the
planning, monitoring and evaluation capacity of Directorates/Units.
(38). Continued to train SADC Secretariat Staff on the use of all automated management
systems aimed at enhancing compliance and efficiency.

DEVELOPMENTS

AND

(2).

The political and security situation in the region remained peaceful and stable in
2017/18 reporting period despite a few challenges that continued to prevail in Lesotho,
the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Madagascar.

(3).

Combined efforts of the SADC Facilitator, the Oversight Committee and the
deployment of the SADC Preventive Mission to Lesotho (SAPMIL) were instrumental
in stabilizing the political, and security situation; and facilitation of conduct of
constitutional, judicial, parliamentary, public service and security sector reforms in the
Kingdom of Lesotho. The SAPMIL was deployed by the Double Troika in Luanda in
November 2017 for 13 months.

(4).

Extended efforts to the DRC significantly neutralized the negative forces operating
mainly in the Eastern part the country. Continued SADC Support was extended during
implementation of the December 31 st 2016 Political Agreement in preparation for the
December 2018 Presidential and Parliamentary Elections. The Regional efforts were
complemented on the ground by the SADC Liaison Office based in Kinshasa since
April 2018.

(5).

The Special Envoy, H.E. Joaquim Chissano, in collaboration with Envoys from the
United Nations and African Union were instrumental in facilitating the resolution of the
7

-----------------------Page 14 End-----------------------

political crisis in Madagascar over the disputed provisions of the proposed electoral
law. Complementary efforts by the High Constitutional Court of Madagascar further
led to the appointment of a consensus Prime Minister and a transitional Government
in June 2018, that will facilitate the November 2018 elections.
(6).

2.1.2

In 2018-19, strategies and efforts will continue to be geared towards enhancing peace
and security, consolidation of democracy and the rule of law, strengthening of good
governance mechanisms and tools, and upholding of democratic principles in the
region.
Regional Collective Defence and Security strengthening

(7).

In line with the African Standby Force (ASF) objective of promoting Peace, Security
and Stability in Africa, the SADC Standby Force (SADC SF) will be on the ASF Roster
from 1 January to 30 June 2019. Accordingly, for the purpose of force preparation, a
SADCSF Command Post Exercise (CPX) will be conducted in Malawi in October
2018. The approval to conduct the CPX is subsequent to the attainment of Full
Operational Capability (FOC) of the African Standby Force (ASF) of which the SADC
SF is part. The Exercise will enable the SADCSF to prepare for the assumption of its
responsibility to provide the African Union with capabilities to respond to conflicts
through the deployment of multi-dimensional peacekeeping forces, and to undertake
interventions pursuant to Article 4(h) and (j) of the AU Constitutive Act.

(8).

Other areas related to the strengthened role and operational readiness of the
SADCSF include a review of the SADCSF Generic Status of Forces Agreement
(SOFA) and the construction of the SADC Regional Logistics Depot (RLD) with the
conclusion of the first phase comprising bush clearing and fencing of the 19 hectares
of the plot, which will accommodate the infrastructure and facilities of the RLD.
Development and approval of the Resource Mobilization Strategy by the Ministerial
Committee of the Organ (MCO) in June 2018 marked a significant milestone. The
Strategy calls for funding from Member States (seed capital) and International
Cooperating Partners (ICP’s) over a construction period of 5 years up to 2023.

(9).

The Secretariat prepared a Concept Note in line with the 2002 Protocol relating to the
establishment of the Peace and Security Council of the African Union, which provides
for the establishment of a Peace Fund to provide readily available and predictable
funding for SADC Peace and Security initiatives in line with the Constitutive Act of the
African Union; the African Peace and Security Architecture; the SADC Treaty; the
SADC Protocol on Politics, Defence and Security Cooperation; the SADC Mutual
Defence Pact, 2003; and the Memorandum of Understanding establishing the SADC
SF. This important mechanism will be considered by Council at its seating in August
2018.

(10).

Regional efforts in support of the peace, security and stability of the Democratic
Republic of Congo (DRC) continued, whereby engagements were done with the
United Nations, specifically on the strengthening of the operational capability of the
Force Intervention Brigade (FIB) deployed under the UN Mission in the DRC
(MONUSCO). The follow–up engagement meeting between SADC Chiefs of Defence
and UN Secretariat (Under-Secretaries-General for the Departments of
8

-----------------------Page 15 End-----------------------

Peacekeeping Operations and for Field Support) in February 2018, led to the
deployment of a Joint UN-SADC Task Force (JTF) to assess the operational
capability of FIB in fighting the Negative Forces in the Eastern DRC, in May 2018.
Among others it was agreed that a “Proposed Structure of the Enhanced FIB” will be
submitted as the working model, subject to approval by the United Nations General
Assembly of the envelope for the FIB as contained in MONUSCO’s 2018-19 proposed
budget. This is an ongoing matter to be concluded by September 2018, to ensure
deployment of the enhanced FIB in anticipation of the elections of December 2018.
2.1.3

Democratic Institutions Consolidation in the Region

(11).

The consolidation of democratic principles and standards in the Region continued in
2017. The SADC Electoral Observer Mission (SEOM) supported by the SADC
Electoral Advisory Council (SEAC) conducted observation missions to the snap
Elections in the Kingdom of Lesotho in June 2017; and the General Elections in the
Republic of Angola in August 2017. This resulted in peaceful, credible and transparent
elections in both countries.

(12).

The SEOM will extend its assistance to four Member States namely the DRC,
Republics of Madagascar and Zimbabwe, and the Kingdom of Eswatini during
elections in 2018. Lessons learned and areas for improvement were documented
during the elections in Lesotho and Angola and will be used to enhance democratic
processes during the upcoming election in 2018. SEOM will further provide support
and oversight during elections in 2019 in six Member States namely the Republics of
Botswana, Malawi, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia and South Africa.

(13).

To further enhance the strategic context for consolidation of democracy in the region,
two policy documents governing democratic elections, namely, the SEAC Strategy for
the Prevention of Electoral-related Conflicts and the SADC Reference Manual on
Election Observation were endorsed by the Ministerial Committee of the Organ. In
addition, the SADC Curriculum and Training Manual on Election Observation was
finalised.

Economic Activity

(14).

According to the IMF World Economic Outlook Report of April 2018, global output in
2017 increased by 3.8 per cent compared to a growth of 3.2 per cent in 2016. This
was on the back of upswings in global investment and trade supported by favorable
financial conditions. Two-thirds of countries, accounting for about three-quarters of
global output, experienced faster growth in 2017 than in the previous year, the highest
share of countries experiencing a year-over-year growth pickup since 2010. Advanced
countries in Europe and Asia grew more than expected.

(15).

Emerging and developing Asia, which accounts for over half of the world growth, grew
by 6.5 per cent in 2017 on the back of increased manufacturing. Output in China
increased by 6.9 per cent in 2017, a 0.7 percentage point increase from 6.7 per cent
growth in 2016. Output growth in India moderated from 7.1 per cent in 2016 to 6.7 per
cent in 2017.

(16).

Growth in Sub-Saharan Africa picked up from 1.4 per cent in 2016 to 2.8 per cent in
2017. However, economic outcomes are far from uniform in Sub-Saharan Africa. Oil
exporters are still dealing with the legacy of the largest real oil price decline since
1970; debt levels are rising in some countries; and other countries are suffering from
internal conflicts.

2.2.1.2
(17).

Developments in Commodity Prices
Commodity prices continued to strengthen in 2017. Broad-based price increases were
supported by both demand and supply factors. Accelerating global growth lifted
demand for commodities, while a number of commodities faced supply constraints.
Oil and precious metals, concerns about mounting geopolitical risk influenced prices
(see Fig 1). Continued OPEC and non-OPEC oil production restraint; measures by
China to reduce polluting metals and energy production; and lower grain planting
intentions in the United States, partly contributed to the current commodity price
trends. Several newly enacted or prospective policy actions have contributed to sharp
movements in metal prices (e.g. U.S. import tariffs on aluminum and steel; U.S.
sanctions on Russian commodity producers, etc).

(18).

2.2.2

According to the World Bank Commodity Prices Index, the increase in commodity
prices is largely driven by energy and metal categories. Energy prices increased by
23.6 per cent in 2017 compared to a decline of 15.2 per cent in 2016. Prices of metals
increased by 24.2 per cent in 2017 compared to a decline of 5.9 per cent in 2016.
However, despite the rise in prices, commodity prices remain below the 2008-09
financial crisis and 2011 peak levels.
Regional Economic Performance

(19).

Available data provided by Member States in April 2018 and from the IMF World
Economic Outlook database indicate that for the past six years, economic growth has
slowed down and remains low across the region. This has affected other sectors
including the financial sector as indicated by rising non-performing loans.

(20).

While inflation has slowed down in general, it remains high with some Member States
still in the double digit levels. Weak exchange rates and the aftermath impacts of
weather-related factors including drought of 2015-26 continued to influence price
movements in some of the Member States.

(21).

In the fiscal sector, public revenues have remained low and in some instances
declining in the face of increasing public expenditures. In some Member States wage
bills have been driving expenditures and accounting for a significant percentage of
public expenditure. Some Member States have introduced (or contemplating to
introduce) minimum wages as an income redistributive mechanism. These factors
have partly contributed to deteriorating fiscal positions of Member States.

11

-----------------------Page 18 End-----------------------

2.2.2.1

Real GDP

(22).

Growth in real GDP remained subdued at a rate of increase of 1.9 percent in 2017
compared to a growth increase of 1.4 percent in 2016. Only Tanzania recorded real
GDP growth rates above the regional target of 7 per cent. The marginal increase in
real GDP was supported by generally favourable weather conditions in most parts of
the region including improvements in commodity prices and improved global
economic recovery. However, weak investment and business confidence weighed on
the downside.

(23).

Consequently, per capita GDP (nominal US Dollar) improved by 11.2 per cent in 2017
compared to a decline of 1.5 per cent recorded in 2016. All Member States except for
DRC recorded positive growth in per capita GDP in 2017, an improvement from only
five Member States (Botswana, DRC, Mauritius, Seychelles and Tanzania) recording
positive growth in 2016.

2.2.2.2
(24).

Inflation
Inflation eased in 2017 although cost-push factors largely driven by weakening
currencies and impact of weather-related factors of 2015-16 continued to influence
prices. Provisional figures indicate that the region recorded an average inflation rate
of 10.7 per cent in 2017 compared to an average of 11.1 per cent in 2016 (see Fig 2).
In 2016 all Member States except for Angola, Malawi, Mozambique, Eswatini and
Zambia met the regional inflation target range of 3-7 per cent. In 2017, all Member
States except for Angola, DRC, Madagascar, Malawi and Mozambique met the
regional inflation target range of 3-7 per cent.

National Savings and Investments
The declining trend in both average total investments and gross national savings
registered since 2014 was reversed in 2017. The region recorded total investments
of 24.4 per cent of GDP in 2017, an improvement from an average of 21.4 per cent of
GDP in 2016. A total of four Member States: Lesotho, Mozambique, Seychelles and
Zambia, managed to achieve the regional target of 30 per cent of GDP for investment
(see Fig 3). This compares to three Member States: Mozambique, Seychelles and
Zambia that met the regional target in 2016.

On the savings side, the region recorded an average gross national savings of 20.6
per cent of GDP in 2017. This was higher than the gross national savings of 14.4 per
cent of GDP realised in 2016. Only Botswana and Zambia achieved the regional
savings target of 30 per cent of GDP in 2017.
Fiscal Sector
Subdued economic performance continued to affect government revenue collections,
in turn affecting fiscal balance positions in the face of increased expenditure needs
(see Fig 4). The region is estimated to have recorded a fiscal deficit of 4.7 per cent of
GDP in 2017, same level recorded in 2016. Only three Member States (DRC,
Seychelles and Tanzania) met the regional fiscal deficit target of 3 per cent of GDP in
2017 compared to five Member States (Angola, Botswana, DRC, Madagascar and
Seychelles) that met the target in 2016.

2.2.2.5

Public debt continues to rise almost across all Member States. The region is estimated
to have recorded a public debt of 50.7 per cent of GDP in 2017 compared to an
average of 49.5 per cent of GDP recorded in 2016. All Member States except Angola,
Mauritius, Mozambique, Seychelles and Zimbabwe met the regional target of public
debt of 60 per cent of GDP, while all Member States except Mauritius, Mozambique,
Seychelles, Zambia and Zimbabwe met the regional fiscal target in 2016.
External Sector

(29).

Despite improvements in commodity prices on the international market, terms of trade
for the region deteriorated by 0.9 per cent in 2017 compared to an improvement of
1.2 per cent in 2016. Export volumes improved marginally by 0.8 per cent in 2017
compared to an increase of 2.9 per cent recorded in 2016. For a third consecutive
year since 2015, import volumes declined by 1.8 per cent in 2017.

(30).

The current account deficit for the region averaged 3.4 per cent of GDP in 2017, an
improvement from an average deficit of 7.5 per cent of GDP in 2016. All Member
States except for Botswana, Malawi, Mozambique, Seychelles and Eswatini recorded
current account deficits within the regional target of 9 per cent of GDP in 2017. In
2016 all Member States except for Botswana, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia and
Seychelles recorded current account deficits within the regional target (see Fig 5).

In terms of foreign exchange reserves, SADC average import cover remained below
the regional target of 6 months of imports at 4.5 months of imports in 2017. This is
slightly below the 4.7 months of imports recorded in 2016. Botswana remained the
only Member State in the region with largest levels of international reserves, followed
by Mauritius and Angola. The rest of the Member States did not meet the criterion of
6 months of import cover, with some of them falling short of the IMF benchmark of 3
months of import cover.
Business Environment

(32).

Data from the World Bank Ease of Doing Business 2016-17 indicate that the SADC
region is making progress in improving the business environment and its
competitiveness in general although performance during the year under review was
mixed. About half of the Member States slipped in ranking while some showed steady
improvements in the ease of doing business ranking.

(33).

Performance with regard to ease of doing business indicate that Angola, DRC,
Madagascar, Malawi, Mauritius, Namibia, Zambia and Zimbabwe improved in their
ranking with Angola, Zambia, Malawi and Mauritius moving up by twenty-four, twentythree, thirteen and seven positions, respectively. Five Member States (Botswana,
Mauritius, Seychelles, South Africa and Zambia) of SADC are ranked within the first
100 bracket (see Fig 6).

The picture with regard to improving the business environment is the same if one
considers the World Economic Forum Global Competitiveness Index (GCI). The GCI
measures the competitiveness of an economy by considering all factors from basic
factors that enable it to be competitive to factors that make it efficient and innovative
(see Fig 7).

Seven Member States improved in the GCI ranking, namely: Botswana, DRC,
Madagascar, Malawi, Mauritius, Tanzania and Zimbabwe. One Member States
(Madagascar) demonstrated exceptional improvements by moving up seven positions
from 128 in 2016 to 121 in 2017. However, Lesotho, Mozambique, Namibia and South
Africa slipped in the ranking in 2017. Mauritius, South Africa and Botswana remain
the most competitive and top ranked Member States in the region. However, three
Member States (Botswana, Madagascar and Tanzania) have consistently improved
their performance for the past four consecutive years.

Regional Economic Outlook for 2018-19

(36).

The moderate uptick of the global economy and the favourable external environment
in terms of improved commodity prices are expected to support the region’s medium
term economic prospects. However, policy makers have to be decisive in effecting
policy changes to take advantage of the improvements in global economic recovery
and commodity prices. Policy makers should also be forthright in managing risks such
as the rising debt levels and impending elections in some Member States, which
normally are associated with reduced appetite for difficult reforms. While
improvements in oil prices will benefit oil exporting countries, it will result in increased
import bills for oil importing countries, thus weakening the external environment.

(37).

At regional level, erratic and poorly distributed rainfall in 2017-18 season will likely
reduce the 2018 summer agricultural production in the region with negative
consequences on food security and food prices. The expected low production may
also affect supply of agro-related raw materials for agro-processing industry.

(38).

In view of the above, world output growth is projected at 3.9 per cent in 2018. Growth
in advanced economies in 2018 is projected to improve marginally to 2.5 per cent and
slowing down to 2.2 per cent in 2019. USA will continue to champion this growth,
growing by 2.9 per cent in 2018 and 2.7 per cent in 2019. Growth in the euro area is
expected to increase by 2.4 per cent in 2018 and slow down to 2.0 per cent in 2019.

(39).

Emerging markets and developing economies will continue to uplift global growth with
their growth as a whole improving from 4.8 per cent in 2017 to 4.9 per cent in 2018,
and 5.1 per cent in 2019. Growth in Brazil is projected to firm up from 1.0 per cent in
2017 to 2.3 per cent in 2018 and 2.5 per cent in 2019. Growth in the SSA is projected
to improve by 0.6 percentage point from 2.8 per cent in 2017 to 3.4 per cent in 2018;
and rising further to 3.7 per cent in 2019.

(40).

Economic growth in the SADC region is expected to increase by an average of 2.5
per cent in 2018, an improvement from 1.9 per cent in 2017. None of the Member
States is projected to achieve the regional target of 7 per cent growth in real GDP in
2018. Per capita GDP for the region is expected to improve modestly from US$4,004
in 2017 to US$4,171 in 2018.

(41).

Savings are projected at an average of 22.2 per cent of GDP in 2018, an improvement
from 21.4 per cent of GDP recorded in 2017. Only Botswana, Mozambique and
Zambia are expected to record gross national savings above the regional target of 30
17

-----------------------Page 24 End-----------------------

per cent of GDP. As for total investment, the region is expected to record a slight
improvement from 24.4 per cent of GDP in 2017 to 25.8 per cent of GDP in 2018, with
five Member States (Botswana, Lesotho, Mozambique, Seychelles, Tanzania and
Zambia) expected to record total investments of above 30 per cent of GDP in 2018.
(42).

Regional inflation is projected to slow down to 8.8 per cent in 2018 from 10.7 per cent
in 2017. All Member States except for Angola, DRC, Malawi and Zambia are expected
to achieve the regional inflation target range of 3-7 per cent in 2018.

(43).

The regional fiscal deficit is expected to improve marginally from 4.7 per cent of GDP
in 2017 to 3.9 per cent of GDP in 2018. A total of seven Member States (Angola.
Botswana, DRC, Madagascar, Malawi, Seychelles and Zimbabwe) are expected to
meet the regional target of fiscal deficit of less than 3 per cent of GDP. Average public
debt for the region is projected to deteriorate further to 52.6 per cent of GDP in 2018
from 50.7 per cent of GDP in 2017. All Member States are expected to record public
debts below 60 per cent of GDP except for Angola, Mozambique, Zambia and
Zimbabwe.

(44).

In the external sector, the region’s terms of trade are projected to improve by 1.7 per
cent in 2018. Imports volumes of goods and services for the region are expected to
increase by 7.0 per cent in 2018, which is an improvement compared to a decline of
1.8 per cent in 2017. In terms of exports volumes, the region is expected to record an
increase of 5.7 per cent in 2018 compared to an increase of 0.8 per cent in 2017. The
current account balance is projected at 3.9 per cent of GDP in 2018 compared to a
deficit of 3.4 per cent of GDP in 2017. All Member States except for Lesotho,
Mozambique and Seychelles are projected to record current account deficit below 9
per cent of GDP. The region is expected to record external reserves of 4.4 months of
imports in 2018, same level as recorded in 2017. Three Member States (Angola,
Botswana and Mauritius) are projected to record external reserves above the regional
target of 6 months import cover.

Industrial Development

3.1.1.1

Popularisation of the SADC Industrialization Strategy and Roadmap (SISR)

(1).

Industrial development remains the core for the integration agenda of SADC and central
to the diversification of the regional economic growth. In 2017/18, popularization of the
Industrial Strategy and Roadmap (SISR) remained the central implementation area in
line with August 2015 Council Decision which urged all Member States to popularize the
Strategy. In this regard, the following achievements were noted:

The Secretariat received requests for determining national indicative public
coordination costs for the Costed Action Plan from 13 Member States of which 8
(Angola, Botswana, Madagascar, South Africa, Eswatini, Lesotho, Namibia and
Zimbabwe) were assisted on Action Plan costing. The DRC and Malawi undertook
own costing exercise and shared their estimates.

x.

Awareness and corporate materials were distributed during Council and Summit
meetings in August 2017, in South Africa. The approach extended outreach and
awareness through 25 Journalists from Angola, Botswana, Democratic Republic
of Congo, Lesotho, Malawi, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa,
Eswatini, Zambia and Zimbabwe.

xi.

Commemoration of the 2nd SADC Industrialization Week was held in July 2017 to
build common understanding on the implementation modalities of the Costed
Action Plan of the Industrialization Strategy. The key outcome of the week was
the Sunninghill Declaration by the private sector in terms of key actions and
reforms to support industrialization.

Development of the Regional Mining Vision
Development of a draft SADC Regional Mining Vision (RMV) and Action Plan in
collaboration with the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA) marked
another milestone in 2017/18. The SADC RMV is aimed at i) maximising the
developmental impact of mineral resources extraction within the overarching context of
the African Mining Vision (AMV); and ii) providing the high level framework to guide
increased minerals beneficiation as outlined in the Industrialization Strategy. A regional
stakeholders meeting will be conducted in September 2018 to consider Member States’
input to the Draft Report and Action Plan.
Resource mobilisation to implement key priorities of the SISR
Continuous efforts were undertaken towards resources mobilisation and bridging of
funding gap for implementation of the key SISR priorities. In 2017/8, the Secretariat
managed to secure resources from the German Development Cooperation (GIZ) and the
European Commission to support the development of regional value chains and value
addition for agricultural and non-agricultural products in selected Agro processing and
Pharmaceuticals sub sectors. Implementation will commence next year.
Creation of the Industrial Development and Trade Directorate
The Industrial Development and Trade Directorate (IDT) was newly established within
the SADC Secretariat structure in 2017/18 with a mandate to ensure that the SADC
Region is self-sufficient in goods and services that can be traded within the region and
across the world. The mandate encompasses the whole chain of activities beginning at
product inception with Scientific Research and Development; to industrial value chain
production and setting of the specification of the goods and services in standards and
technical regulations; which ultimately leads to trade. During the year under review, IDT
focused on the following:
19

-----------------------Page 26 End-----------------------

i.

Implementation of the Industrialization Strategy to diversify the industrial structure of
the SADC economies and promotion of beneficiation, value addition, and value chain
strategies; and

ii.

Effective integration of goods and services markets and widening export opportunities
through new regional, Tripartite and Continental trading arrangements and
enhancement of the trading environment by continuous effort to remove restrictions or
barriers to trade.

3.1.2

Market Integration

3.1.2.1

SADC Free Trade Agreement

(5).

The Secretariat continued to monitor the implementation of the SADC FTA by Member
States. A key milestone in the consolidation of the SADC Free Trade Area during
2017/18 was the implementation of tariff phase down. All parties to the SADC Protocol
on Trade, except for two Member States currently facing implementation challenges,
have completed or are on track to complete tariff reductions. However, the persisting
trend of Member States failing to adhere to the Protocol requirements on customs duty
phase out needs to be addressed by the relevant bodies or escalated to Council as it
risks undermining the foundation of market integration in SADC.

(6).

Progress was made in the review of Regional Cooperation Framework on Competition
Laws and Policies, which is a significant step towards implementation of SADC FTA. In
particular, the following key meetings were undertaken:
i.

The African Competition Forum (ACF), which supports competition policy
development and implementation in the African continent held in December 2017 and
came up with decisions relating to competition laws and policies. Several competition
agencies from Africa benefitted from the capacity building workshop as they learnt new
investigative and analytical skills and shared competition law enforcement
experiences;

ii.

The SADC annual Technical Competition Committee meeting was held in May 2017
and it discussed and shared SADC best practices on competition policy
implementation. The Committee established a fourth working group to spearhead work
on consumer issues; and

iii.

The second SADC Cartel Working Group Meeting in August 2017 in Zambia to discuss
and share cartel enforcement practices and common challenges.

3.1.2.2
(7).

Trade in Services liberalisation
The SADC Protocol on Trade in Services, which was signed in August 2012, continued
to provide a framework for Member States to negotiate the progressive liberalisation of
trade in services in identified sectors. The first round of these negotiations, which
commenced in 2012 and covered six priority sectors, has culminated in achievement of
the following milestones:
20

-----------------------Page 27 End-----------------------

i.

An agreement on four (4) sectors namely Financial, Tourism, Transport and
Communication services which resulted in the finalisation of negotiations on fourteen
(14) offers (in the form of lists of commitments) as well as six regulatory Annexes
covering Financial Services, Telecommunication Services, Tourism Services,
Substantial Business Operations, Movement of Natural Persons (Mode 4), and interim
arrangements relating to Commitments on Subsidies; and

ii.

Negotiations on regulatory Annexes covering Postal and Courier Services, and
Transport and Logistics Services are still continuing. Negotiations on offers in the other
two sectors namely Construction and Energy-Related Services, will continue in the
next round of the trade in services liberalisation schedule, which is expected to include
new sectors in support of the industrialization strategy.

3.1.2.3

Proposals on the Trade Related Facility (TRF) submitted by Member States
and approved and implemented

(8).

All project proposals on the TRF from beneficiary Member States were approved by May
2017 and all beneficiary Member States signed the Financing Agreements by 27 July
2017. This marked a significant achievement in that approved projects largely reflect
SADC integration priorities, with most TRF interventions targeting industrial development
and enhanced market integration.

(9).

A 30% payment advance was issued to all 12 Member states for project implementation
in Botswana (Euro 780,000, Lesotho (Euro 780,000), Malawi (Euro 420,000),
Madagascar (Euro 420,000), Mauritius (Euro 420,000), Mozambique (Euro 780,000)
Namibia (Euro 780,000), Seychelles (Euro 420,000), Eswatini (Euro 780,000) Tanzania
(Euro 420,000), Zambia (Euro 420,000) and Zimbabwe (Euro 420,000). Procurement
and Financial management capacity building was provided to all Member States and
Work and Procurement Plans were facilitated for all beneficiary countries.

Tripartite Free Trade Area
Tripartite Member/Partner States have continued with work to finalise negotiations on
outstanding Phase 1 issues, mainly on tariff offers, specific rules of origin and trade
remedies. To date, twenty-two (22) Tripartite Member/Partner States have signed the
Agreement, with only three (3) ratifications received so far from Egypt, Kenya and
Uganda. Progress in the TFTA has been hampered by lack of funding, and the rapid
advance in the negotiations for the African Continental Free Trade Area, which has not
faced the same financial challenges. In an effort to get more ratifications of the
Agreement, the Tripartite Task Force (TTF) has received funding from the EU to
undertake national awareness workshops in selected Tripartite Member/Partner States.
A total of fourteen (14) ratifications are required for the Agreement to enter into force.

-----------------------Page 28 End-----------------------

(11).

The Agreement Establishing the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) and its
Protocols on Trade in Goods; Trade in Services; and Rules and Procedures on the
Settlement of Disputes were adopted by the Assembly of Heads of State and
Government, at its 10th Extra-Ordinary Session held in Kigali, Rwanda on 21st March
2018. Forty-four (44) African countries, of which nine (9) are SADC Member States,
signed the AfCFTA whilst twenty-seven (27) countries signed the Protocol on the Free
Movement of Persons. Following the signing, 22 ratifications will be needed for the
Agreement to come into force.

(12).

Kenya, Ghana and Rwanda became the first countries to present their instruments of
ratification in May 2018 and more are expected as internal legal processes unfold in
respective Member States in the course of this year. Work is continuing to facilitate the
conclusion of the outstanding issues (Built-In Agenda) in Phase I in the next AU
Assembly Meeting in January 2019.

Trade Facilitation and Customs instruments
In pursuing the implementation of the SADC Trade Facilitation Programme (TFP)
approved by the Ministerial Task Force on Regional Economic Integration in July 2016,
which was meant to support the implementation of the industrialization strategy and
roadmap. During the 2017/18, major activities on customs and trade facilitation include:
i.

Development of a Simplified Trade Regime (STR) in the region aimed at reducing
barriers to trade, which affect small traders, particularly the transaction costs,
associated with formal trade; and

ii.

Introduction of the E-certificate of origin aimed at determining whether a product
originates in the region and therefore benefits from duty free access to SADC
market. A set of rules for the E-certificate of Origin aimed to benefit Member
States on SADC Trade preferences were agreed upon by Member States.
Transition from the current manual certification mostly issued by Customs
Administrators in most Member States to electronic platform in exporting or
country of origin is deemed to be an effective and efficient trade facilitation
instrument which could reduce cost and time while promoting transparency and
e-filing; and

iii.

A project proposal on trade facilitation needs for Kasumbalesa border post, which
is part of the North-South Corridor border management improvement was
approved by the German Government and presented to DRC stakeholders lead
by the Ministry of Trade, and the Zambian Stakeholders lead by the Ministry of
Trade and Commerce.

Financial Market Integration
SADC continues to support the modernization and harmonization of payments and
clearing systems as a means of financing priority sectors and driving economic
development in the region. SADC Integrated Regional Electronic Settlement System
(SIRESS) made further progress and consolidation since July 2013 when the system
went live. As at end of April 2018, SIRESS had achieved the following milestones:
22

-----------------------Page 29 End-----------------------

(15).

3.1.2.8

i.

Settled a cumulative total number of 1,063,306 transactions representing ZAR
4.46 trillion, equivalent of USD 377.14 billion. All fourteen Member States were
participating in SIRESS with exception of Madagascar; and

ii.

Facilitated move from single currency settlement system (South African rand
settlement) into a multicurrency settlement system with the United States Dollar
as the additional currency of settlement. Settlement in US Dollar in the system is
expected to go live in October 2018 while the whole multi-currency system is
expected to be fully implemented by December 2019.

Furthermore, in order to be an inclusive payment system, SIRESS can now also settle
low value payments starting in the four Common Monetary Authorities countries of
Lesotho, Namibia, Eswatini and South Africa. In order to prevent a challenge or hijacking
of the SIRESS trademark to a third party, work on the registration of SIRESS trademark
in all Member States is underway. However, since there were some trademarks, which
were already registered and which were phonetically and visually similar to the proposed
SIRESS trademark, it has been agreed that the SADC payment system be registered as
“SADC Real Time Gross Settlement System” (SADC-RTGS).
Development Finance

(16).

SADC Project Preparation Development Facility (SADC - PPDF) continues to support
Member States to strengthen regional infrastructure connectivity by providing grants for
project preparation and development for cross-border regional infrastructure projects.
During 2017/18, two additional projects namely the Africa Green Co project (Zambia,
Botswana, Mozambique and Namibia) and the Renewable Energy Agency Guidelines
and Standards (Mauritius) were approved. The cumulative number of projects financed
under this Facility was nine projects by June 2018.

(17).

The Secretariat has been able to mobilise additional resources under SADCGerman/KfW Cooperation to fund additional project preparation activities. The German
government has undertaken to provide additional resources through KfW to fund the
PPDF activities depending on the evaluation of the Facility, which is currently underway.

(18).

Work on the operationalisation of the SADC Regional Development Fund is ongoing.
The Secretariat has engaged with the AfDB to provide technical support in the
operationalization of Infrastructure Development and Industrial Development windows;
Development of a migration plan for the current PPDF into the SADC Regional
Development Fund and development of the Fund’s operational and governance
guidelines and policies.

3.1.2.9

Investment and Tax Related Matters
SADC solicited assistance from the OECD to develop a SADC Investment Policy
Framework (based on OECD Policy on Investment Framework) in response to the
challenges of attracting foreign direct investment into the region as well as domestic and
regional investment.
23

-----------------------Page 30 End-----------------------

(20).

The SADC Investment Policy Framework (IPF) was finalized in 2017/18. The IPF is
aimed at providing a framework for the formulation and operationalization of sound
investment policies that can promote broad based economic growth in the region. The
formulation process, which took over two years to finish was driven by Member States
and was designed as an action-oriented programme that provided a policy roadmap. The
aim was to leverage a collective effort among Member States to advance reforms that
can be supportive to attracting investment. National Action Plans on Investment (NAPI)
are being developed to provide policy guidance on the implementation of the SADC IPF.
Three Member States have developed their NAPIs with the assistance of the USAID
Investment and Trade Hub in Botswana, Malawi and Zambia.

(21).

The Bilateral Investment Treaties (BITs) Template, which was first developed in 2012
was reviewed during the year to reflect the dynamic nature of international agreements
in a changing environment. The Template provides advice to governments that they may
consider in any negotiations they enter into relating to investment treaties. It also
provides a learning resource for officials and may serve as the basis of training for SADC
government officials, particularly those that are involved in the negotiation of investment
treaties.

(22).

The SADC Model Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (DTAA) has been revised to
take into account issues of Base Erosion and Profit Shifting. The revised model was
approved by the Ministers of Finance and Investment at their meeting in July 2018 .The
Ministers directed the Tax Subcommittee to assess the status of harmonisation of tax
regimes in the region and report progress at the next meeting.

3.1.2.10

Macroeconomic Convergence Programme

(23).

The Macroeconomic Convergence peer review process was launched in May 2013 in
Maputo, Mozambique. Since then, all Member States except Madagascar and
Seychelles have been peer reviewed. In 2017/18, five Member States namely Botswana,
Mauritius, Mozambique, South Africa and Zambia were peer reviewed and the findings
were considered by the Peer Review Panel in July 2018. The Panel approved
recommended policy proposals for these Member States as presented by the respective
Review Teams and encouraged the reviewed Members States to implement the
recommendations thereof and report progress on an annual basis.

(24).

With regard to performance of Member States against the set macroeconomic
convergence targets, performance has been mixed in 2017-18. In 2017, all Member
States except for Angola, DRC, Madagascar, Malawi and Mozambique met the regional
inflation target range of 3-7 per cent. In 2016 all Member States except for Angola,
Malawi, Mozambique, Eswatini and Zambia met the regional inflation target range of 37%. Only three Member States (DRC, Seychelles and Tanzania) met the regional fiscal
deficit target of 3% of GDP in 2017 compared to five Member States (Angola, Botswana,
DRC, Madagascar and Seychelles) that met the target in 2016. All Member States except
for Angola, Mauritius, Mozambique, Seychelles and Zimbabwe met the regional target
of public debt of 60 per cent of GDP.

Roll Out of the Regional Infrastructure Development Master Plan

(25).

The SADC Regional Infrastructure Development Master Plan (RIDMP) is the blueprint
for all the infrastructure projects for the period 2012 to 2027. It implements Priority B –
Infrastructure Support for regional integration of the Revised RISDP. The RIDMP focuses
on the realisation of SADC Infrastructure Vision 2027 and contributes towards the
Industrialisation Strategy and Roadmap as well as other regional strategic frameworks.
To this end, a number of project preparation facilities, are in place to ensure that the
Region has in place a healthy pipeline of bankable projects. These include:
i.

The SADC Project Preparation and Development Facility (PPDF) hosted by the
Development Bank of Southern Africa in Midrand, South Africa (USD25 million);

ii.

The Southern African Power Pool (SAPP) Project Advisory Unit (PAU) hosted by
the Southern African Power Pool Coordination Centre in Harare, Zimbabwe
funded by the World Bank (US$ 30 Million);

3.2.2.1

Implementation of SADC Roaming Project

(26).

Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) from nine (9) SADC Member States are implementing
the SADC Home and Away Roaming (SHAR) project using the Roam Like at Home
(RLAH) principle. This is in line with the November 2014 decision of Ministers responsible
for ICT, to adopt the Roam Like At Home regime by regulating both the wholesale and
retail-roaming tariff using the glide paths for the next six (6) years. The Project is being
implemented in three Phases: Phase I: Transparency to Roaming Tariff and Increase in
Roaming Footprint; Phase II: Wholesale and Retail Price Cap Regulation, Three Route
Approach; and Phase III: Cost–based Roaming Price Regulation.

25

-----------------------Page 32 End-----------------------

(27).

3.2.2.2
(28).

The 9 Member States have implemented Phases 1 and 2, which has brought about
transparency on Roaming Services through the reception of an SMS upon entry of a
roamer into a foreign network and reduction in tariffs. The second Phase was
implemented on a reciprocal basis through price cap regulation for both wholesale and
retail roaming prices, following the SADC Roaming Glide Paths. The third and last phase
requires the development of a SADC Roaming Cost Model in order to determine the true
cost of roaming in SADC to be implemented by September 2018.
SADC Declaration on the Fourth Industrial Revolution
In September 2017 in South Africa, as a commitment by the Member States, the SADC
ICT Ministers signed a Declaration on the Fourth Industrial Revolution (FIR) to guide the
development of regional programmes and projects. The Declaration is a commitment in
preparing SADC for the Fourth Industrial Revolution through the use of ICTs, and the
need to accelerate the roll out of Broadband Infrastructure and treat Internet as an
essential tool to be accessed by all SADC Citizens. The key priority areas:
i.
ii.
iii.
iv.
v.

(29).

The Declaration promises to drive collaboration and introduce concrete and practical
measures to position SADC as a competitive and critical player in the development and
evolution of the Fourth Industrial Revolution throughout its value chains in the following
priority areas:
i.
ii.
iii.
iv.
v.

vulnerable groups; and
Pursue other critical enablers of the Fourth Industrial Revolution.

The SADC Secretariat has set up the SADC FIR Task Team to develop a framework to
operationalize the SADC Declaration on the FIR.
Energy
In 2017/2018, the Region commissioned 3,580 MW in 2017 contributed by ten (10)
mainland Member States: Angola 1,727 MW; Botswana 120 MW; DRC 150 MW; Malawi
6 MW; Mozambique 40 MW; Namibia 70 MW; South Africa 1,234 MW; Tanzania 28 MW;
Zambia 55 MW and Zimbabwe 150 MW. The total installed capacity is 67,200MW. The
power plant projects were commissioned by both Public Utilities and Independent Power
Producers (IPPs). A Project Definition Readiness Assessment (PDRA) has been
developed as a project management and monitoring tool for project tracking to ensure
26

-----------------------Page 33 End-----------------------

accuracy of reporting progress. The tool was disseminated in all mainland SADC
Member States to sensitize national power utilities under SAPP.

(33).

Electricity generation and transmission expansion plan implemented
The current peak demand and generation capacity reserve margins reveal an excess
Regional capacity of 2,957 MW. Moreover, commissioned capacity of conventional and
pumped hydropower storage in 2017/2018 occupied 43%, gas 24%, solar systems
(Photovoltaics (PV) and Concentrated Solar Power (CSP)) 11%, wind 10% and coal
occupied only 7%. The recent investments in the renewable energy technologies and
commissioned gas-fired power plants increased a share of other primary energy sources
in the generation mix. As a result, the share of coal dropped from 74% to 60% between
2013 and 2017 while hydropower remained constant at 21%.
Regional Petroleum and Gas sub-programme developed and Implemented
The SADC Secretariat convened a SADC Petroleum and Gas Subcommittee meeting
on 15-16 February 2018 to, among others, establish a regional gas committee in
response to the directive from the 36th Ministerial Meeting in Ezuluini Valley in Eswatini
in July 2017 and the 37 th Summit of Heads of States in 2017 which both put emphasis
on the importance of the role of petroleum and gas in the regional energy mix and the
need to develop gas economy. The Subcommittee prepared draft TORs for the regional
Gas Committee. The Committee was inaugurated in the margins of the Energy Ministers
meeting that took place in June 2018. The Regional Gas Committee will also oversee
development of a Regional Gas Masterplan.

The Tripartite Transport and Transit Facilitation Programme (TTTFP) was launched in
October 2017 in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania to facilitate the development of a more
competitive, integrated and liberalized regional road transport market that can effectively
contribute to regional integration and economic development, through development and
implementation of harmonized road transport policies, laws, regulations, standards for
efficient cross-border road transport and transit networks, transport and logistics
services, systems and procedures in the East Africa-Southern Africa (EA-SA) region. To
date the Programme has achieved the following notable milestones:
i.

Development and validation of Vehicle Load Management Agreement;
Multilateral Cross Border Road Transport Agreement; and five model laws to
guide domestication of the agreements at Member States level;

ii.

National and regional sensitization was conducted in 17 of the 21 Tripartite
Member/Partner States to identify technical assistance requirements from
Member States and key stakeholders;

iii.

North-South Corridor (NSC) Rail Project

(35).

In June 2016 grant funding was secured by the NEPAD Business Foundation from the
SADC Project Preparation Development Facility (PPDF) managed by the Development
Bank of Southern Africa (DBSA) for the NSC study, and the technical consultant was
appointed in February 2017 to undertake the study. The NEPAD Business Foundation
successfully facilitated development and agreement of key proposals between the NSC
Railways for development of the NSC. On 25 January 2018, a NSC Steering Committee
meeting consisting of Chief Executive Officers (CEOs) of all the NSC railways was
convened and the findings of the NSC Study were approved.

(36).

Through the NSC study, the NSC railways have collectively agreed on key principles of
the corridor development strategy across all key areas which include: operations,
marketing, infrastructure and rolling stock. The NSC study produced proposals for the
future vision of the corridor, and it also provided immediate action items which all the
railways have agreed to execute. A series of projects were approved for further
development by the CEOs of the NSC Railways.

(37).

In order to execute the above approved projects funding is being sourced for project
preparation, particularly for the immediate term projects. Terms of Reference (TOR) for
the projects have been developed and International Cooperating Parties (ICPs) are being
approached for funding. Other projects are already being executed by the railways such
as the injection of rolling stock into the corridor. Transnet has recently delivered rolling
stock to Zambia and Zimbabwe in Q1 2018 to increase capacity on the railway line. Other
applications will be submitted for the infrastructure, and rolling stock projects during the
course of 2018.

with four (4) technical staff and the Executive Director, in the Institute of Groundwater
Studies, University of Free State. The SADC GMI Financial Sustainability Plan and
Strategy was developed, reviewed and endorsed by the relevant technical committees
including the Sub-committee for Groundwater, and the Water Resources Technical
Committee, and approved by the Committee of Ministers responsible for Water at their
meeting in June 2018. Consultancies are underway to assess policy and legal
frameworks for groundwater management in Member States and at the regional level,
and the Groundwater Information Portal housing information on groundwater in the
region including SADC groundwater map and atlas has been developed. The Portal is
accessible on line by all Member States. Water experts from Member States have been
trained on groundwater management through support from partners such as UNESCO,
IWMI, Waternet, University of Free State, and University of Botswana etc.
Climate Resilient Infrastructure Development Facility (CRIDF) Projects
A number of projects were implemented with the support of CRIDF to promote
community resilience in terms of water supply, food security through irrigation and other
livelihoods initiatives. Successfully completed projects include:
i.

Mitema Boreholes Rehabilitation, Makonde Plateau Water Supply and Sanitation
Authority in Tanzania: and rehabilitation of Mitema wellfield including installation
of new pumps for a water treatment plant serving 350,000 beneficiaries. The USD
300,000 works were commissioned in November 2017;

3.2.6.2

(43).

The Southern African Regional Climate Outlook Forum (SARCOF) products were
released on 26 August 2017 for the 2017/18 rainy season based on the La Niña trend,
which is typically used to bring above average rainfall to Southern Africa. However, sea
surface temperature patterns in the Indian Ocean and Atlantic Ocean had interfered and
reduced the likelihood of widespread La Nina like-impact on the summer rainfall patterns
over SADC region. The presence of a weak La Nina enhanced the expected normal
weather patterns over the region. However, other regional systems such as the Midtropospheric Botswana High and Tropical Cyclones also influenced the prolonged dry
spells and maximum temperature within the Region. SADC Climate Services Centre
continually releases the updates on the SARCOF products on monthly basis.
Capacity of Member States experts to generate and disseminate climate
outputs strengthened
In 2017, delegates from 14 Member States from the SADC National
Meteorological/Hydrological Services were capacitated on how to produce national
rainfall forecast and contribute to the SADC regional consensus rainfall forecasts for
30

-----------------------Page 37 End-----------------------

October 2017-to-March 2018. Sixty end-users participated at SARCOF and received
guidance on the use of the probability forecast. Three working groups (Agriculture, Water
and Energy and Disaster Risk Reduction) were formed to review the forecast and agree
on the way forward on the use of seasonal forecast.

Monitoring for Environment and Security in Africa
The Monitoring for Environment and Security in Africa (MESA) Project was successfully
implemented and completed in September 2017. The project focused on promoting the
use of Satellite Earth Observation (EO) to strengthen the capacity in government
departments with an existing mandate to monitor and provide early warning information
for agriculture, drought, wildfire and flood and to promote use of Earth Observation in
planning, implementation of programme and policy-making process. More than 300
national officers in SADC Member States participated in the MESA national and regional
training programmes. At the end of project in September 2017, 94% of the agriculture,
drought and wildfire product lines were operational.

(46).

An Electoral Technical Committee comprising of members of SADC Electoral Advisory
Council (SEAC) and the Electoral Commissions Forum of SADC Countries (ECF-SADC)
was commissioned by the 2017 SADC Summit to conduct a pre-election assessment
Mission to the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The Summit tasked the Committee
to assess the electoral administration capacity and technical needs of the National
Independent Electoral Commission (CENI) ahead of the country’s anticipated national
elections. The Mission achieved the following:
i.

Assessed the political and security environment in the DRC; and constitutional
and legal framework governing the electoral process of the country;

ii.

Conducted a needs assessment of the capacity and electoral technical needs of
CENI upon which’ the DRC request for electoral support from SADC Member
States was based;

iii.

Investigated challenges faced by CENI in preparing for the elections;

iv.

Analysed the potential factors for election related violence and alternative dispute
resolution mechanisms available; and

v.

Identified the electoral assistance required by CENI to administer the country’s
electoral process.

SEAC engaged stakeholders on the various inter-related issues in Zimbabwe in March
2018 following the Military assisted transition of November, 2017. In this regard, SEAC
also sought to establish the needs for the Member State in respect of Electoral
assistance and mediation strategies before, during and post the 2018 election phases.
31

-----------------------Page 38 End-----------------------

(47).

SEAC members from South Africa, Malawi, Eswatini, DRC, and Zambia were
capacitated with skills to be informed advisors, facilitators and enablers of national and
regional mediation efforts, that can accompany the long-term resolution of the underlying
root causes of conflict in the varied contexts across the SADC Region. This included
skills on tools for analyses of the causes and patterns of election-related conflicts, conflict
tracking, and mainstreaming conflict prevention strategies throughout the electoral cycle.

(48).

Training modalities using the new curriculum for Short Term Observers (STOs) and Long
Term Observers (LTOs) were finalised with the Electoral Institute for a Sustainable
Democracy in Africa (EISA), including the acquisition of Tablets and Software. The use
of the technology will for the first time, enable SEOMs to report on electoral processes
in real time, thereby greatly improving the processing of information, as well as
enhancing the quantitative and qualitative analysis of elections and their outcomes.

(49).

The Mediation Support Unit (MSU) accelerated its capacity building interventions aimed
at deepening regional capability to prevent and manage conflict, through trainings that
covered negotiation, conflict tracking and analysis; mediation skills and approaches and;
gender mainstreaming within the context of conflict prevention and response:
i.

To date, 395 Member State and civil society experts, were trained in mediation
skills and practice. The MSU has also trained rostered experts from the regional
African Standby Capacity Roster, who are ready for deployment to support Peace
Support Operations and other conflict resolution missions in various capacities.
This strategic, focused and targeted training has contributed to the region’s
overall readiness to respond to conflict situations;

ii.

Working through their established strategic partnerships, the Unit also facilitated
the finalization and approval of the SADC Regional Strategy on Women, Peace
and Security (WPS), a key policy tool to support the implementation of UN
Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 1325 in the region. In furtherance of this
work, the MSU is working with the Office of the AU’s Special Envoy on Women
Peace and Security to continuously assess the implementation of UNSCR 1325
and the WPS Agenda through the roll out of the Continental Results Framework
on WPS. In addition to collaborations at the regional and continental levels, the
MSU has also been working with the UN’s MSU at the global level to mutually
enhance capacity through peer exchange, experience sharing and lessons-learnt
initiatives. This is a continuation of the Unit’s strategic relationship with UNDPA
and other relevant UN Agencies;

iii.

The MSU provided technical and logistical support services to the SADC
Oversight Committee on the Kingdom of Lesotho, which deployed to Lesotho ten
(10 missions) between April-November 2017 for the purposes of following up on
the implementation of SADC Decisions;

iv.

The Unit assisted in the drafting of the Proposal for the Conduct of the Multi-stakeholder National Political Dialogue, which is currently at the preparatory stage in
Lesotho; and

3.3.2

In October-December 2017 the MSU also provided technical and administrative
support to the thirty-eight (38) member Expanded Oversight Committee, which
was deployed to provide more security related expertise to the regular Oversight
Committee.

Defence and Security

(50).

The strengthening of the region’s capacity for collective Defence and rapid response to
security threats in the region through Peace Support Operations (PSOs), humanitarian
assistance and support to civil authorities continued during the reporting period.
Measures in this regard included, among others: the conduct of a joint International
Conference on the Great Lakes Region (ICGLR) – SADC Double Troika plus Force
Intervention Brigade (FIB) Troop Contributing Countries conduct of a re-assessment
mission in the DRC, in order to re-evaluate the most current security situation and
determine the type of support still required by the Government of the DRC.

(51).

Engagements were done between the SADC and the UN on the urgent need to address
the operational challenges facing the FIB, deployed under the United Nations
Organization Stabilization Mission in the DRC (MONUSCO). The outcome of these
efforts enabled a mutual agreement between the UN and SADC on the strengthening of
the FIB and enabling the Brigade to continue to fulfill its offensive operations mandate
effectively.

(52).

The SADC Preventive Mission in Lesotho (SAPMIL) was deployed to Lesotho in
November 2017 to address the fragile and unpredictable political and security associated
with the assassination of the former Commander of the Lesotho Defence Force (LDF),
Lieutenant General Khoantlhe Motšomotšo. The Mission’s mandate was extended by
the Double Troika Summit to November 2018 to continue to underpin the region’s resolve
to ensure stability.

(53).

The deployment of personnel to the SADC Preventive Mission in Lesotho was
undertaken between 20 and 28 November 2017 and the Official Launch Parade for the
Mission was held on 2 December 2017. As of 1 March 2018, SAPMIL Troop Contributing
Countries (TCCs) had deployed 261 personnel in Lesotho (Military Personnel – 215,
Police Officers – 22, Intelligence Personnel -15 and 9 Civilian Personnel). This
deployment was in line with the recommendations of the Technical Assessment Mission
(TAM) to Lesotho commissioned by the Defence Sector at the extraordinary meeting in
Luanda, Angola in May 2017.

(54).

A number of Defence Decisions on regional strategic defense and policy were reviewed
and adopted during the period under review. These include: (i) Draft MoU between SADC
and the Government of Russian Federation in the Area of Military and technical
Cooperation which was endorsed during the DSC Meeting for submission to the MCO
for adoption; (ii) Cybersecurity was considered in the DSC Meeting as being of regional
dimension and urged for concerted regional action in this regard; (iii) Member States
were urged to continue compilation of their national statistics on poaching, illegal
migration and the proliferation of small arms and light weapons; (iv)and the DSC
mandated the Secretariat to begin fencing of the RLD based on the approved Layout
Plans, and to report progress at the next DSC in 2018.

(55).

3.3.3

Operationalisation of the SADC Regional Logistics Depot (RLD) remains on course, with
Phase I of the construction of the RLD, related to site clearance and fencing, already in
progress and expected to be concluded in August 2018. The Secretariat also completed
the development of the Resource Mobilisation Strategy to fund the RLD Project, whereby
the most suitable option was concluded to be a hybrid Member States and International
Cooperating Partners (ICPs) funding approach. In order to operationalize this option, MS
will be expected to contribute seed capital, while the Secretariat continues to mobilize
remainder resources from ICPs; with the total cost of the construction estimated to be
USD 45 million and the anticipated completion date for the construction tentatively set
for 2021, depending on the availability of funds.
State Security

(56).

In respect of the implementation of the Regional Counter Terrorism Strategy adopted by
the Summit in 2015, Member States are at various stages of establishing national counter
terrorism structures to prevent and respond to terrorism; addressing social and economic
marginalization; enhancing collaboration with other security institutions and local
community; enhancing bilateral and multilateral cooperation to address the scourge of
terrorism; ratifying regional and international conventions on prevention and combatting
terrorism; enacting and reviewing legislation to enhance the prevention and combatting
of terrorism; enhancing border security measures; establishing financial intelligence
centres; enhancing measures to secure air space; initiating awareness activities on the
dangers of terrorism, radicalization and recruitment; strengthening border security
measures; enhancing measures aimed at protecting critical and key structures;
implementing intervention measures against terrorism, radicalization and extremism;
strengthening control of firearms; conducting capacity building training for border and
security officials; and conducting regular joint security operations.

(57).

All the measures being undertaking by Member States are in compliance with the Plan
of Action for the implementation of the Regional Counter Terrorism Strategy.

(59).

Public Security
The Secretariat continued to implement programmes to enhance Cross Border Security,
migration and refugee management. This Security agenda is driven by drafting Policies
and Strategies that address Corruption, Refugees, Migration, Poaching, Prisons and
Border Management. In order to effectively discharge this responsibility, the Sector
consults and deliberately engages with experts in Sub- Sub Sectors so as to inform
Policy. In 2017/2018, with input from its Statutory Committees, the Secretariat drafted
the following key guiding Policies and Frameworks:
Implementation of the African Union Protocol on Free Movement of Persons
The Policy is meant to inform on- going negotiations between the AU Commission and
Regional Economic Communities (RECs) and their Member States on the development
of the African Protocol to the Treaty Establishing the African Economic Community
relating to the Free Movement of Persons, Right of Residence and Right of
Establishment.

3.3.4.4

The Secretariat also carried out a Desktop Review on the implementation of the AU
Migration Policy Framework. The review explored regional efforts on ‘migration and
security’ and ‘migration and development, within the framework of the AU. Although not
comprehensive, it highlighted successes, challenges and proposed recommendations
on implementation of the AU Migration Policy Framework most importantly the need to
develop the SADC Migration Framework.
Draft Protocol on Inter-State Transfer of Foreign Prisoners
The Protocol is meant to foster cooperation between member States in handling and
transferring Prisoners from one country to another and outlines modalities for amongst
others how requests and replies, grounds for transfer, implications of transfer on
Sentencing State, Transit and Costs will be handled.
Draft Regional Policy Framework on Management of Asylum Seekers and
Refugees
The Policy Framework seeks to promote sound management of Asylum Seekers and
Refugees in the Region without compromising Regional Security. Most importantly, it
implores Member States to adopt adequate measures to harmonise their approaches
towards Asylum Seekers and Refugees Management and not deny Asylum Seekers an
opportunity in an arbitrary manner and without just course. In order to foster an effective
regional asylum and refugees’ management process, the framework outlines important
clauses that include: handling of individual applications, handling of family applications,
screening and referral systems, rights and responsibilities of asylum seekers and
refugees and secondary movements, amongst others.
Draft SADC Anti –Corruption Strategic Action Plan 2018-2022

(63).

The Strategic Plan is a step in implementing the 2001 SADC Protocol against Corruption.
The Plan seeks to promote, facilitate and regulate cooperation among Member States to
prevent, detect, punish and eradicate corruption in the public and private sectors; foster
the development and harmonization of policies and domestic legislation of Member
States relating to the prevention, detection, punishment and eradication of corruption in
the public and private sectors.

(64).

In order to deepen the technical expertise of the Public Security Sector, the following two
sub Sub-Committees under the Anti – Corruption portfolio were endorsed:
i.

The Prevention, Policy, Good Governance and Capacity building Sub-sub
Committee whose main role is to develop and advise on anti-corruption policy and
strategy, set the priorities in the prevention of corruption, integrate Corruption
Prevention Strategies, identify regional training needs for Corruption Officials and
Facilitate Regional anti-corruption assessments;

ii.

The Investigation, Prosecution and Civil litigation Sub-sub Committee that is
charged with, amongst others, judicial cooperation and mutual legal assistance in
criminal matters, in particular anti-corruption, among Member States; developing
35

-----------------------Page 42 End-----------------------

a framework for judicial cooperation and mutual legal assistance in criminal
matters, especially on corruption; facilitating cooperation with relevant
international, continental and regional cooperating partners, as well as the private
sector; reviewing and harmonising anti-corruption legislations and policies in the
SADC region; and
iii.

3.3.5

The Public Security Sector is still committed to review the operating hours of
identified Strategic Ports of Entries in order to cater for high traffic volumes and
meet the requirements of trade. Immigration and Customs Officials from time to
time collaborate to identify strategic Border Posts for Harmonisation.

Police

(65).

The Southern African Police Chiefs Cooperation Organisation (SARPCCO) Constitution
and Cooperation Agreement between SADC and INTERPOL was reviewed as part of
SARPCCO harmonisation into SADC structures, the Constitution and Cooperation
Agreement were reviewed in line with amongst others: the SADC Treaty, the Protocol on
Politics, Defence and Security Cooperation.

(66).

The Model law to combat Online Child Sexual Exploitation and Standard Operating
Procedures were developed for Repatriation of Motor Vehicles and SARPCCO Vehicles
Clearance Certificates.

(67).

SARPCCO Legal Sub-Committee, assisted by SADC Secretariat, developed the draft
SADC Regional Guidelines for Crime and Violence Prevention in line with the emerging
best practice in crime and violence prevention;

(68).

A criminal information function was established in the context of the SADC Regional
Early Warning Centre, an officer from INTERPOL RB Harare was also nominated as the
Contact Point to constantly liaise with SADC Regional Early Warning Centre on criminal
information.

(69).

The SARPCCO Joint cross border Operations namely, FARU, USALAMA VI, TEMBO
and BASADE VI was conducted, which produced tangible results related to the recovery
of stolen properties and arrest of a numbers of the illegal migrants.

(70).

The SADC Secretariat supported INTERPOL RB Harare, to strengthen the cooperation
with AFRIPOL and report progress annually at SADC Chiefs of Police Sub-Committee
(CPSC) meetings and establishment of AFRIPOL liaison offices to deliver on the
objectives of the 3 Year Work Plan 2017-2019.

3.3.6
(71).

Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR)
The Secretariat facilitated the consolidation of results from previous interventions and
integrated them into the Regional Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Strategic
Plan and Plan of Action (2016 – 2030) to ensure adequate alignment between DRR
strategic direction for the region and the international, continental and regional
frameworks.
36

-----------------------Page 43 End-----------------------

(72).

A study on the integration of ‘DRR and Climate Change’ was carried out to identify longterm regional changes and trends that affect vulnerabilities and risks, particularly climate
change. The study recognises the levels of vulnerability to disaster risks by different
gender groups due to increased hazard contexts that will generally escalate disaster
risks. The study results will guide the SADC Secretariat in mainstreaming Climate
Change Adaptation in DRR programming.

(73).

The DRR Web-Portal, and the web-based database for DRR inventories were finalised
during the period. The DRR Web-Portal and database are core to the regional disaster
risk reduction information and knowledge management systems; which form critical
ingredients for effective early warning systems and mechanisms.

(74).

A regional DRR Conference was organized with the overall aim to review progress
achieved by the SADC Regional DRR Programme towards the goal of managing
uncertainty, reducing vulnerability and building resilience for SADC Member States and
communities in view of the global and regional frameworks that guide DRR, resilience
and sustainable development. The conference provided a platform for key international
and regional DRR stakeholders to share key DRR and resilience initiatives, projects and
programmes as part of regional DRR sharing of lessons and experience towards shaping
and informing new and upcoming Regional Resilience Programmes aligned to the
Sendai Framework.

(75).

The Secretariat coordinated a peer review in the Republic of Seychelles, that was a
collaborative effort of the Government of Seychelles with support from the Republic of
South Africa. The review team included two peers each from Mozambique, South Africa,
Madagascar, Eswatini and three DRR experts from SADC Secretariat. The Peer Review
contributed to mainstreaming of Disaster Risk Reduction in development plans and
strategies; through Peer learning among Member States.

(76).

Three (3) key DRR capacity building workshops on Transboundary Disaster Risk
Management, Ecosystem Based DRR, Disaster Need Assessment and Civil Military
Coordination in Disaster Response were conducted.

Special Programmes of Regional Dimension

3.4.1

Agriculture, Food Security and Natural Resources

3.4.1.1

Regional Agricultural Policy

(77).

The Region successfully developed the Agricultural Development Fund (ADF) as a
financial mechanism intended to provide financial support to accelerate the
implementation of the Regional Agricultural Investment Plan (RAIP) 2017-2022, which in
turn implements the Regional Agricultural Policy (RAP). The SADC Council approved
the establishment of the Agricultural Development Fund in Pretoria, South Africa, in
August 2017, as a Special Facility under the SADC Regional Development Fund, in
accordance with Article 8 of the Agreement on the Operationalisation of the SADC
Regional Development Fund (ADF).
37

-----------------------Page 44 End-----------------------

(78).

To date, four consultative workshops were held in Malawi, Madagascar, Tanzania and
Zimbabwe towards operationalization of the ADF in line with Operational Guidelines that
were approved at the Joint Extraordinary Meeting of SADC Ministers responsible for
Agriculture and Food Security and Fisheries and Aquaculture held in Ezulwinini, Eswatini
in May 2017. The ADF Operational Guidelines lay down the principles of financial support
expected from the ADF to Member States and key stakeholders. More specifically, the
ADF Operational Guidelines outline who will be eligible for funding under the ADF, how
they would access that funding, and the terms and conditions for accessing and utilising
ADF funding. The next self-financed national consultative workshop will be held in
Botswana and efforts are underway to schedule the national consultative workshops of
the remaining Member States.

(79).

The Secretariat successfully coordinated the development of the SADC Biennial Report
on implementation of Malabo Declaration on African Agriculture and submitted the same
to the African Union for consideration at the African Union General Assembly in January
2018. The Biennial Report was formally launched at the 14 th Comprehensive African
Agriculture Development Programme (CAADP) Partnership Platform (PP) held in
Libreville, Gabon from 25-27th April 2018.

(80).

Measured against the calculated 2017 benchmark of 3.94 out of 10, eight SADC Member
States were ON TRACK towards achieving the goals and targets of the Malabo
Declaration and these are Botswana (4.4), Malawi (4.9), Mauritius (4.8), Mozambique
(4.1), Namibia (4.1), Seychelles (4.0), South Africa (4.1) and Eswatini (4.0). Seven
SADC countries were however NOT ON TRACK and these are Angola (2.1), DRC (1.4),
Lesotho (3.7), Madagascar (3.1), Tanzania (3.1), Zambia (3.6) and Zimbabwe (3.2).

(81).

Furthermore, out of the first seven of the eight commitments of Malabo, the Southern
Africa region is on track in four, namely, (a) Re-committing to CAADP process; (b)
Halving poverty through agriculture by 2025; (c) Boosting intra-Africa trade in agriculture
commodities; and (d) Enhancing Mutual accountability for actions and results. The region
needs to pay attention to three commitment areas where it is not on track. These are (a)
enhancing investment finance in agriculture; (b) ending hunger by 2025; and (c)
enhancing resilience to climate variability.

3.4.1.2
(82).

Regional Food Security Situation
The Regional Early Warning System and Vulnerability Assessment programme
continued to collect, analyse and disseminate data and information on food security
situation in the region. The information is aimed at facilitating preparedness and early
action in order to prevent or reduce the impact of food insecurity disasters.

3.4.1.2.1
(83).

Overview of 2017/18-rainfall season performance

The 2017/18 rainfall season was characterized by a prolonged dry spell in January 2018
for most of the southern half of the region, resulting in moisture stress and permanent
wilting of some crops. During February and March 2018 the rainfall improved and was
well above average in most parts of the region, allowing recovery of some of the crops
affected in January 2018.
38

-----------------------Page 45 End-----------------------

(84).

The high rainfall in February and March 2018 allowed for the recharge of hydrological
reservoirs and regeneration of pastures for livestock. In Botswana, south western
Madagascar, southern Malawi, southern and some central parts of Mozambique, Zambia
and Zimbabwe, the rains have continued well into April 2018.

3.4.1.2.2
(85).

Overall, the 2018/19 food security situation across the region is expected to be on
average due to late rainfall received during the 2017/18 growing season.

3.4.1.2.3
(86).

Agricultural Performance and Food security

Cereal production

Member States are currently conducting crop production and vulnerability assessments
for the 2018/2019 marketing year. Preliminary analyses for 2018/19 food security season
across the region suggests lower availability of food particularly cereals compared to last
season’s availability. In South Africa for instance, one of the main regional grain
producers, 2017/18 maize production is projected to decrease by 26%. In Zambia, which
is another major producer of grains in the region, maize production is projected to decline
by 34%. However, the high carryover stocks from the 2016/2017 bumper agricultural
season will mitigate the possible negative impacts of the reduced production. Table 3
provides a summary of all main cereal (maize, wheat, rice, and sorghum/millet)
production trends for the past 5 years’ production period to 2016/17.

3.4.1.4

Food and Nutrition Security Strategy
A financial agreement was signed in August 2017 between SADC Secretariat and the
European Union to an amount of 9 million Euro, to support the Operationalisation of the
Regional Agricultural Policy (RAP) for the next three financial years commencing April
2018 to August 2020. The implementation has three components to:
i.

Enhance information on agricultural production,
competitiveness for evidence-based decision-making;

sustainability

and

ii.

Improve access to markets through implementation of plant and animal pest and
disease strategies at the regional level; and

iii.

Facilitate implementation of some components of the Regional Food and Nutrition
Security Strategy (FNSS) in SADC Member States.

The first and second components will be implemented through a Pillar Assessessment
Grant or Delegation Agreement (PAGODA) with the UN Food and Agriculture
Organisation (FAO).
Agricultural Input Supply

(90).

The SADC Secretariat in collaboration with Member states developed the Harmonised
Seed Regulatory System (HSRS) to promote regional integration and enhance access
and availability of improved crop variety to farmers in line with the Regional Agricultural
Policy. The framework is implemented through the MOU that is currently signed by
eleven (11) Member States. To-date the HSRS has released and registered 25 crop
varieties that can be traded throughout the region without undergoing tedious steps of
variety release at national level.

(91).

The HSRS has taken quarantine and Phytosanitary Measures to outline the procedures
to protect Member States against pests and diseases in the SADC region. A regional
framework was put in place to promote access and availability of quality seeds in the
region, to enhance food security and to safeguard against transboundary crop pests and
40

-----------------------Page 47 End-----------------------

diseases. The framework is implemented through a regional pests list which indicates
pests and diseases that need to be inspected in seed consignments. The Secretariat
updated the pests list in December, 2017 to cover the newly introduced pests, the Lethal
Maize necrosis that is seed borne.
(92).

The Plant Variety Protection (PVP) protocol was approved by the Summit in August,
2017, Pretoria, South Africa as a way of ensuring increased investment in the region and
to build the confidence of the private sector and breeders.

(93).

In addition to improving access and availability of seeds to farmers in the region, the
Secretariat also focused on the promotion of safer and low risk pesticides in the
management of plant pests and diseases to enhance agricultural productivity. During
pests and disease infestations, farmers often use highly hazardous pesticides resulting
into serious risks associated with human and animal health as well as environmental
contamination. In an effort to minimise these risks the Secretariat in collaboration with
the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) conducted training on the registration of
low risk pesticides in February, 2018.

3.4.1.5

Surveillance and Control of Transboundary Plant and Animal Diseases and
Pests

(94).

The increasing threats of transboundary pests and diseases on food security, livelihoods
and national economies, have been a great concern due to their recurring frequency.
These have been exacerbated by weak biosecurity systems in the region.
Transboundary plant pests and diseases continue to pose a significant threat to the
regional food security and trade. The pests and diseases that have been identified as
eminent threats include Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI), Foot and Mouth
Disease, Contagious Bovine Pleuro Pneumonia and Peste de Petits Ruminant.

(95).

HPAI strain H5N8 outbreaks have been reported in SADC Member States. As of August
2017, the Democratic Republic of Congo, South Africa and Zimbabwe, confirmed the
outbreaks. The total production losses in the three affected Member States including loss
of both table and hatching eggs was estimated at US$810 million. In addition, there have
been more than 3000 jobs lost and other socioeconomic losses as a result of movement
restrictions.

(96).

The Secretariat and FAO are in the process of finalising a draft HPAI Emergency
Preparedness Plan which was validated by the scientific committees of the Livestock
Technical Committee (LTC) at the meeting held in March 2018.

(97).

A SADC Peste de Petit Ruminants (PPR) PPR Eradication Roadmap was approved by
Sectoral Ministers at their meeting in Ezulwini, Eswatini, May 2017. Since then 3 Member
States (Botswana, Madagascar, Namibia(zonal)) have acquired freedom from PPR given
by the World Animal Health Organisation (OIE) making it a total of six Member States
(includes, Mauritius, South Africa and Eswatini) that are free from PPR. PPR causes 85
to 100% mortality in small stock.

(98).

The Fall armyworm (FAW) was reported in 13 SADC Member States except in Lesotho
and Mauritius in the early months (February and March) of 2017 with devastating impact
41

-----------------------Page 48 End-----------------------

to the food security as it attacks maize, the crop that is used as a proxy to gauge regional
food security. At continental level, forty-two (42) Member States have been affected by
FAW. According to the case studies conducted in Zambia by FAO, and Mozambique by
Centre for Agriculture and Biosciences International (CABI) in 2017, the percentage loss
ranged from 5%-77% and 25-50% respectively. The Secretariat in collaboration with
stakeholders undertook the following measures to minimise the negative impact
associated with FAW:

(99).

3.4.1.6

i.

Capacity building activities that included training of 60 extension and research
officers from all Member States and provision of surveillance traps and
Pheromones lures to enhance timely detection of pests and diseases to prevent
their spread;

ii.

Developed training manuals and impact assessment that were distributed to all
the Member States to be used by extension officers and researchers to promote
knowledge and skill development of farmers at grass root level in the member
states; and

iii.

Facilitated development of national emergency plans to enhance preparedness
to address pests and disease outbreaks anchored on early warning and
monitoring, impact assessment, Integrated Pests management approach
management options, and coordination with engagement of broad stakeholders.

Other emerging pests include tomato leaf miner (Tuta absoluta) reported in thirteen
Member States; Lethal Maize Necrosis disease (LMND) currently restricted to Tanzania
and Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC); and the Banana Bunchy Top Virus diseases
found in Mozambique.
Disaster Preparedness for Food Security

(100).

National Early Warning Units (NEWUs) are established in most of the Member States
(Angola, Botswana, DRC Congo, Lesotho, Malawi, Madagascar, Mozambique, Namibia,
South Africa, Eswatini, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe), with the exception of
Mauritius and Seychelles. The main aim is to provide timely and reliable information on
the supply and demand for food, in particular cereals, to SADC Governments, donors
and Cooperating Partners and Institutions. During the year under review, all the NEWUs
managed to provide information for national and regional consumption.

(101).

The Secretariat in collaboration with Member States developed the Urban vulnerability
assessment Guidelines through their National Vulnerability Assessment Committees
(NVAC). Capacity building on the same has been done in all Member States except
Mauritius as they do not yet have National Vulnerability Assessment Committee (NVAC).

3.4.1.7
(102).

Joint Management of Transboundary Natural Resources
The Secretariat continued to coordinate the implementation of activities with regards to
sustainable management and conservation of wildlife and transboundary natural
resources. The joint Committee of Ministers of Environment and Natural Resources and
42

-----------------------Page 49 End-----------------------

of the Organ on Politics, Defence and Security Cooperation, as a structure put in place
to oversee and monitor the implementation of the SADC Law Enforcement and AntiPoaching (LEAP) Strategy directed the Secretariat to develop regional coordination costs
for the SADC LEAP Strategy and submit for approval by Council at the August 2017
meeting. In August 2017, the Council approved the Regional Coordination Costs for the
SADC LEAP Strategy and directed the Secretariat to mobilise resources to support the
implementation of the SADC LEAP Strategy at the regional level. Consequently, SADC
Secretariat is engaging potential partners to mobilize resources required to support the
coordination of the LEAP. Meanwhile SADC Secretariat in collaboration with partners is
in the process of developing a regional platform for exchange of information on illegal
wildlife trade and other wildlife crimes between and among Member States.
3.4.1.7.1

Implementation of SADC Transfrontire Conservation Areas

(103).

SADC Secretariat is facilitating the implementation of the SADC Transfrontier
Conservation Areas (TFCA) Programme which aims to promote cross-border
cooperation in conservation and management of shared transboundary ecosystems and
natural resources. However, lack of funding for development and implementation of
activities is a perennial challenge for many TFCAs in the region. As a solution to this
challenge, Component 2 of the SADC TFCA Programme, namely: “enhancement of
financing mechanisms for TFCAs”, calls for the establishment of sustainable financing
mechanisms for TFCAs. Pursuant to this, SADC is in the process of establishing a
dedicated regional Financing Mechanism for SADC TFCAs (commonly referred to as
TFCA Facility). The TFCA Facility would be a financial mechanism that will provide grants
to support implementation of conservation and management actions in SADC TFCAs as
stipulated in the existing TFCA Integrated Development Plans and the SADC TFCA
programme. The SADC Council, at its meeting of March 2018 approved the
establishment of the TFCA Facility to be supported by International Cooperating
Partners. So far German Government under the framework of development cooperation
between the Southern African Development Community and the Federal Republic of
Germany has pledged EUR 20 million to support the establishment of the TFCA Facility
and EUR 12 million is already committed. SADC Secretariat is coordinating the process
of finalizing implementation modalities for operationalisation of the Facility.

(104).

A Regional Monitoring and Evaluation Framework for TFCAs was developed and
approved by Ministers responsible for Environment and Natural Resources in November
2017. The objective of the framework is to assess progress made in the implementation
of the SADC TFCA Programme as well as to enable objective measurement of its
contribution to the objectives of relevant Protocols as well as SADC development
priorities as stipulated in the revised Regional Indicative Strategic Development Plan.
The SADC TFCAs Monitoring and Evaluation Framework is aligned with the overarching
SADC Results-based Monitoring and Evaluation System.

SADC Project on Forest Conservation and Sustainable Management of Forest
Resources

Following the establishment of the Thematic Expert Working Groups (EWG) for SADC
Project on Forest Conservation and Sustainable Management of Forest Resources in
43

-----------------------Page 50 End-----------------------

Southern Africa, the EWGs members have participated in capacity building programmes
for respective project thematic areas as follows:

(106).

i.

Forest Information System EWG: GIS Training for forest information system and
remote sensing;

ii.

Forest Fire Management EWG: Training of Trainers (ToT) Course in Forest Fire
Management to equip participants with requisite skills to plan and execute
controlled burning for a range of purposes; and GIS Training for Forest Fire
Management; and

iii.

Participatory Forestry Management EWG: The EWG members have received
training and exposure to successful PFM activities through a study tour and field
visits.

In addition, the project is in the process of developing Regional Guidelines on Forest
Information System, Participatory Forestry Management and Forest Fire Management
including management of transboundary fires.

3.4.1.7.3

Fisheries and Aquaculture

(107).

Fisheries and aquaculture remain important to the economies of SADC countries. In
most SADC countries, fish is the only affordable source of dietary animal protein and
therefore of critical importance for food and nutrition security. It is thus imperative for
SADC to support sustainable management of fisheries resources and development of
sustainable aquaculture in the region in order to increase production, productivity and
competitiveness of the sector. Fisheries and aquaculture sectors employ a total of about
2.5 million people, equivalent of about 1 % of the SADC population, and accounts for an
estimated 3.5% of the region’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and 9% of the region’s
agriculture GDP. More than 95% of this production comes from a diversified capture
fisheries sub-sector, which stagnated in last 10 years or so around 2.5 million tonnes,
but has recently increased to 2,8 million tonnes. This bears testimony that SADC Member
States have been improving management of fisheries resources.

(108).

A small but growing percentage of fish comes from an emerging aquaculture sub-sector
which has recently increased from 69,851 metric tons (2015) to 95,761 metric tons (2017)
(FAO FishStat, 2016; SADC, 2017). To support future needs, capture fisheries will need
to be sustained and if possible enhanced, and aquaculture developed rapidly, to increase
by an annual average of more than 8.3% by 2026, in line with the SADC Regional
Aquaculture Strategy and Action Plan (RASAP).

Despite the slow growth, the region still faces challenges with fish diseases, high costs
of feeds, and unavailability of seed continue to affect the growth of aquaculture in the
region. In addition, fish stocks continue to dwindle due to challenges with Illegal,
Unreported and Unregulated (IUU) fishing, degradation of aquatic environments, climate
change and lack of capacity to effectively manage fish stocks. However, the region is
working on mechanisms to address these challenges through promotion of sustainable
aquaculture, implementation of the SADC Ministerial Statement of Commitment to
combat IUU fishing, co-management of shared fisheries resources and protection of
aquatic environments.

(110).

Council at its meeting held in Pretoria, South Africa in August 2017 approved the Charter
establishing the SADC Fisheries Monitoring, Control and Surveillance (MCS)
Coordination Centre, and so far, six Member States have signed the Charter (Lesotho,
Mozambique, South Africa, Eswatini, Tanzania and Zambia). Ministers responsible for
Fisheries and Aquaculture established the Interim Project Management Unit in Maputo,
Mozambique to operationalise the Centre. The Government of Mozambique provided
office space and furniture, as well as secondment of a Fisheries Monitoring Control and
Surveillance (MCs) officer, and are currently recruiting a Regional MCS Coordinator with
support from the World Bank South West Indian Ocean Fisheries Governance project
(SWIOFIsh). In addition, efforts to improve information sharing amongst Member States
are currently being done through FISH-i Africa project, which was recently linked to the
Centre.

(111).

Following the approval of the SADC Regional Aquaculture Strategy and Action Plan
(2016-2026) by the Ministers responsible for Agriculture, Food Security, Fisheries and
Aquaculture in May 2017, the Secretariat developed training programmes for Member
States on aqua-feeds (development and management) and on Transformation of
Aquaculture, Fish Processing and Value Addition in the SADC Region (AquaTrans). The
Secretariat also established a Regional Platform for Genetic Improvement and
Biodiversity Management in Aquaculture to support Member States’ efforts in developing
National Fish Genetic Improvement Programmes.

(112).

Council at its meeting held in Pretoria, South Africa in March 2018 also approved that a
regional aquaculture value chain also be developed. Secretariat has engaged a
consultant to profile the regional aquaculture value chain. The study will describe the
markets and marketing infrastructure for aquaculture products in the region in terms of
45

-----------------------Page 52 End-----------------------

product volumes, product forms, price, quality and target consumers. A comprehensive
mapping exercise is expected to be conducted to identify areas that should be prioritized
for value chain development.

3.4.1.9

SADC Secretariat in collaboration with the African Union Inter-African Bureau for Animal
Resources (AU-IBAR) facilitated the establishment of the Southern African Regional
Non-State Actors (NSA) Platform in Fisheries and Aquaculture (SANSAFA) whose goals
are to coordinate implementation from the grassroots, the NSA voice and contribute to
the national and regional fisheries and aquaculture development agenda. Its key goals
are to ensure effective implementation of the SADC Protocol on Fisheries, the AU Policy
Framework and Reform Strategy for Fisheries and Aquaculture in Africa (PFRS), and the
FAO Small-Scale Fisheries (SSF) guidelines at grassroots level.
Environment and Sustainable Development
In March 2017, Council directed SADC Secretariat to seek accreditation to the Green
Climate Fund as Regional Implementing Entity (RIE) in order to access climate resources
to support the delivery of climate change adaptation and mitigation priorities in the region
as outlined in the Regional Climate Change Strategy. Accreditation to the Green Climate
Fund is a lengthy and comprehensive process that requires a dedicated team of experts
and adequate resources to see it through. Concomitant with this, the SADC Secretariat
has mobilized resources to commission a consultancy to assist in the accreditation
process.
As a response to growing recognition of the potential that maritime industries and ocean
ecosystem services can play in supporting economic growth and development, and
human welfare, SADC Secretariat in collaboration with Member States is in the process
of developing the Blue Economy Strategy, as one of the means to enhance sustainable
development of the resources in the Region. In order to kick-start the process, the
Secretariat is commissioning a study to review relevant regional, continental and
international frameworks and literature, and mapping out of stakeholders in the SADC
blue economy approach, as well as examine how the transition to blue economy might
transform SADC countries.
Conservation of Plan Genetic Resources

(116).

Programmes to promote the conservation and utilization of plant genetic resources in the
SADC region continued under the coordination of the SADC Plant Genetic Resources
Centre (SPGRC), which is based in Lusaka, Republic of Zambia. Activities during
2017/18 focused mainly on capacity building on conservation of plant genetic resources
and through collection missions to Member States, as well as recapitalization of the
regional genebank at the SPGRC.

(117).

Through the network of National Plant Genetic Resource Centres (NPGRCs), which are
functional in most of the SADC Member States, the SPGRC carried out the following
programmes:
i.

Conducted a training workshop on plant genetic resources conservation attended
by NPGRCs from all the SADC Member States in Lusaka in August 2017 cofunded by the NEPAD SANBio;
46

-----------------------Page 53 End-----------------------

ii.

Partnered with the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and
Agriculture (ITPGRFA) to train plant genetic resources conservation officers from
SADC Member States on Global Information Systems for food and agriculture in
Cape Town, South Africa in December 2017;

iii.

Multiplied 351 Rice samples in Malawi, where soil and weather conditions are
suitable for long term storage for the SPGRC; and

iv.

Jointly with NPGRC partners conducted plant genetic resources collection
missions and a total of 884 plant accessions were collected.

Social and Human Development

3.4.2.1

Education

(118).

In order to address societal and other barriers to the provision of quality, relevant and
sustainable education and training, which continue to inhibit life-long learning
opportunities of the largest population group of the region (children and youth), a number
of outputs were realized, and are described below.

3.4.2.1.1
(119).

Implementation of the Protocol on Education

The Secretariat continued to facilitate the implementation of the SADC Protocol on
Education and Training focusing on four outputs of the Revised RISDP namely (i)
approval and establishment of a regional mechanism for coordinating the implementation
of the SADC Qualification Framework; (ii) revision of the SADC Technical and Vocational
Education and Training Strategic Framework; (iii) mainstreaming the impact of HIV and
AIDS in the Education sector and (iv) domestication and monitoring the implementation
of Continental and International Commitments on education in particular the Continental
Education Strategy for Africa (CESA). Key achievements include:
i.

Inclusion of CESA Indicators to the Regional Education Indicators to facilitate
monitoring of the implementation of the SADC Protocol on Education and Training
and continental commitments including the Continental Education Strategy for
Africa in the region. Education Management officials from five countries
(Botswana, Namibia, South Africa, Seychelles and Zimbabwe) were trained on
the online SADC Monitoring and Evaluation System to input data on education
indicators in the system;

ii.

Revision of the Technical Vocational Education and Training (TVET) Strategic
Framework and development of the Implementation Plan 2018-2027;

iii.

Implementation of Phase 2 of the SADC Care and Support for Teaching and
Learning Programme by seven Member States (Democratic Republic of Congo,
Malawi, Mozambique, South Africa, Eswatini, Zambia and Zimbabwe). These
countries have domesticated the SADC Care and Support for Teaching and
Learning by developing national models, which provide national objectives and
47

-----------------------Page 54 End-----------------------

standards of practice for implementing Care and Support for Teaching and
Learning (CSTL) as a national programme; and
iv.

3.4.2.1.2
(120).

Member States are integrating CSTL principles into policy development,
programmes, planning and budget and scaling up into more schools
demonstrating systematic mainstreaming of CSTL in the Education System.
Furthermore, continuous capacity building of teachers through in-service teacher
programme and key stakeholders on issues of sexual reproductive health and the
new Life Skills Education curriculum as well as safety and protection is ongoing
in Member States.

Employment and Labour

The features of Labour Migration in the region include among others predominance of
the economic importance of migrant remittances; increasing feminization of labour
mobility; inadequate protection for migrant workers and their families from exploitation
and hostility; sluggish implementation of regional free movement schemes; weaknesses
of pertinent labour market legislation, institutions and data; lack of attention to
governance and regulation of labour and skills mobility; weak intra-regional compatibility
and recognition of training institutions and qualifications. In order to address some of
these issues the following have been undertaken:

3.4.2.1.3

Employment and Labour policy and the Future of Work

(121).

The Future of Work Initiative, which is led by the International Labour Organisation (ILO),
seeks to address present and future workplace challenges related to “work and society”,
“decent jobs for all”, “the organization of work and production” as well as “the governance
of work.” There is concern that if not addressed well and urgently, the future of work will
result in widening inequalities, within and between countries, as well as entrenched
poverty for the majority, posing a risk to social cohesion and peace.

(122).

In line with the Initiative, SADC has adopted a regional common position on the Future
of Work, as part of its contribution to the global discourse on the rapid transformations
visible in the world of work. The SADC position is based on national reports from nine
(9) Member States (Lesotho, Eswatini, Madagascar, Mauritius, Namibia, Seychelles,
South Africa, Tanzania and Zimbabwe) that undertook national dialogues on the Future
of Work.

3.4.2.1.4
(123).

SADC Decent Work Programme (2013-2019)

The Employment and Labour Sector held a High Level Ministerial Symposium in March
2018 on the role of Multi-National Enterprises (MNEs) in promoting decent work in the
SADC region. The Symposium largely considered the key findings of a rapid assessment
of the impact on investment, employment and labour issues of the operations of MNEs
operating in Botswana, Malawi, Namibia, South Africa, Eswatini , Zambia and Zimbabwe.
The assessment revealed that although Foreign Direct Inflows (FDI) into the SADC
region were very low averaging around 2% of world flows, pointing to weak integration
48

-----------------------Page 55 End-----------------------

in the global economy, MNEs in SADC had contributed positively to capital inflows,
output and export growth, productivity growth (through skills development) and
employment creation in the host countries. MNEs in mining, retail and food processing
also generally provided higher wages and better working conditions than local
companies did, sometimes by up to 100%, due to their advantages in higher productivity,
efficiency, better technology and higher levels of capital intensity.
(124).

However, the Employment and Labour Sector observed that weak linkages between
MNEs and local firms limited the contribution of MNEs to local economic development.
Additionally, the dominant form of FDI in most countries was found to be in the extractive
sector that tends to foster fewer linkages with the local economy owing to its capital
intensive nature. Apart from contributing to direct employment and a share of export
earnings, economy-wide benefits of FDI were therefore few. In this regard, the Ministers
and Social Partners observed the need to strengthen MNEs’ linkages with the local
economy through the following measures:

3.4.2.1.5
(125).

i.

Member States should create an enabling environment for fostering greater
linkages between MNEs and local producers and to ensure that MNEs activities
are aligned with national development priorities and legal frameworks;

ii.

Member States should ensure that MNEs respect workers’ rights through effective
labour inspection in line with international best practice, including through
participation of the social partners in the design, implementation and monitoring
of interventions;

iii.

Member States should expedite the ratification and domestication of all key ILO
Conventions as a way of closing legislative gaps through harmonized labour law
and practice in the region;

iv.

SADC should support a regional approach to Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and
development that would offer a more comprehensive approach involving key
stakeholders to deal with the economic, social and environmental aspects of
investments by MNEs; and

v.

The SADC Secretariat is actively supporting Member States to implement the
above commitments. As a first step, a targeted capacity-building seminar for
government officials and social partners was undertaken in the third quarter of
2018 to enhance capacities.

Cross border portability of social protection instruments

During the 2017/18 period, the Employment and Labour Sector deepened its
implementation of the SADC Code on Social Security of 2007 and the SADC Cross
Border Portability of Accrued Social Security Benefits Framework of 2016. These
frameworks provide that everyone in SADC has a right to social security and that Member
States must establish mechanisms to facilitate the portability of social security benefits
from one country to another. With the support of the European Union and International
Labour Organisation, SADC is implementing an 18-month Project on “strengthening
capacity and policy instruments on portability of social security benefits in the SADC
49

-----------------------Page 56 End-----------------------

region”. Under the project, the SADC Secretariat has currently commissioned two (2)
ongoing assessment studies on the state of social protection access and potential for
portability of benefits for migrant workers in the agricultural and mining sectors in pilot
SADC Member States. As approved by the ELS Ministers and Social Partners in March
2018, the assessment in the agricultural sector includes the following pilot countries:
Eswatini, Lesotho, South Africa, Malawi, Mozambique and Zimbabwe. The assessment
in the mining sector includes the following pilot countries: Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho,
Mozambique, South Africa, Zambia and Zimbabwe.
(126).

A third study on the financial services sector to understand key intervention areas and
enablers, including mechanisms for design and implementation of a model framework
for portability of social security benefits is also underway.

(127).

An Ad Hoc Troika of Employment and Labour Sector Social Security Experts has been
established to strengthen governance oversight on the project, through which the SADC
Employment and Labour Sector has adopted a roadmap that envisages adoption of a
mechanism of portability of social security benefits in the region by Ministers and Social
Partners in April 2019. The SADC social security portability framework covers old-age
benefit, invalidity benefit, occupational injury and disease benefit, unemployment benefit
and survivors' benefit.

3.4.2.2

Health and Pharmaceuticals

(128).

Malaria continues to be a major challenge for the region as it poses resistance to
treatment with the cheaper medicine, chloroquine, and this has necessitated the need
for countries to change to more expensive treatment regimes. Some cross border
malaria control initiatives have continued to lead to a decrease in the incidence of malaria
particularly the use of Indoor Residual Spraying using DDT. Member States
implementing the E8 initiative which was established by the Ministers of Health in 2013
have made strides in undertaking measures, which are geared towards malaria
elimination. The countries, which include Botswana, Namibia, South Africa and Eswatini
(frontline 4) are close to elimination. Angola, Mozambique, Zambia and Zimbabwe
(Second line countries) are showing some improvements. To date, there is increased
projection towards malaria elimination and there is active monitoring towards elimination
using a score card.

(129).

A SADC medicines data base for information sharing on prices has been established, as
well as a host of other laboratory innovations in the member states.

(130).

Implementation Plan for the SADC Strategy on Nutrition relating to Social & Human
Development was developed and approved by Joint meeting of SADC Ministers of
Health and Ministers responsible for HIV and AIDS in November 2017. The
Implementation Plan identifies priority areas that need to be implemented in order to
address the nutrition indicators that are performing poorly in several Member States
within the Region. The priority areas which are also reflected in the SADC Regional Food
and Nutrition Security Strategy include:

50

-----------------------Page 57 End-----------------------

3.4.2.3

i.

Development of regional minimum standards for micronutrient fortification of food.
This is expected to address high levels of anaemia in women of reproductive age
and children while at the same time improving nutrition of the general population;

ii.

Development of a regional strategy for communication for behavior change for
improved infant and young child feeding practices. This is expected to address
multiple indicators on nutrition including, overweight and obesity, wasting,
stunting, exclusive breastfeeding and micronutrient deficiency;

iii.

Development of regional guidelines on nutrition information systems that will
strengthen Member States’ capacity to monitor progress against the World Health
Assembly targets; and

iv.

A monitoring tool was developed and approved in November 2017, to monitor the
implementation of various actions of the Protocol on Health as directed by
Ministers of responsible for Health at Ezulwini, Eswatini in November 2016. The
actions being monitored by the tool include: (i) Capacity building efforts for health;
(II) Investments, prioritization and implementation of International Health
Regulation (IHR) activities; and (ii) Existence of implementation plan and
Monitoring and Evaluation Frameworks to monitor protocol on health.

Orphans, Vulnerable Children and Youth Development and Employment

(131).

In order to improve the quality of evidence-based policies, programmes and reporting on
vulnerable children and youth (OVC &Y), the Secretariat, in collaboration with Member
States has developed a Framework for Monitoring, Evaluation and Reporting (MER) to
facilitate research and data collection on specific issues of OVC&Y. This initiative is key
to maintaining a regional information system and data bank that reflects the patterns,
levels and trends in OVC&Y challenges. This in turn facilitates identification of emerging
issues and advocacy for timely responses. The Framework, which has been finalized,
provides regional indicators with definitions and the template for reporting by Member
States in addition, the MER provides a schedule for strengthening capacity and
operationalization plan of the MER at Member States. The database is being developed
as part of the overall SADC M&E system.

(132).

There were some efforts towards the implementation of Minimum Package of Services
(MPS), which are fundamental for the provision of services to orphans, vulnerable
children and youths. MPS identifies those services which are considered critical for the
development and wellbeing of children and young people of SADC, and is utilised by
Member States as a policy guide for the delivery of comprehensive services for OVC&Y.
Pursuant to the implementation of MPS, the Secretariat coordinated and facilitated the
participation of SADC Member States in the Regional Psychosocial Support (PSS)
Forum held in Arusha from 3 to 7 September 2017. The PSS forum provided an
opportunity to review progress on the adoption and application of Minimum Package of
Services (MPS) and Psychosocial Support (PSS) standards. It enabled participants to
assess the gaps in addressing children and youth vulnerabilities and share good
practices.

3.4.2.3.2
(134).

Regional MER for youth database/information portal established

Regional Research Agenda on OVC and Youth established

SADC signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Regional Psychosocial Support
Initiative (REPSSI), and the partnership is to conduct a regional assessment on the
adoption and application of the SADC Minimum Package of Services for OVC and
Psychosocial Support (PSS) standards in Member States. This will go a long way to
assessing the extent of psychosocial support for young people in the region and lead to
high impact interventions to be adopted and implemented at Member State level.

3.4.3

Cross-Cutting Programmes

3.4.3.1

Poverty Reduction

(135).

The Secretariat continued to facilitate the harmonization of standards, methods of data
collection and for the common poverty indicators. In this regard, a Concept Note and
Project proposal were developed to undertake a study on Poverty Measurements and
Profiles in the Member States with respect to how the poverty statistics are generated
and the need to have a common position on reporting on poverty trends.

(136).

Studies on Poverty Trends and Sustainable Development Goals as well as study to
Protocol Tracker with respect to the relationship between SADC Protocol implementation
issues and poverty and development in SADC were commissioned through the support
of the Southern Africa Trust. The draft reports for the two studies are under review.

3.4.3.2
(137).

Combating of the HIV and AIDS Pandemic
HIV remains an urgent threat to the region with significant new infections amongst
adolescents and youth, predominantly females. In an effort to mitigate the threat the
SADC Region has continued to implement HIV and AIDS interventions for all the
thematic areas articulated in the Maseru Declaration on HIV and AIDS as follows:

3.4.3.2.1
(138).

Prevention and Social Mobilisation

Member States continued to implement a number of HIV prevention and social
mobilization activities. The HIV and AIDS 2017 Epidemic Report indicates some
52

-----------------------Page 59 End-----------------------

progress in controlling new HIV infections in the past 6 years (2010-2016). The SADC
Region recorded a 26% decline in new HIV infections among adults aged 15-49 years.
A number of HIV prevention indicators reveal that more effort is needed in the area of
HIV prevention. HIV infections are still high in adolescent girls and young women, female
sex workers, and men who have sex with men as well as in the LGBTI community. Data
from the report shows that there has been greater progress in the area of treatment
compared to prevention. Despite this, 3 SADC Member States have reported the ART
coverage below 50% (see Figure 11). Data from SADC Member States shows that in
seven of the ten Member States that provided data on HIV prevalence among sex
workers, the HIV prevalence rates are greater than 55%.

Member States, in collaboration with UN Agencies, have developed the “Framework for
target setting for HIV Prevention in the SADC Region”. The framework is a guide for
setting national targets for the 5 pillars of HIV prevention including: national condom
programmes; health services for adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) and their
male partners in high-prevalence locations, prevention programmes for key populations;
voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC); and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP).

(140).

A SADC Regional Strategy for HIV and AIDS Prevention, Treatment and Care and
Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights among Key Populations” was developed
and approved. The purpose of the Strategy is to promote the adoption and
institutionalisation of a standard, comprehensive package that addresses the unique
challenges in providing equitable and effective HIV and SRH rights and services to key
populations in SADC. The regional strategy will serve as a guide to Member States in
designing and implementing appropriate SRH and HIV prevention, treatment and care
programmes for key populations focusing on policy, legal, institutional and facility levels
issues.

Prevention of Mother-To-Child Transmission of HIV (PMTCT)

PMTCT is one of the most successful HIV prevention interventions in the region. The
2016 data from Member States shows that PMTCT coverage ranged from 64% to 100%.
The majority of the Member States (9 out of the 12) that reported data on this indicator
have PMTCT coverage of 88% and above as provided in Figure 12 below. These data
clearly show that the region is on course to eliminating transmission of HIV from mothers
to their unborn babies.

AIDS Treatment

All SADC Member States have adopted the “Treat All” Strategy although they are at
different stages in its operationalization. In line with the 2013 WHO Treatment Guidelines
and the ‘Test and Treat” Strategy, large numbers of people living with HIV are now
eligible for treatment and this means that there are more people on treatment. This calls
for financial commitment by governments to sustain treatment for all who are eligible. In
2016, adult ART coverage in SADC ranged from 20.7% to 76% as indicated in Figure 13
below. Treatment is an important focus in the 90-90-90 treatment cascade, which sets
out that by 2020, 90% of people who are HIV infected will be diagnosed, 90% of people
who are diagnosed will be on antiretroviral treatment and 90% of those who receive
antiretroviral will be virally suppressed. Two (2) years remain before 2020, which calls
for Member States to scale-up both HIV Testing, Counselling and treatment towards
realization of the 2020 targets.

Intensifying Resources Mobilisation

External funding for HIV and AIDS in SADC Member States has been declining.
However, external funding from the US President’s Emergency Response Plan on
HIV/AIDS (PEPFAR) has been instrumental to fund HIV prevention and treatment
programmes in SADC Member states who are PEPFAR focus countries. This funding
has started to decline due to changes in US funding policy on global health. Member
States efforts to bridge the financing gap using domestic resources to the health sector
have consistently fell below the Abuja Declaration target of allocating 15% of national
budgets to the health sector. Data from SADC Member States indicate that only one out
of the ten countries, which reported on this indicator managed to realise this target in
2016. National budgets allocated to the health sector in 2016 ranged between 8.25% to
15% as indicated in Figure 14 below.

SADC HIV and AIDS Cross Border Initiative (CBI)

(144).

Global Fund supported HIV services in 32 Wellness Clinics located in 12 SADC mainland
Member States to target population groups: sex workers (SWs); long distance trucks
drivers (LDTD); and communities around the borders. Services provided include HIV
testing services; condoms distribution; diagnostic and treatment of sexually transmitted
infections; and primary health care services. In total, 84,461 people were tested for HIV
at Cross Border Initiative (CBI) wellness sites between July 2011 and December, 2017
of which 60.9% were community members; 25.5% were long distance truck drivers
(LDTDs); and 13.6% were sex workers.

(145).

One of the key focus areas of the CBI was to generate demand for HIV testing and
counselling among sex workers, long distance truck drivers and community members.
This was done through community mobilization activities using a standard HIV
prevention package. This package was based on the SADC Regional Minimum
Standards for Health and HIV and AIDS in the Road Transport sector.

(146).

Percentage of SWs, LDTDs and community members living with HIV experienced
significant declined between 2011 and 2017 (see Figure 15). The percentage of SWs
living with HIV (who were reached through project interventions) declined from 50% in
2011 to 13.2% in 2017, a decline of about 74 percentage points. The corresponding
declines in the percentage living with HIV among LDTDs and community members were
75 and 60 percentage points respectively. Although there could be multiple factors
responsible for this decline, there is no doubt that structured CBI community mobilization
activities played a major role.

SADC Charter on Women in Science, Engineering and Technology (WISETO)

The draft SADC Charter in Women in Science, Engineering and Technology (SADC
WISETO) was approved by Council in August 2017 in South Africa. The Purpose of the
Charter is to establish a regional platform that will implement regional programmes and
projects to promote women in science, engineering and technology. It is therefore
expected to enhance the application of science, technology & innovation by women to
support the industrialization strategy. The Charter calls for the establishment of National
Chapters which will constitute the membership of the regional SADC WISETO. The
Regional consultative meeting on approved WISETO was convened in December 2017
in Eswatini, to sensitize stakeholders on the approved Charter and to agree on the
hosting criteria.

A draft Regional Framework and Guidelines on establishment and strengthening of
Centres of Excellence and Centres of Specialisation was developed. The Framework
and Guidelines will guide the establishment of regional industrial Centres of Excellence
and Centres of Specialisation in the key priority value chains, to serve as platforms for
capacity building, knowledge generation, innovation, technology development and
commercialisation. The SADC Industrialization Strategy and Roadmap identifies Centres
of Excellence and Centres of Specialisation as platforms to facilitate industrial
development. The draft Framework and Guidelines will be considered by the various
SADC policy structures for endorsement in June/July 2018 and approval by Council of
Ministers in August 2018.
Statistics

(151).

During the past financial period, Statistics Unit made significant progress in capacity
building initiatives to enhance statistical computation at national level. In particular, a
roadmap for implementation of trade in service statistics was developed and real sector
statistics have been enhanced with technical cooperation and support from IMF as a
collaborative partner. In addition, capacity building was provided to Member States in the
area of trade, national accounts and prices statistics in partnership with Pan-African
Institutions.

(152).

Monthly release of harmonized consumer price indices to monitor inflation as a
macroeconomic convergence target were produced and disseminated. Selected
Indicators comprising of macroeconomic and social statistics were used to produce an
annual bulletin of SADC region on economic performance, trade liberalization and
demographic characteristics. The bulletin highlights SADC programme efforts in terms
of increased intra-SADC trade, life expectancy and industrial output.

(153).

Visibility of statistics in regional forums were enhanced through data quality assessments
of macroeconomic statistics in SADC Economic Reviews missions with both users and
producers of statistics. Specific areas of interventions included assessment of quality
control of price data collection, national practices in production of industrial indicators,
compliance with international best practice in the area of national accounts and
availability of statistical business register to conduct regular census and surveys.

SADC Regional-National Linkages

(154).

The Secretariat continued to assist Member States to establish and strengthen the SADC
National Committees (SNCs) following the decision of Council to have this exercise done
in accordance with the provisions of Article 16A of the SADC Treaty. With support from
GIZ, Scoping Studies were completed and presented to the national stakeholders in
Malawi, Tanzania and Zambia, and SADC National Committees (SNCs) were
established or revived. Preliminary meetings and national workshops were held in
59

-----------------------Page 66 End-----------------------

Botswana, Lesotho and Eswatini for the Scoping Studies to be undertaken, which will
lead to the establishment and strengthening of the SNCs.
(155).

The SADC National Structures were capacitated in line with (re-) establishment of the
SADC National Committees (SNCS) to ensure effective implementation and alignment
of national and regional development priorities. (re-) establishment of the SNCs is
conducted in collaboration and alongside the roll-out of the Online Monitoring and
Evaluation (M&E) System to Member States.

(156).

SADC Common positions on inter-regional and continental integration agenda were
developed, presented and implemented. The Secretariat formulated SADC Positions, on
the African Union Institutional Reforms as well as thematic areas on infrastructure
development, trade, peace and security. The Secretariat also made SADC positions on
United Nations developmental issues, and the Tripartite Free Trade Area as well as the
Continental Free Trade Area (CFTA).

Strategy Development
The draft Concept Note for consultations with the stakeholders on SADC's Post-2020
Vision was developed and priorities were identified within the framework of the
conclusions of the SADC Ministerial Retreat on "The SADC We Want". The Concept
Note and the priorities will form the basis for the development of the Vision. Formulation
of Vision and development of the Implementation Plan and Road-map for the
Conclusions of the Ministerial Retreat will commence in 2018/19.
Planning and Programming
SADC continues to undertake Planning and Programming functions in line with the 2012
SADC Policy for Strategy Development, Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation (SPME
Policy). The SPME Policy’s purpose is “to strengthen SADC’s decision-making process
regarding priority setting, resource allocation and programme management to improve
performance towards SADC’s objectives”. The Annual Corporate Plan (Operational Plan
and Budget) for 2018/19 was prepared and adopted by Council in March 2018.
Operationalization of the Annual Corporate Plan is interconnected to other key
management processes such as strategy development, budgeting, resource
mobilisation, monitoring and evaluation, procurement and management information.
Monitoring, Evaluation and Reporting
A total of 219 participants in five Member States were successfully trained on the use of
online Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) System and review of implementation of the
Revised RISDP as follows: 36 in Lesotho; 40 in Mauritius; 40 in Eswatini; 65 in Zambia;
and 38 in Zimbabwe. In addition, thirty (30) SADC Secretariat staff were also trained on
use of the Online System to enable efficient monitoring and reporting on implementation
of the Revised RISDP, and Summit and Council Decisions. Monitoring and Evaluation
frameworks for Trade Related Facility Project; Transfrontier Conservation Areas; and
Orphans, Vulnerable Children and Youths were developed. In addition, indicators for
Education and Skills Development programmes; and Science, Technology and
Innovation were developed.

IMPLEMENTATION OF CORPORATE ACTIVITIES

4.1

Finance

(1).

The content of the management accounts was improved to include more meaningful
information (both financial and non-financial). Further, internal controls on financial
management were strengthened by developing and introducing new templates for bank
reconciliations and age-analyses of debtors and creditors. In addition, a number of
checklists were developed to help improve on compliance with internal controls and
Financial Regulations. Other achievements include holding a handover ceremony to
allow for a smooth transition of the Board of Auditors and planning meeting for the audit
of the 2017/18 financial year. The SADC Board of Auditors issued an unqualified opinion
on the 2016/17 Annual Financial Statements.

(2).

The Secretariat successfully filled 18 positions (5 Directors, 1 Secretary to SADCAT and
12 Senior Officers) and the shortlisting of the 24 Officer positions was completed.

(3).

Comprehensive Operational and Strategic Risk Registers were developed to guide the
management of risks that are aligned with implementation of the 2018/19 Corporate plan.

Information and Telecommunication Technology
In order to improve on the effectiveness and efficiency in service delivery, the Secretariat
continued to operationalize ICT applications such as the SADC Integrated Management
System (SIMS), Procurement Management System, Sun Systems, Human Resource
information system and other regional applications. Projects such as the Electronic
Records Management System(ERMS), Governance, Risk and Compliance(GRC) and
revamping of the Intranet were also being implemented

Communications and Public Relations
The Secretariat commenced the registration and securing of the SADC trademarks
namely; SADC logo; SADC acronym; and the name, Southern African Development
Community. The SADC trademark applications are being registered for protection
directly to countries that are not members of the African Regional Intellectual Property
Organisation (ARIPO) and the World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO). By May
30, 2018, Registration of the Marks was successfully completed in Botswana.

Procurement
The Secretariat continued to strengthen compliance with procurement procedures in the
procurement processes. In this regard, the Secretariat continued to convene SADC
Internal Tender Committee (SITC) meetings for all procurements above the USD 10,000,
which is the approval threshold. Of all the submissions submitted for adjudication, over
90% were approved by the Committee. The SADC External Tender Committee also met
in February 2018 and adjudicated over the pre-qualification documents for Stationery,
Travel and Events Management, for Bush clearing and fencing of the Rasesa Regional
61

Procurement and Grants Policy, Regulations and all standard templates have been
published on the Website and are accessible by the general public as part of
dissemination and user awareness creation.

5.

CONTINENTAL COOPERATION AND INTEGRATION

5.1

African Union (AU)

(1).

The Secretariat engaged actively in the institutional reform agenda of the African Union
which started in 2007. SADC developed a Position Paper raising the concerns from the
region, and proposed recommendations, on how the reform agenda can be taken
forward while being considerate to the views from the Member States. The SADC
position paper was submitted to the AU Chairperson in November 2017. Subsequent to
that President Kagame, in his capacity as the leader of the Institutional Reform agenda,
updated the Assembly on the implementation of Assembly decision
(Assembly/AU/DEC.635 (XXVIII)) on AU Institutional Reform. The SADC position was
also presented to AU Assembly, during the 30th AU Assembly, by the SADC
Chairperson. Importantly the statement by the Chairperson of SADC emphasized the
need to consider the concerns raised by SADC before the proposed reforms are
implemented. In consideration with SADC position, Decision Assembly/AU/DEC.24
(XXX) opened a door for further consultations on the reforms.

(2).

The Secretariat also collaborated with the AUC on issues of Peace and Security and on
the implementation of the broader agenda of Silencing the Guns in Africa by 2020
through, among others, the Africa Peace and Security Architecture (APSA) Programme.
Due to institutional start-up challenges at the AUC-EU level, the SADC APSA III
programme encountered a slow start. A Grant Contract was signed in May 2017, which
is one and a half years later than the originally anticipated start time. In addition, SADC
received its first tranche of funding in November 2017, which is six months following the
signing of the Grant Contract. In this regard, limited progress was made. This includes
the SADC contribution to capacity building for Early Warning for Member State
stakeholders in the form of training and support to the establishment of National Early
Warning Centres in two Member States. The Secretariat supported the establishment
and functioning of National Early Warning Centres (NEWC) in the DRC and Tanzania.
Capacity was also strengthened to support Member States’ efforts on counter-terrorism
and peace support operations. Support was further provided towards Conflict
Management through strengthening of the human resource capacity of the SADC
Standby Force Planning Element, development of manuals, as well as scenario
development planning.

62

-----------------------Page 69 End-----------------------

5.2

SADC – COMESA – EAC Tripartite Agenda

(3).

The Tripartite Transport and Transit Facilitation Programme (TTTFP) continued to be
implemented to facilitate the development of a more competitive, integrated and
liberalized regional road transport market that can effectively contribute to regional
integration and economic development. This will be achieved through the development
and implementation of harmonized road transport policies, laws, regulations, standards
for efficient cross-border road transport and transit networks, transport and logistics
services, systems and procedures in the East Africa-Sothern Africa (EA-SA) region.

(4).

SADC Secretariat is the lead REC managing the TTTFP. The Tripartite Ministers
responsible for Infrastructure launched the programme in October 2017 in Dar es
Salaam, Tanzania. To date the programme has developed and subjected for validation
the Vehicle Load Management Agreement and the Multilateral Cross Border Road
Transport Agreement and five model laws, which will guide Member States in the
domestication of the agreements.

6.

Development Cooperation and Resource Mobilisation

(5).

In line with the August 2015 Council decision directing the Secretariat to constitute a
Technical Working Group (TWG) comprising experts from Member States to coordinate
work on the development of a draft “SADC Regional Resource Mobilization Framework”,
the Secretariat continued to implementation the outstanding activities including the
benchmarking missions to the African Union Commission (AUC), the Economic
Community of West African States (ECOWAS), the Economic Community of Central
African States (ECCAS) and the Republic of Rwanda that were successfully concluded
between October 2017 and January 2018, to complement the research that has been
conducted on various options for alternative sources of income, namely, Financial
Transaction Tax; Lottery; Philanthropy; Regional Events; Tourism Levy; Export and
Import Tax Levy; Transport Levy and Curbing Illicit Financial Flows.

(6).

During its fourth meeting in February 2018, the TWG also, among others, received
papers submitted by Member States on country positions with regard to the possible
impact of the proposed options of alternative sources of funding to their respective
economies. A progress report was submitted to Council in March 2018, and the
Secretariat finalized the SADC Regional Resource Mobilisation Framework for
consideration by the Committee of Ministers of Finance and Investment in July 2018.
Ministers noted the submission and urged Member States to further interrogate how they
could each raise funds under the proposed options. The Secretariat will as directed
convene a joint meeting of Senior Treasury Officials and Central Bank Officials to further
interrogate this work.

(7).

In view of the above, the Secretariat has mobilized resources through GIZ to enable the
implementation of outstanding works including the in-depth economic impact
assessment studies to Member States, and to facilitate the finalization of the draft SADC
Regional Resource Mobilisation Framework that shall also take into account the
instruments proposed by the AfDB, accordingly to the August 2017 Council Decision.
63

-----------------------Page 70 End-----------------------

(8).

Alongside domestic resource mobilisation, the Secretariat also continued to engage
International Cooperating Partners (ICPs) in order to facilitate mobilisation of resources
for the implementation of the priority regional programmes and projects that are aligned
with the SADC priorities, in line with the Windhoek Declaration adopted in 2006 to guide
cooperation between SADC and ICPs.

(9).

International Cooperating Partners (ICPs) continued to extend their support both
technically and financially, notably, among others, the European Union through the
European Development Fund (EDF) and individual countries such as Germany that
provided substantial resources.
Significant support was also received from
Organizations such as AfDB, World Bank, Commonwealth, World Health Organization,
Food and Agriculture Organization, USAID, United Nations (UN) Agencies, the Global
Fund, and Regional institutions such as the Southern African Trust. Further, several
agreements and other legal instruments were concluded.

6.1

SADC – EU Cooperation

(10).

Under the EDF cycle, the SADC-EU Programme of support identifies and implements
programmes under focal and non-focal areas, as well as through Technical Cooperation
Facilities) (TCFs). The facility makes funding available for technical assistance to
Project/Programme preparation and implementation, including pre-feasibility studies,
feasibility studies, identification missions and other assistance on specific matters related
to project preparation, monitoring and evaluation.

(11).

The 11th EDF Regional Indicative Programme (RIP) was signed in June 2015 and covers
the period 2014 – 2020, earmarking €1.332 billion for three focal areas, namely: (i)
Peace, Security and Regional Stability, (ii) Regional Economic Integration; and (iii)
Regional Natural Resource Management, benefitting the Eastern African, Southern
African and Indian Ocean (EA-SA-IO) Region.

(12).

From the Sub-regional envelope, SADC was allocated 90 million Euros, with the balance
distributed among other RECs, namely: COMESA, EAC, IGAD and IOC. The Secretariat,
in collaboration with the EU, is in the process of programming its €90 million allocation
of the Sub-regional envelope through formulation of the following projects with the
respective status of programming.

For hard infrastructure, an indicative pipeline of 30 regional priority projects was
submitted to the EU for consideration for funding. So far €200 million has been
committed as seed funding to leverage finance for specific projects identified in the hard
infrastructure priority list. However, no funds have yet been contracted for actual
infrastructure projects. It is anticipated that contracting for individual projects will take
place during 2017 through to 2020.

(15).

For soft infrastructure, the RECs who are jointly implementing the RIP are in the process
of preparing soft infrastructure projects in the areas of Energy, Transport, ICT, Aviation,
Maritime Transport and Railways. Energy and Transport projects have recently been
approved by the EU and are ready for implementation. The Energy component is a €7
million programme aiming to ensure a harmonised, efficient and gender-sensitive
regulatory environment and stronger regulatory associations and power pools allowing
for increased regional power trade. The Transport component is an €20 million transport
and transit facilitation programme, aimed at a more competitive, integrated and
liberalised regional road transport market in the tripartite region. Together they absorb
over 30% of the foreseen budget for this envelope. Below is the listing of soft
infrastructure projects under the 11th EDF Soft Infrastructure Envelope.

SADC - EU Political Dialogue

(18).

Political Dialogue is one of the main pillars of the Cotonou Partnership Agreement signed
by the European Union (EU) and the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) Group of
States in 2000. The SADC-EU Political Dialogue was launched at the SADC-EU
Ministerial Conference in Berlin, Germany, in September 2004. The practice is for the
two sides to hold Senior Officials’ Political Dialogue once annually and the Ministerial
Political Dialogue once every two years, alternating between the EU and SADC Regions.

(19).

The Dialogue seeks to create a platform for the EU and the ACP Group of States to
deliberate on global, continental and regional challenges, as well as major political
factors affecting development, cooperation and programming. It is also intended to
reinforce the relations between SADC and the EU, and to establish a platform for high
level dialogue with a view to support democracy at all levels, promote cooperation in
trade and encourage policies aimed at sustainable economic growth and economic
reforms in the Southern African Region.

(20).

A Senior Officials’ Dialogue was held in Gaborone, Botswana in June 2017 and the last
SADC-EU Ministerial Political Dialogue was held in Pretoria, South Africa in March, 2018
to re-affirm common areas of interest between the two sides, as well as commitment to
address emerging and evolving issues including global governance, trade, migration,
and climate change. The last Ministerial Political Dialogue also reaffirmed commitment
to achieve consolidated, sustainable and inclusive growth to create jobs, and endorsed
the focus by SADC on industrialization, the development of value chains and
infrastructure development, with a clearly defined role for the private sector, as key pillars
to sustainable growth and development.

SADC/Germany Cooperation

(21).

Germany remains a major partner for SADC, and SADC-Germany cooperation has
produced notable results in the priority areas of cooperation. The total volume of bilateral
Technical and Financial Cooperation (respectively through GIZ and KfW) provided by
the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ) since the
cooperation began in 1995 exceeds €341 million. Germany provides further support to
the SADC Regional Integration Agenda through its contributions to the EDF by virtue of
its membership to the European Union, and has continued to cooperate with individual
SADC Member States under bilateral cooperation as well as other sub-regional and
national SADC institutions.

(22).

Areas of cooperation are agreed through SADC-Germany Bilateral Consultations on
Cooperation held once every two years. The last Bilateral Negotiations between the
SADC Secretariat and the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany was held in
June 2017, during which, the two parties agreed to jointly support the following projects,
which are further broken down in Table 12.

SADC – World Bank Cooperation

(23).

SADC and the World Bank are working together in a number of mutual areas of interest
including infrastructure, disaster risk management, trade and industrialization, at both
national, regional and tripartite (SADC/COMESA/EAC) levels. The objective of SADC is
to explore the opportunities to further enhance cooperation with the World Bank, and to
negotiate and lay the basis for a programme to support SADC priorities.

(24).

A SADC – World Bank Group Dialogue was held in December 2017 to discuss Next
Steps on the Industrialization Strategy & Roadmap and possibility of cooperation in the
Value Chain development in the SADC region. The World Bank committed to support
SADC in these areas.

(25).

In addition, SADC regularly participates in the Annual and Spring Meetings of the World
Bank/IMF in Washington DC. The last Spring Meeting was held in April 2018, during
which SADC advocated for more engaged cooperation with the World Bank in the area
of Industrialisation, Infrastructure, Agriculture, Water, HIV&AIDS, amongst others. along
with the tripartite initiatives aiming at bringing together the three RECs
(SADC/COMESA/EAC) and the World Bank to review the status of the Tripartite
programmes and World Bank support to regional integration in the sub-region, and
explore ways to accelerate their implementation through better coordination between the
RECs on one side and enhanced support of the World Bank and other Development
Partners on the other.

(26).

Currently, the World Bank IDA active portfolio of regional projects to support regional
integration in SADC amounts to US$1.8 billion for 10 projects in transport, energy, ICT,
and agriculture.

6.5

SADC – China Cooperation

(27).

SADC and China cooperation is guided by the Forum on China–Africa Cooperation
(FOCAC) Action Plan outlining cooperation in political, economic, social development,
cultural and security areas, as well as the SADC priorities outlined in the Revised RISDP
2015-2020.

(28).

Under the economic cooperation of FOCAC framework, industry partnering and industrial
development capacity, infrastructure development, energy and natural resources,
investment and economic cooperation, trade, agriculture and food security, ocean
economy and tourism are aligned with SADC strategic frameworks, namely the SADC
Industrialisation Strategy and Roadmap (2015-2063), the Regional Infrastructure
Development Master Plan (RIDMP) and the Regional Agriculture Policy (RAP).

(29).

The Secretariat attends regularly the Ministerial meeting and Summit of the Forum on
China–Africa Cooperation (FOCAC). During the Johannesburg Summit in November
2016, the Chinese government announced some US$60 billion of funding support to
Africa over the next three years. The next Summit is scheduled in Beijing in September
2018.
69

-----------------------Page 76 End-----------------------

(30).

In a bid to enhance SADC-China Cooperation, the Secretariat is in consultation with the
Chinese government and negotiating a Framework Agreement on Economy, Trade,
Investment and Technical Cooperation between SADC and the Government of the
People’s Republic. The SADC Secretariat has submitted the draft MOU with inputs from
Member States to the Government of the People’s Republic of China in 2017, and the
MOU is awaiting finalization subject to confirmation from the Chinese side.

(31).

Negotiations are also ongoing to concretize cooperation in the area of Peace and
Security.

6.6

Japan Cooperation

(32).

As a follow-up to the policy level dialogue between the SADC Secretariat and the
Government of Japan in November 2015, the Secretariat is in the process of engaging
with Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) to concretize the proposal for the
appointment of a Japanese Technical Advisor to be posted within the Directorate of
Infrastructure and Services, to facilitate access to TICAD Resources on infrastructure
development. The proposal is to support SADC in the priority areas outlined in the
Revised RISDP (2015-2020) and the Regional Infrastructure Development Master Plan
(RIDMP), in line with the Fifth Tokyo International Conference on African Development
(TICAD V) which emphasizes the importance of regional infrastructure development for
accelerating economic growth in Africa, and as outlined in the Yokohama Action Plan
2013-2017 (YAP 2013-2017).

(33).

The Application Form for a JICA Expert was submitted to the Embassy of Japan in July
2017. JICA has informed that the Expert has been identified, and the official dispatch is
pending approval.

(34).

It is worth noting that Japan is also already supporting a regional project on Forest
Conservation and Sustainable Management of Forest Resources in Southern Africa
through a grant of $6.4 million, mainly for technical assistance, which includes expertise
in Forestry.

6.7

SADC – African Development Bank Cooperation

(35).

Since 2016, SADC has engaged the African Development Bank (AfDB) to help
accelerate its Regional Integration Agenda through financing of the implementation of
the SADC regional infrastructure and economic corridors, (i.e. combination of regional
infrastructure and value chains).

(36).

The AfDB also continues to provide support for the implementation of programmes in the
SADC region through bi-lateral cooperation with individual SADC Member States and
cooperation with the Secretariat for regional programmes. In this regard, the Secretariat
engaged the AfDB at both technical level and policy level to explore cooperation in the
context of the Bank’s High Five Initiatives in line with the SADC regional priorities, as
outlined in the Revised RISDP (2015-2020) and the Regional Infrastructure Development
Master Plan (RIDMP).
70

-----------------------Page 77 End-----------------------

(37).

A number of Council and Summit Decisions, especially since the holding of the SADC
Strategic Ministerial Retreat: “The SADC We Want”, which was held in the margins of
the Extraordinary Summit on 12-14 March 2017 in Ezulwini, Eswatini, call for support
from the AfDB to SADC in order to fast-track the implementation of SADC programmes
and projects. Key decisions include, among others, directing the Secretariat to work with
AfDB to develop the necessary instruments and frameworks for use in Member States,
in complementarity with the development of the SADC Regional Resources Mobilisation
Framework including in:
i.
ii.
iii.
iv.
v.

Infrastructure Bonds;
Partial Risk Guarantees;
Insurance Guarantees;
Partial Credit Guarantees; and
Syndicated Instruments.

(38).

At the sidelines of the Africa-European Union Summit, held in Abidjan, Cote D’Ivoire in
November 2017, key meetings were also held between the Executive Secretary of the
SADC and the Bank’s senior management. These meetings resulted in the re-affirmation
of the areas of support as well as the need for the Bank to send a technical mission to
SADC, which took place in January 2018.

(39).

As an outcome of the Mission, an Aide Memoire highlighting the agreed areas of support
was finalized and signed by the Executive Secretary and AfDB represented by the Acting
Director General, Southern Africa Regional Development and Business Delivery Office
in March 2018, and a Work Plan has been developed for the implementation of the
agreed areas.

6.8

SADC – ICP Dialogue Platform

(40).

The last SADC-ICP Dialogue Platform Meeting was held in October 2017. The objective
of the meeting was to provide updates on the achievements made in the SADC-ICP
Thematic Working Groups to assess whether set goals and targets were met as well as
to share best practices with the Dialogue Platform in order to seek support at strategic
level for resolution of challenges.

(41).

The meeting exchanged notes on the state of implementation of key strategic
frameworks in the context of the outcomes of the March 2017 Ministerial Retreat “the
SADC We Want”, and the 37th SADC Summit of Heads of State and Governments of
August 2017; as well as on the operationalization of the SADC Non-State Actors
Engagement Mechanism and the SADC Private Sector Engagement Mechanism.

(42).

As outlined in the adopted SADC-ICP Partnership Statement and Generic Terms of
Reference for the Platform and Thematic Groups, engagement with ICPs has also
continued through Thematic Group Coordination meetings where the Secretariat meets
with interested ICPs working in specific sectors to facilitate information sharing and to
ensure effective utilisation of resources and minimise duplication of support programmes
and complementarity of support.

GOOD GOVERNANCE

7.1

Risk Management

(1).

7.2

Risk Management continues to be an important pillar of governance for the Secretariat,
and Management has continued to promote and support effective enterprise-wide risk
management through capacity building and training of staff. In this regard, sixty
employees in Head Office, and all employees at SPGRC and RPTC (except Secretaries)
were trained on risk management. Further, a Strategic Risk Register and an Operational
risk register have been developed and approved, and implementation of risk
management plan was monitored throughout the year.

Audit

(2).

The Secretariat continued to facilitate internal audits to foster good governance. In this
regard, 8 Internal Audit Reports and one investigation report have been concluded.

(3).

The Secretariat also continued to implement recommendations from both external and
internal audits as well as the institutional audit in order to bring improvements in the
management of systems of the Secretariat, in particular strengthening of the internal
control environment. The effectiveness of the control environment allowed the
Secretariat to continue benefiting from ICP resources through contribution agreements
and projects.

8.
(1).

Implementation Challenges
The challenges that affected effective implementation of SADC programmes include:
i.

Capacity gaps in monitoring and evaluation at Directorates/Units level to facilitate
timely corrective actions during the course of programmes’ implementation;

ii.

The existing recruitment systems (The quota points system does not facilitate
efficiency and quick turnaround times) affected the filling in of vacant positions
resulting in slow implementation of programmes.

iii.

In order to address these challenges, the following measures were undertaken:

iv.

Annual trainings on results based management and project cycle management
which will contribute to strengthening of planning, monitoring and evaluation
capacity of Directorates/Units;

v.

Continued training of SADC Secretariat Staff on the use of all automated
management systems will enhance compliance and efficiency.

Conclusion and Recommendations

(1).

The report has highlighted some significant achievements in the implementation of
programmes across all priority areas during 2017/18. Of particular importance is the
general political stability in the region underpinned by mediation and conflict prevention
strategies undertaken by the Member States in collaboration with the Secretariat and
other stakeholders in the DRC, Lesotho and Madagascar. The consolidation of
democracy was also an important milestone for the year that resulted in peaceful,
credible and transparent elections in Angola and Lesotho. The support provided by the
SADC Electoral Observer Mission (SEOM) with the assistance of the SADC Electoral
Advisory Council (SEAC) in this regard is expected to be extended to the Democratic
Republic of Congo, Republics of Madagascar, Zimbabwe and the Kingdom of Eswatini
during the 2018 elections.

(2).

Involvement of the private sector during the Popularization of the Industrialization
Strategy marked a significant step towards implementation of the Action Plan. The
Secretariat is geared to continue involving the private sector in the implementation of the
Action Plan particularly the value chains across all sectors.

(3).

Progress was also made in the area of agriculture, where the Agricultural Development
Fund was approved to boost the performance of the agricultural sector, which is a key
driver of industrialization in the region. The Secretariat will continue to facilitate the
operationalization of the ADF in 2018/19. With regards to Social and Human
Development, notable achievements were in education, health, labour and youth sectors.
In Education, achievements were in the mainstreaming of the impact of HIV and AIDS in
the Education sector; domestication and monitoring of the implementation of Continental
and International Commitments on education in particular the Continental Education
Strategy for Africa; and the establishment of regional mechanism for coordinating the
implementation of the SADC Qualification Framework. With regard to health, there have
been significant efforts by the Member States to improve the status of health in the SADC
region through the development of an implementation Plan for the SADC Strategy on
Nutrition and implementation of measures to eliminate Malaria in the region.

(4).

The Secretariat will continue to mobilize financial resources to support implementation
of programmes across sectors to support industrialization and to ensure poverty
alleviation. Support will also be given to Member States to monitor and evaluate the
implementation of the SADC programmes through the SADC Online Monitoring and
Evaluation System.
