MESSAGE FROM THE
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR
Year on year, millions of women and adolescents in
155 countries and territories have been progressively
able to exercise their sexual and reproductive health
and rights. This is in no small measure as a result of
UNFPA programmes and activities.

to claim their rights, with a priority focus on supporting

The UNFPA strategic plan for 2014-2017 set ambitious
targets for increasing access to sexual and reproductive
health services, including—and especially—in parts of the
world strangled by war or devastated by natural disasters.

Last year, the UNFPA Executive Board endorsed our

These services have empowered millions of women to
make their own decisions about whether, when or how
often to become pregnant. They have enabled millions
of teenagers to avoid unplanned pregnancy, and to make
safe and healthy transitions to adulthood. And they have
slowed the unnecessary and cruel tide of maternal death.
UNFPA-supported initiatives have touched a remarkable
number of people’s lives. Contraceptives provided by
UNFPA between 2014 and 2017, for example, helped
avert 49 million unintended pregnancies, 15 million
unsafe abortions and 125,000 maternal deaths. Through
its advocacy in this period, nearly 9,000 communities
abandoned female genital mutilation, sparing more than
800,000 girls from this harmful practice.
Yet, the world is still far from perfect for women and
girls. There is still much that needs to be done. And so
despite its impressive achievements, UNFPA continues
its journey of reaching those who have not yet been able

those left furthest behind first. Untold millions are still
at risk of unintended pregnancy, death in pregnancy
or childbirth, or practices that keep girls from realizing
their full potential. In 2018, this is simply unacceptable.

next strategic plan, for 2018–2021, which aims to reach
those who have been left behind. The new plan strives
for three results that will be truly transformative for
the lives of women and girls: to end unmet demand
for family planning, preventable maternal death, and
gender-based violence, including harmful practices
such as child marriage and female genital mutilation,
by 2030, the same year the United Nations Sustainable
Development Goals are to be achieved. Ensuring
that high-quality population data underpins these
transformative results, through a geo-referenced
Population Data Platform, will enable us to deliver on
our strategic plan.
In 2018 and beyond, UNFPA will, therefore, allocate
the bulk of its resources towards these transformative
results and will use high-quality population data to
document where progress is being made and to show
where additional efforts are needed. We will not stop
until every woman and every girl, across the globe, has
the power, information and means to shape her own
destiny. A cause worth fighting for, and a mandate
UNFPA defends every day, everywhere.

PREGNANCY BY CHOICE,

Access to safe, voluntary family planning is a human right and is central to achieving gender equality,
empowering women and reducing poverty. UNFPA helps ensure steady supplies of high-quality contraceptives.

SAVING
MOTHERS’ LIVES
Affordable, high-quality reproductive health services save lives. Maternal deaths are decreasing rapidly in
developing countries, particularly in the least-developed ones. Between 2014 and 2017, UNFPA-supported
integrated sexual and reproductive health services, including skilled birth attendance, reached more than
58 million people.

AFRICA, EAST AND SOUTHERN

Services supported by UNFPA reached millions of women and young people in East and
Southern Africa between 2014 and 2017. In 2017 alone through a programme funded by the
United Kingdom to prevent maternal deaths in the region, UNFPA helped 3.4 million people access family
planning and trained about 6,000 health workers to provide a wider range of contraceptive options and
information about their safe use.
UNFPA in 2017 also invested in integrated HIV and sexual and reproductive health services in Southern
Africa, which has the world’s highest HIV infection rates. In the Great Lakes region and in other crisisaffected areas, UNFPA provided maternal health care and support for survivors of gender-based violence.
Also, UNFPA is supporting comprehensive sexuality education programmes in all countries in the region.

AFRICA, WEST AND CENTRAL

UNFPA empowered the region’s women and young people between 2014 and 2017
through improved sexual and reproductive health services and increased access to
family planning. Investments strengthened countries’ capacities to provide and distribute reproductive
health supplies. In 2016, for example, UNFPA invested about $33 million in contraceptives.
UNFPA also invested in developing the region’s biggest asset: its young people. These investments
supported initiatives to foster youth participation, with partners such as the African Youth and Adolescent
Network on Population and Development, in policymaking and development planning, and to create
synergies among UNFPA programmes. Efforts are also under way to realize and maximize a demographic
dividend by scaling up investments in the human capital of the region’s young people.

Between 2014 and 2017, UNFPA advocated integrating sexual and reproductive
health into national health policies and systems with an emphasis on strengthening
services that prevent maternal deaths. It also advocated for the inclusion of reproductive
rights in governments’ human rights policies.
UNFPA programmes in the Arab States engaged governments, community leaders and civil society
organizations in efforts to end harmful practices such as child marriage and female genital mutilation.
Using data collected through focus groups and other means, UNFPA also responded to women’s and girls’
needs for sexual and reproductive health services and services to address gender-based violence. Regional
programmes have sought to reinforce the role of young men and women in policymaking and engage them
in promoting peace and security.

UNFPA programmes in Asia and the Pacific between 2014 and 2017 helped reduce
maternal deaths, address unmet need for family planning and tackle gender-based
violence and harmful practices against women and girls.
As part of these efforts, UNFPA supported the training of midwives who have been deployed to
underserved areas of Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Cambodia, Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Myanmar,
Mongolia and Nepal, resulting in a dramatic reduction in maternal deaths.
Advocacy contributed to increased access to family planning and strengthened responses to child
marriage. Services in humanitarian settings helped meet the sexual and reproductive health needs
of vulnerable women and girls and address gender-based violence.

EASTERN EUROPE AND CENTRAL ASIA

In Eastern Europe and Central Asia, a region of middle-income countries, UNFPA helped
governments develop or implement policies to ensure that all people, including the most
vulnerable, can realize their right to sexual and reproductive health.
Other actions in the region helped break down barriers that young people face in accessing sexual and
reproductive health information and services, supported national efforts to eradicate gender-based
violence and harmful practices and strengthened national capacities for collecting, analysing and using
data for policymaking.

LATIN AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN

UNFPA programmes in Latin America and the Caribbean between 2014 and 2017 helped
bolster culturally sensitive, youth-friendly sexual and reproductive health services,
ensure reliable reproductive health and family planning supplies, including long-acting
reversible contraceptives, for women and young people. Other actions helped extend maternal
health services, including midwifery, to indigenous communities and build institutional capacities to
address gender-based violence. UNFPA’s evidence-based advocacy influenced policies and strengthened
capacities to address gender-based violence and helped reduce child marriage.

PARTNERSHIPS

Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation
UNFPA partnered with the Bill & Melinda Gates
Foundation, the United Kingdom Department
for International Development and WorldPop/
Flowminder to harness the power of spatial
reference technology to help Afghanistan collect
population data from all areas of the country,
including those that have been hard to reach
because of security concerns.

Johnson & Johnson
With support from Johnson & Johnson, UNFPA
is helping reduce maternal deaths in Haiti and
Liberia by increasing the number and capacity of
skilled birth attendants and improving linkages
between local communities and maternal health
services. At the Marigot maternity clinic, one of
five obstetric and newborn care centres supported
by Johnson & Johnson in Haiti, midwives provide
free maternal health services.
