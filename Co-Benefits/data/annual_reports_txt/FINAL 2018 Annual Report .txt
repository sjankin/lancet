Regional Response Summary 2018

HIGHLIGHTS ACROSS THE REGION
BRIDGE. OUTSOURCE. TRANSFORM
– IMPACT SOURCING PLATFORM FOR YOUTH

ILO’S WORKPLACE
ADAPTATION TRAINING

UNICEF and Digital Oppurtunity Trust (DOT) Lebanon developed
an impact sourcing platform - Bridge. Outsource. Transform.
(“B.O.T.”) - to tackle high youth unemployment in Lebanon. B.O.T.
matches marginalized youth in Lebanon, who have been trained
with digital skills through UNICEF’s Generation of Innovation
Leaders (GIL) program, with online income-generatingopportunities. During its pilot phase, 125 young adults earned
approximately USD 60,000 on the platform. In addition, B.O.T.
won the recent Global Social Venture Competition in the region
in partnership with BeryTech (Business Innovation & Incubation
Center in Lebanon for Entrepreneurs). It will now participate in
the next stage, a Global Round competing against social startups from all around the world.

The International Labour Organization (ILO) implemented a
“Workplace Adaptation Training” programme to support the
integration of Syrian refugees into host communities and for
Turkish national workers to become more understanding and
accepting of Syrian refugees and their situation. Some 150
beneficiaries in 16 workplaces have so far benefitted from the
programme. Challenges related to work permits and language
barriers are constantly cited as the key obstacles to access to
employment for refugees, and this programme also seeks to
address these issues.

BLOCKCHAIN IN JORDAN

MEETING FOR A RENEWED RESILIENCE COMMITMENT
A ‘Meeting for a Renewed Resilience Commitment’ was
held in April in Amman prior to the Brussels II Conference.
Participants re-affirmed their commitment to stronger and
effective resilience-based programming in supporting affected
individuals, communities and institutions. Participants included
Government representatives from Lebanon and Jordan,
members of diplomatic missions, UN Agencies, NGOs and CSO’s
and think tanks.

Based on the success of the Building Blocks pilot project
launched in 2017, WFP-Jordan has expanded the use of
blockchain technology to deliver humanitarian assistance to
110,000 Syrian refugees in Azraq and Zaatari refugee camps,
enhancing the delivery of cash-based transfers (CBT). By the
end of the year, a total of USD 39 million was transferred to
beneficiaries using Blockchain. This technology has enabled
WFP to provide CBT assistance in a more efficient and less costly
manner. In 2019, WFP is planning to expand the use of Building
Blocks to reach Syrian refugees in host communities.

SOCIAL INNOVATION LABS
In 2018, UNICEF Jordan scaled-up its social
innovation labs programme, expanding its
reach from 30,000 to 90,000 young people
through the establishment of an additional
43 physical labs in Makani centres. At the
labs, UNICEF’s “UPSHIFT” curriculum is
implemented, which aims to help young
identify the biggest challenges they are
facing in their communities and coming up
with innovative ventures to address these
challenges. The labs also serve as a positive
learning environment for unstructured
activities, and some labs offer technical
training in robotics, creative media, and
coding.

Regional Response Summary 2018

AN INNOVATIVE RESPONSE BOOSTING RESILIENCE
IN TURKEY’S HEALTH SECTOR

The Ministry of Health of Turkey (MoH), supported by WHO, the
European Union, health sector partners and other humanitarian
actors, has led a country-wide response aimed at strengthening
refugee-sensitive health service delivery. The programme
aims to provide linguistic- and culturally-sensitive primary
healthcare services for the Syrian population. The programme
has established a network of Migrant Health Centres (MHCs)
across the country where Syrian doctors and nurses offer health
services to other fellow Syrians.
Within this scheme, WHO and MoH began to train Syrian doctors
and nurses to serve in the Turkish health care system across the
network of MHCs. The training programme, aimed at teaching
Syrian health care workers how to navigate the system, consists
of a one-week theoretical training and a six-week on-the-job
training. During the practical stage, Syrian health care workers
are guided and supervised by Turkish health care workers while
providing health care services in seven Refugee Health Training
Centres across the country.
In 2018, over 580,000 primary health care consultations were
provided in the seven Refugee Health Training Centres, relating
to immunization, maternal care and child health care. Some
234 Syrian doctors, 308 Syrian nurses and 629 interpreters/
patient guides were trained; and, some 1,357 Syrian health
professionals are currently employed by Ministry of Health and
serving in Migration Health Centres across the country.

STRENGTHENING NATIONAL LEADERSHIP AS THE
RESPONSE EVOLVES IN IRAQ
As the response continues to evolve in Iraq, from an emergency
to a longer-term solutions and development approach, a
number of measures have been taken to gradually shift the
response from 3RP partner-led activities to government-led
activities, supported by 3RP partners. In 2018, this includes
capacity building and partnership between UNHCR and
government entities, such as child protection training for
Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs (MoLSA)/ Directorates of
Social Affairs (DoSA) staff, and Gender Based Violence (GBV)
prevention and response training for staff of the General
Directorate of combating violence against women (DCVAW).
Going forward, this transition will also see existing refugee
camps transform into viable settlements, and the gradual
inclusion of Syrian refugees into the existing national systems
and services.

PERCEPTIONS OF SOCIAL TENSIONS IN LEBANON
In 2018, the Social Stability sector in Lebanon generated a tool
that allowed the results of the UNDP/ARK Group perception
surveys on social tensions to be shared with partners in
an easily accessible way. The platform is designed to offer
quantitative data on host community-refugee relations in
a tailored format for humanitarian and development
practitioners and decision-makers. It presents data from all
four iterations of data collection and includes maps so that
Information regarding specific sectors is easily accessible. The
dashboard is accessible though the following link: http://tiny.

Regional Response Summary 2018

3RP Strategic Directions
The eight strategic directions continued to guide the response across the region in 2018. Progress was made against each of the strategic
directions, including:

♦	 Strong National Leadership remaining the cornerstone of the
response, with national governments and local/municipal
authorities continuing to lead the response. They took on a more
prominent role in some areas, such as the Government of Egypt
including its requirements in the 3RP Egypt chapter for the first
time.

♦	 The partners also continue supporting the No Lost Generation
(NLG) initiative to ensure that children and youth affected by the
Syria crisis were provided with safety and access to education.
Education partners continue providing not only access to formal
and no-formal education but also quality provided to the refugee
and vulnerable host community children.

♦	 Critical work related to verification and updating registration
records, ensuring access to civil status documentation (such
as birth certificates) and addressing SGBV continued under the
Regional Protection Framework.

♦	 3RP partners remained committed to outreach and partnerships,
including regular dialogue with International Financial Institutions
and the private sector.

♦	 Partners continued implementing resilience-based interventions
for individual refugees and host communities as well as
municipalities and host institutions. Despite only receiving 37
per cent funding of resilience component request, nearly 14,000
education personnel were provided with incentives and over 2,500
Syrian and Turkish health care professionals were provided with
training, the majority of whom were women. Partners also worked
closely with municipalities to improve the provision of basic
services such as garbage collection, community infrastructure
(such as sustainable water provision) as well as helping to increase
the capacities of municipalities.

♦	 Accountability mechanisms were strengthened, including
mechanisms for two-way communications with communities,
through focus groups, hotlines, surveys and other tools to gather
feedback and ensure beneficiaries can participate meaningfully.
♦	 All 3RP countries and the regional level have functioning
coordination mechanisms in place to discuss Durable Solutions
and develop the strategic and operational response presented in
the 2019 3RP.

♦	 Enhancing economic opportunities: The governments continued
providing work permits for refugees to facilitate access to
employment; In Jordan and Turkey, over 45,000 and 14,000 work
permits were issued respectively in 2018. To complement this,
3RP partners undertook a wide range of activities to improve the
employability of host community members and Syrian refugees,
including through trainings, internship, and work placements.

ASSISTING PALESTINE REFUGEES FROM SYRIA
Palestine refugees, including Palestine refugees from Syria (PRS),
remain amongst the most vulnerable groups in Lebanon and
Jordan, suffering the protracted effects of poverty, unemployment
and a number of legal and protection issues, reflected in high
levels of marginalization and vulnerability. During 2018, through
its emergency programmes in Lebanon, UNRWA provided services
including cash assistance (in cooperation with WFP), emergency
health, education and protection, livelihoods and psychosocial
support, as well as environmental health to more than 28,800 PRS.
Some of the most vulnerable Palestine refugees in Lebanon (PRL)
were also encompassed in the Agency’s emergency programmes
and benefited from winterization support, protection and
environmental health services amongst others, as a way of
supporting the whole community.

The Government of Turkey has continued its strong national ownership of the
response through the implementation of the Temporary Protection Regulation.
The registration of Syrians continued in 2018, with the registration information of
majority of Syrians being verified. Numbers in urban areas have increased in 2018
with the closure and decongestion of Temporary Accommodation Centres (TACs)
and the relocation of 45,000 Syrian refugees. With the support of 3RP partners,
Syrians under temporary protection have been granted increasing access to national
systems including health, education, employment and social services.
The enrollment of Syrian children in formal education has increased to 640,000 and
regular school attendance has been promoted through continuing complementary
services including the Conditional Cash Transfer for Education (CCTE). Supporting
the estimated 400,000 out of school children with relevant education programmes
continues to be a main focus of the education sector. Partners have supported
education provision from pre-primary to higher education. Scholarships for higher
education are key for self-sufficiency. Continued self-reliance was also made
possible through increased access of Syrians to formal employment opportunities
through job creation, job placement, and trainings including language, vocational
and skills training.

for job creation, as well as promoting social stability. Progress
has been made to scale up and increase absorption capacity of
activities and in 2018, 3RP partners reached over 60,000 Turkish
and Syrian individuals and placed 3,500 into jobs, with another
1,200 supported to start a business. Support to municipalities’
service provision has also continued through strengthened
technical capacities towards increased accessibility of services,
with over USD 25 million mobilized across sectors to support
municipal services, notably on waste management, waste water
and emergency services in southeast municipalities facing the

Health Counselling Units. Protection focus on specialized services has continued
prioritizing women and children at risk, and included response activities to GBV,
psychosocial needs, and access to legal assistance.

There has been an effort to enhance the capacities of localized national service
providers, including Social Service Centres and other centres operating under the
Ministry of Family, Labour and Social Services. This has furthered identification
of Syrians with specific needs, referrals to and from service providers as well as
outreach activities. Service provision at the provincial level has been enhanced
through provincial coordination platforms such as Case-management Working
Groups. Supporting efforts to enhance social cohesion activities also remains a key
area of focus.

contributed to meeting the various basic needs of Syrians. However, rising prices
due to global trends and high inflation levels in 2018 have exacerbated the effects of
low income levels of refugees. Vulnerable Syrians under temporary protection cope
with the situation by reducing diversity and quality of food consumption.

LEBANON SITUATION MAP
Syrian Refugees
(As of 31 December 2018)

Since 2017, the response to the multifaceted ramifications of the Syrian crisis has
been guided by a revised Lebanon Crisis Response Plan (LCRP), jointly developed by
the humanitarian community (United Nations, national and international NGOs and
donors) and the Government of Lebanon (GoL) and covering a multi-year period up
to 2020. It provides an integrated humanitarian and stabilization framework, aiming
to tackle Lebanon’s challenges holistically, taking into account the vulnerability of
all people affected by the crisis.

The response aims, on the one hand, the response aims to ensure protection and
provide immediate assistance to the most vulnerable populations, primarily the
displaced population from Syria, the host community, the Palestine refugees in
Lebanon and from Syria, while at the same time, strengthening the capacity of
national and local service delivery systems to expand access to and quality of basic
services. It also reinforces Lebanon’s economic, social and environmental stability.
2018 marked the second year of the four-year plan. 3.3 million individuals were
identified as in need of assistance and 2.8 million were specifically targeted by
implementing partners. The total outreach for 2018 was 1.6 million individuals
effectively benefitting from the response. Funding shortages remain an obstacle and,
Particularly note, multi-year funding remains limited and sectors like Livelihoods,
Shelter and Energy continue to struggle. Nonetheless, in 2018 some USD 474
million (34 per cent of total funding available by the Lebanon response in 2018) was
injected into the local economy by LCRP partners through cash-based interventions.
In addition, the amount of funding channelled through public institutions has
increased, strengthening service delivery, policy development, capacity building and
institutional stability. In 2017 more than USD 202 million (17 per cent of the overall
funding received for the Response) was channeled through public institutions; this
support has increased by 17 per cent in 2018, to USD 236 million.
The situation remains precarious, with many refugees continuing to rely on
assistance to survive. This is particularly relevant for female-headed households
which, despite some improvements in food security and other vulnerability
indicators, remain more vulnerable than male-headed households. Persons
living with disabilities face considerable challenges to access livelihoods and
services autonomously. Children are among the most vulnerable, in particular
unaccompanied children or those separated from their families. 3RP partners
have been able to mitigate the deterioration of vulnerabilities, but not halt them
completely.

Syrians in Jordan, which mean that Syrians are now required to pay 80 per cent of the
applicable standard pricing for foreigners. This represents a huge change in pricing, with
far reaching implications on refugees’ ability to access healthcare and general wellbeing.
Economic stresses have also affected food prices; government cuts to subsidies on bread
and increased taxation have been acutely felt in a country where more than half a million
Syrian refugees are in need of food assistance. In response, the Food Security Sector
assessed the impact of these measures and increased the value of food baskets and cashbased transfers to Syrian refugees in host communities.

On 15 October 2018, the Jaber-Nasib border crossing between Jordan and Syria reopened for the first time in three years, facilitating the reopening of an important trade
route. Refugees have returned to Syria from Jordan in small numbers throughout the
conflict. During 2018, particularly after the border reopening, increased focus was
placed on return. However, while refugee return figures may have increased slightly since
the border was reopened, returns still represent a very small number in comparison to the

IRAQ SITUATION MAP
Syrian Refugees
(As of 31 December 2018)

Despite the challenging political climate in the Iraq context, the protection
environment in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq (KR-I), where 99 per cent of the
Syrian refugees in Iraq reside, remained favourable in 2018. Syrian refugees were
assisted with registration and legal assistance, including support for the issuance
of residency permits. The absence of a legal framework for refugee protection,
however, continues to preclude longer-term residency rights to remain and other
legal benefits for Syrian refugees.

Despite the favourable protection environment, the lack of access to livelihood
opportunities, diminishing resources, and reduced humanitarian assistance,
resulted in increased risk of SGBV for refugee women, girls, and to lesser extent men
and boys. Child labour and child marriage are among the main causes for children
dropping out of school. Case management (including capacity building) continued
to be central in GBV-prevention and Child Protection response.
The economic situation has continued to deteriorate, negatively affecting the
livelihoods opportunities of Iraqis and Syrians alike. Access to healthcare, basic
necessities, and adequate shelter remains challenging, mainly for refugee families
living outside camps. Identified vulnerable households in urban areas received
multi-purpose cash assistance, which is used to purchase food, repay debt, and pay
for healthcare and rent. In camps, vulnerable households received food assistance.
WASH and Shelter interventions mostly focused on the maintenance and repair of
the infrastructure and the upgrade of shelters inside camps.
The protracted presence of Syrian refugees in Iraq has stretched the existing public
services. Shortage of medicines and medical supplies remains a key concern for
the provision of basic healthcare. The health sector managed to bring this issue to
the attention of donors which resulted in improvements toward the end of 2018.
In education, the lack financial incentives for refugee school teachers remained
a critical area of concern in the second part of 2018 and jeopardized access to
qualitative education.
Resettlement opportunities and alternative pathways remained limited in Iraq and
Iraq did not experience large-scale return movements in 2018.

EGYPT SITUATION MAP
Syrian Refugees
(As of 31 December 2018)

As of the end of 2018, UNHCR Egypt has registered a total of 244,919 refugees and
asylum seekers, out of which 132,871 are Syrians (54% of the active population).
21,443 of the Syrian refugees in Egypt are individuals with specific needs. Syrian
refugees continued to have access to public education and health services at an
equal level of Egyptian nationals. Nevertheless, the government has stretched its
capacity to maintain a conducive asylum space and to allow national institutions to
absorb and respond to the increasing demand on public services.

In 2018, underfunding remained a major challenge for UNHCR and appealing
agencies in meeting the pressing needs of the refugee population. With roughly
50% funding, UNHCR and 3RP partners continued to respond to the needs of Syrian
refugees in the five sectors of assistance: Protection, Education, Basic Needs and
Livelihoods, Health and Food Security.
By the end of 2018, almost 70,000 Syrian children, youth and adolescents have
accessed protection-related assistance such as participation in community based
psychosocial support and child protection activities, benefitting from multisectoral case management, activities on SGBV prevention and response and
referral to legal partners for assistance. In addition, 1,647 Syrian refugees have been
submitted for resettlement to third countries in 2018. With the collaboration of WFP,
over 77,000 vulnerable Syrian refugees have received food vouchers on a monthly
basis. Moreover, UNHCR supported an average of 45,618 Syrian refugees with multipurpose cash assistance during 2018. Furthermore, UNHCR provided a total of
27,379 Syrian refugee households with winter assistancem, and UNICEF assisted an
additional 760 unaccompanied and separated children (UASC). In Egypt, education
partners contributed to achieving the No Lost Generation initiative by providing
education grants to 25,800 Syrian refugee children at the age of 6-20 years old and
approximately 5,000 grants to Syrian refugee children at the age of 3-5. In addition,
and in collaboration with the Egyptian Ministry of Health and Population (MoHP),
over 120,000 Syrian refugee women, men and children have benefited from primary
health consultations, including 5,032 refugees benefiting from medication for
chronic health problems.

While access to formal work opportunities remains a challenge to Syrian refugees
and host communities in Egypt, UNHCR and partners under the 3RP continued
to provide access to alternative livelihood opportunities and to foster resilience
among communities. In light of this, Livelihood partners provided capacity
development support for livelihood purposes to over 2,700 male and female Syrian
refugees. On the resilience component, 3RP partners continued to strengthen the
institutional capacity of the host government in various ministries. By the end of
2018, more than 250 public health facilities were supported with equipment, over
2,000 female and male teachers have been trained under the Ministry of Education
and more than 250 government staff were trained on Child Protection.
