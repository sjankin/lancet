SAARC DEVELOPMENT FUND

Message from the Chairman
Consolidated Annual Report for the years 2016 and 2017
I am honored to submit the consolidated Annual Report for the years 2016
and 2017 to the Governing Council of SDF.
This report highlights SDF’s continued commitment towards promoting
the welfare of the people of SAARC Region, improving the quality of
life, accelerating economic growth and social progress, and alleviating of
poverty through financing and implementation of development projects in
all the SAARC Member States.
Despite significant progress, much remains to be done as the SAARC Development Fund continues with
its mandate to build regional integration through project funding.
With the above stated mandate, the SAARC Development Fund Secretariat operates through the three
financing windows: Social, Economic and Infrastructure. Currently, SDF has approved 14 projects with over
80 Implementing Agencies under the Social window and 5 projects under the Economic and Infrastructure
windows (including 2 in-principle approved projects) with Currently, SDF is implementing 90 projects in all
SAARC Member States under its Social, Economic and Infrastructure funding windows with a total fund
commitment/allocation of USD 198.24 million including the MSME Program with fund allocation of USD
50 million in SAARC Member States.
The regional projects include strengthening the livelihood of home-based workers, addressing the needs
of farmers, reducing the mother and child mortality, delivering connectivity and content of e-governance
to rural folks, ending violence against children and women, and improving the sanitation in the SAARC
region. These projects are successfully implemented through 67 lead implementing agencies/coordinating
agencies under the Social Window. With the recent activation of our Economic and Infrastructure Windows,
SDF aims to foster synergies across the region to fund projects related to energy, power, transportation,
tourism and other infrastructural areas.
Regional cooperation and integration, the process by which SAARC Member States become more
interconnected regionally, is critical in promoting the wellbeing of the people of South Asia. Hence, I would
like to acknowledge the Board of Directors, staff and our esteemed partners of the SAARC Development
Fund who made everything we do possible. We are grateful for their support in transforming SDF into a
more dynamic and innovative regional funding institution for the people in SAARC Member States.

Message from the
Chief Executive Officer
It is a great honor for me to present the Annual Report of the SAARC
Development Fund (SDF) for 2016 and 2017. This Annual Report
provides an insight into SDF’s growing presence across the SAARC
region through project-based collaboration.
SDF was established in April 2010 to promote regional integration
and economic cooperation. To realize this mission, we at the SDF
Secretariat continue to undertake a number of initiatives for the
strategic growth of the region. The last few years have offered us
new projects, partners and new interventions to enable SDF to
become a stronger regional financial institution. Currently, SDF is
implementing 90 projects in all SAARC Member States under its
Social, Economic and Infrastructure funding windows with a total
fund commitment/allocation of USD 198.24 million. 48 projects (in
7 areas) have been successfully completed to benefit thousands of

Building partnership is the key for the South Asian region to realize its full economic potential. Hence, SDF
has developed a strong relationship with various Multinational Development Banks, International Financial
Institutions, Regional Banks, MSME Banks, SME Banks, Chambers of Commerce and Industries, and
Trade and Investment Promotion Agencies. Our increased presence in South Asia reflects our unflinching
commitment to bring dividends of regional cooperation to the people at the grassroots with a view to
promoting their welfare and improving quality of their life, which is the primary objective of SAARC.
Despite challenges, we do foresee the enormous potential for project-based collaboration in achieving
overall progress and prosperity across the region for the common good of our people.
I wish to express sincere gratitude to Their Excellencies the members of the Governing Council and
the Board of Directors for their guidance and support in charting out an eventful journey for SDF during
2016-2017. I am also thankful to my colleagues at the SDF Secretariat for their continued cooperation and
support in the discharge of my responsibilities.

SAARC Development Fund
GENESIS
In 1996, SAARC created a funding mechanism, namely, ‘South Asian Development Fund’ (SADF), merging
the SAARC Fund for Regional Projects (SFRP) and the SAARC Regional Fund. SADF’s objectives were
to support industrial development, poverty alleviation, protection of environment, institutional/human
resource development and promotion of social and infrastructural development in the SAARC region.
SADF started with a resource base of US$ 5 million (contributed on a pro-rata basis by the Member States)
and till its closure in June 2008, had funds amounting to approximately US $ 7 million. SADF completed
techno-economic feasibility studies for sixteen projects.
The primary reason for establishing SDF was that the erstwhile SADF had inadequate quantum of funds
and limited scope of work. In September 2005, the Financial Experts of the Member States considered
the entire gamut of issues relating to the funding of SAARC projects and programs, and, amongst others,
recommended to reconstitute SADF into SDF, instead of proliferating sectoral financing mechanisms.
TheThirteenth SAARC Summit( Dhaka,12-13November2005) decided to reconstitute SADF into SDF to
serve as the “umbrella financial mechanism” for all SAARC projects and programs.
INTRODUCTION
The SAARC Development Fund (SDF) Secretariat was inaugurated on 28 April 2010 by the Heads of
State or Government during the Sixteenth SAARC Summit held in Thimphu, Bhutan. The Fund serves as
the umbrella financial institution of SAARC for implementing projects and programs in the attainment of
its Charter objectives. It is aimed to contribute to regional cooperation and integration through projectbased collaboration. The primary objectives of SDF are to promote welfare of the people of the SAARC

SAARC DEVELOPMENT FUND

CURRENT STATUS
SDF has an authorized capital of US $ 1.5 billion and a total capital base of US $ 511.52
million. Currently, SDF is implementing 90 projects in all SAARC Member States under
its Social, Economic and Infrastructure funding windows with a total fund commitment/
allocation of USD 198.24 million.
48 projects (in 7 areas) of the Social Window have been successfully completed to benefit
thousands of people in SAARC Member States.
Further, more than 10 bankable projects are also under active consideration of SDF for

alleviation in the region. In the accomplishment of these objectives, SDF is mandated to identify projects,
and provide financing and technical assistance for their implementation across the region through its own
resources as well as through mobilization of funds from external sources.

SAARC DEVELOPMENT FUND

Focus Areas of Funding
SDF has three funding Windows, namely, Social Window, Economic Window and Infrastructure
Window:

SOCIAL WINDOW
The Social Window primarily funds projects in poverty alleviation and social development, focusing on
education, health, human resources development, support to vulnerable/disadvantaged segments of the
society, funding needs of communities, micro-enterprises and rural infrastructure development. These
projects are inline with the consensus reflected in the SAARC Social Charter, SAARC Development Goals,
SAARC Plan of Action on Poverty Alleviation and other regional plans, programmes and instruments.

ECONOMIC WINDOW
The Economic Window primarily extends funding to non-infrastructural projects related to trade and
industrial development, agriculture, service sector, and science and technology, among others. It can also
be utilized for identifying, developing and sponsoring commercially viable programmes/projects of regional
priority, including preparing their pre-feasibility and feasibility studies. In essence, it supports any other
projects which do not fall under the Social and Infrastructure Windows.
SDF proposes to fund Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) program in the Member States
underthe MSME funding scheme within the ambit of its Economic Window.

INFRASTRUCTURE WINDOW
The Infrastructure Window is utilized primarily to fund projects in areas such as energy, power, transportation,
telecommunications, environment and tourism, among others.

Partnership – Building Strategic Alliances
SDF has established and strengthened relationship with various partners to co-finance cross-border projects
through Memoranda of Understanding. These include Multinational Development Banks, International
Financial Institutions, Regional Banks, MSME Banks, SME Banks, Chambers of Commerce and Industries,
and Trade and Investment Promotion Agencies.

Economic & Infrastructure Windows
The Economic Window of SDF extends funding to projects related to trade and industrial development,
agriculture and allied value additions, Industry/Manufacturing, Micro Irrigation and ICT, while the
Infrastructure Window funds infrastructure projects in RenewableEnergy, Water Harvesting, Forestry,
Tourism, Climate change and any other sectors approved by theBoard of Directors ofSDF.
SDF has activated its Economic and Infrastructure (E&I) Window by finalizing the E&I Guidelines and Credit
Policy. SDF is in consultation with various ministries, chambers of commerce and trade promotion bodies
to identify projects in its areas of focus. SDF is also in the process of establishing credit and syndication
relationships with regional banks and financial institutions. SDF is building its own project development
and loan processing capacities to identify, develop and implement various projects under the E&I Window.
SDF aims at funding MSME projects creating access to financial services which can in-turn boost job
creation, raise income, reduce vulnerability and increase investments in human capital in the Member
States.
SDF funds projects/programs involving one or more than one Member State with the benefits accruing to
more than one Member State.
The short-term goal of SDF will be to promote investments in the infrastructure sector in partnership with
financial institutions, which will have a bearing on the economic development of the region. However,
SDF’s long-term strategy is to deploy assets in economic and infrastructure projects to attain the SAARC
Development Goals and to facilitate commitments of the Member States towards the Sustainable
Development Goals.
Current Status of Projects in-principle approved by SDF Board of Directors in the 29th SDF Board meeting
held in Thimphu, Bhutan in 2018:
a.	 Disbursement of US $ 13 million loan to purchase new aircraft of Drukair Corporation with
Sovereign Guarantee of Royal Government of Bhutan. The project comes under tourism sector
of SDF’s Economic Window. The aircraft extends connectivity with Bangladesh, India and Nepal
and thus, promoting economic connectiviy and regional integration.
b.	 Proposal to finance  Government of Nepal for onward lending to Nepal Electricity Authority
(NEA) for Expansion of Koshi Corridor 220 kV Transmission Line Project (Sovereign Loan). This
hydroelectricity project is under the Infrastructure Window of SDF.
c.	 Proposal to co-finance 37MW Upper Trishuli Hydroelectric power plant with Hydroelectricity
Investment and Development Company (HIDCL) as the co-borrower (Loan Guaranteed by
State Owned Entities of Royal Government of Nepal). This hydroelectricity project is under the
Infrastructure Window of SDF.

CURRENT STATUS
SDF has approved 5 projects under the Economic and Infrastructure Windows (including
2 projects approved in-principle by the Board) with a fund commitment of

USD 73

million

and MSME Program with fund allocation of USD 50 million in SAARC
Member States. The cumulative fund commitment under the E&I windows including
MSME Program stands at USD 123 million. USD 13 million for purchase of
Drukair ATR aircraft has been disbused. Furthermore various bankable projects are under
active consideration in E&I Windows of SDF to co-finance in SAARC Member States.

Upcoming Programs
Funding of Micro Small and Medium Enterprises Sector Under the MSME Funding
Program
A number of initiatives are regularly being launched to strengthen the vital sector of MSMEs in the SAARC
economies.The SDF has been exploring co-funding opportunities in the SAARC Member States under its
MSME Funding Program falling under the Economic and Infrastructure Windows of SDF.
The Program seeks to bolster the efforts of the Member States in supporting their MSMEs.
The MSME-funding Program aims to encourage and boost intra-regional trade among SAARC Member
States through resource support by way of providing the Line of Credit to Financial Intermediaries (FIs) in
the SAARC Member States for further lending to MSME units in their respective countries at a concessional
rate of interest.
The program targets financial institutions/any other specialised FIs/banks in the SAARC Member States ,
which are predominantly engaged in funding MSMEs or any other specialized FI/Bank. The institution shall
be recommended by the Member States in keeping with the eligibility criteria of the Scheme, under which
the maximum quantum of the Line of Credit per Fiscal Year is US $ 10 million.

Project Development Facility (PDF)
SDF is in the process of setting up of a Project Development Cell in its Secretariat. PDF aims at developing
national and regional projects that could be funded either by SDF itself or a range of investors, including
governments and private sectors .This facility has already started exploring project ideas to be developed
into bankable projectproposals.

SAARC DEVELOPMENT FUND

SAARC Development Fund (SDF)
Notes to the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2016
1. Reporting entity
SAARC Development Fund (‘the Fund’) is established by eight member countries i.e. Islamic Republic
of Afghanistan, People’s Republic of Bangladesh, Kingdom of Bhutan, Republic of India, Republic of
Maldives, Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal, Islamic Republic of Pakistan and Democratic Socialist
Republic of Sri Lanka (‘Member States’) and is governed by its Charter duly signed on 3 August 2008.
The Fund, as per the Charter, has a Governing Council, comprising of the SAARC Ministers of Finance,
a Board of Directors, consisting of one member nominated by each member state, Secretary General of
the SAARC Secretariat or his/her representative and the Chief Executive Officer of the Fund and it also
has such officers and staff, as approved by the Governing Council.
The Fund has international character, possesses, full juridical personality and operates under the Rules,
Regulations and Bye Laws made for the purpose of the Charter by the Governing Council. As per the
Bye Laws, the Fund, its property, other assets, income and its operations and transactions shall be
exempt from all taxation and duties.
The address of the Fund is SAARC Development Fund Secretariat, 3rd Floor, BDFC Building, Norzin Lam,
Post Box 928, Thimphu 11001, Bhutan.
The Fund is established to promote the welfare of the people of its member countries, to improve their
quality of life and to accelerate economic growth, social progress and poverty alleviation in the region.
The Fund will serve as a financial institution for projects and programs, which are in fulfillment of the
objective of the SAARC Charter. It is aimed to contribute to regional cooperation and integration through
project collaboration.
The utilisation of fund monies shall be for the projects emanating from the following three windows:
•	 The ‘Social Window’ shall primarily fund projects on poverty alleviation, social development
focusing on education, health, human resource development, rural infrastructure development etc.
•	 The ‘Infrastructure Window’ shall primarily be utilised to fund projects in areas such as energy,
power, transportation, telecommunication, environment, tourism and other infrastructure areas.
•	 The ‘Economic Window’ shall primarily extend funding to non-infrastructural projects related
to trade and industrial development, agriculture, service sectors, science and technology and
other non-infrastructure areas and also for projects which are not covered under Social and
Infrastructure Windows.
The Fund has currently activated the Social Window and disbursing fund for projects approved by
the Governing Council under social window. The Fund is also under process to operationalise its
other two windows viz. Economic & Infrastructure Windows
2. Application of new and revised International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs)
2.1	New and revised IFRSs affecting amounts reported and/or disclosures in the financial statements
	

50

In the current year, the fund has applied a number of new and revised IFRSs issued by the
International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) that are mandatorily effective for an accounting
period that begins on or after 1 January 2016.
ANNUAL REPORT 2016-2017

-----------------------Page 50 End-----------------------

SAARC DEVELOPMENT FUND

2.1.1 Amendments to IAS 19 Defined Benefit Plans: Employee Contributions
The Fund has applied the amendments for the first time in the current year. The amendments require
the Fund that the rate used to discount post-employment benefit obligations should be determined
by reference to market yields at the end of the reporting period on high quality corporate bonds. The
assessment of the depth of a market for high quality corporate bonds should be at the currency level (i.e.
the same currency as the benefits are to be paid). For currencies for which there is no deep market in
such high quality corporate bonds, the market yields at the end of the reporting period on government
bonds denominated in that currency should be used instead.
These amendments have been applied in the current year. As the rate used to discount postemployment benefit obligations by the Fund is the same as the market yields at the end of the reporting
period on high quality corporate bonds, the application of these amendments has had no impact on the
disclosures or the amounts recognised in the Funds financial statements.
2.1.2 Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2012 – 2014 Cycle
The Fund has applied the amendments to IFRSs included in the Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2012 2014 Cycle for the first time in the current year. The application of the these amendments has had no
impact on the disclosures or amounts recognised in the Fund’s financial statements.
3. New and revised IFRSs in issue but not yet effective
The Fund has not applied the following new and revised IFRSs that have been issued but are not yet
effective:
	IFRS 9 :					Financial Instruments**
	
IFRS 15 :					
Revenue from contracts with customers**
	IFRS 16 :					Leases***
	
Amendments to IFRS 2 :			
Classification and Measurement of Share-based 		
							Payment Transactions**
	
Amendments to IFRS 10 and IAS 28 :
Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor 	
							and its Associate or Joint Venture****
	
Amendments to IAS 7 :
Disclosure Initiative*
	
Amendments to IAS 12 :
Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for 			
							Unrealised Losses*
* Effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2017, with earlier application permitted.
** Effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018, with earlier application permitted.
*** Effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019, with earlier application permitted.
**** Effective for annual periods beginning on or after a date to be determined.
The Fund is currently evaluating the requirements of the above IFRSs and has not yet determined the
impact on the financial statement.
4. Basis of preparation
4.1 Statement of compliance
These financial statements have been prepared in compliance with the International Financial
Reporting Standards (IFRS) and are presented in accordance with the Fund’s Charter and Bye-laws.
The financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2016 were authorized by the Board of
Directors on 22.12.2017 for issuance to the Governing Council on 22.12.2017 for their final approval.

SAARC DEVELOPMENT FUND

4.2 Basis of measurement
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for financial
instruments that are measured at fair values at the end of each reporting period, as explained in the
accounting policies below.
4.3 Functional currency
The Fund’s functional currency is U.S. dollar (USD). The functional currency is the currency of the
primary economic environment in which an entity operates and is normally the currency in which the
entity primarily generates and expends cash.
4.4 Presentation currency
As required under Bye Laws of the Fund these financial statements are presented in Special
Drawings Rights (‘SDR’). All financial information presented in SDR has been rounded to the nearest
SDR, except when otherwise indicated.
The value of the SDR is determined by the International Monetary Fund (‘IMF’) each day by summing
the values in U.S. dollars, based on market exchange rates, of the currencies in the SDR valuation
basket. The IMF reviews the SDR valuation basket every five years. The current composition of the
SDR valuation basket became effective on 1 January 2011.
The currencies in the basket at 31 December 2016 and 31 December 2015 and their amounts were
as follows:
Currency
Euro
Japanese yen
Pound sterling
U.S. dollar
Chinese yuan

2016
0.387
11.900
0.086
0.583
1.017

2015
0.423
12.100
0.111
0.660
-

At 31 December 2016, one SDR was equal to US$1.344330 (one SDR was equal to US$1.385730 as
at 31 December 2015), which is as determined and reported by International Monetary Fund (IMF).
4.5 Use of estimates and judgments
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS require management to make
judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and
the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from
estimates.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting
estimates are recognized in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods
affected.
Information about significant areas of estimation/uncertainty in applying accounting policies that have
the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements are as follows:
•	 Refer note 5.7 Property, plant and equipment (refer note 7 for carrying amount)
•	 Refer note 5.8 Intangible assets (refer note 8 for carrying amount)
•	 Refer note 5.10 Employee benefit (refer note 11 for carrying amount)

SAARC DEVELOPMENT FUND

5. Significant accounting policies
The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all periods presented in
these financial statements.
5.1 Foreign currency translation
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the functional currency of the Fund at exchange
rates at the dates of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign
currencies at the reporting date are translated to the functional currency at the exchange rate at that
date. The foreign currency gain or loss on monetary items is the difference between amortized cost
in the functional currency at the beginning of the period, adjusted for effective interest and payments
during the period, and the amortized cost in foreign currency translated at the exchange rate at the
end of the reporting period. Foreign currency differences arising on translation are recognized in
statement of profit or loss.
Translation from functional currency to presentation currency:
As mentioned above, these financial statements are presented in Special Drawings Rights (‘SDR’).
•	 The assets and liabilities are translated to SDR at exchange rate at the date of the balance
sheet.
•	 The income and expenses are translated to SDR at exchange rates at an average rate of the
financial year.
•	 Initial contribution received from member countries are converted at the rate as on the date of
receipt.
All resulting exchange differences are recognized in other comprehensive income and are
presented in the translation reserve within ‘Statement of Changes in Reserves’
5.2 Financial instruments
a. Non- derivative financial assets:
The classification of financial instruments depends on the substance of the contractual arrangement.
The Fund’s non-derivative financial assets comprise of Loans and receivables.
The Fund initially recognizes loans and receivables on the date that they are originated.
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that
are not quoted in an active market. Loans and receivables are measured initially at cost plus any
directly attributable transaction costs and subsequently carried at amortized cost using the effective
interest method, less any impairment loss. Loans and receivables comprise investment in fixed
deposits with original maturities more than 3 months and other receivables.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and on hand and short-term deposits with original
maturities of three months or less that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which
are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in their fair value. For these short term deposits, the
carrying value approximates the fair value due to the short maturity of these instruments.
Fixed deposits with banks
Fixed deposits with banks comprise of fixed deposits with original maturities of more than three
months.
ANNUAL REPORT 2016-2017

53

-----------------------Page 53 End-----------------------

SAARC DEVELOPMENT FUND

The Fund derecognizes a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the
asset expire, or it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows on the financial asset
in a transaction in which substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset
are transferred. Any interest in transferred financial assets that is created or retained by the Fund is
recognized as a separate asset or liability.
Other receivables
Other receivables mainly comprise of advances paid to vendors.
b. Non derivative financial liabilities :
The Fund recognizes financial liabilities initially on the trade date at which the Fund becomes a party
to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
The Fund derecognizes a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged or cancelled
or expired.
The Fund classifies non-derivative financial liabilities into the other financial liabilities category. Such
financial liabilities are recognized initially at fair value plus any directly attributable transaction costs.
Subsequent to initial recognition these financial liabilities are measured at amortized cost using the
effective interest method.
Other financial liabilities comprise ‘Trade and other payable’.
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount presented in the statement of financial
position when, and only when, the Fund has a legal right to offset the amounts and intends either to
settle them on a net basis or to realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
5.3 Retained earnings
These reserves represent accumulation of excess of income over expenditure in Statement of profit
or loss. Such excess Funds carry no specific reservation or restriction and can be applied as per the
Fund Charter.
5.4 Unrestricted and restricted contribution
•	 Capital contribution
This represents the contribution given by the Member States. These are not subject to any legal
or third-party restriction and can be applied as per the Fund Charter.
•	 Voluntary contributions and contributions in kind
Voluntary contributions from member states (unrestricted reserves) or other governments/
institutions are recognized as income over the periods necessary to match them with the related
costs which they are intended to compensate, on a systematic basis. Such income is presented
on a systematic basis as a deduction in reporting the related expense in the periods in which the
expenses are recognised.
Contribution in kind for assets are recognised initially as restricted reserves (deferred income) at
fair value when there is reasonable assurance that they will be received and the Fund will comply
with the conditions associated with the grant, and are then recognised in Statement of profit or
loss as income on a systematic basis over the useful life of the asset.
The value of contributions in kind is determined by the donor’s indication of the value of the
goods, including the cost of transport to the final destination.

ANNUAL REPORT 2016-2017

-----------------------Page 54 End-----------------------

SAARC DEVELOPMENT FUND

Contribution in services such as in the form of rent or other expenses is recognized in the
Statement of profit or loss when such services are received and are presented in statement of
profit or loss as a deduction from the related expense.
•	 Funds received on cessation of South Asian Development Fund (‘SADF’)
This represents the balance transferred on the closure of the earlier SADF to the Fund. These are
not subject to any legal or third-party restriction and can be applied as per the Fund Charter in the
“Economic window” as decided by the Management.
5.5 Payments to and on behalf of beneficiaries
Payments to and on behalf of beneficiaries under social window are recognized as expense in
the Statement of profit or loss when the specified conditions in the respective agreements are
achieved and amount disbursed to the Implementing Agencies and/or Lead Implementing Agencies.
Equivalent amount is transferred from the voluntary contribution to the Statement of profit or loss.
Expenses incurred for projects in pipeline are initially charged off to the Statement of profit or loss.
On subsequent approval of the project, equivalent amount is transferred to the Statement of profit or
loss.
5.6 Investment income
Finance income comprises interest income on Funds invested and idle funds lying with projects
detailed in note 15 below. Interest income is recognized as it accrues in statement of profit or loss,
using the effective interest method. Interest earned on idle funds lying with projects has been
recognised based on information received from the Implementing agencies and Lead implementing
agencies.
Foreign currency gains and losses are reported on a net basis
5.7 Property, plant and equipment
a. Recognition and Measurement
Items of property, plant and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and any
accumulated impairment losses.
Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset. Purchased
software that is integral to the functionality of the related equipment is capitalized as part of that
equipment.
When parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are
accounted for as separate items (major components) of property, plant and equipment.
Gains and losses on disposal of an item of property, plant and equipment are determined by
comparing the proceeds from disposal with the carrying amount of ithe item, and are recognized net
under the head ‘Other gain or losses (as the case may be)’ in statement of profit or loss.
b. Subsequent Costs
Subsequent expenditure is recognized as an increase in the carrying amount of the asset when it is
probable that future economic benefits deriving from the cost incurred will flow to the enterprise and
the cost of the item can be reliably determined. The costs of the day-to-day servicing of property,
plant and equipment are recognized in Statement of profit or loss as incurred.
ANNUAL REPORT 2016-2017

55

-----------------------Page 55 End-----------------------

SAARC DEVELOPMENT FUND

c. Depreciation
Items of property, plant and equipment are depreciated from the date they are available for use.
Depreciation is calculated to write off the cost of items of property, plant and equipment less their
estimated residual values using the straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. Depreciation
is recognized in Statement of profit or loss unless the amount is included in the carrying amount of
another asset.
The estimated useful lives are as follows:
	
Vehicles					: 6 years
	
Furniture					: 10 years
	 Office equipment 				
: 6 years
	 Computers and peripherals 			
: 6 years
	 Leasehold improvements 			
: Useful life of asset or lease term whichever is 		
							 shorter
	 Servers and networking equipments 	
: 6 years
Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each financial year end and
adjusted as appropriate.
5.8 Intangible assets
a. Acquired intangibles.
Acquired rights and licenses are measured at cost less accumulated amortization and any
accumulated impairment losses. Cost includes expenditure that are directly attributable to the
acquisition of the intangible assets.
b. Subsequent expenditure
Subsequent expenditure is capitalized only when it increases the future economic benefits embodied
in the specific asset to which it relates. All other expenditure, is recognized in profit or loss as
incurred.
c. Amortization
Amortization is recognized in the Statement of profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the
estimated useful lives of intangible assets from the date that they are available for use, since
this most closely reflects the expected pattern of consumption of the future economic benefits
embodied in the asset.
The estimated useful lives are as follows:
	 Software :6 years or licensing period or over the period for which the right is obtained
Amortization methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each financial year-end and
adjusted as appropriate.

SAARC DEVELOPMENT FUND

5.9 Impairment
a. Financial assets
The carrying amount of Fund’s assets is assessed at each reporting date to determine whether there
is objective evidence that it is impaired. Financial assets are considered to be impaired when there is
objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of
the financial asset, the estimated future cash flows of the investment have been affected.
The Fund considers evidence of impairment for receivables for each specific asset. All individually
significant receivables are assessed for specific impairment. Those found not to be specifically
impaired are then collectively assessed for any impairment that has been incurred but not yet
identified. Assets that are not individually significant are collectively assessed for impairment by
grouping together assets with similar risk characteristics.
An impairment loss in respect of a financial asset measured at amortized cost is calculated as the
difference between its carrying amount and the present value of the estimated future cash flows
discounted at the asset’s original effective interest rate. Losses are recognized in Statement of profit
or loss and reflected in an allowance account against receivables. Interest on the impaired asset
continues to be recognized. When a subsequent event causes the amount of impairment loss to
decrease, the decrease in impairment loss is reversed through statement of profit or loss.
b. Non-Financial Assets
The carrying amounts of the Fund’s non-financial assets are reviewed at each reporting date to
determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, then the
asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of
an asset or cash-generating unit (CGU) exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is the greater of its value in use and its
fair value less costs to sell. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted
to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of
the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. For the purpose of impairment testing,
assets are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows from
continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or groups of assets
(the “cash-generating unit”, or “CGU”).
Impairment losses are recognized in statement of profit or loss. Impairment losses recognized in
respect of CGUs are allocated to reduce the carrying amounts of the assets in the CGU (group of
CGUs) on a pro rata basis
An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed
the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortization, if no
impairment loss had been recognized.
5.10 Employee benefit plans
Short-term employee benefits
Short-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are expensed
as the related service is provided.

ANNUAL REPORT 2016-2017

57

-----------------------Page 57 End-----------------------

SAARC DEVELOPMENT FUND

a) Defined contribution plans
A defined contribution plan is a post-employment benefit plan under which an entity pays fixed
contributions into a separate entity and has no legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts.
Obligations for contributions to defined contribution plans are recognised as an employee benefit
expense in the Statement of profit or loss in the periods during which related services are rendered
by employees.
b) Defined benefit plans
A defined benefit plan is a post-employment benefit plan other than a defined contribution plan.
In accordance with the SAARC Development Fund’s Financial and Administration Provisions, SDF
provides for gratuity, a defined benefit retirement plan (the Gratuity Plan) to its eligible employees.
The Gratuity Plan provides a lump-sum payment to vested employees at retirement, death,
incapacitation or termination of employment, of an amount based on the respective employee’s
salary and the tenure of employment.
The Fund’s net obligation in respect of defined benefit plans is calculated for the gratuity plan by
estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service
in the current and prior periods. That benefit is discounted to determine its present value. Any
unrecognised past service costs and the fair value of any plan assets are deducted. The discount rate
is based on the Government securities yield that have maturity dates approximating the terms of the
Group’s obligations and that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits are expected to
be paid.
Liabilities with regard to the Gratuity Plan are determined by actuarial valuation, performed by an
independent actuary, at each balance sheet date using the projected unit credit method.
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions
are charged or credited to Other comprehensive income in the period in which they arise.
5.11 Provisions and contingent liabilities
A provision is recognized if, as a result of a past event, the Fund has a present legal or constructive
obligation that can be estimated reliably, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will
be required to settle the obligation. Provisions are determined by discounting the expected future
cash flows at a rate that reflects current market assumptions of the time value of money and the
risks specific to the liability. The unwinding of discount is recognized as finance cost.
The amount recognized as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the
present obligation at reporting date, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the
obligation.
When some or all of the economic benefits required to settle a provision are expected to be
recovered from a third party, the receivable is recognized as an asset if it is virtually certain that
reimbursement will be received and the amount of the receivable can be measured reliably.
Contingent liabilities are possible obligations that arise from past events and whose existence will
only be confirmed by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more future events not wholly
within the control of the Fund. Where it is not probable that an outflow of economic benefits will
be required, or the amount cannot be estimated reliably, the obligation is disclosed as a contingent
liability, unless the probability of outflow of economic benefits is remote.

SAARC DEVELOPMENT FUND

5.12 Leasing arrangements as a lessee
Accounting for Operating Leases
Assets held under other leases are classified as operating leases and are not recognised in the
Fund’s statement of financial position. Payments made under operating leases are recognized as an
expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Lease incentives received are recognised as an
integral part of the total lease expense, over the term of the lease.
6. Financial risk management
The Fund has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments:
•	 Credit risk
•	 Liquidity risk
Market risk
This note presents information about the Fund’s exposure to each of the above risks, the Fund’s
objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing risk, and the Fund’s management of
capital. Further quantitative disclosures are included throughout these financial statements.
6.1 Risk management framework
The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Fund’s
risk management framework. Risk management is carried out by the top management under
policies approved by the board of directors. The board provides written principles for overall risk
management, as well as written policies covering specific areas, such as foreign exchange risk,
interest rate risk and credit risk.
The Fund’s risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the
Fund, to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to limits. Risk
management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and
the Fund’s activities. The Fund, through its training and management standards and procedures, aims
to develop a disciplined and constructive control environment in which all employees understand
their roles and obligations.
The Fund’s overall risk management program focuses on unpredictability of financial markets and
seeks to minimize potential adverse effects on the Fund’s financial performance. Internal Audit
undertakes both regular and ad hoc reviews of risk management controls and procedures, the results
of which are reported to The Board of Directors.
6.1.1 a. Credit risk
Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting
in financial loss to the Fund. The Fund’s treasury policy focuses on security of cash and cash
equivalents including term deposits. Investments are allowed only in liquid securities and only with
counterparties that have a high credit rating. The Fund’s exposure and the creditworthyness of its
counterparties are continuously monitored and the aggregate value of transactions concluded is
spread amongst approved counterparties.
The Fund held cash and cash equivalents and investments in fixed deposits along with accrued
interest thereon of SDR 313,034,096 (2015: SDR 292,779,455), which represents its maximum credit
exposure on these assets. These are held in government authorised banks and there is no significant
exposure. Details of investments held in different countries:

6.1.2 b. Liquidity risk
The Fund’s objective is to strike a balance between funding continuity and flexibility by maintaining
sufficient funds as cash in hand or as on-demand or short-term deposits with maturities of three
months or less to meet short-term liabilities. All the non-derivative financial liabilities as on the date
of the balance sheet have a maturity period of less than one year. The Fund’s approach to managing
liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities
when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or
risking damage to the Fund’s reputation.
The Fund uses activity-based costing, which assists it in monitoring cash flow requirements and
optimising its cash return on investments. Typically the Fund ensures that it has sufficient cash on
demand to meet expected operational expenses for a period of 60 days, this excludes the potential
impact of extreme circumstances that cannot reasonably be predicted, such as natural disasters.
The Fund regularly monitors its liquidity to keep it at adequate levels, with periodic reports to the
chief operating decision maker.
The following are the contractual maturities of non derivative financial liabilities as of the reporting
dates:

6.1.3 c. Market risk
Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates and interest
rates will affect the Fund’s income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments. The objective
of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable
parameters, while optimising the return.
(i) Currency risk
Exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates arises from transactions denominated in
currencies other than the Fund’s functional currency, which is the USD.

(ii) Interest Rate Risk
The investment portfolio is exposed to market risk due to interest rate movements. The interest rate
risk is reduced by limiting the duration of the portfolio to a weighted average of 0-12 months and
investment in fixed rate instruments.
At the reporting date the interest rate profile of the Fund’s interest-bearing financial instruments was
as follows:
Fixed rate instruments
Financial assets
Cash and cash equivalents
Fixed deposits (current)
Fixed deposits (non-current)
Total

As at 31-Dec-16
151,976,621
151,865,426
303,842,047

As at 31-Dec-15
149,733,851
135,323,890
285,057,741

Fair value sensitivity analysis for fixed rate instruments
The Fund does not account for any fixed rate financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit
or loss. Therefore a change in interest rates at the reporting date would not affect profit or loss.

The Fund will serve as a financial institution for projects and programs, which are in fulfillment of the
objective of the SAARC Charter. It is aimed to contribute to regional cooperation and integration through
project collaboration.
				
•	 The utilisation of fund monies shall be for the projects emanating from the following three
windows:
•	 The ‘Social Window’ shall primarily fund projects on poverty alleviation, social development
focusing on education, health, human resource development, rural infrastructure development etc.
•	 The ‘Infrastructure Window’ shall primarily be utilised to fund projects in areas such as energy,
power, transportation, telecommunication, environment, tourism and other infrastructure areas.
•	 The ‘Economic Window’ shall primarily extend funding to non-infrastructural projects related
to trade and industrial development, agriculture, service sectors, science and technology and
other non-infrastructure areas and also for projects which are not covered under Social and
Infrastructure Windows.
The Fund has currently activated the Social Window and disbursing fund for projects approved by
the Governing Council under social window. The Fund is also under process to operationalise its
other two windows viz. Economic and Infrastructure Windows.”				
2. Application of new and revised International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs)
2.1	New and revised IFRSs affecting amounts reported and/or disclosures in the financial statements
	

In the current year, the fund has applied a number of new and revised IFRSs issued by the
International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) that are mandatorily effective for an accounting
period that begins on or after 1 January 2017.

ANNUAL REPORT 2016-2017

-----------------------Page 85 End-----------------------

SAARC DEVELOPMENT FUND

2.1.1 Amendments to IAS 17: Disclosure Initiative
The amendment requires an entity to provide disclosures that enable users of financial statements to
evaluate changes in liabilities arising from financing activities, including both cash and non- cash changes.
The amendment applies prospectively. The comparative information for earlier periods are not required
to be presented when an entity first applies this amendment. The Fund has applied the amendments
for the first time in the current year. However, since the Fund has no external debt, and therefore, the
disclosure has no material impact on the financial statements.
2.1.2 Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2014 – 2016 Cycle
The annual improvements include amedments to IFRS 1 (regarding the deletion of short term
exemptions for the first time adopters regarding IFRS 7, IAS 19 and IFRS 10) and IAS 28 (regarding
measuring an associate or joint venture at fair value). The package also includes IFRS 12- Disclosure of
Interests in Other Entities which states that an entity need not provide summarised financial information
of interests in subsidiaries, associates or joint ventures that are classified as held for sale which is
effective from 1 January 2017. The amendments to IFRS 1 and IAS 28 are mandatorily effective from 1
January 2018. These amendment are not applicable to the Fund.
2.1.3 Amendments effective on or after 1 January 2017 which are not applicable to the Fund:
a. Amendments to IAS 12 Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for Unrealised Losses: The amendment
states that if the tax laws restricts the utilisation of losses to deductions against income of a specific
type, a decuctible temporary difference is assessed in combination only with other deductible temporary
differences of the appropriate type. The Find is required to compare the deductible temporary
differences with future taxable profits that excludes tax deductions resulting from the reversal of
those deductible temporary differences. Since the Fund is not liable to pay taxes on the income, this
amendment is not applicable to it.			
3. New and revised IFRSs in issue but not yet effective
The Fund has not applied the following new and revised IFRSs that have been issued but are not yet
effective:
	IFRS 9 :					Financial Instruments*				
	
IFRS 15 :					
Revenue from contracts with customers and related 	
							clarifications*			
	IFRS 16 :					Leases**				
	
Amendments to IFRS 2 :

SAARC DEVELOPMENT FUND

4. Basis of preparation
4.1 Statement of compliance
These financial statements have been prepared in compliance with the International Financial
Reporting Standards (IFRS) and are presented in accordance with the Fund’s Charter and Bye-laws.
The financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017 were authorized by the Board of
Directors on ………… 2018 for issuance to the Governing Council on ………….2018 for their final
approval.
4.2 Basis of measurement
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for financial
instruments that are measured at fair values at the end of each reporting period, as explained in the
accounting policies below. Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration
given in exchange for goods and services.	
			
Fair Value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly
transaction between market participants at the measurement date, regardless of whether that price
is directly observable or estimated using another valuation technique.				
4.3 Functional currency
The Fund’s functional currency is U.S. dollar (USD). The functional currency is the currency of the
primary economic environment in which an entity operates and is normally the currency in which the
entity primarily generates and expends cash.		
4.4 Presentation currency
As required under Bye Laws of the Fund these financial statements are presented in Special
Drawings Rights (‘SDR’). All financial information presented in SDR has been rounded to the nearest
SDR, except when otherwise indicated.
The value of the SDR is determined by the International Monetary Fund (‘IMF’) each day by summing
the values in U.S. dollars, based on market exchange rates, of the currencies in the SDR valuation
basket. The IMF reviews the SDR valuation basket every five years. The current composition of the
SDR valuation basket became effective on 1 January 2011.
The currencies in the basket at 31 December 2017 and 31 December 2016 and their amounts were
as follows:”				
Currency
Euro
Japanese yen
Pound sterling
U.S. dollar
Chinese yuan

2017
0.387
11.900
0.086
0.583
1.017

2016
0.387
11.900
0.086
0.583
1.017

At 31 December 2017, one SDR was equal to US$1.424134 (one SDR was equal to US$1.344330 as
at 31 December 2016), which is as determined and reported by International Monetary Fund (IMF).

SAARC DEVELOPMENT FUND

4.5 Use of estimates and judgments
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS require management to make
judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and
the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. The estimates and associated
assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered relevant. Actual
results may differ from estimates.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting
estimates are recognized in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods
affected.
Information about significant areas of estimation/uncertainty in applying accounting policies that have
the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements are as follows:
•	 Refer note 5.7 Property, plant and equipment (refer note 7 for carrying amount)
•	 Refer note 5.8 Intangible assets (refer note 8 for carrying amount)
•	 Refer note 5.10 Employee benefit (refer note 11 for carrying amount)		
5. Significant accounting policies
The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all periods presented in
these financial statements.
5.1 Foreign currency translation
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the functional currency of the Fund at exchange
rates at the dates of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign
currencies at the reporting date are translated to the functional currency at the exchange rate at that
date. The foreign currency gain or loss on monetary items is the difference between amortized cost
in the functional currency at the beginning of the period, adjusted for effective interest and payments
during the period, and the amortized cost in foreign currency translated at the exchange rate at the
end of the reporting period. Foreign currency differences arising on translation are recognized in
statement of profit or loss.				
Translation from functional currency to presentation currency:
As mentioned above, these financial statements are presented in Special Drawings Rights (‘SDR’).
•	 The assets and liabilities are translated to SDR at exchange rate at the date of the balance
sheet.
•	 The income and expenses are translated to SDR at exchange rates at an average rate of the
financial year.
•	 Initial contribution received from member countries are converted at the rate as on the date of
receipt.
All resulting exchange differences are recognized in other comprehensive income and are
presented in the translation reserve within ‘Statement of Changes in Reserves’
5.2 Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when the Fund becomes a party to the
contractual provisions of the instrument. Financial assets and liabilities are initially measured at fair
value. Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial assets
88

ANNUAL REPORT 2016-2017

-----------------------Page 88 End-----------------------

SAARC DEVELOPMENT FUND

The Fund initially recognizes loans and receivables on the date that they are originated.
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that
are not quoted in an active market. Loans and receivables are measured at amortized cost using the
effective interest method, less any impairment loss. Interest income is recognised by applying the
effective interest rate, except for short term receivables when the effect of discounting is immaterial.
Loans and receivables comprise investment in bank deposits with original maturities more than 3
months, interest accrued on such bank deposits, capital contributions due and receivable and other
receivables such as advance to vendors, staff advances and deposits.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and on hand and short-term deposits with original
maturities of three months or less that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which
are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in their fair value. For these short term deposits, the
carrying value approximates the fair value due to the short maturity of these instruments.			
	
Fixed deposits with banks
Fixed deposits with banks comprise of fixed deposits with original maturities of more than three
months.
The Fund derecognizes a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the
asset expire, or it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows on the financial asset
in a transaction in which substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset
are transferred. Any interest in transferred financial assets that is created or retained by the Fund is
recognized as a separate asset or liability.		
b. Non derivative financial liabilities :
The Fund recognizes financial liabilities initially on the trade date at which the Fund becomes a party
to the contractual provisions of the instrument.				
The Fund derecognizes a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged or cancelled
or expired.
The Fund classifies non-derivative financial liabilities into the other financial liabilities category. Such
financial liabilities are recognized initially at fair value plus any directly attributable transaction costs.
Subsequent to initial recognition these financial liabilities are measured at amortized cost using the
effective interest method.
Other financial liabilities comprise ‘Trade and other payable’.
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount presented in the statement of financial
position when, and only when, the Fund has a legal right to offset the amounts and intends either to
settle them on a net basis or to realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.		
	
5.3 Retained earnings
These reserves represent accumulation of excess of income over expenditure in Statement of profit
or loss. Such excess Funds carry no specific reservation or restriction and can be applied as per the
Fund Charter.

ANNUAL REPORT 2016-2017

-----------------------Page 89 End-----------------------

SAARC DEVELOPMENT FUND

5.4 Unrestricted and restricted contribution
•	 Capital contribution
This represents the contribution given by the Member States. These are not subject to any legal
or third-party restriction and can be applied as per the Fund Charter.
•	 Voluntary contributions and contributions in kind
Voluntary contributions from member states (unrestricted reserves) or other governments/
institutions are recognized as income over the periods necessary to match them with the related
costs which they are intended to compensate, on a systematic basis. Such income is presented
on a systematic basis as a deduction in reporting the related expense in the periods in which the
expenses are recognised.
Contribution in kind for assets are recognised initially as restricted reserves (deferred income) at
fair value when there is reasonable assurance that they will be received and the Fund will comply
with the conditions associated with the grant, and are then recognised in Statement of profit or
loss as income on a systematic basis over the useful life of the asset.
The value of contributions in kind is determined by the donor’s indication of the value of the
goods, including the cost of transport to the final destination.
Contribution in services such as in the form of rent or other expenses is recognized in the
Statement of profit or loss when such services are received and are presented in statement of
profit or loss as a deduction from the related expense.
•	 Funds received on cessation of South Asian Development Fund (‘SADF’)
This represents the balance transferred on the closure of the earlier SADF to the Fund. These are
not subject to any legal or third-party restriction and can be applied as per the Fund Charter in the
“Economic window” as decided by the Management.
5.5 Payments to and on behalf of beneficiaries
Payments to and on behalf of beneficiaries under social window are recognized as expense in
the Statement of profit or loss when the specified conditions in the respective agreements are
achieved and amount disbursed to the Implementing Agencies and/or Lead Implementing Agencies.
Equivalent amount is transferred from the voluntary contribution to the Statement of profit or loss.
Expenses incurred for projects which are in pipeline are initially charged off to the Statement of
profit or loss. On subsequent approval of the project, the amount spent initially is transferred to the
respective project disbursement and equivalent amount adjusted from voluntary contribution.
5.6 Investment income
Finance income comprises interest income on Funds invested and idle funds lying with projects
detailed in note 15 below. Interest income from a financial asset is recognised when it is probable
that the economic benefits will flow to the Fund and the amount of income can be measured
realiably. Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and
at the effective interest rate applicable, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future
cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that asset’s net carrying amount on
initial recognition. Interest earned on idle funds lying with projects has been recognised based on
information received from the Implementing agencies and Lead implementing agencies.
Foreign currency gains and losses are reported on a net basis.

ANNUAL REPORT 2016-2017

-----------------------Page 90 End-----------------------

SAARC DEVELOPMENT FUND

5.7 Property, plant and equipment
a. Recognition and Measurement
Items of property, plant and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and any
accumulated impairment losses.
Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset. Purchased
software that is integral to the functionality of the related equipment is capitalized as part of that
equipment.
When parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are
accounted for as separate items (major components) of property, plant and equipment.
Gains and losses on disposal of an item of property, plant and equipment are determined by
comparing the proceeds from disposal with the carrying amount of ithe item, and are recognized net
under the head ‘Other gain or losses (as the case may be)’ in statement of profit or loss.
b. Subsequent Costs
Subsequent expenditure is recognized as an increase in the carrying amount of the asset when it is
probable that future economic benefits deriving from the cost incurred will flow to the enterprise and
the cost of the item can be reliably determined. The costs of the day-to-day servicing of property,
plant and equipment are recognized in Statement of profit or loss as incurred.
c. Depreciation
Items of property, plant and equipment are depreciated from the date they are available for use.
Depreciation is calculated to write off the cost of items of property, plant and equipment less their
estimated residual values using the straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. Depreciation
is recognized in Statement of profit or loss unless the amount is included in the carrying amount of
another asset.
The estimated useful lives are as follows:
	
Vehicles					: 6 years
	
Furniture					: 10 years
	 Office equipment 				
: 6 years
	 Computers and peripherals 			
: 6 years
	 Leasehold improvements 			
: Useful life of asset or lease term whichever is 		
							 shorter
	 Servers and networking equipments 	
: 6 years
Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each financial year end and
adjusted as appropriate.
5.8 Intangible assets
a. Acquired intangibles.
Acquired rights and licenses are measured at cost less accumulated amortization and any
accumulated impairment losses. Cost includes expenditure that are directly attributable to the
acquisition of the intangible assets.
ANNUAL REPORT 2016-2017

91

-----------------------Page 91 End-----------------------

SAARC DEVELOPMENT FUND

b. Subsequent expenditure
Subsequent expenditure is capitalized only when it increases the future economic benefits embodied
in the specific asset to which it relates. All other expenditure, is recognized in profit or loss as
incurred.
c. Amortization
Amortization is recognized in the Statement of profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the
estimated useful lives of intangible assets from the date that they are available for use, since
this most closely reflects the expected pattern of consumption of the future economic benefits
embodied in the asset.
The estimated useful lives are as follows:
	 Software :6 years or licensing period or over the period for which the right is obtained
Amortization methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each financial year-end and
adjusted as appropriate.
5.9 Impairment
a. Financial assets
The carrying amount of Fund’s assets is assessed at each reporting date to determine whether there
is objective evidence that it is impaired. Financial assets are considered to be impaired when there is
objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of
the financial asset, the estimated future cash flows of the investment have been affected.
The Fund considers evidence of impairment for receivables for each specific asset. All individually
significant receivables are assessed for specific impairment. Those found not to be specifically
impaired are then collectively assessed for any impairment that has been incurred but not yet
identified. Assets that are not individually significant are collectively assessed for impairment by
grouping together assets with similar risk characteristics.
An impairment loss in respect of a financial asset measured at amortized cost is calculated as the
difference between its carrying amount and the present value of the estimated future cash flows
discounted at the asset’s original effective interest rate. Losses are recognized in Statement of profit
or loss and reflected in an allowance account against receivables. Interest on the impaired asset
continues to be recognized. When a subsequent event causes the amount of impairment loss to
decrease, the decrease in impairment loss is reversed through statement of profit or loss.
b. Non-Financial Assets
The carrying amounts of the Fund’s non-financial assets are reviewed at each reporting date to
determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, then the
asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of
an asset or cash-generating unit (CGU) exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is the greater of its value in use and its
fair value less costs to sell. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted
to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of
the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. For the purpose of impairment testing,
assets are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows from
continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or groups of assets
(the “cash-generating unit”, or “CGU”).
92

ANNUAL REPORT 2016-2017

-----------------------Page 92 End-----------------------

SAARC DEVELOPMENT FUND

Impairment losses are recognized in statement of profit or loss. Impairment losses recognized in
respect of CGUs are allocated to reduce the carrying amounts of the assets in the CGU (group of
CGUs) on a pro rata basis
An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed
the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortization, if no
impairment loss had been recognized.
5.10 Employee benefit plans
Short-term employee benefits
Short-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are expensed
as the related service is provided.
a) Defined contribution plans
A defined contribution plan is a post-employment benefit plan under which an entity pays fixed
contributions into a separate entity and has no legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts.
Obligations for contributions to defined contribution plans are recognised as an employee benefit
expense in the Statement of profit or loss in the periods during which related services are rendered
by employees.
b) Defined benefit plans
A defined benefit plan is a post-employment benefit plan other than a defined contribution plan.
In accordance with the SAARC Development Fund’s Financial and Administration Provisions, SDF
provides for gratuity, a defined benefit retirement plan (the Gratuity Plan) to its eligible employees.
The Gratuity Plan provides a lump-sum payment to vested employees at retirement, death,
incapacitation or termination of employment, of an amount based on the respective employee’s
salary and the tenure of employment.
The Fund’s net obligation in respect of defined benefit plans is calculated for the gratuity plan by
estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service
in the current and prior periods. That benefit is discounted to determine its present value. Any
unrecognised past service costs and the fair value of any plan assets are deducted. The discount rate
is based on the Government securities yield that have maturity dates approximating the terms of the
Fund’s obligations and that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits are expected to be
paid.
Liabilities with regard to the Gratuity Plan are determined by actuarial valuation, performed by an
independent actuary, at each balance sheet date using the projected unit credit method.
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions
are charged or credited to Other comprehensive income in the period in which they arise.
5.11 Provisions and contingent liabilities
A provision is recognized if, as a result of a past event, the Fund has a present legal or constructive
obligation that can be estimated reliably, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will
be required to settle the obligation. Provisions are determined by discounting the expected future
cash flows at a rate that reflects current market assumptions of the time value of money and the
risks specific to the liability. The unwinding of discount is recognized as finance cost.

ANNUAL REPORT 2016-2017

-----------------------Page 93 End-----------------------

SAARC DEVELOPMENT FUND

The amount recognized as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the
present obligation at reporting date, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the
obligation.
When some or all of the economic benefits required to settle a provision are expected to be
recovered from a third party, the receivable is recognized as an asset if it is virtually certain that
reimbursement will be received and the amount of the receivable can be measured reliably.
Contingent liabilities are possible obligations that arise from past events and whose existence will
only be confirmed by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more future events not wholly
within the control of the Fund. Where it is not probable that an outflow of economic benefits will
be required, or the amount cannot be estimated reliably, the obligation is disclosed as a contingent
liability, unless the probability of outflow of economic benefits is remote.
5.12 Leasing arrangements as a lessee
Accounting for Operating Leases
Assets held under other leases are classified as operating leases and are not recognised in the
Fund’s statement of financial position. Payments made under operating leases are recognized as an
expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Contingent rentals arsing are recognised as an
expense in the period in which they are incurred. Lease incentives received to enter into operating
lease are recognised as a liability. The aggregate benefit of incentives is recognised as reduction of
rental expense on a straight line basis.
The Fund does not has any lease classified as Finance Lease. The Fund has not enterred into any
leasing transaction as a Lessor.
6. Financial risk management
The Fund has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments:
•	 Credit risk
•	 Liquidity risk
•	 Market risk
This note presents information about the Fund’s exposure to each of the above risks, the Fund’s
objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing risk, and the Fund’s management of
capital. Further quantitative disclosures are included throughout these financial statements.
6.1 Risk management framework
The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Fund’s
risk management framework. Risk management is carried out by the top management under
policies approved by the board of directors. The board provides written principles for overall risk
management, as well as written policies covering specific areas, such as foreign exchange risk,
interest rate risk and credit risk.
The Fund’s risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the
Fund, to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to limits. Risk
management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and
the Fund’s activities. The Fund, through its training and management standards and procedures, aims
to develop a disciplined and constructive control environment in which all employees understand
their roles and obligations.

-----------------------Page 94 End-----------------------

SAARC DEVELOPMENT FUND

The Fund’s overall risk management program focuses on unpredictability of financial markets and
seeks to minimize potential adverse effects on the Fund’s financial performance. Internal Audit
undertakes both regular and ad hoc reviews of risk management controls and procedures, the results
of which are reported to The Board of Directors.
6.1.1 a. Credit risk
Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting
in financial loss to the Fund. The Fund’s treasury policy focuses on security of cash and cash
equivalents including term deposits. Investments are allowed only in liquid securities and only with
counterparties that have a high credit rating. The Fund’s exposure and the creditworthyness of its
counterparties are continuously monitored and the aggregate value of transactions concluded is
spread amongst approved counterparties.
The Fund held cash and cash equivalents and investments in fixed deposits along with accrued
interest thereon of SDR 310,180,216 (2016: SDR 313,034,096), which represents its maximum credit
exposure on these assets. These are held in government authorised banks. Details of investments

6.1.2 b. Liquidity risk
The Fund’s objective is to strike a balance between funding continuity and flexibility by maintaining
sufficient funds as cash in hand or as on-demand or short-term deposits with maturities of three
months or less to meet short-term liabilities. All the non-derivative financial liabilities as on the date
of the balance sheet have a maturity period of less than one year. The Fund’s approach to managing
liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities
when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or
risking damage to the Fund’s reputation.
The Fund uses activity-based costing, which assists it in monitoring cash flow requirements and
optimising its cash return on investments. Typically the Fund ensures that it has sufficient cash on
demand to meet expected operational expenses for a period of 60 days, this excludes the potential
impact of extreme circumstances that cannot reasonably be predicted, such as natural disasters.
The Fund regularly monitors its liquidity to keep it at adequate levels, with periodic reports to the
chief operating decision maker.
			
The following are the contractual maturities of non derivative financial liabilities as of the reporting
dates:

6.1.3 c. Market risk
Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates and interest
rates will affect the Fund’s income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments. The objective
of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable
parameters, while optimising the return.
(i) Currency risk
Exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates arises from transactions denominated in
currencies other than the Fund’s functional currency, which is the USD.

(ii) Interest Rate Risk
The investment portfolio is exposed to market risk due to interest rate movements. The interest rate
risk is reduced by limiting the duration of the portfolio to a weighted average of 0-12 months and
investment in fixed rate instruments.
At the reporting date the interest rate profile of the Fund’s interest-bearing financial instruments was
as follows:
Fixed rate instruments
Financial assets
Cash and cash equivalents
Fixed deposits (current)
Fixed deposits (non-current)
Total

As at 31-Dec-17
150,107,704
149,317,209

As at 31-Dec-16
151,976,621
151,865,426
303,842,047

Fair value sensitivity analysis for fixed rate instruments
The Fund does not account for any fixed rate financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit
or loss. Therefore a change in interest rates at the reporting date would not affect profit or loss.

Assumptions regarding future mortality rates are based on IALM (2006-2008).
The actuarial valuation is carried out yearly by an independent actuary. The discount rate used for determining the
present value of obligation under the defined benefit plan is determined by reference to market yields at the end of the
reporting period on Government Bonds with a term that matches that of the liabilities. The currency and the term of
the government bonds is consistent with the currency and term of the defined benefit obligation.
The salary growth rate takes into account inflation, seniority, promotion and other relevant factors on long-term basis.
The sensitivity analysis below have been determined based on reasonable possible changes of the respective assumptions occuring at the end of the reporting period, while holding all other assumptions constant.
A. If the discount rate is 50 basis point higher (lower), the defined benefit obligation would decrease by SDR 1,806
(increase by SDR 2,036).
B. If the future salary escalation is changed by 50 basis point higher (lower), the defined benefit obligation would
increase by SDR 2,014 (decrease by SDR 1,805).
The sensitivity analysis given above may not be representative of the actual change in the defined benefit obligation
as it is unlikely that the change in assumptions would occur in islolation of one another as some of the assumptions
may be correlated. Furthermore, in presenting the above sensitivity analysis, the present value of the defined benefit
obligation has been calculated using the projected unit credit method at the end of the reporting period , which is the
same as that applied in calculating the defined benefit obligation liability recognised in the Statement of Financial
Position. There was no change in the methods and assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analysis from prior
years.
