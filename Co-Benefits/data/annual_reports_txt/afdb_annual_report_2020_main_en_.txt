     BOX 2.1

     Bank financing helped mitigate the health and economic
     impact of the COVID-19 pandemic

      Examples of how Bank operations contributed to addressing the pandemic:

      HEALTH
      •	In South Sudan, 3,900 workers were equipped with PPE; and there was a stock of two tons of
        gloves and aprons awaiting distribution to 18 health care facilities.
      •	In Ethiopia, the daily testing capacity improved from 3,000 at the beginning of the outbreak to
        12,400 by December 2020.
      •	In Sierra Leone, 80 field health personnel were trained on contact tracing at the national and
        district levels, including at points of entry (POEs).

      SOCIAL PROTECTION
      •	In Niger, food aid benefited 2,052,000 people.
      •	In Burkina Faso, direct transfers of cash resources benefited 32,250 households out of a target
        of 43,000 vulnerable households. Some 150 demonstration stores were also opened to provide
        basic foodstuffs to low-income populations.
      •	In Côte d’Ivoire, Ghana, and Senegal, governments subsidized water and electricity payments
        for several months, benefiting close to 1 million citizens in each country.

      BUSINESS
      •	 Sixteen countries benefited from business tax deferrals/reductions.
      •	In South Africa, under the Credit Loan Guarantee Scheme, around USD 1.26 billion in loans were
        approved for 13,000 businesses.
      •	In Mauritius, the government announced that it would be allocating USD 12.5 million monthly
        towards supporting SMEs in the tourism sector.

               SPARK+ Africa Fund: Clean cooking solutions for Africa

               The SPARK+ Africa Fund was launched in 2020 by Enabling Qapital, an asset management and advisory
               company, and the Clean Cooking Alliance, a global organization, to channel debt and equity financing
               to enterprises that manufacture, distribute, and finance clean cooking solutions—such as biomass stoves,
               advanced biomass fuels, liquified petroleum gas (LPG) and ethanol, and biogas systems—across sub-
               Saharan Africa. The fund targets distributors and consumer finance providers, such as off-grid solar com-
               panies and microfinance institutions, that will extend their services to clean cooking products.
                  The Bank is making a USD 5 million equity investment from the SEFA Special Fund in the first-loss
               tranche of the SPARK+ Africa Fund. The European Union’s Africa Investment Platform is contributing an
               additional EUR 10 million.
                  It is expected that the SPARK+ Africa Fund will contribute to delivering clean cooking solutions to
               around 2 million households and reduce around 15.9 megatons of CO2 equivalent.

 BOX 2.4

 Promoting interstate trade between Chad and Cameroon

 The construction of a bridge over the Logone River between
 Chad and Cameroon will improve regional development
 and the transport system in the Lake Chad Basin region,
 thus contributing to the development and economic com-
 petitiveness of the cross-border area of the two countries.
    Expected outcomes are strengthened bilateral and sub-
 regional integration, more official trading points on a com-
 mon border of more than 1,000 kilometers, reduced loss of
 life and property during the crossing of the Logone River,
 and strengthened sociocultural exchanges between the
 peoples of the two countries.                                   Bridge over the Logone River between Yagoua

                    Ethiopia: Preserving jobs and small enterprises during and after the
                    COVID-19 pandemic

                    The Ethiopia COVID-19 Crisis Response Budget Support (ECRBS) (UA 120 million ADF grant) supports the
                    government’s efforts to contain the spread of COVID-19 and to mitigate the economic and social impact
                    of the pandemic on local businesses and vulnerable households, particularly the urban poor.
                       The operation will contribute to stabilizing the economy through fiscal support to expand the gov-
                    ernment’s financial ability to protect micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs)—40 percent of
                    which are owned or headed by women and youth—and to preserve about 26,000 jobs. The operation will
                    help 5,000 MSMEs access finance (loans and grants), help an additional 200 businesses benefit from a tax
                    exemption for medical equipment, and support MSME access to financial support through commercial
                    banks benefiting from National Bank of Ethiopia liquidity support.

      In Egypt, a 37-square-kilometer solar park, so large, it can be seen from space

      Thirty international infrastructure developers got behind Egypt’s 1.5 gigawatt Benban solar park in the Aswan
      desert with USD 4 billion in funding. It will be the largest park of its kind in the world upon completion, with over
      7 million photovoltaic panels. Africa50 is one of the largest contributors to the project, with a 25 percent stake.
         Now that the prices of solar energy components have fallen, solar energy has become competitive, allowing
      Benban to become a reality.
         The Benban project, providing clean energy to hundreds of thousands of households, will help Egypt to
      reach its target of generating 20 percent of its power from renewable sources by 2022. It has put Egypt on the
      map as a major solar player in Africa and has set a precedent for using North Africa’s ample solar resources to
      provide power while meeting climate change commitments.

In 2020, Management continued to
implement reforms to move to One
Bank principles and develop policies
and strategies in order to better
serve the Bank’s clients.

The operational model and organizational structure
established under the Development and Business
Delivery Model (DBDM) allowed the Bank to respond
quickly to the COVID-19 challenge, particularly in
streamlining business processes. The changed global
aid architecture and the impact of COVID-19 required a
rethink of development finance and innovative ways to
support Regional Member Countries (RMCs) during the
pandemic. The Bank responded with required policies,
strategies, and programs.
