Welcome message

I am pleased to share with you the 2020 Annual Report of the Plant Production and
Protection Division (NSP).
2020 was marked by extraordinary challenges. COVID-19 shook the world, causing loss of life, compromising livelihoods and disrupting our normal ways of living.
But for many people, this pandemic was just one more hardship – in addition to
poverty, hunger, endemic diseases, conflict, drought, extreme weather events and
many other life-threatening difficulties.
For the fourth year in a row, the number of hungry people around the globe increased, as reported by FAO in The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World.
Plant production was again threatened by biotic and abiotic constraints, including diminishing areas of arable land, water scarcity, decreasing biodiversity, pests,
diseases and extreme weather events.
2020 also brought important change for the Plant Production and Protection
Division. Taking a new name, NSP, it was repositioned under the Partnerships and
Outreach Stream as part of the FAO organizational renewal. NSP has put in place a
five-year communication strategy (2021–2025), as well as a series of transformative
measures to enhance internal management and strategic development. The Division is acting on key issues, such as the promotion
of technology transfer for seed security, agroecology, plant nutrition, sustainable mechanization, urban and peri-urban agriculture,
monitoring and control of desert locust and fall armyworm, and
pesticide risk management.
“Building back better” to a more sustainable and equitable postpandemic world is at the heart of FAO’s new Strategic Framework
2022–2031, with the aim of “leaving no one behind through MORE
efficient, inclusive, resilient and sustainable agri-food systems for
better production, better nutrition, a better environment, and a
better life”.
Under the new Strategic Framework, FAO will make a more distinct
connection between its work and the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly those most relevant to the Organization’s mandate.
By aligning itself more closely to the 2030 Agenda and the United Nations system,

"Plant Production and Protection is at

the core of FAO’s mission. Plants make
up 80 percent of the food we eat and
are responsible for 98 percent of the
oxygen we breathe – without plants,
life as we know it would not exist."

FAO acknowledges that only through holistic, system-wide approaches will it be able to deliver on its mission of ensuring food
security and nutrition for all, both today and in the future.
The United Nations Food Systems Summit (UNFSS) 2021 will give us
a tangible opportunity to put these approaches into action. Other major
global fora, such as the Twenty-sixth session of the Conference of the Parties
to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC COP26)
and the Fifteenth meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on
Biological Diversity (CBD COP15), will also provide such occasion.
Plant production and protection is at the core of FAO’s mission. Plants make up
80 percent of the food we eat and are responsible for 98 percent of the oxygen
we breathe – without plants, life as we know it would not exist. NSP and its wider
global community will play a fundamental role in implementing the new FAO Strategic Framework, particularly in promoting “better production”, and in contributing to its mission of “enabling the transition to more efficient, inclusive, resilient and
sustainable crop production and protection through optimization and minimization”.
2021 is already proving to be another important year for NSP. Under its annual theme, “Ensuring food security and nutrition (SDG 2)”, NSP is leading key initiatives related to the International Year of Fruits and Vegetables, and the celebrations of World Pulses Day and World Bee Day. In addition, the Division will organize
the Global Conference on the Green Development of the Seed Industry, as well
as launch and contribute to the Global Action on Green Development of Special
Agro-Products, the Global Programme on Sustainable Dryland Agriculture, and the
Global Action on Highly Hazardous Pesticides with the World Health Organization
(WHO) and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP).
I am delighted by NSP’s achievements and excited by the direction it is taking. I truly
look forward to working with the Division over the coming year and beyond to build
back better and support sustainable development, together.

Beth Bechdol,

Deputy Director-General,
Food and Agriculture Organization of
the United Nations (FAO)

I

t is my distinct honour to introduce the 2020 Annual Report of the Plant
Production and Protection Division (NSP) — the first ever Annual Report for the
division.
The year 2020 was extraordinary, with unprecedented challenges brought on by
the COVID-19 pandemic. It was also a milestone year for NSP as the Division’s acronym changed from AGP to NSP as a part of the transformation of FAO.
Several noteworthy activities took place in 2020 to help mitigate the impact of
COVID-19 on NSP’s work programme. Policy briefs on Sustainable crop production
and COVID-19 and COVID-19 and the role of local food production in building more
resilient local food systems were published to provide technical advice to stakeholders on actions to mitigate the disruptive effects of COVID-19. Meanwhile, over 700
virtual activities and events were organized at global, regional and nation levels, to
promote a wide range of professional, coordination, communication and management activities.
The most significant milestone for the Division in 2020 was its transformation. The
emphasis for internal management is to move towards a “One Dynamic NSP” by
increasing internal solidarity and external visibility. The Division’s new strategic development aims are to build NSP as the centre of excellence for technology promotion and transformation to support MORE efficient, inclusive, resilient and sustainable plant production and protection through optimization and minimization.
A new NSP communication strategy (2021–2025) was developed by establishing one
annual theme for each year, linked to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
Important progress in 2020 was made in transferring production technology:
(i) 44 Member Nations received support to develop strategies, capacities and tools
for plant conservation, breeding and seed systems; (ii) agroecology practices were
disseminated in 16 countries and 4 regions through capacity building for sustainable
agriculture and land management assessment; and (iii) 47 countries and 43 projects
received technical assistance in implementing protected cultivation systems.

2020
ANNUAL REPORT

Important results in 2020 were also achieved in transferring protection technology:
(i) support to FAO’s efforts to monitor and control desert locust in over 30 affected
countries received USD 211 million in support, protected 4 million metric tonnes of
cereal and secured food for 34 million people; (ii) a new strategy
was launched to implement the FAO Global Action on Fall Armyworm Control by identifying 8 demonstration projects and 53 pilot
countries in Africa, Asia and the Pacific, and the Near East regions;
and (iii) capacity building was strengthened in 89 countries covering important aspects of the pesticide lifecycle, and work was carried out in 15 African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries on minimizing pesticide risks and mainstreaming biodiversity.
Even under the constraints of the pandemic, NSP was at the forefront of communication and advocacy activities for major events,
including the International Year of Plant Health 2020, World Pulses
Day, World Bee Day and World Food Day. The Division also contributed to the successful launch of the International Year of Fruits and
Vegetables (IYFV) in 2021 and started publication of two bimonthly
newsletters: Plant Production and Protection and Fall Armyworm
Control in Action. Several major videos were also produced on subjects including seeds, protected cultivation, sustainable mechanization, conservation agriculture and farmer field schools.
Despite the impact of COVID-19, the Division’s partnerships and network were
strengthened in 2020. The Division actively collaborated with over 180 partners at
global, regional and national levels, covering areas of policy, regulation, research
and academia, education, NGOs and the private sector. The Division also formally
launched its networking mechanism for the NSP Community.
The major achievements of 2020 can in large part be attributed to the strong support and positive contributions of NSP and the entire NSP Community across all regions, as well as to the close cooperation of all NSP partners. Taking this opportunity,
I would like to express sincere gratitude to all of you.
The year 2021 will be another remarkable one for NSP and the NSP Community,
as it will be the first year of implementing NSP’s five-year communication strategy
(2021–2025), with a specific focus in 2021 on “Ensuring food security and nutrition
(SDG 2)”.
I look forward to your continued support and dedication to the NSP vision of
“developing sustainable crop production systems for a world free from hunger”.

"The Division’s new strategic development
aims are to build NSP as the centre of

excellence for technology promotion and

transformation to support MORE efficient,
inclusive, resilient and sustainable plant
production and protection through
optimization and minimization."

The plant production

community

A brief history
FAO’s Plant Production and Protection Division is almost as old as FAO itself!
First established on 22 June 1947 as the Plant Industry Branch, by 1959
it was a full division focusing on crop production, improvement and
protection. During the 1960s–1980s, the Division was broadly structured
on crop and grasslands production services, plant protection service, and
crop ecology and genetic resources. In 1980s–2000s there was an increased
emphasis on fruits and vegetables. And, in 2020, the Division acronym
changed from AGP to NSP, with a renewed focused transformation to MORE
efficient, inclusive, resilient and sustainable plant production and protection
through optimization and minimization.

was placed under a new reporting line to the Deputy Director General for Partnerships and Outreach, Ms Beth Bechdol, as part of an
overall restructuring within FAO in the lead up to a proposed new
Strategic Framework for the Organization (2022–2031). This framework will more closely align the work of FAO and NSP with the goals
of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
NSP continued to be FAO’s reference point for all matters on plant
production and protection, through activities related to seeds, ecosystems-based approaches to agriculture, sustainable crop production intensification, urban and peri-urban agriculture, sustainable mechanization, protection against transboundary pests such
as desert locust and fall armyworm, and reduction of risks related
to pesticides, fertilizers and other chemicals.
While many major events had to be cancelled or held virtually,
strong support from a broad range of stakeholders, and the hard
work and commitment of NSP employees and the NSP Community around the globe, meant the Division still managed to deliver
in the highest professional manner and serve its partners globally,
regionally and nationally. It also made significant progress in many
areas of work.

Mitigation of COVID-19

Sustainable crop production and
COVID-19
INTRODUCTION
The COVID-19 pandemic comes at a time when around 820 million people in the world suffer
from chronic hunger and more than 2 billion are malnourished. Even before the pandemic struck,
the ambitious path that was laid out by the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) was going to
require a concerted effort to stay on track; COVID-19 has fundamentally changed the context in
which Agenda 2030 was being pursued and we now risk a reversal of gains made in the last few
years.
According to projections, world food production will have to increase by 50 percent (over 2012
levels) by 2050. This increase will need to be achieved with the same or fewer inputs under
conditions of widespread land degradation, increasing competition for both land and water and
the uncertainties of climate change. This is the premise for FAO’s work aimed at enabling farmers’
transition to sustainable crop production intensification and diversification. FAO strengthens the
institutional and human capacities of Member Countries – through a combination of standard
setting, policies and regulations on the one hand and field level operational activities on the other.
It does so using the following pillars of sustainable crop production intensification: farming
systems; soil health; crops and varieties; water management; plant protection and the enabling
policies and institutions.
The disruptions to these activities caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, coupled with the ongoing
stresses from transboundary pests and diseases (in particular the current desert locust upsurge)
and the increasing frequency and intensification of erratic weather events due to climate change,
have considerable short-, medium- and long-term consequences. The prevalence of resourcepoor smallholder farmers, significant yield gaps, and suboptimal institutions and enabling policy
regimes characterize the crop production systems of developing Member Countries. These are
the very systems that are the most vulnerable to the effects of this pandemic.
This policy brief is intended for decision-makers in developing Member Countries where food
security and nutrition are underpinned by the outputs of hundreds of millions of smallholder
farmers. It provides guidance on actionable measures for mitigating the effects of the COVID-19
pandemic on crop production to support sustainable food systems, and ultimately enhancing the
resilience of institutions and infrastructure to ensure delivery of safe and nutritious food.

SHORT-TERM IMPACT ON SUSTAINABLE CROP PRODUCTION
The poorest and most vulnerable groups will experience the most negative effects of the current
pandemic. This demographic includes subsistence farmers as well as smallholder farmers’
enterprises.

COVID-19 policy brief
COVID-19 has fundamentally changed the context in which Agenda 2030 is being
pursued, with the risk that gains made in recent years may be reversed. The poorest and most vulnerable groups – including subsistence farmers and smallholder
farmers’ enterprises – will experience the most negative effects of the pandemic. In
April 2020, a policy brief for decision makers in developing Member Nations where
food security and nutrition issues have affected smallholder farmers. The policy brief
highlighted a policy brief was developed for decision makers FAO's commitment to
work with Member Nations, organizations and partners to stabilize food production
and distribution during the COVID-19 crisis. https://doi.org/10.4060/ca8807en

City region food systems
and COVID-19

Farmer field schools:
sharing information &
new practices

COVID-19 disrupted city region food systems (CRFS) worldwide,
posing challenges for cities and local governments obliged to
deal with rapid changes in food availability, affordability and
the food security and nutrition situation of urban populations.
Consequently, a pandemic component was added to the CRFS
programme, with 17 articles and case studies published on the
impact of COVID-19. Based on the information collected, the
CRFS assessment methodology is being modified to include
pandemic-related indicators. CRFS indicators are also contributing to the Green Cities Initiative (GCI) indicator framework.
Policy Brief: Urban food systems and COVID-19: The role of
cities and local governments in responding to the emergency.

The global farmer field school platform responded to the
COVID-19 pandemic by providing ongoing technical support
to countries and projects. A global communication and training campaign was launched to incorporate awareness-raising on COVID-19 into farmer field school programmes, and
to adapt training and extension in the light of the pandemic. A handbook on Running Farmer Field Schools in times of
COVID-19 and multiple posters and national communication
campaigns were released in 10 languages in partnership with
FAO field offices and external partners.

FAO continues to support countries in developing national
seed policies, legislations and/or regulatory frameworks. In
2020, 11 countries were supported in this regard. Seed value chains were strengthened in 30 countries. In five southern African countries, the production of Crop Specific Field
Inspection Manuals was supported along with the promotion of sustainable seed production practices. In Latin
America and the Caribbean, production capacity for quality
legume seeds was strengthened in one country, while three
others were supported with the dissemination of three new
cassava varieties per country.

Conservation of genebanks
In 2020, FAO supported national genebanks to collect,
conserve, regenerate, multiply, characterize and evaluate
crop germplasm. These interventions resulted in sustained
targeted germplasm collection and the expanded conservation of more crops and their wild relatives in four
SADC countries. NSP worked with its partners to support
informed decision-making processes in large germplasm
collections and to develop national genebanks in Organization of Islamic Cooperation Member States. With the support from GEF, technical assistance was provided in Bolivia
(Plurinational State of), Chile, China, Cuba, India, Indonesia,
Mauritania, Mexico, Philippines and Tajikistan on in situ
conservation of PGRFA and managing on-farm diversity.

Seed security
Natural disasters, transboundary pests, conflict and
COVID-19 have increased the vulnerability of millions of
small-scale farmers. Providing access to quality seeds and
productive, nutritious and resilient farmer-preferred crop
varieties is a core part of FAO’s assistance to farmers in
post-crisis situations. In 2020, FAO supported emergency
seed relief activities totalling USD 30 million in 48 countries
through 144 projects.

The Framework for Sustainable Mechanization in Africa
(F-SAMA) was launched, in collaboration with the African
Union Commission, providing guidance, providing
guidance on how to aid the development of sustainable
mechanization in agri-food systems. Together with
NSP partners, capacity building included: developing a
training guide for mechanization hire service providers;
conducting training in seven countries; conducting
high-levels sessions for investors in agricultural mechanization;
and conducting a webinar series on F-SAMA, with
641 participants from 71 countries.

Improving farming, food
and feeding in Mozambique
Through a six-year, EU-funded initiative, the Government
of Mozambique, FAO, WFP and IFAD worked together to
enhance agricultural production, improve access to food and
improve dietary intake and feeding practices in Mozambique.
Project demonstration plots evaluated the adaptability and
performance of maize, rice and bean varieties in terms of
yield, pest and disease resistance, and climate adaptation.
In addition, 72 groups of seed producers were trained in seed
production and seed enterprise development.

Mainstreaming biodiversity
in Africa, Caribbean and
Pacific
FAO is working to mainstream biodiversity into agriculture
with funding from the EU and in collaboration with OACPS
and UNEP. The joint programme will build capacities to overcome the socio-economic and political barriers preventing
countries and farmers from adopting ecosystem-based
agricultural practices and approaches to biodiversity and
chemical management. In 2020, despite restrictions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, the programme managed to validate 6 focus and 19 scale-out countries.

Agroforestry: improving
livelihoods and climate

FAW coordination
The Steering Committee (SC) for the Global Action for FAW Control was established in 2020, chaired by FAO DG with over 20
members from resource, research and development partners
across the globe. The SC is supported by a Technical Committee
(TC) chaired by the chief scientist of USAID with over 30 members from international and national research institutes. During
2020, three SC meetings and three TC meetings were organized.

Innovations and tools to
fight fall armyworm
FAMEWS, a mobile app and global platform to collect and
summarize data on FAW field scouting and pheromone trapping was updated, while FAMEWS data (showing infestation
and prevalence) were integrated into the Tanzania Agrometeorology (TMA) Database. Further, a digital monitoring and
an early warning system was developed for crop diseases and
insect pests in China, as well as a quick-identification tool.

FAO promotes sound
pesticide management
FAO continued to facilitate pesticide risk reduction throughout
all steps of pesticide lifecycle management, including support
to national policies and laws on pesticide management in five
countries, environmental management plans in six countries
and environmental risk assessment reports for six countries,
pilot schemes for empty pesticides containers management in
four countries, plus four international tenders for environmentally sound disposal of more than 900 tonnes of obsolete pesticides. FAO also provided over 100 pesticide clearance requests
from various FAO Country Offices.

Promoting alternatives to
hazardous pesticides
In 2020, teams in four sub-Saharan countries were trained
on promoting safer alternatives to severely hazardous pesticide formulations (SHPFs) using the FFS methodology. In
Rwanda, FFS/IPM training plots demonstrated the effectiveness of botanical pesticides in controlling plant pests and
built strong community awareness on the negative effects of
SHPFs. In Burkina Faso, Mali and Senegal, alternatives to synthetic chemical pesticides were tested, with a market study
carried out to assess the accessibility and profitability of alternative plant protection methods. The most promising alternatives were proposed to farmers through established FFSs.

FAO responds to desert
locust upsurge
In 2020, the worst desert locust upsurge in 25 years
affected 13 countries in East Africa, the Near East and
Southwest Asia. In total, 2 825 000 ha were treated in
22 countries, of which 1 958 000 with direct FAO support
across the ten most affected countries. With USD 194 million
mobilized, FAO supported the affected countries with material, equipment and innovative technologies for aerial and
ground survey and control operations. FAO-supported operations averted the loss of an estimated 3 130 000 tonnes of
cereal in East Africa and Yemen alone – enough grain to feed
21 million people for an entire year.

Innovations in monitoring,
control of desert locust
The 2020 desert locust upsurge necessitated the development and implementation of innovative monitoring and early warning tools, and control systems. The eLocust3 system
was expanded to include mobile phone (eLocust3m) and
GPS (eLocust3g) versions. EarthRanger, a geospatial tracking
system, was modified to manage aerial survey and control
operations in three countries, with all field data made publicly available on the FAO/ESRI Locust Hub. New remote sensing
products were developed to detect soil moisture and guide
survey teams to potential breeding areas. And drones were
deployed so survey teams could monitor larger areas for
breeding conditions and locust infestations.

of Slovenia, the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences
(CAAS) and Apimondia. The “Bee Engaged” theme focused
on apiculture and good practices adopted by beekeepers to
support their livelihoods, deliver quality products and ecosystem services.

2020

The International Year of Plant Health (IYPH) 2020 promoted and recorded 700 events
on plant health globally, which raised awareness of the importance of plant health
among the public and policy makers. The IYPH was launched at a successful face-toface event on 2 December 2019 in the presence of FAO Director-General Qu Dongyu.
The IYPH portal and communication toolkit were also introduced, and are available
at: http://www.fao.org/iyph.
The IYPH increased stakeholder engagement all over the world. Examples include
IYPH airport and tram campaigns in Milan, Italy, IYPH flags flying on public buildings in the Republic of Korea, and the green lighting of landmarks, monuments and
buildings in Canada, Mexico and the United States of America. EPPO launched the
“Beastie the Bug” campaign and rebranded its “Don't Risk It” campaign to highlight
the importance of preventing plant pest introduction when travelling.
Belgium minted 600 000 two-euro coins as regular-issue currency, while Italy and
Mexico minted commemorative coins. 29 countries from all regions issued IYPH commemorative stamps. FAO Governing Bodies endorsed the establishment of an International Day of Plant Health, proposed by Zambia. Lastly, the IYPH saw the launch of
the Scientific Review of the Impact of Climate Change on Plant Pests and the Youth
Declaration on Plant Health, sparking further public interest on the topic.

Plant Production and Protection Newsletter

Launch of the FAO Global Action for Fall Armyworm Control, December 2019

Welcome to the first edition of “Fall Armyworm Control in
Action”, the monthly newsletter of the FAO Global Action for Fall
Armyworm Control. Through this newsletter, we will inform all FAW
key stakeholders about the latest news of the FAO Global Action.
FAW Executive Secretary and NSP Director, Xia Jingyuan

Background
Fall armyworm (FAW, Spodoptera frugiperda) is a pest
originating in the Americas: it can fly over 100 km per day; it
feeds on over 80 hosts; and a female moth can deposit 1 000
eggs during its life.
FAW was first detected in Africa in 2016; since then, the pest
has rapidly spread to the southern hemisphere and has been
reported in more than 70 countries in Africa, Asia-Pacific and
the Near East (Fig. 1).
Due to its voracious nature and broad host range, FAW has
been designated as one of the ten worst pests and diseases
threatening global food security (CABI, 2018) and livelihoods.
FAW has the potential to destroy up to 80 million tonnes of

pre-2016

maize worth USD 18 billion per year, affecting about 600 million
people in Africa, Asia-Pacific and the Near East.
Challenges in mitigating FAW damage include, among others,
lack of the following: coordination at global, regional and

Transformation of FAO
Plant Production and Protection
Internal management and
professional development
With the appointment of Jingyuan Xia as the new Director for NSP, the Division embarked on a process of
internal restructuring based on clearly defined standardization principles. Director Xia stressed the need
to foster a “One Dynamic NSP”, built on strategies to increase internal solidarity and external visibility, and
to promote mindset, management and cultural innovations. It was agreed that approaches should be
people-first, demand-driven, result-oriented and performance-based, all designed to bring positive transformation to NSP. By December 2020, two new sets of standard operating procedures had been adopted to facilitate workflow and clearance procedures (3 SOPs) and to improve quality control (10 SOPs).
A new emphasis was placed on professional development in NSP. Specifically, plans were put in place
to encourage technology promotion and transfer, while focusing on strengthening the two mainstreams
of optimization (of yields, input efficiency, etc.) and minimization (of crop losses, pesticide residual risks,
environmental contamination, etc.). To achieve the two mainstreams, four key technologies were identified: seed technology, cropping technology, protection technology and high technology.

Desert Locust control team
– a success story

AO
©F

The Desert Locust control team has worked tirelessly to rapidly roll out a multi-country desert locust response to tackle the worst upsurge of a generation. The team’s response
has produced significant successes, protecting millions of
people’s livelihoods and food security across the affected regions thanks to cross-cutting strategies and collaborations.
The achievements did not go unnoticed by FAO Director-General Qu Dongyu, who assigned one of the ten team awards to
the Desert Locust control team for the excellent work done
during 2020. The team was proud to receive such recognition and has continued to work hard to improve upon the
achieved successes.

Teamwork

Culture building

NSP underwent important restructuring geared towards
bolstering teamwork and improving working mechanisms
across the Division. The process involved the creation of
three brand-new task forces – Task Force for Communications and Advocacy (TFCA), Task Force on Professional Development (TFPD) and Task Force of Planning and Finance
(TFPF) – and a dedicated Women’s Group and Youth Group.
The initiatives were welcomed as a positive step towards further connecting NSP employees from across different teams
and encouraging a sense of working together for one common goal under difficult circumstances relating to COVID-19.

NSP efforts to support team building in 2020 also extended
to hosting an exciting end-of-year party, organized by the
NSP Youth Group. Games were played, songs were sung –
sometimes badly! – stories were told, and Director Xia took
time to explain to NSP employees the great significance of
the Chinese Year of the Ox, being celebrated in 2021.

Way forward
Dear Reader,
As you can see, we have achieved a lot in 2020, despite the challenging circumstances
brought about by COVID-19. And in 2021 there will be no let-up!
With a new global focus on “building back better”, FAO’s Plant Production and Protection Division (NSP) plans to use this unique opportunity to reaffirm the importance
that plant life on Earth plays in providing food security and nutrition, ecosystems services, livelihoods and a host of other benefits.
NSP will focus its activities for 2021 around the annual theme of “Enabling Food Security and Nutrition”, in line with Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 2. NSP will also
align its work plans with FAO’s proposed new Strategic Framework 2022–2031, which
aims to achieve “MORE efficient, inclusive, resilient and sustainable agri-food systems
for better production, better nutrition, a better environment, and a better life, leaving
no one behind”.

AO
©F

NSP will play a key role in FAO’s contribution to the United Nations Food Systems
Summit – with a pre-Summit in Rome in late July – which aims to increase understanding of the choices that affect the future of agri-food systems and to accelerate
progress toward the SDGs. NSP will lead on FAO’s new Global Action on Green Development of Special Agro-Products: One Country–One Commodity (OCOC), a five-year
initiative that will integrate the economic, social and environmental dimensions of
sustainable development targeted in the United Nations 2030 Agenda. The Division
will also launch the Global Programme on Sustainable Dryland Agriculture, with the
support of other FAO divisions and Decentralized Offices.
NSP will co-lead with other FAO divisions the International Year of Fruits and Vegetables 2021 (IYFV) and, with the IPPC, coordinate activities for the extended International Year of Plant Health 2020 (IYPH), including the IYPH closing ceremony on 1 July. NSP
will lead celebrations for World Pulses Day 2021, the theme of which is “Love pulses
– for a healthy diet and a healthy planet”, and World Bee Day 2021, the theme of which
is “Bee engaged – Build back better for bees”, as well as being a key partner for World
Food Day 2021. NSP will also organize a two-day “Global Conference on Green Development of Seed Industries” at FAO headquarters on 4–5 November 2021.

2020
ANNUAL REPORT

After USD 194 million were mobilized by FAO in 2020 to combat desert locust, NSP
will continue to provide technical support and lead on capacity development in affected countries and develop innovative solutions to the desert locust crisis, including drones for surveillance. Meanwhile, work will continue on implementing regional
integrated pest management (IPM) packages in all eight FAW Global Action demonstration countries (Burkina Faso, Cameroon, China, Egypt,
India, Kenya, Malawi and the Philippines) and developing
capacities for prevention and preparedness in countries
where FAW has not been detected.

"NSP will focus its activities for 2021

around the annual theme of’ Enabling
Food Security and Nutrition’,
in line with SDG 2"

FAO, along with the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the World Health Organization (WHO),
will launch the Action Plan on Highly Hazardous Pesticides
(HHPs). The Action Plan will seek to eliminate harm associated with HHPs, and increase knowledge so that countries can make informed decisions on phasing out problematic pesticides, disseminate knowledge and good
practices, and encourage adoption of non-toxic alternatives to HHPs.
And the Rotterdam Convention Secretariat will continue to reach out with all possible electronic tools to its 164 Parties and ensure the continuous successful delivery
of technical assistance for the sound management of certain hazardous chemicals
and pesticides.
As ever, we will rely on the support of all partners to achieve the best results over the
coming year.
