FOREWORD

The activities encapsulated within this year’s Annual Report are reflective of IOM’s extensive range
and the expertise presented by the Organization’s 12,000 staff around the world.

In 2018, the importance of the work carried out by IOM staff was reaffirmed by the adoption of the
Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration by 152 States across the world. The objectives
set out in the Global Compact highlight the increasing prominence of migration on the political agenda
of many of our Member States and mirror the transversal nature of IOM’s work – cutting across, among
others, environmental, labour, health and security concerns.

But even prior to the adoption of the Global Compact, IOM was actively engaged in supporting
governments in the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, including the
mainstreaming of migration into new or existing United Nations Development Assistance Frameworks.
Indeed, in 2018, IOM assessed the capacity of 16 countries to manage migration through the Migration
Governance Indicators.

During the year, IOM retained and expanded its critical role in emergency response, with crisis-related
programming reaching over 30 million people in more than 100 countries. The Organization activated
or maintained its internal Level 3 mechanism for six emergencies, namely two system-wide
emergencies in the Syrian Arab Republic and Yemen, and four corporate emergencies in Bangladesh,
Iraq, Libya and Nigeria.

As part of the Organization’s role within the United Nations system, IOM staff contributed to the WHO
global action plan on promoting the health of refugees and migrants – launched at the Seventy-second
World Health Assembly – and launched the Global Skills Partnership, in cooperation with the ILO and
UNESCO, among others. In South America, IOM established and co-led, with UNHCR, the Regional
Inter-Agency Coordination Platform for Refugees and Migrants from Venezuela, at the request of the
United Nations Secretary-General.

These partnerships are testimony to IOM’s extraordinary operational capacity, providing support and
services to migrants and vulnerable populations across the globe. In 2018, the combined total revenue
of the Organization, comprising assessed contributions, voluntary contributions and other income,
increased by 15 per cent compared with 2017 and reached USD 1.87 billion.

As we embark upon a new strategic planning process to strengthen the Organization, the Annual
Report for 2018 serves as a reminder of IOM’s existing capacities to drive change and realize positive
impact on the ground, even while the assessed contributions from Member States account for less
than 3 per cent of consolidated revenue. With your support, IOM can realize even greater value, and
make a bigger impact, in the future.




                                                                                      António Vitorino

REPORTING STRUCTURE

1.         As with the previous report, the Annual Report for 2018 groups the Organization’s activities
according to the three principles and three objectives of MiGOF and its corresponding results
framework. The information provided in the present report is again based on the results of the annual
institutional questionnaire. By reporting in this way, the Organization can describe the results achieved
in the field during the year and how these were linked to the supporting structure and processes.


PRINCIPLE 1: ADHERENCE TO INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS AND FULFILMENT OF
MIGRANTS’ RIGHTS

Supporting States’ adherence to international standards

2.        IOM believes that good migration governance requires compliance with international law,
including human rights law, which is reflected in Principle 1 of MiGOF. During 2018, 79 per cent of
IOM offices had projects supporting States’ adherence to international standards or good governance.
Most of these projects involved several relevant ministries and stakeholders, with the most common
ministries to benefit from project activities being immigration/migration ministries.

3.        Seventy-two per cent of IOM offices provided governments with advice to develop and/or
review legislation or policies in adherence to international standards by assessing the level of
compliance (35 offices), providing technical support to improve compliance (56 offices) or consulting
relevant stakeholders on the implementation of international standards (74 offices). For example, in
Albania, Egypt and Kenya, IOM assisted in developing and reviewing national migration policies and
laws to ensure they adhered to international standards and to enable effective implementation of such
standards.

4.         Furthermore, 76 per cent of offices conducted workshops on international standards for
government officials. This included initiatives such as that in Cambodia, where IOM organized and
facilitated workshops in coordination with the government on human trafficking and case
management with a focus on protection and rights. Another example was in Jordan, where
IOM conducted training for front-line border guards on international standards and human rights to
address protection issues during the mass movement of potentially vulnerable refugees and migrants.

5.       With regard to engagement with governments, civil society and the private sector,
IOM offices especially focused on activities in the areas of human trafficking, the rights of migrant
workers, migrant smuggling, and the protection of children and/or families.

6.        Eighty-five offices reported that they had used the IOM manual, Rights-based approach to
programming, while 105 offices had incorporated the principles into their programming by way of
participation of various stakeholders, particularly beneficiaries (95 offices), non-discrimination
(92 offices), accountability (86 offices) and transparency (85 offices).

A principled approach in the Organization

7.        IOM is also committed to adhering to international standards in its work, which is a pillar of
organizational effectiveness. The Organization follows a series of human rights-based, migrant-centred
principles, intrinsic to all operations and staff values. In this respect, IOM has adopted several policies
that have yielded the following results.

Principles for Humanitarian Action

8.        Principled humanitarian action is an organization-wide commitment. IOM’s humanitarian
policy (C/106/CRP/20) and accompanying operational guidance materials and frameworks ensure that
the Organization’s response to humanitarian crises is guided by humanitarian principles, norms and
professional standards. Humanity, impartiality, neutrality and independence are the core
humanitarian principles that make it easier to secure and maintain safe access to those in need of
humanitarian assistance, to navigate humanitarian dilemmas, to enhance protective programming,
and to manage uncertainty and risk in challenging and unstable operating environments.

9.        In 2018, to meet its humanitarian commitments and deliver effective, safe and accountable
assistance in contemporary crisis contexts, IOM embarked on institutional collaboration with the
International Association of Professionals in Humanitarian Assistance and Protection. As part of a
multi-annual capacity-strengthening initiative, IOM staff started to pursue general and specialized
professional humanitarian certifications through the Association’s practice-based Credentialing
Program. Forty IOM staff members earned one or several Credentialing Program certifications in 2018,
and all certified individuals received a digital badge containing their credentials and certifications.
Furthermore, sessions on principled humanitarian action and IOM’s institutional humanitarian policy
and operational guidelines were included in targeted emergency response training and IOM Chiefs of
Mission training. Learning resources in several languages were uploaded onto the IOM learning
management system, I-Learn.

10.       Cognizant of the need to uphold a principled approach to protection work in crisis response,
the Organization invested in additional internal guidance materials and training initiatives in line with
its commitment and adherence to the IASC Statement on the Centrality of Protection in Humanitarian
Action, as defined in the IASC Policy on Protection in Humanitarian Action.

11.       Through its annual humanitarian consultations and ongoing collaboration with operational
NGO partners globally, during 2018 IOM continued to invest in principled humanitarian partnerships
that seek to build complementarity and synergies for better response.

12.        Principled humanitarian action is central to addressing challenges to effective aid delivery in
complex security environments, where humanitarian access difficulties, including the deliberate
targeting of humanitarian workers and assets, may impede the ability to reach those most in need with
vital aid. Demonstrating IOM’s commitment to gaining and maintaining humanitarian access, 75 IOM
offices responding to humanitarian needs in complex security environments reported that the
IOM Principles for Humanitarian Action guided their strategies and decision-making; for example, in
discussions with donors that apply geographical restrictions on the delivery of assistance (e.g. owing
to counter-terrorism legislation), or for transparent priority-setting and gaining acceptance by all
relevant parties. Moreover, in 2018, IOM promoted respect for humanitarian principles in such
settings, for example in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Nigeria and Yemen. Awareness-raising and
capacity-building efforts included those with government counterparts and implementing partners.

Gender

13.       One hundred and forty-four offices reported that gender equality considerations had been
mainstreamed in their projects during 2018. Moreover, 6 offices reported that they had implemented
a project whose main objective had been gender equality, while 10 offices reported that gender
equality had been a target component of a project.
-----------------------Page 10 End-----------------------

                                                                                                 C/110/4
                                                                                                  Page 3


14.        Several offices promoted women’s participation in law enforcement, border management
and peacebuilding, including in Afghanistan, Belarus, Liberia, Niger, Tajikistan and Viet Nam. In Iraq,
male and female police officers were trained on gender-sensitive policing, and in Somalia, gender
sensitivity was promoted in the National Programme on Disengaged Combatants.

15.       Over 60 offices reported that they had contributed to preventing and/or responding to
gender-based violence. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, IOM set up community-level conflict-
resolution mechanisms that work in collaboration with justice entities, as well as mobile legal clinics in
hard-to-reach areas, which have facilitated access to justice for survivors of gender-based violence. In
Bulgaria and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, mobile protection teams led to better
identification of cases of gender-based violence and improved the referral of survivors to appropriate
medical services.

16.        Some offices also contributed to increased attendance rates of female students in school. In
Jordan, this was achieved by providing school transportation to children in Azraq Refugee Camp; in
South Sudan, this was achieved through the provision of dignity kits for school-age girls in more than
six locations in the country.

17.       Other offices, including those in Austria, Bulgaria and Croatia, covered topics on gender
equality in training on intercultural competencies for relevant officials, such as asylum authorities, and
in orientation courses for migrants receiving resettlement assistance.

18.       As of 2018, at least one gender focal point had been appointed in approximately 85 per cent
of the Organization’s regional and country offices. The offices are also bolstered by continuous support
from Headquarters, which, in 2018, included the development and dissemination of guidance material
for addressing gender in evaluations and the organization of in-person and online training sessions on
gender.

19.       Some offices had also engaged in gender-related research initiatives in order to contribute
to the evidence base and thus promote interventions supported by research. In China, research was
conducted on female migrant domestic workers within the country. In Kazakhstan, a study was carried
out on the needs and rights of women and girls affected by migration. Moreover, a research project in
the Federated States of Micronesia examined the effects of natural disasters on the health and security
of women and girls, an under-studied topic for which limited data are available.

Protection from sexual exploitation and abuse

20.        IOM has a zero-tolerance policy towards sexual exploitation and abuse. Operationalizing this
concept for IOM staff worldwide requires that: all staff understand what appropriate behaviour is; all
staff understand what PSEA means; and all staff know how to report allegations of misconduct. Zero
tolerance works only with a proactive, constant and repeated training programme. The Organization’s
policy has thus been conveyed to its staff on repeated occasions. A session to raise awareness on PSEA
is included in the IOM induction package, and all staff must complete the online ethics and conduct
training, “The Values We Share”, which has a module on sexual exploitation and abuse. By the end of
2018, 13,634 staff and non-staff had completed this training since its launch in 2017.

21.       To meet accountability and transparency requirements, and to ensure that IOM remains at
the forefront of the fight against sexual exploitation and abuse, the work of the IOM Headquarters
Task Force on the Prevention of Sexual Exploitation and Abuse was given renewed impetus in the first
-----------------------Page 11 End-----------------------

C/110/4
Page 4


half of 2018. The Task Force is a forum for interdepartmental collaboration on PSEA, strengthening
PSEA commitments and their implementation at all levels of the Organization.

22.       Furthermore, IOM Chiefs of Mission have the responsibility to ensure that PSEA training
sessions are regularly organized in their offices. Accordingly, 4,827 IOM staff received face-to-face
training on PSEA in 2018.

                      Number of staff who received face-to-face PSEA training




23.       In July 2018, after the then Director General stepped down from his role as IASC Champion
on PSEA, the Executive Director of UNICEF became the IASC Champion on Sexual Exploitation and
Abuse and Sexual Harassment. Following this change, IOM continued to lead global efforts to advance
inter-agency PSEA initiatives and to help institutionalize and strengthen inter-agency PSEA leadership
and coordination. IOM continued to be an active member of the IASC Task Team on Accountability to
Affected Populations and Protection from Sexual Exploitation and Abuse and to conduct IASC official
liaison with the United Nations Sexual Exploitation and Abuse Working Group, advocating for the
harmonization of United Nations and IASC protocols and guidance on PSEA responsibilities.

24.       IOM continued to exercise its unique mandate in providing technical assistance on request
to in-country PSEA networks and humanitarian country teams/United Nations country teams on
collective PSEA activities. In 2018, IOM provided tailored technical assistance to 26 in-country teams
aiming at establishing and implementing collective PSEA structures, such as inter-agency
community-based complaint mechanisms.

25.       The Organization also created and conducted three regional training of trainers sessions for
East Africa, the Middle East and North Africa and West and Central Africa. The training was aimed at
capacitating PSEA network co-chairs and coordinators in collective PSEA activities.

26.       The number of PSEA activities carried out by country offices increased in 2018. Forty-eight
offices were part of an in-country network or task force on PSEA in 2018 compared with 33 in 2017;
and of these, IOM co-chaired the PSEA in-country network in seven countries (Brazil, Chile, Djibouti,
Norway, Philippines, Sierra Leone, Somalia) compared with five in 2017. IOM country offices also
responded to requests for technical support on PSEA from the humanitarian country team or
United Nations country team in 13 countries. Moreover, 41 country offices reported that they had
participated in an inter-agency complaint or feedback mechanism, compared with 26 in 2017.

Accountability to affected populations

27.      Consistent with the IASC commitments to AAP and the commitments to the Grand Bargain,
the AAP framework was piloted in three fragile contexts, namely north-east Nigeria, South Sudan and
Turkey (for whole-of-Syria operations), to support IOM offices in improving accountability
mechanisms. Over 100 IOM staff across the Organization were trained on basic AAP approaches to
enhance beneficiary and local stakeholder engagement in decision-making processes. Increased
awareness and technical consultations on the AAP framework also resulted in an improved integration
of AAP principles in country strategies and humanitarian programming, for example in Libya,
South Sudan, Turkey and Yemen.

28.        The good practice of sharing relevant information about the Organization and its assistance
programmes with diverse groups of people, using multiple communication channels, was continued.
Beneficiaries were consulted at various stages of the programme cycle, with regular consultations
occurring during implementation and monitoring. In countries such as Ethiopia and Myanmar, regular
consultations helped ensure assistance was provided appropriately according to the community’s
culture and values. In others, for example South Sudan, suggestion/complaint boxes were used in all
the static clinics where feedback was actively solicited through satisfaction surveys. This good practice
seeks to gauge the satisfaction of the beneficiaries of IOM assistance and services to guide the
continuous improvement of IOM programming. The Organization further explored innovative
approaches in challenging, remote-management contexts such as in Turkey, where it used technology
in its post-distribution monitoring to receive feedback from the assisted people of the northern
Syrian Arab Republic.

29.       Lastly, IOM contributed to common efforts for the collective accountability of humanitarian
actors by participating in inter-agency initiatives at the country and headquarters levels.


PRINCIPLE 2: EVIDENCE AND A WHOLE-OF-GOVERNMENT APPROACH

Strengthening production and analysis of migration data and evidence

30.      Migration policies should be based on evidence and robust analysis. To help support this,
IOM undertakes applied research and analysis, and many of its publications have become leading
reference reports on migration, drawing on a range of migration statistics, including IOM data. In 2018,
for example, the latest edition of the Organization’s flagship publication, the World Migration Report
2018, became the most downloaded IOM publication of all time with over 215,000 downloads. This
was thanks to the new format which focused on a much broader coverage of key data and information
on migration and on complex and emerging issues. The Report, initially published in English, has since
been translated into Arabic, Chinese, French and Spanish.

31.       In 2018, IOM remained dedicated to enhancing knowledge on migration. The Organization
produced 176 new publications and uploaded 181 onto the IOM Bookstore. During the year, total
downloads of publications on the IOM Bookstore totalled 2,125,684, indicating a high level of interest
in IOM research, data and knowledge on migration. Such interest is also evident from the 3,996 times
IOM was mentioned in all research publications that came out in 2018 and were listed on Google
Scholar. Noteworthy publications included Migration and the 2030 Agenda, Global Migration
Indicators 2018, and Migrant Smuggling Data and Research (Volume 2). IOM also curated the
Migration Transformation Map in partnership with the World Economic Forum, undertaking three
updates of the Map to ensure data and information remained current.

32.      In 2018, 112 offices published or completed studies, research papers, analyses or
assessments for external distribution. The main target audience of publications were government
counterparts, as reported by 105 offices. Displacement tracking was the most prevalent topic as
reported by 39 offices, although studies more generally covered a wide range of topics, including
migrant health, return migration, human trafficking and child labour. For example, the IOM Office in
Serbia produced a handbook on international and European standards in the field of asylum and
migration to support their application in Serbia; and the IOM Office in Cameroon produced a feasibility
study on the extension of social security to Cameroonians living in Belgium.

33.      To ensure high-quality research and analysis, IOM Headquarters provided technical
assistance on research to IOM offices worldwide. In 2018, 38 research project documents were
reviewed. Research guidance notes were also issued on managing migration research projects,
managing research stakeholder relations, reviewing executive summaries and plagiarism. These
research guidance notes were disseminated to offices and made available to IOM staff on the intranet.

34.        In addition, IOM worked in close cooperation with academic institutions and migration
researchers. The Migration Research @Lunchtime seminars continued to be held at Headquarters,
where experts are invited to present their work and discuss issues relevant to migration policy and
practice. In total, 80 IOM offices partnered with academic institutions, with 51 collaborating through
research. For example, in Guatemala, the partnership with a research institution led to a survey on the
welfare of children, adolescents and youth in the country. Other activities carried out in partnership
with research institutions included conducting training, seminars and courses and drawing up
curricula.

35.       IOM continued to work with its partners to develop the evidence base on human trafficking.
A new version of the IOM Counter-Trafficking Data Collaborative was launched in 2018. The first global,
open-access data hub on human trafficking, it combines the three largest victims of human trafficking
data sets in the world, resulting in one centralized data set with information on over 90,000 cases,
representing people of 172 nationalities exploited in 169 countries. Data stories are published to
highlight notable trends and showcase the broad potential for analysis. New data stories in 2018
provided insights on abduction, trafficking routes and male victims of sexual exploitation. An
anonymized data set can be downloaded by researchers. The Counter-Trafficking Data Collaborative
website had been live for less than a year but already attracted over 4,000 users per month, with the
number of users increasing by 10 per cent each month. Up to 50 per cent of users were academics or
students. Other users included the public sector, the private sector, international organizations, NGOs
and media.

36.       IOM worked with several other partners, including governmental and non-governmental
actors, to include their data on the site. It also developed partnerships with academia, the private
sector, United Nations agencies (e.g. the ILO, UNICEF and the United Nations Office on Drugs and
Crime), NGOs and governments to put the data to use for research and other purposes aimed at
eliminating trafficking in persons, such as mapping risks in global supply chains.

37.       The Organization continued to systematically collect migration data through the DTM and
other tools for global use. The IOM migrant case management system (MiMOSA) underwent a major
upgrade in 2018 which included the development of a mobile version (MiMOSA Mobile) to allow
functionality in areas of poor internet connectivity; a new reintegration module to track and measure
progress in reintegration programming; and a vulnerable migrant module to allow for the collection
and management of data on migrants in situations of vulnerability who fall outside the victim of
trafficking classification. Over 400 colleagues from 92 country offices were trained on the new
functionalities and mobile application.

                                                                                               C/110/4
                                                                                                Page 7


Whole-of-government approach to migration

38.       IOM supports a whole-of-government approach to migration, given the cross-cutting nature
of the issue. Interventions are focused on building the capacity of governments to integrate migration
into their development planning processes and to ensure policy coherence. With IOM now part of the
United Nations system, and with migration at the top of the international policy agenda, the demand
for robust policy advice and guidance on migration continues to grow significantly. The capacity of the
Organization to provide that support to governments is therefore of growing importance.

Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration

39.      IOM remained closely engaged in the process to develop and adopt the Global Compact for
Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration. The support IOM provided to the Global Compact process
throughout the year was geared towards the promotion of informed and in-depth exchange and
evidence-based dialogue on migration issues among the Member States and with relevant
stakeholders.

40.       In February, the Global Compact negotiations phase started which comprised six rounds of
intergovernmental negotiations and ended in July. IOM provided extensive support to the
Member States and non-governmental stakeholders throughout the negotiations. This support
included organizational and logistical assistance for the negotiations themselves (e.g. facilitating the
participation of representatives from developing countries) and responding to requests for advice on
thematic issues under negotiation. The Organization also provided significant support to civil society
to engage in the Global Compact process; for example, through facilitating the travel of civil society
representatives to enable their participate in the negotiations and other Global Compact-related
events and meetings. This approach had a direct impact on civil society’s ability to engage in the
Global Compact process in a coordinated and coherent manner and contributed to producing a final
text that gives due recognition to civil society’s important role in supporting implementation of the
Global Compact. These activities were supported financially by, among others, Norway, the
Netherlands and the European Commission.

41.       IOM support to the Global Compact process in 2018 was a truly whole-of-organization
undertaking and was not limited to efforts undertaken by staff in Geneva and New York. Over 120 IOM
offices engaged with their host governments in support of the Global Compact, including in many
instances by facilitating the convening of national multi-stakeholder consultations. This engagement
was often across multiple agencies and sought to highlight the important opportunity afforded by the
Global Compact in the areas of migration governance and international cooperation. Furthermore,
63 country offices engaged with non-State actors on the Global Compact, including academia, think
tanks, migrant and diaspora organizations and the private sector.

42.       The Organization was also engaged in the Global Compact process through established
United Nations structures at the country and regional levels – including United Nations country teams
– and bilateral cooperation with other United Nations agencies and United Nations Regional
Commissions. The extent of this engagement underscores the importance of coordinated
United Nations system action in support of Member States on the Global Compact, which will be
further enhanced and institutionalized through the United Nations Network on Migration and ongoing
United Nations reforms.

43.     The negotiations culminated with the adoption of the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and
Regular Migration at the Intergovernmental Conference held in Marrakesh, Morocco, on 10 and
11 December. IOM worked closely with the Office of the Special Representative of the
-----------------------Page 15 End-----------------------

Secretary-General for International Migration, including by seconding staff to work in her Office, and
the Government of Morocco to ensure the success of the Conference and the many related events in
Morocco immediately before the Conference.

2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development

44.        IOM is committed to the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development
and has embarked on a whole-of-organization effort to use this multilateral development framework
as a pillar of its work. In 2018, the publication Migration and the 2030 Agenda was launched as a key
policy tool to help national and local government actors to incorporate migration aspects in activities
to implement the SDGs. The Organization also began the process of drawing up a migration and
sustainable development strategy, anchored in the 2030 Agenda. The strategy will support a
whole-of-organization approach to more comprehensively integrate migration and development
policy and programming within IOM’s work and the broader United Nations development system.

45.       Over 100 IOM field offices supported their partner governments with the implementation of
the 2030 Agenda. This support took a variety of forms, for example capacity-building on how migration
relates to the SDGs; mainstreaming migration into new or existing UNDAFs; and the development of
SDG target indicators relating to migration. For example, in the Republic of Moldova, IOM supported
the development of the National Development Strategy 2030, ensuring that it was aligned with
migration-related SDG targets. In Egypt, IOM supported the Ministry of Planning to enhance its
sustainable development strategy by including migration and migration governance issues. Other
resulting good practices included the formulating of an annual joint workplan for Afghanistan under
the One Programme which includes indicators measuring the implementation of migration-related
outputs. The Gambia drafted national migration policy in line with the call made in target 10.7 for
Member States to adopt migration policies. Also, in Tunisia the National Observatory on Migration
initiated a process, in collaboration with the IOM country office, to identify relevant SDG targets on
migration for national development priorities.

46.       To support Alliance 8.7 – a global partnership established to assist United Nations
Member States to achieve SDG target 8.7 – IOM launched the Action Group on Migration, which it
co-chairs with UNICEF. The Organization also provided continuous support to the Secretariat of
Alliance 8.7 and the broader membership.

Integrating migration into development and other sectoral policies

47.       By including migration in development and other sectoral policies, Member States will be
better equipped to meet global targets, including the SDG targets. In 2018, 93 IOM offices supported
their partner national and local governments to mainstream migration into development or sectoral
policy revision, planning and implementation. IOM mainly collaborated with key sectors/ministries,
such as health (32 offices), employment (28 offices), social protection (31 offices) and development
(40 offices). This support included training government officials, technical assistance, secondment of
experts to government institutions and supporting inter-agency cooperation. Resulting good practices
included the finalization of the national diaspora policy of Zambia, to be launched in 2019, and the
development of the new national displacement policy of Vanuatu. The IOM–UNDP Global Joint
Programme on Mainstreaming Migration into National Development Strategies also contributed to
good practices by national governments.

48.      In Morocco, IOM supported the development of a national strategy on health and
immigration which was integrated into the new National Action Plan for Health and to be rolled out in
three target regions through the development of regional strategies. In the Republic of Moldova,
migration was integrated into the National Employment Strategy and Action Plan 2017–2021.

                                                                                                  C/110/4
                                                                                                   Page 9


49.       In Ecuador, IOM supported the government in developing a national human mobility law and
a plan for its implementation. The law and implementation plan reflect the country’s commitment to
strengthen the protection of the rights of migrants and displaced persons and advocate for their
integration in communities. They also transfer competencies to provincial and municipal authorities in
areas related to migration governance, recognizing their key role in this regard. IOM also provided
support to the Government of Albania for the development of a national strategy and action plan on
migration governance, which are compliant with MiGOF and the Migration Governance Indicators
process.

Enhancing governments’ capacity to formulate sound migration policies

50.      IOM is committed to supporting both national and local governments in addressing the
challenges and maximizing the opportunities that migration brings to countries and communities. To
achieve this, it encourages a whole-of-government approach.

51.        In 2018, the Migration Governance Indicators, a set of 90 indicators, helped additional
countries to assess the comprehensiveness of their migration policies. IOM organized interministerial
consultations to discuss the results of the assessment in 16 countries, reaching over 600 government
officials. The results were used to inform the development of migration strategies and policies
(e.g. Albania), report progress on implementation of the SDGs (e.g. the Dominican Republic) and
establish plans of action for implementing the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration
(e.g. Republic of Moldova).

52.       Lastly, in May, IOM adapted the Migration Governance Indicators to the local level to offer a
more comprehensive picture of a country’s migration governance landscape and to strengthen IOM’s
partnerships with local authorities. This exercise, known as the Local MGI process, aims to foster the
dialogue on migration between national governments and local authorities and enable local
authorities to share common challenges and identify potential solutions. The pilot phase of the Local
MGI process included three cities: Accra, Ghana; Montreal, Canada; and São Paulo, Brazil.


PRINCIPLE 3: PARTNERSHIPS

Global partnerships on migration

53.       Global partnerships on migration come in many different forms, but all such initiatives have
the same goal: to address migration issues at the global level. Seventy-five IOM offices reported that
in 2018 they had actively engaged in global partnerships on migration. Most partnerships had focused
on the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration, the 2030 Agenda, the IDM, the GFMD
and initiatives to assist migrants in crisis contexts.

54.       Fifty-nine offices reported that global partnerships helped to increase common
understanding of migration issues among participating States and to harmonize positions. Forty-seven
offices reported having supported the organization of policy dialogue and events leading to a more
integrated and inclusive approach to migration and mobility issues. Also, 44 offices formed
partnerships with stakeholders in both the public and private sectors to support the implementation
and review of the migration-related SDGs.

55.      IOM also collaborated with the United Nations Major Group for Children and Youth and
UNICEF to organize the Youth Forum held on 8 and 9 December in Marrakech, Morocco, which brought
together more than 150 youth participants from over 50 countries. The Forum involved varied
discussions focusing on youth priorities, such as trafficking, social media, protection and rights of youth
migrants, education, access to jobs and skills training.
-----------------------Page 17 End-----------------------

C/110/4
Page 10


56.      The following sections describe IOM engagement and the outcomes of two global processes
on migration, namely the GFMD and the IDM.

Global Forum on Migration and Development

57.       A total of 17 IOM offices engaged in the GFMD in 2018. Engagement also included technical
secondments. For example, IOM seconded a special adviser to the Moroccan co-chair in Rabat, in
response to the Government’s request for technical assistance. IOM Headquarters, in coordination
with the IOM Office in Rabat, also supported the Moroccan co-chair with the formulation of the annual
concept note and background papers on thematic areas, such as aligning governance with drivers of
migration, migrants’ engagement with public services and South–South mobility.

International Dialogue on Migration

58.       Under the theme of “Inclusive and innovative partnerships for effective global governance of
migration”, two IDM sessions were held, one in New York on 26 and 27 March, and one in Geneva on
8 and 9 October. The two sessions brought together more than 600 participants, including ministers
and other high-level government officials, heads of agencies and NGOs, civil society and the business
community for a rich discussion on the centrality of partnerships for global migration governance
efforts and to present tools and initiatives to strengthen capacity development. The combined report
of the two sessions is contained in IDM Red Book No. 28.

59.       Reporting country offices affirmed that their engagement in the IDM enhanced their work
and collaboration with government counterparts. They also confirmed that the best practices,
recommendations and tools presented at the IDM were relevant for the activities they carried out in
the field. Many offices reported that the IDM contributed to increased understanding of migration
issues among governments and stakeholders at the local and national levels, cross-border
collaboration, alignment of national policies with global policies, capacity-building, changes in
migration management practices and promotion of policy dialogue at national and regional level.

60.        For example, in Malawi, the IDM outcomes contributed to the validation of the national
action plan and mechanism on identification, referral and protection of vulnerable migrant groups and
efforts to implement the Diaspora Engagement Policy. In Burkina Faso, the IDM supported the National
Diaspora Forum organized by the Government in July, and in Kenya it facilitated the development of
the National Migration Policy. Also, in Georgia, the participation of the Government in the IDM led to
the creation of an action plan for the country’s migration strategy; in Uganda, it supported the National
Coordination Mechanism for Migration, which fosters collaboration between ministries and with
academia and civil society on migration data, migration and development. The IDM outcomes also
supported the efforts of the Government of Jamaica to expand the National Working Group on
International Migration and Development to implement strategies to prevent, address and resolve
migrant vulnerability.

61.       The discussions and outcomes of the 2018 IDM helped to shape the migration agenda in
several countries, promoting good practices in migration policy and migration management. In
Ethiopia, the country office reported that the IDM outcome documents are important reference points
for the Government in prioritizing migration in their national agenda/programming. Similarly, the
Government of Italy considers recommendations made at the IDM in their national migration
programming and development cooperation financing.

62.      Furthermore, it was reported that the IDM and its outcomes promoted IOM activities, such
as: migration profiles, regional frameworks in the Pacific on migration and climate change issues,
-----------------------Page 18 End-----------------------

                                                                                                 C/110/4
                                                                                                 Page 11


implementation of MiGOF, border management, mainstreaming migration into national development
agendas and the promotion of cooperation on diaspora matters.

IOM support to inter-State consultation mechanisms on migration

63.       Inter-State consultation mechanisms on migration are State-led, ongoing information-
sharing and policy dialogues at the regional, interregional or global level for States with an interest in
promoting cooperation in the field of migration. They may be officially associated with formal regional
institutions or be informal and non-binding. At the global level, they are known as global processes on
migration, for example the GFMD and the IDM (see previous sections). At the regional level, they are
referred to as regional consultative processes on migration, with those connecting two or more regions
being known as interregional forums on migration (see relevant sections below).

64.       IOM is a member of 4 and observer to 16 inter-State consultation mechanisms on migration.
Upon Member States’ request, it serves as technical secretariat to 11 and manages secretariat support
projects for another 6; it administratively hosts three secretariats (GFMD, the Intergovernmental
Consultations on Migration, Asylum and Refugees, and the Regional Conference on Migration – also
known as the Puebla Process). IOM support includes technical expertise, policy guidance, research,
capacity-building and targeted project initiatives.

65.      In 2018, IOM worked to strengthen its partnerships by hosting discussion calls on inter-State
consultation mechanisms on migration for IOM colleagues in offices in Kazakhstan and Addis Ababa
and the Regional Office in San José.

Regional and interregional partnerships on migration

66.      Regional and interregional bodies and forums are vital actors in improving international
migration governance. They provide a space for relevant stakeholders to come together to discuss
policy matters and areas for collaboration with a view to addressing migration issues.

Regional and interregional inter-State consultation mechanisms on migration

67.       Regional and interregional inter-State consultation mechanisms on migration come under
two categories: regional consultative processes on migration and interregional forums on migration.
As with the global processes on migration, they are both State-led consultation mechanisms that may
allow the participation of non-State actors, such as intergovernmental organizations, NGOs and civil
society.

•        Regional consultative processes on migration

68.       Seventy-seven IOM offices reported having worked with a number of regional consultative
processes on migration. The most common types of engagement included facilitation of meetings,
technical advice, capacity-building, participation in meetings or events, technical secretariat support,
and data collection, analysis and sharing.

69.       As a result of their engagement, 49 offices reported an increased common understanding of
migration issues among participating States and harmonization of positions across the region. Offices
reported that their engagement had contributed to: the adoption of regional policies or strategies
(13 offices); the establishment of national focal points/national officers, other institutional set-ups or

working groups (13); and to enhanced technical capacity and changes in legislation, policies or
practices governing how migration is managed at the national and/or regional levels (13). Other
-----------------------Page 19 End-----------------------

C/110/4
Page 12


outcomes included support to implement and review migration-related SDGs; harmonization of
national policy with regional policies; harmonization of national/regional legislation; cross-fertilization
with global processes on migration; greater understanding of how to mainstream gender into regional
consultative processes on migration. For instance, the IOM Office in Zambia mentioned strengthened
linkages between regional and national initiatives, particularly on data and policy.

70.      In the Americas, IOM established and co-led, with UNHCR, the Regional Inter-Agency
Coordination Platform for Refugees and Migrants from Venezuela, at the request of the United Nations
Secretary-General. The platform convenes almost one hundred partners to facilitate a coherent and
well-coordinated analysis of, strategic planning for and operational response to the large-scale
movement and situation of Venezuelan nationals in Latin America and the Caribbean.

71.       In 2018, IOM published The Role of Inter-State Consultation Mechanisms on Migration in the
Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration. The aim of this review was to identify the
potential contribution of inter-State consultation mechanisms on migration to the attainment of the
commitments contained in the Global Compact and the potential complementarities and added value
of their engagement.

•         Interregional forums on migration

72.      Thirty-three IOM offices reported having engaged with interregional forums on migration in
2018. These forums included the Bali Process on People Smuggling, Trafficking in Persons and Related
Transnational Crime (11 offices) and the Pan-African Forum on Migration (6 offices).

73.       The most common forms of engagement were facilitating meetings among Member States
and the provision of technical advice and capacity-building. For example, through its engagement in
the Bali Process, the IOM Office in Australia was able to brief Australian businesses on corporate
responsibility in combating modern slavery.

Intergovernmental organizations

74.      The Organization continued to forge strong bilateral partnerships with other United Nations
agencies and international actors in fields such as emergency response, health, migration data, refugee
resettlement, migration and the environment, labour migration, child protection, trade, economic
development, human trafficking and border management. In 2018, 87 formal cooperation agreements
were signed with intergovernmental organizations on joint programme implementation, funding,
access to communities/areas, and policymaking and review. IOM signed seven memorandums of
understanding in 2018: three with intergovernmental organizations (Word Customs Organization,
Organization of American States, African Development Bank) and four with United Nations agencies
(FAO, World Bank, United Nations Volunteers, UNDP).

75.      Consistent with its prominent role in country-level cluster and inter-agency coordination
responsibilities, IOM continued to be an active member of 61 clusters, sectors, working groups and
coordination platforms across 37 countries.

76.       Since its entry into the United Nations system, IOM has been proactively involved in some
inter-agency networks. It is the co-lead of the Global CCCM Cluster and played a strong role in the
Strategic Advisory Group of the Global Shelter Cluster. It continued to lead the Gender-based Violence
in Shelter Programming Working Group and the Shelter Projects Working Group and co-led the

Inclusion of Persons with Disabilities in Shelter Programming Working Group. IOM has an active
representation in the Global Protection Cluster, the Child Protection Area of Responsibility and the
-----------------------Page 20 End-----------------------

                                                                                                C/110/4
                                                                                                Page 13


Alliance for Child Protection in Humanitarian Action. IOM also chaired the Unaccompanied and
Separated Children Task Force, a position it continues to hold.

77.       In the area of human trafficking, IOM co-leads the Anti-Trafficking Task Team of the Global
Protection Cluster. In 2018, IOM played an active role in the annual Global Protection Cluster
Conference. The Organization was also re-elected to chair the Inter-Agency Working Group on
Unaccompanied and Separated Children, and is also an active member of other work streams and task
forces, notably the Child Labour Task Force of the Alliance for Child Protection in Humanitarian Action.
IOM continued to take an active role in the Inter-Agency Coordination Group against Trafficking in
Persons, which published two issue briefs in 2018: Trafficking in Children; and The Role of the
Sustainable Development Goals in Combating Trafficking in Persons.

78.      In early 2018, the IASC commenced a review of its structures to ensure they remained fit for
purpose and reflected the IASC Principals’ Strategic Priorities. As a full and active member of the IASC,
IOM actively contributed to the architecture reform process, which was completed in late 2018.

79.     IOM also continued to engage in other entities associated with the IASC, including the
Humanitarian Programme Cycle Steering Group and the Reference Group on Mental Health and
Psychosocial Support in Emergency Settings. In August, IOM became a member of the Inter-Agency
Humanitarian Evaluations Steering Group.

80.       In its efforts to reduce the risks of gender-based violence in emergency settings,
IOM partnered with clusters and agencies, including the Global CCCM Cluster, the Global Shelter
Cluster, the Gender-based Violence Area of Responsibility, the Women’s Refugee Commission and the
Norwegian Refugee Council.

81.       The Organization also continued its active participation in the Inter-Agency Working Group
on Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration, including the efforts under way to update the
relevant standards and provide guidance on disarmament, demobilization and reintegration processes
in contexts of ongoing or protracted conflict and violent extremism.

82.       In 2018, partnerships on protection were strengthened, notably with different international
NGOs on community-based protection monitoring (e.g. in Bangladesh); on translation for increased
participation (e.g. north-east Nigeria); and on best interests procedures for migrant children with
UNICEF, UNHCR and international NGOs in various contexts. Partnerships were also strengthened with
other United Nations agencies (e.g. United Nations Population Fund), peacekeeping missions,
international and national NGOs and local authorities.

United Nations Development Assistance Frameworks

83.       In 33 countries, a new UNDAF (or another development cooperation framework) was signed
during the reporting period. In 25 of these countries, migration, human mobility or displacement were
included in both the narrative and the results matrix of the UNDAF.

United Nations cooperation

84.       In 2018, IOM became an official member of UN-Water, with which the Organization
collaborated on policy discussions as well as in crisis response activities during the year. Under the
institutional Environmental Sustainability Programme, discussions were initiated for potential
IOM membership of UN-Energy.
-----------------------Page 21 End-----------------------

C/110/4
Page 14


85.       One hundred and thirty IOM offices reported having closely collaborated with other
United Nations agencies during the reporting period. For example, in Algeria, IOM worked in close
partnership with UNHCR to organize the travel of refugees and provide them with services, such as
cultural orientation training, medical assessments, fit-for-travel assessments and pre-embarkation
assistance. In Burkina Faso, IOM and FAO worked together to support activities related to farming and
breeding in the context of reintegration. The IOM Office in Denmark cooperated with other agencies,
such as UNHCR, WHO and UNICEF, under the UN City initiative to provide recognized refugees with
training placements with United Nations agencies in UN City in Copenhagen.

86.        Regarding cooperation on SDG-related work, the Organization’s participation in various
thematic groups enabled it to achieve greater visibility for migration aspects in El Salvador. In Jamaica,
the IOM office actively participated in the United Nations Communications Group SDG Roadshow
initiative to inform the broader public of the importance and relevance of the SDGs. In addition, in
Indonesia, multiple agencies advocated for migrant children’s access to formal education, which
resulted in more migrant children entering schools in 2018. Lastly, in Guinea-Bissau, IOM provided
assistance for improving the integration of migration into the national development agenda and results
related to child protection and human rights.

87.      In 52 countries, IOM offices reported having an inter-agency working group on migration.
The Organization also chaired outcome groups or other inter-agency coordination mechanisms on
migration issues.

88.      Forty-three offices reported having in place a United Nations business operations strategy in
2018. Also, in 77 offices, IOM was contributing to shared services, such as joint IT systems,
communication costs, United Nations clinics and office space.

89.        The Organization contributed to the United Nations system-wide assessment of policies on
inclusion and the rights of persons with disabilities by completing the questionnaire on this topic.
Similarly, IOM contributed to the work of the High-level Committee on Programmes on equality and
non-discrimination by submitting a short progress report on its implementation of the United Nations
System Shared Framework for Action on Leaving No One Behind: Equality and Non-Discrimination at
the Heart of Sustainable Development.

90.       Furthermore, IOM contributed formally for the first time to the quadrennial comprehensive
policy review, the mechanism through which the General Assembly assesses the effectiveness,
efficiency, coherence and impact of United Nations operational activities for development and
establishes system-wide policy orientations for the development cooperation and country-level
modalities of the United Nations system. The Organization also participated in and contributed to
discussions of the various inter-agency coordinating mechanisms, committees and working groups,
including the Chief Executives Board, the High-level Committee on Management, the High-level
Committee on Programmes, the Human Resources Network, the Finance and Budget Network, the
UNSDG, strategic results groups and the Joint Steering Committee to Advance Humanitarian and
Development Collaboration.

National and local governments

91.       The Organization continued to work with a broad spectrum of ministries and entities dealing
with issues ranging from home affairs, border management and immigration, to health, gender
inclusion and national defence. In most cases, IOM advised governments on reviewing or developing
legislation and policies through consultations organized with relevant stakeholders, technical
cooperation or compliance assessments.

                                                                                                C/110/4
                                                                                                Page 15


92.       In addition to horizontal policy coherence between migration-specific and other
development and sectoral policies, in 131 countries IOM contributed to vertical coherence through
collaboration with local and regional authorities to enhance migration governance for development
and humanitarian response. This was done through capacity development and the provision of
technical assistance or support to mainstream migration into local policy planning for inclusive service
provision. Support also covered areas such as social cohesion, irregular migration, public information
campaigns on the rights of migrants and refugees, and resettlement operations. For example, in
Cabo Verde, migration was mainstreamed into local development plans through training and technical
assistance and the establishment of a local development platform that addresses migration issues.
IOM also supported 12 regions in Albania with awareness-raising campaigns on the risks of irregular
migration and regular migration opportunities. In Algeria, IOM worked directly with the Mayor of
Tamanrasset to roll out training on the prevention of HIV/AIDS and safe migration. In Georgia,
IOM carried out a week-long training session for 26 representatives from national and local
governments and the staff of four migrant resource centres.

93.       In addition, 42 offices reported that their host government had developed a plan of action to
support the delivery of strategies or policies, and 27 reported that the plan of action was being
implemented across decentralized branches of government at the local level. IOM also supports the
participation of local and regional authorities in the joint ILO–IOM training course on migration
governance at the local level which was launched in 2017 and is run annually.

94.       In Central America and the Caribbean, e-Campus, an IOM online learning platform offered
over 20 training courses in English, French and Spanish on topics such as migration management, the
protection of migrants in situations of vulnerability and labour migration to government officials, civil
society, students and academics. These courses are provided free of charge.

95.       Lastly, IOM is a supporting partner of the Mayoral Forum on Human Mobility, Migration and
Development, an annual city-led dialogue which provides a space where local leaders can share
practical and inventive solutions for governing migration. In 2018, IOM and its partners linked up the
Fifth Mayoral Forum with the Eleventh Summit Meeting of the GFMD and the Intergovernmental
Conference to Adopt the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration, all of which took
place in Morocco.

Civil society

96.       The number and types of civil society actors working on migration have gradually expanded
over the years. IOM interfaces with civil society at country, regional and Headquarters level on a wide
range of migration issues and through various means – operational engagement, policy dialogue and
advocacy, capacity-building, media and research.

97.      Eighty-five per cent of IOM offices indicated that they had engaged with civil society in
various capacities throughout 2018. The institutional questionnaire data showed that IOM offices
worked with many more national civil society partners than international ones. In 2018, 217 new
formal cooperation agreements were signed with civil society.

98.      Most IOM offices indicated that engaging with civil society added value in project
development and implementation, outreach and access to communities, and better advocacy on
migration-related issues.

99.      For instance, civil society partners provided the IOM Office in Colombia with inputs on
education and vocational training strategies, which improved the Office’s programming in this area of
-----------------------Page 23 End-----------------------

Page 16


work. In Austria, dialogue with academia fostered innovative thinking and better-informed
programming. In Guinea, working with national civil society partners contributed to successful
community advocacy owing to their proximity to local leaders. In Iraq, following IOM workshops for
civil society on irregular migration, civil society played an important role in raising public awareness on
the dangers related to irregular migration through its technical expertise and knowledge of the
national context.

100.     In Mauritius, in addition to the direct positive impact on beneficiaries, civil society
engagement also increased the quality of delivery and sustainability of IOM projects, thereby raising
the Organization’s profile and visibility – paving the way for further collaboration.

101.      At Headquarters, modalities of civil society engagement also expanded. Besides its regular
consultations on migration governance and humanitarian issues, IOM supported the independent
convening of civil society representatives for regional and global consultations on the Global Compact
for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration. Regular information-sharing sessions for civil society are
arranged at Headquarters with virtual participation across the globe to enable inclusive dialogue.

102.     The annual IOM–NGO Humanitarian Consultations are dedicated to strengthening effective
and principled crisis response and provide a forum for open and action-oriented discussion between
IOM and humanitarian NGO partners. The 2018 IOM–NGO Humanitarian Consultation, co-organized
with the International Council of Voluntary Agencies, was held in September in Geneva. Under the
theme of internal displacement, deliberations explored the humanitarian and development nexus and
improving coordination with peacebuilding efforts, humanitarian protection and transitional justice.
The venue for these consultations alternates between Headquarters and the regions to make the event
more accessible for local and national partners.

103.      While the Organization’s interaction with civil society is generally positive, challenges remain.
For example, in Morocco, owing to the projectized nature of IOM, ensuring the provision of continuous
and quality services to migrants can present challenges. Similarly, in Croatia difficulties were reported
in ensuring long-term partnership agreements with civil society implementing partners. In Estonia and
Uzbekistan, competition for funding had an impact on whether and how civil society partners
cooperated with and viewed IOM.

104.      At the institutional level, the Organization assessed its engagement with civil society to
identify an approach to manage civil society partnerships more sustainably. It also contributed to the
Task Team on Multi-Stakeholder Engagement, established under the UNSDG Strategic Results Group
on Partnerships to develop common minimum standards for multi-stakeholder engagement in
UNDAF implementation, including civil society engagement.

Private sector and innovation

105.      IOM has increasingly partnered with the private sector, creating new opportunities and
highlighting the issue of migration. In 2018, Headquarters and 70 IOM field offices had been engaged
with private sector actors on a broad range of issues and received technological, financial and human
resources from them in both humanitarian and development contexts.

106.      The number of partnerships and collaborative engagements between IOM and private sector
organizations increased to 279 in 2018 (2017: 212). This increase represents an important milestone
in efforts to establish long-term relationships with companies, foundations, associations and
individuals that leverage each partner’s knowledge, expertise, skills and/or resources for the benefit
of migrants and society. Of the 279 partnerships and engagements, 143 aimed to amplify key migration
-----------------------Page 24 End-----------------------

                                                                                                  C/110/4
                                                                                                  Page 17


messages through advocacy and awareness raising; 53 mobilized financial and in-kind resources to
enhance IOM’s operational capacity, efficiency and effectiveness; and 82 implemented joint efforts to
address migration-related opportunities and challenges that require multi-stakeholder approaches.

107.      The outcomes of IOM’s engagement with the private sector have ranged from developing
innovative solutions to mobilize resources and expertise to addressing issues such as human trafficking
or access to health. For example, in Belarus, IOM created an online community for sharing information
about safe migration to raise awareness of trafficking and the related risks. In Somalia, dentists in
Somaliland are using a web portal from a Finnish telemedicine company to consult Finnish experts on
complex dental health cases. Clinics are also using a mobile app to support maternal and child health
care. In Romania, IOM partnered with a leading international payment systems company to support
migrants and refugees in building a better life, with financial education and the development of
tailor-made financial products being some of the main components of the partnership. In Poland, in
cooperation with local associations, IOM established a migration working group for businesses to
enhance cooperation and knowledge exchange on labour migration issues. In addition, the
engagement of the private sector in reducing risks and increasing transparency in labour supply chains
has grown significantly in South-East Asia. Globally, several multinational companies have participated
in IOM workshops, co-published guidelines with the Organization, undergone labour supply chain
mapping exercises, and trained their staff in labour exploitation and counter-trafficking.

108.     To ensure the integrity of its private sector partnerships, IOM vetted 31 private sector entities
through its due diligence process across 26 country offices and Headquarters.

109.      In October, the first private sector field visit was organized to observe IOM humanitarian
operations in Cox’s Bazar in Bangladesh. Sixteen representatives from 13 companies from a wide range
of industries (e.g. finance, IT, textiles, aviation and not-for-profit foundations) took part in the visit,
which enabled participants to witness first-hand IOM operations and to explore key opportunities in
the humanitarian and migration field. IOM is currently exploring partnerships with some of the
participating companies with the overall aim of ensuring safe and regular migration for Bangladeshi
migrants and the well-being of Rohingya refugees in Cox’s Bazar.

Partnerships with diaspora and transnational communities

110.     Diaspora and transnational communities are important agents of development change. To
maximize the transnational exchange of diaspora resources, IOM supports a comprehensive approach
centred on “3Es for action”, namely to engage, enable and empower diaspora. In 2018, the iDiaspora
platform continued to consolidate IOM and other partners’ experiences and practices related to
diaspora engagement. The platform has several hundred resources and good practices relating to
partnerships with diaspora.

111.      In terms of global diaspora engagement, IOM organized the first Annual Diaspora Forum with
the Council of Europe in May. The Forum brought together parliamentarians from Europe and the
Middle East and North African region, the private sector, government officials and diaspora
associations.

112.     The extent and nature of IOM’s national-level diaspora-related support continues to be
substantial and wide-ranging. In 2018, 63 IOM offices encouraged governments to engage with their
diasporas. For example, 22 offices worked on diaspora mapping, and another 22 helped governments
develop policies for diaspora engagement; 18 were involved in providing support to integrate
diaspora-related issues into existing policies and laws. The diaspora engagement policies differed
depending on government needs and diaspora interests. In Ireland, IOM hosted migrant information
-----------------------Page 25 End-----------------------

Page 18


days jointly with diaspora groups. In several countries, diaspora mapping, diaspora engagement and
the incorporation of diaspora issues in existing policies and laws went hand in hand, resulting in
tangible outcomes (e.g. establishment of diaspora associations or dedicated units within the
government).

113.       Specific schemes were also designed for governments based on their needs or requests
(e.g. the return of Afghan diaspora for knowledge transfer). In Croatia, a national workshop was held
with the Government to identify specific economic sectors and skills-based areas that Croatian
diaspora could contribute to and to identify how the Croatian diaspora could be reached.

114.     Thirty-six offices partnered directly with diaspora or transnational communities in 2018. The
collaboration primarily related to specific thematic issues and events, as well as the joint
implementation of projects. Primary partners in the diaspora communities tended to be professional
networks, issue-based organizations and home town associations, in that order.

115.     During 2018, 12 IOM offices engaged diaspora or transnational communities in relation to
humanitarian issues. In the context of large-scale movements across Latin America and the Caribbean,
IOM collaborated with a Panama-based diaspora professional association to provide services to
Venezuelan migrants in situations of vulnerability. The IOM Office in Washington supported the
Government of the United States of America in informing diaspora communities from Bangladesh,
Haiti and the Philippines on disaster response, preparedness and disaster risk reduction. In the
United Kingdom, IOM held workshops for engaging the Sierra Leonean diaspora as humanitarian actors
for emergencies relating to natural disaster.


OBJECTIVE 1: SOCIOECONOMIC WELL-BEING OF MIGRANTS AND SOCIETY

Safe and regular labour mobility

116.      At the global level, IOM is committed to providing policy assistance on labour and human
mobility facilitation, supporting governments in policy development and formulation. In 2018,
76 IOM offices conducted concrete actions related to this thematic work stream which resulted,
among other things, in the development and/or update of labour migration frameworks and practices.
As an example, IOM cooperated with the African Union Commission, the ILO and the Deutsche
Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) on the elaboration of a capacity development
plan for labour migration across the African continent. This initiative aims to enhance labour mobility
management through a holistic approach, addressing continental, regional and national needs within
the framework of the Joint Labour Migration Programme for Africa.

117.      In addition, 34 IOM offices provided specific technical assistance for employment and labour
migration policy development. IOM assisted the Government of Namibia with developing a labour
migration policy, which has also enhanced the capacities of government officials working in this policy
area. Also, in partnership with the ILO, IOM is finalizing an assessment tool and training for the
development and implementation of bilateral labour migration agreements as a framework for regular
labour mobility pathways. This tool was piloted in several migration corridors in Africa and will be
tested in other geographical contexts. The tool aims to support governments in assessing existing and
developing new international cooperation arrangements for safe, orderly and regular migration.

118.     In support of the implementation of the Global Compact on Safe, Orderly and Regular
Migration, IOM is elaborating strategic approaches to skills development, transfer and recognition.
These endeavours led to the launch of the Global Skills Partnership in 2018. This initiative, involving
-----------------------Page 26 End-----------------------

                                                                                              C/110/4
                                                                                              Page 19


IOM, the ILO and UNESCO, among others, will serve as an inter-agency tool to address the
development and recognition of migrants’ skills.

119.      The Organization continued to implement IRIS, its global, multi-stakeholder programme to
promote ethical recruitment. Over 40 IOM regional and country offices around the world engaged with
a wide cross-section of stakeholders to enhance migrant protections during the recruitment and
deployment stages of labour migration. These stakeholders include governments, civil society, the
labour movement, the private sector and recruitment agencies. Under IRIS, training and
capacity-building programmes are developed and implemented for recruitment agencies, employers,
global brands, governments, policymakers and regulators.

Promoting social, economic and cultural inclusion of migrants

120.       The Organization is committed to promoting the social, economic and cultural inclusion of
migrants by reinforcing a two-way integration process, which is essential for fostering diverse and
cohesive societies. By helping migrants to better integrate into new communities, by building the
capacity of communities and authorities to welcome new populations and by promoting a change in
public perception of migrants, IOM empowers migrants and societies to realize full inclusion and social
cohesion. In 2018, 127 offices were engaged in promoting integration and the social, economic and
cultural inclusion of migrants in host countries; 93 of these provided direct support to migrants.

121.     National authorities, civil society organizations and the private sector are key stakeholders
for migrant integration and social cohesion activities. In 2018, IOM built the capacity of national and
local authorities (in 78 countries), civil society organizations (56 countries) and the private sector
(22 countries) in integration matters.

122.      The Organization’s work to promote migrant inclusion in host communities took many
shapes. In 12 municipalities in European Union Member States, for example, IOM offices developed
the intercultural competencies of local authorities and service providers to deliver more suitable and
accessible social and administrative services for migrants, and promoted partnership approaches to
migrant integration at the local level among various public, private and non-profit stakeholders.

123.      IOM set up 94 new migrant resource centres and provided operational assistance for another
49 centres. In Turkey, for example, municipal centres established by IOM are still operating as
counselling and referral centres to facilitate social inclusion of migrants in their localities.

124.     IOM continued its work to improve the public perception of migrants, with 72 countries using
social media to share positive migration stories, and 52 countries having carried out information
campaigns. For example, in Serbia IOM implemented social cohesion activities with the migrant
population in 18 reception and asylum centres under the joint United Nations project entitled Open
Communities – Successful Communities. More than 90 days of interactive workshops which engaged
more than 3,000 migrants – as well as local populations – were organized in different locations
throughout the country.

Improving financial and economic well-being of migrants and members of their families

125.      Another important policy area for IOM is support for the financial and economic well-being
of migrants and members of their families. This is done, for example, through initiatives on financial
literacy and remittances. Given that remittances constitute a large part of household income, they
have development implications not only for migrant families, but also for host and home communities.
In 2018, 60 IOM offices carried out work aimed at improving the financial and economic well-being of
-----------------------Page 27 End-----------------------

C/110/4
Page 20


migrants and members of their families. Out of these offices, 28 were involved in conducting financial
literacy programmes, 27 in awareness-raising programmes; 27 in improving knowledge of the financial
gains arising from migration; and 24 in improving access to additional finance; 13 worked with financial
providers and other stakeholders for increased availability of gender-sensitive services and products
for migrant households.

    IOM activities to improve financial and economic well-being of migrants and their families




126.      Fourteen IOM country offices were involved in activities linked to reducing remittance
transfer costs. The most prominent activity was advocacy with government and other stakeholders on
the need to reduce remittance transfer costs in line with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable
Development. Other activities related to improving transparency in the remittance market and
enhancing competition among existing money transfer operators (e.g. in Djibouti). In Ghana, for
instance, IOM provided technical assistance under the ACP-EU Partnership Agreement to review
legislation and financial mechanisms and make concrete recommendations on harnessing remittances
for development and identifying financial products that could be developed to increase household
access to information and additional sources of finance.

127.      The Organization worked in partnership with government and other stakeholders to
advocate for a reduction in the transfer cost of remittances through the creation of innovative
schemes; improving market transparency and competition; and enhancing financial literacy and access
to financial services for migrants and their families. For example, the project in Burundi, implemented
by IOM, the Universal Postal Union and the Burundi National Post, led to the launch of a domestic and
international remittance platform and to financial literacy and financial inclusion gains.

Tackling human trafficking, migrant exploitation and abuse

128.      Counter-trafficking continues to be a core area of work for IOM, with 141 offices
implementing anti-trafficking programmes and projects in 2018. In partnership with governments, the
United Nations, international and non-governmental organizations, the private sector and
development partners, IOM’s anti-trafficking responses encompass all aspects of the United Nations
Global Plan of Action to Combat Trafficking in Persons.
-----------------------Page 28 End-----------------------

                                                                                                 C/110/4
                                                                                                 Page 21


129.      Seventy-three offices developed materials on prevention and the protection of victims of
trafficking and other migrants in situations of vulnerability, while 45,411 officials (2017: 31,300) were
trained on protection and anti-trafficking measures. In many countries, IOM training and technical
assistance helped to strengthen the identification, referral and protection of trafficked persons, or to
improve anti-trafficking legislation and its implementation. For example, IOM worked with the
Secretariat of Social Assistance of Foz do Igaçu, Brazil, to develop a protocol on assistance for migrants
in vulnerable situations, which established coordination and referral procedures between various
protection agencies. IOM also trained staff of these agencies on the new coordination and protection
procedures.

130.      IOM has broad expertise in providing trafficked persons and other migrants vulnerable to
violence, exploitation and abuse with direct assistance, such as safe accommodation, medical and
psychosocial support, legal aid, and assisted voluntary return and reintegration. In 2018, it provided
protection and assistance to 7,400 victims of trafficking, 462 of whom were assisted through the
IOM Global Assistance Fund.

131.      Increased work with the private sector to address human trafficking and exploitation in
business operations and supply chains was emphasized by the publication of the IOM Remediation
Guidelines for Victims of Exploitation in Extended Mineral Supply Chains. Aligned with the
United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, the Guidelines were developed, in
consultation with downstream companies, audit programmes, smelters and refiners, governments,
intergovernmental organizations and NGOs, to provide a six-step operational process that companies
can adopt when they identify victims of exploitation. IOM also continued to provide training and
advisory services to companies on ethical recruitment, including through IRIS and CREST.

132.      As with previous years, IOM increased focus on other migrants vulnerable to violence,
exploitation and abuse, and provided protection and assistance to over 100,000 migrants along key
migration routes, such as the Central Mediterranean route to Europe. It also developed the
IOM Handbook: Protection and Assistance for Migrants Vulnerable to Violence, Exploitation and Abuse.
The Handbook describes the IOM determinants of migrant vulnerability model, which provides a
method for assessing the risk and protective factors at individual, household, community and
structural levels that influence vulnerability or resilience to violence, exploitation and abuse within a
migration context.

133.     In Central America and Mexico, 27 information kiosks provided timely and targeted
information on services for migrants, risks of irregular migration and regular migration options.

134.      The issue of migrant children and the appropriate response to their care and protection
needs continued to gain prominence. Accordingly, IOM developed a programmatic approach that
responds to the needs of migrant children prior to migration (e.g. by identifying and addressing drivers
that push them and their families into unsafe migration), during migration (e.g. by advocating for and
directly providing protection and assistance services en route), in destination countries (e.g. by
providing family tracing, assessment and reunification services for separated and unaccompanied
children), and upon return (e.g. through family support to ensure the well-being and successful
reintegration of returning migrant children).

Migration and health

135.     IOM health services aim to meet the needs of States in managing health-related aspects of
migration by promoting evidence-based policies, sharing practices and providing a platform for
multisectoral and multi-country collaboration. In close collaboration with partners, including WHO,
-----------------------Page 29 End-----------------------

C/110/4
Page 22


UNHCR, UNAIDS and civil society organizations, and in response to World Health Assembly resolutions
on the health of migrants, IOM advocates for migrant-inclusive, people-centred health systems and
capacity-building for the health and relevant non-health sector workforce.

136.      The IOM vision of “healthy migrants in healthy communities” is centred on four key
approaches: promoting migrants’ right to health; maintaining good public health outcomes (for
individuals and communities); contributing to the positive health and development outcomes of
migration (in countries of origin, transit and destination); and reducing health inequities.

137.     The Organization’s action in migration health follows four pillars, based on resolution
WHA61.17, which are: monitor migrant health; enable conducive policy and legal frameworks on
migrant health; strengthen migrant-friendly health systems; and facilitate partnerships, networks and
multi-country frameworks on migrant health.

138.      One hundred and ten IOM offices reported that they had been actively engaged in migration
health-related activities during 2018. Out of these, 97 stated that the government made efforts to
ensure access to migrant-sensitive health services for all migrants without discrimination. Moreover,
40 offices mentioned that the host government included data on migrant health in national surveys
and statistics, and 29 indicated that data were analysed and/or used by the government and made
available to IOM. Furthermore, 35 offices reported that data were disaggregated by age and sex.

139.      During the year, 79 offices built the capacity of governments and partners in migration
health. Some of the tools were for mental health and psychosocial support, which included e-courses
to train health workers on best responses in a crisis. Another one was a guide for psychological care
for migrants in Costa Rica. In Algeria, capacity-building activities were provided to peer educators on
preventing HIV/AIDS and safe migration. Fifty-two offices reported that the target audience for training
were health professionals.

140.      In line with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, IOM, in close partnership with
WHO, advocated for migration-inclusive health policies to advance universal health coverage
(SDG target 3.8) and SDG implementation at various global and regional venues. The Organization also
participated in the United Nations General Assembly high-level meetings on the fight to end
tuberculosis, and on the prevention of non-communicable diseases. It also jointly organized with
WHO and the Government of Slovakia a side event on ending HIV, tuberculosis and viral hepatitis
through intersectoral collaboration in Europe and Central Asia.

141.      Upon the request of WHO Member States, IOM contributed and cooperated closely in the
drafting of the WHO Framework of Priorities and Guiding Principles to Promote the Health of Refugees
and Migrants, which is referred to in the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration. In
2018, IOM continued its close cooperation with WHO and participated and engaged in several
Member State and partner briefings held by WHO on a global action plan on promoting the health of
refugees and migrants, with a view to its submission to the World Health Assembly in 2019.

142.      Furthermore, IOM carried out an analysis of the health components of the Global Compact
and produced an information sheet providing an overview of the key health-related commitments and
actions. The information sheet also included examples of IOM support for Member States in project
implementation and capacity-building for migration health programmes.

143.     The Organization participated in and provided thematic expertise for the WHO Summer
School on Refugee and Migrant Health, held in Palermo, Italy. To strengthen participants’ knowledge
of the management of health systems and public health aspects of refugee and migrant health,
IOM gave presentations and facilitated workshops for participating students.

Migration, the environment and climate change

144.      IOM continued its work to address the migration and environment nexus, especially through
global policy processes. For example, the Organization provided technical and policy advice on this
topic to its Member States in the process leading to the adoption of the Global Compact for Safe,
Orderly and Regular Migration, which recognized the importance of slow-onset environmental
degradation, natural disasters and climate change as drivers of contemporary migration. Furthermore,
through active engagement in the UNFCCC Task Force on Displacement, IOM also contributed to the
development and subsequent endorsement of the Recommendations from the report of the Executive
Committee of the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage associated with Climate
Change Impacts on integrated approaches to averting, minimizing and addressing displacement
related to the adverse impacts of climate change (annex to decision 10/CP.24) at the Twenty-fourth
session of the Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC. Throughout 2018, IOM also contributed to the
workplan of the Platform on Disaster Displacement.

145.      With the establishment of Regional Thematic Specialists in this area of expertise in three
regional offices, IOM expanded its programme on migration, the environment and climate change to
new countries, with 53 offices reporting that they had engaged in related activities in 2018. The most
common types of engagement were research and data, capacity-building, awareness-raising and
communication, and contributions to policy development.

146.     Evidence on migration, the environment and climate change was developed in 25 countries,
and country offices developed studies for the first time in the Plurinational State of Bolivia, Sri Lanka
and Tunisia, which provided the basis for future programme development and policy engagement.

147.     The capacity-building provided by IOM ranged from a regional workshop in the Pacific, to
national workshops targeting national or provincial government officials in the Philippines and
Vanuatu, and community-based awareness-raising and education in schools to build climate resilience,
for example, in the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia and Palau. These initiatives
benefited over 600 people globally.

148.     This engagement by IOM offices has an impact. For example, in Tunisia a study was published
that provides data and an analytical framework to support the Tunisian authorities in implementing a
framework addressing the impacts of environmental changes on human mobility.

Reintegration

149.      Providing reintegration assistance to migrants returning to their country of origin is an
essential component of the Organization’s approach to return migration, under assisted voluntary
return and reintegration programmes managed by IOM and returns operated by other stakeholders.
In its integrated approach to reintegration, IOM promotes sustainable reintegration through a
multidimensional approach that takes into consideration the economic, social and psychosocial
aspects of reintegration; appropriate monitoring, evaluation and learning; and the need to strengthen
the capacity of local actors in countries of origin to support the reintegration process.

150.     IOM has been undertaking concrete actions to foster the design and implementation of
reintegration policies inspired by its integrated approach. For example, the European Union and
IOM have launched several joint programmes (referred to as the EU–IOM Actions), the
implementation of which is supported by a knowledge management hub, established in 2017. This hub
provides thematic expertise and supports cross-regional harmonization of information management
systems; monitoring and evaluation activities; the development of knowledge management tools; and
return and reintegration-related research. Throughout 2018, the knowledge management hub
-----------------------Page 31 End-----------------------

C/110/4
Page 24


continued to support the EU–IOM Actions by strengthening information-sharing and enhancing the
harmonization of approaches, processes and tools. More specifically, it led to the development of
comprehensive guidance on measuring the sustainability of reintegration.

151.     The knowledge management hub also disseminates lessons learned and good practices on
reintegration, including through workshops fostering the exchange of information and experience. In
November, the hub co-sponsored the Technical Workshop on Sustainable Reintegration of Migrants,
held in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, as part of the work of the joint African Union, European Union and
United Nations Taskforce on the Situation of Migrants in Libya.

152.      In 2018, IOM launched the Operationalizing an Integrated Approach to Reintegration
(ORION) project, funded by the United Kingdom Department for International Development. Through
this project, IOM developed a reintegration handbook and a related training curriculum aimed at
providing practical guidance on the design, implementation and monitoring of reintegration assistance
for IOM staff, policymakers and other reintegration practitioners globally. Initial pilot workshops to
prepare the handbook training curriculum took place in Guinea, Morocco and Senegal in November.

153.      In 2018, 128 IOM offices were involved in reintegration-related activities either prior to
return (65 offices) or in the country of origin (64 offices). Activities included reintegration counselling,
referrals to appropriate partners and the provision of cash grants. In countries of origin, 64 offices
provided returnees with individual in-kind assistance, 19 offered collective reintegration assistance to
returnees, and 11 provided community-based assistance.

154.       Thirty-eight IOM offices facilitated dialogue and/or capacity-building on reintegration
management at local, regional and international level. Activities focused on improving understanding
of reintegration needs, contributing to the establishment of referral mechanisms, assisting with
legislative reviews and working on the adoption of guidelines. For instance, in Burkina Faso,
IOM contributed to the establishment of a selection committee for the validation of returnees’
business plans. In Armenia, the Organization contributed to the work of the government-led inter-
agency forum and round-table discussions on return and reintegration.


OBJECTIVE 2: MOBILITY DIMENSION OF CRISES

155.      In 2018, crisis-related programming remained one of the busiest areas of intervention for the
Organization. Crisis-related programming reached over 30 million people in more than 100 countries.
During the year, IOM activated or maintained its internal Level 3 mechanism for six emergencies,
namely two system-wide emergencies (Syrian Arab Republic and Yemen) and four corporate
emergencies (Bangladesh, Iraq, Libya and Nigeria) following an internal appraisal of the scale,
complexity and urgency of the crises, the Organization’s response capacity and any reputational risks
involved. The Level 3 emergency in Iraq was deactivated in the first half of the year.

156.      The Organization’s comprehensive approach to operations before, during and after a crisis is
set out in MCOF. Thirty IOM offices reported that they had developed or updated a crisis response
strategy using MCOF in 2018.

157.      The development of guidance, training and tools was critical to bolster and maintain IOM’s
operational effectiveness across all its priority work areas. The Organization continued to develop
innovative, context-adaptable tools and guidance, cascading initiatives at the operational level,
enabling CCCM, shelter and DTM staff and partners to roll out and adjust tools in their operations, and
to strengthen their collaboration with country-level working groups addressing gender-based violence
and with specialized agencies. These efforts had an impact on cluster-level responses and are regarded
-----------------------Page 32 End-----------------------

                                                                                                C/110/4
                                                                                                Page 25


as being among the most dynamic initiatives in the humanitarian sector. In total, 20 countries
benefited from technical support to mainstream gender-based violence prevention and risk mitigation
in emergency operations – including through the deployment of rapid response advisers in
15 humanitarian crises. Furthermore, over 500 staff and partners were trained on gender-based
violence mainstreaming considerations.

158.      The IOM Emergency Manual continued to be the central repository for the latest guidance
and tools on emergency response. In 2018, the Manual was accessed by an average of 1,651 users per
month.

159.      The annual Emergency Response Induction Training, designed to build the Organization’s
capacity to effectively respond to crises, was held in Turkey in support of 28 IOM staff members and
standby partners. This training expands the pool of qualified IOM staff who can be deployed in
emergencies and has become an integral part of institutional capacity-building. It enabled
20 deployments to support emergency operations in 2018 alone. Training on resources management
in emergencies was also organized in Egypt for 15 Resource Management Officers from various
regions. The overarching goal of this training was to strengthen the managerial and technical capacity
of mid-level officers and prepare them to assume a higher level of responsibility, particularly in
emergency response settings.

160.      To achieve stronger organizational capacity and preparedness, IOM developed internal
guidance and established a template for standard operating procedures for cash-based interventions
which spans several fields. The Organization also developed and piloted training tools to support closer
collaboration between CCCM, mental health and psychosocial support teams. A foundational course
on humanitarian protection for all newly recruited IOM protection officers was also developed. At the
end of the year, IOM had 71 protection officers and protection focal points working side by side with
all other key response and recovery personnel. Furthermore, IOM developed and conducted pilot
training to enhance staff capacity to understand when, where and how to implement transition and
recovery programming in crisis and fragile contexts.

161.      IOM is increasingly recognized as a leading agency on mainstreaming initiatives to prevent
gender-based violence, and in September it launched its Institutional Framework for Addressing
Gender-based Violence in Crises. The Framework helps IOM safeguard the safety, dignity and
well-being of all crisis-affected persons, especially women and girls, and aims to ensure that their
equitable access to services is prioritized, integrated and coordinated across all its crisis operations.
The Framework defines IOM’s vision and scope through three institutional approaches: mitigating
risks, supporting survivors and addressing root causes. Following the launch, IOM initiated the process
to develop its implementation strategy to support the operationalization of the Framework.

Crisis preparedness

162.      The internal Emergency Preparedness Monitoring Report process continued to reinforce the
Organization’s capacity to anticipate and respond promptly to imminent hazards. Prepared biannually,
in line with the IASC Early Warning, Early Action and Readiness Report, the Report enables IOM to
more effectively contribute to inter-agency preparedness efforts.

163.     As part of preparedness activities, IOM trained governments and humanitarian partners on
CCCM, DTM, shelter, assisting migrants in crisis contexts, health, protection and gender-based violence
mainstreaming. CCCM capacity-building events were held at the national and subnational levels in
28 countries, benefiting camp managers, other on-site support staff and personnel with administrative
and policy tasks. IOM also continued to train national authorities in areas where it is the principal
CCCM coordination actor, for example in Bangladesh, Nigeria and South Sudan.
-----------------------Page 33 End-----------------------

C/110/4
Page 26


164.       IOM continued to support efforts at country and regional level to bolster both internal and
inter-agency preparedness for potential large-scale disasters and escalation of conflict situations that
could lead to large-scale displacement by providing contingency planning and preparedness
workshops. The Organization contributed to preparedness for natural disasters in seven countries
(e.g. Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Dominica and the Syrian Arab Republic) and for conflict escalation in
four countries (Azerbaijan, Libya, the Republic of Korea and Yemen). IOM engagement with civil
protection in CCCM contributed to the European Union Mass Shelter Capability project “toolbox”,
established in 2018. Based on consultations and workshops with civil protection experts from
32 different countries, the project developed standardized tools to be used by European Union
Member States in preparedness for large-scale natural disasters requiring a camp management
response. This project complemented CCCM training conducted in Slovenia for IOM and
European Union Civil Protection Mechanism staff from over 20 European countries. The training led to
a draft framework for deployments where civil protection and IOM would jointly respond to ensure
the initial management and coordination of camps or collective centres.

Crisis response

165.     To provide timely and effective responses, IOM deployed 24 rapid response officers from
Headquarters for surge support for CCCM, shelter, DTM, gender-based violence and emergency
operations to 22 locations, and 40 officers for capacity-building activities to 27 locations. Rapid
response officers were deployed within days for 90 per cent of the 20 new crises to which
IOM responded in support of the first phase of response. The IOM emergency operations roster
supports the rapid provision of short-term technical assistance to improve emergency response
operations. In 2018, efforts focused on upgrading the roster system to improve IOM’s overall capacity
to deploy surge support and start-up or scale-up operations.

166.      With respect to IOM’s key role in inter-agency coordination of humanitarian assistance, the
Organization was engaged in 61 clusters, sectoral coordination or working groups in 37 countries
affected by crisis, sometimes leading on multiple sectors (i.e. in Bangladesh, Colombia, South Sudan,
Sudan, Turkey and Yemen), and participated in 31 of the 35 inter-agency humanitarian appeals. It led
or co-led 16 CCCM coordination platforms; 25 shelter and NFI coordination mechanisms, of which
7 were merged CCCM and shelter platforms (e.g. in Yemen and Nigeria); and 26 inter-agency or other
types of coordination platforms.

167.      When the Organization coordinated CCCM sectors, it had dedicated staff for coordination
(71% of cases), for information management (65% of cases) and both areas (53% of cases). As the
Global CCCM Cluster co-lead, IOM initiated global discussions on mobile and area-based approaches,
the use of cash in camp and camp-like settings, camp management standards, women’s participation
and localization. The Organization also hosted the first global Roving Shelter Adviser on Housing, Land
and Property, who supported country-level shelter clusters and cluster-like mechanisms on related
housing, land and property issues. Furthermore, IOM acquired full membership of the Global WASH
Cluster in March 2018 and continued to lead the inter-agency Global Solar and Water Initiative, aimed
at promoting the use of solar energy for supplying water in emergency contexts. During 2018,
IOM collaborated with UN-Water, and was also part of the Cluster Working Group on Water and
Sanitation.

168.       The Organization’s CCCM activities, ranging from emergency responses and capacity-building
to disaster preparedness and contingency planning, took place in 35 countries. By the end of the year,
the Organization’s CCCM operations had reached over 2.7 million people in more than 920 camps and
camp-like settings in 21 countries. In October, IOM carried out global camp management training with
the newly revised training package for 26 participants from several IOM offices worldwide. At the same
time, it initiated the process to develop training for cluster coordinators with a two-day workshop that
-----------------------Page 34 End-----------------------

                                                                                               C/110/4
                                                                                               Page 27


brought together all CCCM cluster coordinators. The Organization is also leading the effort of the
CCCM Cluster to develop camp management standards, and carried out consultations at the Global
CCCM Cluster retreat. Furthermore, IOM is working with Norwegian Refugee Council to lead a working
group on the area-based approach under the Global CCCM Cluster.

169.      In 2018, IOM’s shelter and NFI operations reached over 4 million people across 44 countries,
including people reached by partners through an IOM-managed common pipeline. About 3 million of
these people were reached in contexts where a shelter/NFI cluster was formally activated, accounting
for 25 to 30 per cent of the overall number of people assisted within formally activated shelter/NFI
clusters globally. Over half of IOM’s shelter and NFI support reached populations affected by the South
Sudan crisis, the Iraq conflict and the Rohingya refugee crisis in Bangladesh. An additional 30 per cent
of the people reached were in Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Nigeria, Sudan and the Syrian Arab Republic.
Notably, IOM’s shelter and NFI responses in Afghanistan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo,
Ethiopia and Iraq and were significantly scaled up compared with 2017.

170.      While different modalities of assistance were used, more than half was delivered through
in-kind distribution of shelter-related and household items. Other relevant assistance modalities
included shelter repair and upgrade, cash-based interventions for shelter, labour support and shelter
training. Tents and shelter construction reached less than 10 per cent of the households assisted. In
14 of the 17 countries where IOM delivered shelter-related items – and post-distribution data were
available – over 80 per cent of beneficiaries reported that the assistance had contributed to achieving
improved shelter outcomes. Similarly, in 17 of the 20 countries where IOM distributed
household-related NFIs, over 80 per cent of beneficiaries reported that the assistance had been
appropriate.

171.      The Organization’s WASH programming assisted 5.6 million people in 23 countries, mainly in
Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Libya, Somalia, South Sudan and Yemen, which accounted for 83 per cent of
those assisted. As a result of IOM WASH interventions, approximately 2 million people received clean
water, over 500,000 people gained access to safe latrines, 1 million people benefited from other
sanitation-related activities, and safe hygiene was promoted for 2.7 million people.

172.      IOM continued to expand and systematize its use of cash-based interventions to empower
beneficiaries and strengthen the resilience of crisis-affected communities. To this end, IOM drafted a
cash-based interventions strategy, including a comprehensive workplan for the institutionalization of
the modality and guiding principles outlining how the Organization takes into account cross-cutting
issues when implementing cash-based interventions. In addition, IOM produced cash distribution
guidelines, with specific focus on mitigating the risks of gender-based violence, and organized a global
workshop for field staff aimed at reviewing and improving its financial and administrative systems in
relation to cash-based interventions. In crisis-response contexts, IOM undertook cash-based
interventions in 19 countries, reaching over 700,000 beneficiaries, a 75 per cent increase from 2017.
In terms of total beneficiaries, the largest programmes took place in Bangladesh, South Sudan, Turkey
and Yemen.

173.      In 2018, the DTM, which collects, analyses and disseminates data on population mobility,
was active in 71 countries, with the inception of new operations through 2018 in 17 countries, and
tracked the movement of over 25 million IDPs, 19 million IDP returnees and 3.6 million returnees from
abroad. During the year, 75 per cent of DTM operations integrated protection indicators, including on
gender-based violence and child protection, into data collection activities. The DTM provided data on
internal displacement for common humanitarian response planning for 2019 in 17 countries.

174.    IOM continued its collaboration with the Humanitarian Data Exchange, managed by the
United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, to increase interoperability and
-----------------------Page 35 End-----------------------

C/110/4
Page 28


availability of DTM data. Data for 83 per cent of countries with DTM operations were available on the
Humanitarian Data Exchange portal to inform cluster/sector partners. In 2018, IOM-related downloads
and page views on the portal grew fivefold.

175.      By adopting joint assessments through the DTM, IOM continued to work towards
strengthening its evidence base for transition and recovery operations and to aim towards achieving
collective outcomes for both humanitarian and development programming. In addition, two indicator
libraries were developed to determine the extent to which specific indicators relating to durable
solutions and peacebuilding could be collected through the DTM.

176.     Through 2018, the DTM further established large-flow monitoring networks across
West Africa, Central Africa and the Horn of Africa with over 180 flow monitoring points set up in the
continent, and others established across Europe and areas of Asia. A specific DTM training module was
developed to collect reliable baseline data on human trafficking and migrant exploitation, abuse and
vulnerability during crises, displacement and large-scale migration.

177.      Furthermore, 21 coordination workshops were facilitated in 2018, and three regional
DTM training sessions were conducted, which enabled the DTM to contribute to the design of
effective, data-driven responses.

178.       In line with its global commitment on the centrality of protection, IOM undertook protection
activities in the context of crisis response in 36 countries, primarily through support to relevant line
ministries and State authorities. Migrants, IDPs and members of crisis-affected communities received
direct protection assistance in 28 countries in areas such as mental health and psychosocial support;
prevention of and response to child abuse, neglect and exploitation (focusing on unaccompanied and
separated children); gender-based violence prevention, mitigation and response; and humanitarian
evacuations. IOM provided capacity-building on protection to various stakeholders in 36 countries and
had a coordination function in 26 countries.

179.     In 2018, internal IOM funding, including the Migration Emergency Funding Mechanism, was
used to quickly respond to humanitarian needs in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Ethiopia, Guatemala,
Indonesia, Mozambique and in countries in Latin America and the Caribbean experiencing large-scale
movements. Internal funding was released to address the needs created by new crises, enabling IOM
to respond in a timely and flexible manner while resources were mobilized.

Health

180.      IOM assists crisis-affected populations, governments and host communities in strengthening
and re-establishing primary health-care systems. As a formal partner of WHO, and as a member of the
Strategic Advisory Group of the Global Health Cluster and, more recently, the Global Outbreak Alert
and Response Network, IOM is increasingly a key player in responding to humanitarian and public
health emergencies and supporting health system recovery and resilience. In addition to being an
essential part of IOM’s humanitarian mandate, health support in emergencies is identified in MCOF as
one of the 15 sectors of assistance.

181.     In 2018, IOM provided health support in crisis contexts in 38 countries which included the
provision of direct health-care services, mental health-care and psychosocial support, and outbreak
preparedness and response through its health, border and mobility management framework. The
Organization provided over 2.8 million medical consultations, and 341,271 beneficiaries were
vaccinated. IOM programmes, which included sexual and reproductive health activities, grew by
10 per cent compared with the previous year, and over 220,400 antenatal care consultations were
-----------------------Page 36 End-----------------------

                                                                                                  C/110/4
                                                                                                  Page 29


provided at IOM health facilities. Additionally, more than 197,000 beneficiaries received mental
health-care and psychosocial support.

182.     The Organization continued to focus on building its internal capacity and that of its partners
and Member States in public health emergency preparedness and response. In 2018, it expanded its
programming aimed at preventing, detecting and responding to health risks in relation to migration
and human mobility, including disease outbreak response and preparedness (e.g. in Bangladesh,
Colombia, Ethiopia, Kenya, Madagascar, South Sudan and Yemen). In the Democratic Republic of the
Congo, IOM assisted the Government to respond to two outbreaks of the Ebola virus disease in two
provinces (e.g. by supporting the screening of travellers at official border crossings and in areas of high
population mobility).

183.     IOM also provided additional services through rapid response and mobile teams (e.g. in
Bangladesh, Iraq and South Sudan), critical emergency referral services to secondary and tertiary
health-care facilities (e.g. in Myanmar, Niger, Somalia and South Sudan) and health system
strengthening (e.g. in Bangladesh, Colombia and Somalia).

184.      Lastly, IOM provided emergency and community-based mental health and psychosocial
services to displaced and host populations (e.g. in Lebanon, Nigeria and South Sudan) and engaged in
capacity-building in mental health and psychosocial support for local professionals at various locations.

Tackling human trafficking

185.      In 2018, IOM continued to work with the humanitarian community to ensure that the risk of
trafficking was mitigated and addressed from the earliest stages of humanitarian responses,
maintaining its co-lead role in the Anti-Trafficking Task Team of the Global Protection Cluster and
developing technical tools and sensitizing protection actors in the field; publishing the Manual to
Address Human Trafficking in Humanitarian Settings: Strategies and Tools for IOM Staff; creating new
online content for the Emergency Manual; and training and deploying IOM counter-trafficking experts
to countries experiencing crisis.

186.       Through the DTM, IOM also collected data on vulnerability to human trafficking in
humanitarian crisis and displacement contexts. The collected data were analysed to inform the
Organization’s counter-trafficking activities and those of its partners in these settings. Work continued
to refine training packages, practices and procedures for trafficking-related data collection and analysis
in crisis contexts.

187.      IOM contributed to the revision process of the Minimum Standards for Child Protection in
Humanitarian Action, with the draft document considering counter-trafficking to be a cross-cutting
issue. This effort complements IOM participation in the Child Protection Working Group, which sets
the standards to address the issue in humanitarian action.

Implementation of the MICIC Guidelines

188.      As part of its efforts to implement the Guidelines to Protect Migrants in Countries
Experiencing Conflict or Natural Disaster (MICIC Guidelines), IOM continued to develop
capacity-building, awareness-raising and guidance tools for governments and non-governmental
stakeholders. It launched and disseminated the free online training course for local-level practitioners
on including migrants in emergency management at the local level and published 15 Guidelines in
Action: thematic briefs illustrating options for implementing key recommendations included in the
MICIC Guidelines. IOM also expanded the MICIC toolkit with guidance documents for designing
-----------------------Page 37 End-----------------------

C/110/4
Page 30


migrant-inclusive emergency response and engaging migrants in emergency management activities.
Along with existing training materials for emergency responders, consular staff and migrants
themselves, these documents provide a solid foundation for a wide range of capacity-building and
emergency management activities.

189.     Furthermore, the Organization continued to organize and deliver capacity-building events on
implementation of the MICIC Guidelines. Over 50 training sessions and consultative meetings were
held at national and regional level in over 30 locations, involving 1,190 individuals. Participants
included personnel of national emergency management institutions, consular services, international
organizations and private sector and civil society entities, and migrant representatives. Consultations
were organized under relevant regional processes, including the Puebla Process, the Colombo Process
and the Caribbean Migration Consultations.

Transition, recovery and stabilization

190.       IOM’s transition and recovery programming focuses on preventing and providing solutions
to displacement in crisis and fragile contexts through community stabilization, durable solutions,
peacebuilding and disaster risk reduction initiatives. Through these interventions, IOM assists
governments, communities and vulnerable populations in reducing needs, risks and vulnerabilities,
and addressing the medium- and longer-term mobility dimensions of crises in line with collective
efforts to ensure a strengthened humanitarian and development nexus and improve coordination with
peacebuilding efforts.

191.     In 2018, there were 280 active transition and recovery projects across 69 countries where
IOM country offices supported local government structures through capacity-building, community
dialogue and other activities involving government counterparts, local partners and NGOs.

192.     The Organization also advanced its approach to strengthening the humanitarian and
development nexus and improving coordination with peacebuilding efforts in 2018. This included the
appointment of an adviser on the humanitarian and development nexus; an internal
whole-of-organization workshop; and a scoping study of experiences in Colombia, Mali, Nigeria,
Somalia and Turkey. Through these initiatives, IOM explored how it could contribute to collective
outcomes and the “new way of working” and was able to draft recommendations relating to this area
of work.

193.       Through its Progressive Resolution of Displacement Situations Framework, IOM continued to
pursue innovative solutions to displacement situations and to enhance understanding of complex
mobility patterns. The Organization’s approach to durable solutions focuses on strengthening
resilience, by supporting the coping capacities of displacement-affected groups, including IDPs and
hosts; promoting self-reliance and local government leadership; and establishing legal and policy
foundations conducive to the resolution of displacement situations. Programming in this area reached
362,368 IDPs and refugees through local integration, reintegration or resettlement elsewhere. Almost
385,000 IDPs and refugees were provided livelihood support, which comprised training for vocational
skills, business development and life skills, and short- and long-term job opportunities.

194.     Additionally, IOM provided assistance to displaced persons in accessing complementary
pathways in 22 field offices which included family reunification in Belgium, Cyprus, Germany, Turkey,
Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe.

195.     The Organization’s community stabilization work continued to play a key role in addressing
the drivers of displacement and creating conditions conducive to making voluntary and informed
-----------------------Page 38 End-----------------------

                                                                                                    C/110/4
                                                                                                    Page 31


decisions to return. Its work also promoted community–government engagement and fostered
improved socioeconomic stability. In 2018, 114 community stabilization programmes continued in
39 countries. In many of the programmes, local communities were engaged in activities supporting
social cohesion and peacebuilding. Along with fostering local priority-setting, IOM projects improved
access to basic services and essential infrastructure for communities in 41 countries.

196.        The IOM peacebuilding portfolio is designed to prevent and resolve conflict, a principal driver
of displacement, and to support sustainable peace and reintegration. In 2018, IOM offices in
26 countries undertook activities designed to prevent and resolve conflict and support sustainable
peace. The Organization implemented 28 projects relating to disarmament, demobilization and
reintegration in five regions, covering nine countries. While IOM supports a range processes in this
field, its primary contribution is to assist reintegration. At the individual level, IOM activities benefited
almost 8,000 former combatants with reintegration support, which involved training and connecting
labour demand with skills (Colombia); life and professional skills training, adult literacy classes and
social cohesion activities (Central African Republic); and reintegration assistance (Somalia). IOM has
invested in adapting existing methods and tools to respond to new challenges of violent extremism
more appropriately and in contexts of unresolved conflict, including in the Lake Chad Basin and
Somalia.

197.     The Organization’s efforts to address conditions conducive to the spread of violent
extremism are grounded in its commitment to prevent, mitigate and respond to root causes and
drivers of forced displacement. Work in this area grew significantly in 2018, with 19 IOM offices
engaged in implementing programmes addressing drivers of vulnerability to recruitment by violent
extremist groups. To achieve these objectives, IOM used contextualized tools including
community-level livelihood support, community outreach and small grants.

198.      IOM continued to implement and monitor its Strategic Work Plan on Disaster Risk Reduction
and Resilience 2017–2020, in support of joint action to implement the United Nations Plan of Action
on Disaster Risk Reduction for Resilience: Towards a Risk-informed and Integrated Approach to
Sustainable Development and to advance the wider prevention agenda. Eighteen countries received
IOM support through 28 unique risk reduction projects. In Rwanda, IOM strengthened the ability of
communities to prevent and manage hazards, for example through planned relocations, infrastructure
upgrades and support to small-scale agriculture. To present an overview of the Organization’s
operational activities and inter-agency partnerships to support States’ efforts to implement the Sendai
Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015–2030, IOM produced a report, Taking Sendai Forward:
IOM Progress Report on Disaster Risk Reduction and Resilience 2018. The Report highlighted IOM’s
growing footprint in disaster risk reduction and resilience operations.

Land, property and reparations

199.     During 2018, IOM provided technical expertise, assistance and capacity-building on land,
property and reparations issues, working closely with government bodies and communities in
nine countries, including Colombia, Liberia, Nigeria, Sri Lanka and Turkey (in relation to the displaced
population from the Syrian Arab Republic). IOM was also active in Iraq to assist in providing IDPs and
returnees with information and mechanisms to resolve their housing, land and property disputes. After
having developed standard operating procedures and trained staff, in 2018 IOM established centres
to provide assistance on housing, land and property issues in six communities in two governorates.

200.       At the request of the United Nations Office of the Special Representative of the
Secretary-General on Sexual Violence in Conflict, IOM conducted a preliminary assessment of the
feasibility and modalities of developing and implementing reparations for the victims of
-----------------------Page 39 End-----------------------

Page 32


conflict-related sexual violence in Iraq. As a result, IOM entered into a partnership with the Office to
implement a joint project to support the Government of Iraq to develop and implement a
comprehensive reparations mechanism for survivors of such violence.

201.      In the context of its support to the Sri Lankan transitional justice process, IOM organized the
International Conference on Reparation in Colombo, in February 2018, with the participation of
speakers and experts from over 20 countries and attendance of over 100 government, civil society and
victim representatives. The Conference helped pave the way towards adoption of the Office for
Reparations Act by the Parliament of Sri Lanka in October.

202.      In Nepal, IOM continued to engage with the Government and United Nations actors on
transitional justice issues. In the Central African Republic, it supported the mission of the Trust Fund
for Victims of the International Criminal Court and held discussions on future collaboration. In
Bosnia and Herzegovina, IOM continued its partnership with UNDP, the United Nations Population
Fund and UN-Women towards the harmonization of local legislation and mechanisms to support
victims of conflict-related sexual violence. In Colombia, IOM continued its support to the
implementation of the reparations process under the Victims and Land Restitution Law. At the global
level, IOM worked closely with the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the human rights of internally
displaced persons.

Resettlement and movement management

203.      Supporting the movement of refugees and migrants to safety is a core function of the
Organization. The principal areas of programming in 2018 were refugee resettlement, voluntary
humanitarian return from Libya and relocation within Europe. Collectively, these efforts serve as an
effective international protection tool, while providing a durable solution for those in the most
vulnerable situations.

204.      In 2018, IOM supported 30 States in conducting resettlement, humanitarian admissions and
relocation for 94,992 refugees and other vulnerable persons, with significant operations out of
Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Iraq, Jordan, Kenya, Lebanon, Sudan, Turkey, Uganda, Ukraine and the
United Republic of Tanzania. The top three resettlement countries were the United States of America,
Canada and the United Kingdom. The Emerging Resettlement Countries Joint Support Mechanism,
jointly managed with UNHCR, helped establish or strengthen resettlement activities in South America.
Of the above-mentioned total, 2,165 persons in need of international protection were relocated to
14 different European countries, of which 1,411 persons departed from Italy, 330 from Greece,
271 from Malta, 103 from Spain and 50 from France.

205.       The Humanitarian Evacuation Cell evacuated 16,457 migrants in situations of vulnerability
(83% men, 17% women) by air from Libya to 35 countries of origin and enabled 3,278 to be evacuated
by air, sea or land from Yemen to 10 different destinations.

206.       Sixteen IOM offices reported that the government in their respective countries had
established or expanded resettlement programmes as a direct result of meetings with IOM. Moreover,
six offices reported that the government improved its resettlement programmes as a result of IOM-led
training or policy guidance.

207.     Lastly, the Organization remained actively engaged in policy discussions with UNHCR and
other actors on complementary pathways for the resettlement of refugees.

                                                                                                 Page 33


OBJECTIVE 3: SAFE, ORDERLY AND DIGNIFIED MIGRATION

Safe and regular migration and visa facilitation

208.     Facilitating access to regular migration pathways is a crucial element of IOM’s efforts to
promote safe, orderly and regular migration. The support provided to States in the field of visa policy
contributes to cost-effective, timely and well-administered visa and entry schemes. Sixty-eight
IOM offices reported having promoted and facilitated regular channels for migration and mobility
through this type of support in 2018.

209.       Of the reporting offices, 26 indicated that assistance for processing temporary and long-term
migration visas had been their main area of intervention, while 23 reported that they had assisted with
specific family reunification visa programmes, and 6 with humanitarian visas.

210.     IOM offices that provided processing assistance for temporary and long-term migration visas
had supported 315,774 beneficiaries. Regarding family reunification visa programmes,
74,756 beneficiaries had been supported with the visa process. Assistance had been given to
9,555 beneficiaries for humanitarian visas application processes.

                     Number of beneficiaries receiving IOM visa-related support




211.      Thirty-two offices had addressed the specific vulnerabilities of migrants in their projects. For
example, in the Gambia, IOM identified potential migrants with active tuberculosis and referred them
to the national tuberculosis programme.

212.       Gender dimensions are an important factor to consider when implementing programmes in
the field of facilitation of regular migration pathways. The IOM Office in Slovenia serves as an example
for taking gender-related vulnerabilities, such as gender-based violence, into account in its casework.

Border and identity management

213.      Effective border management is critical in ensuring the safety and dignity of migrants and the
security of countries; it can also facilitate trade, the mobility of border communities and overall
development. Seventy-eight IOM offices reported having worked on border management during 2018,
with border security being one of the main areas of engagement (reported by 50 offices), followed by
inter-agency cooperation and information-sharing (46 offices) and travel document inspection
(43 offices).
-----------------------Page 41 End-----------------------

C/110/4
Page 34


214.      IOM activities in these areas focus on building States’ capacity to meet border management
challenges, including through developing technical solutions, supporting infrastructure improvement,
advocacy, policy advice and the organization of regional and global conferences. For example,
IOM worked to improve infrastructure at the Jordanian border with the Syrian Arab Republic to help
build capacity on integrated and humanitarian border management. IOM work in this area included
training for border and other relevant immigration officials. Sixty-one offices reported having provided
training to various officials, for example on cross-border cooperation and travel document inspection.

215.      As an essential element of border management engagements, IOM seeks to address the
specific vulnerabilities of migrants and travellers crossing borders. Fifty-two offices reported being
committed to addressing these vulnerabilities. For example, MIDAS – IOM’s border management
information system, implemented in over 20 countries – allows border officers in Cambodia to verify
the identity of children and their accompanying adults by incorporating border pass checks. In Djibouti
and Mozambique, standard operating procedures were developed which included the specific
vulnerabilities of migrants to assist immigration officials in identifying and referring cases to specialized
institutions.

216.     Gender is crucial in shaping migration dynamics. Gender considerations are therefore a core
component of IOM work on border management. Forty-five offices reported engaging in
gender-related activities in their border management work. For example, the topic was broached in a
simulation exercise on cross-border crises in Niger which emphasized the need for female border,
police and customs officers at borders to ensure gender-sensitive responses can be provided.

217.     IOM work on linking gender and border management also focused on incorporating
discussions on gender in capacity-building activities addressing migrant protection, transnational
crime or managing irregular migration. Another focus was providing States with support to develop
migration governance policy that would better include an understanding of gender-related
vulnerabilities.

Health assessment and travel health assistance

218.     At the request of receiving country governments, IOM provides migrants with physical and
mental health evaluations to assist them with resettlement, international employment, obtainment of
temporary or permanent visas, and enrolment in migrant assistance programmes, such as voluntary
return programmes.

219.     Through its pre-departure health assessment activities, IOM ensures that migrants travelling
under the auspices of the Organization are fit to travel and receive travel health assistance, such as
medical escorts, when needed. Pre-departure health assessment activities aim to: detect medical
conditions of importance for public health and safety; detect other medical conditions that require
special arrangements for travel and/or continuous health care after arrival; transmit medical
information in a timely manner to the receiving party to enable the proper preparations for reception
and continuity of care or as part of visa processing requirements; and initiate treatment, including
pre-departure stabilization treatment, or provide other services (e.g. vaccinations).

220.      In 2018, IOM carried out more than 376,800 pre-departure health assessments in over
60 countries around the world for refugees in the resettlement pipeline and migrants applying for
various categories of visas. Up to 117,800 refugees and migrants in over 40 countries were vaccinated
against more than 15 vaccine-preventable diseases prior to their departure.
-----------------------Page 42 End-----------------------

                                                                                                C/110/4
                                                                                                Page 35


221.    In addition to the pre-embarkation fitness-to-travel checks provided as a standard part of
IOM health assessment programmes, over 50 IOM offices provided these checks for other
IOM beneficiaries, mainly for returnees, counter-trafficking beneficiaries and third-country nationals.

222.      IOM also provided post-arrival health assistance to more than 5,000 beneficiaries,
40 per cent of whom were women, in more than 50 countries. During the year, over 5,000 migrants
travelled with a medical escort.

        Pre-departure and post-arrival health assistance provided to migrants and refugees




Assisted voluntary return

223.      In 2018, approximately 63,500 migrants (24% female, 76% male, of which 18% were
children) were assisted to return from 128 host countries (destination or transit) to 169 countries of
origin. The majority were assisted to return from the European Economic Area and Switzerland (53%).
This represents a significant decrease in returns from Europe compared with 2017. For the first time,
the main region of origin was West and Central Africa. Compared with 2017, there was also an increase
in the share of migrants in situations of vulnerability who were assisted to return to their countries of
origin.

224.     Forty-three offices were involved in facilitating dialogue and/or capacity-building on return
management at the local, regional and international levels. For instance, in Switzerland,
IOM participated in the drafting of guidelines for referral of victims of trafficking between Switzerland
and Bulgaria (including for their return). There were also fruitful exchanges of good voluntary return
practices between Swiss and Italian return counsellors. Among the engagements with various
stakeholders, some took place with law enforcement officials, as in the United Kingdom, or with
donors, as in Senegal.

225.      In 2018, IOM contributed to the launch and implementation of several programmes funded
by the European Union addressing migrant protection, voluntary return and sustainable reintegration
in Africa and Asia. Among others, these included the EU–IOM Joint Initiative for Migrant Protection
and Reintegration, pilot action to support community-based sustainable reintegration and a
programme on improving the reintegration of returnees. The thematic support provided notably
contributed to the national adaptation of standard operating procedures for assisted voluntary return
-----------------------Page 43 End-----------------------

Page 36


and reintegration, to carrying out community mapping exercises, socioeconomic assessments and
labour market surveys, to the improvement of monitoring and evaluation frameworks, to the
development of information materials, and to the enhancement of data collection and reporting for
these programmes. A psychosocial support guide was also developed for reintegration counsellors.


ORGANIZATIONAL EFFECTIVENESS: 2018 KEY HIGHLIGHTS

226.      IOM activities continued to have a significant impact on migrants and societies. To sustain
effective results for years to come, the Organization needs to demonstrate high levels of internal
performance. For this purpose, an organizational effectiveness results framework was developed with
key targets on internal performance. The core elements of the results framework are based on IOM’s
ambition to demonstrate how it is principled, purposeful and prepared. The section below reports on
the key highlights achieved by the Organization in 2018.

IOM is principled

227.      IOM continues to be a principled, accountable and transparent organization which follows
humanitarian principles, seeks gender equality and adopts a rights-based approach. It develops and
applies appropriate policies to guide its internal and external operations and manages its human and
financial resources in line with these policies. The following sections highlight additional themes not
covered in the “Principle 1” section.

Gender Equality Policy 2015–2019

228.     The Organization continues to implement the IOM Gender Equality Policy 2015–2019 and to
make progress in this area. Notable achievements accomplished in 2018 included the finalization of a
mid-term evaluation of the Policy, the start of a peer review with the World Food Programme to assess
reporting procedures and results under the United Nations System-wide Action Plan on Gender
Equality and the Empowerment of Women, and improved implementation of the Action Plan’s
framework, with IOM now meeting or exceeding 9 of the 17 performance indicators. Furthermore,
approximately two thirds of the milestones of the Gender Equality Policy 2015–2019 implementation
plan were met in 2018.

229.      Another notable achievement was the launch of the IOM gender marker in late 2018. It
categorizes projects according to the degree to which gender considerations are taken into account in
project proposals and measures how much of the Organization’s budget is being allocated to these
projects. Rating projects in this way is considered likely to make a significant contribution to gender
equality.

230.      During the year, 1,766 staff and non-staff completed the mandatory “I Know Gender” online
course, making a total of 10,401 since 2014. Additionally, in-person training on the IOM gender marker
was provided to staff covered by four more IOM regional offices and at Headquarters, meaning that
staff have been trained in six of the nine regions since 2017.

231.     Progress was made with regard to gender parity within the Organization. In 2018, women
represented 47 per cent of the total IOM workforce. Furthermore, there was a 2 per cent increase
from 2017 in female representation at the P-5 and above levels, with women holding 37 per cent of
positions in 2018 (see Annex I for more details). IOM continues to encourage applications from
women, who are less represented at more senior levels. The Organization will continue to closely
monitor, analyse and report these statistics.

                                                                                              Page 37


                        Snapshot of gender balance within the Organization




Standards of conduct

232.     By the end of 2018, 97 per cent of staff worldwide had completed the mandatory online
ethics and conduct training. This module, launched in 2017, includes topics such as protection from
and response to sexual exploitation and abuse, fraud and corruption.

233.    Throughout 2018, 96 per cent of sexual exploitation and abuse allegations were
acknowledged and screening initiated within 48 hours of report submission.

234.     IOM continues to demonstrate high standards of ethics and conduct. For example, in
compliance with IOM policy, during 2018, 461 staff declared outside activities, conflicts or gifts to
prevent potential misconduct.

235.     On 28 December 2018, the Office of the Inspector General placed its Investigation Guidelines
on the IOM intranet for all IOM personnel to access.

Transparency and accountability

236.    Following the establishment in 2017 of the internal Transparency and Accountability Working
Group, and in order to further enhance its transparency and accountability, IOM began the
development of a comprehensive internal governance framework suited to the achievement of its
mandate, strategic vision, objectives and goals. The framework outlines the essential requirements for
a modern and fit-for-purpose internal governance system, including enhanced transparency and
accountability.

237.     IOM also increased transparency with the decision to make documents issued for the
Standing Committee on Programmes and Finance publicly available (except documents with
confidential content) on its website as from October 2018. Seventeen such documents were published
which previously would have been available only to Member States, including an update on risk
management and reports on: (a) implementation of the External Auditor’s recommendations; (b) the
work of the Office of the Inspector General; and (c) the activities of the Audit and Oversight Advisory
-----------------------Page 45 End-----------------------

Page 38


Committee. The Organization also provided interim guidance to managers on the types of
IOM information that can be shared with third parties, pending formalization of an organizational
information disclosure policy, which will form part of the implementation of the IOM internal
governance framework.

238.      Moreover, the Office of the Inspector General made 17 executive summaries of internal audit
reports for country office audits conducted in 2017 available to Member States via a dedicated web
page on the IOM website. This web page became publicly accessible in 2019. Procedures governing
the publication of internal audit information will be reviewed and enhanced as the public disclosure
process is further developed.

239.        As a member of IATI since March 2017, IOM began publishing its organizational and activity
data in the IATI registry in February 2018, meeting its obligations as an IATI member. The Organization
followed an incremental approach to IATI implementation. It set the target of achieving a “Fair” rating
in 2019 and a “Good” rating by the end of 2020, with the data sets released by IOM being expanded
as work continued. Upon completing the necessary initial policy and system changes and releasing the
first pilot portfolio, IOM continued to publish additional projects each quarter and ended the year with
close to 500 projects published with combined total budgets exceeding USD 2.12 billion, with
consistently increased ratings. IOM had planned to achieve a “Fair” rating on the Grand Bargain/IATI
dashboards by 2019; however, this was achieved by the end of 2018. As IOM continues the journey on
the road of IATI publishing, the aim is to continue to expand the portfolio of activities and the data sets
published.

Environmental sustainability

240.     In 2018, IOM drafted its first environmental policy, which principally aims to align
IOM actions with United Nations environmental standards and improve the environmental
sustainability, resource efficiency and quality of IOM outcomes.

241.     The Organization continued its engagement with three significant partnerships to facilitate
the deployment of environmentally sustainable practices: United Nations Environment Management
Group; Global Plan of Action for Sustainable Energy Solutions in Situations of Displacement; and
Coordination of Assessments for Environment in Humanitarian Action.

242.     As the Organization faces substantial environmental risks at project level, a tool to assess,
manage and monitor project-level environmental risks and impacts (environmental marker system) is
simultaneously under development. The launch of the marker system is contingent upon funding.

243.     IOM also continued to establish a scientific baseline for monitoring environmental
performance for greenhouse gas emissions at the facility level. Furthermore, environmental
inventories were continued in 2018 and undertaken in seven additional IOM regional offices.

Data protection

244.     The Organization continued to implement the IOM Data Protection Principles, using the
IOM Data Protection Manual as a tool to give concrete guidance on the Principles and how they should
be implemented. During 2018, 505 staff members in 12 countries were trained on data protection,
while three IOM offices completed detailed personal data mappings, which demonstrate the flows of
personal data and adherence to the IOM Data Protection Principles.

                                                                                                Page 39


IOM is purposeful

245.      IOM continued to demonstrate that it is a purposeful organization by ensuring that all its
efforts were coherent and made an impact. The Organization is driven by results. It develops and
implements whole-of-organization approaches that are supported by evidence and data. Global,
regional and country strategies flow logically and contribute to the achievement of complementary
results and objectives. IOM helps to set the international agenda on migration and supports States to
effectively govern migration through integrated approaches and advocacy for policy solutions and
migrant well-being.

Results-based management

246.      In 2018, further progress was made in mainstreaming a results-based approach at the
institutional level. Work on the development of new country and regional strategies greatly
accelerated with the development of strategy development guidelines and face-to-face or online
training to support colleagues in the creation of results-oriented strategies. Fifty-nine offices revised
existing or created new strategies based on the MiGOF results framework.

247.      Internal and external communication on IOM results was enhanced through webinars,
training and reports. Internal reporting and coordination was also strengthened through one central
reporting system, namely the institutional questionnaire (for which the participation rate reached
98 per cent in 2018), which provided the data for the preparation of the present report. Further
improvements are nevertheless needed to improve the quality of reporting, for systematic use of
results and evidence for decision-making, and to ensure a full transition to results-based management.

IOM engagement in GP20

248.      In 2018, IOM joined the international community in celebrating the 20th anniversary of the
Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement, referred to as GP20. As part of these celebrations,
IOM held various events and campaigns across the world. For example, a 360-degree virtual reality
exhibition, “Holding On,” was developed to raise awareness of the plight of IDPs in Colombia, Iraq,
Nigeria, the Philippines and Ukraine. The exhibition travelled to five European and African countries
and was also held on the margins of the World Economic Forum at Davos, Switzerland. The “Holding
On” website had more than 40,000 visits during its month-long launch. “Holding On” reached more
than 12.3 million users across IOM social media platforms and garnered more than 283,000 reactions
and comments. Up to 56 million Twitter users engaged with the campaign’s hashtag #HoldingOn.

249.      The IOM Regional Office in Cairo undertook a month-long campaign, #AwareRamadan, which
raised awareness on the impacts of internal displacement and reached almost 300,000 persons across
11 countries. The special edition of Forced Migration Review (Issue 59: Twenty Years of the Guiding
Principles on Internal Displacement) contained two articles produced by IOM, one on relocation in Asia
and the Pacific, the other on the current response in Ethiopia. Both articles were well received, with
the latter being the most viewed page and downloaded article in that issue.

250.      IOM also remained actively engaged in the multi-stakeholder Plan of Action for Advancing
Prevention, Protection and Solutions for Internally Displaced People (2018–2020) (GP20 Plan of
Action), an initiative initially spearheaded by the Special Rapporteur on the human rights of internally
displaced persons. In addition to its active contributions to the GP20 Steering Group and
Communications Working Group, IOM co-led the data and analysis work stream and contributed to
the three other work streams: participation of displaced persons, law and policy, and durable solutions.

External communications and public perception

•         Campaigns, branding and visibility

251.     In May, the Organization launched the IOM Brand Guidelines, which have helped to
standardize and enhance corporate identity in visual communications material produced worldwide
and are almost universally adhered to by IOM offices.

252.      In just three years, the Global Migration Film Festival has evolved into a wide-reaching and
thought-provoking event. By the time the two-week festival ended at a gala event in Cairo on
International Migrants Day 2018, 104 IOM country offices had self-funded over 500 screenings that
attracted more than 30,000 people.

•         Audio-visual materials

253.       Forty-one IOM offices produced audio-visual content in 16 thematic areas. These included
products targeting the public and donors and ranged from corporate explanatory videos on IOM
activities to photo and video stories that highlighted IOM activities in the field. Such initiatives are an
important element of efforts made by offices to raise awareness on migration issues.

254.     Regular webinars provided photography, video and media training for 450 information focal
points, Chiefs of Mission/Heads of Office and field staff from 73 offices during the past three years.
When possible, one-on-one training has also been offered to staff during visits to Headquarters.

•         Media engagement

255.     IOM coordinated over 100 live appearances on broadcast media of IOM Headquarters
personnel, with a particular focus on the most influential mainstream media voices. Of the
159 reporting offices, 65 indicated that they conducted continuous media training for staff and
consistent updates to local media, mostly in the form of press releases. Additionally, 29 offices
conducted training with external journalists, and almost two thirds of reporting offices noted an
improvement in the quality of reporting on migration in 2018 due to these efforts.

256.     The IOM Newsdesk – an email bulletin issued five times a week and containing a selection of
migration-related news stories – was comprehensively redesigned in late 2018. The Newsdesk also
continued to serve as the platform for the dissemination of IOM press releases.

257.     In addition, a weekly English-language internal newsletter, Talking IOM, was launched in
September. Analytics revealed that roughly one quarter of IOM staff are regularly engaged with the
product.

•         Social media

258.      The Organization continued to use social media to support its digital transformation. With
over 3.5 billion users, social media have now de facto taken over traditional media, particularly among
users between the ages of 13 and 39. With over 4,500 posts across all platforms, IOM reached over
106 million users in 2018, gathering almost 750,000 followers (up from 160,000 in 2016) and
dramatically amplifying the social media content being produced in dozens of offices worldwide.

                                                                                                  Page 41


•         Community engagement

259.      IOM community engagement activities supported 16 projects managed in West Africa,
East Africa, Asia, the Middle East and at Headquarters. The projects used IOM’s innovative Community
Response Map/App, launched in 2018 to help offices collect feedback from target audiences.

260.      Over 1,100 video testimonials were produced in coordination with relevant IOM country
offices. The videos amassed 1.2 million views on social media and reached over 2 million people online.

261.       The impact of media and communications engagement activities were profound. In Senegal
for example, where a rigorous impact evaluation was conducted for the “Migrants as Messengers”
campaign, preliminary results showed that the campaign increased risk perceptions by 15 per cent and
reduced intentions to migrate irregularly by 30 per cent. Compared with similar studies in different
fields (e.g. health, education, job creation), these are considerable effects.

Monitoring and evaluation

262.      In 2018, progress was made in strengthening the core evaluation and monitoring functions
of the Organization. Efforts focused on building capacity of IOM staff and developing key institutional
and corporate guidance, including for standard and quality control support. Furthermore, the Office
of the Inspector General published the IOM Evaluation Policy and issued a revision of the Monitoring
Policy.

263.     In 2018, 43 evaluations were published, 14 external and 29 internal (including 5 central
evaluations conducted by the Office of the Inspector General). This represents an important increase
compared with the 23 published in 2017.

264.      In keeping with its strategy to manage evaluation and monitoring functions, the Organization
endeavoured to increase organizational skills in these important areas. The first standardized
monitoring and evaluation e-learning course was launched in 2018, covering all aspects of monitoring
and evaluation, including reporting. Twenty-two participants from 19 locations (Headquarters, four
regional offices, 14 country offices) took part in this training. In the post-training evaluations,
74 per cent of participants stated that the knowledge and skills gained were relevant to their current
work, and 84 per cent were confident that they would apply the acquired skills within six months.
Training for facilitators was also provided for all monitoring and evaluation staff in the regional offices
to support roll-out in 2019.

265.      Furthermore, internal evaluator training was conducted in Bangkok and Nairobi with the
participation of 43 IOM staff; of these 14 have already conducted evaluations. The internal evaluators
trained were provided with coaching during their first evaluations.

266.     IOM also aims to standardize its institutional approach to monitoring and evaluation by
providing technical guidance and quality checking. The Office of the Inspector General, together with
the Regional Monitoring and Evaluation Officers, responds to all requests for evaluation and/or
monitoring support from offices around the world. Examples of this support include reviewing tools
and frameworks, conducting training, providing guidance for regional strategies, drafting terms of
reference for evaluations and supporting the hiring of staff with monitoring and/or evaluation
functions.
-----------------------Page 49 End-----------------------

Page 42


267.      Efforts were also made by IOM departments to equip staff and partners in the field with
corporate guidance, tools and training. A guidance note on monitoring and evaluation for voluntary
return and sustainable reintegration was developed, along with related indicators and tools. The aim
is to harmonize indicators and tools used to monitor voluntary return and sustainable reintegration,
and to foster evidence-based programming and comparative analysis.

268.     The IOM Development Fund carried out project performance reviews on a number of
selected projects to evaluate implementation effectiveness. Furthermore, all projects developed in
2018 included a mandatory ex-post evaluation, to be carried out 6 to 12 months after project
completion. Evaluation findings and recommendations are shared with the IOM country offices and
government counterparts and are used in the Fund’s strategic planning and future fund disbursement
decision-making.

269.     The Fund completed a review of all the evaluations carried out in 2018 on projects it had
financed. The review collated and analysed the key findings of the evaluations, formulated lessons
learned and provided recommendations for project developers, managers and technical specialists.
Three reviews of projects implemented were also conducted, covering two regions for the period
2013–2017 and a thematic one on country migration profiles supported between 2011 and 2014.

270.      At country and regional level, 165 offices responded to the monitoring and evaluation part
of the institutional questionnaire. Of these, 60 offices (36%) reported that they had used a framework
to monitor and/or evaluate their strategy implementation, while 56 (34%) had started or completed
formal internal or external evaluations of projects or other evaluative processes during the reporting
period.

271.       A total of 147 offices (89%) reported that they used evaluations or monitoring information
to help improve their projects or develop new interventions and new phases of interventions, and
64 offices (39%) provided more detailed examples of the use of monitoring and evaluation, including
as a tool to generate lessons learned.

IOM is prepared

272.      IOM takes proactive measures to ensure that it can fulfil its purpose and deliver on its
intended results. These measures include sound financial and human resources management policies
and practices; appropriate risk management strategies; knowledge management and a commitment
to apply lessons learned to enhance organizational effectiveness; commitment to expanding financial
resources, including through flexible funding arrangements; and expanding its membership and
partnerships.

Knowledge management

273.       The Organization continued to focus on knowledge management and to implement
initiatives already taken to share good practices and lessons learned, including tools developed to
promote knowledge-sharing; for example, the Private Sector Partnerships Compendium, which gives
staff members access to key information on all engagements with the private sector. Other examples
include various tools used to capture institutional experience in migration and health, such as the
Migration Health Research Portal and the migration and health section of the Migration Data Portal
(maintained by the IOM Global Migration Data Analysis Centre). Work also continued on building
capacities to support migration health data capture and analytics.
-----------------------Page 50 End-----------------------

                                                                                                C/110/4
                                                                                                Page 43


274.      In 2018, IOM developed training on health in emergencies. It also published 59 technical
publications; of these, 15 were in high-impact peer-reviewed scientific journals. IOM continued to
serve as secretariat to the Migration Health and Development Research Initiative, an innovative global
network of over 200 scholars aimed at promoting research evidence to inform migration health policy
and practice – especially in developing nations. In 2018, IOM and the Initiative conducted the first ever
bibliometric analysis of migration health literature to reshape the attention given by policymakers and
researchers to migration health knowledge gaps.

275.      Three knowledge and capacity-building events on migration, the environment and climate
change were held in 2018. The first was a regional capacity-building workshop for policymakers in the
Pacific, and the other two were national capacity-building workshops held in Ethiopia and the
Philippines and also targeting policymakers.

Risk management

276.     Sound risk management is vital to the preparedness of the Organization to tackle and
respond to increasing operational uncertainty and build organizational resilience. In 2018, the
Organization continued to roll out its risk management process and to integrate risk management in
key decision-making and business processes. A critical focus was on the integration of risk
management in the project development process. Significantly, 74 per cent of the 123 offices reporting
on risk management analysed and recorded projected risks at the project development stage for
careful monitoring and management during the implementation stages.

277.      Resources were dedicated to the development of an enhanced risk management information
system to strengthen the risk management process by streamlining the input and analysis of risk
information, so that the information can be channelled in a timely manner for effective action. This
will enhance the Organization’s ability to monitor progress, capture actions taken and systematically
capture lessons learned to manage risks and leverage opportunities more effectively.

Financial highlights

•        Funding

278.     The combined total revenue of the Organization, comprising assessed contributions,
voluntary contributions and other income, increased by 15 per cent compared with 2017 and reached
USD 1.87 billion in 2018. The assessed contributions from Member States continued to represent a
small proportion of IOM’s funding structure, accounting for less than 3 per cent of consolidated
revenue for 2018.

279.       A notable increase of 46 per cent in funding secured for operational activities for future
financial periods was reported at the end of 2018. Namely, the deferred revenue under the operational
programmes, which relates to contributions secured from donors in advance for activities to be
completed beyond 2018, increased by 46 per cent compared with 2017 and reached USD 1.4 billion as
at 31 December 2018 (2017: USD 929.8 million).

280.     IOM continued to liaise with Member States to enhance predictable multi-year unearmarked
contributions from donor governments to cover some of the Organization’s core needs and to
implement strategic/institutional initiatives. In 2018, the Organization received USD 30.1 million in
voluntary unearmarked contributions, which was double the 2017 contributions.
-----------------------Page 51 End-----------------------

C/110/4
Page 44


281.     The Organization also witnessed an increase in private sector contributions, from
USD 4.1 million in 2017 to USD 5.7 million in 2018.

282.     In 2018, the total expenses related to the core structure were 7.5 per cent of the consolidated
expenditures of the Organization (2017: 8.0%).

283.     IOM managed 3,441 financially active projects during the year (2017: 2,925), of which
2,584 remained active at 31 December 2018 (2017: 2,277).

•         No-cost extensions

284.       In 2018, 434 no-cost extension approval messages were registered (out of 1,927 active
operational projects). The three primary reasons for the extensions were: (a) to continue
implementation of project activities (e.g. additional time needed to successfully complete the project;
activities pending owing to programmatic delays; change in the schedule of project activities;
outstanding payments); (b) external factors (e.g. delays in signing the agreement with external
partners; government holidays or change in schedule of government counterparts; change in internal
processes and restructuring of government counterparts; delay in procurement or securing supplies
from service providers; security reasons; weather conditions); and (c) additional project activities or
beneficiaries (e.g. implementation of new activities to utilize remaining funds; additional output as
requested by external partners).

•         Donor outreach, tools and accountability

285.     A draft institutional resource mobilization strategy was developed in 2018 in an effort to
secure a balance between earmarked and unearmarked funding from donors and, where possible, to
secure those commitments on a multi-year basis.

286.      In March, IOM organized its annual donor field visit, focusing on the Central Mediterranean
migration route running through Niger and Libya which has seen hundreds of thousands of migrants
attempting to reach Libya and southern Europe. It was an opportunity for IOM’s donors to learn more
about the Organization’s interventions in these two countries, including the multi-layered partnerships
necessary for the successful implementation of IOM’s mandate, and the challenges migrants face on
their journey for a better life; and for IOM to better understand donor priorities and expectations.

Procurement and supply chain effectiveness

287.      In 2018, procurement spending exceeded USD 1.1 billion, a significant increase in line with
the growth of IOM’s programme project portfolio and scale. Key interventions were introduced to
strengthen the functional foundations to further improve procurement and supply chain effectiveness
and efficiency. Interventions included reviewing the existing procurement policies and supply chain
operating procedures and introducing an institutional warehouse management manual to enhance
safe and efficient warehousing operations, contributing to effective project delivery.

288.     The Organization enhanced its global stock management capacity and capability throughout
2018, by increasing the centrally managed stock of standard NFIs for rapid humanitarian response.
Additional mobile quality control equipment was set up to support field offices and five long-term
agreements for replenishment of global stocks were in place. Moreover, a global stock strategy with a
three-year plan was set out to improve supply chain responsiveness and cost management going
forward.
-----------------------Page 52 End-----------------------

                                                                                                C/110/4
                                                                                                Page 45


289.     Long-term agreements remained a key intervention to ensure efficient and compliant
procurement, contributing to value for money. Sixty-eight global long-term agreements were in place
by the end of the year, an increase of 38 per cent (2017: 49). Plans were under way to further increase
procurement through long-term agreements, for example by fostering collaborative procurement with
United Nations agencies and international organizations.

Privileges and immunities

290.     Privileges and immunities ensure that the Organization and its staff have operational
independence. In 2018, the Organization benefited from full privileges and immunities in 95 Member
States and partial privileges and immunities in 52 Member States, three observer States and three
places where it had activities. It had no privileges and immunities in 25 Member States, five observer
States and four places where it had activities.

Member States and observers

291.     In 2018, three new Member States joined the Organization, namely Grenada, the
Lao People’s Democratic Republic and Palau, bringing total membership to 172 Member States.
IOM observers were joined by the International Monetary Fund and International Emergency and
Development Aid in 2018, a United Nations specialized agency and an NGO, respectively.

Regional support for optimal delivery of services

292.     During 2018, the regional offices continued to provide tailored thematic inputs and policy
guidance support to country offices. Support was mainly provided in the areas of project development,
review and endorsement, monitoring and evaluation, and reporting; knowledge management;
resource mobilization; and policy advice. For example, the Regional Office in Dakar endorsed more
than 100 projects, and 83 projects were implemented in the region during the year.

293.      The regional offices also provided support for external capacity-building initiatives
(e.g. conferences, training, technical presentations) and for the review of key strategic documents,
both internal and external, such as IOM country strategies and national migration strategies.

294.      With regard to knowledge management initiatives, the Regional Office in San José developed
a knowledge management platform for quick access to all internal documents, such as protocols,
courses, presentations and diagnostics prepared under the various projects or activities carried out in
the region. The Regional Office in Nairobi established a regional data hub to harmonize and integrate
mixed migration data from multiple sources in field offices, resulting in the production of trend reports
on migration data. This helped to promote national and regional migration policy dialogue. Similarly,
the enhanced support and capacity-building initiatives undertaken by the Regional Office in Bangkok
included preparations towards establishing a regional data hub.

295.    In the field of project development, the support provided by the Regional Office in Brussels
goes beyond the region: the Office provides worldwide support on projects funded by the
European Union, including on visibility and funding trends.

296.      The regional offices also carried out capacity-building and mentoring activities through online
and in-person training. For example, the Cairo Regional Office dedicated approximately 70 per cent of
its resources to the mentoring of country office thematic focal points by its relevant thematic officers
and specialists. In the Nairobi Regional Office, 26 per cent of the staff capacity-building budget was
-----------------------Page 53 End-----------------------

C/110/4
Page 46


allocated to the regional mentoring programme which was complemented with staff training funding
from Headquarters. The Bangkok Regional Office established the Regional Project Support Unit to
consolidate support for the project development and implementation cycle and, together with
Headquarters, regional training was piloted (e.g. on MiGOF and the IOM gender marker).

297.      Through increased capacity-building activities, the Regional Office in Dakar continued to
support country offices to maximize the positive contribution of migration to development, including
through the formulation of diaspora engagement strategies. It also worked with partners, such as the
African Development Bank and the African Union, on promoting the productive potential of
remittances and reducing transfer costs. In addition to ongoing programmes, the Office strengthened
the relationship between the WHO Regional Office for Africa and IOM and provided technical support
to French-speaking African countries in preparedness for and management of epidemics.

298.      Regional offices also support understanding of the relevance of global institutional
frameworks (e.g. Global Compact on Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration and SDGs) to the work of
country offices. For example, the Regional Office in Brussels provides advice on European Union
financial and contract compliance, contract negotiations, and verification/audit support on a wide
range of administrative, human resources and financial aspects.

299.      Regional offices also provide media and communications support, including through
multimedia content and other visibility materials for country offices. For example, the Regional Office
in Brussels supported institutional messaging and coordinated press lines, notably through drafting
and publishing editorials and press briefing notes on projects and events in the region. The Regional
Office in Dakar designed a regional communications strategy and branding guidelines with templates
to be used by all offices in the region.

300.     Furthermore, regional offices organize workshops and national events in collaboration with
the country offices. In 2018, the Regional Office in Vienna organized the “Voices of Migration” concert
at the United Nations Office in Vienna to raise awareness of the contribution of migrants and improve
public perception of migrants and migration. On International Migrants Day, the Regional Office in
Nairobi supported eight offices in screening films on migration and engaged with university students
and out-of-school youth to highlight the rights of migrants.

301.      The Regional Office in Dakar established a regional strategy for 2019–2020 on migration, the
environment and climate change, prioritizing regional expertise, policy work at various levels of
governance, and advocacy and partnerships. The Office also developed a regional strategy on youth,
employment and migration to support governments addressing the challenges and opportunities
linked to the upsurge in youth population, high unemployment and migration.

302.     The regional offices increasingly support country offices in their dialogue and negotiations
with governments and donors. For example, through a regional migration health project, the Regional
Office in Brussels engaged in training for law enforcement officials, social workers and health
professionals. This enabled country offices to widen their relationships with government counterparts.

303.      Regional offices also provide policy-related outputs and documents, including policy papers
and background notes. For instance, the Regional Office in Bangkok carried out initiatives to strengthen
evidence-based formulation and implementation of humanitarian and development policy and
programming in Afghanistan, Bangladesh, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Iraq and Pakistan. The Regional
Office in Brussels produced analyses of European Union migration policy and its implementation.

                                                                                                 C/110/4
                                                                                                 Page 47


304.      The Regional Office in Bangkok supported cross-cutting and multi-country partnerships to
identify and respond to trafficking, the expansion of the CREST project in Asia into a second year, and
the successful development of multi-country tuberculosis projects targeting migrants. New initiatives
with 10 private sector companies were undertaken in 2018.

305.      The regional offices sometimes need to respond to emergencies specific to their regions. This
might require remote emergency support or in-country support. For example, in 2018, the Regional
Office in Buenos Aires provided support for large-scale movements in its region, and the Regional
Office in Bangkok continued to support emergency operations in Bangladesh.

306.      The Regional Office in Nairobi ensures that protection principles are addressed and
mainstreamed in its operational and strategic advice, for example in project reviews and proposals. It
also raises awareness of protection principles through short and extended staff visits to country offices.
In 2018, the Office participated in various workshops on the inclusion of disability in humanitarian
action and on accountability to affected populations. It also ensured that the IOM Institutional
Framework for Addressing Gender-based Violence in Crises was used to address gender-specific issues
and mitigate the risks of gender-based violence in operational and emergency activities in the region.

IOM Headquarters building

307.      Plans to build a new IOM Headquarters building were in the early stages following the
adoption of Council Resolution No. 1373 of 27 November 2018. The Resolution requested the
Director General to prepare and submit an interest-free mortgage application to the Government of
Switzerland to finance the construction of a new Headquarters building in a preliminary estimated
amount of CHF 68.1 million. The final cost of the project will be established following a detailed study
of the pre-requisites for the project. The Headquarters Building Steering Committee, chaired by the
Deputy Director General, was established to oversee the project and will provide regular progress
reports to Member States during the life of the project.

Human resources

•        Human resources management

308.      In 2018, the percentage of international staff and national staff was 14 per cent and
86 per cent, respectively. As with the previous year, only 3 per cent of staff were based at
Headquarters. Also, 74 per cent of people recruited for international graded positions were internal
candidates, namely IOM staff. During the year, 219 national staff members were promoted to the
international category.

309.     Out of the total 12,673 staff at year end, 502 (28%) of those employed at the international
professional category operated in hardship locations (i.e. categories D and E).

310.    The recruitment process took an average of 107 days to complete after a vacancy notice had
been published for fixed-term contracts, and an average of 82 days for short-term contracts.

•        Performance management

311.     Sound staff performance management is critical to overall IOM performance. When
managed effectively, performance management sustains staff commitment and motivation. The Staff
Evaluation System had a 77 per cent compliance rate in the 2018 performance cycle.
-----------------------Page 55 End-----------------------

C/110/4
Page 48


•         Staff welfare

312.       There was significant growth in staff welfare services through an increase in staff welfare
officers: one centrally funded regional post and two funded by offices, in Nigeria (three months) and
in South Sudan (ongoing). The services offered included counselling and management consultations,
training, response and coordinating support to address critical incidents, and visits to IOM offices.
These initiatives also led to the implementation of the IOM Mental Health Strategy in high-risk
environments. The Strategy was implemented with a focus on developing and disseminating
educational material on well-being and mental health for staff and managers. Furthermore, IOM
became a member of the team of specialists established to launch the United Nations Mental Health
Strategy.

•         Consistent conditions for staff

313.     The roll-out of the Unified Staff Rules for General Service staff and National Officers was
continued, with 70 per cent of countries being covered by the end of 2018.

314.    In addition, by the end of the year, the Organization had 34 national staff association
committees to represent the concerns and interests of staff, with more being planned for 2019.

•         Diversity and inclusion and staff representation

315.      IOM is committed to the principle of diversity among its workforce and to promoting an
inclusive workplace, which enables staff to increase their contribution to the Organization and their
capacity to serve beneficiaries and Member States effectively. IOM staff work in multicultural
environments, in which diversity and cultural sensitivity are not only needed but required. During the
year, the Organization actively contributed to consultations on the development of a United Nations
disability inclusion strategy, which will later inspire upcoming policies and initiatives in the
Organization.

316.      By December 2018, the number of IOM staff members had grown by over 750 per cent since
1995; however, the ratio of international to national staff remained constant at 1 to 9. The
Organization aims to maintain an equitable geographical and gender balance among its staff. As such,
its recruitment efforts target nationals of IOM Member States. At the global level, 73 per cent of
Member States were represented among international professional staff, the same figure as 2017. The
Organization had 53 per cent male and 47 per cent female staff.

317.      During 2018, there was an increase in the number of nationalities represented among the
global workforce. Throughout the year, 168 nationalities were represented, compared with
162 nationalities in 2017. This figure included 134 nationalities represented at the international
professional level and 87 nationalities at the P-4 level and above. Progress was made in geographical
diversity at the international level. Up to 78 per cent of staff were from countries in the global South
(countries that are not members of the OECD Development Assistance Committee (DAC) and
22 per cent staff from countries in the global North (OECD DAC member countries). Focusing on the
international Professional category, up to 50 per cent of the total workforce were from countries in
the global South. IOM is an equal-opportunity employer and seeks committed professionals with a
wide variety of skills and competencies. Annexes I to IV provide a breakdown of the staffing structure
by nationality, grade and sex.

                                                                                                C/110/4
                                                                                                Page 49


•        Workplace conflict prevention and resolution

318.       The Ombudsperson continued to provide independent, confidential and informal support to
assist staff in addressing work-related issues. Work also continued on a preventive strategy for conflict
management training, informal conflict resolution, and the reporting of systemic workplace issues.
Over 1,350 staff were trained to develop skills that help prevent workplace conflict, which is costly and
presents various risks for the Organization. The respectful workplace focal point network was also
expanded, with over 50 focal points in offices worldwide. In addition, a revision of the
IOM Ombudsperson Policy was issued, along with an accompanying charter that established the Office
of the Ombudsperson and defined, among other things, the duties and responsibilities of the
Ombudsperson. In 2018, the Ombudsperson received 93 per cent more IOM staff seeking assistance
(255 visitors, compared with 132 in 2017). Using a methodology obtained from governmental
counterparts, a conservative estimate determined that the Ombudsperson’s support saved IOM over
USD 2.9 million in avoided conflict-related costs.

•        Staff security

319.       The Staff Security Unit is the Organization’s focal point for staff security management, with
its staff at Headquarters and in Manila providing overall global security advice and high-level liaison
and operational support. IOM has 23 International Field Security Officers and six Regional Field Security
Officers based in Bangkok, Cairo, Dakar, Geneva, Nairobi and Panama City.

320.      In 2018, 511 IOM-specific security incidents were recorded. These incidents fell under the
following UNSMS threat categories: crime (242); civil unrest (124); armed conflict (60); terrorism (59);
and hazards (26). With regard to safety, 71 vehicular accidents were recorded, and another
15 incidents were recorded as socio-political and economic events that had a general impact on the
safety and security of IOM personnel, assets and operations. The number of recorded safety and
security incidents in 2018 increased by 22 per cent compared with 2017.

321.      As part of its strategic and technical security risk management measures and duty-of-care
responsibilities, IOM implemented SCAAN (Security Communications and Analysis Network), a staff
security system comprising a digital platform for security professionals and a mobile application
designed for all IOM personnel. SCAAN enables users to notify IOM security personnel if they are in
danger, to be notified of potential threats and to submit security clearance requests. This
IOM-pioneered technical innovation is a first in the UNSMS.

322.       In 2018, 2,359 IOM and UNSMS personnel were trained and certified by IOM in specialized
United Nations security training which is either mandatory or identified in the security risk
management process as relating to preventive and mitigating measures. This training also contributes
to building the confidence and preparedness of staff deployed to high-risk duty stations or emergency
settings. It included the United Nations Safe and Secure Approaches in Field Environments training,
which is mandatory in 31 countries, courses on individual first aid kits and on security awareness for
women, and training for security focal points.

Information technology

323.     During the year, IOM updated its key IT policies and standards. It also strengthened its
collaboration tools and mobility solutions with the deployment of Office 365 to 14,300 users
worldwide; the creation of 109 collaboration spaces for internal and external members; and the

establishment of 155 thematic groups in Yammer, an enterprise social network. Furthermore, over
1,000 daily users interacted through mobile devices and workstations on Skype for Business, a
cloud-based videoconferencing solution, and/or stored and shared files with the OneDrive for Business
application. A total of 470 staff were trained on Office 365, PRISM and electronic filing, and 1,500 staff
were trained on password security and phishing attack prevention.

324.      PRIMA for the IOM Development Fund served as a critical technological tool for the
Organization in 2018. The tool enables users to view information on all projects – including project
documentation and status updates – funded by the IOM Development Fund. Regional offices and the
Fund also use PRIMA to monitor the implementation of activities when preparing on-site evaluations.
PRIMA is very beneficial for reporting purposes and also reminds project managers of impending
deadlines. The project management system was active worldwide in 2018, which enabled IOM to
garner feedback and enhance “PRIMA for All”, the initiative to expand PRIMA to all IOM projects in the
future. In 2018, 121 countries had projects recorded in PRIMA for the IOM Development Fund.

325.      IOM began collaboration with a third-party service provider to prepare for an IOM intranet
redesign and upgrade. The preparations included an initial survey questionnaire that was released to
a selected group of stakeholders and will be broadened by an enterprise-wide survey.

326.       The Organization was active in the development of mobile applications, including a
significant revamp of MigApp, its first mobile application. MigApp, which won a CIO 100 award for
innovation in 2018, helps migrants make informed decisions throughout the migration process and
aims to counteract the large volume of misinformation on migration in circulation today. It is available
in eight languages (Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Italian, Portuguese, Russian and Spanish). At the
close of 2018, MigApp had registered 17,451 downloads and reached a total of 92,500 followers on
social media. In 2018, IOM also globally released MiMOSA Mobile, a particularly useful tool for migrant
protection and assistance caseworkers owing to its mobile registration functions and offline capability.

327.     As part of improved operational efficiency, the Global User Support Unit reduced its response
time by 80 per cent with the implementation of “follow the sun” support, with around the clock
assistance on issues relating to information and communications technology being provided by staff
in Geneva, Manila or Panama. Under its enhanced IT security posture, the Organization deployed
automatic security updates to 13,000 workstations worldwide, and 98 million cyberthreats (viruses,
spyware, malware) were blocked by security solutions that had been implemented to protect users
worldwide.
