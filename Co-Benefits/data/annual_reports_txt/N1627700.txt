Introduction
1.
Mindful of its primary responsibility for the
maintenance of international peace and security, the
Security Council continued to engage on a wide reaching agenda in accordance with the principles and
objectives set forth in the Charter of the United
Nations. During the period under review, the Council
held 356 formal meetings, of which 331 were public.
The Council adopted 102 resolutions and 31 presidential
statements and issued 150 statements to the press.
During the reporting period, the Council conducted
five missions.
2.
The present report incorporates the changes
mandated in the note by the President dated
10 December 2015 (S/2015/944), whereby all future
reports will cover the calendar year, 1 January to
31 December. As this is the first report under the new
system, it bridges the old and new time periods,
covering the period from 1 August 2015 to
31 December 2016.
3.
During the reporting period, the situation in the
Middle East figured prominently on the Council’s
agenda. Meetings were held on the situations in the
Syrian Arab Republic, Iraq and Yemen, the Palestinian
question, the United Nations Disengagement Observer
Force and Lebanon. The Council also regularly
monitored the situation in Afghanistan.
4.
The situations in Africa remained a focus of the
Council. Frequent meetings were held on Burundi,
South Sudan and Libya.
5.
The Council periodically considered the situation
in and around Ukraine and continued to monitor the
United Nations Interim Administration Mission in
Kosovo and Bosnia and Herzegovina.
6.
Thematic, general and cross-cutting issues
remained a priority for the Council, including
non-proliferation, threats to international peace and
security caused by terrorist acts, the protection of
civilians in armed conflict, children and armed
conflict, women and peace and security, peacekeeping
and post-conflict peacebuilding, security sector reform,
sanctions, cooperation between the United Nations and
regional and subregional organizations, peace and
security in Africa, and the rule of law.
7.
The Council considered the work of the
International Tribunals for the Former Yugoslavia and
Rwanda and continued to monitor situations that it had
referred to the International Criminal Court concerning
the situation in Darfur and Libya.

Africa
Visits of the Security Council to Africa
9.
The Council undertook five missions to Africa in
the reporting period.
10. During the first mission, the Council visited
Burundi and Ethiopia from 21 to 23 January. In
Burundi, the Council heard contrasting views from the
President, Pierre Nkurunziza, on the one hand, and the
opposition and civil society, on the other hand, about
the situation in the country. The Council urged
inclusive national dialogue, an end to violence and
continued adherence to the Arusha Peace and
Reconciliation Agreement for Burundi. While in Addis
Ababa, the Council held an informal dialogue with the
Peace and Security Council of the African Union on
the situations in Burundi and in Somalia. This was the
first such informal dialogue conducted between the two
Councils. The Council also met with the Special
Representative of the Secretary-General and Head of
the United Nations Office to the African Union.
11. The Council visited West Africa, with stops in
Mali, Guinea-Bissau and Senegal during the second
mission, from 3 to 9 March. In Mali, the Council
focused on three issues: the acceleration of the
implementation of the peace agreement; the ongoing
threat of terrorism and the fulfilment by the United
Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization
Mission in Mali of its mandate; and the peace
dividends to the population. In Guinea-Bissau, the
Council stressed the importance of dialogue and the
mediation efforts of the Economic Community of West
African States. In Senegal, the Council discussed the
rise of terrorist threats and the need to continue to
provide adequate support to the region.

12. The third mission, from 17 to 22 May, visited the
Horn of Africa, where the Council continued to voice
support for the Somali political process. The Council
met with the President and the Deputy Prime Minister,
United Nations personnel, and other actors. The
Council also went to Cairo to speak to the Council of
the League of Arab States and to Kenya to speak to the
President of that country. On those occasions, the
African Union Mission in Somalia, the Middle East
peace process, Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant
(ISIL, also known as Da’esh) and Libya were topics of
discussion.
13. During the fourth mission, from 2 to 5 September,
the Council visited South Sudan, with a stop in Addis
Ababa for a meeting with the African Union and the
Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD).
Members met with the President, Salva Kiir, members
of the Cabinet, civil society, the Chair of the Joint
Monitoring and Evaluation Commission, the leadership
of the United Nations Mission in South Sudan,
contingent commanders and civilian staff. They also
visited protection of civilian sites in Juba and Wau. In
Addis Ababa, the Council discussed the situation in
South Sudan with the Chair of IGAD and the Peace
and Security Council of the African Union.
14. The fifth mission, from 11 to 14 November,
focused on the Democratic Republic of the Congo in
the context of the increasing political tension related to
the electoral process, and also included Angola. The
Council visited Kinshasa, Beni (eastern part of the
Democratic Republic of the Congo) and Luanda. The
members met the President, Joseph Kabila, and other
Government officials, political parties, civil society
and the leadership of the United Nations Organization
Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of
the Congo. In Luanda, they met representatives of the
Government of Angola, as the Chair of the
International Conference on the Great Lakes Region.
Burundi
15. In August 2015, in a statement to the press, the
Council condemned two high-level killings and noted
that there was no place for violence. In October 2015,
the Council issued a presidential statement
(S/PRST/2015/18) in which it condemned all human
rights violations and urged accountability.
16. Throughout the period, the Council was briefed
by, inter alia, the Special Representative of the
Secretary-General,
the
United
Nations
High
Commissioner for Human Rights, the Peacebuilding
Commission, the Special Adviser to the SecretaryGeneral on the Prevention of Genocide and
representatives of the African Union.
10/295

17. At briefings in November 2015 and March 2016,
the Council was informed that the situation in Burundi
was characterized by violence, inflammatory rhetoric
and extrajudicial killings. Council members were
concerned about the escalation of violence and civil
unrest, and some members were alarmed at the
possibility of a conflict relapse. The Council was
informed that hundreds of thousands of people had fled
Burundi for neighbouring countries.
18. In November 2015, the Council adopted
resolution 2248 (2015), in which, inter alia, it
requested the Secretary-General to present to it options
on the future presence of the United Nations in
Burundi.
19. In April 2016, by resolution 2279 (2016), the
Council requested the Secretary-General to present
options for the deployment of a United Nations police
contribution to monitor the security situation, promote
respect for human rights and advance the rule of law.
20. In July 2016, by resolution 2303 (2016), the
Council authorized a ceiling of 228 United Nations
individual police officers to be deployed in Burundi for
the purposes of monitoring the security situation and to
support the Office of the United Nations High
Commissioner for Human Rights. It was adopted by
11 votes in favour, with 4 abstentions. In October, the
Council issued a statement to the press, in which it
noted its concern about the continued lack of
implementation of the resolution.
Central African region
21. The Council received briefings on the Central
African region in December 2015 and in June and
December 2016 that highlighted the security and
humanitarian crisis caused by the Lord’s Resistance
Army (LRA), in particular its increasing number of
attacks in the Central African Republic, and by Boko
Haram.
22. In 2016, presidential elections were held in seven
countries in the region. In this context, the Council
underlined the importance of the early warning and
good offices of the United Nations Regional Office for
Central Africa (UNOCA).
23. The Council urged UNOCA to continue to
facilitate coordination among regional actors in
addressing a number of challenges in the region,
including piracy in the Gulf of Guinea, continued
aggravation by LRA, the threat of Boko Haram,
internal armed groups in the Central African Republic
and poaching.

Introduction

Central African Republic
24. During 2015, the Council supported the
transitional authorities of the Central African Republic
by mandating the United Nations Multidimensional
Integrated Stabilization Mission in the Central African
Republic (MINUSCA) to take a leading role in
international efforts to assist the transitional authorities
in achieving the successful and timely completion of
the political transition.
25. In face of the upsurge of violence in October
2015, the Council issued a presidential statement
(S/PRST/2015/17), in which it condemned such
violence and reiterated its support for the transitional
authorities. Noting the continuing security challenges,
the Council adopted resolution 2264 (2016) in
February 2016 to increase the number of corrections
officers. The Council issued statements to the press on
the upsurge of violence and to condemn attacks on
MINUSCA, in August, September, October and
November 2015 and in April and June 2016.
26. The Central African Republic held elections late
in 2015. A new government was formed following the
inauguration of the President in March 2016.
27. In April 2016, the mandate of MINUSCA was
extended until 31 July 2016 by resolution 2281 (2016),
and then until 15 November 2017 by resolution 2301
(2016). MINUSCA was instructed to adopt a robust
posture to support the creation of conditions conducive
to sustainably reducing the presence of, and the threat
posed by, armed groups.
28. In November 2016, the Council issued a
presidential statement (S/PRST/2016/17), in which it
welcomed the steps taken with regard to the Central
African Republic peace process with the signing of the
National Strategy on Disarmament, Demobilization,
Reintegration and Repatriation, the National Security
Policy, the Internal Security Forces Development Plan
and the National Reconciliation Strategy.
29. The Chair of the Committee established pursuant
to resolution 2127 (2013) concerning the Central
African Republic briefed the Council twice during the
reporting period. In January 2016, the sanctions regime
was renewed for 12 months by resolution 2262 (2016).
Côte d’Ivoire
30. The Council held briefings on Côte d’Ivoire in
January and April 2016. During those meetings,
briefers praised the peaceful election cycle, while also
underlining that national reconciliation and progress in
prosecuting alleged perpetrators of crimes committed
during the crisis were outpaced by reconstruction and
16-15226

economic recovery. The Department of Peacekeeping
Operations recommended that the United Nations
Operation in Côte d’Ivoire (UNOCI) begin the
withdrawal process. There had been tangible reforms
that allowed the Council to believe that Côte d’Ivoire
was ready.
31. Several resolutions were adopted. In January, the
Council decided in resolution 2260 (2016) to decrease
the authorized ceiling of the UNOCI military component
and requested the Secretary-General to provide a report
with recommendations no later than 31 March 2016.
32. By resolution 2284 (2016) of 28 April 2016, the
Council endorsed the Secretary-General’s withdrawal
plan, which was to be completed by 30 April 2017.
Until that time, the Mission’s mandate would be to
support the efforts of the Ivorian security forces to
protect civilians and efforts by the Government to
consolidate peace and stability in the country, while
helping to address border security challenges. The
closure of the Mission was to be completed by 30 June
2017.
33. On the same day, by resolution 2283 (2016), the
Council decided to terminate, with immediate effect,
all arms, travel and financial sanctions against Côte
d’Ivoire and to dissolve the Committee established
pursuant to resolution 1572 (2004) and the Group of
Experts established pursuant to resolution 1584 (2005).
Democratic Republic of the Congo
34. Political tensions surrounding the electoral
matters continued to be among the main subjects
stressed in briefings to the Council in October 2015
and in January, March, July, October and December
2016, as well as during the Council’s visit to the
Democratic Republic of the Congo in November 2016.
The Council was briefed that, without political
consensus on electoral process, there were significant
risks for violence and civil unrest. Through a statement
to the press issued in July 2016, the Council encouraged
all stakeholders to participate in the dialogue.
35. In the east, the security situation remained fragile
and the United Nations Organization Stabilization
Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo
(MONUSCO) continued to readjust itself to best
project force and enhance the protection of civilians. In
November 2015 and in August and December 2016, the
Council issued statements to the press on the security
situation in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic
of the Congo, in which it strongly condemned the
attacks perpetrated by armed groups against civilians
and peacekeepers and expressed its deep concern
regarding the persistence of violence in the region.

Report of the Security Council to the General Assembly
(covering the period from 1 August 2015 to 31 December 2016)

36. Two statements by the President were issued
(S/PRST/2015/20
in
November
2015
and
S/PRST/2016/18 in December 2016) concerning the
security situation in the eastern region and the political
impasse related to elections, respectively.
37. By resolution 2277 (2016), the Council extended
the mandate of MONUSCO until 31 March 2017.
While maintaining the current force ceiling, the
Council underlined that the Mission’s exit should be
gradual and progressive and tied to specific targets to
be jointly developed by the Government of the
Democratic Republic of the Congo and MONUSCO.
38. Concerning the violent clashes between protesters
and security forces that occurred in Kinshasa in
September 2016, leading to the death of many
civilians, the Council, in a statement to the press,
called upon all political parties and actors to refrain
from further violence and to engage in an inclusive and
peaceful political dialogue over the holding of
presidential elections. This was reiterated in a
presidential statement (S/PRST/2016/18) in December.
In the statement, the Council also expressed concern
about the humanitarian situation in the eastern part of
the country.
39. In June 2016, by resolution 2293 (2016), the
Council renewed until 1 July 2017 the measures
relating to an arms embargo, asset freeze and travel
ban affecting the Democratic Republic of the Congo
and extended the mandate of the Group of Experts. In
October 2016, the Chair of the Committee established
pursuant to resolution 1533 (2004) concerning the
Democratic Republic of the Congo gave a briefing on
his Committee’s work.
Peace and Security in West Africa
40. The Council issued a presidential statement
(S/PRST/2016/19) in December 2016, in which it
requested the authorities of the Gambia to respect the
results of the recent presidential election. President
Yahya Jammeh and the relevant Gambian authorities
were called upon to carry out a peaceful and orderly
transition process and transfer of power to Presidentelect Adama Barrow by 19 January 2017, in
accordance with the Constitution.
Great Lakes Region
41. The Council issued a presidential statement
(S/PRST/2016/2), in which it expressed regret that
progress in the implementation of the Peace, Security
and Cooperation Framework remained limited. The
Council urged more efforts to end the illegal
exploitation of natural resources by armed groups and
12/295

to ensure inclusive electoral processes. The Council
also stressed that the forced displacement of people in
the region was an underlying reason for conflict.
42. The Great Lakes region was also discussed in
November 2016. The Council was urged by briefers to
continue its involvement to maintain recent progress.
Guinea-Bissau
43. The Council focused on the political crisis in
Guinea-Bissau started in August 2015. The same
month, the Council issued a statement to the press
urging political progress and cooperation.
44. In a statement to the press issued in September
2015, the Council stressed the importance of the
appointment of a new government as soon as possible,
and in line with constitutional procedures.
45. The political crisis had a negative effect on the
development of basic services in Guinea-Bissau.
46. In February 2016, by resolution 2267 (2016), the
Council extended the mandate of the United Nations
Integrated Peacebuilding Office in Guinea-Bissau for
one year. The Council continued to express concern
about political problems in the country in statements to
the press issued in June, September and October 2016.
Liberia
47. During the period, the Council adopted several
resolutions on Liberia. In resolution 2237 (2015), it
renewed the arms embargo for nine months and
terminated the rest of the sanctions regime. The
sanctions regime was completely terminated in May
2016 by resolution 2288 (2016).
48. The mandate of the United Nations Mission in
Liberia (UNMIL) was extended until 30 September
2016 by resolution 2239 (2015), with the understanding
that a drawdown would continue and that Liberia
would assume full responsibility for security by
30 June 2016. In September 2016, by resolution 2308
(2016), the Council extended the Mission’s mandate
until 31 December 2016 and requested the SecretaryGeneral to conduct an assessment mission to Liberia to
provide recommendations by 15 November 2016.
49. Late in 2016, the Council was briefed that Liberia
was deemed stable, although greater investment in the
country’s security services and improvements in the
justice and corrections sectors were needed to maintain
stability.
50. The UNMIL mandate was renewed for a final
extension until 30 March 2018 by resolution 2333
(2016), which was adopted by 12 votes in favour, with
16-15226

-----------------------Page 12 End-----------------------

Introduction

3 abstentions. The Council reduced the Mission’s
remaining military personnel of 1,240 to a ceiling of
434 and its authorized police strength to 310 personnel.
Libya
51. Council members worried about polarization in
Libya and its negative effect on political progress. It
was stressed that Libya needed buy-in from all parties
for any progress to be made. They expressed concern
about the spillover effect of the situation in Libya into
neighbouring countries, in particular those in the Sahel
region. Throughout 2015 and 2016, briefers spoke of
the large task ahead, including the need for adequate
support from the international community.
52. In November 2015, the Council welcomed the
negotiation of a political agreement. Significant delays
remained, however, which continued to weaken the
country overall. The Libyan Political Agreement,
which provided for the formation of the Government of
National Accord, was signed on 17 December 2015.
Continued difficulties slowed the country’s ability to
address other issues, such as the presence of ISIL.
53. The Council welcomed the arrival of members of
the Presidency Council of the Government of National
Accord in Tripoli through a press release in March 2016.
54. By June 2016, the Council expressed frustration
with the fact that little progress had been made despite
the Political Agreement. In July, the Council welcomed
in a statement to the press the meeting of the Libyan
Political Dialogue and Presidency Council.
55. In September 2016, the Special Representative of
the Secretary-General and Head of the United Nations
Support Mission in Libya (UNSMIL) reported that
political divisions were deepening even further. The
list of the members of the Government of National
Accord had been rejected for the second time by the
House of Representatives. The Council continued to
urge political cooperation through statements to the
press issued in October and November 2015 and in
January, March, April, July and December 2016. The
need to face the challenges of Libya was also
addressed in a briefing in December 2016.
56. There continued to be great human suffering and
a need for humanitarian assistance. Meanwhile, Libya
remained a gateway for many migrants heading to
Europe. In 2016, more than 181,400 migrants had
reached Italy, while over 5,000 migrants had drowned
or gone missing. The Council released a statement to
the press on maritime migrant tragedies in April 2016,
when there were up to 500 deaths in a specific incident.

16-15226

57. There were three briefings by the Prosecutor of
the International Criminal Court, in November 2015
and in May and November 2016. The Prosecutor urged
the Libyan authorities to surrender Saif al-Islam
Qadhafi to the Court. The Prosecutor expressed
concern about the security situation in Libya. Some
Council members called upon the Libyan authorities to
hand over Mr. Qadhafi to the International Criminal
Court, while others underlined the importance of
investigating all the alleged crimes committed by all
parties to the armed conflict in Libya.
58. The Council adopted several resolutions. First, in
September 2015, in resolution 2238 (2015), the Council
extended the mandate of UNSMIL until 15 March 201 6
and called for an immediate ceasefire in the country
and constructive engagement in political dialogue. In
October 2015, by resolution 2240 (2015), the Council
authorized Member States to inspect vessels on the
high seas off the coast of Libya that they had
reasonable grounds to suspect were being used for
migrant smuggling or human trafficking, provided that
good faith efforts had been made to obtain the consent
of the vessels’ flag State. Late in December 2015, the
Council adopted resolution 2259 (2015), in which it
welcomed the signature of the Libyan Political
Agreement.
59. In March 2016, by resolution 2273 (2016), the
Council extended the UNSMIL mandate until 15 June.
Also in March, by resolution 2278 (2016), the Council
renewed until 31 July 2017 the measures imposed by
resolution 2146 (2014) on the prevention of illicit
crude oil exports from Libya, as well as the mandate of
the Panel of Experts. The mandate of UNSMIL was
again extended in June until 15 December 2016 by
resolution 2291 (2016), and until 15 September 2017
by resolution 2323 (2016).
60. In June 2016, in an effort to strengthen the arms
embargo imposed on Libya, the Council adopted
resolution 2292 (2016), by which it authorized for a
period of 12 months Member States, acting nationally
or through regional organizations, to inspect vessels on
the high seas off the coast of Libya believed to be in
violation of the embargo, provided that good faith
efforts had been made to obtain the consent of the
vessels’ flag State.
61. In July, the Council adopted resolution 2298
(2016) under Chapter VII of the Charter, whereby it
endorsed the decision of 20 July of the Executive
Council of the Organization for the Prohibition of
Chemical Weapons (OPCW) requesting the DirectorGeneral to assist Libya in developing a modified plan
of destruction of its chemical weapons, under which

13/295

-----------------------Page 13 End-----------------------

Report of the Security Council to the General Assembly
(covering the period from 1 August 2015 to 31 December 2016)

OPCW would help with the transport, storage and
destruction of those weapons. The Council encouraged
Member States to provide personnel, technical expertise,
information, equipment and financial and other
resources that would enable OPCW to implement the
elimination of Libya’s category 2 chemical weapons.
62. In October 2016, by resolution 2312 (2016), the
Council renewed for 12 months the authorization for
Member States to intercept vessels involved in human
trafficking and migrant smuggling.
63. The Council also heard briefings concerning
sanctions by the Chair of the Committee established
pursuant to resolution 1970 (2011), in December 2015
and in March, June, September and December 2016.
Mali
64. In October 2015, the Special Representative of
the Secretary-General and Head of the United Nations
Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in
Mali (MINUSMA) said that, while the Agreement on
Peace and Reconciliation in Mali of 2015 continued to
underlie political actions, its implementation had been
slow and the security situation in Mali continued to be
difficult. It was stressed that events on the ground
showed the need for urgent cantonment and security
sector reform.
65. The Under-Secretary-General for Peacekeeping
Operations warned in January 2016 that the situation
remained fragile and that the implementation of the
Agreement was slow. On the plus side, there was the
creation of the Truth, Justice and Reconciliation
Commission and continued international engagement.
In a statement to the press, the Council stressed again
the need for all parties to prioritize implementation of
the Agreement.
66. In April, the Under-Secretary-General for
Peacekeeping Operations noted as a positive
development the creation of national commissions on
disarmament, demobilization and reintegration, and the
construction of cantonment sites, while remaining
concerned about the slow progress of defence and
security reforms. In June, the Special Representative of
the Secretary-General recommended authorizing
proactive operations for what had become the deadliest
United Nations peacekeeping operation.
67. Following that briefing, the Council adopted
resolution 2295 (2016), by which it raised the force
levels and extended the mandate of the Mission until
30 June 2017. The Mission’s strategic priority would
be to support the implementation of the Agreement by
the parties to the conflict in Mali, its other tasks
including good offices and reconciliation, the
14/295

protection of civilians and the protection, safety and
security of United Nations personnel. Some members
of the Council, while voting for the resolution,
explained their view that it was not in the United
Nations purview to combat terrorism.
68. In October 2016, the Under-Secretary-General for
Peacekeeping Operations reported that the Agreement
continued to be unimplemented, and that MINUSMA
could not fully implement its mandate. In a presidential
statement (S/PRST/2016/16), the Council condemned
repeated ceasefire violations and urged the Government
and signatory armed groups to work together.
69. The presence of extremist groups in northern
Mali remained a concern. The Government of Mali
continued to combat extremist forces. There also
continued to be terrorist attacks, which the Council
condemned in statements to the press issued in
November 2015 and in February, May, June, August
and October 2016.
Somalia
70. The Council continued to monitor the democratic
process in Somalia and the fight against Al-Shabaab.
Al-Shabaab continued to perpetrate attacks, which the
Council condemned in statements to the press issued in
September and November 2015 and in January and
June 2016.
71. In statements to the press issued in April and May
2016, the Council expressed its view that Somalia had
come a long way towards achieving real progress. It
still faced challenges, however, when it came to the
rule of law and inclusive politics.
72. The humanitarian situation in Somalia remained a
considerable concern, with millions of people requiring
aid.
73. In resolution 2275 (2016), the Council extended
the mandate of the United Nations Assistance Mission
in Somalia (UNSOM) until 31 March 2017. The Council
underlined the importance of continued support for the
Somalia peace and reconciliation process and the
electoral process scheduled for later in 2016.
74. By resolution 2289 (2016), the Council authorized
a short extension of the mandate of the African Union
Mission in Somalia (AMISOM). In July 2016, by
resolution 2297 (2016), the Council renewed the
Mission’s mandate until 31 May 2017 and agreed that
the conditions in Somalia were not appropriate for the
deployment of a United Nations peacekeeping mission.
75. In August 2016, when the electoral process was
supposed to begin, the Council was presented with a
revised timetable, because of delays in Somalia. The
16-15226

-----------------------Page 14 End-----------------------

Introduction

electoral process was now to take place in October. In
a presidential statement issued on August 2016
(S/PRST/2016/13), the Council underscored the need
to maintain the momentum towards democratic
governance, with an inclusive, transparent and credible
electoral process in 2016 as a stepping stone to
universal suffrage elections in 2020. In September, it
was announced that the process would need to be
delayed until the end of November. In a statement to
the press issued on 28 September 2016, the Council
expressed regret at those delays, while expressing its
continued support for Somalia to overcome its political
differences.
76. The Council was briefed in October 2015 that, in
order to perform well, the United Nations Support
Office for the African Union Mission in Somalia
(UNSOA) needed to be strengthened. The briefer urged
critical financial support from the Council, the Ge neral
Assembly, Member States and the African Union, as
current resources had not kept pace with the increased
demands on UNSOA.
77. In response, the Council adopted resolution 2245
(2015), by which it decided that UNSOA would bear
the name United Nations Support Office in Somalia
(UNSOS) to better serve its client base (AMISOM,
UNSOM and the Somali National Army). Logistical
support to AMISOM, the Somali National Army on
joint operations with AMISOM, and UNSOM was to
continue.
78. The Council renewed the arms embargo on
Somalia and Eritrea by resolutions 2244 (2015) and
2317 (2016). In February 2016, the Chair of the
Committee pursuant to resolutions 751 (1992) and
1907 (2009) concerning Somalia and Eritrea gave a
briefing focusing on natural resources, saying that
more partner coordination was needed to stop the
illegal charcoal trade in Somalia.
79. The Council renewed measures to combat piracy
in resolutions 2246 (2015) and 2316 (2016), by which
it renewed for 12 months each time the measures to
counter piracy and armed robbery off coast of Somalia.
Sudan and South Sudan*
Darfur
80. In September 2015, the Council issued a
statement to the press in which it condemned an attack
on the African Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation
* For the purposes of the present report, developments
under this item are set out under three headings:
“Darfur”, “South Sudan” and “Sudan, South Sudan and
Abyei”.
16-15226

in Darfur (UNAMID) that had killed one peacekeeper
and injured four others.
81. In October 2015, the Council was briefed on
ongoing meetings on the national dialogue and the
cessation of hostilities, as well as the military
operation “Decisive Summer”. The latter made military
gains while, at the same time, displacing some of the
civilian population. UNAMID and the United Nations
country team continued to create a plan for the gradual
transfer of tasks, the initial phase of which would focus
on capacity-building.
82. Hostilities flared up in northern and western
Darfur in January 2016, including attacks on
UNAMID. The United Nations was unable to confirm
the number of displaced persons, owing to access
restrictions. The Council condemned an attack on
UNAMID peacekeepers in March 2016. By resolution
2265 (2016), in February 2016, the Council continued
the sanctions regime and extended the mandate of the
Panel of Experts until 12 March 2017.
83. By the beginning of April, the Government of the
Sudan had retaken the Jebel Marra area, except for
some pockets of resistance. The ability of UNAMID to
fulfil its mandate was still hampered by restrictions on
access and violations of the status-of-forces agreement.
84. In June 2016, by resolution 2296 (2016), the
Council extended the mandate of UNAMID until
30 June 2017. In August 2016, in a statement to the
press, the Council welcomed the signing of the road
map agreement by the Justice and Equality Movement,
the Sudan Liberation Movement/Minni Minnawi, the
Sudan People’s Liberation Movement-North and the
National Umma Party, as well as the support for the
road map agreement by other members of the Sudan
Call. The Council commended the Government of Sudan
for signing the road map agreement on 16 March 2016.
85. In a briefing in October 2016, the Council was
informed that the peace process remained constrained.
86. The United Nations continued to stress the need
for the Government of the Sudan to allow it unimpeded
access so that UNAMID might implement its mandate,
and to facilitate the delivery of its food rations from
Port Sudan. The United Nations also continued to face
hurdles in receiving approval of visas.
87. The Council was briefed in December 2015 and
in June and December 2016 by the Prosecutor of the
International Criminal Court, who expressed concern at
the lack of cooperation by the Government of the
Sudan and urged the Council to enforce the obligations
under resolution 1593 (2005). Some Council members
urged the Government of the Sudan to cooperate fully
15/295

Report of the Security Council to the General Assembly
(covering the period from 1 August 2015 to 31 December 2016)

with the International Criminal Court, while others
supported the African Union position, including on the
immunities of the officials of non-States parties to the
Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court.
South Sudan
88. South Sudan continued to grapple with internal
strife and division. In August 2015, the political
situation remained tense and the Council issued a
presidential statement (S/PRST/2015/16) to remind
parties that the Council was ready to consider
appropriate measures to ensure the implementation of
the Agreement on the Resolution of the Conflict in the
Republic of South Sudan, including the imposition of
an arms embargo and additional targeted sanctions.
89. In October 2015, the Council extended for two
months the mandate of the United Nations Mission in
South Sudan (UNMISS) by resolution 2241 (2015),
which was adopted by 13 votes in favour, with
2 abstentions. The Council urged full implementation
of the Agreement and expanded the Mission’s mandate
to help to support implementation of the Agreement. It
also requested the Secretary-General to make available
technical assistance for the implementation of chapter V
of the Agreement to the Commission of the African
Union and to the Transitional Government of National
Unity, and to report to the Council on that assistance
within six months.
90. In December 2015, the Council heard from the
Secretariat that international pressure and cooperation
were needed to ensure that the Agreement could be
implemented and hostilities could end.
91. After
hearing
the
Secretary-General’s
recommendations, the Council extended the mandate of
UNMISS until 31 July 2016 by resolution 2252 (2015),
which was adopted by 13 votes in favour, with
2 abstentions. The Council increased force levels while
maintaining the core elements of the Mission’s
mandate — the protection of civilians, monitoring and
investigating human rights violations, the creation of
conditions conducive to the delivery of humanitarian
assistance and the implementation of the Agreement.
The Council requested UNMISS to continue to
intensify its presence and active patrolling in areas of
high risk of conflict and to extend its presence to areas
of displacement, return and resettlement. It again
expressed its intention to consider “all appropriate
measures”, as demonstrated by its adoption of
resolution 2206 (2015), against those who undermined
the peace, stability and security of South Sudan.
92. In 2016, various Secretariat members spoke of a
fragile and dangerous situation, in its security as well
16/295

as humanitarian and human rights aspects, which had
the potential for escalation and atrocities. While the
Government was making some efforts to implement the
Agreement, violence, especially towards civilians,
continued. Member States and briefers alike urged
more concrete action to avoid large-scale violence.
93. Violence erupted in mid-2016. The Council
issued a statement to the press about events in Wau at
the end of June and called upon all parties to cease
hostilities. In Juba, the escalation of the fighting over
several days in July between the Sudan People’s
Liberation Army and the Sudan People’s Liberation
Army in Opposition resulted in many people being
killed or injured, leading Riek Machar to leave Juba
and ultimately the country. Two peacekeepers were
killed. The Council issued statements to the press on
9 and 10 July, in which it strongly condemned the
fighting. In the midst of the fighting, armed men in
military uniform committed murder, rape and looting at
the Terrain Hotel complex. At a briefing immediately
after the events, the Secretariat called for an arms
embargo in South Sudan.
94. The Council initially renewed the UNMISS
mandate for only a limited time in July 2016, by
resolution 2302 (2016). Then, in August 2016, the
Council adopted resolution 2304 (2016) by 11 votes in
favour, with 4 abstentions, and extended the mandate
of UNMISS until 15 December 2016. In the resolution,
the Council decided that UNMISS would include a
Regional Protection Force. The Council also decided
that it would consider appropriate measures, as
described in the annex to the resolution (a draft
resolution on arms embargo), if the Secretary-General
reported political or operational impediments to
operationalizing the Regional Protection Force or
obstructions to UNMISS in the performance of its
mandate, owing to the actions of the Transitional
Government of National Unity, within five days of
receipt of such report.
95. In September 2016, the Council visited South
Sudan. At the end of the visit, the Council issued a
joint communiqué with the Transitional Government of
National Unity, in which they agreed to work together
to advance the interests of the South Sudanese people,
and the Government of South Sudan gave its consent to
the deployment of the Regional Protection Force.
96. In December 2016, resolution 2326 (2016) was
adopted to extend the UNMISS mandate for one day,
after which the Council extended the mandate of
UNMISS until 15 December 2017, by resolution 2327
(2016). In the resolution, the Council renewed the
mandate of UNMISS and its Regional Protection Force
but did not annex a draft arms embargo. Later in
16-15226

-----------------------Page 16 End-----------------------

Introduction

December, the Council voted on a draft resolution by
which it would have imposed an arms embargo on
South Sudan and targeted sanctions on South Sudanese
individuals. The draft resolution did not receive the
necessary votes to be adopted.

102. In November 2016, the Council once more
extended the mandate of UNISFA, until 15 May 2017,
by resolution 2318 (2016).

97. UNMISS protected hundreds of thousands of
people at its sites, but not without problems. Criminal
activity was taking place and some of the tensions
present throughout the country were seen in microcosms
at the sites. The sites themselves were often subject to
attack, as seen in Malakal in February 2016. After that
attack, the Council condemned in the strongest terms
such violence in a statement to the press. UNMISS
personnel tried to adopt a more agile posture to better
protect civilians and themselves. The concern of the
United Nations and the international community over
this led to the issuance of a presidential statement
(S/PRST/2016/1), in which the Council expressed deep
alarm at the situation in South Sudan and called upon
the parties to fully implement the Agreement.

103. In March 2016, Morocco informed the United
Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara
(MINURSO) that civilian staff must leave the area of
operation. The Council held several meetings to
receive updates from the Secretariat and to discuss the
situation. The Council met in April to extend the
mandate of MINURSO for one year.

98. The Chair of the Committee established pursuant
to resolution 2206 (2015) concerning South Sudan
briefed the Council in August 2015 and in February
and November 2016. The Council twice renewed the
mandates of the Committee and the Panel of Experts in
a technical rollover. Finally, in resolution 2290 (2016),
the sanctions regime was renewed until 31 May 2017
and the mandate of the Panel of Experts was extended
until 1 July 2017.
Sudan, South Sudan and Abyei
99. By resolution 2251 (2015), the Council extended
the mandate of the United Nations Interim Security
Force for Abyei (UNISFA) until 15 May 2016, while
also calling for the withdrawal of armed elements from
the Abyei Area. In the resolution, the Council
expressed regret that a meeting of the Abyei Joint
Oversight Committee had not taken place.
100. The Council again extended the mandate of
UNISFA, until 15 November 2016, by resolution 2287
(2016). The Council requested the Force to observe,
document and report on the movement of weapons into
the region. The Council also reiterated the call to
appoint a civilian head of mission.
101. The Council issued a statement to the press in
November 2015, in which it condemned an attack by
unknown assailants on the residence of the Ngok Dinka
Paramount Chief in Abyei Town, which resulted in the
death of a UNISFA peacekeeper and a child.

Western Sahara

104. By resolution 2285 (2016), adopted by 10 votes
in favour to 2 against, with 3 abstentions, the Council
emphasized the urgent need for the Mission to return to
full functionality and called upon all parties to
cooperate fully with MINURSO and to continue
negotiations in good faith.
Peace consolidation in West Africa
105. Several meetings on peace consolidation in West
Africa were held in 2016, with the first in January. At
the meeting in January, the briefer highlighted several
peaceful elections that had been held in the region and
other elections that were forthcoming, and said that the
people of West Africa were dedicated to democratic
principles.
106. Challenges that were highlighted included violent
extremism and terrorism, perpetrated in particular by
Boko Haram, as well as drug trafficking and security
sector reform.
107. On 28 January, the members of the Security
Council requested the Secretary-General to proceed
with the merger of the United Nations Office for West
Africa (UNOWA) and the Office of the Special Envoy
for the Sahel, with a view to maximizing synergies by
ensuring a unified management and structure of the
new United Nations Office for West Africa and the
Sahel (UNOWAS).
108. In April 2016, a meeting was held specifically on
the subject of piracy and armed robbery at sea in the
Gulf of Guinea. The Council issued a presidential
statement (S/PRST/2016/4) in April 2016, in which it
referred to the link between piracy and the financing of
terrorism, urged regional organizations to enhance
cooperation and encouraged the international
community to assist in enhancing the capabilities of the
States affected to counter piracy.
109. By July 2016, UNOWA and the Office of the
Special Envoy for the Sahel had merged to form
UNOWAS. The July briefing, therefore, contained

Report of the Security Council to the General Assembly
(covering the period from 1 August 2015 to 31 December 2016)

information on the security challenges in the Sahel and
the greater Lake Chad Basin. The briefer said that,
without justice and job opportunities, desperation was
rising. It was urged that regional security forces be
strengthened.

focused on addressing the threats to peace, security and
development in the Sahel.

110. The Council issued a presidential statement
(S/PRST/2016/11) in July 2016, in which it welcomed
the merger of the two Offices, condemned terrorist
attacks, expressed concern about piracy and human and
drug trafficking, and looked forward to enhancing the
activities of UNOWAS, including in the area of respect
for the rule of law.

Haiti

Peace and security in Africa: Lake Chad Basin
111. A briefing on the security situation in the Lake
Chad Basin was held in July 2016. The main topic was
Boko Haram and the ensuing humanitarian crisis. The
increased number of both refugees and internally
displaced people put pressure on a region already
facing food insecurity. The international community
was urged to help the region, which had been facing
trade disruptions and budget shortfalls caused by the
security situation.
112. Council members spoke about the many
challenges facing the region, including poverty,
terrorism, organized crime and climate change.
Peace and security in Africa: Ebola
113. In August 2015, the Council held a meeting on
the global response to the outbreak in 2013 of Ebola
virus disease in West Africa. Briefers were optimistic
about the progress made, while urging continued
vigilance on the part of the international community.
Council members shared the same opinions.
Peace and security in Africa: Sahel
114. The Council met to discuss the situation in the
Sahel in November 2015 and May 2016. Briefers urged
international cooperation to address the Sahel’s many
continuing challenges. Climate change, in particular
desertification in the Sahel, was highlighted as a factor
of instability. Council members discussed how to
address root causes, the threat of terrorism in the
region, and the need to support political processes.
115. The Council issued a presidential statement
(S/PRST/2015/24) in December 2015, in which it
encouraged greater cooperation among all stakeholders
and called for the creation of opportunities for women
and youth and for cooperation by all to increase
economic and political progress. It welcomed the
establishment of the Group of Five for the Sahel,
which aimed to enhance ownership of the initiatives
18/295

Americas

116. During the reporting period, the situation in Haiti
was characterized by continuing discussions on the
state of the country’s electoral process. In October
2015, the Council was briefed about the successful
legislative elections held earlier that year. At that time,
the Secretary-General recommended that the United
Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH)
be extended for one more year with the same force and
police levels and to conduct a strategic assessment
mission to formulate recommendations for the future
presence of the United Nations in Haiti. In resolution
2243 (2015), adopted a few days later, the Council
endorsed the recommendation regarding force levels
and affirmed its intention, based on its review of the
overall capacity of Haiti to ensure security and of the
conditions on the ground, to consider the possible
withdrawal of MINUSTAH and transition to a future
United Nations presence beginning no sooner than
15 October 2016. In this regard, the Council requested
the Secretary-General to conduct a strategic assessment
mission to Haiti and, on that basis, to present to the
Council recommendations on the future presence and
role of the United Nations in Haiti, preferably by
90 days after the inauguration of the new President,
and ideally after the formation of a new government.
117. At a briefing in March 2016, the Special
Representative of the Secretary-General warned that
previous gains made in Haiti were challenged by the
contentious presidential election, which went through
two rounds. A last round was postponed, leading to the
swearing-in of a provisional president. Council
members called for the expeditious and peaceful
conclusion of the electoral process.
118. The briefing on the Secretary-General’s report on
MINUSTAH (S/2016/753) in October 2016 was
overshadowed by the recent landfall of Hurricane
Matthew on Haiti, which caused tremendous harm.
There was severe damage to infrastructure, many
people died and the elections were postponed. The
briefer called for significant international support for
Haiti. The Council responded by adopting resolution
2313 (2016), by which it extended the mandate of
MINUSTAH for six months and requested the
Secretary-General to conduct a strategic assessment
mission and to present recommendations to the Council
on the future role and presence of the United Nations
in Haiti.

Introduction

Identical letters dated 19 January 2016 from the
Permanent Representative of Colombia to the
United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General
and the President of the Security Council (S/2016/53)
119. In January 2016, by resolution 2261 (2016), the
Council established the United Nations Mission in
Colombia as a political mission of unarmed
international observers with the mandate to monitor
and verify the laying down of arms by the Government
of Colombia and the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias
de Colombia — Ejército del Pueblo (FARC-EP).
120. The Council welcomed the agreements reached in
Havana in June 2016. In a statement to the press, the
Council reiterated its full commitment to assisting the
peace process.
121. Steps to create the mission were taken throughout
the year, including the recommendations approved by
the Council in resolution 2307 (2016) in September
regarding the size and scope of the mission. Council
members praised the decision by Colombia to approach
the Council and urged Colombia to remain steadfast in
the search for peace, despite the setback of a
referendum on approving the peace agreement.

Middle East
The situation in the Middle East, including the
Palestinian question
122. The Council continued its previous practice with
regard to this agenda item, meeting each month on the
situation in the Middle East, including the Palestinian
question. The Middle East peace process and the
situations in Lebanon, Yemen and the Syrian Arab
Republic were addressed.
123. With regard to the Israeli-Palestinian issue,
violence continued between the two parties, including
clashes around holy sites highlighted in a statement to
the press issued by the Council in September 2015,
further diminishing hopes for a two-State solution. The
Secretariat urged the Council to act before a two -State
solution was eliminated as a possibility, saying that the
Middle East Quartet envoys had been discussing with
Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, the League of Arab
States, the Gulf Cooperation Council and other key
international partners how negotiations for a two -State
solution could be restarted.
124. Demolitions of West Bank structures continued,
as well as prolonged administrative detention of
Palestinians. The Council members voiced their
concerns about continued settlement activities.
Meanwhile, Gaza continued to be plagued by slow
16-15226

reconstruction and by security incidents. In November
2016, the Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian
Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator reported
that 70 per cent of the population of Gaza received
some form of international assistance. He also reported
that providing such assistance was becoming more
difficult under Israeli restrictions.
125. Council members continued to urge a cessation of
violence and inflammatory rhetoric from both sides.
They also urged development of economic opportunities
for Palestinians to give an avenue of hope for the
future. Council members stressed that a political
solution involving the two-State solution remained the
best way forward for peace. Member States called for
political will to be shown by both sides to establish a
peaceful solution. The Council condemned a terrorist
attack in Tel Aviv in June 2016 in a statement to the
press.
126. Late in 2016, the Special Coordinator for the
Middle East Peace Process said that two -State solution
was facing massive hurdles and asked for urgent
support from the Council. He specifically cited a more
aggressive attitude by Israeli settlement supporters as
the possibility of peaceful talks remained remote. The
Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon, gave his final
briefing on the subject in December 2016, during
which he expressed dismay at the lack of optimism on
this question.
127. Concern on the part of Council members about
the question of settlements, violence and the future of a
two-State solution culminated in the adoption on
23 December of resolution 2334 (2016), by 14 votes in
favour, with 1 abstention, in which the Council
reaffirmed the illegality of Israeli settlements in
Palestinian territory and their threat to the two -State
solution. The Council also condemned acts of violence,
called upon the parties to refrain from incitement and
inflammatory rhetoric, and called for immediate steps
to prevent all acts of violence against civilians and for
all parties to continue to exert collective efforts to
launch credible negotiations on all final-status issues in
the Middle East peace process within the time frame
specified by the Quartet in its statement of
21 September 2010.
128. The situation in Lebanon was reported by the
Secretariat to be calm, although remaining fragile. The
situation along the Blue Line and in the area of
operations of the United Nations Interim Force in
Lebanon remained calm.

Report of the Security Council to the General Assembly
(covering the period from 1 August 2015 to 31 December 2016)

The situation in the Middle East (Syrian
Arab Republic)
129. The Syrian Arab Republic was a significant focus
for the Council: meetings were held on the chemical
weapons and humanitarian tracks, and several meetings
on the political track were held nearly every month.
130. In August 2015, by resolution 2235 (2015), the
Council established, for one year, an OPCW -United
Nations Joint Investigative Mechanism to identify to
the greatest extent feasible individuals, entities, groups
or Governments that were perpetrators, organizers,
sponsors or otherwise involved in the use of chemicals
as weapons in the Syrian Arab Republic. The
Mechanism issued four reports during that period. Its
mandate was first extended until 31 October 2016 by a
letter dated 21 September 2016 from the President of
the Security Council to the Secretary-General
(S/2016/807). The Council then renewed the mandate
of the Mechanism, as set out in resolution 2235 (2016),
in a technical rollover by resolution 2314 (2016), and
for another year by resolution 2319 (2016).
131. In November and December 2015, a series of
meetings of the International Syria Support Group
were held in Vienna and New York, and the outcome of
those meetings resulted in the unanimous adoption of
resolution 2254 (2015) on 18 December 2015, in which
the Council expressed its support for a Syrian-led
political process facilitated by the United Nations and
for a nationwide ceasefire.
132. There were various attempts at a lasting ceasefire
throughout 2016. In February, by resolution 2268
(2016), the Council endorsed the cessation of
hostilities agreement brokered by the United States of
America and the Russian Federation, Co-Chairs of the
International Syria Support Group.
133. The Council continued to receive monthly
briefings on the implementation of resolutions 2139
(2014), 2165 (2014) and 2191 (2014), which detailed
the continuing deterioration of the humanitarian
situation. Civilians continued to be adversely affected.
In his report dated 14 December 2016 (S/2016/1057),
the Secretary-General reported that the humanitarian
situation continued to deteriorate throughout the Syrian
Arab Republic and that the continuing conflict posed
an immediate threat to millions of civilians every day,
especially those under attack and those who could not
be reached. Briefers also often spoke of the situation in
relation to the ongoing refugee crisis. In December
2015, by resolution 2258 (2015), the Council renewed
for one year the mandate allowing the United Nations
to deliver assistance across the border to the Syrian
Arab Republic through determined border crossings,
20/295

with notification to the Syrian authorities. A year later,
it renewed that mandate for an additional 12 months,
by resolution 2332 (2016).
134. The situation in the city of Aleppo received
particular attention, especially during the latter half of
2016. From 1 September 2016 until the end of 2016,
the situation in Aleppo was discussed at 10 Council
meetings.
135. The Council failed to adopt two draft resolutions
on the situation in Aleppo early in October 2016. It
also failed to adopt a draft resolution in December
2016. On 19 December, however, the Council adopted
resolution 2328 (2016), in which it requested the
United Nations to monitor evacuations from Aleppo
and demanded that all parties provide the United
Nations with safe, immediate and unimpeded access to
this end and to ensure the protection of civilians
throughout the Syrian Arab Republic, in accordance
with international humanitarian law.
136. After the announcement of the renewed cessation
of hostilities mediated by the Russian Federation and
Turkey, the Council adopted resolution 2336 (2016), in
which it welcomed and supported the efforts by those
two countries to end violence in the Syrian Arab
Republic and jumpstart a political process under the
auspices of the United Nations in Geneva.
137. In October 2016, the Council released a statement
to the press condemning reported attacks on schools in
which a number of children were killed. The Council
also released three statements to the press in which it
condemned terrorist attacks in the Syrian Arab Republic.
Iraq
138. When the Council took up the situation in Iraq in
November 2015 and in February, May, July and
November 2016, the members discussed various issues,
including the fight against ISIL, national reconciliation
and the humanitarian situation.
139. The Council issued statements to the press, in
which it condemned terrorist attacks in Iraq, in
January, May and July 2016. The Council also issued a
statement to the press regarding the Iraq-Kuwait issue
in July 2016.
140. The Council extended the mandate of the United
Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq until 31 July 2017,
by resolution 2299 (2016).

Introduction

Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL). In August 2015,
by resolution 2236 (2015), the Council extended the
mandate of UNIFIL until 31 August 2016. One year
later, by resolution 2305 (2016), the Council extended
it again, until 31 August 2017, and requested that the
Department of Peacekeeping Operations conduct a
strategic review of UNIFIL, owing to the Council’s
concern about the limited progress being made.
142. The Council issued a statement to the press in
May
2016
and
a
presidential
statement
(S/PRST/2016/10) in July 2016, in which it strongly
urged Lebanon to elect a new president.

147. The United Nations Verification and Inspection
Mechanism was launched in May 2016 to facilitate the
flow of commercial imports into Yemeni ports outside
Government control.
148. United Nations-sponsored peace talks were held
sporadically. The Special Envoy for Yemen continued to
engage in shuttle diplomacy and brief the Council on its
results. In March 2016, the Council welcomed through
a press release the announcement of a nationwide
cessation of hostilities and the launch of peace talks,
which the Council later supported again in a presidential
statement issued in April 2016 (S/PRST/2016/5).

143. In a presidential statement issued in November
2016 (S/PRST/2016/15), the Council welcomed the
election of the new President of Lebanon, Michel
Aoun. In December, the Council welcomed through a
statement to the press the positive news that a national
unity Government had been formed on 18 December. It
stressed the importance of the holding of parliamentary
elections by May 2017.

149. During the reporting period, the Council issued
statements to the press in which it welcomed the
different dialogues, in September, October and
December 2015 and in February and September 2016.

United Nations Disengagement Observer Force

150. The situation in Afghanistan remained fragile. It
was stressed that Afghanistan needed continued
international support in order to face its multitude of
challenges.

144. The Council adopted three resolutions by which it
renewed the mandate of the United Nations
Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF), for six
months each time (resolutions 2257 (2015), 2294
(2016) and 2330 (2016)). In those resolutions, the
Council stressed the importance of full adherence to
the Disengagement of Forces Agreement of 1974 and
called upon both sides to exercise maximum restraint.
The Council also expressed its concern about ISIL
actions in the area. The Council further welcomed the
return of UNDOF to its former headquarters at Camp
Faouar, on the Bravo side of the area of separation.

Asia
Afghanistan

151. The Council was informed in September 2015
that a series of critical government appointments had
been made. Council members commended these
positive actions and reiterated their continued support.
152. The security situation, however, remained
dangerous, and civilians continued to bear the brunt of
the violence, which intensified in 2015 and continued
throughout 2016.

Yemen

153. Many Council members urged regional support
for tackling all of Afghanistan’s challenges.

145. The humanitarian and security situation in Yemen
remains one of the most significant crises on the
Council’s agenda. As stated by the Special Envoy of
the Secretary-General for Yemen, Ismail Ould Cheikh
Ahmed, in his last briefing in 2016, instability marked
both the security and the humanitarian situation. The
economic situation was also deteriorating. In October
2016, the Council condemned through a statement to
the press the attack by Houthi forces on a United Arab
Emirates ship, stressing that there must be freedom of
navigation in Bab al-Mandab.

154. As previously requested by the Council, the
United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan
(UNAMA), on behalf of the Secretary-General and in
full consultation with the Government of Afghanistan
and donors, conducted an examination of the role,
structure and activities of all United Nations entities in
country. The results of that examination, presented to
the Council in September 2015 (see S/2015/713),
would in future allow the United Nations to coordinate
with the Government of Afghanistan and create better
UNAMA mandates.

146. The Council condemned all violations of
humanitarian laws and expressed serious concern about
the humanitarian situation in a statement to the press
issued in February 2016.

155. In a presidential statement (S/PRST/2016/14)
issued in September 2016, the Council called for
continued international assistance to Afghanistan in
advance of a donor conference, while underscoring the
importance of the progress made in the country.

(covering the period from 1 August 2015 to 31 December 2016)

Democratic People’s Republic of Korea
156. On 10 December 2015, the Council held a meeting
on the situation in the Democratic People’s Republic of
Korea. The meeting’s agenda was adopted after a
procedural vote of 9 in favour to 4 against, with
2 abstentions.
157. At that meeting, the United Nations High
Commissioner for Human Rights warned that the
human rights situation in the country remained of
grave concern. The Under-Secretary-General for
Political Affairs said that it was critical to determine an
effective way to address such human rights abuses.
158. Another meeting was held in December 2016,
with a procedural vote on the adoption of the agenda.
The agenda was adopted by 9 votes in favour to
5 against, with 1 abstention. The Deputy SecretaryGeneral and the Assistant Secretary-General for
Human Rights detailed no improvement in the human
rights situation in the Democratic People’s Republic of
Korea during 2016. They highlighted, among other
issues, poor custody conditions and food shortages.

Europe
Bosnia and Herzegovina
159. The Council held meetings on Bosnia and
Herzegovina in November 2015 and May 2016. By
resolution 2247 (2015), the Council authorized the
European Union-led multinational stabilization force
for a further period of 12 months, and did so again in
November 2016, by resolution 2315 (2016). Member
States continued to worry that, 20 years since the
Dayton Accords, there had not been significant
political reform and cooperation among all parties.
Council members did praise the signing of the
Stabilization and Association Agreement with the
European Union, which led to an application for
membership in February 2016.
160. There were differences in the Council on the
various actions of Republika Srpska, especially its
desire to hold an independence referendum. The
referendum was eventually cancelled.
Cyprus

resolution 2300 (2016), extended the mandate of
UNFICYP until 31 January 2017.
Security Council resolutions 1160 (1998), 1199
(1998), 1203 (1998), 1239 (1999), 1244 (1999)
162. The Council held six meetings on the United
Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo
(UNMIK), in August and November 2015 and in
February, May, August and November 2016. While no
longer administering the territory, UNMIK continued
to provide technical expertise and diplomatic efforts to
maintain calm.
163. The overall situation was stable, although there
continued to be underlying political and security
tensions, owing to disagreements over the status of
Kosovo and among the different ethnicities represented.
Meetings between Kosovo and Serbia continued to take
place. One of the most critical negotiations concerned
the establishment of the future association/community
of Serb-majority municipalities.
164. In February 2016, the Special Representative of
the Secretary-General and Head of UNMIK warned
that polarization between Serbia and Kosovo had
reached the point of impeding any further progress. He
warned that continued violence from the opposition
could have damaging consequences. The region also
faced challenges because of the ongoing influx of
migrants and refugees.
165. Council
members
praised
the
positive
achievements made that had given way to cautious
optimism for the future, including the adoption of a
constitutional amendment and laws on the establishment
of a special court for war crimes committed by the
Kosovo Liberation Army.
166. Several Council members commented on
procedural matters, remarking that the situatio n on the
ground was calm enough to decrease the frequency of
meetings on this subject. Others spoke in favour of
continuing the schedule. This disagreement was
reflected in positions concerning revisions to the
mandate. Some Council members urged representatives
of both parties to seriously consider ways to decrease
unhelpful nationalist rhetoric. They worried that such
rhetoric would reverse the positive gains made in the
previous years.

161. The Council held meetings on Cyprus twice in
2016, in January and July, and each time extended by
six months the mandate of the United Nations
Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP). In January,
by resolution 2263 (2016), the Council authorized an
increase in the force level. In July, the Council, by

unimplemented. The Assistant Secretary-General for
Human Rights called upon all the parties involved in
the hostilities to investigate all incidents of civilian
casualties caused by military action. A representative
of the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian

dangerous conditions along the contact line. Member
States urged implementation of the Minsk agreements.

173. Council members also continued to praise the
Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action as an example of
successful diplomacy in action. On 1 January 2016, the
provisions of resolution 1737 (2006) were terminated
and replaced under the terms of resolution 2231
(2015). Signatories were urged to continue to work
through challenges together.

strengthens the arms embargo, while renewing and
strengthening the sanctions regime imposed upon the
Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.
176. Urgent consultations continued to be held in
March, April, June and August, following the
continuation of launches using ballistic missile
technology, in violation of relevant Security Council
resolutions, and in September, immediately after the
fifth nuclear test conducted by the Democratic People ’s
Republic of Korea.
177. The Council adopted resolution 2321 (2016) in
November to create an even stronger sanctions regime
in response to the nuclear test of 9 September,
including a binding annual cap on the total export of
coal originating in the Democratic People’s Republic
of Korea.
178. With regard to the work of the Committee
established pursuant to resolution 1718 (2006), by
resolution 2276 (2016) of 24 March 2016, the Council
extended the mandate of the Panel of Experts and

Council held meetings on the work of United Nations
Police in peacekeeping. The Council was informed that
police personnel played an important technical
advisory role for host countries as well as positively
contributing to unarmed protection activities. Council
members stressed the need for appropriate training and
equipment, which personnel-contributing countries
should provide to carefully selected police personnel
who had experience in international humanitarian law
and had been trained to combat sexual-based violence,
and that attention should be paid to increasing
women’s representation in the police.

with regional and subregional organizations to achieve
national ownership.

198. For the first time in its history, the Council held a
meeting on trafficking in persons in situations of
conflict, in December 2015. There were briefings from

resolutions 1267 (1999) and 1989 (2011) concerning
Al-Qaida and associated individuals and entities
briefed the Council in October 2015 and warned that
Libya was vulnerable to exploitation by terrorist
groups owing to its security situation. Libya was also
strategically valuable to extremist groups because of its
geographic location and significant oil resources.
218. In November 2015, the Council adopted
resolution 2249 (2015), in which it condemned the
terrorist attacks that ISIL perpetrated or claimed
responsibility for in Sousse, in Ankara, over Sinai, in
Beirut and in Paris. It urged Member States to intensify
their efforts to stem the flow of foreign terrorist
fighters to Iraq and the Syrian Arab Republic and to
prevent and suppress the financing of terrorism.
219. By resolution 2253 (2015), adopted in December
2015 at a meeting of Ministers of Finance of Council
member States. the Council decided that the
Committee pursuant to resolutions 1267 (1999) and
1989 (2011) would be known as the Committee
pursuant to resolutions 1267 (1999), 1989 (2011) and
2253 (2015) concerning Islamic State in Iraq and the
Levant (Da’esh), Al-Qaida and associated individuals,
groups, undertakings and entities, and that the
Al-Qaida Sanctions List would be known as the ISIL
(Da’esh) and Al-Qaida Sanctions List.
220. ISIL was also the subject of a meeting in
February 2016, at which the Council was briefed that
ISIL remained a very serious threat, with vast
resources and manpower.
221. An open debate was held in April 2016 with wide
participation to discuss ways to counter terrorism

Introduction

globally in a comprehensive way, including cutting off
financing and the flow of foreign terrorist fighters, and
finding ways to combat their incitement online.
222. The ideas were further discussed at an open
debate in May. During that debate, the Council issued a
presidential statement (S/PRST/2016/6), in which it
requested the Counter-Terrorism Committee to present
by 30 April 2017 a proposal for a comprehensive
international framework to counter terrorist narratives
used in recruitment and incitement to violent acts.
223. Throughout these open debates, member States
highlighted international cooperation as critical for
stopping terrorist acts.
224. The Council held a ministerial-level meeting to
discuss methods to combat terrorism’s threat to civil
aviation in September 2016. It adopted resolution 2309
(2016), by which it called upon all States to work
within the International Civil Aviation Organization to
ensure that its international security standards were
reviewed and adapted to address effectively the threat
posed by terrorist targeting of civil aviation.
225. At the presentation of the third report of the
Secretary-General on the threat posed by ISIL
(S/2016/830), in October 2016, the Council was briefed
that, while ISIL continued to face military setbacks, it
was still a threat to international peace and security.
226. In December 2016, the Council held a briefing
and adopted resolution 2322 (2016), with the goal of
enhancing and fortifying international judicial
cooperation against terrorism.
International Tribunals for Rwanda and the
Former Yugoslavia
227. In November 2015, the Council adopted a
presidential statement (S/PRST/2015/21) in which it
requested the Informal Working Group on International
Tribunals to carry out an examination of the report of
the International Residual Mechanism for Criminal
Tribunals and present its findings for the Council’s
review of the work of the Mechanism. In December
2015, the Council was briefed by the Presidents and
Prosecutors of the Tribunals and the Mechanism,
including on the arrest of Ladislas Ntaganzwa.
Subsequently, the Council, by 14 votes in favour, with
1 abstention, adopted resolution 2256 (2015) to
conclude its review of the progress of the work of the
Mechanism and extend the mandates of judges of the
Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia. The Tribunal for
Rwanda completed its work on 31 December 2015,
which was marked by a statement to the press. In
February 2016, by resolution 2269 (2016) adopted by

16-15226

11 votes in favour, with 4 abstentions, the Council
appointed the Prosecutor of the Mechanism.
228. At a debate convened in June 2016, the
completion of some cases of the Tribunal for the
Former Yugoslavia was acknowledged. The necessity
for the Tribunal to keep the judicial timeline was
underlined. In December 2016, the Council heard a
briefing by the Presidents and Prosecutors of the
Tribunal and the Mechanism, during which concern
about staff attrition was stressed. Some Council
members called upon the Mechanism to use all
procedural options provided for in its statute to fulfil
its mandate effectively.
229. In September 2016, the Council, by resolution
2306 (2016), amended the statute of the Tribunal for
the Former Yugoslavia and, in December, by resolution
2329 (2016), extended the terms of office of the judges
of the Tribunal and reappointed the prosecutor of the
Tribunal under the condition that those would be the
final extensions and reappointment.
Briefing by the President of the International Court
of Justice
230. In November 2015 and October 2016, the
Council was briefed by the President of the
International Court of Justice. The President outlined
the overall activities of the Court, focusing on the
complementary roles that the Court and the Council
played in the promotion of the rule of law at the
international level.
Appointment of the Secretary-General of the
United Nations
231. Following six rounds of straw polls, the first of
which was held in July 2016, the Council issued on
6 October 2016 a communiqué in which it noted that it
had adopted by acclamation resolution 2311 (2016),
which read:
The Security Council,
Having considered the question of the
recommendation for the appointment of the
Secretary-General of the United Nations,
Recommends to the General Assembly that
Mr. António Guterres be appointed SecretaryGeneral of the United Nations for a term of office
from 1 January 2017 to 31 December 2021.
232. On 14 December, the Council adopted by
acclamation resolution 2324 (2016) to pay tribute to
the outgoing Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon.

(covering the period from 1 August 2015 to 31 December 2016)

Other matters
Implementation of the note by the President of the
Security Council (S/2010/507)
233. In October 2015, the Council convened the
annual open debate on its working methods under the
item entitled “Implementation of the note be the
President of the Security Council (S/2010/507)”. The
debate was based on the concept paper distributed by
Spain (S/2015/793, annex), in which it was proposed
that the discussion focus on how the Council could
continue to improve its efficiency and transparency, in
addition to its interaction and dialogue with
non-members of the Council and bodies. Member
States expressed a range of views, including on the
process of selecting and appointing the next SecretaryGeneral. A presidential statement (S/PRST/2015/19)
was issued 10 days after the debate, in which, among
other things, the Council requested the Informal
Working Group on Documentation and Other
Procedural Questions to continue reviewing and
updating relevant notes by the President of the Security
Council, in particular note S/2010/507 of 26 July 2010,
including with a focus on implementation.

delegations stressed the importance of the Council’s
continuous efforts to improve its transparency, while
ensuring its ability to act effectively and efficiently.
While welcoming the improvements made in recent
years, including the recent adoption of another note
(S/2016/619), many delegations called for fuller and
more even implementation of the presidential notes,
and looked forward to the reviewing and updating of
note S/2010/507 by the Informal Working Group on
Documentation and Other Procedural Questions,
including with a focus on implementation, as requested
in the statement by the President (S/PRST/2015/19).
The Informal Working Group started deliberations on
the specific ideas and proposals made at the open
debate, as it worked on reviewing and updating note
S/2010/507.
236. The Council held six wrap-up sessions (in August
and October 2015 and in January, February, May and
August 2016) to review its work and consider how the
it could improve its efficiency and effectiveness, in
particular in dealing with country-specific situations,
conflict prevention and its working methods.
Subsidiary bodies

234. In response to the decision by the General
Assembly to conduct the elections of the
non-permanent members of the Security Council about
six months before the elected members assume their
responsibilities (resolution 68/307), the Council, in its
Informal Working Group on Documentation and Other
Procedural Questions, started discussions in 2016 on
improving transitional arrangements for its newly
elected members. In July 2016, the Council adopted a
note by the President (S/2016/619). A product of
intensive work on the part of the Working Group over
several months, the note outlined measures to facilitate
the preparation of newly elected members and improve
the selection process for and the preparation of Chairs
of subsidiary organs.

237. In December 2015, the five outgoing
non-permanent members (Chad, Chile, Jordan,
Lithuania, and Nigeria) briefed the Council on the
committees that they had chaired.

235. In July 2016, on the tenth anniversary of the
adoption of the previous note by the President on the
working methods of the Council (S/2006/507), the
Council convened an open debate on its working
methods under the item entitled “Implementation of the
note by the President of the Security Council
(S/2010/507)”. The debate was based on the concept
paper distributed by Japan (S/2016/585, annex), in
which it was proposed that the Council, with the
participation of interested delegations from the wider
membership, look at the implementation of note
S/2010/507 and other relevant notes to identify
successful practices as well as possible shortcomings,
and consider making necessary adjustments. Many

240. On 20 October 2015, the Council adopted its
annual report for the period from 1 August 2014 to
31 July 2015. On 12 November, the Permanent
Representative of the United Kingdom of Great Britain
and Northern Ireland, in his capacity as President of
the Council for the month, presented the annual report
to the General Assembly.

28/295

238. On 4 May 2016, the three Chairs of terrorismrelated committees briefed the Council on their
ongoing duties, cooperation and goals for the future.
239. In December 2016, the five outgoing
non-permanent members (Angola, Malaysia, New
