MESSAGE FROM THE
PRESIDENT

The past year brought good news in the form of
renewed growth in Latin America and the Ca-
ribbean. Inflation rates have settled significantly
during this recovery, keeping the purchasing
power of millions of households from eroding.
   Unemployment, however, is still on the rise,
albeit more slowly than in previous years. Capping
unemployment in the region is a priority, since
social gains such as plunging poverty rates and the burgeoning middle class
are at risk of reversal.
   To prevent these risks from becoming reality, it is crucial to accelerate the
pace of growth across the region. The challenge is to achieve this goal with-
out relying on a significant increase in the prices of the products we export,
as in the past decade, and to do so with almost nonexistent fiscal leeway.
   Responsible public policies are indispensable for a region that still has a
long to-do list. As we have been insisting here at the IDB, one of our most
complex challenges is to improve productivity, driven by reforms that lead to
higher quality of education, more efficient judicial systems, larger increases
in labor formality rates, and more enabling environments for entrepreneur-
ship and private investment.
   The IDB Group has a tradition, going back more than half a century, of
operations that have contributed to our understanding and keen awareness
of the needs of the countries of Latin America and the Caribbean. In keeping
with that tradition, the IDB Group continued to aggressively pursue a robust
program of support in 2017. Specifically, we approved 90 sovereign guaran-
teed operations for $11.4 billion, a volume 23 percent greater than in 2016. At
the same time, with a net positive flow of resources to the region, the IDB
disbursed more than $8.9 billion.




                                                       IDB ANNUAL REPORT 2017      1
-----------------------Page 7 End-----------------------

          It is essential that we support the return of Latin America and the Caribbean
       to its accelerated growth path, and now is a particularly good time to contribute
       to the policy dialogue to forward this objective. In the next two years, the region
       will hold at least 12 presidential elections. The IDB Group, through its loans, tech-
       nical cooperation, and resource mobilization, can support the sectors driving
       that acceleration. This support will entail not only lending resources but also a
       greater programming effort to target interventions in that direction.
          I say this with the certainty that the IDB Group is a relevant organization that
       has successfully evolved over the years. It is, and will remain, essential to the
       goal of building a more prosperous, equitable, and democratic region. The chal-
       lenges will never cease, so long as poverty persists.

I.     OPERATIONAL
       SUMMARY


 Loan Approvals

 In 2017, the Bank approved 90 sovereign guaranteed loan operations for a total financing
 amount of $11.4 billion. The sovereign guaranteed loan approval program included 73
 investment projects for $7.9 billion and 17 policy-based loan projects for $3.4 billion. The
 investment projects included 16 operations for $2.9 billion under conditional credit lines
 for investment projects (CCLIPs) and one multiphase operation for $238 million. Of the 17
 policy-based projects, two were multiple-tranches operations for $300 million, one was a
 hybrid project for $160 million, and 14 were programmatic loans for a total of $3 billion. Of
 the programmatic loans, eight corresponded to early-stage operations, for a total of $1.9
 billion, and six were for subsequent-stage projects, for a total of $1.1 billion.1


     The total cost of the projects financed under the sovereign guarantee loan approval pro-
 gram was $13.6 billion. This amount includes $11.1 billion of loans from the Bank’s Ordinary
 Capital (OC), three projects under the IDB Grant Facility for $128 million, $113 million from
 Funds under the Bank’s Administration and $2.2 billion from other sources and local contri-
 butions. The Bank approved seven new CCLIPs in 2017 for a total of $6.9 billion.
     The share of loans to small and vulnerable Group C and D countries in total approvals
 reached 34 percent in 2017. Approvals for Group C and D countries increased 9 percent,
 from $3.5 billion in 2016 to $3.8 billion in 2017. As a result, during 2017 the Bank continued to
 solidify its status as the leading source of multilateral financing for the Latin American and
 Caribbean region, particularly with respect to support for Group C and D countries.
     In terms of sectors, the Bank allocated 38 percent of approved financing to the Infrastruc-
 ture and Energy Sector, 39 percent to the Institutions for Development Sector, 13 percent
 to the Climate and Sustainable Development Sector, 8 percent to the Social Sector, and 2

      During the year, 98 non-sovereign guaranteed loans originated by the Inter-American Investment Corporation were
 cofinanced by the Bank, for a total of $1.8 billion. When this amount is added to the $11.4 billion in sovereign loan ap-
 provals above, together with an additional $235 million in non-sovereign guaranteed loan approvals from trust funds,
 the Bank’s volume of approvals for the year totaled $13.5 billion.

II. HIGHLIGHTS
    BY SECTOR


  Institutions for Development Sector (IFD)

  In 2017, IFD emphasized efforts to realize the digital economy’s potential and to create more
  effective and efficient institutions.
      In the area of innovation in citizen services, activities helped strengthen the institutional
  capacity of governments to improve the quality of public service delivery, which included:
  (i) e-government and expansion of government services online; (ii) improved efficiency and
  service quality in issuing identification documents, birth certificates, passports, and prop-
  erty titles; (iii) online access to information on government activities; (iv) data availability and
  analysis capacity for evidence-based policymaking; (v) centralized government units to mon-
  itor and evaluate the fulfillment of government priorities; and (vi) improved police training,
  criminal investigation laboratories, and social reintegration of former inmates.
      In the area of fiscal management, efforts focused on supporting significant investments to
  strengthen public finances at the national and subnational levels, and on providing technical
  cooperation in tax policy, revenue administration, and public expenditure quality. The main
  activities included programs to support regulatory framework reforms for fiscal discipline as
  well as transparency and accountability mechanisms for subnational governments; invest-
  ments to increase tax revenue intake and resources for efficient cash flow management; and
  technical cooperation to improve revenue collection, public expenditure management and
  to narrow investment gaps in strategic sectors and geographic areas. Notable initiatives in
  digital fiscal management were the development of technological applications to improve
  subnational tax administration.
      In connectivity, markets, and finance, support to countries focused on instruments to
  maximize private-sector leverage in financing productive infrastructure and climate change,
  financial inclusion, closing access gaps in digital connectivity, and facilitating the transition to
  a digital economy. This support was possible thanks to a combination of policy and institu-
  tional reforms, priority investments, and technical cooperation, in particular: (i) guarantees,
  insurance, green bonds, and investment in climate change mitigation, promoted through work
  with national development banks; (ii) digital applications to expand access to quality financial
  services for low-income households and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs); (iii) sus-
  tainable development policies for the fintech industry; and (iv) risk management tools, digital

Argentina: Villa 31, the largest informal settlement in the city of Buenos Aires, is home to
roughly 43,000 people, with 67 percent of families living below the poverty line. As part of
a flagship program to improve the quality of life of its residents, the municipal government is
seeking to expand access to social services, especially education, to upgrade infrastructure,
and to improve housing conditions. IDB Group support includes a loan from IDB Invest
to finance road improvements and an IDB loan focused on housing, water quality and
construction of an education hub. Photo: Luiz Gabriel Azevedo.
