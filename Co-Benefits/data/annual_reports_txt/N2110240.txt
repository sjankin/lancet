Introduction
1.
Mindful of its primary responsibility for the
maintenance of international peace and security, the
Security Council continued to carry out its activities in
accordance with the purposes and principles of the
Charter of the United Nations. During the reporting
period, from 1 January to 31 December 2020, the
Council held 81 in-person meetings and 269
videoconferences, adopted 57 resolutions in person and
by written procedure and issued 13 presidential
statements and 46 statements to the press. It was unable
to hold in-person meetings and conduct several field
missions as a result of the coronavirus disease
(COVID-19) pandemic, which had an impact on its work
in general and on its working methods.
2.
In 2020, the international situation was marked by
crises, despite the call by the Secretary-General for a
global ceasefire to focus on combating the COVID-19
pandemic. The Council continued to closely monitor
ongoing conflict in Africa, Latin America and the
Middle East, including the situation in Libya, the Syrian
Arab Republic and Yemen and the Palestinian question,
which continued to have serious repercussions
throughout the subregion.
3.
The situation in Africa continued to occupy an
important place in the work of the Council. Numerous
meetings were held, including on the Central African
Republic, Libya and South Sudan. The need for
reinforcing close cooperation with the African Union
facilitated the holding of the annual consultations, by
videoconference, between the members of the Security
Council and those of the Peace and Security Council of
the African Union, in September 2020.
4.
The Council discussed the situation in Cyprus and
continued to follow the work of the United Nations
Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK)
and the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
5.
The Council also discussed the situation in Haiti
and the activities of the new United Nations Integrated
Office in Haiti (BINUH). It continued to follow the
work of the United Nations Verification Mission in
Colombia.
6.
In addition, other threats to international peace and
security resulting from acts of terrorism were regularly
monitored by the Council. Particular attention was given
to the fight against the financing of terrorism and other
related challenges.

7.
The Council remained seized of issues related to
non-proliferation, the protection of civilians in armed
conflict, peacekeeping and peacebuilding, sanctions,
climate change, natural disasters and cooperation
between the United Nations and regional and subregional
organizations.
8.
More information on the provisional measures and
working methods agreed by the Council because of the
COVID-19 pandemic, activities of the Council and
detailed records of its meetings can be found in the
monthly assessments of its work. 1 Records of all public
meetings, including the names and titles of speakers, are

Introduction

Security Council resolution 1874 (2009) concerning the
Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.
160. On 14 August, the Council did not adopt, by a vote
of 2 to 2, with 11 abstentions, a draft resolution by which
it would have extended the arms-related restrictions on
the Islamic Republic of Iran under resolution 2231
(2015), which were scheduled to expire in October.
161. At videoconferences held in June and December,
the Council discussed the implementation of its
resolution 2231 (2015), by which it had endorsed the
Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action on the Iranian
nuclear issue. In December, the Under-SecretaryGeneral for Political and Peacebuilding Affairs
reiterated her support for this “pillar” of the
non-proliferation architecture.
162. In August, 13 members of the Council explicitly
stated in their communication that, by withdrawing from
the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, the United
States had lost any rights to make use of the instruments
provided for in resolution 2231 (2015), including those
outlined in paragraph 11, and that attempts by the United
States to claim otherwise were not legitimate and
therefore could not have any legal, political or practical
implications.
International Residual Mechanism for
Criminal Tribunals
163. On 28 February 2020, the Council issued a
presidential statement (S/PRST/2020/4), in which it

of its functions, since its previous review, in June 2018.
164. Having conducted its review of the progress of the
work of the Mechanism, since the previous review of the
Mechanism in June 2018, pursuant to paragraph 17 of
resolution 1966 (2010) and in accordance with the
procedure set out in the presidential statement of
28 February 2020 (S/PRST/2020/4), on 25 June, the
Council adopted resolution 2529 (2020), by which it
reappointed Serge Brammertz as Prosecutor of the
Mechanism, for a term of two years with effect from
1 July 2020, and welcomed the report (S/2020/309)
submitted by the Mechanism to the Council.
165. The President of the Residual Mechanism, Carmel
Agius, and the Prosecutor of the Residual Mechanism
presented the third review report (S/2020/309) and

General Dennis Gyllensporre, the Force Commander of
the United Nations Mission in South Sudan, Lieutenant
General Shailesh Tinaikar, and the Deputy Force
Commander of the United Nations Disengagement
Observer Force, Brigadier General Maureen O’Brien,
briefed the Council on the significant impact that the
COVID-19 pandemic had on the implementation of the
mandates of United Nations peacekeeping missions
around the world. Council members expressed their
support for those missions and paid tribute to the
peacekeepers who had died in the service of peace.
168. On 28 August, the Council adopted resolution
2538 (2020), in which it called upon Member States, the
Secretariat and regional organizations to strengthen
their collective efforts towards the full and effective
participation of women in peacekeeping operations.

videoconference its annual debate on United Nations
peacekeeping operations. Several members welcomed
the Action for Peacekeeping initiative of the Secretary General, launched in March 2018.
170. On 4 November, the Council held its annual
videoconference briefing with the heads of police
components of peace operations in the Central Afr ican
Republic, Haiti, Mali and South Sudan, who briefed the
Council on the working conditions and the role of their
contingents in theatres of operation, in particular with
regard to capacity-building, the protection of civilians
and upholding human rights.
United Nations peacekeeping operations and
human rights
171. At a videoconference held on 7 July 2020, the
United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights
informed the Council that the integration of human
rights components in peacekeeping operations brought
missions closer to the people, and she recalled the
urgency of addressing human rights violations, in
particular during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Protection of civilians in armed conflict
172. On 29 April 2020, the Council issued a presidential
statement (S/PRST/2020/6), in which it recalled the link
21/237

-----------------------Page 23 End-----------------------

Report of the Security Council to theGeneral Assembly for 2020

between armed conflict, violence and conflict-induced
food insecurity and the threat of famine and reiterated
the need to pursue all possible avenues to prevent and
end armed conflicts, including by addressing their
underlying root causes in an inclusive, integrated and
sustainable manner.
173. The Council held its annual open debate on the
protection of civilians in armed conflict in the form of
an open high-level videoconference on 27 May. The
Secretary-General presented his annual report on the
protection of civilians (S/2020/366), noting that little
progress had been made in 2019 on the protection of
civilians and compliance with international law. He
emphasized the importance of taking further steps to
strengthen compliance and accountability with regard to
the protection of civilians.
174. At a videoconference held on 17 September on the
topic of conflict-induced hunger, the Council heard
briefings by the Executive Director of the World Food
Programme,
the
Under-Secretary-General
for
Humanitarian Affairs
and
Emergency
Relief
Coordinator and the Director General of the Food and
Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, Qu
Dongyu.
175. At a videoconference held on 3 November under
the chairmanship of the Prime Minister of Saint Vincent
and the Grenadines, Ralph Gonsalves, the Council
discussed contemporary drivers of conflict and
insecurity.
Women and peace and security
176. At an open videoconference held on 17 July 2020
to discuss the annual report of the Secretary-General on
conflict-related sexual violence (S/2020/487), the
Special Representative of the Secretary-General on
Sexual Violence in Conflict, Pramila Patten, told the
Council that sexual violence was increasingly used
around the world as a tactic of war and a tool of political
repression to dehumanize, destabilize and forcibly
displace populations.
177. At a videoconference held on 29 October for the
annual discussion of the Council on women and peace
and security, the Secretary-General, the Executive
Director of the United Nations Entity for Gender
Equality and the Empowerment of Women
(UN-Women),
Phumzile
Mlambo-Ngcuka,
the
UN-Women Goodwill Ambassador Danai Gurira, field

effective participation of women at all stages of peace
processes.
22/237

178. On 30 October, a draft resolution on women and
peace and security received 5 votes in favour, with 10

Assistant Secretary-General for Europe, Central Asia
and the Americas, Miroslav Jenča, and other experts
briefed the Council on the risks exacerbated by climate
change in specific countries or regional contexts.
Several Council members called for the early
appointment of a special representative of the SecretaryGeneral on climate and security and a report of the
Secretary-General on climate-related security risks,
while some objected that climate considerations did not
belong to the agenda of the Council.

Working methods
180. On 15 May 2020, the Council held by
videoconference its annual discussion on the theme
“Ensuring transparency, efficiency and effectiveness in
the work of the Council” in accordance with the note by
the President of the Security Council on the working
methods of the Council (S/2017/507).
