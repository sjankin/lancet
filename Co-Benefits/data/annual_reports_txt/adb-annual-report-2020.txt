 Working Group on Gender Diversity
 The Board of Directors is committed to improving the gender diversity of the Board. It recognizes that diversity enhances the
 quality and credibility of the Board’s decision-making, particularly in the context of our goal under Strategy 2030 to accelerate
 progress in gender equality. In September 2020, the Board established the Working Group on Gender Diversity to help build a
 more diverse Board membership. The group will identify constraints to improving gender diversity on the ADB Board of
 Directors and possible ways to address these. It will encourage well-qualified women to seek positions, such as by raising
 awareness about ADB and the work of the Board, and by mentoring. Working through Constituency Offices, it will also encourage
 ADB member authorities to take gender diversity of the Board as a whole into account in making Board appointments.

  Code of Conduct for Directors, Alternate Directors,
  and the President
                                                                                     ALTERNATE DIRECTORS
  The Ethics Committee (EC) completed its review of the Board
  Code of Conduct, Ethics Committee and Procedures, and
  Associated Guidelines applicable to ADB Directors, Alternate
  Directors, and the President. The review recommended
  amendments to bring these standards and procedures into line
  with the best practices of ADB’s peer institutions and the ADB
  Staff Code of Conduct. The changes included the requirement
  to complete a declaration of compliance relating to financial
  interests, and the duty to report any form of misconduct
  through appropriate channels. Amendments relating to the
  EC and the Office of Anticorruption and Integrity (OAI)
  included establishing a referral mechanism between the EC
  and OAI, updating guidelines, and defining the specific role and
  responsibilities of the EC in future misconduct investigations.
  The Board approved the revised Code of Conduct, Ethics
  Committee and Procedures, and Associated Guidelines in
  January 2020. They became effective on 13 February 2020.

                 - = nil, 0 = less than $500,000. Notes: (i) Beginning 2020, in reporting commitments from its internal resources ADB will include nonsovereign
                 revolving programs (the Trade Finance Program, Supply Chain Finance Program, and Microfinance Program). Inclusion of ADB’s exposure (or
                 committed redeployed capital) under nonsovereign revolving programs fully reflects the total financing committed, while at the same time, ADB
                 reports on cofinancing mobilized by these revolving programs. Commitments under nonsovereign revolving programs will distinguish long-term and
                 short-term financing. (ii) Numbers may not sum precisely because of rounding.
                 a
                   	 Commitment is the financing approved by the ADB Board of Directors or Management for which the legal agreement has been signed by the
                     borrower, recipient, or the investee company and ADB. It is the amount indicated in the investment agreement that may or may not be equal to the
                     approved amount, depending on the exchange rate at the time of signing. In the case of official and commercial cofinancing not administered by ADB
                     for which the signed amount is not readily available, the approved amount is used. The 2016–2019 figures for ADB-financed commitments from
                     nonsovereign revolving programs and cofinancing generated from Transaction Advisory Services are included as adjustments to complement the
                     change in coverage of 2020.
                 b
                   	 The Trade Finance Program represents 92% of this figure and supported 7,178 transactions in the reporting period, with an average maturity of 159 days.
                 c
                   	 Special funds other than Asian Development Fund such as the Asia Pacific Disaster Response Fund and the Climate Change Fund.
                 d
                   	 The 2018 adjusted figure includes $264 million under sovereign cofinancing for two projects reported in 2020.
                 e
                   	 The 2019 adjusted figures include $532 million under sovereign cofinancing commitments for five projects.
                 f
                  	 “Others” includes cofinancing for sovereign operations from other sources such as concessionaires, foundations, government entities, commercial
                     banks, and sovereign wealth funds.
                 g
                   	 Nonsovereign cofinancing includes commercial cofinancing such as B loans and parallel loans, among others. B loans are cofinancing arrangements
                     involving the coordinated process of pooling funds from various sources for a single borrower or grant recipient, and/or distributing related risks among
                     such other financiers. The 2019 adjusted figure excludes $65 million in nonsovereign cofinancing due to change in signing date from 2019 to 2020.
