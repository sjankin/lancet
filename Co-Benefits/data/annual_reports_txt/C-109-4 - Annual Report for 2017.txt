FOREWORD

The year 2017 will no doubt be remembered for the launching of the process to develop a global
compact for safe, orderly and regular migration, the first global intergovernmental agreement
prepared under the auspices of the United Nations to cover all dimensions of international migration.

The entire Organization has been involved in IOM’s work to support the global compact process.
Throughout 2017, IOM actively supported the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for
International Migration, the President of the General Assembly, the co-facilitators of the global
compact process and, most importantly, Member States. Moreover, IOM also provided extensive
assistance in the preparation and organization of the six thematic sessions, and for the stocktaking
preparatory meeting held in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico. In 2017, the Organization also devoted the
International Dialogue on Migration and the seventh Global Meeting of Chairs and Secretariats of
Regional Consultative Processes on Migration to the global compact for migration.

Another focus of work was IOM’s participation in United Nations governance processes. When IOM
entered the United Nations system in 2016, it became fully integrated into the United Nations principal
coordination bodies, including the Chief Executives Board for Coordination and its subsidiary bodies.
IOM is also invited to attend the meetings of the Executive Committee and the Deputies Committee
when matters relevant to IOM’s mandate are discussed. IOM now participates in numerous
United Nations inter-agency networks to improve general coordination and to exchange good
practices in areas as diverse as security, legal matters, internal audits, evaluation, strategic planning
and communications.

The third important UN-related line of activity was the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for
Sustainable Development. In 2017, 102 IOM offices supported governments in the implementation of
migration aspects of the Sustainable Development Goals, most frequently in partnership with other
United Nations agencies and in the context of United Nations Development Assistance Frameworks.

The Organization continued to assist States in their efforts to ensure adherence to migration-related
international standards, while maintaining its commitment to such standards in its own work, for
instance in relation to humanitarian action, gender equality, accountability to affected populations or
environmental sustainability. The IOM Migration Data Governance Policy was also launched to provide
the first framework to manage data across the Organization. In the field, IOM provided governments
with support to align migration laws with international standards and to develop concomitant policies
and procedures. This is the case, for instance, for labour mobility facilitation, for which, in 2017,
49 per cent of IOM offices helped governments develop legal and administrative infrastructures.
Similar work was conducted in the areas of migrant integration, human trafficking and smuggling,
environmental migration, return and resettlement, and migrant health.

In 2017, crisis-related programming, including in the fields of crisis preparedness, crisis response and
transition, recovery and stabilization, remained one of the busiest areas of intervention for IOM. Crisis-
related programming reached over 28.9 million people in more than 79 countries, including in
seven internal Level 3 emergencies. The internal Emergency Preparedness Monitoring Report was
established to reinforce the Organization’s capacity to anticipate and respond promptly to imminent
hazards. The Data Tracking Matrix was deployed in 54 countries and further developed to collect
reliable baseline data on human trafficking and migrant vulnerability in situations of displacement and
large-scale migration. As in past years, resettlement remained a core function of the Organization, with
support provided to 42 States in conducting resettlement and humanitarian admissions for
137,839 refugees and other vulnerable persons.

In a departure from former practice, the Annual Report for 2017 includes information that was
previously issued separately in the Organizational Effectiveness Report. The rationale for this change
is quite straightforward: with its increasing capacity to track, evaluate and report its activities, the
Organization is now able to deliver an integrated report offering a narrative on its activities and
information on the results of its work.

From an administrative perspective, IOM remains a principled, accountable and transparent
organization. As it continues its transition towards a results-based approach, it also seeks to enhance
its knowledge management and risk-management capabilities. At the same time, IOM is working to
increase its budget through more flexible funding and expand both its membership and network of
partnerships, particularly with the private sector. In 2017, the Administrative Part of the Budget
increased by CHF 5.2 million (an increase of 11.5%) and the Operational Part of the Budget increased
by USD 152 million (an increase of 9.6%).

Lastly, I am pleased to note that the Annual Report shows, once again, that we continue to have a cost-
efficient structure, with most of the funds going directly to service delivery. I convey the Annual Report
to the Member States and welcome their feedback on the information it contains.

                                                                                                   Page 3


NEW REPORTING STRUCTURE

1.        The format used to report on the work of the Organization in 2017 is slightly different from
previous years. As the Organization is moving towards a more efficient and results-oriented approach,
it has presented its results in the field, as well as its achievements relating to internal performance, in
a single report, the Annual Report.

2.       In the present report, the Organization’s activities have remained grouped according to the
three principles and three objectives of MiGOF, and its corresponding results framework, and the
information provided is based on the results of the institutional questionnaire. The sections previously
reported in the Organizational Effectiveness Report have been incorporated in the Annual Report,
showing a clearer link between field achievements and the efficiency and effectiveness of the
supporting structure and processes. A timeline of global events and IOM highlights in 2017 is contained
in Annex I.


IOM MAKING A GLOBAL IMPACT

Global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration

3.       The global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration will be the first agreement
negotiated at the intergovernmental level, prepared under the auspices of the United Nations, to cover
all dimensions of international migration in a comprehensive manner.

4.        The entire Organization has been involved in IOM’s work to support the global compact
process. Throughout 2017, IOM actively supported the Special Representative of the Secretary-
General for International Migration, the President of the General Assembly, the co-facilitators of the
global compact process and, most importantly, Member States. Policy and technical support promoted
informed dialogue on migration issues among Member States and relevant stakeholders and the
sharing of lessons learned, thus enabling the global compact to reflect different regional perspectives
and realities.

5.         IOM provided extensive assistance in the preparation and organization of the six thematic
sessions, and for the stocktaking preparatory meeting held in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico. (See Annex II
for a list of the thematic sessions and preparatory meetings that took place in 2017.) To inform
discussions in the consultations phase and help generate ideas and recommendations, IOM prepared
papers on many of the 24 themes set forth in Annex II of the New York Declaration for Refugees and
Migrants, and provided inputs to the Report of the Secretary-General, Making migration work for all.
The Organization also devoted both the 2017 IDM and the seventh Global Meeting of Chairs and
Secretariats of Regional Consultative Processes on Migration to the global compact for migration.

6.        IOM also initiated a range of activities to promote the participation of all governments in the
process to develop the global compact, while also ensuring that the greatest number and variety of
stakeholders had a voice in the process. The Organization created the Migration Research Leaders
Syndicate, through which the world’s leading migration researchers from diverse geographical and
thematic backgrounds share their expertise in and innovative solutions for migration issues in support
of the global compact. This contributed to enhancing policymakers’ understanding of some complex
migration issues. IOM supported civil society networks in the organization of seven regional civil
society consultations, covering all regions, and a global civil society stocktaking meeting prior to the
above-mentioned preparatory meeting for Member States held in Puerto Vallarta.

7.         The Organization also established the iDiaspora Platform, thereby broadening the scope for
civil society input, building new partnerships at the regional level and encouraging civil society to

interface with governments on the global compact for migration. Other related initiatives included
IOM engagement at the local level with cities through the Mayoral Forum, held in June, in Berlin, and
the Global Conference on Cities and Migration, held in November, in Mechelen, Belgium.

8.       IOM also facilitated the travel of over 40 government representatives from developing
countries and over 60 representatives from civil society to regional and global meetings for the global
compact.

9.       At the regional level, 13 offices supported the United Nations Regional Commissions in the
organization of regional consultations on the global compact for migration, and 20 offices were
engaged in supporting RCP meetings on the compact. Several RCPs and Regional Commissions
submitted their outcome documents and recommendations as input to the global compact.

10.       At the national level, more than 70 offices engaged with their host governments in national
or subregional consultations on the global compact, encouraging a whole-of-government approach to
migration policymaking. The national consultations raised awareness of the importance of engaging in
the global compact process, contributed to capacity-building on migration issues and helped to
consolidate government priorities and prepare States for meaningful engagement in the various global
and regional meetings on the compact. As a result, a number of governments, including the
Governments of Ethiopia, Guinea-Bissau, Mongolia and Thailand, expressed interest in establishing a
national coordination mechanism for migration.

11.       Cognizant of the challenge of ensuring complementarity and policy coherence between the
global compact for migration and the global compact on refugees as the two processes evolve, IOM
recruited a consultant to work on how the two compacts interrelate. Through this arrangement, more
open and regular communication channels were established with UNHCR on the linkages between the
global compacts. In the field, 14 offices were involved in meetings related to the global compact on
refugees.

IOM and the United Nations

12.       When IOM entered the United Nations system in 2016, it became fully integrated into the
United Nations principal coordination bodies, as outlined in the UN–IOM Agreement, including the
United Nations System Chief Executives Board for Coordination and its subsidiary bodies: the High-
level Committee on Programmes, the High-level Committee on Management and the UNDG. In
addition, IOM is invited to attend the meetings of the Executive Committee and the Deputies
Committee, established by the Secretary-General of the United Nations in 2017, when matters
relevant to IOM’s mandate are discussed. At the regional level, IOM is a member of the six Regional
UNDG Teams. At national level, IOM is now fully integrated in UNCTs and well positioned to work with
all stakeholders on all aspects of migration governance.

13.        Furthermore, IOM participated in a number of United Nations inter-agency networks to
improve general coordination and exchange good practices. These networks covered areas such as
security, legal matters, internal audits, evaluation, strategic planning, human resources, finance and
budget, information and communications technology, procurement and humanitarian financing.

14.       Other benefits and efficiencies likely to be gained from entering the United Nations system
include: access to additional funding sources, such as multi-donor trust funds; increased ease of travel
and security of staff movement once the United Nations laissez-passer are issued; streamlined inter-
agency arrangements relating to procurement and programming, through contribution agreements;
and tax exemptions in line with improved privileges and immunities.

                                                                                              C/109/4
                                                                                               Page 5


15.       At the same time, IOM’s integration in the United Nations system has cost implications,
including cost-sharing fees related to membership in the Chief Executives Board and the UNDG. Thus
far, the budget increase approved by the Council in Resolution No. 1318 of 30 June 2016 has proven
sufficient to cover these central costs. At the field level, there are also costs related to IOM
engagement in the Regional UNDG Teams and cost-sharing arrangements for UNCTs/UNDAFs and local
cost-shared budgets for security. These costs are being covered from other funding sources, mostly
through projectization.

16.       In his report, Making migration work for all, the Secretary-General of the United Nations
referred to the need to address the United Nations fragmented policy responses to migration, both in
the immediate context of the global compact and in the wider context of the SDGs. IOM is currently
assessing the implications of the United Nations reforms – in particular the proposal to strengthen the
position of Resident Coordinators within the UNCTs and the resulting dual reporting lines for
IOM Chiefs of Mission – the calls for increased harmonization of back-office functions, and the
proposed criteria for agency presence in-country.

17.       More information on partnerships with the United Nations and IOM’s role within the IASC
structure is provided under the “Principle 3” section.

Sustainable Development Goals and Migration Governance Framework

18.       When adopting the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the United Nations Member
States for the first time recognized migration as being directly relevant to the achievement of global
development goals. In 2017, 102 IOM offices supported governments in the implementation of
migration aspects of the SDGs. For the most part, such activities are conducted in partnership with
other United Nations agencies. For instance, roughly 60 per cent of IOM’s SDG-related work has been
implemented in the context of UNDAF.

-----------------------Page 11 End-----------------------

19.       Given the specific commitment in SDG target 10.7 to facilitate safe, orderly, regular and
responsible migration, including through planned and well-managed migration policies, IOM’s ability
to translate its experience (especially from the field) into policy recommendations and expert advice
is an essential part of the Organization’s mission.

20.       At the Council in 2015, IOM Member States welcomed a definition of “well-managed
migration policies” through its endorsement of MiGOF. Subsequently, the United Nations General
Assembly adopted (through resolution 71/313 of 10 July 2017) the framework of indicators developed
by the Inter-Agency and Expert Group on Sustainable Development Goal Indicators. Indicator 10.7.2
(Number of countries that have implemented well-managed migration policies) uses the MiGOF
principles and objectives.

21.       At the national level, countries may wish to address cross-cutting issues, such as migration,
in more depth. For this purpose, IOM, in partnership with the Economist Intelligence Unit, developed
the Migration Governance Indicators. The MGI process provides a tool for governments to assess the
comprehensiveness of their migration policies and to help them identify gaps and priorities to build
institutional capacity, legislation and programmes on migration. It aims to advance migration
governance by translating the term “well-governed migration” into an operational reality in the
context of SDG target 10.7. It also plays an essential role in offering insights into areas where
policymakers can strengthen migration governance in their countries and make progress towards
achieving the migration-related SDGs. Thirty-nine countries have been included in the MGI process
and, in 2017, interministerial consultations to discuss MGI results were organized in 12 countries.
Among various future initiatives, there are plans to adapt the MGI methodology to address the local
dimensions of migration governance and to work in closer partnership with local authorities.

PRINCIPLE 1: ADHERENCE TO INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS AND FULFILMENT OF
MIGRANTS’ RIGHTS

Supporting States’ adherence to international standards

22.      In 2017, the Organization continued to assist States in their efforts to ensure adherence to
migration-related international standards. One hundred and ten IOM offices reported having
supported States in meeting their commitments under international law during the reporting period.

23.      IOM worked with a broad spectrum of ministries and entities dealing with issues ranging
from home affairs, border management and immigration to health, women’s affairs and national
defence.

24.       In most cases, IOM advised governments on reviewing or developing legislation and policies
through consultations organized with relevant stakeholders, technical cooperation or compliance
assessments. IOM expertise was also provided through training for relevant stakeholders
(e.g. government officials in 112 countries, CSO partners in 60 countries and the private sector in
40 countries) on adherence to international standards. Some of the most common standards on which
IOM delivered training concerned trafficking and smuggling (107 and 72 countries, respectively),
labour standards (65 countries) and standards relating to entry and exit (61 countries). In addition,
IOM trained 770 people on international standards relating to migrant rights.

A principled approach in the Organization

25.      IOM is also committed to adhering to international standards in its own work, which is a pillar
of organizational effectiveness. The Organization follows a series of human rights-based, migrant-
centred principles, intrinsic to all operations and staff values. In this respect, IOM has adopted a
number of policies that have yielded the following results.

Principles for Humanitarian Action

26.      Principled humanitarian partnerships are a core institutional commitment. As part of
strengthening staff knowledge and capacity to consistently apply humanitarian principles, in 2017,
IOM designed a 75-minute training course on the IOM Principles for Humanitarian Action for all IOM
staff and selected implementing partners. The course is available in Arabic, English, French and
Spanish. The Principles have further been included in the IOM Emergency Manual, the IOM Project
Development Handbook and the forthcoming monitoring and evaluation online training. Seventy
IOM offices explicitly referenced the IOM Principles for Humanitarian Action in strategy (35 offices)
and project documents (62 offices), particularly in Asia and the Pacific and Central and West Africa.

27.      One hundred and five Country Offices and eight Regional Offices reported that they had
promoted respect for humanitarian principles (humanity, impartiality, neutrality, independence)
through capacity-building (80 offices), awareness-raising (63 offices) and coordination (53 offices).
Governments were the largest reported counterpart in these activities (in 93 countries), followed by
NGOs/civil society (66 countries), implementing partners (54 countries) and affected populations
(48 countries). IOM engaged in advocacy with 37 donors to strengthen needs-based programming and
implement commitments to principled humanitarian action/financing.

28.       Forty-one Country Offices reported that they were directly confronted with challenges to
principled humanitarian action, specifically noting access issues (25 offices), security concerns
(25 offices) and humanitarian coverage (18 offices).

29.       In line with the internal guidance note on how to mainstream protection across IOM crisis
response, 61 IOM offices confirmed that their project activities mainstreamed core protection
principles. Forty offices reported that all four protection principles – namely, prioritizing safety and
dignity and not causing harm; ensuring access to aid and services without discrimination; being
accountable to affected populations; fostering participation and empowerment – are mainstreamed.
Such activities included: conducting focus groups to ensure the specific protection needs of migrants
in vulnerable situations are addressed in transit centres; using post-distribution monitoring and
screening forms; and including the concerns expressed by internally displaced persons with disabilities
in the planning of shelter construction to ensure their meaningful access to shelter.

Gender Equality Policy 2015–2019

30.       Following the endorsement of the IOM Gender Equality Policy 2015–2019 by Member States
in 2015, the Organization stepped up its efforts to promote gender mainstreaming and gender parity
at the global level and has started to provide technical support in this area to the Regional Offices and
Country Offices.

31.       The Organization’s work on promoting gender equality produced two key achievements in
2017. First, IOM conducted a midterm evaluation of the implementation of the IOM Gender Equality
Policy 2015–2019. The evaluation determined that the Policy provided the strong foundation
necessary to strengthen IOM’s work on gender equality in its programmes and activities, and in its
staffing and organizational culture. However, more work was needed to produce lasting results
towards gender equality, especially securing women’s rights and allowing women to realize their full
potential. The success of gender equality within IOM would depend largely on the continued support
of senior management and the engagement of all staff.

32.       Second, 2017 marked the end of a five-year period during which IOM made significant
progress in the implementation of the United Nations System-wide Action Plan on Gender Equality and
the Empowerment of Women and its 15 performance indicators. From meeting only one indicator in
2012, IOM met or exceeded nine of the performance indicators at the end of 2017.

33.       Other related activities included the pilot phase of an IOM gender marker system, which rates
IOM projects to indicate the extent to which gender considerations have been taken into account.
Training on the gender marker system was held at Headquarters and in the Regional Offices in Nairobi
and Vienna. The pilot phase revealed that over 50 per cent of the projects rated had given adequate
attention to gender in their project proposal documents. These types of projects are considered likely
to make a significant contribution to gender equality. Furthermore, IOM produced a video, entitled
UN-Biased, which helps staff to identify and challenge their own biases when involved in recruitment
processes.

34.       In the field, 112 IOM offices reported that they had introduced a gender perspective in their
projects. Moreover, 7 offices implemented projects whose objective was gender equality, and another
23 offices included gender-specific components within general projects. Focusing on the long term,
the main gender-related engagement for most IOM offices was to mainstream gender in migration or
other policies, as reported by 92 offices, followed by economic and skills empowerment of a
disadvantaged or underrepresented gender, as reported by 69 offices. Sixty-eight offices also reported
working to address sexual and gender-based violence either in displacement settings, in migrant
communities, or both.

35.        With regard to IOM programming outcomes, 53 countries reported that IOM efforts had
increased employment or income among a disadvantaged gender; 44 countries reported that IOM
activities improved health outcomes for a disadvantaged gender; and 42 countries reported that IOM
efforts decreased prevalence of sexual and gender-based violence. Advancements in political

                                                                                                  Page 9


representation, school enrolment and access to justice for a disadvantaged gender are among some
of the other outcomes to which IOM programming contributed. For example, in Tajikistan, IOM
implemented a project that led to increased representation of women at different levels of the
national border forces. Similarly, in Tunisia, IOM activities helped to increase the participation and
leadership role of women in partner institutions and organizations.

36.       Offices whose main gender-related focus was addressing abuse or exploitation of migrant
workers among a specific gender reported an increased access to justice by such workers. In Ghana,
IOM partnered with the Ministry of Gender, Children and Social Protection to conduct a stakeholder
meeting for all actors involved in work with young female migrants, known as Kayayei, who work in
harsh conditions in urban markets carrying loads for traders and other customers. The meeting aimed
to raise awareness and coordinate activities to address this particularly vulnerable group of migrants.

37.       Within the Organization, some progress was made with regard to gender parity, which was
the focus of the 2016 report entitled Diversity and Inclusion within IOM. In 2017, women represented
47 per cent of the total workforce, and 46 per cent at the international Professional level (a 1% increase
compared with 2016). Furthermore, at the P-4 level, women represented 41 per cent (1% increase
compared with 2016), 36 per cent at the P-5 level (2% increase compared with 2016), and 32 per cent
at the D-1 to D-2 levels (6% increase compared with 2016) (see Annex III for more details). The
Organization will continue to track and report on these statistics.

Protection from sexual exploitation and abuse

38.       In recent years, IOM has expanded its activities on PSEA, both internally and with external
partners. Since 2011, in his capacity as IASC Champion on PSEA, the Director General has chaired
biannual meetings where the Senior Focal Points on PSEA provide institutional updates on their
implementation of the Minimum Operating Standards on PSEA. In 2017, IOM continued to be an active
member of the IASC Task Team on Accountability to Affected Populations and Protection from Sexual
Exploitation and Abuse, which promotes global-level coordination and builds the technical capacity of
in-country PSEA networks, and to liaise between the IASC and the United Nations Working Group on
PSEA, thereby promoting harmonization of the humanitarian and United Nations processes.

39.       In 2017, IOM provided technical assistance to Humanitarian Coordinators and humanitarian
country teams in seven countries (Chad, Iraq, Lebanon, Malawi, Nigeria, Turkey and Yemen) to
institutionalize PSEA measures, including inter-agency complaint mechanisms and community-based
complaint mechanisms, to prevent and respond to SEA.

40.      In the field, 33 IOM offices were part of an in-country network or task force on PSEA and IOM
co-chaired the PSEA in-country network in five countries (Bangladesh, Chad, Nicaragua, the Philippines
and Yemen). Moreover, 26 offices put in place inter-agency complaint and feedback mechanisms for
SEA or general accountability.

41.      In 2017, IOM facilitated training on PSEA for more than 3,500 staff members (approximately
1,350 female and 2,150 male staff) in 62 offices worldwide. The IOM target of providing a first response
within 48 hours to 90 per cent of SEA allegations made via the central intake system was met.

Standards of conduct

42.       All persons employed by or working for IOM must abide by the IOM Standards of Conduct
and all instructions issued by the Organization. The IOM Policy for a Respectful Working Environment
stipulates that all staff members have the right to a workplace free of harassment, which IOM has a
duty to provide. IOM also has a zero tolerance policy on SEA of beneficiaries. In 2017, the Ethics and
Conduct Office launched a mandatory e-learning module for all IOM staff members.
-----------------------Page 15 End-----------------------

Page 10


Ninety- one per cent of staff worldwide have completed the module, which includes training on
preventing SEA, fraud and corruption. In addition, 700 staff attended face-to-face training on ethics,
conduct and gender matters in 13 offices.

Accountability to affected populations

43.        In line with the IASC commitments to accountability to affected populations, the
Organization’s institutional commitments to the Grand Bargain on humanitarian financing and the
Core Humanitarian Standards on Quality and Accountability, IOM developed a framework that defines
its institutional approach to accountability to affected populations. Over 300 IOM staff and
225 members of affected populations participated in the consultation phase of this process. The
framework will be piloted in 2018.

44.       At the field level, 72 per cent of offices confirmed that beneficiaries or target populations
participate in the implementation of projects/programmes, and 69 per cent involved them in the
monitoring and evaluation of projects and programmes.

          Objective of communication for feedback between IOM offices and beneficiaries,
                                      by number of offices




Transparency and accountability

45.       In 2017, IOM established the Transparency and Accountability Working Group, which aims
to review existing ways of addressing transparency and accountability, to ensure continuous
coordination of related policy and procedural matters and to create a framework to ensure that
appropriate transparency and accountability tools are established and implemented in an effective
and efficient manner.

46.       In March 2017, IOM became a member of IATI, reconfirming its strong commitment to
transparency and accountability towards Member States, beneficiaries and the general public. During
2017, IOM also took steps to identify and initiate system and policy changes which would allow it to
report via the IATI registry by March 2018. IOM foresees that its level of reporting through the IATI
platform will be incremental, in line with the approach adopted by other United Nations agencies. The
aim is for the Organization to be ranked “Fair” on the relevant Grand Bargain monitoring dashboard
by 2019.

Environmental sustainability

47.       Recognizing that a healthy environment is conducive to the well-being and resilience of
migrants and host communities, IOM made an institutional commitment in 2017 to mainstream
environmental sustainability in its strategies and programmes and at its facilities and launched its
institutional programme on environmental sustainability. After joining the United Nations
Environment Management Group in May 2017, and in order to adhere to United Nations sustainability
standards, IOM carried out an organization-wide mapping exercise that identified over 100 IOM
projects with an environmentally sustainable component, and conducted the first greenhouse gas
inventory in line with international reporting standards at Headquarters, one Regional Office
(Southern Africa) and one Country Office (Madagascar).


PRINCIPLE 2: EVIDENCE AND WHOLE-OF-GOVERNMENT APPROACHES

Strengthening production and analysis of migration data and evidence

48.       One of IOM’s commitments is to serve Member States and the international community as
the lead reference for data and evidence on migration. To this effect, IOM endeavours to strengthen
the production and analysis of national, regional and global migration data, for both external and
internal use. In addition, IOM is committed to conducting and supporting research that informs
migration policy and practice, while contributing to the broader understanding of migration patterns
and processes.

49.       The Organization remained dedicated to enhancing knowledge on migration and produced
125 new publications in 2017. During the year, total downloads of publications on the IOM bookstore
surpassed 2.7 million. Among these was the World Migration Report 2018 and 26 papers by the
Migration Research Leaders Syndicate, which were compiled in a report, including a special issue in
support of the global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration process. Other noteworthy
publications included Fatal Journeys 3 – Improving Data on Missing Migrants and Making Mobility
Work for Adaptation to Environmental Changes: Results from the MECLEP global research.
Furthermore, the IOM Global Migration Data Analysis Centre launched the Data Bulletin: Informing a
Global Compact for Migration series summarizing existing migration data on a range of topics in order
to support discussions and follow-up activities relating to the global compact.

50.       In 2017, 114 offices published or completed studies, research papers, analyses or
assessments for external distribution, covering a wide range of topics, including, notably, counter-
trafficking, health and assistance for migrants in vulnerable situations. Furthermore, IOM research has
been widely used by external partners. For instance, the Government of Kazakhstan recently used IOM
research to develop its national migration policy; and, in Nicaragua, IOM technical documents are used
to support psychosocial reintegration processes.

51.      The IOM Migration Data Governance Policy provided the first framework to manage data
across the Organization. It established standards, accountabilities and responsibilities and aims to
ensure optimal use of migration data and information, while making sure that data are handled and
managed in a responsible, consistent, integrated and secure manner.

    Number of offices publishing research and studies for external distribution, by subject area




52.      The IOM Global Migration Data Analysis Centre launched the Migration Data Portal, the first
global portal of its kind. The Portal provides access to comprehensive statistics on international
migration and was identified as a key tool for data collection during the stocktaking phase for the
development of the global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration.

53.      The Counter-Trafficking Data Collaborative was launched – the first global data hub on
human trafficking – with data contributed by counter-trafficking organizations from around the world.
The platform includes primary, de-identified data on nearly 80,000 victims of human trafficking, of
180 nationalities exploited in 117 countries. The data relate to victims who have been assisted by IOM,
the human trafficking hotline in the United States of America operated by Polaris, and Liberty Asia’s
NGO partners.

54.       In 2017, 96 IOM offices collected migration data (through the DTM or other sources) for
external use (see more details on the DTM under the “Objective 2” section).

55.       The Organization’s expertise also benefits governments. During the year, 80 IOM offices
extended technical support to government counterparts to improve migration data capture and
analysis. Other support included: the upgrading of MIDAS 4.0 in Djibouti; encouraging data collection
and reporting through the Anti-Trafficking Task Force reporting mechanism in Indonesia; and setting
up a national database on migrants in vulnerable situations in Tunisia.

56.      In addition, IOM worked in close cooperation with academic institutions and migration
researchers. The Migration Research @Lunchtime seminars were established at Headquarters, where
experts are invited to present their work and discuss issues relevant to migration policy and practice.
Ninety-two IOM offices partnered with academic institutions on a range of activities, such as a mapping
exercise in Finland to assess the feasibility of the IOM migrant health application to support
communication between migrants and the health sector. In France, IOM was involved in migration
courses at the Universities of Sorbonne and Sciences Po.

Whole-of-government approach to migration

57.      IOM supports a whole-of-government approach to migration, given its cross-cutting nature.
Interventions are focused on building the capacity of governments to integrate migration into their
development planning processes and to ensure policy coherence.
-----------------------Page 18 End-----------------------

                                                                                              C/109/4
                                                                                              Page 13


58.       With IOM now part of the United Nations system, and with migration at the top of the
international policy agenda, the demand for robust policy advice and guidance on migration has grown
significantly. IOM’s capacity to provide that support to governments is therefore of growing
importance, and its ability to translate its vast field experience into tangible policy recommendations
is an essential part of the Organization’s mission. In 2017, IOM assessed its current capacity and
systems to provide policy advice; and scaled up the training and support provided to States on MiGOF
by using the Framework for policy assessments, review and revision.

59.      The assessment led to a clearer understanding of the Organization’s current capability and
resources, as well as the level of awareness and needs at the Headquarters, regional and field level to
address increasing demands for policy support. It also helped identify possible policy options and
changes in IOM structures and functions to effectively support Member States in the development and
implementation of migration policies.

60.       In the field, 87 offices supported the government to mainstream migration into development
or sectoral policy revision, planning or implementation. IOM’s policy support usually encompassed
capacity-building (training, development of standard operating procedures or training manuals)
(59 offices) and other forms of technical assistance (expert assessments, development of expert
recommendations) (51 offices).

61.       IOM provides governments with support to align migration laws with international
standards. In 2017, IOM supported the revision and adoption of policies and national standard
operating procedures in 35 countries. For example, in Cambodia, IOM facilitated a workshop on the
smuggling of human beings, with the participation of government officials, United Nations agencies,
NGOs and others. The workshop outcome was a draft law on the smuggling of human beings, which is
currently awaiting approval by the Government. In Guyana, the IOM project entitled Strengthening
the Capacity of Guyana to Effectively Combat Trafficking in Persons and Assist Victims of Trafficking
reviewed the country’s anti-trafficking law and policy to propose concrete recommendations, in line
with IOM’s established good practices.

Page 14


62.      The Organization is also working with the European Commission to strengthen the
mainstreaming of migration into international cooperation and development policies of the European
Union and other development partners.

63.       These mainstreaming efforts also yielded results in other fields, including labour migration
(e.g. in Sierra Leone, Togo and Zimbabwe) and health (e.g. in Kenya, Morocco and Slovenia). In
Sri Lanka, IOM’s work led to a new policy on reparations to support the development of the Immigrants
and Emigrants Act. In the Republic of Moldova, reintegration of returning migrants is the focus of a
new policy.

64.      Fifty-seven offices reported that their host government had developed a plan of action to
support the delivery of strategies or policies, and 42 offices that the plan of action was being
implemented across decentralized branches of government at the local level. In Ecuador, for instance,
IOM organized a workshop to identify a road map for establishing national–local coordination
mechanisms and for integrating migration into local government policy planning.

65.       The whole-of-government approach also includes efforts by government ministries to
achieve the migration-related aspects of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. In 2017,
102 offices provided support to governments on implementation of the 2030 Agenda and the SDGs.
This support involved working closely with other United Nations agencies and other partners. In
Albania, for example, IOM is a signatory to the Programme of Cooperation for Sustainable
Development 2017–2021 between the Government of Albania and the United Nations. In Ethiopia,
IOM supported the Government, through IGAD and the African Union, with capacity-building and
training on how migration relates to the SDGs. Lastly, in Uruguay, IOM participated in workshops
organized by the Government and UNDP.


PRINCIPLE 3: PARTNERSHIPS

66.        IOM believes that partnerships are critical for advancing good migration governance, and
that this principle applies to IOM and other international organizations, as much as to States.

Global partnerships

67.       One hundred and four IOM offices reported that they had engaged in global partnerships in
2017 (2016: 52 offices). Most engagement related to the global compact for migration (89 offices).
Seventy-nine offices reported that global partnerships helped to increase common understanding of
migration issues among participating States and to harmonize positions; 54 reported that they helped
in policy dialogue or events; and 48 that the partnerships supported the implementation and review
of migration-related SDGs.

68.       The Organization’s principal migration policy dialogue forum, the IDM, aims to increase the
understanding of migration issues among policymakers and to build capacity for effective migration
management and help harmonize positions. In 2017, the two IDM workshops – the first, held in
New York, the second in Geneva – were dedicated to the global compact for safe, orderly and regular
migration. This was in response to the invitation of the United Nations General Assembly, in resolution
71/280 of 6 April 2017, for its Member States to use global mechanisms and processes, including the
IDM, to contribute to the global compact process. Over 700 participants representing all relevant
actors in the global compact process participated in the two IDM events, held in April and July. The
discussions of the two workshops were consolidated in the IDM Red Book No. 27, which was presented
as a contribution to the stocktaking meeting, held in Puerto Vallarta, and shared widely to support the
global compact process. In 2017, IOM also produced the IDM Red Book No. 26, which contained the
outcome of discussions of the IDM in 2016, which had addressed follow-up and review of migration in
the SDGs.
-----------------------Page 20 End-----------------------

                                                                                                  C/109/4
                                                                                                  Page 15


69.       The IDM also serves as a platform for developing ideas for migration policies. The
participation in the 2017 IDM of high-level representatives contributed to the review of national
migration policies and to the implementation of new policy initiatives. For instance, the participation
of the Chief of the State Migration Service of Azerbaijan contributed to the development of the
country’s five-year migration management strategy. The strategy will be aligned with MiGOF, the SDGs
and the international commitments of Azerbaijan. Following the participation of the Director of the
Immigration Department and the Chair of the National Migration Coordination Mechanism of Kenya,
the Government, with IOM support, produced a final draft of the National Migration Policy. The
participation of the State Secretary for Equality and Citizenship of Portugal in the 2016 IDM led to the
implementation by the Government of the MGI in 2017, which is likely to influence the review of the
national migration strategy. Similarly, in Cabo Verde, the Government drafted the National Strategic
Plan for Sustainable Development for the next five years in line with the SDGs.

               Number of IOM offices contributing to global partnerships, by process




Regional and interregional partnerships

70.        Regional and interregional bodies and forums are vital actors in improving international
migration governance. Inter-State consultation mechanisms on migration are State-led, ongoing
information-sharing and policy dialogues for those States with an interest in promoting cooperation in
the field of migration. They may be officially associated with formal regional institutions, or be informal
and non-binding, and their geographical scope can be regional (i.e. RCPs) or interregional
(i.e. interregional forums on migration).

71.       IOM support to inter-State consultation mechanisms on migration includes: technical
expertise, policy guidance, research, capacity-building and targeted project initiatives. IOM is a
member of the Bali Process on People Smuggling, Trafficking in Persons and Related Transnational
Crime, and participates in, and provides administrative support to, the Intergovernmental
Consultations on Migration, Asylum and Refugees. The Organization is also an observer to 16 inter-
State consultation mechanisms on migration, serves as a technical secretariat to 9 (upon the request
of the participating governments) and for 5 manages secretariat support projects.
-----------------------Page 21 End-----------------------

Page 16


Regional consultative processes on migration

72.      In 2017, 42 per cent of IOM offices were engaged in RCPs. The three most common types of
engagement by IOM offices in 2017 were facilitation of meetings, technical advice, and attendance at
meetings or events. IOM staff also provided significant support in building the capacities of RCPs,
providing technical secretariat support, and contributing to data collection, analysis and sharing.

73.       Some offices contributed to or produced publications related to their engagements during
the reporting period. In Nigeria, under the Migration Dialogue for West Africa, the office produced a
study entitled Regional Policies and Response to Manage Pastoral Movements within the ECOWAS
Region. In Costa Rica, the Regional Conference on Migration produced the Regional Guidelines for the
Comprehensive Protection of Boys, Girls and Adolescents in the Context of Migration.

74.       With regard to engagement in RCPs, 48 offices reported an increase in common
understanding of migration issues among participating States and the harmonization of positions
across their region. Twenty-five offices mentioned the establishment of national focal points, national
offices, working groups or other institutional set-ups relating to RCPs.


                     Number of offices engaged in regional consultative processes,
                                        by type of engagement




Interregional forums on migration

75.       Twenty-five per cent of IOM offices engaged in interregional forums on migration. Twelve
offices supported the Pan-African Forum on Migration, held in Kampala, Uganda, and eight offices
supported the EU-Horn of Africa Migration Route Initiative (Khartoum Process). IOM offices in the
region took an active part in Bali Process meetings. IOM also contributed to the fifth meeting of the
Ibero-American Network of Migration Authorities (RIAM), held in Panama, and to the report of the
Abu Dhabi Dialogue special workshop, held in Dubai.

76.      Once more, IOM’s most common form of engagement in these forums was to facilitate
meetings and to provide technical advice and capacity-building. For example, IOM, through its
collaboration with the Regional Support Office of the Bali Process, developed and piloted the Bali
Process training curriculum entitled Comprehensive Approaches for Addressing Irregular Movement
by Sea, aimed at senior-level government officials. In Egypt, IOM’s engagement with interregional
forums on migration resulted in further promotion of the global compact for migration process and
open discussion with the government.

77.      The Organization’s support to regional inter-State consultation mechanisms in 2017 led to an
increase in common understanding of migration issues among participating States and a
harmonization of positions across regions.

78.      Forty-seven offices were engaged in multilateral and cross-regional initiatives, such as those
led by the European Union, the African Union, the Organization of American States, the Eurasian
Economic Commission, the Council of the Baltic Sea States and the Specific Action Programme of the
European Reintegration Network. Furthermore, enhanced collaboration was reported with ASEAN
across various sectors in support of the ASEAN Community Vision 2025 and the SDGs.

Partnerships with other agencies

79.      IOM is a full and active member at all levels of the IASC structure, including the IASC Principals
meetings, the Emergency Directors Group, the Working Group and its subsidiary bodies (task teams
and reference groups). The Director General is the IASC Champion on PSEA and works with senior
leadership from IASC participating agencies (including key United Nations and other humanitarian
partners) to implement PSEA standards and international commitments on the issue. As the Global
CCCM Cluster co-lead, IOM is also part of the Global Cluster Coordinators Group, chaired by OCHA, and
works with other cluster coordinators as part of several work streams under this Group.

80.      IOM joined the Global WASH Cluster in 2017 and continued to lead the inter-agency Global
Solar and Water Initiative. The Organization also assumed the chairmanship of the Inter-Agency
Working Group on Unaccompanied and Separated Children.

81.       In its efforts to reduce the risks of gender-based violence in emergency settings, IOM
partners with clusters and agencies, including the Global CCCM Cluster members, the Global Shelter
Cluster, the Gender-based Violence Area of Responsibility, the Women’s Refugee Commission,
CARE International UK and the Norwegian Refugee Council.

82.       The Organization also continued its active participation in the Inter-Agency Working Group
on Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration, including efforts under way to update the
relevant standards and provide guidance on disarmament, demobilization and reintegration processes
in contexts of ongoing or protracted conflict and violent extremism.

83.      IOM is a member of the Global Protection Cluster. In 2017, partnerships on protection were
strengthened with other United Nations agencies, including UNICEF, the United Nations Population
Fund and UNHCR, with peacekeeping operations, international and national NGOs and local
municipalities.

84.      In 2017, as part of the United Nations efforts to promote the New Way of Working initiative,
IOM, as one of the largest United Nations actors in terms of humanitarian and development
programming, was selected to participate in the newly formed Joint Steering Committee to advance
humanitarian and development collaboration, chaired by the Deputy Secretary-General of the United
Nations.

85.      Consolidating its role as a key operational actor in disaster risk reduction, the Organization
became an observer member to the Capacity for Disaster Reduction Initiative, a global partnership
composed of 15 United Nations agencies and other organizations that works towards strengthening
countries’ capacities to prevent, manage and recover from disasters.

86.       During the year, IOM continued to take an active role in the Inter-Agency Coordination Group
against Trafficking in persons and took the lead in producing the Issue Brief on Trafficking in Persons
in Humanitarian Crises. In September, the Group also supported the appraisal of the United Nations
-----------------------Page 23 End-----------------------

Global Plan of Action to Combat Trafficking in Persons, which resulted in the adoption by the General
Assembly of the Political declaration on the implementation of the United Nations Global Plan of
Action to Combat Trafficking in Persons.

87.       The Organization also participated in the establishment of Alliance 8.7, a global partnership
that aims to assist United Nations Member States to achieve SDG target 8.7: “Take immediate and
effective measures to eradicate forced labour, end modern slavery and human trafficking and secure
the prohibition and elimination of the worst forms of child labour, including recruitment and use of
child soldiers, and by 2025 end child labour in all its forms”. IOM is leading the Alliance 8.7 action group
on migration, and co-leading the action group on conflict and humanitarian settings, together with
UNICEF and UNHCR.

88.      At the national level, IOM is fully integrated into all existing UNCTs where IOM is present. In
2017, IOM participated in 34 inter-agency humanitarian plans and also participated in United Nations
development assistance plans and frameworks across the world. The Organization provided guidance
to UNCT partners on the critical importance of mainstreaming migration and displacement issues into
national development plans and frameworks. The Global Migration Group Working Group on
Mainstreaming Migration into National Development Strategies, co-chaired by IOM and UNDP, is an
example of this support. In 2017, the Working Group produced the Guidance Note: Integrating
Migration and Displacement in United Nations Development Assistance Frameworks.

89.       IOM is also participating in a number of joint programmes, such as the United Nations Kigoma
Joint Programme, in the United Republic of Tanzania, which was launched in 2017.

90.      The Organization continued to forge strong bilateral partnerships with other United Nations
agencies and international actors, in fields such as emergency response, health, migration data,
refugee resettlement, migration and the environment, labour migration, child protection, trade,
economic development and border management.

91.       A new memorandum of understanding was signed with UNAIDS. IOM continues to review
existing cooperation agreements and to seek the establishment of new ones with other agencies.

National and local governments

92.     Migration presents opportunities and challenges that are addressed by a wide range of
government ministries. IOM partners with national and local authorities to build their capacities and
improve overall migration governance.

93.       At the national level, the most common government institutions engaging with IOM are
those dealing with immigration or migration (as reported by 127 IOM offices), foreign, international or
consular affairs (114 offices), interior or home affairs (104 offices) and border management
(99 offices). In 2017, 22 new partnerships were established to assist States with their migration
management policies and systems to implement well-administered visa and entry schemes. Another
18 new partnerships were established to assist governments in support of complementary pathways
for regular migration (family reunification, student and humanitarian visa schemes), and seven new
agreements were signed to facilitate the verification of visa-related documentation.

94.       In 124 countries, IOM also supported cities and other local and regional authorities’ efforts
to enhance migration governance for development and humanitarian response at the local level. This
included support for social cohesion, engagement with diaspora, mainstreaming migration into local
development planning, enhancing partnerships with civil society actors and promoting sustainable
livelihoods. For instance, in Serbia, capacities at the local level were strengthened through training on
migration and development, and, in the Philippines, a high-level conference on reintegration was held
-----------------------Page 24 End-----------------------

                                                                                                C/109/4
                                                                                                Page 19


to promote good practices. IOM also worked with municipalities in the United Kingdom and Norway
to support the integration of newly resettled refugees and to enhance understanding in communities.

95.       In 2017, IOM helped foster the policymaking role and capacity of cities and facilitated their
input to international policy developments; for example, the Mechelen Declaration, which was the
outcome document of the Global Conference on Cities and Migration, held in Belgium in November.
The Declaration was submitted as input to the global compact for migration and the New Urban
Agenda. IOM also supported subnational dialogue on migration issues through the annual Global
Mayoral Forum on Migration and Development.

Civil society

96.      As migration governance approaches have evolved, the Organization’s activities and
partnerships with civil society have expanded, including in the areas of: research; awareness-raising;
advocacy; training and national capacity enhancement; migration assistance, including protection and
assistance for migrants in vulnerable situations and assisted voluntary return and reintegration;
health-care provision and other forms of service delivery in humanitarian, early recovery and
development settings. In addition to partnerships in joint projects (where IOM implements projects on
behalf of CSOs as donors 1), IOM also interacts with civil society in the areas of advocacy, policy
guidance, development and implementation.

97.       In 2017, IOM engaged with approximately 2,000 national and international civil society
partners or actors in its daily operational activities and on a broad range of migration-related issues.
Eighty-nine per cent of IOM offices indicated that they worked with civil society. Civil society partners
include NGOs, CSOs, migrant associations, media organizations, community-based organizations,
diaspora associations, trade unions, think tanks, advocacy groups and philanthropic foundations.

98.      Partnering with civil society has enhanced IOM project implementation and expanded
project deliverables, improved access to services and grass-roots information by local communities,
contributed to national and regional policies and strategies, and increased access to funding. Many of
these partnerships have improved civil society’s acceptance of IOM and its programmes.

99.       In the context of migration health, several civil society actors participated in the second
Global Consultation on Migrant Health, jointly organized by IOM, WHO and the Government of
Sri Lanka, to engage in cross-sectoral policy-level dialogue and enable an environment for change.

100.      For the first time in 2017 civil society representatives from Europe, Asia, the Middle East and
Africa participated in the Global Meeting of Chairs and Secretariats of Consultative Processes on
Migration, hosted by IOM. They contributed to a panel entitled Partnerships Towards the GCM and
Engagement with UN Regional Commissions, Regional Intergovernmental Organizations, Civil Society,
Private Sector and Academia.

101.      Throughout 2017, several consultations took place with civil society partners in dedicated
events on the global compact for migration with IOM’s support, namely: seven regional civil society
consultations; side events on migration and health; informal dialogues on the margins of the IDM
workshops, held in New York and Geneva; and a side event on the margins of one of the thematic
sessions held in Geneva.

102.    IOM and civil society also engaged in scenario-building, to pursue a migration dialogue
beyond the current focus on emergencies and to develop a set of plausible and thought-provoking

    In the last 10 years, IOM has received USD 85 million in funding from CSOs.

Page 20


migration scenarios for the year 2030. This initiative resulted in a publication, Tomorrow’s World of
Migration and Mobility.

103.      The annual IOM–NGO humanitarian consultations are an important platform to promote
principled humanitarian action. The 2017 consultations, co-organized with the International Council of
Voluntary Agencies, were held in September in Kenya. The consultations covered issues of mutual
interest to IOM and NGOs working in East Africa, including internal displacement and durable
solutions, mixed flows, cluster coordination and the global compact for migration. The venue for the
consultations alternates each year between IOM Headquarters and regional hubs to make the event
more accessible to local and national partners.

Private sector

104.      Seventy IOM offices reported that their work had included engagement with private sector
organizations in 2017. In many instances, partnerships with the private sector enhanced existing IOM
projects funded by traditional donors.

105.    The Organization initiated a series of engagements with the private sector in Chile, Indonesia,
Morocco, Mozambique, Poland, the Republic of Korea, the United Republic of Tanzania, Turkey and
Viet Nam. Within these projects, businesses shared know-how and resources on issues such as:
(a)       Fair and ethical recruitment of migrant workers;
(b)       Exploitation and trafficking in businesses’ own operations and supply chains;
(c)       IT skills development and the creation of livelihood opportunities for displaced persons;
(d)       Integration of migrant workers in the labour market and workplace;
(e)       Humanitarian assistance;
(f)       Health of migrant workers and local communities.

106.     These activities enhanced IOM’s visibility vis-à-vis the private sector, strengthened the
capacity of IOM offices to engage with the private sector, identified potential partners for future
collaboration, advanced the development of the CREST initiative, and created understanding and
awareness of the challenges, obstacles and solutions for displaced persons to develop and gainfully
employ IT skills.

107.    To ensure the integrity of its private sector partnerships, IOM carried out 20 partnership risk
assessments in 2017.

108.      Cognizant that the United States is the largest market for fundraising among private
individuals, IOM invested in repositioning its local, charitable partner organization USAIM, now called
“USA for IOM”. However, IOM’s partnerships with the private sector and the implementation of its
Private Sector Partnership Strategy 2016–2020 remain constrained due to funding shortfalls.

Partnerships with diaspora and transnational communities

109.     Diaspora and transnational communities have been recognized as important contributors to
the development of both their countries of origin and the countries in which they reside. These
contributions include the skills they share, the financial resources they invest and the transnational
networks they develop.

110.     IOM supports a comprehensive approach centred on “3Es for action” – engage, enable and
empower – to maximize the transnational exchange of diaspora resources. In 2017, over 70 offices
continued to harness the development role of diasporas by engaging with migrant groups,
governments or transnational communities in countries of destination and countries of origin. IOM
-----------------------Page 26 End-----------------------

                                                                                              C/109/4
                                                                                              Page 21


encouraged States to enhance communication with diasporas and to develop a diaspora engagement
policy, among other things. In Malawi, the Government requested IOM’s support in implementing a
project on diaspora community mapping and profiling. In Albania and in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the
Governments used the results of diaspora mapping exercises to develop diaspora engagement policies
and strategies.


                    Number of offices encouraging States to engage with diasporas,
                                        by type of engagement




111.      During the reporting period, 31 offices partnered directly with diaspora or transnational
communities. These partners included issue-based organizations, networks of professionals, home-
town associations and faith-based groups. The types of partnerships varied from joint implementation
of projects to collaboration on specific thematic issues or events. For instance, in the context of the
global compact for migration consultations, IOM launched the iDiaspora platform, an online forum for
diaspora communities to contribute their opinions to the intergovernmental process to develop the
global compact.

112.      During 2017, 12 offices engaged with diasporas so that they could deploy their expertise in
post-crisis settings. This engagement was primarily through enhanced innovation, good governance
and redressing sectoral shortages (e.g. in health or education) through skills transfer or temporary
return of qualified nationals programmes. For example, the Burundian diaspora was engaged in
training psychiatric nurses to support the country’s sole psychiatric doctor, enabling more Burundians
to access mental health care. In Sierra Leone, 20 health experts from the diaspora worked in the
country for short periods to support health service delivery and skills transfer.


OBJECTIVE 1: SOCIOECONOMIC WELL-BEING OF MIGRANTS AND SOCIETY

Example of a comprehensive approach: European Union Emergency Trust Fund for Africa

113.     With 27 projects worth EUR 265 million in the Sahel and Lake Chad regions, North Africa and
the Horn of Africa, IOM is a significant partner in the EUTF, which was established in November 2015
to address the root causes of destabilization, forced displacement and irregular migration.

114.       The Organization’s work with the EUTF is mainly channelled through the EU–IOM Joint
Initiative for Migrant Protection and Reintegration. Based on joint efforts between the European
Union, IOM and its African and European Member States, these projects provide life-saving assistance
to migrants along migration routes, contribute to enhancing migrant protection, and support an
integrated approach to sustainable reintegration. They also promote better migration governance and
informed migration in more than 20 countries covered by the projects.
-----------------------Page 27 End-----------------------

C/109/4
Page 22


115.      Preliminary results of the IOM–EUTF projects include the following:
(a)       In 2017, more than 3,400 stranded migrants were saved in search and rescue operations in
          the Niger.
(b)       The establishment of five new protection and assistance centres was initiated in Mali and
          Burkina Faso and continued support was provided to five existing centres in the Niger.
(c)       Over 19,000 migrants (about 75% from detention) were voluntarily returned from Libya.
(d)       More than 5,000 migrants received assistance for their voluntary return from Mali,
          Mauritania, the Niger and countries in the Horn of Africa covered by the Joint Initiative.
(e)       More than 20,500 returnees received post-arrival and reception assistance.
(f)       Nineteen flow monitoring points have been set up to collect and analyse data and publish
          reports.
(g)       A framework of standard operating procedures for assisted voluntary return and
          reintegration has been developed and is being adapted to national contexts through a
          consultative process.
(h)       Community stabilization activities in Libya have contributed to the increase in livelihood
          opportunities for Libyans and migrants and the strengthening of social cohesion.

Safe, ethical and beneficial labour migration

116.     IOM policy assistance in the area of labour mobility facilitation focuses on supporting
governments to improve labour migration frameworks and practices, and on working with both
governments and the private sector to implement and promote professional, transparent and efficient
recruitment systems based on high ethical standards and the employer pays principle.

117.      In 2017, 49 per cent of IOM offices supported governments to develop or improve labour
migration frameworks and practices. This included: the development of policies and legislation in
41 countries; improving the availability of data on labour migration in 37 countries; and assisting in
rationalizing institutional structures in 32 countries. In Uruguay, for example, IOM helped set up a
labour migration unit within the Ministry of Labour. A binational scheme was developed to facilitate
temporary labour migration from Guatemala to Mexico. In Namibia, IOM helped develop the first
national labour migration policy and implementation plan. IOM also supported the development of a
memorandum of understanding on labour migration between Zimbabwe and South Africa, and
contributed to a comparative study to harmonize policies on cross-border trade and labour in Burundi,
Kenya, Rwanda and the United Republic of Tanzania.

118.      To support these efforts, IOM has built the capacity of and provided technical assistance to
1,800 officials from ministries of labour, employment or social protection, labour inspectorates, public
employment services and local institutions. For example, in Turkey, new staff recruited by the
Directorate General for International Labour, which deals not only with the integration of foreigners
in the Turkish labour market but also with attracting highly skilled workers from other countries, were
provided with training.

119.      IOM provides policy expertise to a range of stakeholders on ethical recruitment. Forty offices
reported that they had worked with governments, the private sector and CSOs to raise awareness and
support them in the development of standards and practices that respect migrants’ rights. For
instance, in Sri Lanka, IOM helped develop standard operating procedures for ethical recruitment in
the labour migration sector and a training curriculum for recruitment agents. The Organization has
also assessed labour supply chains in seven countries.

120.    IRIS is an important component of the Organization’s work on ethical recruitment. In 2017,
IOM engaged in advocacy and awareness-raising in 39 countries to promote IRIS as a practical tool for
governments, businesses and workers. At the global level, IOM also developed partnerships with
-----------------------Page 28 End-----------------------

                                                                                              C/109/4
                                                                                              Page 23


multinational companies and business industry initiatives as part of its work on IRIS, such as the
Responsible Business Alliance and the Consumer Goods Forum.

Promoting social, economic and cultural inclusion of migrants

121.       The Organization is committed to promoting the social, economic and cultural inclusion of
migrants by reinforcing a two-way integration process, which is essential for the existence of thriving
multicultural communities. By helping migrants to better integrate into new communities and by
building the capacity of local authorities to receive new populations, highlighting the positive
contributions that migrants can make, IOM fostered social cohesion, diversity and tolerance. In 2017,
117 offices were engaged in promoting integration and the social, economic and cultural inclusion of
migrants in host countries. Eighty-nine offices provided direct support to migrants in the areas shown
in the following graphic.

122.      National authorities, CSOs and the private sector are IOM’s key stakeholders with regard to
migrant integration and social cohesion activities. In 2017, IOM built the capacity of national and local
authorities (in 71 countries), CSOs (in 54 countries) and the private sector (in 18 countries) in
integration matters.


           Number of offices engaged in promoting integration and inclusion of migrants,
                                     by type of engagement




123.      During 2017, the Organization’s work to promote migrant inclusion in host communities took
many shapes. In Turkey, for example, IOM worked closely with the Directorate General for Migration
Management and the Association of Local Authorities to establish migrant resource centres to cater
for the multifaceted needs of the migrant population – mostly Syrians under temporary protection,
but also people from all over the world (189 nationalities).

124.       In Austria, Italy, Poland and Romania, IOM was engaged in building the capacity of
14 municipalities to better cater for third-country nationals residing in their community. IOM training
reached about 320 people (e.g. social workers, staff at migrant reception centres, municipal police
officers), who now have a better understanding of migration and increased intercultural competences
within local services. Training was followed by peer visits that allowed each municipality to learn how
other cities manage social services for their increasingly diverse populations.

125.     IOM has been promoting information exchange and access to tools in a number of European
countries to help authorities and employers better coordinate recognition of the skills of refugees and
asylum seekers. The Organization’s activities connected thousands of refugees, employers, migrant
groups and local authorities and made progress towards integrating beneficiaries of international
protection in the European Union into the labour market.

126.      IOM continued to actively promote migrants’ economic and financial well-being. Forty-eight
offices directly helped to improve the economic situation of over 19,500 migrants. Activities focused
on improving financial literacy, knowledge on remittances, access to additional finance
(e.g. microcredit) and working with financial providers to increase the availability of financial services
and products to migrant households. For example, in Cambodia, IOM economic empowerment
counsellors helped to enhance refugees’ business knowledge and planning. In Iraq, IOM provided Iraqis

                                                                                                C/109/4
                                                                                                Page 25


in vulnerable situations with opportunities for sustainable income generation to increase their
employability based on local market demand. The Organization also supported migrant households
through its activities to benefit small businesses. Over 6,640 small businesses were assisted in 2017.

External communications and public perception

127.      Overall, 135 offices reported that IOM appeared in print or broadcast media at least once in
their country in 2017. One of the key stories that IOM brought to the world’s attention was the Libyan
“slave market” story, which came to light in April. The story was later covered by CNN, which increased
public attention to the plight of migrants.

128.     The Organization was equally active on social media, with the IOM global footprint steadily
growing. As part of the IOM Social Media Strategy, senior management were encouraged to use social
media to communicate key institutional messages. A total of 94 million users were reached across the
main social media platforms used by IOM. This exposure reinforces the role of the Organization as the
“UN migration agency”.

129.      Concerning global events, three examples demonstrate IOM’s impact: the Global Migration
Film Festival, International Migrants Day activities and the “i am a migrant” campaign exhibition in
Paris.

130.     The film festival is an annual event that seeks to stimulate conversations about migration. In
2017, 100 IOM offices participated in the festival and more than 27,000 people attended
345 screenings. On social media, the festival reached 25 million people. The festival caravan covered
more than 3,000 km through popular desert migrant routes in the Niger screening films to
communities affected by migration.

131.      On 18 December, International Migrants Day was celebrated by all IOM offices. The highlight
of celebrations in 2017 was the Together in New York initiative for which IOM and UNICEF co-hosted
a series of events under the Together – Respect, Safety and Dignity for All campaign which focused on
the crucial role of the arts in creating understanding and dialogue about migration.

132.      The “i am a migrant” campaign enables migrants of all backgrounds to share their stories and
describe the various stages of their migratory journeys. In 2017, IOM collaborated with the city of Paris
by holding a campaign exhibition of 18 migrant profiles. Similar exhibitions were held in other cities,
such as Bangkok, Brussels and Lisbon.

133.      The IOM Brand Guidelines were developed and include a new IOM visibility logo designed to
make IOM more prominent. The visibility logo is also consistent with the standards of other
international organizations.

134.     IOM continued its work to improve the public perception of migrants in 2017, with
62 countries having carried out information campaigns. In West Africa, the Aware Migrants campaign
raised awareness about the dangers of irregular migration, using the testimonies of returning migrants.
The campaign messaging was disseminated via radio, social media and community events, and its
impact was measured using the IOM Community Response Map. Additionally, local artists from nine
West African countries came together to produce an awareness-raising song that reached over
25,000 viewers. As part of the SPEAK project, IOM helped to shape a better and more balanced
understanding of voluntary return and reintegration, through the production of information materials
and visual storytelling, allowing migrants to speak about their experiences and achievements and the
challenges encountered throughout their journeys.
-----------------------Page 31 End-----------------------

C/109/4

135.      In Austria, IOM empowered municipal front-line workers and volunteers to help confront
prejudice in local communities. In the Gambia, IOM shared the experiences of nationals recently
repatriated from Libya and Europe with local media, changing perceptions of the risks of irregular
migration. In Kazakhstan, in cooperation with local actors, IOM produced a campaign reaching
38,000 persons promoting a positive image of migration in general.

136.     In the Lao People’s Democratic Republic, IOM hosted a mini-marathon for International
Migrants Day to raise awareness on safe migration and its productive impact regarding skills transfer,
remittances, education and training.

137.      In the Philippines, IOM continued to encourage safe migration and public action to stop
human trafficking and exploitation through its IOM X campaign aimed at a target population of
189 million people. During the year, the campaign produced 34 videos, including music videos and a
drama series, and 10 workshops were organized to build capacity among nearly 200 partners.

138.      In Sierra Leone, an interactive radio broadcast was organized for the smooth integration of
returning migrants. Most calls received during the radio show reflected an understanding of the
situation of the migrant returnees and appealed for others to support their reintegration. In the
United Kingdom, IOM organized information sessions to enable local authorities and community
sponsors to better understand the refugee communities they are welcoming. Also in the
United Kingdom, through the Portraits of Welcome and Building Tomorrow Together projects, IOM
also contributed to community cohesion activities. Such activities enhance the integration prospects
of returnees or refugees and have a positive impact on public perception.

139.     Also in 2017, the TOGETHER App multimedia platform was launched to encourage
engagement in the United Nations Together – Respect, Safety and Dignity for All campaign. Users can
contribute their stories to promote diversity and the inclusion of migrants in communities across the
globe.

Facilitating cost-effective remittances in support of development

140.     Another important policy area for IOM is remittances, which contribute to the economic well-
being of migrants and act as a development catalyst in home countries. In 13 countries, IOM activities
focused on working with the government and other stakeholders to advocate for reducing remittance
costs; improving market transparency; and supporting innovative schemes aimed at reducing costs.
The Organization also developed practical tools to inform migrants about remittance costs and
investment opportunities.

141.      MigApp – IOM’s application for mobile devices which was launched in December – contains
a section on remittances which provides a real-time comparison of remittance costs along specific
migration corridors. In Burundi, through an innovative partnership with UPU, IOM helped to connect
local post offices to the UPU International Financial System, hence broadening outreach to rural
communities and opening new opportunities for domestic market transfers. Through the ACP-EU
Migration Action programme, IOM supported a local NGO in the Abudwak region of Somalia to
organize a seminar for around one hundred women to encourage the sustainable investment of
remittances. The NGO also developed training tools on financial literacy and entrepreneurship and will
replicate the project in other regions.

                                                                                                Page 27


Tackling human trafficking, migrant exploitation and abuse

142.      IOM has been protecting and assisting migrants in vulnerable situations for decades,
including migrants vulnerable to violence, abuse and exploitation, such as victims of trafficking. In
2017, 143 offices worked in this area, with the main activities being direct assistance, technical
assistance, prevention – mostly through information campaigns – and research. During the year,
133 offices carried out dedicated anti-trafficking programming, and 80 offices implemented
programmes and projects specifically aimed at protecting and assisting migrant children, including
unaccompanied and separated children.

143.     Seventy-seven offices provided protection and assistance to over 90,000 migrants in
vulnerable situations. An additional 8,700 victims of trafficking were assisted by 100 offices, in
cooperation with government and NGO partners. IOM provides assistance such as safe
accommodation, medical and psychosocial support, legal aid, and assisted voluntary return and
reintegration. The IOM Global Assistance Fund provided individualized assistance to 300 migrants who
had been exploited or trafficked.

144.      In 2017, 108 offices provided training and technical assistance to 31,300 government, CSO
and private sector partners and community leaders to strengthen the protection of migrants in
vulnerable situations, including victims of trafficking and associated forms of exploitation and abuse.
For example, in Argentina IOM continued to work with the Executive Committee to Combat Human
Trafficking and Exploitation and Protect and Assist Victims to support the development of a national
plan, to be launched in 2018. In Cambodia, IOM published the Self-monitoring and Evaluation Checklist
for Private Recruitment Agencies to ensure compliance with international standards and national laws
on trafficking in persons. In the Horn of Africa, IOM further developed the capacity of migrant response
centres, operated by government authorities, IOM and other partners, to assist migrants in vulnerable
situations, including victims of trafficking. IOM also trained law enforcement agents in Zimbabwe,
foster carers in the United Kingdom, labour inspectors in Morocco, and border guards in Poland.

145.       The technical assistance and training provided by IOM enable government officials and other
stakeholders to better identify migrants in vulnerable situations, including potential and actual victims
of trafficking, and to provide them with adequate protection and assistance, including through referral
mechanisms. In Finland, for instance, IOM produced guidelines to facilitate the early identification and
referral of trafficking victims. In Estonia, it improved national referral mechanisms among governments
and CSOs for the enhanced protection of foreign victims. In the Niger, the Organization signed a
memorandum of understanding with the National Agency Against Human Trafficking to develop
technical assistance, prevention and protection activities.

146.      Information campaigns to raise awareness of and prevent trafficking continued in 2017. For
example, in Colombia, IOM supported a campaign entitled Ante La Trata No Se Haga to prevent
indifference to human trafficking and a series of awareness-raising activities targeting at-risk
Colombian youth. In the Asia and Pacific region, roll-out of the IOM X campaign continued.

147.      The Organization also continued to work with private sector entities to mitigate and address
the risk of trafficking and exploitation in their operations and supply chains, including through the
delivery of training (via the CREST programme), and to provide advisory services to multinational
companies.

Migration and health

148.      The IOM vision of “healthy migrants in healthy communities” is centred on four key
approaches: (a) promoting migrants’ right to health; (b) maintaining good public health outcomes (for
individuals and communities); (c) contributing to the positive health and development outcomes of
migration (in countries of origin, transit and destination); and (d) reducing health inequities.

149.      One hundred and eleven IOM offices reported that they had been actively engaged in
migration health-related activities during 2017. Out of these, 83 stated that the government made
efforts to ensure access to migrant-sensitive health services for all migrants without discrimination.
Moreover, 43 offices mentioned that the host government included data on migrant health in national
surveys and statistics, and 48 indicated that the government had a migration health focal point to
coordinate migration health issues among various arms of the government.

150.      During the year, 79 offices built the capacity of governments and partners on migration
health, including mental health. Capacity-building activities included border health management
training in Albania, the Congo and Senegal; development of migrant-sensitive policies, strategies and
programmes in Kenya, Myanmar and Uganda; new urbanization, health and social integration in China;
and early detection of tuberculosis among high-risk groups in Colombia, Jordan and Timor-Leste.
Furthermore, IOM chaired and participated in two WHO migration and health webinars focused on
mental health, held in September and October. In 42 countries, training targeted health professionals;
in 22, it was aimed at non-health professionals, for example border officials in Kenya and health
volunteers and military staff in the Lao People’s Democratic Republic.

151.      Out of the 83 offices involved in advocacy for migrant-sensitive health services with
governments and relevant partners, 54 targeted health professionals and 28 targeted non-health
professionals; for example, legislators and policymakers in Botswana, and police officers, social service
workers and sex workers in Mozambique. In Uganda, IOM built the capacity of health providers to
provide migrant-sensitive services to long-distance lorry drivers, sex workers and fishing communities
(e.g. HIV counselling and testing services, referrals and health education). In 2017, IOM programmes
which included sexual and reproductive health activities grew by 10 per cent compared with the
previous year. IOM also participated, delivering a keynote address, in the European Social Network
seminar entitled Migrant children and young people: Social inclusion and transition to adulthood, held
in Stockholm, Sweden, in October.

152.       The Organization’s expertise in migration-related health issues spans a broad range of
activities. For instance, during the reporting period, 65 offices were involved in awareness-raising
activities on migration and health among migrants and local communities, and over 40 carried out
vaccination activities. Furthermore, 75 offices provided direct health services to migrants and local
communities. IOM participated in and provided thematic expertise for the first WHO Summer School
on Refugee and Migrant Health, under the theme of “Managing the public health aspects of
migration”, held in Syracuse, Italy. In countries such as Guyana, Lesotho, Malawi and Myanmar, IOM
activities involved providing services and raising awareness relating to HIV. In Burundi, the Central
African Republic, Chad, Colombia, Ecuador, Libya, Morocco, the Niger, Thailand and Turkey, IOM
supported migrant and host communities with mental health and psychosocial support activities. In
Kazakhstan, migrants in vulnerable situations with tuberculosis received support. In Paraguay, IOM
monitored and responded to epidemic outbreaks such as malaria. Furthermore, in Bosnia and
Herzegovina, IOM and Swedish medical teams worked in coordination to perform surgery and medical
examinations on local populations.

Migration, the environment and climate change

153.      IOM seeks to promote stronger coherence between policies and practices related to
migration, the environment and climate change through: (a) the integration of human mobility
considerations in climate change, sustainable development and disaster risk reduction policies and
strategies; and (b) the inclusion of environmental and climate change concerns in migration policies.
In 2017, the Organization continued to expand its work on migration, the environment and climate
change at global, regional and national levels, through supporting policy development and dialogue,
which included a high-level panel at the IOM Council, building capacities of policymakers, and through
a number of new projects and initiatives.

154.     In 2017, 50 offices addressed the migration–environment–climate change nexus through a
range of awareness-raising activities; building evidence through research and data collection;
supporting States by building capacities; and participating in national policy dialogue and events linking
migration with environmental issues with the aim of integrating or developing policies to address
environmental migration.

        Number of offices engaged in migration, environment and climate change activities,
                                      by nature of activity




155.      IOM provided technical assistance to governments and other relevant stakeholders on the
migration–environment nexus. During the reporting period, the Organization trained about
250 people, mainly government officials, in eight countries on migration and environmental issues in
order to support policy development and policy coherence. The capacity-building activities were
mainly conducted using the IOM Migration, Environment and Climate Change: Training Manual. Other
training used guidelines and tools developed at national level.

156.     Awareness-raising activities were carried out at the national level in countries ranging from
Czechia, Ecuador, Fiji, Namibia and Pakistan, at various IOM-led or external events dedicated to the
environment–migration nexus. These activities reached policymakers, practitioners, academia and
students and also demonstrated IOM’s commitment to address the challenges related to migration,
-----------------------Page 35 End-----------------------

Page 30


environment and climate change issues. Internal capacities were also built through a regional
workshop in Southern Africa for IOM staff. Offices also engaged in research and data collection, which
resulted in 18 new publications in 2017.

157.      The three main activities in which IOM offices were engaged – namely, awareness-raising,
research and data, and capacity-building – resulted in new evidence to support policy discussions, the
drafting of policy frameworks or action plans, the inclusion of migration in environmental policies and
the integration of environmental factors in migration policies and plans.

158.      At the global policy level, IOM promoted the inclusion of human mobility concerns in key
policy agendas and processes, and provided technical support to UNFCCC, advancing on the work of
the Task Force on Displacement. IOM also supported the implementation of the workplan of the
Platform on Disaster Displacement; provided technical support to States for the insertion of migration
in the Human Rights Council resolution on human rights and climate change (resolution 35/20 of June
2017), and on a decision concerning desertification and drought as one of the drivers of migration,
adopted by the Thirteenth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Convention to Combat
Desertification (decision 28/COP.13 of 15 September 2017); and spearheaded efforts towards the
inclusion of environmental migration in key international policy processes, in particular on oceans,
water, food, urban areas, disaster risk reduction and development, and within the Economic and Social
Council. Moreover, IOM contributed technical support on the topic of migration, the environment and
climate change to the process towards a global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration.

Reintegration

159.      Providing reintegration assistance to migrants returning to their country of origin is an
essential component of the Organization’s approach to assisted voluntary return. This type of
assistance helps to improve returnees’ socioeconomic well-being and enhance their inclusion in the
community. In 2017, IOM’s reintegration activities were mostly implemented under the umbrella of
assisted voluntary return and reintegration schemes, by 93 offices.

160.      In addition, 17 offices provided post-arrival and reintegration assistance to migrants
returning under the auspices of stakeholders other than IOM (both voluntarily or forcibly), or returning
by their own means.

161.     The larger part of the reintegration assistance provided by IOM offices consisted of financial
support and in-kind assistance, with counselling and referrals being provided when relevant. Globally,
about 56,000 returnees received cash assistance and more than 47,500 received individual in-kind
assistance (e.g. in the areas of education, health, housing, micro-business set-up, vocational training,
job placement and legal services) and more than 2,300 received collective reintegration support.
Considering the complexity of reintegration, IOM promotes an integrated approach, one that
addresses the needs of individual returnees and communities in a mutually beneficial way.

162.      A number of collective or community-based projects were implemented in 2017. In West and
Central Africa alone, 108 community-based initiatives were supported with the aim to improve the
conditions for return and reintegration in the community and to address the challenges and
opportunities for the community. These projects were mostly implemented in the context of voluntary
returns from transit centres in the Niger to neighbouring countries. Overall, 14 offices were involved
in reintegration-related activities that targeted communities of return.

163.     Reintegration can be considered sustainable when returnees have attained levels of
economic self-sufficiency, social stability within their communities and psychosocial well-being which
allow them to cope with remigration drivers. Having achieved sustainable reintegration, returnees are
able to make further migration decisions a matter of choice, rather than necessity. In 2017, IOM
-----------------------Page 36 End-----------------------

                                                                                                C/109/4
                                                                                                Page 31


developed a set of field-tested indicators relating to the economic, social and psychosocial dimensions
of reintegration, together with a scoring system to measure post-return outcomes and to facilitate
understanding of returnees’ progress towards sustainability. Such tools will allow IOM and other
practitioners to compare trends in returnees’ reintegration across countries and, over time, to improve
the performance of such programmes.

164.       Combined efforts and engagement of a variety of actors – governmental and non-
governmental, public and private, local and international – with different mandates and areas of
expertise are also important to address the structural factors at play and foster an environment
conducive to migrant reintegration. In 2017, 21 community leaders, 519 local or national government
officials, 26 media representatives, 10 private sector partners and 159 reintegration-related service
providers (CSOs or NGOs) received IOM training on reintegration. In Cyprus, for instance, IOM
facilitated a training session for various stakeholders which focused on the provision of such support
to migrants with specific health needs. The training highlighted the specific needs of these returnees
and necessary programmatic responses.


OBJECTIVE 2: MOBILITY DIMENSION OF CRISES

IOM’s comprehensive approach to crises

165.     In 2017, IOM crisis-related programming reached over 28.9 million people.

166.       MCOF sets out the Organization’s comprehensive approach to operations before, during and
after a crisis. Thirty-six IOM offices reported that they developed or updated a crisis response strategy
using MCOF in 2017. Partners and stakeholders participated in planning sessions in several locations,
such as South Sudan and Turkey, where they were introduced to the MCOF approach and the related
frameworks, such as the Progressive Resolution of Displacement Situations Framework, and
humanitarian policy. IOM also launched an online MCOF course, taken by 167 staff members.

167.      Guidance, training and tool development are critical to bolster and maintain IOM’s
operational effectiveness across all of its priority work areas. As internal displacement occupies a
significant share of the Organization’s crisis-related programming, IOM launched its Framework for
Addressing Internal Displacement.

168.       The annual Emergency Response Induction Training, designed to build the Organization’s
capacity to effectively respond to crisis situations taking into account the Principles for Humanitarian
Action, was held in South Africa in support of 26 IOM staff members and standby partners. This training
expands the pool of qualified IOM staff who can be deployed in emergency situations and has become
an integral part of institutional capacity-building. It has enabled the deployment of 57 staff members
and three standby partners over the past three years. In addition, building on two years of capacity-
building activities to improve the assistance provided to migrants in countries in crisis, IOM developed
a guidance note for its Country Offices to support capacity-building, preparedness and coordination
activities.

169.     To achieve stronger organizational capacity and preparedness, IOM developed internal
guidance and established a template for standard operating procedures for cash-based interventions
which spans several fields, including remittances, reparations, emergency assistance, support for
voluntary and safe return, resettlement and early recovery. The Organization also developed and
piloted training tools to support closer collaboration between CCCM and mental health and
psychosocial support teams. A foundational course on humanitarian protection for all newly recruited
IOM protection officers was also developed. At the end of the year, IOM had 71 protection officers and
protection focal points working side by side with all other key response and recovery personnel.
-----------------------Page 37 End-----------------------

C/109/4
Page 32


Furthermore, IOM developed and conducted pilot training to enhance staff capacity to understand
when, where and how to implement transition and recovery programming in crisis and fragile contexts.

170.       Increasingly recognized as a leading agency on mainstreaming initiatives to prevent gender-
based violence, IOM continued to develop innovative, operational, context-adaptable tools and
guidance. In 2017, IOM cascaded initiatives at the operational level, allowing CCCM, shelter and DTM
staff and partners to roll out and adjust tools in their operations, and to strengthen their collaboration
with country-level working groups addressing gender-based violence and specialized agencies. These
efforts have had an impact on cluster-level responses and are regarded as among the most dynamic
initiatives in the humanitarian sector. In total, 20 countries benefited from technical support to
mainstream gender-based violence prevention and risk mitigation in emergency operations – including
through the deployment of rapid response advisers in 15 humanitarian crises. Furthermore, over
500 staff and partners were trained on gender-based violence mainstreaming considerations.

171.       Efforts to counter human trafficking in humanitarian settings progressed further in 2017,
namely by integrating activities to identify and assist victims of trafficking who are among the larger
crisis-affected population, and to establish mitigation measures to prevent trafficking emerging in
crisis situations. Complementing these efforts, IOM co-leads the Task Team on Anti-Trafficking in
Humanitarian Action, established in May 2017 within the Global Protection Cluster to develop a
collective position, guidance and practice for anti-trafficking interventions through the humanitarian
cluster system.

Crisis preparedness

172.     The internal Emergency Preparedness Monitoring Report was established to reinforce the
Organization’s capacity to anticipate, act early and effectively respond to likely, imminent hazards.
Prepared biannually, in line with the IASC Early Warning, Early Action and Readiness Report, the report
enables IOM to more effectively contribute to inter-agency preparedness efforts.

173.       As part of preparedness activities, IOM also trained governments and humanitarian partners
on CCCM, DTM, shelter, MICIC, health, protection and gender-based violence mainstreaming. CCCM
capacity-building events were held at the national and subnational levels in 28 countries, benefiting
camp managers, other on-site support staff and personnel with administrative and policy tasks. IOM
also continued to train national authorities in areas where it is the principal CCCM coordination actor,
like the large-scale emergencies in Bangladesh, Nigeria and South Sudan.

174.      IOM supported the efforts of nine countries to bolster their preparedness for potential large-
scale disasters and displacement situations by providing contingency planning and organized
preparedness workshops. In Nepal, this included conducting simulation events for first responders.
Furthermore, MICIC capacity-building events were held for national and regional audiences in over
30 locations, reaching out to 851 representatives of national emergency management institutions,
consular services, international organizations and CSOs. Specific events were organized under regional
processes, including the Puebla Process, the Colombo Process, the Pan-African Forum on Migration,
ECOWAS and the Regional Inter-Agency Standing Committee, covering Southern Africa.

Crisis response

175.      During 2017, IOM provided humanitarian assistance in more than 79 countries. It responded
to seven internal Level 3 emergencies, which included the ongoing system-wide emergencies in Iraq,
the Syrian Arab Republic and Yemen and IOM operations in South Sudan and Nigeria. New Level 3
emergencies were declared in relation to IOM relief operations in Libya and Bangladesh. The Level 3
emergency in South Sudan was deactivated in the second half of the year. To provide timely and
effective responses, IOM deployed 29 rapid response officers from Headquarters for surge support for
-----------------------Page 38 End-----------------------

                                                                                               C/109/4
                                                                                               Page 33


CCCM, shelter, DTM, gender-based violence and emergency operations to 33 locations, and 35 officers
for capacity-building activities to 41 locations. Rapid response officers were deployed within days to
nearly 80 per cent of the 13 new crises IOM responded to, in support of the first phase of the response.
The IOM emergency operations roster supports the rapid provision of short-term technical assistance
to improve emergency response operations. In 2017, the roster facilitated the deployment of essential
technical staff to 23 countries. An enhanced roster platform has been designed and will be launched
in 2018.

176.      With respect to IOM’s key role in inter-agency coordination of humanitarian assistance, the
Organization was engaged in 71 formally activated clusters and sectoral coordination or working
groups in 37 countries affected by crisis, sometimes leading on multiple sectors (in Bangladesh,
Colombia, South Sudan and Turkey), and participated in 34 of the 40 inter-agency humanitarian
appeals. It led or co-led 23 CCCM coordination platforms (including the newly activated CCCM clusters
in Peru in response to flooding, and in Somalia owing to the drought); 25 shelter and NFI coordination
mechanisms (e.g. in Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Nigeria, Pakistan and South Sudan); and 23 inter-agency or
other types of coordination platforms.

177.       When the Organization coordinated CCCM sectors, it had dedicated staff for coordination
(61% of cases), for information management (61% of cases) and for both areas (35% of cases). As the
Global CCCM Cluster co-lead, IOM initiated global discussions on mobile and area-based approaches,
the use of cash in camp and camp-like settings, camp management standards, women’s participation
and localization, many of which are foreseen to become priorities in 2018. IOM also played a strong
role in the Global Shelter Cluster, being a member of the Strategic Advisory Group and leading the GBV
in Shelter Programming Working Group and the Shelter Projects Working Group. Furthermore, IOM
joined the Global WASH Cluster in 2017 and continued to lead the inter-agency Global Solar and Water
Initiative, aimed at promoting the use of solar energy solutions in emergency water supply projects.

178.       The Organization’s CCCM activities, ranging from emergency responses and capacity-building
to disaster preparedness and contingency planning, took place in 45 countries. IOM carried out camp
maintenance activities at 236 sites, ensuring that standards of living were upheld. By the end of the
year, IOM’s CCCM operations had reached 2 million people living in more than 760 camps and camp-
like settings in 16 countries.

179.       In 2017, IOM’s shelter and NFI operations reached over 4.2 million people across
49 countries, 3.4 million of which in contexts where a shelter/NFI cluster was formally activated. This
latter figure accounted for nearly a third of the overall number of people assisted within formally
activated shelter/NFI clusters globally. About 70 per cent of IOM’s shelter and NFI support reached
populations affected by Hurricane Matthew (Haiti), the Rohingya refugee crisis (Bangladesh) and the
protracted crises in Iraq, Nigeria, South Sudan and the Syrian Arab Republic. While different modalities
of assistance are selected depending on the context, the vast majority of beneficiaries (94%) received
shelter-related and household NFIs.

180.      The Organization’s WASH programming assisted 3.9 million people in 28 countries, mainly in
Somalia, South Sudan and Yemen, which accounted for 63 per cent of overall IOM WASH assistance.
As a result of the programmes, 2.5 million people received clean water, 406,000 people gained access
to safe latrines, 1 million people benefited from other sanitation-related activities, and safe hygiene
was promoted for 1.4 million people.

181.     In crisis-response contexts, spanning humanitarian response and transition and stabilization
work, IOM undertook cash-based interventions in 17 countries, reaching 414,000 beneficiaries, which
represented a 27 per cent increase from 2016. In terms of total beneficiaries, the largest programmes
took place in South Sudan (vouchers for shelter upgrades), Afghanistan (unconditional cash grants for
-----------------------Page 39 End-----------------------

C/109/4
Page 34


basic needs and transport for returnees) and Ukraine (unconditional cash grants to cover basic needs
for internally displaced persons).

182.      In 2017, the DTM, which collects, analyses and disseminates data on population mobility,
was active in 54 countries, with the inception of new operations in 15 countries. Tracking the
movement of more than 30 million individuals (internally displaced persons, returnees, migrants) in
2017, the DTM contributed to designing effective, data-driven responses. During the year, 55 per cent
of DTM operations integrated protection indicators, including on gender-based violence and child
protection, into data collection activities. The new global DTM website was launched to improve
accessibility to data on internal displacement worldwide through an interactive platform.
Strengthened collaboration with the OCHA Humanitarian Data Exchange helped to increase
interoperability and availability of DTM data. In 2017, data for 30 per cent of countries with active DTM
operations were made available on the Humanitarian Data Exchange platform to inform responses by
cluster/sector partners. Also, IOM launched a new initiative to analyse DTM data to contribute to the
evidence-base for transition and recovery programming.

183.      The DTM was further developed to collect reliable baseline data on human trafficking and
migrant exploitation, abuse and vulnerability in crisis situations, displacement and large-scale
migration. For example, IOM’s flow monitoring operations on the eastern and central Mediterranean
routes have collected survey data on over 26,000 migrants. These unique data can inform counter-
trafficking response, and IOM is the first organization to undertake this type of work on such a scale.
In 2017, IOM used these data to produce a joint publication with UNICEF on the specific experiences
of children and youth migrating along the Mediterranean routes, Harrowing Journeys, and a
publication exploring the factors that make migrants vulnerable, Migrant Vulnerability to Human
Trafficking and Exploitation: Evidence from the Central and Eastern Mediterranean Migration Routes.

184.       In line with its global commitment on the centrality of protection, IOM undertook protection
activities in the context of crisis response in 41 countries, primarily through support to relevant line
ministries and state authorities. Migrants, internally displaced persons and members of crisis-affected
communities received direct protection assistance in 34 countries in the areas of mental health and
psychosocial support; prevention of and response to child abuse, neglect and exploitation (focusing on
unaccompanied and separated children); prevention, mitigation and response to gender-based
violence; and humanitarian evacuations. IOM provided capacity-building on protection to various
stakeholders in 33 countries and had a coordination function in 25 countries.

185.      In 2017, the IOM Migration Emergency Funding Mechanism was used to quickly respond to
humanitarian needs in Somalia, and in Bangladesh following the massive influx of Rohingya refugees
into Cox’s Bazar. Internal funding was released for 46 per cent of new crises, enabling IOM to respond
in a timely and flexible manner while resources were mobilized.

186.        The number of IOM offices providing health support within crisis contexts in 2017 doubled
compared to that of 2016, from 19 to 39. Health support is essential within humanitarian contexts and
remains a core and ever-growing component of IOM’s overall emergency programming. Of the offices
that provided health support, close to 70 per cent provided direct health services, including diagnostic
services. For example, in Iraq, IOM, in partnership with the Qatar Red Crescent, operated the Hamam
al Alil Field Hospital as part of the Mosul crisis response.

187.      The Organization continues to focus on building its internal capacity and that of its partners
and Member States in public health emergency preparedness and response. In 2017, 10 IOM offices
(an increase of 20% from the previous year) implemented projects that aimed to prevent, detect and
respond to health risks in relation to migration and human mobility (e.g. in Bangladesh, the Democratic
Republic of the Congo, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Morocco, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan and Yemen),
-----------------------Page 40 End-----------------------

including disease outbreaks. In Bangladesh, IOM established three diphtheria treatment centres that
triaged more than 5,300 and managed over 650 suspected cases. The Organization also participated
in an IASC system-wide simulation exercise for the Level 3 Activation Procedures for Infectious Disease
Events.

188.      IOM also provided additional services through rapid response and mobile teams (Iraq and
South Sudan), critical emergency referral services to secondary health-care facilities (Bangladesh,
Indonesia, Iraq, Libya, Myanmar and Turkey) and health system strengthening, including capacity-
building for health personnel (Bangladesh, Myanmar and Somalia). In line with global commitments of
humanitarian agencies to protect the rights, safety and security of women, men, girls and boys during
relief and recovery programmes, in 2017, IOM achieved its commitment to increase by 10 per cent the
number of migration health projects that include sexual and reproductive health activities.

189.     In addition, IOM provided emergency and community-based mental health and psychosocial
support services to displaced and host populations in Bangladesh, Iraq, Lebanon, Nigeria and
South Sudan and engaged in capacity-building in mental health and psychosocial support for local
professionals at various locations.

Transition, recovery and stabilization

190.     The impacts of natural hazards and conflict-induced crises continue to grow in scale and
complexity, with many crises recurring or being protracted in nature. IOM’s transition and recovery
programming focuses on preventing and providing solutions to displacement in fragile situations,
through community stabilization, durable solutions, transition and peacebuilding and disaster risk
reduction initiatives. In 2017, IOM launched training on transition and recovery programming in crisis
and fragile contexts. The Organization’s transition and recovery portfolio contributes to its
commitments to the Grand Bargain, in particular helping to define and communicate IOM’s work
across the humanitarian–development nexus.

191.       The Organization’s community stabilization work continued to play a key role in over
30 countries to address the drivers of displacement and create conditions for the restoration of normal
social, economic and political life in fragile and crisis-affected communities. Strong community
engagement contributes to social cohesion, laying the foundations for longer-term development and
stability across diverse settings. Programming in this area grew in Iraq, Libya, the Niger, the Philippines
and Yemen.

192.      The IOM peacebuilding portfolio is designed to prevent and resolve conflict, address drivers
of displacement, and support sustainable peace and reintegration. In 2017, IOM continued its support
of disarmament, demobilization and reintegration processes, including the reintegration of former
combatants in Colombia, Somalia and the Lake Chad Basin countries. In addition, IOM expanded its
peacebuilding projects to address the root causes of conflict and to manage conflict triggers and
dynamics in 14 countries. The Organization also provided electoral assistance and supported election
observation missions in Algeria, Ghana, Haiti, Honduras, Kenya, Liberia, Nepal, Sierra Leone and
Somalia.

193.     The Organization’s work on preventing violent extremism also grew during the year, with
eight countries engaged in activities to address underlying drivers, motivations and vulnerabilities to
violent extremism that may arise in contexts of marginalization, lack of opportunities and other
grievances. This programming is built on tailored and contextualized research which actively engages
vulnerable populations (e.g. youth in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Mali and Mauritania) through a
community-centred approach.

194.      IOM launched its Strategic Work Plan on Disaster Risk Reduction and Resilience 2017–2020,
which sets out a support framework for Member States implementing the Sendai Framework for
Disaster Risk Reduction 2015–2030. The workplan seeks to promote a unified, all-of-organization
approach to disaster risk reduction, while enabling consistency in IOM strategic communications and
resource mobilization efforts. During 2017, disaster risk reduction activities were carried out in
17 disaster-prone countries worldwide, including Afghanistan, Haiti, Myanmar, the Federated States
of Micronesia, Papua New Guinea and the Philippines. In 2017, IOM programming contributed to
achieving durable solutions through sustainable reintegration, local integration and relocation in over
26 countries, working with partners to build an evidence base through intention surveys and
community assessments, and addressing issues such as protection, livelihoods and housing, and
challenges relating to access to basic services and local governance. Supporting government leadership
to resolve displacement, IOM conducted capacity-strengthening activities, including policy
development support, in three countries.

Land, property and reparations

195.      Throughout 2017, IOM provided technical expertise, assistance and capacity-building on
land, property and reparations issues, working closely with government bodies, civil society and
communities in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Colombia, Iraq and Nepal. IOM also engaged with the
Government of Sri Lanka, providing expert advice and technical assistance in support of the transitional
justice commitments agreed to in the United Nations Human Rights Council resolution 30/1 of
1 October 2015. The Organization also submitted analysis and recommendations to the International
Criminal Court with respect to human rights violations committed in the Central African Republic
during 2002 and 2003.

Resettlement and relocation

196.      Moving at-risk migrants and refugees to safety is a core function of the Organization. The
principal areas of programming in 2017 were: refugee resettlement, relocation within Europe, and
voluntary humanitarian return from Libya. Collectively, these efforts serve as an effective international
protection tool, while providing a durable solution for those in the most vulnerable situations.

197.       During the year, IOM supported 42 States in conducting resettlement and humanitarian
admissions for 137,839 refugees and other vulnerable persons, with significant operations out of
Ethiopia, Jordan, Kenya, Lebanon, Nepal and Turkey. The Emerging Resettlement Countries Joint
Support Mechanism, jointly managed with UNHCR, helped establish or strengthen resettlement
activities in South America. Of the total aforementioned figure, 23,224 persons in need of international
protection were relocated to 24 different European countries, of which 8,794 departed from Italy, and
14,430 from Greece.

198.    The Humanitarian Evacuation Cell enabled 2,873 migrants to be evacuated by air or sea from
Yemen to eight different destinations and 19,370 migrants in vulnerable situations (80% male,
20% female) were evacuated from Libya to 27 countries of origin.

199.     Building on its resettlement, transition and recovery, labour mobility and border
management expertise, IOM also explored opportunities to expand complementary pathways to
admission (e.g. family reunification), and for displaced populations to use migration pathways to
progress towards achieving durable solutions.

Assistance for stranded migrants

200.      In addition to assisted voluntary return and reintegration, IOM assisted 197 stranded
individuals (45 different nationalities) in 2017 through its Humanitarian Assistance for Stranded
-----------------------Page 42 End-----------------------

                                                                                                                    C/109/4
                                                                                                                    Page 37


Migrants mechanism. The mechanism offers return assistance to migrants in vulnerable situations for
whom other assistance is not available. It enables IOM to quickly help stranded migrants to return
home voluntarily, safely and with dignity.


OBJECTIVE 3: SAFE, ORDERLY AND DIGNIFIED MIGRATION

201.      IOM endeavours to contribute to safe and orderly migration by mitigating the risks associated
with the movement of people and supporting orderly channels for migration and mobility. This focus
includes applying effective cross-border health measures, supporting safe and regular migration
channels, assisting States to manage their borders comprehensively, providing assisted voluntary
return assistance and strengthening public health strategies to prevent the spread of disease and
protect the health of migrants and society.

Safe and regular migration and visa facilitation

202.      The work of IOM related to the facilitation of migration aims to increase the pathways for
regular migration by enhancing visa processing procedures and to provide alternatives to the growing
trend to outsource migration management tasks to for-profit entities. In 2017,
202,786 beneficiarieswere assisted as part of operational solutions in support of permanent and
temporary visa applications. Additionally, 13,359 beneficiaries received assistance for humanitarian
visa applications.

203.     With regard to family reunification visas, 204,338 beneficiaries2 received remote and on-site
assistance as part of the Family Assistance Programme. As with all operations related to the facilitation
of migration, the Family Assistance Programme mainstreams gender and protection considerations
given that 81 per cent of beneficiaries are women, each with an average of two small children.

                         Number of beneficiaries receiving IOM visa-related support




204.     IOM facilities have also installed wheelchair ramps, lifts and specially equipped bathrooms
to accommodate migrants with specific needs. All 61 locations where IOM facilitates visa applications
can receive beneficiaries with reduced mobility. Centres under the Family Assistance Programme also
have day-care and child-friendly facilities.



2
    In this instance the number of beneficiaries refers to the number of times individuals were assisted through specific means
    and not the number of individuals assisted. For example, if the same person received assistance online, over the phone
    and at an IOM facility, that person would be counted three times.
-----------------------Page 43 End-----------------------

C/109/4
Page 38


205.      Vulnerability and gender considerations are incorporated in programming in this area. For
example, in the United Republic of Tanzania, the IOM office produced information notes and
visualisations for visually impaired migrants. In Rwanda, pregnant women were able to contact a nurse
around the clock seven days a week. In Honduras, children are accompanied by an escort during the
interview and travel process and receive expedited services for obtaining their documents.

Assisted voluntary return3

206.      IOM considers assisted voluntary return to be a humane and dignified option for migrants
who are unwilling or unable to stay in a host or transit country and decide to return to their country of
origin. This is a core activity conducted by the Organization for migrants and Member States across the
world.

207.       In 2017, IOM provided assisted voluntary return support to 72,176 migrants (68% male,
32% female), from 124 host or transit countries to 163 countries or territories of origin. This represents
a 27-per cent decrease compared with 2016, mainly due to a lower volume of returns from the
European Economic Area and Switzerland – although IOM assisted voluntary returns from this region
still account for 70 per cent of the total caseload. Such a decrease can be explained by a combination
of structural and contextual factors, varying from country to country (e.g. fewer migrant arrivals and
asylum applicants, and changes in national migration and asylum policies, including increased
emphasis on forced returns or restrictions on eligibility for assisted voluntary return).

208.     The 2017 figures confirmed the recent trend of intraregional voluntary returns. Of the total
number of assisted voluntary returns, 20 per cent were facilitated by IOM within Africa, with the
majority of these returns taking place from countries in West and Central Africa (50%) and the East
and Horn of Africa (24%). 4 Assisted voluntary returns from the Niger alone to countries in West and
Central Africa represented 45 per cent of the total caseload returning within the African continent.

209.     The Organization paid special attention to migrants in vulnerable situations, such as
unaccompanied migrant children, single mothers, migrants with health problems, victims of trafficking
and stranded migrants. In 2017, over 4.5 per cent of those benefiting from assisted voluntary return
were migrants in vulnerable situations.

210.      Operational partnerships, including through comprehensive referral systems and capacity-
building, contribute to effectively mobilizing mandates and expertise, avoiding duplication of efforts
and enhancing the scope and quality of assisted voluntary return schemes, particularly during the pre-
departure phase and the provision of counselling and information to potential returnees. In 2017,
40 offices established formal partnerships in the context of assisted voluntary return with stakeholders
such as government stakeholders, CSOs, international organizations and the private sector. Such
partnerships included mutual referral mechanisms between IOM and UNHCR in specific contexts
where refugee protection and other forms of international protection need to be articulated and
assistance made available to those not granted international protection. In Greece, for instance,
referrals to UNHCR ensured that all claimants to protection had access to information regarding their
rights on asylum-related issues.

211.      Structural initiatives are an important component of assisted voluntary return programmes.
Institutional dialogue is critical to bringing parties together in order to seek solutions to issues of
common concern in the area of return (and reintegration – see Objective 1, “Reintegration” section).
In 2017, 35 offices facilitated dialogue or capacity-building on return management at the local, regional
and international levels, with the main objective to adopt return- and reintegration-related guidelines.

Health assessment and travel health assistance

212.      IOM is entrusted by many countries to carry out health assessments and provide travel health
assistance to refugees and migrants prior to resettlement or departure. Health assessments have many
benefits, including the early detection and treatment of conditions of individual and public health
concern, safer travel and the prevention of health-related problems during travel or on arrival in host
communities.

213.      Through its pre-departure health assessment services, IOM ensures that migrants travelling
under the auspices of the Organization are fit to travel and receive necessary travel health assistance.
In 2017, IOM carried out nearly 345,000 pre-departure health assessments in over 80 countries around
the world for refugees in the resettlement pipeline and migrants applying for various categories of
visas. In Pakistan, IOM provided over 40,000 health assessments to beneficiaries travelling to
7 countries of destination, while, in Turkey, it provided health assessments for nearly
10,000 beneficiaries travelling to 20 different countries. In Greece and Italy, IOM provided pre-
departure health assessments and travel health assistance under the European Union relocation
scheme, aiding over 15,200 beneficiaries travelling to approximately 20 European Member States of
relocation.

214.      As part of its health assessment programmes, IOM also provided vaccinations to refugees
and prospective migrants in over 40 countries. These vaccination activities improve migrant health by
increasing coverage rates of key vaccines, particularly for refugees over 5 years old not covered by
traditional immunization programmes. These activities also reduce the risk of refugees or migrants
causing outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases in receiving communities.

Border and identity management solutions

215.     Effective border management is critical to ensuring the security of countries and the safety
and dignity of migrants; it can also facilitate trade, mobility of cross-border communities and overall
development. Eighty-seven IOM offices reported that they worked on border and identity
management during 2017, with engagement being mainly in border and migration management
-----------------------Page 45 End-----------------------

C/109/4
Page 40


assessments (35 offices), migrant smuggling (29 offices, also in cooperation with UNODC), and travel
document issuance and control (28 offices). Within these areas, IOM activities included capacity-
building, development of technical solutions, support for infrastructure improvement, advocacy, policy
advice and the organization of regional and global conferences.

216.    Furthermore, cross-border cooperation was strengthened in the Sahel through the
engagement of border communities in humanitarian border management. The implementation of the
humanitarian border management approach also increased inter-agency cooperation in the
Western Balkans to improve preparedness and responses to protect those crossing borders in
emergencies.

217.      The Organization assisted States, including Burkina Faso and Guinea, with the installation of
MIDAS – the IOM border management information system – at border-crossing points to facilitate
more efficient processing of travellers, including migrants, while enhancing border security. In
addition, the installation of MIDAS in Cambodia assisted the country to efficiently and safely process
locals who travel daily across the border to Thailand.

218.      IOM also intensified its efforts to provide technical assistance to Member States in the areas
of traveller identification management – as part of its broader border management programming and
increased cooperation with the International Civil Aviation Organization. IOM engagement in traveller
identification management helps to create solid foundations for effective identity and border
management. For example, IOM is assisting the Government of Armenia with its approach to e-
passport and e-identity procurement and management. Also, a new project in the Western Balkans is
assisting several States with preparatory work for the adoption of advance passenger information
systems.

219.       Gender considerations were also a core component of IOM’s border management work, with
specific activities in 38 countries. In Afghanistan, IOM encouraged greater female participation in
training. In Georgia, it organized the annual Women in Policing Conference, in cooperation with the
US Department of State, with law enforcement representatives from various countries and regions.
The Organization also provided technical support, for example, by drafting standard operating
procedures containing targeted information on gender-related issues.

220.     As an intrinsic part of border management engagements, IOM seeks to address specific
vulnerabilities of migrants and travellers crossing borders. Thirty-seven offices reported that they
focused on this during the reporting period; for example, in Montenegro, training was held on
processing unaccompanied minors at borders.


ORGANIZATIONAL EFFECTIVENESS

221.      IOM continues to be a principled, accountable and transparent organization, as detailed
under the “Principle 1” section of the present report. It also aims to demonstrate its operational
efficiency and solid implementation expertise, and ensures that it has capacity to change and grow. As
the Organization continues its transition towards a results-based approach, with increased monitoring
and evaluation capacity, it also seeks to enhance its knowledge management and risk management
capacities. At the same time, IOM is working to increase its budget through more flexible funding, and
continues to expand its membership and develop partnerships, particularly with the private sector.
Furthermore, the Organization strives to change the narrative on migration and to make its work
known. To perform its mandate, IOM has professional and capable staff who meet the identified skill
needs of the Organization. The below sections describe the progress made by the Organization on
these core performance indicators.
-----------------------Page 46 End-----------------------

                                                                                              C/109/4
                                                                                              Page 41


Operational efficiency

Results-based management

222.      In 2017, significant strides were made in mainstreaming a results-based approach at the
institutional level. Planning and reporting were improved at the central level, through the strategic
MiGOF and organizational effectiveness results frameworks used for planning and reporting purposes
across the Organization. The MiGOF results framework, piloted in 2016, was reviewed in 2017 to
ensure consistency and synchronization with other institutional initiatives linked to results-based
management, such as the project management system, PRIMA, and MiGOF training. The new country
and regional strategies are derived from the MiGOF results framework. In 2017, 50 offices revised
existing or created new strategies based on the MiGOF results framework.

223.      Internal and external communication on IOM results was enhanced through webinars
(reaching one in six staff members) and annual reports. Internal reporting and coordination was also
strengthened through one central reporting system, namely the institutional questionnaire (for which
the participation rate reached 95% in 2017), which provided the data for the preparation of the present
report. Further improvements are nevertheless still needed to improve the quality of reporting, for
systematic use of results and evidence for decision-making, and to ensure a full transition to results-
based management.

Monitoring and evaluation

224.     Great progress was made in strengthening the core monitoring and evaluation functions of
the Organization, for example by providing technical guidance to offices worldwide and developing
various training packages. Training for internal evaluators was piloted in 2017, and an online
monitoring and evaluation course was developed to improve IOM’s internal capacity. In addition,
monitoring and evaluation guidelines were drafted to strengthen these functions at project level,
based on extensive needs assessment. During the reporting period, 23 evaluations were conducted at
IOM worldwide.

Knowledge management

225.      Knowledge management was also a focus of the Organization in 2017. The review of IOM’s
knowledge management launched at the end of the year will provide recommendations on knowledge
management practices across the Organization. Some of the initiatives that have already taken place
to share good practices and lessons learned are described below.

226.      The IOM Development Fund completed a review of all ex-post evaluations carried out in 2017
on projects financed by the Fund. The review collated and analysed the key findings of the evaluations,
formulated lessons learned and provided recommendations for project developers and managers and
technical specialists. These recommendations can also be used in the Fund’s strategic planning and
fund disbursement decision-making. Another initiative, the Global Knowledge Management project,
funded by the US Bureau of Population, Refugees and Migration, enabled IOM to capture and
disseminate lessons learned through the 10 Regional Migration Programmes funded by the Bureau.
The project produced knowledge uptakes which can serve as global knowledge products for
policymakers and practitioners. The IOM Migration Health Research Portal is a knowledge
management website for technical resources such as policy briefs, research papers and relevant data
or profiles on migration and health.

227.     Other noticeable initiatives included guidance material produced by all departments on their
core expertise, building upon lessons learned from past experiences and covering a wide range of
themes, such as research, community-based complaints mechanisms, emergency transport, shelter,
-----------------------Page 47 End-----------------------

Page 42


NFI assistance, site planning, information management, and project development, implementation,
reporting and evaluation.

Risk management

228.     Sound risk management is critical to the preparedness of the Organization to deal with and
respond to crises. IOM’s risk management policy and framework aim to effectively identify, assess and
manage the uncertainties that the Organization faces in achieving its objectives. In 2017, the
Organization continued to roll out its risk management process and to integrate the process in key
decision-making and business processes. The offices that have integrated risk management to date
represent over 45 per cent of the Organization’s total expenditures. Risk assessments have been
performed in the nine Regional Offices and at Headquarters, as well as for the IOM global procurement
and supply chain.

Training and workshops

229.       Internal training and workshops on migration governance, key migration themes and core
skills have ensured that IOM staff have the competencies required to perform their duties effectively.
In 2017, IOM conducted core skills and thematic courses for staff members around the world. The
courses, some of which were also aimed at IOM partners, covered a wide range of themes, such as
MiGOF (including training for 350 government officials from 15 countries); resources management in
emergencies, considering the specific needs of humanitarian actions; the Principles for Humanitarian
Action; humanitarian protection; transition and recovery programming in crisis and fragile contexts;
emergency response induction training; and training for movement and transport staff focusing on
skills such as communication, fraud prevention, diversity and sexual orientation and gender identity
issues.

230.    Financial competencies were reinforced with 200 staff gaining IPSAS licences during the year.
The Organization also developed a customized online financial training and certification module.

231.      Further manuals and guidance were released in 2017 on key topics, such as the DTM, data
protection and data governance, the MICIC Initiative, gender-based violence, counter-trafficking in
crises, and migration and health. Eight financial guidelines were also issued to provide additional
guidance to offices on specific financial reporting and accounting matters. The period closure
instructions, which form a vital part of IOM financial control procedures, were revised to incorporate
lessons learned and new requirements. Work on an internal financial management manual continued
during the year.

Processes to support optimal delivery of services

232.      Internal control measures on IOM processes were reinforced. The nine Regional Offices
continued to provide guidance and support to the Field Offices. Regional experts provided day-to-day
technical support, for example, through project conceptualization, review, endorsement and
reporting, sharing best practices and supporting opportunities and new openings for regional synergies
and partnerships. This support is given through phone calls, on-site visits or online. Furthermore, other
technical contributions (e.g. through meetings, conferences, events and policy development) and
training were also provided in support of the field. Satisfaction surveys enabling Country Offices to
assess the regional support they received were conducted and the feedback received was positive.
These surveys are set to continue in 2018 to adapt the support provided to changing needs and
demands.

Resources management

Financial highlights

233.      In 2017, the Administrative Part of the Budget increased by CHF 5.2 million (an increase of
11.5%) and the Operational Part of the Budget increased by USD 152 million (an increase of 9.6%). The
increase in the Administrative Part of the Budget was mainly due to the full year of assessed
contributions from the Member States that joined the Organization in 2016 (i.e. China, Solomon
Islands, Tonga and Tuvalu) and the cost-sharing arrangements for participation in the United Nations
system, including staff and office costs.

234.     The combined total expenditure for the administrative and operational programmes reached
USD 1,605.4 million, representing an increase of USD 3.1 million compared with 2016. The expenses
related to the administrative programme largely aligned to the budget, with the exception of the
provision for doubtful receivables. The foreseen expansion of the operational programmes in 2017 did
not occur due to delays in concluding arrangements for project start-up and security-related
challenges. The deferred revenue under the operational programmes, which relates to contributions
received from donors in advance of performance delivery for activities to be completed beyond 2017,
reached USD 929.8 million as at 31 December 2017 compared with deferred revenue of
USD 760.0 million in 2016, reflecting an overall increase in funding secured for operational activities.

235.      During the year, the Working Group on Budget Reform worked on updating budget
regulations, notably in relation to the Operational Support Income reserve and the contingency
reserve, and on the development of key performance indicators to objectively assess the strength of
the core structure.

236.      In line with its commitments under the Grand Bargain, IOM started to adapt its accounting
policies and financial systems in 2017 and implemented a new approach enabling the tracking of
funding channelled to national partners and actors separately from funding channelled to international
partners.

237.     The Organization also initiated the development of an IT solution to enhance the integration
of financial planning and reporting into the Organization’s current system (PRISM), while taking
advantage of the reporting visualization capabilities of new business applications, and to optimize the
preparation of the Programme and Budget.

Cost-effectiveness

238.     In 2017, IOM’s staffing structure remained efficient and effective. The total number of staff
at year end was 10,978 (excluding consultants), reflecting the Organization’s global presence and
-----------------------Page 49 End-----------------------

Page 44


increasing engagement across a wide range of migration-related topics. As was the case the previous
year, 97 per cent of IOM staff were based in the field, and 3 per cent at Headquarters. The low
percentage of international staff (13%) compared with national staff (87%) also contributed to a lean
structure and strategic use of human resources.

239.      Cost-effectiveness was also demonstrated through IOM’s pre-positioned stocks, which are
essential to respond to sudden-onset crises. The global stocks help accelerate the supply chain process
and meet required standards, given that they are procured and their quality controlled according to
internationally agreed specifications. The pre-positioned global NFI stocks located in Manila, Nairobi
and Panama were used eight times to support emergency responses in Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Nepal,
the United Republic of Tanzania, Yemen and Sint Maarten. There was a 6.5-per cent increase in the
volume of items delivered through global stocks compared with 2016. Competitive bidding processes
were conducted for long-term agreements, and requests for quotations were issued for efficient and
effective replenishment of the global stock. Quality control equipment was also set up in the global
stock warehouse in Manila. Furthermore, a global warehouse manual was developed in 2017 and
includes cost-recovery process instructions. The use of the manual will lead to increased value for
money in 2018.

240.     The Organization also developed a common pipeline request system to foster transparency
with IOM implementing partners in sudden-onset crises when IOM manages in-kind contributions. By
the end of 2017, IOM had 49 central long-term agreements in place with service providers for services,
supplies and materials, including with airline companies. These long-term agreements enable the
Organization to reduce costs by an estimated 10 per cent. Requests for quotations for these
agreements are systematically issued under competitive bidding processes for the procurement of
standard global NFI stocks. In addition to the global stocks, 17 offices in emergency-prone regions pre-
positioned NFIs stocks for projects in their warehouses.

Human resources

•         Human resources management

241.      During the reporting period, the Organization saw an 8-per cent growth in staff, with the
total increasing from 10,184 in 2016 to 10,978 in 2017.

242.     While there was a 47-per cent increase in the number of appointments of international staff
through competitive processes, the time required for the recruitment process continued to decrease
in 2017, mainly due to the e-recruitment solution launched in 2016, automating and simplifying
procedures, and a new policy that clarified roles and responsibilities. It currently takes an average of
103 days to complete the recruitment process for a fixed-term international position (a decrease of 3
days compared with 2016) and 87 days for a short-term international position (a decrease of 11 days).

243.     Of the candidates selected for international positions through vacancy notices, 75 per cent
were internal staff and 25 per cent were external applicants. Of the 365 recruitments carried out
through vacancy notices, 69 were national staff recruited to international positions (19%).

244.     In 2017, 16 IOM offices had to go through a downsizing exercise, following the guidelines for
managing large downsizing exercises published in 2016. Furthermore, upon the recommendation of
the External Auditor, IOM reviewed and extended the Human Resources Strategy until the end of 2018.

245.      Several key human resources policies were issued in 2017, including on special leave without
pay, maternity, paternity and adoption leave, flexible working arrangements, part-time employment,
office attendance, and notice periods.

                                                                                                   Page 45


•         Consistent conditions for staff

246.      The Organization believes that the conditions of service should be consistent for all staff and
aims to treat all staff fairly and equally, regardless of their location, to the extent possible. IOM has
been rolling out the Unified Staff Rules in all countries of operations for staff in the General Service
category, which includes National Officers. At the end of 2017, 55 per cent of General Service/National
Officer staff were covered by the Unified Staff Rules (2016: 49%).

247.     IOM also successfully implemented the second phase of changes to the United Nations
common system compensation package for international staff, including a revision of the Unified Staff
Regulations and Rules as approved by the Member States.

•         Staff welfare, health and insurance

248.      IOM is responsible for ensuring that all staff work in a safe and healthy environment. During
the year, several instructions or staff advisories to promote staff health and effective management of
insurance were issued or revised, including on the health insurance policy, breast cancer prevention,
a cholera and Zika risk mitigation plan and medical insurance fraud detection. Doctors from the Health
and Insurance Medical Unit travelled to 11 IOM offices to assess health risks and facilities.

249.       Given the difficult environments in which the Organization operates and the challenges faced
by its staff on a daily basis, particularly those at the most difficult duty stations, the IOM Mental Health
Strategy was launched at the end of the year. It focuses on prevention, care, access to specialized
services, provision of preventive elements and accountability.

•         Workforce strengthening

250.      By providing the Organization with additional staff, Member States boost the capacity of IOM
to deliver and make progress on corporate initiatives. In 2017, such partnerships with Member States
resulted in several fellowships, secondments and experts on loan to IOM and the sponsoring of
26 Junior Professional Officers (2016: 21). IOM also signed the Inter-Organization Mobility Agreement
on the transfer, secondment or loan of staff among the organizations applying the United Nations
common system of salaries and allowances, and received three incoming transfers and one incoming
secondment from other United Nations agencies.

251.      IOM’s standby partners continued to play a critical role in the success of the Organization’s
emergency response operations and provided emergency personnel and service packages to fill
specific staffing gaps and augment IOM emergency response teams. In 2017, standby partners
provided IOM with over 6,400 personnel days to 20 Country Offices. IOM also continued its
collaboration with the International Humanitarian Partnership, which provided service packages and
short-term accommodation to humanitarian responders in Bangladesh and Nigeria.

•         Staff capacity and skills development

252.     IOM continued to promote an environment for developing staff skills in line with the
Organization’s strategic priorities. It allocated USD 1.6 million (2016: USD 1.3 million) to support staff
development and learning throughout the Organization for 2017. This represents USD 147 (2016:
USD 126) per capita.

253.     I-Learn, the new learning management system, was rolled out to 23 offices and populated
with 180 courses. This interactive electronic platform will improve how training and development
opportunities are organized, delivered and supported throughout the Organization.

•         Performance management

254.     Sound staff performance management is critical to overall IOM performance. When
managed effectively, performance management sustains staff commitment and motivation. The Staff
Evaluation System had a 72-per cent compliance rate in the 2017 performance cycle (2015–2016 cycle:
77%).

•         Diversity and inclusion and staff representation

255.      IOM is committed to the principle of diversity among its workforce and to promoting an
inclusive workplace, which enables staff to increase their contribution to the Organization and their
capacity to serve beneficiaries and Member States effectively.

256.     Following the recommendation made in the 2016 report entitled Diversity and Inclusion
within IOM, a diversity and inclusion officer was appointed in 2017 to take the report’s other
recommendations and workplan forward.

257.       While there was a slight decrease in the number of nationalities represented among the
global workforce (162 compared with 163 in 2016), geographical diversity at the international level is
progressing. Staff in the international Professional category represented 131 nationalities (2016: 127).
Staff at the P-4 to D-2 levels represented 84 nationalities (2016: 79), 38 per cent (2016: 36%) of which
from countries that are not members of the OECD Development Assistance Committee. Seventy-
three per cent of Member States are represented among international Professional staff (2016: 70%).
Annexes III to VI provide a full breakdown of the staffing structure by nationality, grade and sex.

•         Workplace conflict prevention and resolution

258.      IOM applies the standards of the International Ombudsman Association, whose Code of
Ethics require an ombudsperson to act in an independent, neutral, impartial, confidential and informal
manner in addressing work-related issues in the organization he or she serves. In 2017, the IOM
Ombudsperson provided a safe space to resolve workplace issues, including gender-related concerns,
in an informal and confidential manner. This helped ensure IOM has the capacity to fulfil its mandate
by reducing costs related to conflict – which could include litigation and legal fees – employee
replacement and reduced productivity. In 2017, the Ombudsperson helped to resolve 281 workplace
issues.

259.      In addition, 1,400 staff took part in conflict prevention activities to help them develop the
necessary skills to prevent workplace conflict and capitalize on lessons learned from constructive
conflict management. An e-learning platform on conflict resolution skills and a handbook and booklet
on conflict resolution-related topics were created. All of these activities were carried out to align the
Ombudsperson’s work with International Ombudsman Association standards.

•         Staff security

260.       In 2017, IOM provided 1,928 IOM and United Nations Security Management System
personnel with specialized security training. Within this total number, 1,076 people attained
certification in the United Nations Safe and Secure Approaches in Field Environments training, which
is mandatory at 26 duty stations. This enabled IOM to rapidly deploy personnel in emergencies and
enhanced the capacity of IOM staff to operate in high-risk areas. Other training was delivered by IOM
on first aid kits, security awareness for women, hostage incident management and responding to
active shooting incidents, among others.

                                                                                                 Page 47


Information technology

261.       The Organization launched its application for mobile devices, MigApp, on International
Migrants Day (18 December). MigApp responds to the need to help migrants make informed decisions
throughout the migration process and aims to offset the large volume of misinformation on migration
in circulation today. It enables a secure two-way communication channel between IOM and migrants.
MigApp also aims to provide a platform for migrants to share their experiences and provide feedback,
including reports of abuse and needs. Such contributions from migrants will serve to flag risks to help
inform other migrants.

262.       The further development of PRIMA, which is intended to improve institutional results-based
management and organizational effectiveness, is on track; however, roll-out plans were delayed due
to a funding shortfall (approximately USD 2.1 million). Depending on funding, roll-out was expected to
start in the third quarter of 2018.

263.     The institutional questionnaire platform was redesigned in 2017 and will serve as the basis
for a comprehensive, interactive platform to visualize IOM’s results globally and across all sectors, with
the aim to improve results-based decision-making and knowledge management at all levels of the
Organization.

264.     Data security is a core concern of the Organization. In 2017, IOM dedicated significant
resources to improve cyber security following the related audits carried out in 2016. Additional work
is needed on identity, access and vulnerability management and user-awareness training.

265.     Further IT solutions delivered in 2017 included a centralized portal for all IT requests across
the Organization, the roll-out of new productivity software to provide a platform for online
productivity and collaboration services, and an online contracts and agreement review system.

Representation

Privileges and immunities

266.     Privileges and immunities ensure that the Organization and its staff have operational
independence. Work to improve the privileges and immunities granted to IOM was continued in 2017.
The Organization benefits from full privileges and immunities in 92 countries (91 of which are
Member States), partial privileges and immunities in 58 (52 of which are Member States) and none in
36 countries (26 of which are Member States). These figures represent a slight improvement on those
reported for the previous year, and work in this area will continue in 2018.

Member States and observers

267.     With its growing number of Members and observers, IOM is better able to support good
migration governance. In 2017, three new Member States joined the Organization, namely the
Cook Islands, Cuba and Dominica. At the end of the year, total membership stood at 169 Member
States.

268.      IOM observers were joined by one State, namely Kuwait, and five United Nations entities:
UNAIDS, United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia, UNFCCC, United Nations
Office for Disaster Risk Reduction and UNODC. In addition, two intergovernmental organizations (Latin
American and Caribbean Parliament; and Partners in Population and Development) and one NGO
(AMEL Association International) joined the Organization as observers.
