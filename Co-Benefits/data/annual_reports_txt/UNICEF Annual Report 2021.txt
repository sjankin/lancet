Protecting children from
the impacts of conflict,
climate change and COVID-19
In 2021, the second full year of the COVID-19
pandemic, UNICEF worked tirelessly together with
partners to protect children’s rights in the face of
the mounting impact of COVID-19 and other threats
including armed conflict and climate change.

The pandemic has exacerbated risks and cut
opportunities for children affected by fragility
and humanitarian crises, where conflict and
climate change impacts have already devastated
communities.

COVID-19’s harm to children – largely from unintended
consequences of efforts to manage the pandemic – is
clear. A record rise in child poverty has left an additional
100 million children facing deprivations in critical areas.
Setbacks to progress in routine immunization increased
the number of unvaccinated children by 3.4 million.

UNICEF continued its work to alleviate the impacts
of COVID-19, poverty and crises on children while
strengthening national systems to reach the most
marginalized, excluded children and communities
and to enhance preparedness and resilience in
the face of future shocks. This work was possible
thanks to strong public, private and civil society
partnerships, including across the United Nations
system, and voluntary funding.

Unprecedented disruption to education has
increased learning poverty. And isolation and
uncertainty are taking a serious toll on children’s
mental health, exacerbating a long-ignored crisis.
COVID-19 vaccines and new treatments began to blunt
the deadly impacts of the virus in 2021, enabling widely
vaccinated societies to tentatively reopen. But unequal
access perpetuated the inequalities the pandemic had
already deepened. Just 1 in 6 people in low-income
countries have been vaccinated with at least one
dose, compared to 3 in 4 in high-income countries.
Beyond the pandemic, conflicts including in
Afghanistan, northern Ethiopia, Myanmar and Yemen
unleashed grave violations of children’s rights and
displaced children and their families, driving record
humanitarian needs.
Globally, approximately 1 billion children – nearly half
of the world’s children – live in countries that are at
an ‘extremely high risk’ from the impacts of climate
change. Its relentless progression fueled natural
disasters, water scarcity, food insecurity and disease
outbreaks, threatening children’s health, well-being
and security – especially those from the poorest,
most disadvantaged communities.

The interconnected challenges facing the world in
2021 reinforced the urgent need for a reinvigorated
multilateralism. To enable the United Nations
system to provide more effective, coordinated
support to countries, UNICEF contributed to its
vision of a new social contract.
Despite facing multiple crises, today’s young
generation is more hopeful and confident that
the world is becoming a better place. In 2021,
UNICEF’s Changing Childhood project surveyed
over 20,000 people across 21 countries and found
that instead of despairing in the face of inequality
and the climate crisis, young people are more
confident that the world is becoming a better place
compared to those aged 40 and older.
In 2021, UNICEF commemorated its 75th
anniversary, recommitting ourselves with a new
spirit of urgency to work with partners, supporters
and children and young people to ensure children
survive and thrive into healthy, productive
adulthood and to protect the most marginalized and
vulnerable.

Renewed ambition toward 2030
UNICEF Strategic Plan 2022-2025
The COVID-19 pandemic struck
as progress towards most of the
Sustainable Development Goals was
already off-track, fueling a global
crisis that threatens progress for
children, aggravating deep-rooted
poverty, and increasing inequality
and discrimination.

UNICEF will build upon successful programming
adaptations and innovations during the pandemic
that enabled continued service delivery and
support to strengthen national systems amid
disruptions including flexible, community-based
approaches and digital modalities. In 2021, it
became clear that UNICEF-supported investments
in systems strengthening before the pandemic
made a critical difference in enabling countries to
regain progress that had stalled.

In 2022, UNICEF is embarking on its next fouryear Strategic Plan, providing a global framework
for all UNICEF offices, country programmes
and National Committees. UNICEF will focus on
systemic changes that are critical to addressing
the underlying causes of children’s mortality,
poverty, vulnerability, gender inequality
and exclusion.

To meet the ambitious goals of the Strategic Plan,
UNICEF will draw on its strengths: a vast, broad
network of partners across sectors; local presence
in over 190 countries and territories; and deep
expertise and thought leadership based on field
evidence, research and data.

Through these systemic changes, transformative
progress can be achieved on vaccine equity,
education, mental health, and addressing the
climate crisis, reaching those who have been
left behind.

But UNICEF cannot do it alone. UNICEF will
mobilize other stakeholders to catalyse
sustainable change at scale. Partnerships and
engagement – with the public and private sectors,
civil society and community organizations, children
and youth, and within the United Nations system –
are essential.

Partnerships and funding

Flexible, quality funding is
essential to UNICEF’s ability to
manage complexity and build
responsive programmes at the
country level.
Across the 2018-2021 Strategic Plan, progress
for children was higher in programme areas
with a larger proportion of regular resources
(flexible, unrestricted funding). Yet overall, UNICEF
income trends reflect increasing earmarking and
decreasing funding flexibility and predictability.

and interorganizational arrangements) increased
by $393 million (up 7 per cent from 2020),
totaling over $6 billion. The largest government
contributions in 2021 came from the United States
of America, Germany, European Commission,
Sweden and Japan.
Private sector revenue (from National Committees,
individual donors, non-governmental organizations
and foundations) increased by 34 per cent since
2020, to $2.2 billion in 2021.

UNICEF revenue saw a good year in 2021,
with 2018-2020 showing an overall increase of
30 per cent compared to 2014-2017. However,
challenges continued in funding humanitarian appeals
– despite record-level humanitarian needs – and in
raising regular resources and other flexible funding
that are key to the organization’s ability to respond
quickly, innovate and adapt to children’s evolving
needs, as the COVID-19 response has shown.

National Committees for UNICEF contribute
significant results in income and influence.
In 2021, National Committees generated
$1,758 million, 84 per cent of total private
sector revenue and approximately 47 per cent
of total UNICEF regular resources. National
Committees reached more than 4.5 million
children through Child Rights Education,
14 million children through the Child Friendly
Cities platform and over 108 million children
through engaging with the business sector.

In 2021, total public sector revenue (from

GOAL AREA 1

Every child survives and thrives
In 2020, 5 million
children under age 5
died - 13,800 children
every day.

Nearly 50 million children
suffer from wasting, the
most life-threatening
form of malnutrition.
This figure could increase
by 9 million due to the
pandemic’s impact on
children’s diets, nutrition
services and feeding
practices.

COVID-19 has upended progress on every measure of child survival,
health, growth and development.
The number of preventable under-five deaths continues to be unacceptably
high. Global coverage of diphtheria tetanus toxoid and pertussis (DTP3)
immunization, stagnant since 2010, is now falling, from 86 per cent in 2019
to 83 per cent in 2020. Despite progress in reducing child stunting since
2000, wasting persists at alarming rates, and rising rates of overweight
will require a reversal in trajectory to achieve the 2030 target.
In 2021 UNICEF adjusted its programming as the world started
to move from fighting COVID-19 to living with it. The pandemic
highlighted the dire consequences of weak health systems and the
importance of investing in these systems.
Looking ahead, UNICEF is sharpening its focus on strengthening
primary health care as the cornerstone of resilient health systems and
as the key to universal health care that promote health and well-being
across the life cycle, so that children not only survive, but thrive.

KEY RESULTS

The number of live births delivered
in health facilities increased to
38.9 million, and the proportion
attended by skilled health
personnel increased to 80%in the
50 focus countries of the Every
Newborn Action Plan.

8

In 25 high-burden countries,
8.75 million children
with suspected pneumonia
received antibiotics.

UNICEF Annual Report 2021: Protecting child rights in a time of crises

UNICEF reached nearly 336 million
children with services to prevent stunting
and other forms of malnutrition (a 38%
increase over 2020), and 67.4 million
adolescents with services and support
to prevent anaemia and other forms of
malnutrition (a 91% increase from 2020).

GOAL AREA 2

Every child learns
By September 2021,
schoolchildren around
the world had lost an
estimated 1.8 trillion
hours of in-person
learning due to COVIDrelated school closures,
which will have profound
long-term, unequal social
and economic effects.

In 2021, the COVD-19 crisis brought education systems
across the world to a halt, with school closures exacerbating
a global learning crisis. While nearly every country offered
remote learning opportunities for students, their quality
and reach varied greatly, and they provided at best partial
substitutes for in-person learning. This generation of schoolaged children now risks losing $17 trillion in lifetime earnings
as a result of school closures, far more than the $10 trillion
estimated in 2020.

Over 50 per cent of
10-year-olds in lowincome and middleincome countries cannot
read and understand a
simple story by the end
of primary school.

KEY RESULTS

48.6 million out-of-school
children accessed education,
bringing the total to 149 million since
2016. Among them were 6.4 million
children on the move and 31.7 million
children in humanitarian settings.

UNICEF-supported skills
development programmes
benefited 33 million children
in 91 countries.

42 million children (18.1 million
in humanitarian settings) received
learning materials, bringing the
total since 2016 to 137 million
children.

GOAL AREA 3

Every child is protected from violence
and exploitation
In a majority of countries,
more than 2 in 3 children
are subjected to violent
discipline by caregivers.

12 million girls per year are
married before their 18th
birthday and more than 150
million additional girls are at
risk of becoming married in
childhood by 2030.

Decades-long progress in children’s protection and wellbeing have resulted in increases in birth registration and
reductions in child marriage and female genital mutilation.
Yet child labour rates have stagnated and are at risk of
increasing. And current projections indicate that impacts
of the COVID-19 pandemic may erode these gains,
jeopardizing progress towards protection-related SDGs.

KEY RESULTS

4.4 million children who had experienced violence
reached across 129 countries with health, social work
and justice services, 80% more than in 2017.
Community-based mental health and psychosocial
support, including targeted awareness campaigns,
reached over 8.4 million children and adolescents
in 111 countries (up 170% over 2017) and 3.6 million
parents and caregivers in 97 countries.

10

UNICEF Annual Report 2021: Protecting child rights in a time of crises

7.6 million adolescent girls across 47 countries received
child marriage prevention and care interventions through
regional alliances, particularly with the African Union, and the
traction gained by the UNICEF-UNFPA Global Programme to
End Child Marriage.
A major result in 2021 was the largest-ever release of children
from detention. Since the beginning of the pandemic, over
45,000 children across 84 countries have been
released. In 2021, child-friendly justice services reached
384,000 children in 81 countries.

GOAL AREA 4

Every child lives in a safe
and clean environment
Globally, approximately
1 billion children – nearly half
of the world’s children – live
in countries that are at an
‘extremely high risk’ from the
impacts of climate change.
2.3 billion people lack soap and
water at home, 900 million
children lack soap and water
at their school, and 40% of
healthcare facilities are not
equipped to practice hand
hygiene at points of care.

Despite significant progress in WASH, the world will struggle
to achieve SDG 6, leaving the rights of all children and their
families to safe water and sanitation unfulfilled. As of 2021,
3.6 billion people still lack access to safe sanitation, one quarter
do not have safely managed water services, and one third do
not have a handwashing facility with soap in their homes.
From 2018 to 2021, UNICEF reached 69.9 million people with
access to safe drinking water and 59.6 million with basic
sanitation, against a target of 60 million each – the most
ambitious target set, and reached, to date.

KEY RESULTS

106 countries implemented national communitybased handwashing programmes with UNICEF
support, exceeding the target of 78.

Through UNICEF humanitarian relief programmes,
33.3 million people gained or regained access
to water services for drinking and hygiene, and
8.4 million to sanitation services.

GOAL AREA 5

Every child has an equitable
chance in life
More than 1 billion children
worldwide now suffer at least
one deprivation in critical
areas of their rights.

The COVID-19 pandemic pushed an estimated 100 million
additional children into multidimensional poverty. The crisis
significantly increased the vulnerability of women and
girls, putting an additional 10 million girls at risk of child
marriage, on top of pre-pandemic projections of 100 million
more child brides by 2030.

COVID-19 has exacerbated
barriers facing the world’s
240 million children with
disabilities, who account for
1 in 10 children, based on
new estimates from over 40
countries published by UNICEF
in 2021.

KEY RESULTS

UNICEF supported 78 countries
in building capacity on child poverty
measurement, and 33 countries
reported that measurement, analysis
or advocacy led to policies and
programmes that reduced child poverty.

including in humanitarian situations,
more than double the 2.2 million
reached in 2020.

Gender

Humanitarian

Globally, 22% of adolescent girls
aged 15-19 are not in education,
employment or training (NEET)
compared to 12% of boys of the
same age.

Globally, 426 million children –
nearly 1 in 5 – live in conflict zones
that are becoming more intense
and taking heavier toll on civilians,
disproportionally affecting children.

Around 1 in 3 girls aged 15-19
today have undergone female
genital mutilation (FGM) in
the 30 countries where it is
concentrated.

An estimated 35 million (42%) of
the 82.4 million forcibly displaced
people as of mid-2021 were
children below 18 years of age,
many unaccompanied or separated
from their families.

Progress in areas such as menstrual health,
girls’ learning, child marriage prevention, genderresponsive social protection, WASH and maternal
health illustrate the importance of deliberate gender
results, with clear indicators and targets, and of
gender-targeted resourcing.
But other areas such as gender-based violence,
harmful practices, and girls’ secondary education,
remain under-resourced by partners in some cases
and plagued by deep-rooted and persistent barriers
to progress, and have been subjected to alarming
risks of setbacks owing to the effects of the
COVID-19 pandemic.

Amidst the unprecedented global crisis caused by
the COVID-19 pandemic, 235 million people were
in need of humanitarian assistance and protection
in 2021 – the highest number in decades, projected
to rise to 274 million in 2022. Conflict remained the
key driver of humanitarian needs. Disease outbreaks
continued to increase, while climate change and natural
disasters caused an increasing number of extreme
weather events and continued to exacerbate existing
vulnerabilities, particularly in countries beset by violence.
KEY RESULTS

UNICEF responded to 483 new and ongoing
humanitarian crises in 153 countries in 2021,
compared with 455 in 153 countries in 2020.
