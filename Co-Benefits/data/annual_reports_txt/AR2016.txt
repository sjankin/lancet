decentralization plan.


Decentralization is an overarching theme that
will be driving many of our major initiatives over
the next five years. We have been building our
field presence since 2003, stressing the importance
of country office staff participation in project
design, supervision and implementation. And we
are now moving from field presence to corporate
decentralization.    We    have   identified    three
important benefits of decentralization that focus on
non-lending activities: policy dialogue, partnership
development and knowledge management. Having
piloted different types of field presence, as we
decentralize we are consolidating around a few
models, while maintaining some flexibility to
adapt to specific circumstances. The existing and
proposed IFAD country offices will be configured
as subregional hubs, country programme groups
or individual country offices based on specific
criteria. (Take a look at the map inside the front
cover to see operational and planned IFAD country
offices and proposed subregional hubs.)


Development Effectiveness Framework. During
the year, and based on knowledge developed through
the IAI (see above), IFAD crafted a Development
Effectiveness Framework to build structures that
facilitate the use of evidence in designing and
implementing projects. The Framework is the next
logical step in IFAD’s evolution as a results-based
organization, and builds on the approach instituted
over a decade ago with the Results and Impact

year was in the form of highly concessional loans –                           at the end of 2016 (Table 11). This compared
worth a total of US$291.9 million. Ordinary loans                             with US$9,889.1 million disbursed at the end
made up 24.5 per cent of the total, followed by                               of 2015, which also made up 74 per cent of
blend loans with 21.6 per cent and DSF grants with                            effective commitments.
14.3 per cent (Chart 12).
    As a share of our cumulative financing portfolio
since 1978, highly concessional loans and DSF
grants represent about 72 per cent of the total, well
over the two-thirds target set out in IFAD’s Lending
Policies and Criteria. Table 8 shows investments by

SUMMARY OF 2016 PROGRAMMES, PROJECTS AND GRANTS
Programmes and projects
West and Central Africa
MAURITANIA: Inclusive Value Chain Development Project
A previous IFAD-supported project in Mauritania showed that market access
improves food security among poor people. It identified pro-poor value chains with
good nutritional potential through which vulnerable people, women in particular,
could gain value added from partnerships with the private sector. This project will
take that finding to the next step by involving poor rural people in profitable and
resilient value chains. It will identify market entry points, analysing demand before
supporting production increases. It will also bring rural people into the banking
system, formalize commercial transactions, promote contracts between value chain
actors and facilitate partnerships – in particular public-private-producer
partnerships that will benefit small farmers.
        Approved IFAD grant amount: SDR 10.8 million (equivalent to
        approximately US$15.0 million)
        Approved ASAP grant amount: SDR 4.3 million (equivalent to
        approximately US$6 million)
        Total project cost: estimated at US$45.2 million, of which national
        government will provide US$5 million, beneficiaries US$2.2 million and the
        private sector US$2 million
        Approximate reach: 42,600 direct beneficiaries
       Directly supervised by IFAD


East and Southern Africa
ERITREA: Fisheries Resources Management Programme
Eritrea has substantial and relatively underexploited marine and fisheries resources,
and this programme will support efforts to ensure that they are utilized sustainably
to improve the livelihoods of coastal communities. The initiative will support the
establishment of infrastructure and technologies for production and post-harvest
operations, marketing and consumption. It will also build the entrepreneurial
capacity of cooperatives and ensure they have access to the inputs required to
undertake economically viable and sustainable fish-related businesses. The target
group is small-scale fishers and rural smallholder farmers interested in accessing
the inland fisheries supply chain, and young entrepreneurs (fishers and non-fishers)
who want to respond to market demand for fishery products and services. Women
will account for at least 30 per cent of the programme’s beneficiaries, and the
initiative will also target demobilized soldiers and internally displaced persons.
        Approved IFAD grant amount: SDR 10.7 million (equivalent to
        approximately US$15 million)
        Total programme cost: estimated at US$32.1 million, of which national
        government will provide US$1.4 million, beneficiaries US$1.4 million, and
        cofinancing from the Federal Republic of Germany US$6.0 million, the Global

      Organization of the United Nations US$0.5 million
      Approximate reach: 293,942 rural households
      Directly supervised by IFAD
ETHIOPIA: Participatory Small-scale Irrigation Development Programme –
Phase II (PASIDP II)
Small-scale irrigation offers great potential for reducing the impact of climate
change, enhancing economic growth and reducing poverty in Ethiopia. The first
phase of this programme, completed in 2015, helped to reduce the country’s
vulnerability to climate risks and drought as well as rural poverty and food
insecurity. The second phase will hone the intervention model previously
developed, and will pilot the geographical expansion to be undertaken in the third
phase. It aims to develop at least 18,000 hectares of small-scale irrigation
schemes, and to rehabilitate and enhance climate resilience for 60,000 hectares of
land in the adjacent watersheds. The programme will adopt a participatory
approach and strengthen water users’ associations and farmers’ organizations,
including cooperatives, to develop agribusiness, market linkages and access to
financial services. It will enhance agricultural productivity through improvement of
crop husbandry practices and facilitate access to improved seeds. Gender-sensitive
activities will be undertaken and nutrition-sensitive agriculture will be promoted.
        Approved IFAD loan amount: SDR 72.1 million (equivalent to
        approximately US$102 million)
        Approved IFAD grant amount: SDR 1.1 million (equivalent to
        approximately US$1.5 million)
        Approved ASAP grant amount: SDR 7.9 million (equivalent to
        approximately US$11 million)
        Total programme cost: estimated at US$145.3 million, of which national
        government will provide US$18.7 million and beneficiaries US$12.1 million
        Approximate reach: 108,750 households
        Directly supervised by IFAD
RWANDA: Dairy Development Project
The dairy subsector offers a pathway out of poverty for many Rwandan households.
Annual milk production has already increased significantly since 2000, yet
performance lags behind other countries in the region. The project aims to
contribute to pro-poor national economic growth and improve the livelihoods of
resource-poor rural households. This will be achieved by focusing on food security,
nutrition and the empowerment of women and young people in a sustainable and
climate-resilient dairy value chain development. This project aims to intensify dairy
production and increase productivity among smallholder farmers and raise their
incomes by improving production and market access. It will support intensification
of climate-smart dairy production by increasing the capacity of dairy farmers to
sustainably supply higher volumes of quality milk to the dairy market. It also aims
to increase their earnings by building the capacities of cooperatives in milk
collection and marketing, input supply, animal health services and financial
services. In addition, the project will invest in infrastructure to increase the supply
of quality milk in domestic and regional markets and leverage financing for climate-

resilient dairy enterprise development. It will also facilitate the establishment of a
policy framework and institutional structure for the dairy sector.
        Approved IFAD loan amount: SDR 31.3 million (equivalent to
        approximately US$43.6 million)
        Approved IFAD grant amount: SDR 0.8 million (equivalent to
        approximately US$1.1 million)
        Total project cost: estimated at US$65.1 million, of which national
        government will provide US$3.9 million, beneficiaries US$5.9 million and
        cofinancing from Heifer Project International US$4 million and the private
        sector US$6.6 million
        Approximate reach: 100,000 resource-poor rural households of whom
        80,000 will be involved in dairy farming and 20,000 in off-farm activities.

ZAMBIA: Enhanced Smallholder Agribusiness Promotion Programme
Zambia’s Smallholder Agribusiness Promotion Programme (SAPP) has been making
significant progress in smallholder commercialization and agribusiness promotion.
This initiative will introduce the Enhanced Smallholder Agribusiness Promotion
Programme (E-SAPP). It will concentrate on building partnerships to facilitate the
transformation from subsistence farming to farming as a business. Building on
SAPP’s achievements, it aims to increase the volume and value of agribusiness
outputs sold by smallholder producers. E-SAPP will begin with work on the policy
and enabling environment, including efforts to integrate climate risk management
into policies. Then, through agribusiness partnerships, it will work to build the
capacity of smallholders and their service providers to compete for and implement
matching grants. This is key to helping smallholder farmers integrate into value
chains while also improving their productivity, incomes and nutritional outcomes.

ZIMBABWE: Smallholder Irrigation Revitalization Programme
Zimbabwe has one of the highest levels of irrigation in the region, but more than
half of smallholder irrigation schemes are either not functional or only partly
functional. The rehabilitation of these schemes is heavily dependent on government
and donor funding. This programme aims to break the vicious cycle of
building/operating/revitalizing irrigation schemes. It will sustainably revitalize
16,000 hectares of smallholder irrigation schemes, located mainly in the semi-arid
regions of four provinces. The programme’s target area contains almost half of the
country’s estimated total irrigation-equipped area. The capacity in government
departments will be strengthened so that they are able to provide quality services

                                           66
-----------------------Page 69 End-----------------------

to smallholder irrigators. Capacity-building will also focus on strengthening farmers’
ability to adopt a commercially oriented approach to production and render their
irrigation schemes profitable and sustainable, in part through the use of climate-
smart agricultural practices. A natural resources management facility will provide
matching grants to farmers in rainfed areas for income-generating projects that use
natural resources sustainably.

CAMBODIA: Accelerating Inclusive Markets for Smallholders Project
Many of the 4.3 million people who have moved out of poverty in Cambodia are still
vulnerable, and agricultural growth has stalled. It needs to be stimulated through
intensification, diversification and commercialization. This project aims to increase
returns from farming for smallholders, including young people, through efficient
public-sector investment. It will work to develop five high-value product value
chains covering crops and livestock and increase private investment in them. Using
IFAD’s public-private-producer partnership (4Ps) model, the project will develop
and promote links among buyers, producers and service providers. It will give
priority to innovation in local value chains, especially through a value chain
innovation fund, which will provide direct financial support to stimulate private
investment. The initiative will initially partner with three major microfinance
institutions, recognizing the importance of significantly increased financing for
farmers, agricultural cooperatives, agribusinesses and service providers.

INDIA: Andhra Pradesh Drought Mitigation Project
Smallholders in the Rayalseema region and Prakasam area of Andhra Pradesh are
affected by vulnerability to drought and depletion of groundwater resources in a
context of climate change and climate variability. The Andhra Pradesh Drought
Mitigation Project strategy has two main aims: i) to build the adaptive capacity of
farmers to drought through more efficient crop water management and income
diversification into livestock; ii) management of existing water resources through
building Gram Panchayat capacity in water planning and monitoring. The project
will work to improve farmers’ practices in using and producing drought-tolerant

LAO PEOPLE’S DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC: Strategic Support for Food Security
and Nutrition Project – Global Agriculture and Food Security Programme
(GAFSP)
Agriculture remains the largest source of employment in the country, but
malnutrition is high and 44 per cent of children under 5 in rural areas are
chronically undernourished. The project is aimed at piloting new approaches and
technologies to accelerate progress towards national food security and improved
nutrition. It will underpin the development of government capacities, procedures
and technical skills to support community implementation of nutrition interventions.
This will include sustainable market-led improvements in nutrition-rich agricultural
production and rural employment. Specifically, it will aim to empower women to
improve family diets, especially during children’s first 1,000 days of life; develop
farmer organizations to link farmers to markets; support demand-driven extension
services emphasizing a farmer-to-farmer approach; and support private
agribusiness investment. All interventions are to have a neutral or positive impact
on communities’ ability to adapt to climate change.

BRAZIL: Maranhão Rural Poverty Alleviation Project
Maranhão is the second largest state in northeast Brazil and one of the poorest in
the country. Yet conditions are favourable for reducing rural poverty in the state by
improving production among family farmers. This project aims to achieve that by
increasing the property and assets of beneficiary families by 20 per cent; reducing
child malnutrition by 25 per cent; and reducing the proportion of the family budget
used to buy food by 20 per cent. It will focus on 43 municipalities, including 4
inhabited by indigenous communities. The project will begin by strengthening
beneficiary capacities to participate in the local development process, better
manage their organizations, reduce gender inequalities and create opportunities for
young people. Then it will work to increase food production through technical
assistance, cofinancing investments in production, improving access to markets and
addressing adaptation to climate change.

CUBA: Livestock Cooperatives Development Project in the Central-Eastern
Region
This project is geared to increasing the production and sale of milk and meat, and
thus raising the incomes of families in cooperatives. At present, the cooperatives
have significant manual labour capacity, but due to insufficient equipment, inputs
and services they are experiencing high cattle mortality and low birth rates, as well
as having insufficient pasture land and limited water availability. The project will
work to strengthen these smallholder livestock cooperatives in both production and
managerial capacity. It will build the capacity of service providers, leading to an
increase in cow insemination, improved pastureland and the rehabilitation of water
capture infrastructure. The project also focuses on increasing the transport capacity
and the processing capacity of the milk and meat industries in the project area.

Though poverty has been declining in recent years, it increased slightly in 2014 due
to rising food costs and growing unemployment. El Salvador is also one of the most
climate change-vulnerable countries in the world. This programme aims to
sustainably increase the incomes and climate change resilience of poor rural
families in the central, eastern, paracentral and western regions of the country. The
initiative will begin with capacity-building for sustainable production adapted to
climate change. This will be done through research, outreach, education and
training focused on developing priority value chains. It will then promote
sustainable access to better markets for target groups (small producers, women,
young people and indigenous peoples) as a means to boost incomes. In addition,
the programme will work to strengthen the rural development policy and
institutional framework through support for policy analysis and formulation and
implementation activities relating to the selected value chains.

One of the causes of high poverty rates in rural areas of Peru is poor integration
with the market economy. This project aims to support the creation of rural
producers’ organizations to help communities improve their livelihood strategies
and increase their participation in markets for goods and services. It will begin by
building institutional capacities in the project’s seven provinces, including in local
and provincial governments, supporting initiatives to improve communal goods and
properties. It will also help the beneficiaries and their community and indigenous
associations to build their capacities for sustainable natural resource management
and development and deal with climate change. Deteriorating rural roads and
scarce communication services lead to isolation, so the project also aims to

Grants
IFAD uses grants to generate, test and implement innovative ideas and approaches
to agricultural and rural development, with partner governments and with civil
society organizations, research institutions, academia, private-sector actors and
other centres of excellence. The grant programme is an important instrument that
complements our investment programmes by promoting innovations, policy
engagement, research and partnerships. Since 1978, IFAD has committed
US$1,100.6 million in grants.
Following the approval of our Policy for Grant Financing and the accompanying
Implementing Procedures in 2015, 2016 was an important year as the new Policy
and Procedures became effective. According to the new policy, the goal of IFAD
grants is to broaden and add value to the support that the Fund provides to
smallholder farmers and rural transformation, thereby contributing to rural poverty
eradication, sustainable agricultural development, and global food security and
nutrition. Poor rural people and their organizations are central to every grant
submission.
At IFAD, we extend two types of grants, depending on the nature of the innovation
and the scope of intervention: global or regional grants, and country-specific
grants. In 2016, grants worth US$56.9 million were approved. This total is made up
of US$44.7 million in global and regional grants and US$12.2 million in country-
specific grants, including US$0.4 million for small grants under the debt
sustainability framework (DSF) (Table 12).
Grants for activities implemented in specific countries focus mainly on
strengthening institutional, implementation and policy capacities and on innovating
in thematic areas. Country-specific grants also pilot new technologies, approaches
and methodologies that can subsequently be scaled up through IFAD’s country
programmes and by other stakeholders.
Global and regional grants fund innovative responses to rural and agricultural
challenges being faced by several partner countries. These grants are driven by
thematic and regional corporate-level strategic priorities for partnership, research,
policy engagement and capacity-building. The priorities are determined within the
scope of IFAD’s three-year Medium-term Plan and further sharpened into priority
lines of action through an annual guidance note. As a result, IFAD allocates grant
resources strategically. In 2016, the areas of focus for global or regional grants
were:
•   rural youth and employment
•   rural financial inclusion
•   improved data collection and better results measurement
•   AR4D (agricultural research for development) to sustainably enhance the
    intensification and resilience of smallholder agriculture.
Another important change we introduced as a result of the new grants policy is a
move towards selecting grantees through competitive processes such as calls for
interest. This year, IFAD selected 14 grant recipients in this way. In addition, we
now strongly encourage grant recipients and other partners of IFAD grant-funded
projects to mobilize cofinancing to ensure greater ownership and better prospects

                                          76
-----------------------Page 79 End-----------------------

for scaling up results. In 2016, cofinancing mobilized by partners of IFAD grant-
funded projects was 1.39:1 for each dollar provided by IFAD. To improve efficiency
and effectiveness, we have also made an effort to approve fewer but larger new
grants. At the same time, the number of small grants (under US$0.5 million) is
being reduced, and in 2016 small grants made up only 8 per cent of the total grant
portfolio.

Stories from the field
New research finds the potential of waste reuse for small farmers
worldwide
By championing the possibilities of waste − food, agro-industrial and even human −
a grant funded by IFAD and the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation
(SDC) has supported food security and sustainability across the world. From 2011
to 2015, the Resource Recovery and Reuse project – implemented by the
International Water Management Institute (IWMI) under the CGIAR Water, Land
and Ecosystems research programme – analysed 110 waste-recovery businesses in
order to establish guidelines for assessing, implementing and scaling up similar
programmes. Now, the project’s findings are generating donor interest and
encouraging small businesses globally to take advantage of the water, nutrients
and energy found in waste.
The main innovation of the Resource Recovery and Reuse project was to
demonstrate that sanitation work and waste management − traditionally dependent
on public subsidies − can be profitable. Its research found that waste-reuse
businesses could increase cost recovery, generate profits and recover resources to
improve soil nutrition, crop sustainability and climate resilience.
For urban dwellers in developing countries, waste reuse businesses can provide
incentives to collect and process the 30 to 60 per cent of waste that remains
untreated by municipal services. For rural people − and smallholder farmers in
particular − these businesses create jobs and provide inputs such as organic
fertilizer that can boost food security and sustainable agriculture. Waste reuse

                                          80
-----------------------Page 83 End-----------------------

programmes also create a closed loop for rural-urban linkages: the water and
nutrients that enter urban areas through agricultural products can be returned to
rural areas through resource recovery.
The project analysed 60 empirical studies from 24 countries and developed
21 generic waste-reuse models with potential for implementation in developing
countries. The researchers then tested these models through feasibility studies in
Bangalore, Hanoi, Kampala and Lima and published their results in the public
domain (see: http://ifadrrr.iwmi.org/approved-project-documents.aspx). The
project provided financial support to more than 20 postgraduate students working
on related research questions, and its findings are continuing to guide investment
decisions in waste reuse businesses.
So far, the project has catalysed follow-up grants from the SDC and the European
Union worth over US$2.8 million, and CGIAR’s Water, Land and Ecosystems
programme has listed sustainable rural-urban linkages with a focus on recovering
and reusing resources in urbanized ecosystems as a flagship programme for further
funding and research. There are also plans to integrate business models from the
projects with business school curricula to instruct future leaders in resource
recovery and reuse.

The project’s findings are also fostering public-private partnerships. In Ghana,
Jekora Ventures Ltd is planning to establish a co-composting facility in the
Yilo-Krobo Municipal Assembly to annually transform 5,000 cubic metres of faecal
sludge and 300 tons of organic solid wastes into 200 tons of safe pelletized
compost. A wastewater treatment plant is planned in Kumasi to produce catfish in
well-treated wastewater and reinvest the profits in the maintenance of the plant.
Meanwhile, the project’s research has resulted in collaboration with the World
Bank’s Water and Sanitation Program to conduct feasibility assessments for
different waste reuse business models in Maharashtra and Kerala states in India.
The Government of Sri Lanka has signed a memorandum of understanding with
IWMI to pilot a waste-to-fertilizer facility in Kurunegala and analyse how to increase
cost recovery in its 110 compost stations across the country. The research findings
have also been incorporated into the government-led Market Gardening
Development Support Project that IFAD is supporting in Benin.


Better feed for cows benefits dairy farmers in India and Tanzania
Across the world, livestock provides food and income for almost 1.3 billion people.
Dairy cows are particularly important both nutritionally and economically. In India
and Tanzania, innovative feeding strategies – introduced by an IFAD grant – have
increased milk production and boosted small farmers’ food security and livelihoods.
From 2011 to 2014, IFAD funded a programme for enhancing dairy-based
livelihoods in India and Tanzania through feed innovation and value chain
development approaches. Better known as MilkIT, the programme was led by the
International Livestock Research Institute with the International Center for Tropical
Agriculture (CIAT) and partners. The programme connected poor dairy producers −
many of them women − to value chains and knowledge-sharing platforms to
improve feeding methods.
Some of the changes introduced were simple but significant. In India, for example,
feeding troughs helped farmers from seven villages cut down on waste. Initially,
only 1 per cent of participating farmers owned a trough. The rest put feed on the
ground, leading to high wastage of forage, more labour when cleaning out the
cattle sheds and increased risk of transmission of animal diseases.
With the help of local builders, MilkIT designed a simple trough using local material
and adapted to the needs of local producers. In order to promote the use of this
technology, the IFAD-funded Integrated Livelihood Support Project and the National
Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development provided financial incentives to project
participants, most of whom were women. This contributed to the adoption of the
new troughs, and as a result the average rate of fodder wastage fell by half.
Meanwhile, in Tanzania, MilkIT trained smallholder farmers in different methods of
feed production and conservation. Dairy farmers learned to use a box-baler to
make hay from natural grass or maize by-products. This inspired some farmers in
Mbuzii, a village in Lushoto district, to make their own baler, which they
demonstrated at a district agricultural show. Now, 40 farmers in Ubiri have adopted
the new technology.

The spread of the box-baler reflects another MilkIT component: setting up
innovation platforms in each country. Dialogue in these gathering centres led to
rapid improvement in marketing arrangements, such as establishing producer
cooperatives, milk collection centres and shops in Uttarakhand, India. Additionally,
the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development developed credit schemes
to enable small farmers to purchase cross-bred cows that produce more milk, and
the state dairy cooperative relaxed their membership rules to allow remote villages
to join and sell milk through them.
As MilkIT demonstrated, technical feed interventions and marketing interventions
are most effective when implemented together, as they depend on and support
each other’s success. For example, participants in the innovation platforms
identified that increasing the quantity of good quality feed depended on finding a
cheap, easy way to cut chaff and make it more palatable for the animals. After
smallholder dairy farmers tested forage choppers already available with local dairy
cooperatives, MilkIT identified an entrepreneur who was available to supply the



                                                   83
-----------------------Page 86 End-----------------------

chosen model in remote areas and facilitated the acquisition of such forage
choppers by groups of farmers. This enabled them to produce better, more plentiful
feed and thus increase milk production and incomes.
IFAD is looking at ways to scale up the successes of MilkIT. In Uttarakhand (India),
the findings may be implemented in the IFAD-supported Integrated Livelihood
Support Project. In Tanga (Tanzania), the lessons learned have been fed into the
national Maziwa Zaidi dairy development initiative linked to CGIAR’s livestock
research programme. The innovation platform process has been adopted by local
stakeholders and applied in other contexts.


Smallholders in Latin America find their voice with support from IFAD
Enabling rural people to have a say in the policies and decisions that affect their
lives and livelihoods is a key part of IFAD’s work to empower smallholders, poor
producers and rural entrepreneurs. Since 2010, we have partnered with the Latin
American Center for Rural Development (RIMISP) to create “rural dialogue groups”,
which work to give rural people a greater voice in policy debates.
Despite recent progress, the Latin American region continues to suffer from the
highest rates of inequality in the world. Rural people, in particular, struggle to
access the opportunities and benefits created by economic growth and social
development. Creating space for smallholders to take part in policy dialogue – and
building their confidence to do so – is vital to efforts to drive inclusive rural
development and to enable poor producers to adapt to the changing climate.
Farmers in El Salvador are very vulnerable to several effects of climate change,
including widespread soil erosion, land degradation and drought. The Corredor Seco
(Dry Corridor), for example, is home to 104 municipalities and thousands of small
farmers. It is severely affected by intense droughts that can last for weeks.
In 2010, to help combat these issues, an IFAD grant supported the creation of
El Salvador's Rural Dialogue Group. The group is led by 20-30 representatives of
various entities − including universities, international bodies, civil society
organizations and government − with vast experience in both rural development
and environmental issues. Together, they raise the level of political and social
dialogue within the country.
The Rural Dialogue Group focuses particularly on policies that enable farmers to
adapt to climate change and promote environmental protection within the context
of rural development. Since it works directly with the Ministries of Agriculture and
Rural Development, and Environment and Natural Resources, the group can raise
these issues directly with policymakers. Nutrition and food security and sovereignty
are also on the agenda.
In Colombia, the Rural Dialogue Group was instrumental in supporting the new
vision for the rural sector promoted through the peace negotiations with the FARC
guerrilla organization. The group was especially active in contributing to the Rural
Mission of Colombia. This is an initiative with a new institutional agenda for the
agrarian sector that aims to improve the situation in the rural areas, which have
been severely neglected during the 50 years of violent conflict that have ravaged
the country.

                                          84
-----------------------Page 87 End-----------------------

Led by 12 members from diverse backgrounds, including representatives of trade
and labour unions, multilateral organizations and universities, the Colombian group
is part of a larger movement attempting to bridge the gap between urban and rural
populations. Enabling small producers to participate fully in value chains and social
development, for example, could increase social mobility throughout the country.
With support from IFAD, the Colombian group helped create a virtual space for
communications called “The Rural Chair” (http://lasillavacia.com/silla-llena/red-
rural). This platform has been influential in shaping public opinion on topics related
to technological investment for smallholder farmers, improved seeds, land
ownership, water scarcity and climate change, among other issues.
The Rural Dialogue Group also supported the preparation of IFAD’s new RB-COSOP
for Colombia, endorsed by the Executive Board in December. The group contributed
with political guidance and technical advice that greatly improved the programme.
In Colombia, two local subgroups were also created. The Caribbean subgroup
helped formulate guidelines for a rural development strategy with a territorial
approach in the region. In partnership with the School of Public Administration, the
group held 22 workshops in 21 subregions to enable local people to actively
contribute to plans and processes for rural and territorial development. In the
Atlantic region, the subgroup worked directly with the government to create
territorial innovation systems to stimulate development.

Organics offer new opportunities to young farmers in the Pacific Islands
A growing IFAD-supported movement in the Pacific Islands is helping farmers tap
into international organics markets. By having their products certified as organic,
Pacific Island farmers are raising their incomes, increasing their resilience and
maintaining their cultures.
In the Pacific Islands, farmers have been using organic farming methods for
centuries, without the application of chemical fertilizers, pesticides and herbicides.
But strict international requirements for organic products prevented traditional
producers from exporting their goods and benefiting from lucrative overseas
markets.
To enable farmers to access these markets, IFAD provided financial support to the
Secretariat of the Pacific Community to fund the Pacific Organic and Ethical Trade
Community (POETCom). POETCom sees organics and ethical trade as a key
contributor to sustaining culture and communities, and improving farmers’
livelihoods, people’s health and the environment in the Pacific. It seeks to grow the
organic and ethical trade movement and foster a productive, resilient, sustainable
and healthy Pacific Island region.

-----------------------Page 89 End-----------------------

Since 2014, POETCom has signed agreements with three internationally accredited
certifying bodies to create the Pacific Organic Standard (POS). By meeting this
standard, smallholders have scaled up their businesses and increased their
incomes. With the help of POETCom, by 2015, 19,000 smallholder farmers had
gained certification and 70,000 hectares of lands were under organic production.
As the international market for organics continues to grow, it presents increasing
opportunities for small Pacific farmers who are usually too remote to participate in
other mainstream markets. Through POETCom, farmers have been able to access
growing markets for virgin coconut oil, coconut sugar and papaya in order to sell
their products at premium prices.
Because POETCom encourages Pacific farmers to take full advantage of their
traditional farming practices, POETCom and IFAD have worked in partnership with
national organic farming organizations to give institutional support to smallholder
farmers and upgrade their technical skills. Using a mentorship approach, farmers
are able to share their skills and experience with their peers, including techniques
that maintain the farmers’ traditional relationships with the land. Young farmers are
equipped with critical production and marketing skills to promote self-employment
and economic expansion.
At the same time, POETCom and IFAD are helping young farmers build resilience to
global warming. Smallholders in the Pacific are particularly vulnerable to the effects
of climate change and natural hazards. These can include cyclones, earthquakes,
tsunamis, volcanic eruptions, drought, salinity intrusion and extreme flooding. The
programme has been designed to help small producers protect their livelihoods.
