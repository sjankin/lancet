Abstract
The WHO Regional Office for Europe supports Member States in providing people with sustainable
access to essential and affordable high-quality medicines and medical products. The Access to
Medicines and Health Products (AMP) programme focuses on health system strengthening, supporting
the development, revision and implementation of comprehensive pharmaceutical sector policies
covering regulation of medicines and medical devices, pharmacovigilance, selection and responsible
use of medicines, expanding the use of health technology assessment, and developing medicine pricing
and reimbursement policies. The programme also has an important convening role, bringing together
international experts to promote cross-country/area dialogue and share country/area experiences. The
COVID-19 pandemic has focused attention on weaknesses and vulnerabilities in health-care systems.
These weaknesses have reinforced the importance of health system strengthening to provide safe,
quality, affordable medicines and health-care products. The 2020 annual report of the Access to
Medicines and Health Products (AMP) programme highlights some of the work done by the Regional
Office in collaboration with agencies and partners.

Message from the Director
The COVID-19 pandemic inevitably affected
planned work in 2020, with many country/
area-based activities, workshops and opportunities
for information-sharing cancelled or postponed.
COVID-19 also focused attention on weaknesses
and vulnerabilities in health-care systems. These
weaknesses have reinforced the importance of
health system strengthening to build robust, resilient
and evidence-informed systems.
The European Programme of Work, 2020–2025
“United Action for Better Health in Europe” (EPW),
recognizes health system strengthening as being
central to moving towards universal health coverage,
protecting against health emergencies, and
promoting health and well-being for all. Affordable
access to medicines and health products for all is
a priority under the EPW. Out-of-pocket costs of
medicines and health products are of concern in
Europe, acting as a barrier to access, generating
unmet health needs and leading to financial
hardship for many. Addressing medicine costs,
including transparency in medicines pricing, is
important in tackling access to medicines.
Work undertaken in conjunction with European
experts in 2020 provides a strong platform for
our ongoing efforts. The Oslo Medicines Initiative,
supported by the Norwegian Ministry of Health
and Care Services and the Norwegian Medicines
Agency, will provide a platform for the public and
private sectors jointly to outline a vision for equitable

and sustainable access to effective, innovative and
affordable medicines. The WHO Regional Office for
Europe will have an important leadership role in this
initiative.
I welcome this report of the work of the Access to
Medicines and Health Products (AMP) programme
team in 2020. With its technical expertise and
practical experiences in pharmaceutical regulation,
procurement and supply, prescribing, dispensing
and appropriate use of medicines, the AMP team is
well placed to support the agenda of health system
strengthening and assisting Member States in
strengthening their pharmaceutical systems.
Collaborations across and beyond WHO are
critical to delivering our programmes. We look
forward to ongoing and effective partnerships
with Member States, United Nations agencies and
nongovernmental organizations as we address
diverse challenges in the pharmaceutical sector,
from improving access to high-priced medicines,
to reducing out-of-pocket costs, limiting the
circulation of substandard and falsified products,
and promoting the responsible use of antibiotics.
Our aim is to ensure that high-quality and affordable
medicines and health technologies are available to
all citizens of the WHO European Region.

ANNUAL REPORT 2020

1

Introduction
The WHO Regional Director for Europe, Dr Hans
Henri P. Kluge, took office in February 2020,
launching the strategic directions for the WHO
Regional Office for Europe and the European
Programme of Work, 2020–2025 – “United Action
for Better Health in Europe” (EPW) (1). This led to a
reorganization of units within the Regional Office to
align with the EPW.
The former Health Technologies and
Pharmaceutical (HTP) programme was renamed
the Access to Medicines and Health Products (AMP)
programme and is part of the Division of Country
Health Policies and Systems. The director of the
division is Dr Natasha Azzopardi Muscat.

Access to Medicines and Health
Products (AMP) programme
AMP realizes the objectives of the EPW by focusing
on health system strengthening through:
•	 supporting the development, revision
and implementation of comprehensive
pharmaceutical sector policies covering the
regulation of medicines and medical devices;
•	 promoting the judicious selection and
responsible use of medicines;
•	 expanding the use of health technology
assessment (HTA); and
•	 developing medicine pricing and
reimbursement policies.
The AMP undertakes a mix of country/areaspecific, subregional and regional initiatives.

Where appropriate, AMP plays a convening role,
bringing together national and international
experts and colleagues to promote
cross-country/area dialogue and share
country/area experiences.
The EPW establishes the following thematic
priorities for AMP:
•	 ensuring access for all to medicines, vaccines
and health products;
•	 improving governance and stewardship in the
pharmaceutical sector;
•	 supporting country/area preparedness and
response capacity for medicines and health
products in emergency situations;
•	 improving patient safety and tackling
antimicrobial resistance; and
•	 supporting EPW flagship initiatives.

Impact of the COVID-19
pandemic
The COVID-19 pandemic necessitated changes to
planned face-to-face country activities, regional
meetings and workshops in 2020. AMP support
to countries/areas in the European Region
continued, with resources and activities directed
towards supporting emergency responses and
strengthening country/area capacity for access
to essential medicines and health products in the
face of disrupted supply chains, shortages of some
medicines and demands for specific medicines and
health technologies.

ACCESS TO MEDICINES AND HEALTH PRODUCTS PROGRAMME

About the AMP programme
WHO describes the value chain of a medicine,
identifying steps along the pathway from identification
of a new chemical entity to its use in clinical practice
(Fig. 1). Access to medicines and health products
requires attention at all steps along this path.
Through the AMP and other programmes, the
Regional Office supports countries/areas in their
development of policies and guidance for selection
and use of medicines and medical products. AMP
provides direct technical assistance to countries/areas
and supports networking and collaboration between
them to improve access to quality, affordable essential
medicines and promote their responsible use.
The aims and objectives of the AMP programme
cover three strategic areas:
1.	 policies and regulation to ensure the quality,
safety and efficacy of health products;
2.	 medicines and health products selection that will
improve equitable and affordable access; and
3.	 data and information to understand and
improve the responsible use of medicines
and health technologies.

Under the umbrella of health system strengthening,
AMP focuses on the development, revision and
implementation of comprehensive pharmaceutical
sector policies covering:
•	 regulation of medicines and medical devices;
•	 good governance in the pharmaceutical
sector;
•	 efficient procurement and supply-chain
management to ensure the quality of
medicines and health technologies
in circulation;
•	 pharmacovigilance;
•	 evidence-based selection of medicines and
fair and affordable pricing;
•	 expanded use of HTA;
•	 medicine pricing and reimbursement policies;
and
•	 data analysis on medicines consumption
and use to promote the responsible use of
antimicrobial medicines.

ANNUAL REPORT 2020

The EPW
The EPW, approved by Member States in 2020, sets
out regional health priorities and the framework for
Regional Office activities (1). EPW core priorities are:
1. moving towards universal health coverage (UHC)
2. protecting against health emergencies
3. promoting health and well-being.
Supporting Member State efforts to ensure access
for all to medicines, vaccines and health products will
involve identifying and supporting the correction of
vulnerabilities in regulatory procedures, production,
procurement and supply chains.
Implementing the EPW requires a reconsideration
of current interactions through which patients,
health systems and governments can access
affordable pharmaceuticals that meet their needs,
while investors and the pharmaceutical industry are
rewarded sufficiently for developing or manufacturing
those medicines. WHO will have an important role
in convening stakeholders to discuss their
roles and responsibilities.

The high costs of medicines pose a significant
barrier to access, cause inequities within and
among Member States, and lead to unacceptable
levels of out-of-pocket expenditure in countries/
areas across all income levels. In May 2019,
Member States endorsed World Health Assembly
resolution WHA72.8 on improving the transparency
of markets for medicines, vaccines and other
health products (3). The EPW recognizes the
importance of accelerating implementation
of WHA72.8 to improve access to high-priced
innovative medicines and vaccines. This will
be done by strengthening information systems,
expanding voluntary intercountry/area collaborative
platforms and supranational procurement groups,
and developing technical options for fair pricing.
The Regional Office has worked with stakeholders to
discuss challenges in access to innovative,
high-value medicines in Europe and form proposals for
the Regional Office’s contribution to implementation
of resolution WHA72.8. Experts from health ministries,
insurance institutions and academia from Austria,
Belgium, Malta, Norway, Switzerland and the United
Kingdom, as well as European experts from a range of
institutional backgrounds and representatives from the

Medicines Agency (5). It aims to provide a platform
for the public and private sectors jointly to outline a
vision for equitable and sustainable access to effective,
innovative and affordable medicines. The challenge
is to ensure wider access to affordable medicines
while maintaining commercial viability for medicine
producers. Achieving this will require greater solidarity,
transparency and coherence between the public and
private sectors and a commitment to sustainability.

COVID-19-related activities
AMP supported the development of several
technical documents providing guidance to national
agencies related to the COVID-19 pandemic. AMP
staff were co-opted to the WHO Health Emergencies
Response team.

Supply management
The COVID-19 Supply Chain System was established
to streamline procurement and increase efficiencies
in the distribution of 58 critical products (6). A
technical document was developed to support
national authorities facing interrupted supplies
of medicines and health technologies during the
COVID-19 pandemic (7). AMP supported several
Member States in local procurement of personal
protective equipment (PPE), diagnostics and
medical equipment.
Minimum criteria for procurement were developed
for procurement and supply management (PSM)
agencies. Guidance focused on prioritization,
legislation, registration and marketing
authorization, procurement, distribution and
management of shortages. WHO headquarters,
the Regional Office and the United Nations
Children’s Fund (UNICEF) are codeveloping a
module on the resilience of PSM systems in
cases of emergency.

Preparedness to deploy
COVID-19 vaccines
Guidance on deployment and vaccination
planning supports countries/areas in developing
their plans for the introduction of COVID-19
vaccines (8). WHO is working to ensure that
national regulatory authorities (NRAs) have
procedures and pathways for emergency
approvals, and can facilitate importation of
vaccines, expedite lot release of COVID-19

vaccines and make provision for traceability of
vaccines in their health-care systems.

Use of experimental
medicines
Technical advice was developed to address
questions from Member States regarding the use
of experimental medicines in the treatment of
COVID-19 patients (9). The document provides WHO
recommendations for the treatment of COVID-19
patients, and information on the ethical and legal
requirements for the clinical-trial use of experimental
medicines and donated medicines.

Pharmacy services
Pharmacists are likely to have had an enhanced role
during the COVID-19 pandemic, with people who
are unwell visiting pharmacies first for professional
advice on symptom management and treatments
for existing conditions. Technical guidance was
developed to support pharmacists to provide safe,
high-quality services in community pharmacy
settings (10).

ACCESS TO MEDICINES AND HEALTH PRODUCTS PROGRAMME

Examples of country support
Azerbaijan
At the request of the First Vice-President of
Azerbaijan, WHO sent a team of experts to provide
recommendations and support response-planning
for the COVID-19 pandemic. AMP supported this
mission, focusing on activities to ensure access to
medicines and health products for the prevention
and treatment of COVID-19 infection.

Georgia
AMP participated in a high-level advocacy meeting
to discuss planned reforms in the pharmaceutical
sector to address issues that included gaps in
health insurance coverage and high out-of-pocket
costs. Mapping of the pharmaceutical system and
institutions was undertaken. Challenges in the
reform process were discussed and measures to
address concerns identified.

Romania
A review of procurement of tuberculosis medicines
and diagnostics identified problems with the
licensing of medicines, no centralized stock of
medicines or forecasting mechanism, and high
prices. Procurement legislation was reviewed.
A PSM consultant developed a simple stockmanagement tool, provided training on its use and
supported its implementation in six regions. 

Tajikistan
Tajikistan does not have a system for monitoring
medicine prices at any level of the health-care
system. A MedMon (11) survey was conducted in
response to concerns about access to essential

medicines amid the COVID-19 crisis. A customized
MedMon platform was developed and training
of data collectors undertaken in 2020, with data
collection in community pharmacies carried out
in early 2021.

Turkey
A mission was undertaken to review progress in
the development of the NRA self-benchmarking
report and the institutional development plan. The
review showed good progress in the implementation
of planned improvements to the NRA. Formal
benchmarking, planned for 14–18 September, was
postponed due to the epidemiological situation.

Turkmenistan
Poor management of noncommunicable diseases
contributes to high premature mortality rates.
AMP is supporting the Ministry of Health to revise
the national medicines policy, review the National
Essential Medicines List and its concordance with
WHO Model Lists and alignment with approved
clinical protocols and guidelines, and evaluate
quantification mechanisms to ensure adequate
procurement of medicines for noncommunicable
diseases.

Uzbekistan
WHO has been working with the Ministry of Health
to analyse data from a pilot site (Syrdarya region)
on current spending on medicines. A customized
MedMon survey has been developed to provide
baseline data on availability and prices of essential
medicines in community pharmacies. Training for
data collectors and data collection are planned for
early 2021.

ACCESS TO MEDICINES AND HEALTH PRODUCTS PROGRAMME

Medicine regulation and quality
Regulation primarily is concerned with enabling
patient access to quality, safe and effective
medicines and medical devices. A strong regulatory
system builds confidence in the quality of products
in circulation and protects from exposure to
substandard and falsified (SF) products. Some
countries in the WHO European Region are governed
by European Union (EU) rules on the regulation
of medicines and health products, while smaller
countries and areas outside the EU use a mix
of national regulatory procedures and reliance
on regulatory assessments conducted by other
Member States.

Regulatory system
strengthening
•	 AMP has supported countries/areas in the
Region undertaking self-benchmarking as
part of formal assessment of their regulatory
systems using the WHO Global Benchmarking
Tool. Several have formulated an institutional
development plan to build on strengths and
address gaps identified in their systems.
•	 The prequalification team’s virtual online
medicines quality-assessment training
focused on the assessment of a generic
product dossier (active pharmaceutical
ingredients and finished products) and
covered the topics of bioequivalence and
biowaivers. The training targeted regulators
from NRAs in emerging markets and
quality assessors.
•	 The eighth annual meeting on the
collaborative registration procedure (CRP)
was conducted online in 2020. Participants
from Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia,
Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Ukraine and
Uzbekistan presented their achievements and
challenges regarding the CRP and addressed
questions from those yet formally to join the
CRP process.

•	 Updated WHO guidelines on good storage
and distribution practices for medical
products were published in 2020 (13). The
term good storage and distribution practices
replaces the previously used good distribution
practices. The guidelines assist in ensuring
the quality and identity of health products
during all aspects of the distribution process,
including procurement, purchasing, storage,
transportation, repackaging, relabelling,
documentation and record-keeping.
•	 AMP and the Regional Office participated
in a virtual meeting with coordinators
of national tuberculosis programmes to
share information about the WHO CRP for
medicines and experiences in the application
of CRP for tuberculosis in Kyrgyzstan and
Ukraine.
•	 A WHO examination training course was
conducted on strengthening country/
area-adapted active tuberculosis drugsafety monitoring and management
systems and their alignment with national
pharmacovigilance. The course covered the
concepts of pharmacovigilance, and adverse
drug reactions and adverse events following
immunization, with analysis of the clinical
management of cases of each. Participants
were drawn from the tuberculosis, HIV,
hepatitis and immunization programmes and
NRAs in Azerbaijan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan
and Uzbekistan.

Substandard and falsified (SF) products
Substandard products (also called out of
specification) are authorized medical products
that fail to meet either their quality standards or
specifications, or both. Falsified medical products
are those that deliberately/fraudulently misrepresent
their identity, composition or source.
SF medical products pose an unacceptable risk
to public health, are in circulation in every region
of the world and affect products of all types,
including generic and innovator brands, vaccines
and diagnostics. The COVID-19 pandemic has
exacerbated problems, with seizures of SF products
occurring as countries/areas compete for access to
medicines, vaccines and PPE globally (14). The need
to address SF has been highlighted in the EPW.
The WHO European Region is bordered by
several countries that are major manufacturers
of pharmaceuticals and known-source countries
of SF medical products (15). The key component
to preventing, detecting and responding to SF is a
transparent NRA that is appropriately resourced in
terms of finance, staff and equipment.
The WHO Global Surveillance and Monitoring
System (GSMS) is a structured reporting system
that allows a fast response to emergencies and the
issuing of global/regional alerts in the most serious
cases of SF products. The GSMS is only as good
as the reports it receives and is best supported
by regional networks. While EU countries actively
participate, non-EU countries/areas in the European
Region report SF medical products only sporadically
to the GSMS.
In response, AMP commissioned a review
and action plan to advance the agenda on SF
products, particularly in the non-EU part of the
European Region. Specifically, AMP will initiate
work in selected WHO Member States to increase
government and public awareness of the problems
of SF products. The countries/areas involved will
be encouraged to participate in the Member State
Mechanism, fostering international cooperation
and information exchange on, for example, good

manufacturing practices (and good storage and
distribution practices) inspection reports. A limited
medicine-quality survey conducted in accordance
with established guidelines is a proven method of
establishing a benchmark against which to measure
progress. Opportunities for a subregional network
for non-EU countries/areas will be explored.

Blood products
In 2020, WHO launched its action framework to
advance universal access to safe, effective and
quality-assured blood products 2020–2023 (16),
with six key objectives:
•	 appropriately structured, well coordinated
and sustainably resourced national blood
systems;
•	 regulatory capacity to ensure the quality and
safety of blood;
•	 functioning and efficiently managed blood
services;
•	 effective implementation of patient blood
management to optimize transfusion
practices;
•	 effective surveillance, haemovigilance
and pharmacovigilance, supported by
comprehensive and accurate data-collection
systems; and
•	 partnerships, collaboration and information
exchange to achieve key priorities and jointly
address challenges and emerging threats at
global, regional and national levels.
Some European countries, mainly EU and
other high-income states, have been assessed
as meeting the standards of the WHO Global

and/or paid donors and private blood banks.
This can lead to high levels of wastage of
donations during collection, processing and
testing, and due to expiry. Even the status of
blood varies: it is classed as a medicine in some
countries/areas and specifically excluded from
classification as a medicines or medicines
product in others.
In 2020, AMP commissioned a review and action
plan to consider the global action framework in
the context of the European Region and support
its implementation. AMP will work to increase
awareness of the WHO Global Benchmarking
Tool + Blood and WHO action framework on
blood products and, where appropriate, support
Member States to develop the regulatory
framework for a national blood service.

AMP will enhance opportunities for collaboration
between Member States in sharing information
and expertise to advance universal access
to safe, effective and quality-assured
blood products.

Procurement and supply management
Ensuring access for all to medicines, vaccines
and health products is identified as a priority in
the EPW. Efficient PSM facilitates the purchase
of quality products at best prices, ensures
adequate and timely supply and minimizes
stockouts and shortages.

PSM strengthening for
transitioning countries/areas
Global Fund systems using international
procurement procedures have facilitated access
to quality-assured medicines for the treatment of
HIV and tuberculosis in low- and middle-income
countries/areas globally. The transition of several
middle-income countries/areas in the European
Region from Global Fund to national procurement
has focused attention on the need to upgrade
national PSM systems to avoid disruptions to
service delivery and ensure access to treatment.
This may require changes to laws, regulations
and procedures, capacity-building for agencies,
and allocation of sufficient funds for purchases of
medicines and health products.
AMP works with other WHO teams to support
transition efforts through the CRP, strengthening
of national regulatory agencies, prequalification of
medicines and health products, promotion of good
manufacturing practices and support for pricing and
reimbursement policies.

Assessing PSM systems in the
European Region
In 2020, AMP worked with UNICEF to assess PSM
systems in Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakhstan, the
Republic of Moldova and Uzbekistan, with the
support of a grant from the Global Fund for Access
to Medicines and Health Products. The UNICEF
supply-chain maturity model measures performance

and capability of national supply chains for essential
medicines or any other health commodity across
a maturity framework that ranges from level 1
(minimum development and performance) to
level 5 (fully developed, integrated and excellent
performance) (12). These assessments identify gaps
and priorities across the supply chain and allow
tracking of progress as countries reform, develop
recommendations and improve their systems.
A separate assessment of the CPA in Ukraine was
undertaken by the WHO Country Office in Ukraine
using the WHO Model Quality Assurance System
for Procurement Agencies. The tool assesses the
quality-assurance requirements for procurement
across six domains – general requirements,
prequalification, purchasing, reception and storage,
distribution and reassessment. A preliminary report
outlines findings across some domains. A capacity
improvement plan has been drafted to address
key gaps.

Assistive technologies for
hearing, mobility and vision
Tajikistan developed its first list of essential assistive
products for older people and people with disabilities
in 2018. The list of 30 products was based on the
WHO Priority Assistive Products List and was the
result of a consultative, consensus-driven process
involving representatives from the Ministry of Health

-----------------------Page 19 End-----------------------

ACCESS TO MEDICINES AND HEALTH PRODUCTS PROGRAMME

and Social Protection and stakeholders that included
the Government, donor agencies, nongovernmental
organizations, disabled people’s organizations and
users of assistive technologies (AT). The three main
barriers to access to ATs in Tajikistan were found
to be affordability, lack of awareness and lack of
availability at community level (17).
To support WHO’s work to improve access and
affordability of ATs for hearing, mobility and vision,
an intern with the AMP programme conducted a
mapping of AT manufacturers and wholesalers in
nine countries of the WHO European Region and in
Kosovo.1 The desk review collated information on
sources of hearing aids, wheelchairs, spectacles
and prosthetics in four low-middle-income countries
(Azerbaijan, Georgia, Tajikistan and Ukraine) and
in Kosovo,1 and in five high-income countries
(Denmark, France, Germany, Malta and the United
Kingdom).

Most of the high-income countries maintained
national databases with information on companies
supplying ATs, typically manufacturing companies.
In contrast, it was often difficult to find information
on suppliers in low-middle-income countries and
in Kosovo;1 these mostly were local distributors
or retailers of imported products rather than
local manufacturers. In total, the review identified
429 companies across the nine countries and
Kosovo,1 primarily wheelchair and prosthetic
companies.
The results of the mapping exercise will be used by
UNICEF and WHO to inform a joint UNICEF–WHO
tender for ATs and an international joint meeting
for global AT companies. Placing priority ATs in
UNICEF and WHO supply catalogues will facilitate
Member States’ procurement of affordable and
high-quality products for their populations. The first
joint UNICEF–WHO tender, to be launched in the
first quarter 2021, will focus on hearing aids
and wheelchairs.

Access to medicines and
health products
Evidence-based selection and efficient introduction
of medical products into country/area health-care
systems are key to controlling public pharmaceutical
expenditure and balancing spending in public
health while remaining aware of neglected and
orphan diseases.

Electronic WHO Model Lists of
Essential Medicines
Essential medicines are those that satisfy the
priority health-care needs of the population and
should be selected with due regard to public
health relevance, evidence on efficacy and safety,
and comparative cost–effectiveness. Essential
medicines of assured quality should always be
available in a functioning health system at prices
individuals and the community can afford.
AMP has made available Russian-language
summaries of key changes to the 2019 WHO Model
Lists, including the 2019 update of the Access,
Watch and Reserve (AWaRe) classification of
antibiotics. A Russian-language version of WHO
guidance on selection of essential medicines at
country level has also been published (18). Support
is provided to Member States on revisions to
national lists.
A digital version of the WHO Model List of Essential
Medicines was launched in 2020, allowing computer
and smartphone access to a comprehensive online
database of information on essential medicines. The
electronic WHO Model List of Essential Medicines
can be adopted or adapted for national lists.  

WHO MedMon
The WHO MedMon tool is used to rapidly collect
and analyse data on the availability and prices of
medicines in health facilities and procurement

centres. In collaboration with the WHO Health
Emergencies Programme, it was adapted in 2020
to rapidly assess access to priority medicines and
health products needed for the COVID-19 pandemic.
In Tajikistan, the MedMon app was customized
for a community pharmacy survey conducted to
respond to the public’s concern about access to
essential medicines amid the COVID-19 crisis.
A MedMon survey is being used to provide baseline
data of availability and prices of essential medicines
in community pharmacies in Uzbekistan and results
will complement the situation analysis being done
for the State Health Insurance project. MedMon
offers a regular monitoring tool for availability
and prices of medicines in both Tajikistan and
Uzbekistan.

Cross-country collaborations
to improve access to medicines
and vaccines in the European
Region
An analysis of five government-led, voluntary,
cross-country initiatives – the Baltic Procurement
Initiative, the Beneluxa Initiative, Fair and Affordable
Pricing, the Nordic Pharmaceutical Forum and the
Valletta Declaration – has been conducted (19).
Joint activities focused on information-sharing,
HTA, horizon-scanning, joint pricing/reimbursement
negotiations and joint procurement of medicines.
Challenges to successful collaboration included the
resources required, different languages, dissimilar
organizational and legal frameworks, and industry
reluctance to engage in joint negotiations. Facilitating
factors included political support, trust within the
collaboration, commitment of the technical experts
involved, similarities between health-care systems
and the leadership of a dedicated person. A checklist
of prerequisites for successful cross-country
collaborations has been developed.

ACCESS TO MEDICINES AND HEALTH PRODUCTS PROGRAMME

Pricing and reimbursement
Pharmaceuticals remain the most important
component of out-of-pocket payments for health in
countries/areas in the WHO European Region (20).
Affordable and fair pricing and effective financing
schemes are integral to the achievement of UHC
and the Sustainable Development Goals, and are in
line with the EPW priority to ensure access for all to
medicines, vaccines and health products.

Pharmaceutical pricing and
reimbursement information
(PPRI) eastern Europe and
central Asia (EECA) network
A relaunch of the PPRI EECA network Armenia,
Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan,
Kyrgyzstan, the Republic of Moldova, the Russian
Federation, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine,
and Uzbekistan was conducted online in 2020
with support from the WHO Collaborating Centre
for Pharmaceutical Pricing and Reimbursement
Policies. The network is an information-sharing
initiative on pharmaceutical policies related to
pricing and reimbursement from a public health
perspective. The meeting introduced the network
and included an update on previous and ongoing
work. Challenges to pharmaceutical policies during
the COVID-19 pandemic and measures to address
the challenges were discussed. Several PPRI EECA
indicators were presented for consideration by
network members.

WHO guideline on country
pharmaceutical pricing policies
A revised WHO pharmaceutical pricing policies
guideline (2020) has updated the literature, evidence
and incorporated country experiences on managing

the prices of pharmaceutical products (21). The
guideline identifies eight overarching principles
for pricing policies and provides specific
recommendations for 10 policies countries/areas
may choose and adapt according to the objectives
and structure of their health systems.
While most recommendations are defined as
“conditional”, reflecting a limited evidence base,
a “strong” recommendation is made in favour
of promoting the use of quality-assured generic
and biosimilar medicines. There is a “conditional”
recommendation for promoting price transparency
through clear description of pricing approaches
and their technical requirements. Mechanisms for
increasing transparency include:
•	 sharing the net transaction prices of
pharmaceutical products with relevant
stakeholders;
•	 disclosing prices along the supply and
distribution chain;
•	 reporting research and development
contributions from all sources; and
•	 communicating pricing and reimbursement
decisions to the public.

Price regulation in Kyrgyzstan
Facilitated by the national professional officer, WHO
provided technical assistance to the Ministry of
Health on piloting a new government decree that
introduced price controls for selected medicines
included in the universal benefits package. The pilot
exposed weaknesses in regulation and problems in
collecting reliable information from manufacturers
and distributors. In response, WHO convened policy
dialogues with stakeholders to try to find consensus
on mechanisms to improve the sharing of price
data. This process informed amendments to the
regulation that are pending approval. Ownership of,

for Kosovo2 was conducted to share experiences
of the use of HTA to support decision-making.
International groups working in HTA and WHO
headquarters supported the workshop. HTAs that
had been conducted generally were limited to
assessments of clinical evidence. Barriers to HTA
use were identified as a lack of qualified staff, no
HTA agency, no legislation supporting the use of
HTA and limited budgets for HTA assessments (22).
Ongoing discussions with HTA experts will inform
programme development for further workshops and
identify opportunities for regional collaboration.
and commitment to, the next round of piloting by the
Ministry of Health will be critical to the successful
implementation of the pricing regulation.

Health technology
assessment
HTA refers to the systematic evaluation of
properties, effects and/or impacts of a health
technology. The HTA approach informs decisions
by making the trade-offs between benefits and
costs more explicit, and aids decisions on how best
to allocate limited funds to health interventions
and technologies. In high-income countries, HTA
is used to support subsidization decisions for
expensive medicines. HTA principles, such as
transparency and conflict of interest management,
are also important for decisions on selecting
medicines for inclusion in nascent health insurance
benefits packages in low- and middle-income
countries/areas.

HTA procedure approved in Ukraine
The Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine approved the
state HTA procedure in December 2020 (through
Decree No. 1300). The decree mandates HTA
assessments of all medicines for public coverage
with the conclusions of the assessments shared as
advice with the Ministry of Health.
Annexes to the decree include application forms for
HTA, HTA dossier requirements for submissions,
and requirements for HTA reports to provide clear,
structured and transparent processes for all HTA
stakeholders. An agency to conduct the HTAs will be
created in Ukraine.

WHO Europe Antimicrobial Medicines
Consumption Network
AMP continues to support the WHO Europe
Antimicrobial Medicines Consumption (AMC)
Network in data collection and analysis. As well as
disseminating the findings of quantitative analyses,
countries/areas are undertaking studies to better
understand how antibiotics are used in practice.

Joint publication of the
European Centre for Disease
Prevention and Control and the
WHO Regional Office for Europe
A joint publication comparing European Surveillance
of Antibiotic Consumption network (ESAC-Net)
and Regional Office AMC data for 2014–2018
was submitted for publication in December 2020.
Analyses apply key metrics of consumption and
the 2019 updates to defined daily doses (DDDs)
and the WHO AWaRe classification. While total
consumption was similar in the two networks,
the composition of agents varied substantially,
underlining the importance of a set of measures to
better understand how antibiotics are consumed.
The findings can facilitate development of Europewide strategies to improve the use of antibiotics and
address antimicrobial resistance.

Third report of the AMC
Network: AMC data 2014–2018
This report analyses AMC data for 18 participating
countries and for Kosovo3 in which the ministries
of health and/or public health authorities approved
data-sharing and publication. National, crossnational and area analyses include trends over
time (2014–2018) for key metrics of antibacterial
consumption, the WHO national monitoring target
of at least 60% of total consumption being Access

agents, and the drug utilization 75% (DU75%), which
represents the antibacterial substances accounting
for 75% of the consumption measured in DDD.

Antimicrobials supplied in
community pharmacies
A master protocol was developed by AMP for a
study to assess patterns of supply of antiviral and
antibacterial agents in community pharmacies
during the COVID-19 pandemic. For one week,
pharmacists from a random sample of pharmacies
in countries’/areas’ capital cities and in up to five
regions were asked to record information on
patients’ ages and genders, antimicrobials supplied,
formulation (oral, injectable) and, where possible,
reason(s) for supply. The protocol was approved
by the WHO Human Research Ethics Committee
(HREC) and adapted for use in nine AMC Network
countries and in Kosovo3. National and crossnational and area reports are being prepared.

Access to antibiotics without
prescription
AMP developed a study protocol that used simulated
patients with concealed identities to assess the
proportion of over-the-counter antibiotic requests
or consultations for advice from community
pharmacists that result in the sale of an antibiotic
without a prescription from a medical practitioner. In
addition to finding out which antibiotics are sold, the
study sought information on whether the client was
advised on how to take the medicine and whether
possible side-effects were discussed. Two members
of the AMC network, Armenia and Kosovo3,
undertook studies using the WHO HREC-approved
protocol and reported results in 2020. Country/area
summary reports are being prepared.
