Message from
the President


It is incredible to think that 60 years ago, when the
IDB was born, one in three people in our region
could not read. The average life expectancy was
just 57 years, and tens of millions of people lacked
access to essential services.
     Since then, Latin American and Caribbean
countries have made historic progress in almost
all areas of development. At the IDB, which has
financed thousands of projects that have helped
reduce poverty and improve the quality of peo-
ple’s lives, we are proud of what has been achieved
over the years.
     But we are also very aware of the great gap that still exists between the
aspirations of the people we serve and the reality they face every day. The
social protests experienced by several of the region’s countries in 2019 have
diverse and complex causes that range from demands for better wages to
outrage over corruption. But underlying all these protests is a sense of frus-
tration over a lack of equal opportunity.
     The intensity of the unrest might have surprised the founders of the IDB.
It is clear that Latin American and Caribbean citizens no longer base their ex-
pectations on their parents’ experiences, but instead, on the experiences of
their peers in more successful countries.
     That is the challenge facing the IDB: just as the IDB was born 60 years ago
with the mission of accelerating growth and regional integration, today our
duty is to help our countries address the changing demands of their people
and build more prosperous, sustainable and inclusive societies.
     That challenge is even greater in a highly complex global context, marked
by geopolitical tension, and amid a stagnant regional economy that is already
eroding progress made against poverty. But the biggest risk resides in the
possibility that, if we don’t find ways to meet widespread demands, we could
face even greater turbulence in the near future.
     Last September, at the Bank’s 60th anniversary celebration in Washington,
D.C., we discussed this challenge with Governors and representatives from
across the region. We know that we have a duty to think and act boldly.




                                       IDB ANNUAL REPORT 2019                      1
-----------------------Page 7 End-----------------------

        We also know that to meet our challenge, the region needs a solid institution,
    like the one on display in last year’s operating results. In 2019, the Bank approved
    106 sovereign guaranteed loan projects for a total of $11.3 billion. For its part, IDB
    Invest approved about $4.7 billion in operations and sealed commitments for a
    similar amount, exceeding its annual goals.
        Not only did we maintain our triple-A rating, but credit ratings agencies
    all recognized the significant effort we made to ensure our financial strength
    through strict budgetary discipline.
        Our administrative austerity did not prevent us from increasing our activities
    or taking on new development activities. Just as in the past we focused in detail
    on topics such as citizen security, climate change and transparency, in 2019 we
    approved the first operation from our Migration Initiative.
        In addition, we continued our internal drive toward gender equality and raised
    the percentage of women in higher pay grades at both the IDB and IDB Invest.
    We also moved to strengthen our social and environmental safeguards, our
    transparency and integrity frameworks, and our access to information policy.
        These advances both strengthen our reputation as the region’s preferred
    partner and confirm my conviction that we can adapt to meet demands that are
    continuously evolving.
        In a few months, I will conclude what has been the most fascinating and
    gratifying experience of my professional life. I appreciate the trust our countries
    have placed in me to lead the IDB Group over the past 15 years.
        I will continue working until my last day to clear the path for my successors.
    I will do so convinced that for us to meet the great challenges of the coming
    decades, the IDB must be able to continually experiment and reinvent itself.
        More than six decades ago, the founders of this institution made a commitment
    to do exactly that. And today, fulfilling that commitment requires knowing how to
    listen to those voices in Latin America and the Caribbean that rightly demand a
    better present and a future full of opportunities.

    Summary


    Loan Approvals

    In 2019, the Bank approved a total of 106 sovereign guaranteed loan operations with
    total financing of $11.3 billion. The sovereign guaranteed lending program included
    84 investment projects for $5.9 billion, 21 policy-based loan projects for $4.9 billion,
    and a special development lending project for $500 million in Ecuador.

        Investment projects included 17 operations for $1.29 billion under conditional
    credit lines for investment projects (CCLIPs) and one multiphase project for $600
    million to support the equity and effectiveness of the social safety net in Argentina.
        Of the 21 policy-based loan (PBL) projects, the Bank approved three multiple
    tranche PBLs for $450 million and 18 programmatic PBLs for $4.46 billion, of which
    10 loans, for $1.85 billion, corresponded to first stages and eight loans, for $2.6 bil-
    lion, corresponded to subsequent stages.
        Approvals of sovereign guaranteed loan projects returned to the level of the
    preceding five-year period. Average annual approvals for 2015–2019 were $10.9
    billion, matching the 2010–2014 average.
        The sovereign guaranteed lending program financed projects with a total cost
    of $12.9 billion. That includes $11.1 billion from the Ordinary Capital, five projects for
    $119 million from the IDB Grant Facility, three projects with $91 million in financing from
    Bank-administered funds, and $1.58 billion from other sources and local contributions.
        The Bank approved three new contingent credit facilities for natural disaster
    emergencies for $340 million and one $160 million replenishment of funds for Ecua-
    dor’s facility. As a result, 10 countries of the region have this natural disaster facility
    with a coverage of $1.9 billion. Additionally, the Bank approved 10 conditional credit
    lines for investment programs (CCLIPs) for $3.9 billion. Of the 10 CCLIPs, two were
    multisector for $480 million.
        New financing for smaller, more vulnerable nations, known as Group C and D
    countries, accounted for 44%  of approvals in 2019, two percentage points more
    than in 2018. As a result, the Bank continued to solidify its standing as the leading
    source of multilateral finance for the region.
        In terms of sectors, 41% of approved financing was channeled through the Institutions
    for Development Sector (IFD), 30% through the Infrastructure and Energy Sector (INE),
    15% through the Social Sector (SCL), 11% through the Climate Change and Sustainable
    Development Sector (CSD), and 3% through the Integration and Trade Sector (INT).

2   Highlights by Sector


    Institutions for Development Sector (IFD)

    In 2019, IFD continued supporting the efforts of the countries of the region, focusing
    on leveraging technological innovation and consolidating institutional capacity and
    the rule of law.
        In competitiveness, technology, and innovation, IFD continued to foster private
    sector innovation and development by supporting the design and implementation
    of innovation policies and strengthening the associated institutional frameworks. In
    terms of investment, financing was approved for the first CCLIP in the Caribbean,
    which aims to support the Jamaican entrepreneurship ecosystem.
        This program fosters business innovation, technology deployment and develop-
    ment, competitiveness promotion, and strengthening of advanced human capital.
    In terms of technical cooperation, support was provided through regional and local
    proposals in areas ranging from innovation and creative cultural ecosystems in
    Ecuador, Honduras, and Argentina to promotion of green technology use in Brazil,
    stimulation of private sector investment, and promotion of best practices in innova-
    tive public procurement.
        In connectivity, markets, and finance, the IDB continued to design financial
    solutions and risk mitigation structures to mobilize greater private sector investment,
    promote the financing of digital connectivity infrastructure, and improve natural
    disaster risk management and climate change adaptation. Through a combination
    of investment loans, policy-based loans (PBLs), contingent loans, and technical
    assistance, IFD focused on improving productivity in the region’s countries. IFD
    also expanded support to governments for formulating inclusive public policies that
    increase the impact of the fintech industry.
        In fiscal management, IFD continued to strengthen the region’s public finances
    through interventions in tax policy, revenue administration, and quality of public
    spending. At the national level, the sector promoted policies and reforms aimed at
    improving fiscal sustainability through stronger institutional capacity and regulatory
    frameworks, greater efficiency and transparency in fiscal management, and more
    effective and better-quality public spending and national budgets.
        At the subnational level, efforts focused on contributing to provincial/state
    and municipal growth and fiscal sustainability through the modernization of fiscal
    management and improvements in revenue, expenditure, and public investment
    management.
