FOREWORD

Mami Mizutori
Special Representative
of the Secretary-General
for Disaster Risk Reduction

In 2021, the social and economic impact
of COVID-19 continued to magnify risk
exposure and vulnerability worldwide, with
at-risk populations hit hardest, as the world
entered its second year of the pandemic.
Amidst the changing geo-political landscape
and public health crisis, the United Nations
Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR)
continued to emphasize our message that
#PreventionSavesLives, leading the way
on innovation and planned risk-reduction
strategies to strengthen resilience, enhance
technical cooperation assistance and
increase capacity-building efforts with
partners.
In line with its Strategic Framework 20162021, UNDRR supported Member States
in implementing the Sendai Framework for
Disaster Risk Reduction and investing in
preventative action, to accelerate Sustainable
Development Goal targets.

4 | UNITED NATIONS OFFICE FOR DISASTER RISK REDUCTION

This 2021 Annual Report outlines UNDRR’s
work in reducing disaster risk and
strengthening resilience globally. The report
highlights UNDRR’s impact and progress
throughout the year, its achievements
and activities that supported disaster risk
reduction in 2021. The report is structured
along the three Strategic Objectives and two
Enablers of the UNDRR Work Programme,
and focuses on efforts at global, regional,
national and local levels to implement the
Sendai Framework in coordination with, and
in support of, a wide variety of stakeholders.
Our risk landscape is increasingly volatile,
compounded by risk drivers such as climate
change, conflict, displacement, ecosystem
degradation, biodiversity loss and the ongoing
pandemic, which continues to exacerbate
systemic and deeply entrenched economic
and social inequalities. It is at the intersection
of understanding risk and reducing disaster
impact where UNDRR best illustrates its
added value.

Throughout the year, UNDRR strived to
innovate its operations by strengthening
monitoring frameworks, ramping up virtual work
arrangements, and incentivizing stakeholders to
invest in and evolve comprehensive, equitable,
localized, and meaningful plans of action. These
plans can lead to sustainable outcomes for
millions, particularly the hardest to reach, hardest
hit, and most vulnerable to disasters, to ensure no
one is left behind.
Now it is time to look ahead. In April, the
Deputy Secretary-General will launch the 2022
Global Assessment Report (GAR) on Disaster
Risk Reduction, entitled Our World at Risk:
Transforming Governance for a Resilient Future.
The central theme of the GAR 2022 is how
governance systems can evolve to better address
the systemic risks of the future. In May, we will
gather with Member State representatives and
other stakeholders at the Global Platform for
Disaster Risk Reduction in Bali, Indonesia, as well
as at the Asia-Pacific Ministerial Conference for
DRR, in Australia in September.

Throughout 2022, consultations and review
by States and other stakeholders will continue
to inform the Midterm Review of the Sendai
Framework. In the autumn, we will arrive at COP
27, with our clarion call for urgent action on risk
reduction, to reduce climate-related disasters
in a dangerously warmer world.
Each new year brings new challenges, but also
possibilities. Let us reflect on our achievements
in 2021, and continue to work together for a more
resilient, more sustainable and more equitable
world in 2022 and beyond.

Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk
Reduction 2015–2030

Priorities for action

Guiding principles

There is a need for focused action within and across
sectors by States at local, national, regional and
global levels in the following four priority areas.

•	

Primary responsibility of States to prevent
and reduce disaster risk, including through
cooperation.

•	

Shared responsibility between central Government
and national authorities, sectors and stakeholders
as appropriate to national circumstances.

•	

Protection of persons and their assets while
promoting and protecting all human rights
including the right to development.

•	

Engagement from all of society.

•	

Full engagement of all State institutions of an
executive and legislative nature at national and
local levels.

•	

Empowerment of local authorities and
communities through resources, incentives and
decision-making responsibilities as appropriate.

•	

Decision-making to be inclusive and risk-informed
while using a multi-hazard approach.

•	

Coherence of disaster risk reduction and
sustainable development policies, plans, practices
and mechanisms, across different sectors.

•	

Accounting of local and specific characteristics
of disaster risks when determining measures to
reduce risk.

PRIORITY 4

•	

Addressing underlying risk factors costeffectively through investment versus relying
primarly on post-disaster response and recovery.

Experience indicates that disaster preparedness
needs to be strengthened for more effective response
and ensure capacities are in place for effective
recovery. Disasters have also demonstrated that the
recovery, rehabilitation and reconstruction phase,
which needs to be prepared ahead of the disaster,
is an opportunity to «Build Back Better» through
integrating disaster risk reduction measures. Women
and persons with disabilities should publicly lead and
promote gender- equitable and universally accessible
approaches during the response and reconstruction
phases.

•	

«Build Back Better» for preventing the creation of,
and reducing existing, disaster risk.

•	

The quality of global partnership and international
cooperation to be effective, meaningful and
strong.

•	

Support from developed countries and partners to
developing countries to be tailored according to
needs and priorities as identified by them.

PRIORITY 1

Understanding disaster risk
Disaster risk management needs to be based on an
understanding of disaster risk in all its dimensions
of vulnerability, capacity, exposure of persons and
assets, hazard characteristics and the environment.

PRIORITY 2

Expected outcome

Targets

The substantial reduction of disaster risk and losses
in lives, livelihoods and health and in the economic,
physical, social, cultural and environmental assets of
persons, businesses, communities and countries.

a.	 Substantially reduce global disaster mortality by
2030, aiming to lower the average per 100,000
global mortality rate in the decade 2020–2030
compared to the period 2005–2015.

Goal
Prevent new and reduce existing disaster risk
through the implementation of integrated and
inclusive economic, structural, legal, social, health,
cultural, educational, environmental, technological,
political and institutional measures that prevent and
reduce hazard exposure and vulnerability to disaster,
increase preparedness for response and recovery,
and thus strengthen resilience.

b.	 Substantially reduce the number of affected
people globally by 2030, aiming to lower the
average global figure per 100,000 n the decade
2020–2030 compared to the period 2005–2015.
c.	 Reduce direct disaster economic loss in relation
to global gross domestic product (GDP) by 2030.
d.	 Substantially reduce disaster damage to critical
infrastructure and disruption of basic services,
among them health and educational facilities,
including through developing their resilience by
2030.
e.	 Substantially increase the number of countries
with national and local disaster risk reduction
strategies by 2020.

Scope and purpose
The present Framework will apply to the risk of
small-scale and large-scale, frequent and infrequent,
sudden and slow-onset disasters, caused by
natural or man-made hazards, as well as related
environmental, technological and biological
hazards and risks. It aims to guide the multi-hazard
management of disaster risk in development at all
levels as well as within and across all sectors.

8 | UNITED NATIONS OFFICE FOR DISASTER RISK REDUCTION

f.	

Substantially enhance international cooperation
to developing countries through adequate and
sustainable support to complement their national
actions for implementation of the present
Framework by 2030.

g.	 Substantially increase the availability of and
access to multi-hazard early warning systems
and disaster risk information and assessments to
people by 2030.

Strengthening disaster risk governance to manage
disaster risk
Disaster risk governance at the national, regional
and global levels is vital to the management of
disaster risk reduction in all sectors and ensuring the
coherence of national and local frameworks of laws,
regulations and public policies that, by defining roles
and responsibilities, guide, encourage and incentivize
the public and private sectors to take action and
address disaster risk.

PRIORITY 3

Investing in disaster risk reduction for resilience
Public and private investment in disaster risk
prevention and reduction through structural and
non-structural measures are essential to enhance
the economic, social, health and cultural resilience
of persons, communities, countries and their assets,
as well as the environment. These can be drivers of
innovation, growth and job creation. Such measures
are cost-effective and instrumental to save lives,
prevent and reduce losses and ensure effective
recovery and rehabilitation.

“Progress on disaster risk reduction must be urgently prioritized as a
precondition for sustainable development. Being ready saves lives – and
money. Sound disaster risk management and increased resilience can
safeguard hard-won gains in health, education, water, sanitation and more. It
can also prevent new risk by ensuring that social and economic development
are risk-informed.”
António Guterres
United Nations Secretary-General

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
While 2020 brought the world a global pandemic,
2021 ushered in a new normal, largely dominated
by risk. Throughout the year, the COVID-19 global
pandemic continued to be felt in all corners of
the globe, creating and exacerbating a range
of challenges, not only related to health, but
also those with economic, social and political
consequences. Within that context, UNDRR’s
work largely focused on the systemic and
interconnected nature of risk, and how it can
trigger cascading impacts that unevenly harm
society’s most marginalized.

On the International Day for Disaster Risk
Reduction on 13 October, the Centre of
Excellence on Disaster and Climate Resilience
was launched. A joint UNDRR and WMO initiative,
the Centre is designed to ensure synergy between
DRR and climate action. It will convene climate
and disaster risk reduction thought leaders
and practitioners for joint research, capacity
development and advocacy. Twelve United
Nations and non-United-Nations organizations
joined the Centre and participated in the first
steering committee meeting.

During conferences, panels and meetings, UNDRR
spoke to the idea that systemic, interconnected
challenges require systemic, interconnected solutions. Because the enormous gap for financing disaster risk reduction persists, UNDRR colleagues
repeated a familiar message: resilience is not an
extra cost but a wise investment. Fortunately,
this message is increasingly hitting home, with
COVID-19 and climate change raising awareness
about risk more now than ever. Particularly, at the
COP26 held in November, resilience featured high
on the political and business agendas.

In late 2021, four Regional Platforms for Disaster
Risk Reduction were held in different parts of the
world: Jamaica (Americas and the Caribbean),
Kenya (Africa), Morocco (Arab States) and
Portugal (Europe and Central Asia). The outcome
documents from these platforms, as well as from
the Asia-Pacific Partnership Forum on Disaster
Risk Reduction, which took place in December,
provide guidance on integrated risk management.
The goal is to foster coherence across
different agendas: sustainable development,
climate action, humanitarian response and
the preservation of biodiversity and ecological
systems.

The year began with UNDRR adopting a new
Strategic Framework for 2022-2025 and Work
Programme for 2022-2023, which focused on
accelerating implementation of the Sendai
Framework, while continuing to embody the
message that disasters do not have to devastate.
Not long after, the Global Risk Assessment
Framework was rolled out to support Member
States in better understanding risk and making
risk-informed decisions by offering an improved
data eco-system. In close collaboration with
UN Country Teams and Humanitarian Country
Teams, the rollout included pilots in Bangladesh,
Costa-Rica, Eswatini, Fiji, Pakistan, Somalia and
Sudan. Participating countries received guidance
on improving risk-data use and systemic risk
analysis.
12 | UNITED NATIONS OFFICE FOR DISASTER RISK REDUCTION

Six years after the Sendai Framework was
adopted, its Midterm Review kicked off with
the adoption of General Assembly resolution A/
RES/76/204 on Disaster Risk Reduction. Member
States determined that the Midterm Review will
conclude with a high-level meeting of the General
Assembly, to be held in May 2023. The Midterm
Review offers an opportunity to renew political
commitment and identify risk-reduction priorities
for the remaining implementation period of the
Sendai Framework 2015-2030. 

STRENGTHEN GLOBAL MONITORING,
ANALYSIS AND COORDINATION OF SENDAI
FRAMEWORK IMPLEMENTATION
UNDRR promotes risk awareness, as well as methods for
reducing and managing risks, to ensure that development
and humanitarian interventions are risk-informed and
sustainable. The Sendai Framework is the global blueprint
for reducing disaster risk and offers a practical roadmap
for governments and stakeholders to assess risk and
develop integrated solutions that reach those most at risk.
In 2021, UNDRR supported Member States’ progress,
reporting against the Sendai Framework, as well as DRRrelated targets of the SDGs, through the Sendai Framework
Monitor (SFM). By year end, 155 out of 195 countries were
using the SFM online system, which strengthens data
availability and standards, as well as official statistical
information on disasters and disaster risk reduction. This
vital information helps evaluate the potential success of
preventative and post-disaster action.
Improved availability and geographical coverage of data
made it possible for UNDRR to accurately monitor DRR
progress around the world and contribute to increasing the
amount and quality of evidence-driven information shared
by Member States. UNDRR also led efforts to advance
official disaster-related statistics as a core aspect of the
SFM, by taking a central role in the development of a global
framework on disaster-related statistics. These efforts,
intended to enhance data quality and standards in disaster
data, were undertaken in partnership with the United
Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UN
DESA) and UN Regional Commissions.
With water-related hazards becoming a key concern
around the world, UNDRR launched the GAR Special Report
on Drought 2021, in collaboration with the UN Convention
to Combat Desertification (UNCCD). The report explored
the systemic nature of drought and how it affects health
and well-being, as well as stymies achievement of the
Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction and the
Sustainable Development Goals. Drawing on case studies,
the report and Summary for Policy Makers provided crucial
policy guidance for stakeholders and uses data trends and
patterns to propose impactful and targeted policy options
for improving drought management.
Other key policy guidance and knowledge products
were developed at regional level. In 2021, two regional
assessment reports were launched for the first time,
offering a regional perspective of the risk landscape: the
Regional Assessment Report on Disaster Risk in Latin
America and the Caribbean, and the Regional Assessment
Report on Disaster Risk Reduction in the Arab States.

SUPPORT TO REGIONAL AND NATIONAL
SENDAI FRAMEWORK IMPLEMENTATION
Cities have been on the frontline of the COVID-19
emergency and feature highly in UNDRR’s priorities.
Making Cities Resilient 2030 (MCR2030), which was
developed and implemented through an alliance of UNDRR
and key partners, gathered momentum in 2021, thanks to
the strong commitment of local governments and service
providers. 641 local government officials and 164 service
providers, covering a population of over 420 million people,
joined MCR2030 to give and receive technical support,
resources, and services related to implementation of the
Sendai Framework. MCR2030 has been embraced as a tool
for building resilience, making cities safer, preventing risks
and promoting innovation and investments.
The programme has twelve core partners, who help urban
stakeholders raise awareness about the importance
of understanding risk, receive training on disaster and
hazard resilience, and improve risk analysis and data
management. The initiative also helped to foster stronger
links across disaster-risk governance, climate change,
humanitarian, development, and socioeconomic sectors,
at municipal level. At regional level, city-to-city exchanges
promote the uptake of DRR strategies and plans, and
strengthen connections that support urban resilience.
UNDRR capacity development programmes continued to
be a vital source of innovation for regional, national and
local stakeholders, including UN country teams (UNCTs).
The programmes offer technical support on national and
local disaster risk reduction approaches, risk-informed
plans, and resilience-building capacities.
Working with partners across the United Nations, UNDRR
successfully developed and customized online training
modules. These modules focus on disaster-risk outreach,
early-warning systems and responses, and solutions
at the crossroads of DRR, socioeconomic recovery,
inclusion, health and climate change. UNDRR provided
stakeholders with access to state-of-the-art tools and
enhanced its online and hybrid delivery of products and
services. This led to an increase in training, webinar and
event participants compared with previous years. The
UNDRR Global Education and Training Institute (GETI), for
example, reached 21,920 stakeholders through 53 training
programmes, 27 events and 16 webinars, with 46 per cent
of participants identifying as women in 2021.

To catalyse action, UNDRR strengthened engagement
with different segments of society through an all-ofsociety approach, including Member States, the private
sector, parliamentarians, science and technology, women,
youth, people with disabilities and across community-led
organizations.
UNDRR coordinated and chaired the UN Senior Leadership
Group on DRR for Resilience (UN SLG), as well as the
UN Disaster Risk Reduction Focal Points Group, which
is comprised of 43 United Nations entities. UNDRR also
supported Member States in ensuring coherence with
implementation of internationally agreed agendas, releasing
some 13 intergovernmental outcome documents that
integrated DRR and provided intergovernmental guidance
for risk-informed policy-setting and action at national level.
To scale up DRR in humanitarian action, UNDRR provided
critical data to strengthen interagency engagement,
addressed gaps in humanitarian actors’ DRR capacity
and developed a training package on Scaling up DRR in
Humanitarian Action.

UNDRR continued to strengthen relationships with the
private sector through its flagship vehicle for private sector
collaboration, ARISE, which grew to over 400 registered
members from 29 national and regional networks.
Multi-stakeholder engagement increased. The UNDRR
Stakeholder Engagement Mechanism (SEM) boasted 390
members and consolidated its role as a key mechanism in
the High-level Political Forum, the United Nations central
platform for follow-up and review of the 2030 Agenda for
Sustainable Development, promoting evidence-based
discussions and reflections on DRR and sustainable
development.
The Sendai Framework Voluntary Commitments
online platform, operated by UNDRR, continued to
catalyse stakeholders to showcase their work, monitor
commitments, and track progress on deliverables. It is a
key tool for promoting accountability among non-state
actors, as well as the main reference point for sharing
information about stakeholders’ efforts to implement the
Sendai Framework.

ENHANCING KNOWLEDGE, MANAGEMENT,
COMMUNICATION AND GLOBAL ADVOCACY

Parliamentarian engagement also strengthened throughout
the year, with the launch of a toolkit for parliamentarians by
UNDRR and the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) as a basis
for further accelerated action on DRR to achieve the SDGs.
Similarly, UNDRR engaged as a key partner for the Climate
Vulnerable Forum (CVF), including in the launch of a new
CVF Parliamentarian group on Sendai Framework and Paris
Agreement.

UNDRR’s global advocacy and engagement across
all platforms continued to rise in 2021. The Special
Representative of the UN Secretary-General (SRSG)
Mami Mizutori, took part in many in-person and virtual
appearances, delivering poignant messages. The content
she shared at key international events, meetings, and
panels was redistributed across multiple digital media.

UNDRR worked closely with partners to support genderresponsive disaster risk reduction. There was significant
progress implementing the nine United Nations
recommendations of the Gender Equality and Women’s
Empowerment and Leadership in Disaster Risk Reduction
(GEWEL-DRR) report.

UNDRR garnered extensive media coverage for COP26,
demonstrating the relevance of DRR as part of the climate
emergency. Key developments were reported in 72
separate media items, drawing attention to the need to
accelerate disaster risk reduction as a way of managing
growing climate-related risks.

Youth engagement rose in all Regional Platforms for
DRR, leading to more inclusive and impactful disaster risk
reduction initiatives globally. UNDRR organized the first
ever Youth Forum For Disaster Risk Reduction prior to
the Regional Platform in the Americas and the Caribbean.
300 young changemakers participated in the event from
the region, resulting in a Youth Declaration on DRR. Youth
were also central to the design and implementation of
the Stakeholder Engagement Mechanism, taking the lead
in engaging stakeholders at the 2021 High-level Political
Forum (HLPF) and Financing for Development Forum, as
well as providing inputs for the Food Systems Summit and
COP26.

Meanwhile, UNDRR increased advocacy and
communication efforts, raising awareness of disaster
risk themes including drought, food security, tsunamis,
earthquakes, flooding, biological hazards, nature-based
solutions and links with social, economic and health
spheres. UNDRR leveraged events and major campaigns
to engage partners and stakeholders in disaster risk
reduction initiatives.

The Words Into Action (WiA) series, jointly developed
by UNDRR and communities of experts, focused on
nature-based solutions and traditional knowledge in
DRR. Multimedia packages were created for existing
WiA publications, making the information more easily
accessible and usable.

STRENGTHENED ORGANIZATIONAL
PERFORMANCE
Efforts to mobilize financial resources for UNDRR resulted
in USD 44 million received from donors. Donors’ generous
voluntary contributions recognized UNDRR’s vital role
in strengthening the DRR agenda during the COVID-19
response and recovery, as well as the organization’s
ability to adapt and innovate to ensure delivery of its work
programme.
In the second year of COVID-19’s continued uncertainty,
UNDRR remained resilient and productive, adapting to new
working realities. Across the organization, the use of virtual
events allowed UNDRR to connect with more partners
around the globe. The 2020 mandatory, organization-wide
training dedicated to project management provided a solid
foundation for introducing the new tools.
UNDRR adopted a comprehensive entity risk register and
risk treatment plan aligned with the Secretariat Enterprise
Risk Management. Improvements to central monitoring
tools such as the management and KPI dashboards
assisted in the oversight of operational benchmarks and
effectiveness.
UNDRR continued to perform well against gender-parity
performance indicators. By the end of 2021, 58 per cent of
staff were female.

International Day for Disaster Risk Reduction and World
Tsunami Awareness Day focused on Sendai Framework
target F, to substantially enhance international cooperation on DRR. #OnlyTogether proved to be UNDRR’s
most successful outreach campaign to date, generating
500 million social media impressions across the two days.

MAINSTREAMING GENDER EQUALITY AND DISABILITY INCLUSION

“I hope this recognition will encourage other young women to follow their
dreams of becoming scientists or engineers. We need gender balance in these
professions and the whole of society will benefit.”

Dr. Rahma Hanifa
Winner of the WIN DRR Rising Star Award

MAINSTREAMING GENDER EQUALITY
AND DISABILITY INCLUSION
In 2021, UNDRR mainstreamed gender equality
across all objectives of the UNDRR Strategic
Framework for 2022-2025, and incorporated
gender and disability into organizational
policies, guidelines, messaging, and
mechanisms. This included making
improvements to reporting standards
and practices on disaggregating sex, age,
and disability data, leveraging women’s
leadership in DRR, and increasing genderresponsive COVID-19 and health-centred
recovery.

The UNDRR flagship women’s leadership
programme, the Women’s International
Network for Disaster Risk Reduction (WIN
DRR), grew rapidly in 2021, through the
establishment of national networks in AsiaPacific, and a new Latin America and the
Caribbean Women’s Network for DRR.
One of the priorities of WIN DRR is to
recognize the achievements of women
working in disaster risk reduction. The
inaugural WIN DRR Leadership Awards
were presented at a high-level event on
International Day for Disaster Risk Reduction
to highlight the work of women who are
changing the field of disaster risk reduction.
The Excellence Award, proudly sponsored
by SM Prime, was granted to Vasiti Soko,
the Director of the National Disaster
Management Office in Fiji, while the Rising
Star Award went to Dr. Nuraini Rahma Hanifa,
an earthquake scientist who founded the
U-INSPIRE Alliance to bring together young
professionals working to reduce disaster risk
in their communities.
These professional networks for women
working in disaster risk reduction promote
and support women’s leadership by building
the evidence base for women’s leadership,

recognizing women’s achievements and
supporting DRR institutions in removing barriers
faced by women in furthering their career.

“When a disaster strikes,
the whole community can
benefit and access support
and services only when
disaster risk reduction and
preparedness are accessible
and inclusive. We can
best achieve this when

and their representative
organizations join us in
disaster risk reduction
efforts from the start.
Finland works with UNDRR
to strengthen awareness of
and participation in disability
inclusive disaster risk
reduction.”

“Effective disaster risk
reduction is inclusive,
taking into consideration
the capacities and needs
of women, persons with
disabilities and other
vulnerable groups. Australia
recognizes these people are
leaders, first responders,
and agents of change.
These groups have unique
knowledge and experience
essential to the survival
and to the resilience of
their communities. To build
sustainable resilience for
all and leave no one behind,
we must harness these
capabilities, and ensure all
voices are heard. Australia is
proud to support the Women’s
International Network for
Disaster Risk Reduction,
a professional network of
women in the Asia-Pacific, to
enhance their role in decision
making, empower them to
attain leadership and ensure
their voices are heard.”

A central tenet of many global frameworks leading up to
the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, gender
equality was a key corporate action area for UNDRR in
2021. Focus was given to supporting gender-responsive
COVID-19 recovery, integrating gender across earlywarning early-action value chains, and women’s leadership
in disaster risk reduction, as well as to upholding the rights
of members of the LGBTQIA+ community. UNDRR also
strives to promote gender equality within the organization,
with 58 per cent of UNDRR staff female by the end of 2021.
UNDRR co-led the United Nations Joint Study on
Gender Equality and Women’s Empowerment and
Leadership with UN Women and UNFPA. The study
made nine recommendations for UN entities to advance
gender-responsive DRR. These recommendations were
endorsed by the UN System to support gender-responsive
implementation of the Sendai Framework, including
through a gender-responsive midterm review process.
Disability inclusion was endorsed globally and in the
regions as part of the UNDRR Strategic Framework for
2022-2025, with UNDRR calling attention to, and increasing
engagement with, the establishment of accessible
disability-friendly DRR projects and communications, that
uphold the rights of persons with disabilities.
In the preparation of the regional platforms for DRR,
disability groups from the respective regions, and youth
representatives, were involved in concept design, session
content, facilitating side events on disability-centred DRR,
and disseminating takeaway messages.
Inclusivity and intersectionality were foundational themes
of the European Forum for Disaster Risk Reduction
(EFDRR) conference in Europe and Central Asia where the
roadmap for 2021-2030 was developed. Keynote speakers
at EFDRR side events focused on youth engagement,
disability, and gender-responsive DRR, LGBTQIA+ inclusion,
disaster displacement, and collaboration with the private
sector drew the biggest audiences and interest.

TRANSITIONING BEYOND COVID-19

“We face challenging times: Compounding risks of an increasing climate
crisis and COVID-19 hit the most vulnerable the hardest. We need to act
urgently and collectively: Understand and anticipate risk, reduce it where
possible - also by enabling anticipatory action, respond where necessary and
build back better. We are grateful for UNDRR’s strong efforts and guidance for
the implementation of the Sendai Framework.”

Ms. Luise Amtsberg
Federal Government Commissioner for Human Rights Policy and Humanitarian
Assistance at the German Federal Foreign Office, Germany

TRANSITIONING BEYOND COVID-19
In 2021, COVID-19, a systemic risk and global
crisis, continued to affect millions of people
around the world, causing record losses in lives
and destruction of livelihoods. In response,

Implementation amid
and beyond COVID-19
pandemic supports
at-risk groups
The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the
importance of supporting children and youth
with disaster-safety education. In 2021, UNDRR
expanded the delivery of the Korean School Safety
Programme to students with disabilities and those
situated in remote and rural areas of the Republic
of Korea. The programme, jointly delivered by the
UNDRR Office of Northeast Asia, the Government
of the Republic of Korea and the Citizens’ Coalition
for Safety, was adapted for online learning amid
COVID-19. Its successful use shows that with
appropriate adaptation to the environment, students
and teachers can still achieve intended learning
outcomes of the programme and continue to
support online learning for remote populations
beyond the pandemic. In 2021, training was
conducted both in-person and online to help more
students and schools become disaster prepared and
disaster-risk aware.

Engagement Strategy to align new and existing
global DRR and early-warning frameworks,
policies, and technical guidelines with national
and regional health initiatives. This strategy
helped stakeholders increase evidence and
learning foundations to improve the consolidation
of novel, or once fringe, issues like biological
hazards into mainstream risk-reduction
thinking. The strategy also proved to be a timely
instrument for leveraging partnerships and
disseminating relevant guidance and information.
UNDRR made collaborative, data-centric,
technical, and behavioural strides to shift
perspectives on understanding the nature of risk,
the interplay of climate change and other natural
and human-made hazards, and the importance
of embedding ambitious DRR targets and
approaches into national health, economic, and
social plans and projects.
Moreover, UNDRR worked with the regions and
its partners to make DRR spaces more inclusive
and resilient for communities and cities to better
adjust in the face of multiplying shocks. UNDRR
global and regional training on how to align
DRR approaches and mechanisms with healthfocused systems and services, resulted in 40 per
cent of participants channelling their new-found
DRR knowledge into local COVID-19 response and
recovery plans, and another 58 per cent leading or
contributing to local government consultations.
As COVID-19 shows signs of waning in
many parts of the world, governments, DRR
stakeholders and activists are now faced with
the hybrid task of providing immediate, effective
disaster-risk and emergency stopgaps while
also thinking beyond the pandemic to address
emerging realities and the future shocks we, as
global citizens, will undoubtedly face.

SCALING UP DRR IN HUMANITARIAN ACTION
UNDRR’s humanitarian-development action was
strengthened through improved disaster-data
quality standards and enshrined in both the online
Sendai Framework Monitoring (SFM) system and

“The School Safety
Programme [jointly delivered
by the UNDRR Office
of Northeast Asia, the
Government of the Republic
of Korea and the Citizens’
Coalition for Safety] helped
my students to have a better
understanding of disaster.
Their conceptualization of
disasters has changed from
just enumerating different
types of hazards such as
earthquake, typhoon and
so forth, to identifying risk
factors.”
Ms. Seo Seonju

global frameworks for disaster-related statistics.
Such instruments were integral for measuring,
assessing, and forecasting disaster risk,
damage, and loss in multiple contexts. Through
aligning national frameworks and strategies,
United Nations country teams (UNCTs) could
better leverage partnerships with humanitariandevelopment stakeholders and incite collective
DRR action that enlisted Sendai Framework and
SDG outcomes to build back better and ensure no
one is left behind in the process.
As part of the pilot for testing the Scaling up
DRR in Humanitarian Action Checklist in 2021,
UNDRR and UNOCHA published two countrypiloted snapshots for Haiti and Pakistan.
UNCTs in Bangladesh and South Sudan equally
championed the roll-out of the checklist, and
technical support was provided to them to
strengthen the integration of DRR in humanitarian
planning and programming.
Through partnership with OCHA, disaster
risk reduction became part of humanitarian
policy references including the Humanitarian
Programme Cycle (HPC) 2022 Facilitation
Package and the IASC RC/HC Handbook on
Leadership in Humanitarian Action.
To strengthen coordination on DRR in the
humanitarian agenda, UNDRR officially launched
the initiative Scaling up DRR in Humanitarian
Action in 2021.1 Core partners include IOM,
UNICEF, OCHA and UNDP, and it has more than 15
other humanitarian and DRR partners including
NGOs. The initiative provides practical guidance,
tools, knowledge sharing and technical support to
risk-inform humanitarian action.

STRATEGIC OBJECTIVE 1

1.1

GLOBAL PROGRESS OF THE SENDAI
FRAMEWORK AND RELATED SDG
TARGETS ASSESSED
The Sendai Framework Monitoring (SFM) portal
was designed for Member States to assess
and track global progress in reducing disaster
losses and risks, and contributions made towards
accelerating the Sustainable Development
Goals (SDGs) outcomes related to disaster risk
reduction. By year end, data from 155 countries
was collated and archived through the platform,
representing 80 per cent of UN Member and
Observer States. Of these, 78 countries reported
on all seven global targets of the Sendai
Framework at least once.

Throughout the year, UNDRR continued to support
Member States in regular reporting on the seven
Sendai Framework Global Targets A through G and
related targets and indicators of SDGs 1, 11, and
13. Technical consultations, operational efforts,
knowledge sharing, and capacity building were
central to increasing country engagement with the
SFM and strengthened common data standards
for verifying the success of preventative and postdisaster risk-reduction solutions.

Increasing data accessibility and geographical coverage
helped UNDRR monitor disaster risk reduction progress and
update Sendai Framework reports and policies in a timely
and comprehensive manner. Using available data, UNDRR
spearheaded efforts in providing evidence-driven and
detailed analytical inputs to United Nations formal mechanisms and reports, including the 2021 High-Level Political
Forum, Sustainable Development Goals Report for 2021,
Special Report of the Secretary-General on SDG Implementation, the UN Secretary General’s Report on Sendai
Framework Implementation, in addition to the forthcoming
Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction 2022.
To improve the understanding of the current global disasterdata ecosystem and how SFM strengthens it, UNDRR
organized a Technical Forum on the platform. Over 200
participants from around the world took part in the twoday event to deliberate on technical standards, innovative
practices in data collection, data and metric applications,
and methods for securing data quality. The event
demonstrated the varied current and potential uses and
applications of SFM data and metrics and its contributions
to strengthening data standards.
To further improve disaster-data standards, UNDRR led
global efforts to advance official disaster statistics, as
a core aspect of Sendai Framework Monitoring, through
taking a central role in the ongoing development of
the global framework on disaster-related statistics in
partnership with the statistical division of UN DESA and the
five UN Regional Commissions.

In all regions, the SFM strengthened official data for
disaster-related loss and damage tools, and enhanced
understanding progress in disaster risk reduction for
national stakeholders, United Nations country teams
(UNCTs), and humanitarian-development partners. This, in
turn, guided collective DRR action to accelerate achievement
of Sendai Framework targets and SDG outcomes.
The launch of a regional SFM module further enabled
monitoring of regional progress in disaster risk reduction by
intergovernmental organizations.
In Asia and the Pacific, the regional office worked closely
with UNCTs to synchronize Sendai Framework indicators
across new United Nations Sustainable Development
Cooperation Frameworks (UNSDCFs) and national DRR
plans. In Lao PDR, Bangladesh, the Maldives, Thailand,
the Philippines and Indonesia, new UNSDCFs drew from
Sendai Framework indicators to measure and accelerate
progress. Instrumental to this process was online and
in-person training in Indonesia, Thailand, Lao PDR, Brunei,
Republic of Korea, India and the Philippines, where more
than 1,500 participants from the region took part. Similarly,
the UNDRR Pacific sub-Office collaborated with the Pacific
Community and RedR Australia to facilitate SFM capacities
through workshops and one-on-one sessions for 30
stakeholders from 14 countries, including 12 small-island
developing states (SIDS). As a result, SIDS reporting saw an
impressive 400 per cent increase compared to the previous
year. Overall, online e-learning tools were updated, helping
regional partners improve SFM engagement during the
second year of the COVID-19 pandemic.
In the Arab States, WHO country offices in Jordan, Egypt
and Lebanon coordinated with UNDRR to mobilize all
national ministries of health in providing disaggregated and
accurate data on COVID-19 losses (primarily under targets
A, B and D) for SFM reporting purposes — information
that was translated and disseminated to national Sendai
Framework and WHO Health Ministry focal points in the
region.
In Africa, UNDRR supported Member States in their efforts
to report on the Sendai Framework Monitor through
organizing seven virtual SFM Support Days. The SFM
Support Days provided regular support to SFM focal points
to foster a community of practice for the SFM monitoring
and reporting process in Africa. SFM Support Days allowed
UNDRR to share system updates on new features and
reporting progress, with sessions focused on Targets A, B,
E and F, as well as sectoral coordination and the use of the
new SFM regional module. Approximately 70 participants
from 40 Member States participated in the monthly virtual
meetings, with presentations, summaries and technical
guidance notes shared with all SFM focal points. Direct
individual support was also provided to Member States
upon request, including Mauritius, Madagascar, Liberia,
Benin, Cote d’Ivoire, Mozambique, Guinea and Cabo
Verde. As a direct result, four of these countries joined the
reporting process in 2021.

STRATEGIC OBJECTIVE 1

UNDRR and partners in Europe and Central Asia provided
support to over 50 government stakeholders, monitoring
disaster-risk outcomes in Albania, Denmark, Finland,
Hungary, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, Romania,
Slovenia, the United Kingdom and, through the Central Asia
Initiative, experts and policy makers in Central Asia, on the
use of the Sendai Framework Monitoring system. Targeted
technical support was also provided to DRR focal points in
France, Germany, Switzerland and the United Kingdom on
improving reporting standards on COVID-19 impacts. Regional engagement with the European Commission helped
UNDRR amplify coordination of the monitoring of the Sendai
Framework and the Union Disaster Resilience Goals (DRGs)
— particularly targets E and G. Work focused on the two
initial priorities set by the European Commission in rolling
out its work on the Disaster Resilience Goals (disaster-risk management plans and early-warning systems / risk
information), and the potential development of customized
regional indicators within the Sendai Framework Monitor.
Twenty-eight countries (representing over 77 per cent)
in the Americas and the Caribbean uploaded disasterrisk data through the SFM, providing useful information
for working groups focused on DRR and disaster-related
statistics. The technical secretariat of UNDRR and the
Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean
(ECLAC) used this data to publish the Institutional and
Methodological Recommendations for Measuring Disasterrelated SDG Indicators and Sendai Framework Indicators
in Spanish. This document is slated for approval by the
Statistics Conference of the Americas in early 2022, before
being translated into English.
Building trust through official data: Information accessed
through the SFM portal is applied in the creation and
implementation of localized policies and initiatives, and in
raising support for strengthening disaster-risk statistics and
modalities. Having established the SFM in 2018, UNDRR
supports countries in reporting to it based on a longstanding disaster-loss accounting system, DesInventar, that
facilitates reporting on four of the seven Sendai Framework
global targets related to disaster losses.

Official disaster statistics generated through the Sendai
Framework Monitor, and related SDG indicators, provide
reliable means to assess progress in reducing disaster risk
and adapting to climate change, and to inform and monitor
disaster-risk management and anticipatory action.
The UNDRR Office in Bonn, responsible for facilitating
SFM capacity development for governments and
interested organizations, incorporated recommendations
that improved how data was featured, accessed, and
evaluated. Looking ahead, UNDRR will continue to scale-up
methodologies for the global framework that will improve
the robustness of data in the system. In addition, a new
disaster-loss accounting system is in development that will
contribute to the SFM process, particularly targets A to D,
while enhancing the understanding of risk.
Furthermore, related to Target G of the Sendai Framework
-- focused on increasing the availability of and access
to multi‑hazard early-warning systems and disaster-risk
information and assessments to the people by 2030 –
UNDRR is partnering with WMO, through a joint initiative
supported by the Climate Risk and Early Warning Systems
(CREWS), to develop a set of custom indicators for
countries to better measure the effectiveness of their multihazard early-warning systems.
Developed in consultation with an expert working group,
the custom indicators complementing the global indicators
under Target G, will be integrated into the Sendai Framework
Monitor, and available in all six United Nations languages
in 2022, for countries to choose based on their contexts.
The feature is expected to especially benefit the LDCs and
SIDS in the Caribbean, Pacific and Africa that are particularly
vulnerable to natural and biological hazards.
Reducing gaps on the ground and implementing
preventative measures requires collective action along with
statistical rigour and strengthened common data standards.
Behind the SFM indicators are lived experiences and new
opportunities that feed into the design of strategic action for
preventing or reducing future disaster losses.

To meet Sendai Framework conventions, the online tool
simplifies data collection and aggregation for governments,
international organizations, disaster risk reduction outfits,
CSOs, and other stakeholders, when reporting on the seven
global targets,2 and 38 indicators agreed by Member States.
Thanks to an improved classification system of hazards and
disaster-related statistics, SFM data is distilled and made
accessible in real-time, enabling users to evaluate data by
region, country, year, target (A through G), and indicator. It
thus helps stakeholders improve national data standards,
develop policy and monitor targets, secure DRR financing,
and establish localized monitoring and evaluation systems
effectively.

GLOBAL RISK DATA, ANALYSIS, AND POLICY
ADVICE GENERATED
At global level, UNDRR refined the
Global Risk Assessment Framework
(GRAF) internal methods and operational
capacities in Bangladesh, Costa Rica,
Eswatini, Fiji, Pakistan, Somalia and
Sudan. UNDRR improved endorsement
of, access to, and use of, risk data
for national government employees,
engaging 400 local stakeholders in
ways of analysing interconnected and
systemic risks that directly support local
DRR policy decisions. GRAF-supported
action led to improvements in modelling
DRR and preparedness solutions, a better
understanding of local vulnerabilities, and
the creation of robust simulations that
capture cascading impacts according
to a chain of potential events. UNDRR
also supported Costa Rica, South Sudan,
Eswatini and Somalia in assessing
systemic risk by modelling connected
socio-economic impacts of risk
landscapes and bringing them in line with
national budget and planning priorities.
Assessments led to improvements in the
systemic risk knowledge and capacities of
national ministries (finance, infrastructure,
labour, agriculture, transportation, energy,
and national planning), disaster-risk
management agencies, national research
organizations, think tanks, and local nongovernmental organizations.
Throughout the year, UNDRR strengthened
efforts to become more active in generating
core policy guidance on key DRR topics.
The Policy brief: Financing Prevention
and De-risking Investment explored the
challenges faced in financing disaster
prevention in relation to the climate
emergency, highlighting that prudent risk
management requires preparation for a
range of negative outcomes associated
with varying degrees of warming. The brief

“Through support from
UNDRR’s Global Risk
Assessment Framework
(GRAF), national institutions
are sharing high-quality risk
information to strengthen
risk knowledge. As shocks
are becoming more complex,
our cooperation with UNDRR
is focusing on assessing
systemic risks, including
from climate change, to guide
financial decision-making
and public investment,
with particular focus on
the protection of public
infrastructure to avoid loss
and damage and encourage
early recovery in case of
disaster events.”

STRATEGIC OBJECTIVE 1

provided policy recommendations including establishing
a pipeline for disaster and climate-resilient infrastructure
investment and COVID-19 stimulus packages that build
resilience.
In addition, UNDRR’s Strategic Framework for 2022-2025
integrates the DRR agenda with the climate agenda
and employs climate-risk reduction as a fundamental
accelerator for organizational performance in supporting
the achievement of the Sendai Framework. In support of
this key accelerator, the UNDRR Policy Brief: Disaster Risk
Reduction and Climate Change called for scaled-up actions
in key areas to better address the climate emergency and
provide decision-makers with concrete recommendations
for risk-informed climate action. Moreover, the
establishment of an internal climate-change accelerator
group and climate-change strategy both fed into the UNDRR
roadmap for scaling-up climate action at the COP26 and
beyond.
In Asia and the Pacific, UNDRR used GRAF to support
the development of a new United Nations Sustainable
Development Cooperation Framework (UNSDCF) for the
Pacific that includes a systemic risk approach built on a
foundation of data and recommendations for improving
cross-sectoral risk governance in 14 Common Country
Analyses (CCAs).
In Europe and Central Asia, UNDRR in collaboration with
the Centre for Emergency Situations and Disaster Risk
Reduction (CESDRR) and the Disaster Preparedness and
Prevention Initiative for South-eastern Europe (DPPI SEE)
updated the sub-national INFORM risk index that was first
developed by OCHA and European Commission’s Joint

Research Centre for the Regional Inter-Agency Standing
Committee (IASC) Task Force for Caucasus and Central
Asia. With an interactive visual dashboard, the INFORM Risk
Index for Central Asia and the South Caucuses and Southeast Europe shows how risks differ across sub-national
units in a country and draws from 60 indicators to correlate
exposure to hazards, socio-economic vulnerability, and
coping capacities in Albania, North Macedonia, Montenegro,
Azerbaijan, Armenia, Georgia, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan,
Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan and Tajikistan.

UNDRR collaboration with Science, Technology,
Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) institutions, and
intergovernmental organizations, led to a widely publicized
launch that characterized the need for more multi-sector
approaches that cover risks in the region. Similarly, a
regional Working Group on the Measurement and Recording
of Indicators Related to Disaster Risk Reduction in Latin
America and the Caribbean 2020-2021 was created to
support the analysis of national Sendai Framework
implementation.

Moreover, with support from UNDRR, the European Science
and Technology Advisory Group (E-STAG) co-produced an
important and timely policy paper on research needed to
address climate-adaptation gaps. This paper contributed
to exploring options for implementing adaptation actions
toward multi-hazard risk reduction and cascading risks
and the compound nature of disasters locally and across
national frontiers.

In the Arab States, UNDRR launched the first Regional
Assessment Report on DRR during a special session at the
Fifth Arab Regional Platform for disaster risk reduction
in November 2021. The report represented a major step
towards the adoption of a modern, regional view of
disaster-risk countermeasures, as well as an analysis
of region-specific systemic drivers. The report also
covered contextualized case studies on vulnerability, rapid
urbanization, conflict, and food security, and a review of
seven emerging systemic risks in the region.3

The publication of the Regional Assessment Report (RAR
2021) in the Americas and the Caribbean addressed critical
gaps in risk knowledge and contributed substantially to
fostering collaboration among key stakeholders from
science and academic and decision makers. Launched in
2021, the first-ever RAR report detailed evidence-based
insights into emerging trends and new drivers of risk in the
region, including an account of the progress made towards
meeting the targets of the Sendai Framework and analysis
of the root causes and manifestations of risk that are
leading to increasingly devastating disasters in both human
and material terms.

In full bloom: DRR engagement in East Africa
Emergencies and disasters have exposed gaps in
East African countries and exacerbated negative
societal and economic trends, including the rise of
gender-based violence (GBV), teenage pregnancy, and
food insecurity. In Kenya, women and girls are often
responsible for balancing environmental, livelihood, and
social responsibilities — whether they farm or collect
water and firewood, the environmental ramifications
of the hazards (e.g., drought, pollution) encountered,
expose them to risks that affect entire communities,
family-planning choices, health indicators, levels of
insecurity and access to education and services. Many

26 | UNITED NATIONS OFFICE FOR DISASTER RISK REDUCTION

governments in Africa have prioritized saving lives and
preventing losses through the maintenance of multihazard early-warning systems that are sector-focused
and based in established ministries. In Kenya, local
administrators responsible for emergency and disastermanagement action, a role they share with national
and county governments, understand the importance
of strengthening preparedness plans to facilitate the
response to disasters. This requires greater support
to enhance human capacities and financial resources
needed to design medium-term to long-term prevention
measures.

The UNDRR regional office in Africa ramped up action
in Ethiopia, by rolling-out a capacity-building initiative
on early-warning forest-fire information management
and risk-sensitive budget reviews. In collaboration with
national authorities from DRR, forests, and meteorology, the
forest-fire information-management system relies on the
MyDEWETRA platform, an open-source web-based system
for real-time data collection, monitoring, and forecasting of
natural hazards. RISICO, the forest-fire forecasting model,
has also been integrated into the platform to demonstrate
how early warnings are issued through the system and
where early action is required. The system will assist
national and regional authorities in improving the social and
economic resilience of communities in fire-prone areas.
On the monitoring and assessment side, the risk-sensitive
budget review proved critical for tracking and promoting
DRR investments in Ethiopia.

Chapter 1 identifies seven systemic risks namely: rural/agricultural risk with rising food insecurity; systemic risk in a rapidly urbanizing region;
overdependence on natural resource extraction and non-sustainable consumption and production patterns; the COVID-19 pandemic; cyber risk in
cities with advanced infrastructure systems; emerging nuclear energy risks; and the climate change-disasters-conflict migration nexus.

UNDRR 2021 Global Assessment Special Report
on Drought: Madagascar
UNDRR’s launch of the 2021 Global Assessment
Special Report on Drought provided visible, highly
policy-relevant leadership in risk reduction. The
report draws connections between operational
insights from development and humanitarian
partners, researchers and policymakers around the
world, with practical and context-aware advice on
transformations needed to build long-term disasterrisk resilience in communities and institutions.
The report brought to life systemic approaches to
understanding risk through case studies that outline
the complex and cascading impact of drought in
various societies. Following the launch of the report,
regional offices tailored events to expand regional and
bilateral DRR partnerships.
Immediately following the regional event for Africa,
UNDRR was contacted by the UN Resident Coordinator
(UNRC) in Madagascar who expressed interest in
further applying the recommendations from the GAR
Special Report on Drought for in-country planning.

Madagascar is grappling with its worst drought in
40 years, as well as security, social, institutional and
development challenges.
Recognising the cross-cutting nature of the report
and linkages with the work of the UN Country Team
in Madagascar, the UNRC invited UNDRR and report
authors to present an overview of the report to the
entire UN Country Team, as well as to donors and
partners in early 2022. The aim of the briefing was
to align the UN’s response to the drought in southern
Madagascar with longer-term resilience-planning
across the UN System, and to identify partners at
various levels of government and the private sector
in Madagascar with similar priorities. The fact that
the delegated representative of the UN System in
Madagascar singled out the GAR Special Report on
Drought as a model for understanding and managing
the risks Madagascar faces, is a testament to
the clarity, utility and practicality of the report’s
recommendations.

GLOBAL COORDINATION AND REVIEW
MECHANISMS OF THE SENDAI FRAMEWORK
ARE IN PLACE

In 2021, UNDRR conducted consultations with
a broad range of stakeholders to ensure globallevel coordination and review mechanisms of
the Sendai Framework. The organization of
the Seventh Session of the Global Platform for
Disaster Risk Reduction (GP2022), scheduled to
take place from 23 to 28 May 2022, in Indonesia,
made significant progress, with multi-stakeholder
teams, composed of representatives of 172
different organizations, established to shape
the substantive sessions of the GP2022, while
the four Regional Platforms provided significant
regional input for the global deliberations set to
take place.

28 | UNITED NATIONS OFFICE FOR DISASTER RISK REDUCTION

An important milestone was achieved with the
adoption of General Assembly Resolution (A/
RES/76/204) on Disaster Risk Reduction in
December 2021, in which Member States agreed
to convene a Midterm Review (MTR) of the
implementation of the Sendai Framework for
Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030. The Midterm
Review will culminate in a high-level meeting of
the General Assembly in New York in 2023 and
adopt a concise and action-oriented political
declaration to renew commitment, accelerate
implementation and inform the ECOSOC Highlevel Political Forum on Sustainable Development
and the SDGs Summit at the 78th Session of the
UN General Assembly in 2023.

NATIONAL AND LOCAL DRR STRATEGIES
AND PLANS ARE DEVELOPED
AND IMPLEMENTED IN LINE WITH SENDAI
FRAMEWORK IN COHERENCE WITH CLIMATE
ACTION AND THE SDGS
NATIONAL AND LOCAL DRR
STRATEGIES (TARGET E OF
THE SENDAI FRAMEWORK)
AND DISASTER-LOSS DATABASES
By the end of 2021, 123 countries reported the
existence of national disaster risk reduction
strategies —an increase of 124 percent from
2015, when only 55 countries reported the
adoption of such strategies. This increase
was a result of growing appreciation among
countries for adopting multi-hazard approaches,
including enhanced integration with climate
change adaptation plans, and fuelled by the
COVID-19 pandemic, which led to the design
of risk-informed sustainable development
solutions. An additional factor that contributed
to the increase in numbers was the deadline set
by Member States for developing national and
local DRR strategies by 2020. UNDRR enhanced
advocacy for integrated approaches and scaledup technical assistance to countries to enable
this shift.
To this end, UNDRR initiated a comprehensive
disaster and climate risk management (CRM)
programme to incorporate adaptation and
climate information in national and local disaster
risk reduction strategies and embed riskcentred approaches into National Adaptation
Plans (NAPs). The programme — integral to
the UNDRR package of support on Target E of
establishing DRR strategies at both national and
local level — was launched in several LDCs and
32 | UNITED NATIONS OFFICE FOR DISASTER RISK REDUCTION

SIDS in Africa, Asia-Pacific, Arab States, and the
Americas and the Caribbean. Technical resources
were designed to complement national DRR
and adaptation strategy building and planning
processes, for example, Promoting Synergy and
Alignment Between Climate Change Adaptation
and Disaster Risk Reduction in the context of
National Adaptation Plans guide and the UNDRRGIZ Technical Guidance on Comprehensive
Risk Assessment and Planning in the Context of
Climate Change.
In Asia and the Pacific, UNDRR supported
Member States in strengthening their disasterloss data systems with technical assistance.
In India, UNDRR provided technical assistance
to refine the design of disaster informationmanagement systems, which included a
module on damage and loss data, geographic
disaggregation down to district level, and the
introduction of a unique disaster ID in their
National Disaster Management Information
System (NDMIS). UNDRR’s support also
enhanced decentralized disaster-loss
accounting capacities at state and district
level. In Bangladesh, UNDRR helped enhance
interoperability of data on relief, humanitarian
needs and disaster damage and loss. All 14
Pacific UN Member States self-assessed and
reported having a national plan or strategy.
Furthermore, through UNDRR support, historical
disaster-loss data was updated for 12 SIDS
and 10 territories in the Pacific, covering events
between 2016 and 2021.

In the Americas and the Caribbean, UNDRR provided
support on developing national DRR plans in alignment
with the regional Caribbean Comprehensive Disaster
Management Strategy. With UNDRR’s extensive support,
Guyana adopted its Country Work Programme for
Comprehensive Disaster Management 2021-2025 (DRR
strategy). Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, and Antigua
and Barbuda, are at the latest phase of developing their
DRR strategies, while Trinidad and Tobago will complete
the strategy by the first quarter of 2022. Grenada, St.
Kitts and Nevis, Suriname and the Bahamas launched
the process of developing national DRR strategies, which
includes situational analyses to risk-inform their strategies.
Bolivia and Uruguay were also supported with national
plans focused on biological hazards.
By the end of 2021, five countries — Guyana, Trinidad and
Tobago, Ecuador, Bolivia and Honduras — added loss and
damage data and migrated their data sets from the original
DesInventar database to the most recent DesInventarSendai version. Technical and programme teams in
several of these countries uploaded and verified data
from 2020 and earlier, while in Bolivia and Honduras they
took part in DesInventar training sessions, which triggered
the initiation of the data-collection stage.
Likewise, in Europe and Central Asia, 33 countries
reported progress on national DRR strategies through
the Sendai Framework Monitoring system, while 11
countries were using the DesInventar disaster-loss
database system. Throughout 2021, UNDRR supported
national stakeholders in Armenia, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan
and Uzbekistan on the use of peer-review strategyassessment tools to ensure national disaster risk
reduction strategies are inclusive, robust, and in line with
Sendai Framework recommendations. Overall, efforts
assisted in increasing efficiency and relevance, ensuring
sustainability, and building confidence and ownership in
the DRR agenda at national, regional and international
levels. The regional office also engaged with Albania,
Sweden, Germany, the United Kingdom, Luxembourg
and Kazakhstan on developing and revising national DRR
strategies. Country-level efforts were complemented
by the regional facilitation of technical discussions at
the European Forum for DRR and collaboration with the
European Commission on joint work plans.
In Africa, UNDRR supported Ethiopia, Uganda, Tanzania,
Zambia, Mozambique and Malawi in the collection of
disaster-loss data and in increasing the quality of data in
the national disaster-loss database. In four of the above
countries in the Southern Africa Development Community
(SADC) region, UNDRR collaborated with the Netherlands
Red Cross to enhance the use of disaster-loss data for the
setting of early-warning triggers and anticipatory action.
Five countries joined the reporting process in 2021 from
28 reporting in total, while two additional countries added
data for the Sendai Framework Monitor baseline. This
allowed UNDRR to mobilize countries on key reporting
milestones pertaining to Target E.

In the Arab States, 14 countries reported the existence of
national DRR strategies in line with the Sendai Framework,
while 10 countries reporting using the DesInventar disasterloss database system. Action centred on expediting
partnerships and providing technical support to national
counterparts and implementing partners on addressing
biological hazards, in the context of COVID-19, in national
strategies and preparedness plans in Egypt, Jordan and
Lebanon, as well as on a revision of the structure of their
respective national DRR platforms. These considered the
needs of respective governments, health stakeholders
and international partners when applying the framework
of the project Building Back Better from COVID-19 in the
Arab States: Applying the Sendai Framework for Disaster
Risk Reduction and Enabling a Prevention-Oriented and
Risk-Informed Approach. The UNDRR regional office also
mapped national policy landscapes on coherence between
DRR, climate change and the SDGs for stakeholders in
Comoros, Djibouti and Mauritania.

Disaster-loss
accounting
Over 120 countries and territories use disasterloss databases (SFM and DesInventar) managed
by UNDRR to access standardized data on 750,000
instances of disaster-related losses and damage
at national and sub-national levels. As the current
system has been in operation since 1994, UNDRR
is developing a next-generation disaster-loss
accounting system in partnership with UNDP. Part of
this process saw a UNDRR technical team conduct
a mapping and needs analysis, draw down digital
diagnostics of in-country existing disaster-data
solutions, and develop a visionary roadmap for the
new system which is central to authenticating and
validating data that can improve the functionality,
effectiveness and sustainability of future DRR
interventions.

STRATEGIC OBJECTIVE 2

MAKING CITIES RESILIENT 2030 (MCR2030)
Inspired by the United
Nations Decade of
Action, 2030 Agenda, and
Making Cities Resilient
Campaign (2010-2020),
UNDRR together with
11 Core Partners (C40 cities, ICLEI, IFRC, JICA, R-Cities,
UCLG, UN-HABITAT, UNDP, UNOPS, WCCD and the
World Bank) rolled out the Making Cities Resilient 2030
(MCR2030) initiative in 2021 as a global partnership to
accelerate local disaster risk reduction and resilience. An
ambitious and bold collaboration, MCR2030 counts on the
participation of local governments and service providers
to design and implement disaster risk reduction strategies
in urban centres. Support provided to cities includes, for
example, awareness-raising workshops and training on
disaster resilience, ways of improving risk analysis and
data management, approaches for strengthening climate,
disaster-risk governance, and fostering better cross-sector
links at municipal level, and strategies to increase city-tocity exchanges.
At global level, the MCR2030 delivery strategy is negotiated
and agreed by the Core Partners, through the Global
Coordinating Committee (GCC), and supported by the
MCR2030 Global Secretariat, which is served by UNDRR’s
Global Education and Training Institute (GETI) based in
Incheon, Republic of Korea.
By the year end, with the support of partners, 309 MCR2030
cities reported having DRR strategies in place to guide
actions to reduce risks and build resilience. In addition, 168
cities are in the stage of strengthening capacities to assess
resilience and formulating DRR and resilience strategies.
UNDRR and MCR2030 partners continued providing
technical support and training for local authorities and
stakeholders on the tools and capacity needed to develop
urban baseline resilience assessments.
Based on a post-training impact survey in 2021, UNDRR’s
training session participants incorporated DRR strategies
into their workspace, with many taking it further to amplify
DRR impact in local communities and networks. Having
MCR2030 and its resilience roadmap as an umbrella of collaboration on local resilience, the competitive advantage of
each MCR2030 partner was exercised, permitting enhanced
support to cities and municipalities in becoming inclusive,
safe, resilient, and sustainable. For example, United
Cities and Local Governments (UCLG) delivered training for
MCR2030 cities and national municipal associations, and
Local Governments for Sustainability (ICLEI) provided a
platform for the cities to share their experiences.
World Council on City Data (WCCD) is working to support
MCR2030 cities with collecting and maintaining standardised data and R-Cities empowered a number of their network
cities to become Resilience Hubs under the MCR2030.

34 | UNITED NATIONS OFFICE FOR DISASTER RISK REDUCTION

At regional level, UNDRR regional offices strengthened vertical links between national and local authorities in support
of urban resilience and promoted DRR uptake through the
MCR2030, implementation of disaster risk reduction scorecards, frameworks, training and related approaches. The
MCR2030 Regional Coordinating Committees (RCC) in each
region are responsible for coordinating and ensuring synergies among regional partners to provide technical support
to cities and empower them to progress along the resilience
roadmap. This decentralized operation is the key to ensuring
MCR2030 responds to the contextualized needs of each
region. The RCCs are supported by the Regional Secretariats
served by the respective UNDRR Regional Offices.
In the Americas and the Caribbean, nine new cities or local
governments from the region completed self-assessment
reports using the Disaster Resilience Scorecard for Cities.
For Brazil, sub-national government action was crucial
in promoting and disseminating guidelines, addenda,
technical support and tools such as DRR scorecards related
to MCR2030, helping build momentum among existing
strategic partners and strengthening local DRR and climate-

“Campinas [São Paulo,
Brazil] is recognized as an
international leader in building

In Colombia, the regional office supported capacitydevelopment events framed in a long-term collaboration
with the National Unit for Disaster Risk Management. As
a result, 589 local government officials were trained in
MCR2030. Moreover, Jamaica became the first country with
all its 14 municipal corporations signing up for MCR2030 —
an exemplary demonstration of stakeholder commitment
to disaster risk reduction and resilience-building, as well
as readiness to implement local assessment and planning
tools that contribute to meeting the Sendai Framework

Raising urban resilience
with MCR2030
Based on its proximity to the Yellow Sea and Han
River, residents of Incheon, Republic of Korea, have
contended with social and economic hardships
linked to adverse events. The city, home to 2.8
million people, has seen a rise in natural hazards
like floods, heatwaves, landslides, earthquakes,
and human-induced accidents such as industrial
fires. In response, city officials signed up to
the MCR2030 initiative and integrated disaster
risk reduction approaches across vital sectors
in ten districts, helping local administrators,
businesses, and residents ramp up disasterprevention, preparedness, and recovery efforts, and
associations with several health responses. This
move led to global acclamation for the effective
use of data, science, and technology to create
targeted preparedness and response actions to the
COVID-19 pandemic.
As a Resilience Hub, Incheon City stakeholders
committed to implementing an ambitious threeyear action plan that will further strengthen local
resilience and can inspire partner cities. “Incheon
has a long track record in innovation and dedication
to disaster risk reduction, which is why we are
glad to have it as the first Resilience Hub in the
Asia-Pacific region. [...] It will serve as a source of
inspiration and expertise in helping other cities in
the region and beyond.” Mr. Marco Toscano-Rivalta,
Chief of the Asia-Pacific Regional Office of the
UNDRR.

and SDG indicators. Additionally, three cities in the region
(Medellin, Mexico City and Campinas) demonstrated
commitment as MCR2030 Resilience Hubs. The primary
purpose of the Resilience Hubs is to enhance city-to-city
collaborations and peer-to-peer support along the resilience
journey. Resilience Hubs have a critical role in supporting
other MCR2030 cities in knowledge sharing, capacity
building and creating learning opportunities.
To accelerate MCR2030 efforts in Africa, UNDRR organized
five webinars on local DRR strategies and an urban
resilience campaign that reached over 200 representatives
from local and national agencies in Ghana, Uganda and
The Gambia in taking forward recommendations and
championing the revision of local strategies, so they are
in line with the Sendai Framework. Links between national
and local partners continued to be strengthened as
evidenced in Uganda, where the Ministry of Lands, Housing
and Urban Development mobilized participants in seven
regional cities, with a combined population of five million,
in setting up local governance resilience networks. In
2021, three cities in Uganda completed the development
of disaster risk reduction strategies based on the baseline
evidence created from the Disaster Resilience Scorecard
for Cities assessment, with support from UNDRR and Local
Governments for Sustainability (ICLEI) Africa.
Continued support from the Regional Office to national
and local governments across Africa unfolded vis-à-vis
the development of local strategies and context-relevant
training and technical support. In collaboration with UNHabitat and the Ministry of Local Government and Disaster
Risk Reduction in Mauritius, UNDRR facilitated a workshop
for local representatives on multi-stakeholder engagement,
self-assessment and strategy development to promote joint
action for building resilience and the design of local disaster
risk reduction strategies and action plans that contribute to
building the resilience of 1.2 million people. Collaboration
across networks increased support to local governments
— like the African Research and Impact Network and
Africa Smart Cities Network — in championing local DRR
strategies.
In Asia and the Pacific, partners involved in the MCR2030
received commitments from stakeholders to reduce local
disasters and climate risk, along with raising resilience
through campaign initiatives. The UNDRR Global Education
and Training Institute (GETI) and the regional office
organized webinars in Indonesia, Nepal, the Philippines and
the Republic of Korea while, in the Philippines, MCR2030
tools were used to support government priorities in
providing enhanced support to local governments on
disaster risk reduction. As a result, the Philippine Office
of Civil Defence, together with the National Disaster Risk
Reduction and Management Council, Department of
the Interior and Local Government, and Union of Local
Authorities jointly launched the national programme on
MCR2030 in October, with over 70 cities signing up to
the MCR2030 dashboard. The dashboard is a closed
online platform accessible only by users that signed up

to MCR2030. It helps to facilitate the connection and
foster exchanges and collaboration among cities and
organizations in making cities resilient.

cities and 46 regional entities in the region. Of special note,
the regional office successfully supported the establishment
of global Resilience Hubs in Barcelona, Greater Manchester,
Helsingborg and Milan — networks of innovators from
business, investment, civil society, academia and urban
development communities who are committed to mobilizing
financing and action to raise the resilience of all urbanites in
meaningful and inclusive ways.

Incheon Metropolitan City became the first city in the
region to become a MCR2030 Resilience Hub, committed
to providing capacity-building support, promoting cityto-city exchanges and opportunities for peer-to-peer
learning to MCR2030 cities. In 2021, Ningbo, Shanghai and
Beijing in the People’s Republic of China used the Disaster
Resilience Scorecard for Cities to assess their disasterresilience progress. The assessment will inform further
contextualization of MCR2030 tools, in 2022, to support
Chinese local authorities on risk-reduction and resilience.

Equal success was met in coordinating the involvement
of 15 partners in the Regional Coordinating Committee
(RCC) for Europe and Central Asia; a group comprised of
key partners like UNDP, WHO, UNECE, UN-Habitat and UNEP.
The RCC coordinated the roll-out of the MCR2030 in the
region and provided advisory support on emerging urban
trends to the Regional Secretariat as well as to the Global
Coordinating Committee of the MCR2030.

At local level in Europe and Central Asia, UNDRR oversaw
the launch and implementation of the Making Cities
Resilient 2030 initiative, bringing together 68 participating

“We use the [UNDRR]
disaster-resilience
assessment tool and
scorecard in our annual
planning and monitoring
processes, relying on it as
a source of information to
gauge where we are and our
gaps. MCR tools helped us
better organize in Makati,
structure disaster-risk
management initiatives, and
track city progress to improve
disaster resilience over time,
as well as identify priorities
for future investment and
action.”
Ms. Liza Velle B. Ramos
Head of Research and Planning Division,
Disaster Risk Reduction and Management
Office in Makati, Philippines

Through dedicated project-based engagement, UNDRR
guided MCR2030 implementation through the roll-out of
Disaster Resilience Scorecard assessments and Public
Health Resilience Scorecard assessments. To improve
collaboration with the Council of Baltic Sea States (CBSS)
in supporting Sendai Framework implementation in 11
countries, UNDRR advocated for increased engagement for
MCR2030 at CBSS regional events and the European Forum
for DRR.
In Central Asia, meanwhile, UNDRR MCR2030 support to
the three capital cities of Bishkek, Dushanbe and Nur-Sultan
inspired local stakeholders to initiate the development of
‘home-grown’ disaster-resilience strategies and action plans.
Self-assessments by 13 cities or local governments from
Europe and Central Asia are ongoing and expected to inform
and strengthen localized DRR and resilience strategies, and
support the preparation of bankable projects.

In the Arab States, engagement with local and national
administrators, private sector and civil society actors in
22 countries supported on-the-ground efforts in getting
45 cities to join MCR2030. In Somalia, UNDRR facilitated
several consultation workshops for Jowhar city to raise
awareness on disaster risk reduction, climate change and
sustainable development, and introduce the MCR2030
programme. The Disaster Resilience Scorecard for
assessing the status of cities’ DRR efforts was completed
and a resilience action plan for the city of Jowhar was
developed with a clear timeframe and set of actions to build
the resilience of the city and reduce the effects of disasters.
Additionally, three cities in Lebanon also reported assessing
disaster-resilience progress using the Disaster Resilience
Scorecard for Cities.

SCALING UP DRR IN HUMANITARIAN ACTION
In Bangladesh, UNDRR worked closely with OCHA, the
UN Resident Coordinator’s Office, and USAID to provide
support to the Bangladesh Humanitarian Country Task
Team (HCTT) on integrating risk information into four local
humanitarian policies and plans. A customized INFORMbased sub-national risk assessment was launched, covering
64 districts and 552 upazila local government units in
prioritizing DRR and humanitarian preparedness. UNDRR in
Bangladesh continues to take the lead on operationalizing
the first strategic objective (‘risk and impact analysis’) of
the HCTT NEXUS STRATEGY (2021-2025): HumanitarianDevelopment Collaboration for Climate-Related Disasters
in Bangladesh on climate-related disaster.4 The strategy
will minimize the impact of crises by enabling local
communities, government and partners in regions exposed
to cyclones, monsoons, floods and landslide regions, to act
early, minimize losses, and reduce humanitarian financing
needs.

Disaster Resilience Scorecard for Cities
Supporting cities in using the Disaster Resilience
Scorecard for Cities to identify gaps and priorities for
disaster resilience, UNDRR facilitated online training
workshops reaching over 3,900 participants from
165 countries and territories in 2021. Among the
training, a new course, ‘Build back better: Harnessing
South-South cooperation and risk reduction planning
for resilient and healthy cities in the post COVID-19

era’, in collaboration with the UN Office for SouthSouth Cooperation (UNOSSC) and World Health
Organization (WHO), reached 3,000 participants alone
from 155 countries and territories, conducted with
interpretation in six languages. Such engagement
highlights the importance of multi-stakeholder
and multi-sectoral approach for sustainable urban
development.

STRATEGIC OBJECTIVE 2

STRENGTHENED CAPACITY
OF COUNTERPARTS, UN COUNTRY TEAMS
AND PARTNERS FOR LEADERSHIP
IN DISASTER RISK REDUCTION
UNDRR capacity development programmes
continued as a central source of innovation for
national and local stakeholders, including UN
country teams that rely on UNDRR tools, projects,
and technical support to strengthen disaster
risk reduction, resilience-building capacities, and
risk-informed planning. Working with partners
across the United Nations System, UNDRR
successfully developed and customized online
training modules, greatly contributing to outreach
efforts and reaching a range of stakeholders
who could access state-of-the-art guidelines and
tools. The number of people reached through
UNDRR training programmes, webinars and
events continued to grow as online and hybrid
delivery has vastly enhanced access. The UNDRR
Global Education and Training Institute (GETI)
reached 21,920 stakeholders through 53 training
programmes, 27 events and 16 webinars in
2021. Participants represented national and local
government from 178 countries and territories,
regional intergovernmental and United Nations
organizations, academia, private sector and civil
society. 46 per cent of trainees were women.
According to a year-end survey, 75 per cent
of training participants had informally shared
acquired knowledge with colleagues, 55 per
cent applied a DRR lens in their current job,
and 49 per cent formally upcycled information
in other meetings, training, and events. With
2021 being the second year of the pandemic,
40 per cent reported having used their newfound DRR knowledge to contribute to local
COVID-19 response and recovery plans, while 58
per cent led or took part in consultations with
local governments and a further 42 per cent
within ministries or institutional departments.
38 | UNITED NATIONS OFFICE FOR DISASTER RISK REDUCTION

In improving the quality and quantity of Sendai
Framework contributions to Target E (and SDGs
1, 11 and 13), 59 per cent of participants did both
and helped incorporate them in the development
or revision of local and national disaster risk
reduction strategies.
UNDRR rolled out a training package on
Integrating Disaster Risk Reduction and
Climate Change Adaptation into UN Sustainable
Development Cooperation Frameworks
(UNSCDFs) reaching over 500 representatives
of UN Resident Coordinator Offices, UN Country
Teams, and in-country partners in 36 countries.
In Asia and the Pacific, UNDRR customized
sessions on climate and disaster risk reduction
for the UN Country Teams (UNCTs) engaged in
developing the Common Country Analysis (CCA)
and UNSDCFs, such as Nepal, Thailand and
Maldives. UNDRR, UNEP, OHCHR, and UN Women,
as part of human-rights-based approach training,
delivered joint webinar sessions on climate and
the multi-dimensional risk analysis in the Maldives
and Thailand that, as a result, gave UNCTs greater
insight into how risk-blind development solutions
can affect progress in other areas as outcomes
cascade across social, economic and ecological
systems.
UNDRR also worked with the Asia-Pacific IssueBased Coalition (IBC) on Building Resilience in
advocating at the 77th session of the Economic
and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific
(ESCAP) for improved national multi-hazard
disaster risk governance. As a result, Member
States agreed in April 2021 to a resolution
(ESCAP Resolution 77/1) that called for better

In 2021, the regional office in the Americas and the
Caribbean provided technical support, training, and
guidance to UNCTs in the revision of 11 CCAs and
UNSDCFs. UNDRR staff facilitated training on embedding
DRR in the UNSDCFs and merging DRR considerations into
CCAs and the humanitarian-development-peace nexus
in El Salvador, Guyana, Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and
Bolivia. In addition, UNDRR regional programme officers
delivered six training sessions on programmatic principles
for UNCT members that highlighted the integration of
DRR and climate change adaptation when developing
new cooperation frameworks in Honduras, Peru, the
multi-country Office for Eastern Caribbean, Costa Rica,
Dominican Republic and Ecuador. Regionally, the IBC on
Climate Change and Resilience, co-led by UNDRR and UNEP,
spearheaded strategies for disaster risk and climate change
analysis and planning tools to support the risk-informed
2030 agenda for sustainable development, as well as the
dissemination of common messages that highlight DRR and
climate change adaptation strategies.
UNDRR also published the IBC technical report, Wildfires
in Latin America: A preliminary analysis, messages and
resources for RC/UNCT led by UNDRR, UNEP, FAO and
WMO with the participation of WHO, OCHA, WFP, ILO, UNDP,
UNFCCC, IOM, ECLAC and UNICEF. The report seeks to
provide United Nations Country Teams with a regional
analytical perspective and resources to better understand
and address the issue of wildfires in their different contexts.
The IBC contributed to the organization and the contents
of the 11th UN-CARICOM General Meeting with substantive
inputs to highlight disaster risk and resilience in its resulting
statement.

UNDRR also continued to co-lead the Task Team on DRR
and Climate Change Adaptation for the IBC on Environment
and Climate Change in Europe, coordinating the production
of a regional review of good practices on the integration of
DRR and climate change adaptation for risk-informed and
climate-smart development. Published and introduced to
UNCTs in the region in 2021, the paper was built on UNDRR’s
2020 Guidance Note on Using Climate and Disaster Risk
Management to Help Build Resilient Societies.
In Africa, stakeholder commitments reinforced the
inclusion of DRR and resilience-related activities for
projects in the region. UNDRR supported the development
and implementation of joint workplans in collaboration
with UNCTs in the context of the UNSDCFs in Ethiopia,
Madagascar and Nigeria. Following requests from the
UN Development Coordination Office, as members of the
Peer Support Group, UNDRR provided technical inputs and
quality-assurance feedback to Kenya, Mozambique, Malawi,
The Gambia and Zimbabwe, to support the reviews of their
common country analyses.
In the Arab States, the UNDRR regional office published
a policy brief on Health System Resilience and Building
Back Better from COVID-19 in close cooperation with WHO
Regional Office for the Eastern Mediterranean, the IBC on
Food Security, Climate and the Environment, League of Arab
States, WHO country offices and national Sendai Framework
focal points in the region. The brief was presented during a
special session on reducing disaster risk in health sectors at
the 5th Arab Regional Platform for DRR.

In Europe and Central Asia, UNDRR continued to give
technical assistance to 18 UNCTs through dedicated focal
points and results groups for UNSDCF development and
implementation. In Moldova and Serbia, UNDRR contributed
to raising local health and disaster resilience by supporting
localized UN Socio-Economic Response and Recovery Plans
for COVID-19 and the uptake of public-health addendum
scorecards. Furthermore, UNDRR and the UNDP Regional
Hub published a joint study in February on the Impact of
COVID-19 on National Disaster Management Agencies
in the Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent
States (ECIS) region on the activities of national disastermanagement agencies in the region, which served as
the basis for targeted events with the UNCTs, Sendai
Framework focal points in the ECIS region, and European
Forum for DRR.

STRATEGIC OBJECTIVE 2

2015-2030 in Africa (adopted by the African Union Heads
of State and Government in January 2017), the Nairobi
Declaration demonstrates the strong commitment
stakeholders have made to disaster risk reduction
and resilience-building in Africa to date, and provides
actionable steps towards accelerating Sendai Framework
implementation across the continent.

2.3

REGIONAL AND NATIONAL COORDINATION
MECHANISMS ARE MOBILIZED
TO ACCELERATE SF IMPLEMENTATION

UNDRR contributed to accelerating the
implementation of the Sendai Framework at
regional level through a series of interventions.
In November 2021, UNDRR in the Americas and
the Caribbean held its 7th Regional Platform for
DRR to accelerate stakeholder understanding
of disaster risk reduction and incentivize future
action. The platform featured 200 panellists over
38 sessions and was streamed by 52,000 people
in 85 countries. Preceded by the Youth Forum for
Disaster Risk Reduction, concrete commitments
emerged from the Regional Platform to ensure
young people are included in collective efforts to
reduce disaster risk and build resilience.
The high-level segment resulted in the acceptance
of a ministerial declaration that emphasizes the
multi-stakeholder nature of DRR and highlights
the importance of inclusivity in projects to
ensure no one is left behind. Moreover, the event
supported women in taking on active leading
and speaking roles -- resulting in 53 per cent
female participation, including 22 (co)chairs, 103
speakers, 12 in other leading roles (moderators or
facilitators), and women comprising 48 per cent of
total speakers.
The regional platform resulted in the adoption of
a revised regional action plan for implementing
the Sendai Framework and a roadmap of regional
priorities to advance DRR.
UNDRR is also implementing a regional
programme on Strengthening HydroMeteorological and Early Warning Services in the
Caribbean to strengthen and streamline regional
and national early-warning services and capacity.
As a result of this project, a draft of the regional

Furthermore, UNDRR and UNESCO continued to co-lead
the subgroup on building climate and disaster resilience
under one of the seven Opportunity/Issue Based Coalitions
(OIBCs)-OIBC 5-Fostering Climate Action and Resilience.
This made it possible for participating UN organizations to
improve the quality of coordinated and coherent support
provided to the African Union Commission, Regional
Economic Communities, and Member States to implement

the above-mentioned regional programme, which is the
main flagship initiative of OIBC 5.
In the Arab States, the 5th Arab Regional Platform for
Disaster Risk Reduction under the theme From Risk to
Resilience: Accelerating Local Action for Disaster Risk
Reduction, was hosted virtually by the Government of the
Kingdom of Morocco and co-organized by the UNDRR
regional office and the League of Arab States (LAS) in
November. More than 100 experts and 500 participants
from 55 countries gathered at ministerial level to attend the
inclusive and interactive platform, comprising 25 sessions.
The outcomes will inform the 2022 High-Level Political
Forum on Sustainable Development in New York and the
2022 Global Platform for Disaster Risk Reduction.

Multi-hazard Early Warning Systems (MHEWS)
Roadmap was developed and shared with regional
stakeholders (Caribbean Disaster Emergency
Management Agency (CDEMA), Caribbean
Institute of Meteorology and Hydrology (CIMH)
and Caribbean Meteorological Organization
(CMO)). The roadmap identifies nine Strategic
Initiatives to accelerate progress on MHEWS,
notably on the transition from traditional EWS to
Impact-Based Forecasting (IBF).
UNDRR, as the Secretariat of the Africa Working
Group on Disaster Risk Reduction, supported
the African Union Commission to organize two
regular sessions of the Africa Working Group
on DRR – a principal continental mechanism for
DRR that provides technical and coordination
support to implement the Sendai Framework in
Africa. The Group also provided a platform for
all stakeholders to advocate for a coherent and
integrated approach to disaster risk reduction,
climate change and sustainable actions, as well
as consideration of disaster risk reduction in
COVID-19 response and recovery initiatives.
Moreover, in Africa, UNDRR, in collaboration
with the African Union Commission and the
Intergovernmental Authority on Development,
organized the 8th Africa Regional Platform for
DRR and the 7th High-Level meeting on Disaster
Risk Reduction (16-19 November 2021) that was
hosted by the Government of Kenya, where the
Nairobi Declaration was adopted by Member
State representatives. Building on progress
achieved under the Tunis Declaration, adopted at
the previous regional platform in 2018, and the
Programme of Action for the Implementation of
the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction
VII Regional Platform for Disaster Risk Reduction in the Americas and the Caribbean (RP21).

recovery practices. The United Nations and OECD also
organized a global seminar on DRR following the Beirut port
explosion in 2020. UNDRR and members of the Lebanese
DRM Unit in the Council of Ministers facilitated discussions
between 30 different national stakeholders on adopting a
multi-hazard approach to DRR that mainstreams disasterrisk management of technological hazards into national,
local, and sector strategies and plans.

The virtual Asia-Pacific Partnership for Disaster Risk
Reduction Forum held in December brought together 200
participants and representatives from 23 Member States,
intergovernmental organizations, stakeholder groups and
NGOs, who shared information on progress and challenges
in the region with a specific focus on financing disaster
risk reduction, alignment with the Sendai Framework, and
ways of ensuring inclusive and comprehensive approaches
to risk management. Throughout the year, UNDRR support
to the Pacific Island Forum Secretariat (PIFS) resulted in
the adoption of the Pacific Resilience Standards, which
support the operationalization of the 10 Guiding Resilience
Principles for the region and accompanies the launch of
pilot projects in Tonga and the Marshall Islands. Together
with UNDP, UNDRR also advanced the Issue-Based Coalition
on Building Resilience through the development of a policy
brief, ‘Climate and disaster resilient infrastructure: Building
resilience to future uncertainties and shocks’, and with the
International Organization for Migration (IOM) developed a
research publication on weathering the storms: COVID-19,
disasters and internal displacement in the Asia-Pacific.

Science and technology DRR investments ensure
no one is left behind
Extreme climate events have compounded existing
social and economic crises in Lebanon, overburdening
the public and private sectors and affecting entire
communities. Since 2019, more households
have fallen below the poverty line and individuals
lack access to essential services, resources, job
opportunities, institutional support or utilities.
Communities are affected by economic adversity,
sector stagnation, COVID-19-related restrictions
and unstable markets, while youth, women, girls
and refugees have been hit the hardest and remain
vulnerable to disasters, humanitarian emergencies
and extreme environmental events.
In response, national and local stakeholders
collaborated with UNDRR to prioritize disaster
risk reduction (DRR) in emergency and recovery
interventions. For example, the Hariri Foundation
for Sustainable Human Development is a civilsociety organization that took the lead in designing
and implementing DRR initiatives in Lebanon with
technical support from UNDRR. The Foundation
collaborates with stakeholders when using science,
technology, engineering and maths (STEM) as entry
points to raise civil-society awareness on the SDGs
and 2030 Agenda, and to ensure Sendai Framework
indicators are embedded in localized DRR plans and
activities.
Along with its focus on youth involvement, the
Hariri Foundation collaborated with the National
Disaster Risk Management Unit to better align local
frameworks and activities with the Sendai Framework

The 2021 European Forum for Disaster Risk Reduction
(EFDRR) held in November, welcomed 1,250 virtual
participants and delegations from 49 European and Central
Asian Member States. During the Ministerial Roundtable,
governments endorsed the EFDRR Roadmap 2021-2030
and its four priority areas,5 to accelerate the implementation
of the Sendai Framework and related SDGs targets in
Europe and Central Asia. The roadmap lays out challenges,
lessons, opportunities and pathways for incentivizing and
supporting more risk-informed and inclusive regional,
national and local DRR policies, strategies and actions for
regional collaboration and information sharing. Developed
by the EFDRR working group comprising 13 Member States,
recommendations include four collective pathways to
achieving the four Sendai Framework priorities for action,
16 common action areas for development and investment,
and five enabling approaches for shaping a more disasterresilient region by 2030.

and embed STEM-based equity and gender principles
in all DRR processes with the aim of empowering
women and young people to make meaningful
contributions.
Local DRR programmes were inspired by global
solutions and modified to fit within the Lebanese
context. Working across sectors, the Hariri
Foundation and local collaborators incorporated
practical STEM solutions and advocated for national
and local gender-sensitive policies, communication
and initiatives. Investing in science and technology
— with a focus on leaving no one behind — is central
to the country’s future and informing a new wave of
intersectional programming that covers education
and empowerment, socio-economic development,
governance, state building and crisis response.
Stakeholder engagement has been integral to
embedding these concepts in local priorities, as well
as in coordinating projects, mobilizing financing,
improving cross-sector network reach, and rolling out
multi-dimensional approaches that feature women
and youth as primary investors in community and
market development, policy research, policymaking,
and the design of sustainable, urban socio-economic
recovery plans. In 2022, Hariri Foundation members
will use their relationships to increase participation
rates of women, youth and other marginalized
groups in local DRR efforts. There are also plans
to use data collection and analysis support to help
shape local human-resource management and
expand consultative processes with stakeholders,
and endorse recommendations for public-health
resilience action plans in three major Lebanese cities.

Additionally in Europe, UNDRR supported coordination
mechanisms by increasing engagement in developing
national platforms in Albania, Turkmenistan and Slovakia,
revamping said platforms in Belgium, Finland and
Luxembourg, and increasing stakeholder participation in
national platform processes in France, Portugal, Kyrgyzstan
and Tajikistan. To date, 38 countries in the region are now
equipped with DRR-coordination mechanisms. Meanwhile,
in Central Asia, government partners resolved to develop
and strengthen coordination at sub-regional level through
the adoption of the Regional DRR Strategy for 2022-2030
and roadmap for its implementation.

During a special session of the Regional Platform, UNDRR
organized a regional dialogue on ‘Health and DRR in
post-COVID context’ in collaboration with WHO-EMRO.
The dialogue provided an opportunity for participants to
enhance capacities across the Arab Region by advancing
the integration of biological hazards in DRR strategies,
emphasizing the importance of national DRR strategy
alignment with long-term development efforts and global
initiatives and incentivize sustainable health-system

The four core areas include understanding and communicating risk,
disaster risk governance, risk-informed investments, and preparedness

STRATEGIC OBJECTIVE 3

3.1

POLICY COHERENCE, IN LINE WITH
THE SENDAI FRAMEWORK, FOSTERED
ACROSS INTERGOVERNMENTAL DECISIONS
RELATED TO CLIMATE ACTION
AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
INTERGOVERNMENTAL DECISIONS
2021 was an important year for intergovernmental
policy setting on disaster risk reduction. UNDRR
scaled-up its efforts on risk-informed policy
in intergovernmental deliberations and their
outcomes, to address existing gaps, lower
risk, raise resilience and promote preventative
measures that recognise disaster risk reduction as
essential to the achievement of the 2030 Agenda.
The UNDRR New York Liaison Office continued
to provide policy advice to Member States on
intergovernmental deliberations in the General
Assembly and the Economic and Social Council
(ECOSOC) with demonstrable results. Some
13 intergovernmental outcome documents,
released in 2021, integrated DRR and provided
intergovernmental guidance for risk-informed
policy-setting and action at national level.
Prevention of, and preparedness for, major global
risks were also embedded in the SecretaryGeneral’s report on Our Common Agenda, which
provides strategic recommendations for Member
States and the UN System to boost the 2030
Agenda.

CLIMATE ACTION AND SUSTAINABLE
DEVELOPMENT

and displacement, as well as highlighted the specific
vulnerabilities facing those in LDCs, landlocked low-income
countries and SIDS.

At COP26 in Glasgow, UNDRR advocated for action based
on three central messages: dramatically raising ambition
for reducing and managing risks due to climate change;
significantly increasing support for averting, minimizing
and addressing losses and damages; and accelerating
predictable and risk-informed investments and financing.
Messages resonated strongly at pavilions and side events
with United Nations, CSO, government, and private-sector
partners reinforcing the UNDRR stance and sharing it
within their communications, statements, and good
practices. At Glasgow, UNDRR organized or co-led events
on topics including accelerating adaptation actions,
comprehensive risk management, risk-informed earlywarning and anticipatory tools, urban and coastal resilience

UNDRR was a core partner of the first ever Water Pavilion
in the Blue Zone of the COP, led by a steering committee
of the Swedish International Water Institute (SIWI). UNDRR
curated the disaster risk reduction theme of the pavilion that
featured eight sessions on diverse topics related to water
and disasters. Similarly, UNDRR also curated the disaster
risk reduction theme of the Resilience Hub, convened by the
Global Resilience Partnership.
During regional Climate Week, events held in the Americas
and the Caribbean (May), Asia and the Pacific, (July)
and Africa (September), countries and DRR stakeholders,
highlighted the need for integrated climate action into global
pandemic recovery.

Supporting Member States in mainstreaming
disaster risk reduction as a guiding principle
of the Doha Programme of Action for Least
Developed Countries (LDCs) was a high point for
the organization in 2021. The new Programme of
Action promotes technical support and capacity
development to LDCs in the pursuit of riskinformed structural economic transformation
and sustainable-development strategies, with
commitments and targets aligned to the Sendai
Framework. These actions were amplified by the
ECOSOC resolution that encourages graduating
LDCs to embed DRR into smooth transition
strategies to ensure a sustainable graduation.

The Gender Equality and Women’s Empowerment Voluntary Stakeholder Group for DRR in the Arab States organized a webinar on Gender, Climate Change and Migration:

Collaborative action and strengthened
coordination among UN System partners
contributing to reducing risk, were central to
UNDRR’s work and processes in 2021. As the focal
point for disaster risk reduction within the United
Nations development system, UNDRR coordinated
efforts at global, regional,6 and national levels,
building on existing coordination mechanisms.
UNDRR coordinated and chaired the UN Senior
Leadership Group on DRR for Resilience (UN
SLG) and UN Disaster Risk Reduction Focal Points
Group, comprised of 43 UN entities committed
to jointly moving the DRR agenda forward, to
enhance implementation of the UN Plan of Action
on Disaster Risk Reduction for Resilience 6 (UN
Plan of Action).

This platform advanced global discussions on
the COVID-19 pandemic and other disasters.
UNDRR strongly endorsed the IRP Help Desk and
provided technical guidance on the uptake of new
programming methods related to assessment,
planning, financing and management evidence
from recovery.
Progress on gender-responsive DRR action
was recognised through implementation of the
nine United Nations recommendations in the
Gender Equality and Women’s Empowerment and
Leadership in Disaster Risk Reduction (GEWELDRR) report, coordinated by UNDRR, UNFPA, and
UN Women with support from an additional 20
United Nations entities.

UNDRR continued to jointly coordinate the
International Recovery Platform (IRP) to
incentivize national and local partners to build
back better in recovery, rehabilitation and
reconstruction, through the promotion and
implementation of Sendai Framework Priority 4.7

A mapping of capacities to risk-inform humanitarian action
further contributed to strengthening interagency engagement
and addressing gaps in humanitarian actors’ capacity on
DRR.
UNDRR also played an active role in the UN Food
Systems Summit under the Resilience Action Track (AT5),
mainstreaming comprehensive risk-management approaches
to food-systems resilience with special considerations for
climate and non-climate risks. Also emphasized was local
action and indigenous knowledge, and the promotion of
whole-of-society approaches that bring together governments,
civil society, the private sector and communities on foodsystem resilience.

“As a farmer, training on
weather forecasts allowed me
to improve my situation and
what I grow. It allowed me to
have something so I could
take care of my family and
[…] it means that everything
is planned so we don’t
waste time or money. The
difference is indisputable, […]
but everyone knows old ways
are no longer possible with
climate change. You have to
adapt.”

At the Summit, UNDRR chaired a working group on multirisk and crisis management for 25 UN System agencies,
NGO and CSO representatives, who devised solutions
for risk-proofing food systems: anticipatory action, risk
governance, risk-resilient infrastructure, vulnerability and
risk reduction at farm level.
Similarly, in the last quarter of the year, UNDRR led an
independent, global webinar on food-systems resilience,
with over 200 participants from agricultural and DRR
sectors. The high-level panel featured the UNDRR SRSG,
WMO Secretary General, high-level representatives from
FAO and IFAD and youth ambassadors. Speakers and
facilitators highlighted the importance of improving
knowledge on multi-hazard, complex and cascading
risks in agri-food systems, and the urgent need to adopt
integrated and multidisciplinary approaches — shifting
away from crisis and disaster management to risk
management for raised resilience.

The CREWS collaboration with UNDRR led to the
finalization of weather, climate and water-focused
components of National Strategic Plans in Pacific
and Caribbean countries. Once fully endorsed and
implemented, these plans will inform approaches to
improving 12 hydrometeorological and early-warning
governance systems that serve 2.3 million island-state
residents in the Pacific and 18 million in the Caribbean
— a fundamental building block for reducing disaster
risk and saving the lives and livelihoods of those most
vulnerable to the impacts of extreme weather and
climate change.

UNDRR and CREWS improved existing tools and
approaches for measuring the effectiveness of earlywarning systems and services, introducing twenty
custom indicators that calibrate the effectiveness
of single, cluster and multi-hazard early-warning
services with computational methods of analysing and
processing data that can be used alongside the Sendai
Framework Monitor.

IMPLEMENTATION OF THE SENDAI
FRAMEWORK AND COHERENCE ACROSS
AGENDA 2030 FACILITATED THROUGH
THE PROMOTION AND IMPLEMENTATION
OF AN ALL-OF-SOCIETY APPROACH

The Sendai Framework Voluntary Commitments online
platform, operated by UNDRR, continued to catalyse
stakeholders and monitor actions by allowing stakeholders
to showcase their work, monitor their commitments, and
track progress on deliverables. Voluntary commitments
by stakeholders grew throughout 2021. By the end of
2021, the online platform published 94 VCs, which are
being implemented jointly by 595 organizations and
have committed to a total of more than 430 concrete
deliverables. More than 50 per cent of these committed
deliverables have been reported as delivered. The SFVC
platform serves as a key tool in promoting accountability
of non-stake actors and the main reference point for
information about stakeholder’s efforts to implement the
Sendai Framework.
In 2021, UNDRR collaborated with stakeholders to provide
evidence-based analyses and knowledge products to foster
inclusive risk-informed development across several sectors.

Highlights included: the efficacy of existing vulnerabilityand-exposure classification systems by researchers from
the GRAF Working Group on Vulnerability and Exposure;
a briefing paper on systemic risk with partners at
International Science Council (ISC); a study on COVID-19
as the manifestation of systemic risk; a briefing paper on
digital public goods for DRR in partnership with the World
Bank’s Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery
(GFDRR); and another analysis on anticipatory action and
finance in collaboration with UN OCHA. Such studies and
publications filled critical gaps in global knowledge on
the drivers, causes, and nature of risk, alongside countermeasures and solutions.
While all stakeholder groups were supported through
the SEM, the following outlines engagement with
key stakeholder groups in 2021: the private sector,
parliamentarians, the science and technology community,
women, persons with disabilities, and children and youth.

In 2021, UNDRR continued to promote an all-ofsociety approach, strengthening engagement
of different segments of society to promote the
DRR agenda for resilience. Throughout the year,
UNDRR increased engagement and investor
cooperation through a variety of stakeholder
groups, including with the private and financial
sectors, parliamentarians, science and technology,
women, youth, people with disabilities and across
community-led organizations, in an all-inclusive
approach, as well as advocacy at key global and
regional meetings.

The UNDRR Stakeholder Engagement Mechanism
(SEM) grew in membership to 390 Members from
76 countries, and continued as a key mechanism
in the High-Level Political Forum, the United
Nations central platform for follow-up and review
of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
The SEM also engaged in other critical areas,
including urban resilience (through the World
Urban Forum), food security (through the UN Food
Systems Summit), climate (through COP26) and
financing for DRR, issuing position statements,
reflecting progress in overcoming existing siloed
approaches between agendas.
Through the SEM, the Youth network also engaged
in the 2021 High-level Political Forum (HLPF) and
Financing for Development Forum, as well as
providing inputs for the Food Systems Summit and
COP26.

STRATEGIC OBJECTIVE 3

PRIVATE SECTOR
UNDRR continued to strengthen private-sector engagement
through ARISE—the UNDRR flagship vehicle for privatesector collaboration, which grew to over 400 registered
members from 29 national and regional networks. In
October 2021, UNDRR, in collaboration with the International
Cooperative and Mutual Insurance Federation (ICMIF),
launched the report ‘Opportunities for delivering riskinformed investment: Addressing the barriers’, offering
eight comprehensive areas where stakeholders can take
immediate action to incorporate disaster risk into their
investment decisions.
With new partners joining ARISE in the Arab States,
opportunities for financing and launching comprehensive
initiatives in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)
resilience, resilient infrastructure, insurance and riskinformed investments increased, with the establishment of
ARISE Egypt launched on 25 October. Additionally, UNDRR
and ARISE United Arab Emirates (UAE) brought together
real-estate developers and regulators from the public sector
to discuss resilience of the real-estate sector through
conducting an exploratory roundtable discussion.
UNDRR also supported ARISE UAE engagement on a
special session for the private sector during the Arab Forum
for Sustainable Development 2021 (AFSD-2021), under
the theme Catalyzing Private Sector Engagement in the
Decade of Action. The dialogue aimed to identify the most
pressing challenges facing SMEs today in the region, the

critical components to developing a business-resilience
framework, and the tools required to leverage public-private
partnerships to support business continuity and resilience.
In Asia and the Pacific, private-sector partners, particularly
ARISE in India, the Philippines and Japan, were crucial
for ensuring voices within the DRR sector were heard
and incorporated into the Asia-Pacific Action Plan for
Implementation of the Sendai Framework (2021-2024).
Inclusion efforts extended to reaching out to small and
medium-sized enterprises in India and the Philippines
through the translation of UNDRR’s online small-business
Quick Risk Estimation Tool into Filipino, Hindi and Odiya.
UNDRR strengthened the uptake of ARISE in the Americas
and the Caribbean by providing technical assistance to
21 national and three regional networks piloting ARISEpriority-specific projects in Argentina, Panama and Uruguay.
ARISE Americas increased regional outreach by managing
platforms and spaces for exchange and collaboration
between both public and private regional and national DRR
changemakers.
ARISE network members launched 12 projects focusing on
SME resilience, insurance and resilient infrastructure. These
actions led to: increased peer-to-peer collaboration and
network expansion; development of financial and business
tools for promoting resilience; an increase in the number of
public-private partnerships; greater science and technology
involvement; the creation and launch of critical assessment,
risk mapping and data collection tools; improved alignment
of local action with global priorities.

ARISE
ARISE - the Private Sector Alliance for Disaster
Resilient Societies, a network of private-sector
entities led by the UNDRR – mobilizes and facilitates
the private sector to carry out risk-informed
investments and to apply business practices that
reduce and prevent the creation of risk, build
resilience, and enhance recovery from disasters, in
line with the Sendai Framework.
The launching event of ARISE Egypt served as an
opportunity to establish the foundations of the
network. ARISE Egypt aims at enhancing the

54 | UNITED NATIONS OFFICE FOR DISASTER RISK REDUCTION

resilience of small and medium-sized enterprises
(SMEs), integrating disaster and climate risk into
investment decisions by the financial sector, and
supporting resilient infrastructure development.
“ARISE Egypt will play a pivotal role in engaging
the private sector and non-governmental business
organizations in the Arab and African countries,”
Ali Helmy Eissa, Chairman of the Board, Egyptian
Businessmen’s Association said. “The exchange of
best practices with various international organizations
will have the greatest positive impact on creating a
more resilient and strong business community.

The private sector actively engaged in disaster risk
reduction in Africa by way of focused financing. In June
2021, ARISE Africa pinpointed actionable steps to better
promote climate-resilient infrastructure investments across
the continent, while UNDRR, ARISE, Private Financing
Advisory Network, Global Compact South Africa, and
RBN Fund representatives workshopped ideas with African
thought leaders and DRR stakeholders to take forward
when building climate-resilient infrastructure to harnesses
private-sector support. These ideas were taken from
concept to practice when, in July 2021, ARISE Africa held
its first Resilience Dialogue to address SME responses to
the eruption of Nyiragongo volcano in Goma, Democratic
Republic of Congo (DRC).
UNDRR also continued engagement with the Insurance
Development Forum (IDF), a public-private partnership
led by the insurance industry, aimed at optimising and
extending the use of insurance and its related riskmanagement capabilities to build greater resilience and
protection for people, communities, businesses and public
institutions that are vulnerable to disasters and their
associated economic shocks.
The collaboration led to the joint establishment of the
Global Resilience Index Initiative (GRII), a multi- partner
initiative launched during the COP26 Adaptation Day on 8th
November under the patronage of Mark Carney, UN Special
Envoy on Climate Action and Finance; SRSG Mami Mizutori
and Eric Andersen, President, Aon, Member and Risk
Modelling Champion IDF Steering Committee.

“Resilient societies can
only be achieved if local
stakeholders are involved in
developing and implementing
plans and actions. We must
also include cooperation
with the private sector,
which is essential to
accelerate finance and derisk investment. Genderresponsive and gendertransformative approaches
must be a fundamental part
of our work.”
Ms. Anne Beathe Tvinnereim
Minister of International Development,
Norway.

The GRII draws upon significant cross-sector risk-modelling
experience, including public-private partnerships between
governments, academia, insurance and engineering,
a world’s first curated, open-source reference index,
addressing the data emergency that is contributing to the
climate crisis.
UNDRR also collaborated with the Munich Re Foundation
for the 2021 RISK Awards, set up to help improve risk
reduction and disaster management by providing financial
support to projects. The 2021 RISK Award focussed on
nature-based solutions that highlight the importance of
social and economic stability. The grant was awarded to
the project Strong roots, strong women: My Pham, Director
of Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) and
Philip Bubeck, University of Potsdam, aimed at empowering
women for community and coastal-ecosystem resilience.

PARLIAMENTARIANS
UNDRR’s engagement with parliaments and
parliamentarians continued to play a crucial role in
bridge-building between the government, civil society
and constituents. Key progress included strengthened
commitment, understanding and capacity of
parliamentarians for DRR through publication of the
‘Disaster risk reduction to achieve the SDGs: a toolkit for
parliamentarians’. The toolkit, developed in partnership
with the International Parliamentarian Union (IPU), saw
an extensive consultation process with parliamentarians
across the globe and outlined 10 concrete actions that
parliamentarians can employ to influence and implement
DRR policy, legal, financial and oversight frameworks
effectively. The toolkit was disseminated at key events in
2021, including The First Global Parliamentary Meeting
on Achieving the SDGs, which took place from 28 to 31
September 2021, and the 143rd IPU assembly in November
2021.

STRATEGIC OBJECTIVE 3

In addition, UNDRR took part in the launch of the Climate
Vulnerable Forum (CVF) Global Parliamentary Group
in October. The group aims to enable parliamentarians
from across the CVF Member States to share valuable
experiences and good practices on legislative measures in
support of ambitious climate action. By working with the
parliamentarians engaged in the group, for example at the
CVF Global Parliamentarians Meeting: Parliamentarians
of Climate Threatened Nations Championing Planetary
Prosperity event, UNDRR enhanced the focus of legislators
on the need for accelerated climate and DRR in most
vulnerable countries.

SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
UNDRR convened the first global annual meeting of all
regional Scientific and Technical Advisory Groups (STAGs)
to coordinate research priorities, programming and
planning. This annual meeting brought together delegations
from five regional STAGs and UNDRR to plan for substantive
progress in the implementation of a cross-cutting research
agenda from 2021 to 2030. The STAGs are an important
part of UNDRR’s promotion of new research and methods to
understand and reduce risk and the connection of that work
to policy makers in the interest of evidence-informed risk
reduction.

“Given the influx of
knowledge, networks and
passion, young people have
rightly commandeered niches
in policy design circles.They
offer unique and innovative
ways of implementing,
tracking and evaluating DRR
initiatives.”
Ms. Maryanne Muriuki
AYAB member and Disaster Risk and
Vulnerability Assessment Officer for ILICIT
Africa.

In the Americas and the Caribbean, UNDRR jointly launched
the Latin American Women Network with UN Women
and the Global Network of Civil Society Organizations for
Disaster Reduction (GNDR), with over 800 women enrolled
in the region. The office also supported regional and
global activities aimed at disability-inclusive DRR and the
continuation of a Latin American and Caribbean Disability
Inclusive DRR Network.

PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES
Persons with disabilities are often disproportionally
affected by disasters, and have different and uneven
levels of resilience and capacity to recover. In 2021,
partners at regional level publicly championed disaster risk
reduction policies that advanced inclusive and accessible
early-warning initiatives. Stakeholders advocated for
the meaningful participation of people with disabilities
at forums and side events on risk communication and
disaster resilience. Throughout the year, UNDRR flagged the
importance of accessible and integrated disability-friendly
risk projects and succeeded in boosting engagement with
partners such as Climate, Risk, and Early Warning System
(CREWS) as they raised the profile of disability stakeholder
groups, expanded disability networks, and endeavoured to
improve gender equality and disability inclusion across the
early-warning and action value chain.
In the preparation of the Regional Platforms for DRR,
disability groups from the respective regions and youth
representatives were consulted and engaged in the
development of session content and facilitated side events
on disability-centred DRR.

UNDRR also established the UNDRR Friends of DRR
Parliamentary Group, in Europe, as a key network to improve
integration of DRR in EU legislative and parliamentary
frameworks. Through the group, UNDRR secured DRRlanguage and Sendai Framework references in the European
Parliament COP26 resolution, as well as in EU legislation,
such as in the EU Climate Change Adaptation Strategy and
Sustainable Finance Strategy. There was also increased
engagement of parliamentarians in DRR integration in the
private sector and finance sector, for example through
MPs’ participation in the webinar on supporting DRR and
resilience practices in small and medium-sized enterprises
(SMEs), as well as continued engagement of the UNDRR
SRSG in key parliamentarian events, including the GLOBE
COP26 Legislators Summit in November 2021.

Regionally, the European Science and Technology Advisory
Group (E-STAG) published the E-STAG European Union
analysis of COVID-19 recovery plans, examining the
steps taken to achieve a green and resilient recovery for
Europe. E-STAG also contributed technical inputs to the
recently published UNDRR/International Science Council
Hazard Information Profiles. Key recommendations

the Americas and the Caribbean were also developed
by UNDRR with the Regional Science and Technology
Advisory Group (RSTAG). The report, to be published in
2022, presents findings on the effect and significant role of
scientific and technological research on strengthening the
implementation and formulation of sound DRR policies.

WOMEN’S LEADERSHIP AND GENDERRESPONSIVE DISASTER RISK REDUCTION

CHILDREN AND YOUTH

In its first full year of implementation, the Women’s
International Network for Disaster Risk Reduction (WIN
DRR) grew significantly, with 418 new members and the
establishment of a national network with more than 100
members in Indonesia. The inaugural WIN DRR Leadership
Awards, which seek to recognise women’s achievements
in disaster risk reduction, received 153 nominations from
22 countries. The Excellence Award, proudly sponsored by
SM Prime, was granted to Vasiti Soko, the Director of the
National Disaster Management Office in Fiji, while the Rising
Star Award went to Dr. Nuraini Rahma Hanifa, an earthquake
scientist who founded the U-INSPIRE Alliance to bring
together young professionals in science, engineering and
technology with the intention of reducing disaster risk. WIN
DRR is supported by the Government of Australia.

Children and young people are particularly vulnerable to
disaster impact and therefore play a key role as advocates
and stakeholders in building more-resilient societies. In
2021, UNDRR amplified the voice of youth in understanding
reducing disaster risk, with youth engagement growing
across all Regional Platforms. In the Americas and the
Caribbean, UNDRR organized the first ever Youth Forum
For Disaster Risk Reduction prior to the Regional Platform,
resulting in a Youth Declaration on DRR and participation
of 300 youth and activists from the region. In Europe
and Central Asia, youth representatives participated in
a Ministerial Round Table at the European Forum for
DRR (EFDRR), and a plenary session on Accelerating
implementation of the Sendai Framework, and were actively
involved in EFDRR virtual discussions.

STRATEGIC OBJECTIVE 3

Ms. Kristinia Doughorty speaking at the Fourth High-Level Meeting of Ministers and Authorities on the Implementation
of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030 in the Americas and the Caribbean

Next-generation innovation: youth DRR activism in
the Caribbean
Climate-change-related risks in the Americas and
the Caribbean include hazards like severe weather,
hurricanes, flooding, erosion and drought, as well
as earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. Young
people under 30 face specific vulnerabilities when
disasters hit because they often rely on others for
economic provision, access to basic services, and
resource or decision-making support. In island states,
socio-economic factors increase risk exposure and
challenge adaptive capacities to this age demographic.
In response, UNDRR increased engagement with
under-30s on disaster risk reduction, bringing together
young people to host the first online Youth Forum
for Disaster Risk Reduction in August 2021. Three
hundred of the brightest young minds across the
Americas and the Caribbean participated and shared
ideas on pressing climate-change and DRR issues in
their countries, amplifying the voices and values of
young people to help promote youth-led initiatives
across the region.

With Africa having the youngest population in the world, the
African Union helped establish the Africa Youth Advisory
Board (AYAB) for disaster risk reduction in the continent,
to close gaps in youth stakeholder engagement. In Africa,
the Board addresses meaningful youth engagement around
the continent and collaborates closely with UNDRR, relying
on advisory and technical guidance to amplify initiatives.
The AYAB uses the Sendai Framework and the Programme
of Action for the implementation of the Sendai Framework
as twin foundations to create youth-focused initiatives that
feature SDGs as prime programmatic actions. Both were
used in the design and facilitation of multiple conferences,
programmes and events — such as the Africa Regional
Platform for 2021 — where youth consultations on DRR took
place and voluntary stakeholder commitments were made.

58 | UNITED NATIONS OFFICE FOR DISASTER RISK REDUCTION

In 2021, AYAB boosted engagement and strengthened
network outputs through a collaboration with UNESCO on a
science and technology app (KNOW DRR); operationalized
UNDRR technical assistance to increase engagement in DRR
policy-making and provided support to young academics,
researchers and community leaders in Uganda.
Youth engagement also extended into flagship UNDRR
initiatives, including MCR2030, the Sendai Voluntary
Commitments Platform, Global Platform 2022 preparations
and the forthcoming Mid term Review of the Sendai
Framework 2023.

Kristinia Doughorty, a DRR expert from Jamaica, Red
Cross volunteer, and PhD candidate at the University
of the West Indies, helped organize and facilitate the
forum as she believes climate change is a disaster risk
and livelihoods issue. Her call to action is to involve
more young people in the implementation of the
Sendai Framework to help design and apply innovative,
disaster risk reduction actions, tools and preventative
counter-measures that are tailored to local realities for
youth.
“We [youth] hold the front line on climate change
and DRR interventions, sustainably moving forward
at the local level by connecting humanitarian and
development aspects so they’re more inclusive

and diverse. This means bringing vulnerable and
marginalized groups into the fold, especially indigenous
people given their long-standing knowledge in multiple
areas,” says Doughorty. Since the forum, Doughorty
and youth leaders across the region have grown their
networks to source more effective ways for promoting
disaster risk reduction and environmental resilience.
Some are in talks with local academic, government,
and private-sector stakeholders to develop new youth
platforms where leaders can help shape DRR policies
and processes. Activists also found ways to leverage
the isolation faced by millions of people across the
world as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Doughorty reflects, “The pandemic made us pivot
towards social-media activism to have greater reach.
These days, a farmer in the most remote part of
Grenada frequently uses at least one platform they like.
This matters because when a message goes viral, it
does so across apps and connects people…especially
the messages that resonate, like the negative impacts
of climate change or how to recover financially after a
disaster.”
Up next for young regional DRR changemakers is
taking ideas and recommendation from the Youth
Forum and similar conferences, including the
Caribbean Youth Environment Network, to spearhead
virtual engagements that keep conversations flowing
and action coming. With more young people in the
Caribbean fully aware that they inhabit, or are in
proximity to, spaces that increase their exposure and
vulnerability to compounded hazards, this age group
wants a seat at the table to ensure inclusivity and
diversity are central to DRR processes and in brokering
partnerships across the region to better leverage risk
and shape more-sustainable, resilient futures.

UNDRR published 28 opinion pieces and press
releases in news outlets in 2021, and the SRSG
delivered speeches at more than 23 high-level
events and meetings. Moreover, 74 DRR-related
articles were published throughout the year.
UNDRR supported increased awareness and
understanding of DRR through the implementation
of four major campaigns during 2021: #Prevention

Reduction, World Tsunami Awareness Day, and
While you were talking. Multi-media approaches
of sharing and disseminating information on the
International Day for Disaster Risk Reduction and
World Tsunami Awareness Day, as well as data
on the Sendai Framework targets, generated large
audiences and drove up online traffic. All efforts
heightened UNDRR’s global impact.
The regional office for the Americas and the
Caribbean ran seven major advocacy campaigns,
mobilizing partners and stakeholders on core

DRR initiatives. Campaigns positioned DRR in the
context of systemic risk and risk governance, and
the impact of outreach resonated with Member
States and donors such that the regional office
experienced an increased demand for public
events designed, organized and facilitated by
UNDRR, to increase engagement on disaster
risk, climate change, inequality and resilience.
A regional media network was launched at the
Regional Platform for DRR (RP21), increasing
demand for UNDRR to provide training to the
media and provide reliable and specialised inputs
for media coverage, including the BBC, on climate
change. Journalists across the region published
DRR-related activities, resulting in 38 pieces of
content created and published.
In Asia and the Pacific, UNDRR strengthened
its relationship with the largest political block in
the region, the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN), co-organizing a regional event
for donors and partners from the Pacific and
South Asia, with a call to action for improved
international cooperation on DRR. UNDRR
campaigns and events promoted the social
currency and leadership of women in COVID-19
response and recovery, as well as the need for
more gender-responsive COVID-19 plans. Based
on the outcomes of events throughout the year,
policy briefs developed provided Member States
with approaches and steps for ensuring COVID-19
recovery supports inclusivity and gender equality.

In 2021, UNDRR communications and virtual
engagement on disaster-risk approaches and
measures continued to grow, with webinars and
online events as the new norm amid the ongoing
pandemic. Concrete messages developed and
shared across digital and social media further
increased UNDRR visibility and illustrated its
added value in the provision of support in disaster
risk reduction in development and humanitarian
and conflict settings.

In 2021, the International Day for Disaster Risk
Reduction and World Tsunami Awareness Day focused
on international cooperation under the promotion
of Sendai Framework Target F. For World Tsunami

UNDRR SRSG Ms. Mami Mizutori and African Risk Capacity Group ASG Mr. Ibrahima
Cheikh Diong speaking at UN Climate Change Conference UK 2021, COP26.

Turning up the volume at
COP26
UNDRR developed a call to action for DRR inclusion
prior to COP26, rallying stakeholders and partners, new
and existing, around three key messages for shifting the
climate change and international policy landscapes:
•	

Raise ambitions for risk-informed climate change
adaptation.

•	

Enhance risk analytics and increase support for
averting, minimizing, and addressing losses and
damages

•	

Accelerate predictable and risk-informed
investments and financing.

UNDRR and its partners advocated for DRR and riskinformed development in 31 workshops, lectures, meetings
and conferences in the Arab States. Events increased
awareness and collective action on financing disaster risk
reduction for stakeholders across the region, with outcomes
resurfacing in IDDRR commemorations and special
sessions at the United Nations Hub at Expo 2020, Dubai.
In parallel, UNDRR developed a publication that analysed
progress on Target F of the Sendai Framework (international
cooperation in DRR) and included levels of financial flows,
technology transfer, and capacity development for disaster
risk reduction.
Stakeholders participating at the European Forum on DRR
used the opportunity to strengthen collective workstreams,
share responsibilities and take action towards reducing
disaster risk and adapting to climate change. In the lead up
to the EFDRR, participants amplified messages and kept
the momentum going by launching the Prevention Saves
Lives campaign to engage the Forum’s diverse membership
in increasing local disaster-prevention programming and
responses for earthquakes, floods, drought, heat waves and
other disasters that affect the lives of more than 923 million
people across the region. Reframing narratives on disaster
resilience is the first step to creating meaningful action
that spurs transformational investments in the future of the
planet.

The UNDRR regional office in Africa supported stakeholders
in increasing DRR awareness through consultations, events
and campaigns. To mark International Day for Disaster
Risk Reduction (IDDRR), the African Union Commission and
Dubai Expo held an event on disaster risk reduction and
climate resilience that featured the development of new
situation rooms in Ethiopia (African Union Commission),
Niger (African Centre of Meteorological Application for
Development) and Kenya (IGAD Climate Prediction and
Applications Centre), that supports the implementation of
the Africa Roadmap for improving use of DRR data for early
warning and transboundary disaster risk management. To
boost IDDRR advocacy, ARISE Africa collaborated with the
UNDP-OCHA Connecting Business initiative in hosting a
joint webinar for strengthening the role of the private sector
in Africa in financing disaster management projects.

UNDRR leveraged its existing partnership with the
World Broadcasting Union (WBU) and supported
several professional journalists in attending COP26,
to elevate the importance of DRR in climate action.
WBU journalists produced more than 70 video pieces,
including interviews and features. This enabled media
outlets who were not able to travel to COP26, as a result
of COVID-19 or financial restrictions, to cover DRR and
climate-action issues.

IMPROVED AWARENESS OF UNDRR’S ROLE
IN CATALYSING AND CONVENING DISASTER
RISK REDUCTION POLICY AND ACTIVITIES,
SO THAT COLLABORATION AND INVESTMENT
ARE INCREASED
Through awareness raising and campaigns on
disaster-risk governance, UNDRR cemented its
role as a strong, global convener of disaster
risk reduction policy in 2021. Extensive media
coverage of the COP26 focus on DRR in the
climate-action agenda led to heightened brand
awareness for the organization, and highlighted
the importance of integrating DRR policies with the
Sendai Framework at regional and national levels.
Collective efforts between UNDRR and the World
Broadcasting Union resulted in the distribution of
COP26 media assets to 500 broadcasters globally
through syndicated coverage. The total number
of UNDRR mentions in the media increased 50
per cent in November 2021, due to the creation of
consistent COP26 and climate-change messaging
in advance of the conference. Accelerating brand
awareness played out across all communications
media, and comprehensive organizational
messages contributed to establishing a stronger
outward-facing image of UNDRR’s vison,
leadership and expertise in disaster risk reduction.
In Asia and the Pacific, UNDRR partnered with
journalists to source and feature examples
of successful implementation of the Sendai

Framework: nature-based solutions in India
to counter climate-induced disasters; building
back better through resilient infrastructure in the
People’s Republic of China; expanding the role of
women in DRR projects in Japan, and the uptake of
community early-warning and risk communication
in Nepal. As a result, UNDRR was able to publicize
numerous success stories from across the region
to help drive up public demand for disaster risk
reduction.
In Europe and Central Asia, the European Forum
for Disaster Risk Reduction was organized as a
Member-State-driven process following a yearlong multi-stakeholder consultation process that
included more than 100 entities from the region.
In the Americas and the Caribbean, 12 media
outlets attended the Regional Platform (RP21)
and journalists drafted 24 articles on the event,
significantly increasing the Caribbean outreach
and contributing to a better understanding of DRR
and the Sendai Framework at national and regional
levels.

In line with the push to promote women’s leadership in
DRR, the regional office in Asia and the Pacific profiled 58
WIN DRR members with publications on PreventionWeb.
In addition, UNDRR collaborated with partners to share
ways of making DRR initiatives gender-responsive at the
CSW66 Expert Group Meeting, UN System-Wide Action
Plan on Gender Equality and Women’s Empowerment (UN
SWAP) annual conference, UNITAR Women’s Leadership
Programme, the Huairou Commission, and Slum Dwellers
International session at COP.

PreventionWeb is the knowledge-sharing platform
for disaster risk reduction for those working on
the frontline of disaster risk and vulnerability (44
per cent of its 180,000 users per month come
from high-risk countries). The 2021 redesign and
relaunch included an interactive friendly site that
facilitates access to knowledge. Over the year, the
platform had more than 2.16 million unique users,
a 17 per cent increase from 2020, and published
over 5,000 news, publication, event, training
and vacancy entries. Coverage of the pandemic
continued, with a dedicated track for COVID-19
stories and reports that demonstrated how
governments, cities and local communities tackled
the complex nature of the pandemic at local,
national, and global levels. Other critical areas
of coverage included: women in DRR, disabilityinclusive DRR policies, disaster displacement and
AI solutions, among others.
Across UNDRR’s corporate platform, new
systems, like the Resilient Cities Scorecard and
the MCR2030 Dashboard, were developed and
enhanced to improve the user experience and
encourage interoperability between UNDRR’s
activities. Work also began on UNDRR’s Data
Strategy and Roadmap 2022-2025 to further
streamline the organization’s work in this area.

REGIONAL CAMPAIGNS AND
WEBINARS
To increase interest and collaboration on specific
disaster-risk themes—drought, food security,
tsunamis, earthquakes and more — the Americas
and the Caribbean regional office published
eight podcast episodes in an innovative effort to
reach and involve youth. Each episode brings in
an expert to discuss an aspect of DRR (systemic
risk, COVID-19 recovery, disaster preparedness)
and publicize main areas of action by the regional
office such as MCR2030 or private-sector
engagement. Along with the podcast, the Regional
Office launched a magazine with features on
Caribbean-specific DRR and COVID-19 recovery
challenges, as well as achievements of the work
being implemented by UNDRR with partners in
the region, to drive up interest in disaster-risk
strategies and inspire action.
Side events at UNFCCC Africa Climate Week
in September 2021 progressed conversations
on comprehensive climate and disaster risk
management, innovative financing solutions for
climate risk and resilience-building, and ways of
unifying climate-risk data at country level.

EFFECTIVE LEARNING AND KNOWLEDGESHARING ACROSS THE ORGANIZATION
AND EXTERNALLY

Several DRR-related articles that contributed to UNDRR
learning and knowledge-sharing in Europe were published
on: PreventionWeb, the MCR2030 domain and the regional
Twitter account. Organizational plans, action, processes
and results were also promoted through UNDRR INFO, a
monthly newsletter of 3,500 subscribers that provides
updates on disaster risk reduction activities, campaigns and
implementation in Europe and Central Asia. The editions
included the latest news and updates of the regional office,
MCR2030 and Central Asian Initiative’s activities on disaster
risk reduction. International Day for Disaster Risk Reduction
and Prevention Saves Lives campaigns, as well other DRRrelated activities implemented by the regional office were
promoted through the newsletter.

Institutes of higher (DRR) learning in the Americas.
The UNDRR Global Education and Training Institute
(GETI) has been essential in turning theoretical ideas
on disaster risk reduction into practical applications.
Participants from the Federal University of Juiz de
Fora in Brazil applied what they learned by giving
technical support to the Juiz de Fora municipality on
developing a resilience baseline using the Disaster
Resilience Scorecard for Cities. With support from the
Regional Office, university partners modified the GETI

training course for local officials and incorporated
tools from the Making Cities Resilient 2030 initiative
— translating training materials and MCR2030
courses into Portuguese and then, in September
2021, training 43 municipal agents on operational
approaches to formulating local action plans for
disaster risk reduction and resilience.

Disaster risk reduction goes viral

REDUCING DISASTER IMPACT THROUGH
EFFECTIVE PROMOTION OF BEHAVIOURCHANGE STRATEGIES AND ACTIVITIES

To prevent disasters and minimize damages and
losses, individuals must transform how they think
about future risks and plan for them. Based on
the UNESCO Futures Literacy campaign, UNESCO,
UNDRR, UNDP and the youth-led U-INSPIRE
Alliance, launched the Future Thinking on Disaster
Risk Reduction initiative in Asia and the Pacific.
Running into 2022, the project has engaged
over 700 young professionals through a series
of webinars and thought labs, in challenging
conventional ways of thinking about disasters.
Participants and stakeholders-in-the-making
are encouraged to think of novel solutions that
are strategic, comprehensive, inclusive and
anticipatory, and that adequately allow for the
accurate assessment of catastrophic risks that
prompt forward-looking and context-relevant
solutions.
Connecting core values that bridge DRR
communities with others, helps the creation of
practical and multi-disciplinary policy solutions in
civil society, science, government, academia and
the private sector. An aspect of this bridge-building
is fostering behavioural change and applying
interventions that shift attitudes and perspectives.
Case studies in the GAR Special Report on
Drought emphasized the importance of developing
tools that onboard the “effects of adaptive or
non-adaptive human behaviour and potential
adaptation measures on future drought risk.”

UNDRR audiences increased around the world in 2021
with 30 million impressions linked to organizational
digital content. The LinkedIn page became the UNDRR
top channel with 221,270 followers, and UNDRR
advocacy engagement increased: the International

Day for Disaster Risk Reduction campaign focused
on international cooperation for DRR and the
hashtag #OnlyTogether generated over 305 million
impressions. Likewise, the World Tsunami Awareness
Day campaign had 194 million impressions.

The report was launched on the World Day to
Combat Desertification and Drought in conjunction
with the United Nations body coordinating this
work, the UN Convention for Combating Drought
(UNCCD).
The regional office in the Americas and the
Caribbean promoted behavioural change through
animated short films like The Girl and the Tsunami,
produced with UNESCO. The film follows the story
of a Chilean girl, Martina Maturana, who saved the
lives of people in her community after providing
early-warning alerts during the Robinson Crusoe
Island tsunami of 2010. This film was shown at a
regional online event in Spanish, organized jointly
with the Government of Chile and at an in-person
event in New York. The film was shown at the
global event for WTAD and featured on UNDRR
and UNESCO’s YouTube channels.

ENHANCED EFFECTIVENESS, EFFICIENCY
AND QUALITY OF OPERATIONAL
PERFORMANCE, BASED ON APPROPRIATE
GENDER-SENSITIVE INTERNAL POLICIES,
STRUCTURE AND STAFFING
2021 was a year where UNDRR focused on
long-term planning and operational stability for
strengthened organizational performance. The
continuation of the challenges posed by COVID
necessitated the review of the physical working
conditions, which resulted in the relocation of
the UNDRR Offices in September 2021. The new
premises offered more space and allowed better
social distancing as staff gradually returned to
the office in the last quarter of 2021.

Globally, it became easier to work virtually with
connectivity, service-provider costs and limited
internet-access issues addressed. In November
2021, UNDRR held a series of regional platforms
through a hybrid format — the first in a series
of major, virtual events deemed successful by
attendees and participants and a cost-effective
method for boosting connectivity to staff from
all 18 UNDRR locations.

A more robust online support service was
launched to help staff at all locations find
information on various administrative services,
the regulations and rules pertaining to the work
of the organization, and other useful resources
that would enable them to access up-to-date
information on a central site as, and when,
needed.

UNDRR COMMITMENT TO
MAINSTREAMING GENDER

74 | UNITED NATIONS OFFICE FOR DISASTER RISK REDUCTION

Moreover, the Special Representative of the Secretary
General for Disaster Risk Reduction, in her role as an
international gender champion, worked with partners and
women’s groups to share good practices on gender and
DRR, and promote the voices of women and girls at regional
platforms.

UNDRR was successful in achieving gender parity in
panels across the four regional platforms held in 2021,
ensuring that women’s voices and expertise are heard and
recognised. The Regional Platform in the Americas and
the Caribbean had an overall participation of 53 per cent
women, 46 per cent men, and 1 per cent who identified as
non-binary.
Making Cities Resilient 2030 promoted female speakers in
training and webinars on local resilience, and 45.6 per cent,
or 2,248 of 4,931 participants, who took part in GETI training
workshops were women.
By the end of 2021, 58 per cent of UNDRR staff were female.
The graph below shows gender parity by grade. The figures
in the graph represent absolute numbers of staff.

UNDRR actively incorporated gender and
disability lenses in its policies, guidelines and
tools to strengthen gender-responsive DRR
projects and offer ways of improving reporting
on, and disaggregating, sex, age, and disability
data, leveraging women’s leadership in DRR,
and increasing gender-responsive COVID-19 and
health-centred recovery responses. Within the
organization, gender equality — a central tenet
of global frameworks and agendas in the run up
to 2030 — was further mainstreamed across all
objectives of the UNDRR Strategic Framework
for 2022-2025.

Lessons learned from previous years were
incorporated into the new UNDRR Strategic
Framework for 2022-2025 and Work Programme
2022-2023, while the new robust planning
methodology allowed for staff to better integrate
inclusive approaches into projects and prioritize
resources and financing.

The UNDRR gender-parity strategy and the Action
Plan to Prevent and Respond to Sexual Exploitation and
Abuse (PSEA) were updated to respond to challenges
and opportunities presented by COVID-19. As part of its
commitments to implement the UN System-wide Action
Plan (UN-SWAP) on Gender Equality and the Empowerment
of Women (GEEW), UNDRR undertook a gender-capacity
assessment of staff and developed a plan to support
improved harmonization of gender equality and women’s
empowerment in technical counsel, knowledge products
and programmes.

In the Americas and the Caribbean, partners of the
Disability Inclusive DRR Network (Red GIRDD-LAC)
supported accessibility at regional events and saw to it that
recommendations and key messaging on DRR — including
COVID-19 response-and-recovery processes — were created
with the inputs of persons living with disabilities, their
families, and caregivers.

Disability inclusion was publicly advanced in Asia and the
Pacific through the Asia Pacific Partnership Forum for
Disaster Risk Reduction, WIN DRR Roundtable Discussions,
and side events on risk communication during ESCAP
disaster resilience week. UNDRR continually flagged the
importance of accessible and integrated disability-friendly
risk projects and communications, and succeeded in
boosting engagement on the issue with partners, such
as CREWS, to expand inclusion of disability stakeholder
groups and networks. All actions helped onboard specific
objectives for improving gender equality and disability
inclusion across the early-warning, early-action value chain.

Disability inclusion was another core intersectional
aspect championed globally and in the regions. UNDRR
called attention to and increased engagement on the
establishment of accessible disability-friendly DRR projects
and communications. The UNDRR disability inclusion
road map for 2022-2025 was drafted in 2021 and is under
consultation prior to adoption.

At the Eighth Regional Platform for Disaster Risk Reduction
in Africa, a side event organized by Christian Blind Mission
and the International Disability Alliance underscored
the importance of implementing disability-inclusive
DRR aspects in programmes. Of note, panellists from
Zimbabwe and Malawi shared country-level experiences,
which led to relevant recommendations enshrined in public
messages about mandating inclusive DRR and humanitarian
responses.

DONOR OVERVIEW

In December 2020, Member States underscored
the importance of funding UNDRR in General
Assembly Resolution 75/216, paragraph 46, which:
“Recognizes the continued importance of voluntary
funding, and urges existing and new donors to
provide sufficient funding and, where possible,
to augment financial contributions to the United
Nations trust fund for disaster reduction to support
the implementation of the Sendai Framework,
including through unearmarked and, where
possible, multi-annual contributions.”
Throughout the year, donor partners continued
to recognize the important role of UNDRR in
preventing new, and reducing existing, disaster
risk as well as managing residual risk. UNDRR
identified financial requirements of USD 96.2
million for the Work Programme 2020-2021.
Efforts to raise sustainable and predictable
financial resources to deliver the UNDRR Work
Programme resulted in USD 43.8 million in
contributions received in 2021. The overall amount
raised during the 2020-21 biennium amounted to
USD 91.6 million.

The flexible nature of unearmarked core funding is
vitally important to UNDRR. It enables the office to
focus on strategic result areas, to afford smooth
and effective operational delivery, to adjust to
changing circumstances and allow for forward
planning, as 99.9 per cent of total funding is
through extra-budgetary resources.8 Unearmarked
donors continued to support UNDRR, providing
USD 19.3 million in 2021, which represents 44 per
cent of funding received.
To increase predictability of funding in 2021,
UNDRR continued to advocate with strategic
partners for multi-year contributions. Luxembourg
and Sweden renewed commitments through new
cooperation agreements for the period 2022-2025.
As a result, USD 33.5 million was pledged for 2022
onwards by year end.
The top ten donors to UNDRR — Sweden, Japan,
Germany, the United States of America, Norway,
the European Commission, the Republic of Korea,
Italy, Australia and Switzerland — each contributed
more than USD 1 million in 2021. A special note of
appreciation was expressed to the Government of
Israel and SM Prime Holdings for contributing to
UNDRR for the first time.
In-kind contributions were another important
source of support to the work of UNDRR in the
delivery of its Work Programme in 2021. Notably
the Governments of Jamaica, the Kingdom of
Morocco, Kenya and Portugal made significant inkind contributions by hosting Regional Platforms
for Disaster Risk Reduction.

Member States and partners supported UNDRR
in its work through in-kind professional support
including 16 UN Volunteers and seven Junior
Professional Officers (JPOs) provided by the
Governments of Italy (1), Finland (1), Japan (1),
Sweden (1), Switzerland (1), and United States of
America (2) — critical human resource that enables
UNDRR to deliver its mandate.

Throughout the year, UNDRR facilitated peer-topeer exchange and knowledge sharing through
regular consultations and dialogue with UN
Member States at the UNDRR Support Group in
Geneva, the Group of Friends in New York, as well
as two donor meetings and four thematic briefings
to donors held virtually in 2021.

The Government of Sweden, UNDRR and WFP enhanced
cooperation under the Horn of Africa Partnership for
Early Warning and Early Action and developed a regional
flood-risk profile in 2021, in collaboration with the
Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) and the
IGAD Climate Prediction and Applications Centre (ICPAC).
That inter-agency cooperation resulted in strengthened
risk information services delivered to 11 Member States.
The partnership also contributed to the launch of the IGAD
Disaster Operations Center, for impact-based early-warning
and enhanced assessment of food insecurity and early
action.
In 2021, UNDRR worked with governments that held
the Presidency of the Council of the European Union,
namely Portugal and Slovenia, to promote disaster risk
reduction at the Working Party on Humanitarian Aid & Food
Aid (COHAFA) and the Working Party on Development
Cooperation (CODEV), that are attended by the EU Group of
Member States and form an important venue to inform EU
discussions.
Strategic partners also contributed to scaling up disaster
risk reduction in climate change and other policy
discussions, including in the margins of the Conference
of the Parties (COP26) and advocacy milestones in 2021.
UNDRR, with the Governments of France and the United
Kingdom, co-hosted a pre-COP26 event entitled From Risk
to Resilience: Accelerating Adaptation Action at COP26, in
collaboration with WMO and the World Resource Institute.
In reviewing COP26 adaptation goals, the event explored
how to improve preparedness for climate-related disasters
and support national adaptation planning, with the aim
of empowering and protecting those most vulnerable to
climate change.
UNDRR would like to thank all its donors, without whose
generous contribution UNDRR’s crucial work in accelerating
global efforts in disaster risk reduction to ensure a more
resilient and more sustainable future for all would not be
possible.
