Executive summary

Governments adhering to the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises (the
Guidelines)1 are required to set up a National Contact Point (NCP) to further the
implementation of the Guidelines. NCPs have two main functions: 1) to promote the
Guidelines and handle enquiries, which means that NCPs ensure that the Guidelines and
the role of the NCP are known among relevant stakeholders and across government
agencies; and 2) provide a grievance mechanism to resolve cases ("specific instances")
relating to non-observance of the Guidelines by companies. NCPs report annually to the
OECD’s Investment Committee, and this report compiles and analyses the key data
reported by NCPs regarding their activities in 2020.
The year 2020 has been a notable one for NCPs for two main reasons. First, it marked the
20th anniversary of NCPs as non-judicial grievance mechanisms. Several activities were
organised on this important milestone. The Secretariat published a report highlighting the
many strengths and achievements of NCPs in addressing corporate impacts in an
increasingly complex and globalised world, but also some enduring challenges and
weaknesses that may hinder their contribution to remedy. In this regard, the report identifies
a number of avenues for governments to strengthen their NCPs and maximise their
contribution to remedy. The Global Forum on Responsible Business Conduct was also
partly dedicated to access to remedy and NCPs as part of their 20th anniversary.
Second, NCP activity was strongly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, as office
closures, meeting restrictions and travel bans disrupted their ability to deliver on their
mandates. Like for most government services, this led to events cancellations and delayed
work. However, NCPs were progressively able to adjust and ensure that promoting the
Guidelines and handling could continue largely remotely.
In terms of specific instances, 2020 was in fact the record year in terms of cases received
(54), bringing the grand total of cases handled by NCPs since 2000 to over 575. Half of
cases submitted in 2020 were done so by individuals, whereas the share of cases submitted
by NGOs or trade unions was smaller than in previous years. NCPs also closed 38 cases in
2020, in line with previous years. Fourteen cases were not accepted and 24 were concluded,
delivering nine agreements. This means that the rate of non-accepted cases, which had been
a concern of some stakeholder groups in recent years, dropped below average levels in
2020. Importantly, the trend towards a generalisation of recommendations in final
statements has continued in 2020. NCPs have also kept following up more systematically
on cases, which allowed them to achieve new results or to evidence positive impacts in
2020. Finally, 42 NCPs now have publicly available rules of procedure, the highest
recorded number.
In terms of institutional arrangements, NCPs have continued to seek to include stakeholders
in their structures, but also to struggle with human and financial resources. Like in 2019,
the overall number of NCP officials dropped in 2020. Only 19 NCPs reported having fulltime staff and over half of them experiencing staff turnover in 2020. Shortage of staff and
excessive turnover have long been identified as one of the biggest challenges for NCPs.

In terms of promotion, 2020 was characterised by a massive shift towards online
promotional events. The number of NCPs that promoted the Guidelines remained stable in
2020, and while events organised by NCPs have dropped sharply, the number of events in
which NCPs participated remained within average levels. NCPs have also invested in
online promotional tools during 2020, as all reporting NCPs now have a website and 26 of
them renewed or improved their website in 2020. This shift towards online promotion will
present both opportunities and threats for NCPs as COVID-19 restrictions ease out, which
NCPs will have to navigate strategically.
Finally, in 2020, NCPs continued with peer learning activities with the support of the
OECD Secretariat in the framework of the Action Plan to Strengthen NCPs (2019-2021),
working in particular on tools such as an online training tool for NCPs or templates and
guidance for initial and final statements. No peer reviews were launched in 2020 due to a
lack of commitments from governments. Twenty-one governments are currently
committed to undergo a peer review of their NCP by 2023, leaving 10 governments
(including five OECD Members) yet to commit. In 2017, the MCM committed to having
all NCPs peer reviewed by 2023.

Introduction

Governments adhering (Adherents) to the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises
(the Guidelines)2 are required to set up a National Contact Point (NCP) to further the
implementation of the Guidelines.3 NCPs have two main functions: 1) to promote the
Guidelines and handle enquiries, which means that NCPs ensure that the Guidelines and
the role of the NCP are known among relevant stakeholders and across government
agencies; and 2) provide a grievance mechanism to resolve cases ("specific instances")
relating to non-observance of the Guidelines by companies.4 The Council
Recommendations relating to the due diligence guidance tools provide that NCPs should
contribute to their dissemination and active use by enterprises.5 This unique
implementation mechanism distinguishes the Guidelines from other international RBC
instruments and continues to play a critical role in ensuring that commitments under the
Guidelines are met. There were 49 NCPs in all adherent countries in 2020. In December
2020, the OECD Council invited Uruguay to adhere the Declaration on International
Investment, which includes adherence to the Guidelines [C(2020)149], Uruguay became
the 50th Adherent in February 2021.6
Handling specific instances is a core pillar of the mandate of NCPs and a key feature of
what makes the Guidelines unique.7 By end 2020, NCPs had received over 575 specific

For example, the 2018 Recommendation of the Council on the Due Diligence Guidance for
Responsible Business Conduct [OECD/LEGAL/0443] recommends “that Adherents and where
relevant their NCPs, with the support of the OECD Secretariat, ensure the widest possible
dissemination of the Guidance and its active use by enterprises, as well as promote the use of the
Guidance as a resource for stakeholders such as industry associations, trade unions, civil society
organisations, multi-stakeholder initiatives, and sector-initiatives, and regularly report to the
Investment Committee on any monitoring, dissemination and implementation activities.”

Uruguay adhered to the Guidelines on 25 February 2021. As part of its commitment to fulfil the
requirements under the Guidelines, the government has committed to establishing an NCP. As of
March 2021, all 37 OECD Member countries had adhered to the Declaration, as had 12 non-Member
countries: Argentina (22 April 1997), Brazil (14 November 1997), Costa Rica (30 September 2013),
Egypt (11 July 2007), Jordan (28 November 2013), Kazakhstan (22 June 2017), Morocco (23

instances in total.8 This mechanism has been part of the mandate of NCPs since the 2000
review of the Guidelines. 2020 therefore marked the 20th anniversary of NCPs as nonjudicial grievance mechanisms. Several activities were organised on this occasion, such as
the Global Forum on RBC, which was partly dedicated to access to remedy and the role of
NCPs in this regard, and a Secretariat report highlighting achievements and challenges in
delivering this role, and identifying avenues for policy action to strengthen NCPs.
The year 2020 was also marked by the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, which
affected businesses and their stakeholders around the world, but also the ability of NCPs to
deliver on their mandate. NCPs have shown resilience in adapting to these circumstances,
and most of them have put in place remote mechanisms to continue promoting the
Guidelines and handle cases.
This report outlines the main activities of NCPs in relation to their mandate, and generally
the main developments around NCPs. This report is based essentially on annual reports by
NCPs to the OECD Secretariat, and on the OECD database of specific instances.
Section 2 provides an overview of the report on the 20th anniversary of NCPs as non-judicial
grievance mechanisms. Section 3 presents the key statistics of specific instances closed and
received in 2020 and discusses trends emerging from the numbers. Section 4 presents
information on NCP structures and activities, with a focus on promotion and peer-learning,
and discusses trends emerging from developments in the past year. Annexes contain an
overview of the data reported by NCPs in relation to their institutional arrangements and
activities.

Currently 500 cases are listed on the public OECD specific instance database. The remaining
specific instances have not yet been reported to the OECD for inclusion in the database as they were
still in progress or recently closed.

1. 20 years of NCPs as non-judicial grievance mechanisms

The year 2020 marked the 20th anniversary of the mandate of
NCPs to act as grievance mechanisms under the Guidelines. On
this occasion, the Secretariat published a report entitled ‘National
Contact Points for Responsible Business Conduct – Providing
access to remedy: 20 years and the road ahead.’ The report was
informed by extensive consultations with NCPs themselves,
delegates to the OECD Working Party on Responsible Business
Conduct, stakeholders, academics and RBC experts. It was
launched during a public event on 14 December 2020. The report
also includes an annex highlighting 20 recent and notable cases
handled by NCPs, each time analysing their distinct contribution
to remedy.9
The report notes that, in the last 20 years, globalised corporate activity had intensified and
related developments, such as climate change and global inequalities had accelerated,
making RBC and access to remedy more relevant than ever. In that context, the report
examines NCP practice over that period and concluded that, as remedy mechanisms, NCPs
have been a widely available remedy platform, as cases can be filed with little formalities,
at relatively limited cost and without the need of legal help. Numerous types of submitters,
from trade unions and civil society organisations, to indigenous communities, individuals
and businesses, have used the NCP mechanism. The report also evidences that NCPs have
actively facilitated concrete remedies for the persons affected, including through financial
or in-kind compensation or changes in companies’ policies and operations. The outcomes
of cases handled by NCP have also contributed to shape processes for the development of
government policies, and to promote stronger policy coherence for RBC.
The report then analyses challenges that have hampered NCPs’ ability to contribute to
remedy. These challenges include lack of visibility and accessibility, but also difficulties
in handling and managing cases efficiently. As a result, the resolution of many cases has
been delayed or has not led to a positive outcome. Another important challenge is ensuring
that parties can engage fairly and safely in the process, particularly in light of reports that
in some cases, submitters face undue pressure.
The report concludes that these challenges reflect weaknesses that not only affect the
operations of individual NCPs, but also their design as a grievance mechanism. In light of
this, NCPs’ important achievements are all the more remarkable. However, to keep pace
with today’s challenges and to respond to the increased calls for responsible business
conduct, it is critical that adhering governments continue to strengthen their NCPs, and
address their operational and structural weaknesses. The report identifies several
possibilities to do so. At individual NCP level, possible actions by governments include
increasing human and financial resources allocated to NCPs and ensuring that NCP
structures are fit for purpose. At the level of the network, possible actions include
improving coordination of practices and procedures and better monitoring of NCP
effectiveness.

2. Specific instances

2.1. Overview of specific instances handled in 2020
In 2020, NCPs closed 38 specific instances and received 54 new specific instances. This is
the highest figure for cases received over a single year, the second being 2018 (50). ‘Closed
specific instances’ refers both to concluded cases and those that are not accepted for further
examination (see Box 2.1). The sections below give an overview of the outcomes of closed
specific instances and trends identified for the new ones.
Box 2.1. Terminology for the status of specific instances

Specific instances closed during the year include both specific instances that have been
concluded during the year and those that were not accepted during the year.


Specific instances concluded during the year are those that the NCP found to
merit further examination after the initial assessment and that have subsequently
been closed. For such specific instances the NCP will have offered its “good
offices” (e.g. mediation/conciliation) to both parties.



Specific instances not accepted during the year are those that the NCP found
not to merit further examination, or cases that have been withdrawn prior to the
completion of the initial assessment and that have therefore been closed.



Specific instances that are in progress are those that are not yet closed. These
include submissions received by the NCP and under consideration, as well as
those accepted by the NCP.

2.1.1. Key outcomes of specific instances
Among the 38 specific instances that were closed in 2020, 29 were already in progress as
of 1 January 2020 and nine were submitted during the year. Of the specific instances in
progress at the end of 2020, 34 were submitted prior to 2019. Table 2.1 provides an
overview of closed specific instances in 2020. Out of the 38 specific instances closed in
2020, 24 were concluded and 14 were not accepted.
Of the 24 concluded specific instances, 13 underwent mediation (54%). In six concluded
specific instances mediation was offered but did not take place as one or both parties
declined to participate, and in five no mediation was offered by the NCP. In two cases,
mediation was not offered because an agreement was reached by the parties during the
initial assessment phase, and in three cases, no mediation was offered because the NCP
reconsidered the link between the company and the issues after initial assessment.
Six concluded cases resulted in full or partial agreement between the parties within the
NCP process and three resulted in full or partial agreement between the parties outside of
the NCP process. Agreement between the parties was therefore reached in 38% of all
concluded cases (Figure 2.1) and 54% of all cases where mediation occurred, compared to
86% in 2019 and 36% in 2018.

IUF & AB-InBev: On 2 April 2019, the International Union of Food, Agricultural, Hotel,
Restaurant, Catering, Tobacco and Allied Worker’s Associations (IUF) representing the
local union in India (HBLMU), submitted a specific instance to the Belgian NCP, alleging
that AB InBev, a Belgian-Brazilian brewing company, had not observed the OECD
Guidelines by interfering in trade unions activities, refusing to recognize the HBLMU
president as a union representative and engaging into anti-union practices that led to
suspensions of unionists and workers. Mediation set up by the Belgian NCP and conducted
by a professional mediator initially did not lead to an agreement but the parties resumed
their dialogue focusing on the central issue of the dismissal of four employees. The NCP
continued to support the process by overseeing a conciliation session lasting several days
between the parties. This led to an agreement whereby the company notably provided the
workers with a direct remedy by committing to reintegrate the dismissed workers and
recognise their role of trade union representatives. The workers representatives, for their
part, agreed to cease their protests and local actions.
Teck-Quebrada Blanca Mining Company and Mineworkers Union: On 29 November
2017, the Mineworkers Union n°1 of the Teck-Quebrada Blanca Mining company
submitted a specific instance to the Chilean NCP alleging that the company Teck-Quebrada
Blanca did not observe the OECD Guidelines during a 2017 collective bargaining
agreement due to environmental non-compliance in the company’s operations. The issues
particularly concerned equal opportunities for the workers, non-discrimination processes,
transparency and health and safety in the workplace. The company refuted the claim but
nonetheless engaged constructively in the mediation procedure overseen by the NCP,
which eventually resulted in an agreement structured in ten points. As part of the
agreement, the company notably committed to improve communication with workers in a
transparent manner and to hold meetings with trade unions and the human resources
department on a monthly basis. The company further agreed to strengthen mechanisms for
reporting harassment in the workplace. It also includes follow-up actions by the NCP.

2.1.2. Type of companies involved in specific instances
All 29 specific instances closed in 2020 and for which the size of the company is known
involved large enterprises (defined as companies employing over 250 employees).10 Final
statements do not contain sufficient information about the companies involved to determine
their size in six specific instances, while in three other specific instances, non-corporate
parties were involved (a government-based export credit agency and two trade unions).
Publicly listed entities were involved in 18 (46%) closed specific instances, while privately
held companies were involved in nine (23%). Two companies involved in specific
instances were state-owned (5%). Information on the ownership of six companies involved
in specific instances is unavailable (see Figure 2.2).
Fortune Global 500 companies were involved in eight specific instances (28% of known
companies, compared to 47% in 2019).11 The known headquarter locations of companies
involved in specific instances cover 16 countries (Table 2.1).

2.1.3. Final statements
The Procedural Guidance of the Guidelines provides that NCPs will "at the conclusion of
the [specific instance] procedures and after consultation with the parties involved, make
the results of procedures publicly available […]"12. In particular, the Commentary on the
Implementation Procedures of the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises
provides that when the NCP "decides that the issues raised in the specific instance do not
merit further consideration, it will make a statement publicly available after consultations
with the parties involved”13 and “if the parties fail to reach agreement or if the NCP finds
that one or more of the parties to the specific instance is unwilling to engage or to participate
in good faith the NCP will make recommendations as appropriate in the public
statement.”14 Determinations (to indicate that a company has or has not observed the
recommendations of the Guidelines) can also be made by NCPs.
Statements constitute an important tool to support the effectiveness of the Guidelines and
enhance transparency, accountability and visibility of NCPs. Substantiated decisions,
recommendations and determinations by the NCP can help companies and stakeholders
better understand the Guidelines and what steps, actions, policy measures they can take to
fully observe them. Some NCPs have also shared that, in certain contexts, the prospect of
the NCP issuing a determination could be a disincentive for companies to engage with the
NCP.
At the time of writing, final statements had been published for 34 of the 38 (89%) specific
instances that were closed in 2020. This is a decrease compared to 2019, when final
statements had been published for 97% of closed cases.
Seventeen of the 21 final statements published for concluded cases include
recommendations (81%), representing an increase over 2019, when only 67% of final
statements contained recommendations.15 Recommendations were primarily issued in

cases where parties have not been able to engage or reach agreement (14). Examples of
recommendations are available in Box 2.3.
Box 2.3. Examples of recommendations in NCP final statements

Imperial Metals Corporation and SEACC: On 23 December 2016, the Southeast
Alaska Conservation Council (SEACC) submitted a specific instance to the Canadian
NCP alleging that Imperials Metals Corporation had failed to disclose and conduct
human rights and environmental due diligence with respect to the impacts of their
mining operations on Alaskan ecosystems and fisheries. The mediation organised by the
Canadian NCP did not result in an agreement, prompting the NCP to make several
specific recommendations, including to put in place a stakeholder consultation strategy
drawing upon the OECD Due Diligence for Meaningful Stakeholder Engagement in the
Extractive Sector that identifies communities potentially affected by its activities and
ensures those communities are adequately consulted and informed.
Adidas and Südwind: On 19 March 2018, NGOs Südwind Institute, Sedane Labour
Resource Centre and Clean Clothes Campaign, submitted a specific instance to the
German NCP alleging that Adidas had failed to adequately use its leverage in relation
to alleged anti-union behaviour, layoffs, and wage matters at a subcontractor factory in
Indonesia. The mediation organised by the German NCP did result in a mutually
accepted understanding regarding the wage issue, but not the right to work and freedom
of association issue, prompting the NCP to recommend that the company reviews its
reporting and complaint channels in this context and that the submitters contribute to
this. More specifically, the NCP encouraged the company to assess possible obstacles
for whistle-blowers to come forward.
EDF / EDF Renewables and Prodesc / Union Hidalgo Agrarian and Indigenous
Sub-Community: On 12 February 2018, a group of NGOs based in Mexico submitted
a specific instance in relation to plans for a windfarm project by EDF Energies
Nouvelles, a subsidiary of EDF in charge of renewable energy, located in an area of
Mexico where agrarian as well as indigenous communities are present. The specific
instance raises issues related to respect of local law, due diligence, human rights and
disclosure with regard to indigenous people rights. The submitters withdrew their
participation during the mediation phase, prompting the NCP to make three specific
recommendations to the companies:


Adapt their policy of engagement with stakeholders, in particular with regard to
indigenous peoples and communities potentially affected by its different
projects, and with regard to social and cultural interests, by reference to the
OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Business Conduct



Establish an RBC committee composed of external stakeholders and the
designate a person responsible to manage relations with these external
stakeholders.



When projects raise land-tenure issues linked with indigenous peoples, consult
with various stakeholders, including in relation to the project at hand.

instance to the Dutch NCP concerning the links of Shell Petroleum Development
Company of Nigeria Limited (SPDC), a subsidiary of Royal Dutch Shell (RDS), with
the impacts of a gas fire eruption in 1998 on farmland and the environment. OCC had
initially been advised to use SPDC’s operational-level grievance mechanism (OLGM),
but no agreement could be reached. This led the Dutch NCP to offer its good offices,
which the company declined. The NCP then proceeded to examine the case, and
determined that SPDC had “failed to demonstrate that its grievance mechanism
functions in a manner that can be considered to be consistent with the OECD Guidelines
and the UNGPs.” As a result, the NCP recommended that SPDC provide more
transparency regarding its grievance mechanism, and that RDS use its leverage to ensure
that SPDC develop its grievance mechanism in a way that complies with the OECD
Guidelines and UNGPs.

2.1.4. Follow-up
Following up on recommendations in final statements can be a valuable exercise in
ensuring agreements reached through specific instance proceedings are implemented and
in tracking whether recommendations are being implemented. Follow up was identified as
good practice by NCPs in a ‘Guide for NCPs on follow up to specific instances’, published
in 2020.17
In 2020, the final statements in 14 of the 24 concluded cases (58%) included plans to follow
up on the outcomes of the case (agreement and/or recommendations), representing a
decrease over 2019 (67%). Additionally, in 2020, the NCPs of Australia, Brazil, Chile,
France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland and Switzerland issued follow-up
statements relating to 13 specific instances. For several cases, follow up allowed to achieve
new positive results or to evidence the concrete impacts of the outcomes secured as a result
of the NCP’s intervention (see Box 2.5).

Determinations were issued by the NCPs of the Netherlands and Finland.

Box 2.5. Examples of positive developments evidenced by follow-up

ANZ Banking Group, and Inclusive Development International and Equitable
Cambodia: In June 2018, in the absence of an agreement following mediation in this
specific instance, the Australian NCP had made recommendations to ANZ Banking
Group in relation to its provision of a loan for a sugar plantation and refinery project in
Cambodia, which was alleged to have forcibly displaced the families and dispossessed
them of their land and productive resources. Civil society actors on the ground continued
to raise the issue of compensation and provided essential support to the NCP to facilitate
this during the follow up phase. As a result, during the follow up conducted by the NCP
in 2020, the parties engaged constructively again and reached an agreement whereby
the bank recognised the continuing hardships faced by the affected communities, and
agreed to pay them profit it earned from the loan. This is the first example of an NCP
case leading to compensation by a bank towards harms associated with the activities of
one of its clients.
Grupa OLX and Frank Bold Foundation: In 2019, the Polish NCP had fostered an
agreement whereby Grupa OLX, an internet service company, committed to remove
from its online sales platform advertisements for environmentally harmful products. The
follow up conducted by the Polish NCP in 2020 showed that the company had removed
16,629 advertisements for furnaces advertised to burn processed oil a harmful product.
In the case of 6,656 additional advertisements, the company had informed its users that
their content did not comply with their advertising expectations, and advertisements that
were not subsequently corrected were removed by the company.

2.1.5. Specific instances not accepted for further examination
As noted above, 14 specific instances (37%) closed in 2020 were not accepted for further
examination. This represents the second consecutive yearly decrease in the non-acceptance
rate (in 2019, this rate had decreased from 50% to 46%), which is now below the average
non-acceptance rate since 2000 (39%).
The main reason for not accepting specific instances in 2020 was that the NCP considered
that it was not the correct entity to handle the case. This reason was raised in 5 specific
instances (36%). The identity of the parties was also an issue in a number of cases, as three
specific instances involved entities that were not considered as covered by the Guidelines
(Figure 2.3).

Box 2.6. Cases involving entities not covered by the Guidelines

UK Export Finance (UKEF) and Global Witness: On 16 March 2020, the NGO
Global Witness submitted a specific instance to the UK NCP alleging that the UK’s
export credit agency, UKEF, had not observed the Guidelines by failing to support the
2015 Paris Agreement climate objectives. The UK NCP did not accept the case, as it
considered that UKEF was not an entity covered by the Guidelines, as it does not strictly
engage in commercial activity but provides financial products that are not otherwise
available on the private market, and does not have a corporate legal personality, but
rather exists as a government department.
(K)SBSI & ITUC and ACV: On 6 and 8 May 2020, an individual, declaring to act as
the chair of an Indonesian trade union called (K)SBSI, submitted two specific instances
to the Belgian NCP alleging that the International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC),
on the one hand and Algemeen Christelijk Vakverbond - Confédération des syndicats
chrétiens (ACV-CSC), a Belgian trade union, on the other hand, had not observed the
Guidelines in relation to issues of copyright infringement and a dispute about the
ownership of (K)SBSI. The Belgian NCP did not accept the case as it considered that
these trade unions did not have any commercial purpose or activity, and therefore did
not fall under the scope of the Guidelines.

2.1.6. Duration of procedures
The Commentary to the Procedural Guidance provides an indicative timeframe of three
months for completing the initial assessment.18 Of the specific instances closed in 2020 for
which the date of the initial assessment is known, the statement was published within three
months in only six cases (16%). In 16 specific instances (42%) the initial assessment took
between 3-6 months. In seven specific instances (18%) it exceeded one year.

18

Para. 40.

2020 ANNUAL REPORT ON NATIONAL CONTACT POINTS FOR RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS CONDUCT

-----------------------Page 17 End-----------------------

18 
The Commentary to the Procedural Guidance provides that “as a general principle, NCPs
should strive to conclude the procedure within 12 months from receipt of the specific
instance. It is recognised that this timeframe may need to be extended if circumstances
warrant it, such as when the issues arise in a non-adhering country.”19 In 2020, only two
specific instances were concluded within a year (13%). In 21 specific instances (91%),
proceedings lasted for over a year, and in 12 of these cases (31 %) they lasted more than
two years.
The timely handling of cases was flagged as a challenge for NCPs in the Report on the 20th
anniversary of NCPs. Causes identified were the complexity of cases and the availabilities
of the parties, but also issues internal to NCPs such as a lack of human resources or lengthy
coordination processes when several NCPs are involved in cases. In 2020, whereas the
average duration of initial assessment phases is consistent with previous years, the average
duration of the good offices and conclusion phases has significantly increased. One of the
explanatory factors for these additional delays may be the COVID-19 pandemic (see
Box 2.7).
Box 2.7. Impacts of the COVID-19 crisis on the handling of specific instances

As noted in the Report on the 20th anniversary of NCPs (see section 1), the COVID-19
crisis stretched NCPs’ resources and their ability to conduct promotion and handle cases
in a timely manner. As a result, many NCPs had to inform current and future parties that
their cases would be delayed. Due to lack of resources, some NCPs were forced to close
temporarily while others reported a decrease in human and financial resources.
Most NCPs were however able to adjust progressively to the situation and continue to
deliver their mandate while working remotely. NCPs notably had to rethink the
modalities for holding mediation sessions to take account of the global travel bans and
meeting restrictions while still addressing issues on a global scale (a strength of NCPs
highlighted by the Report on the 20th anniversary of NCPs). An example of this approach
can be found in the case International Union of Food, Agricultural, Hotel,
Restaurant, Catering, Tobacco and Allied Worker’s Associations (IUF) & ABInBev, in which the Belgian NCP and its professional mediator organised several online
mediation sessions. This required to amend the terms of reference of the mediation, in
particular as regards guarantees of confidentiality, but also to adopt new strategies to
maximise the involvement of the numerous participants in an online environment.

2.2. Trends of new specific instances
A total of 54 new specific instances were submitted to NCPs in 2020 compared to 37 in
2019. This represents an increase in submissions based on historical rates since 2000,
making 2020 the year with the highest number of new cases(see Figure 2.4.).

At the end of 2020, the status of the 54 specific instances submitted that year was the
following: 44 were in progress, 9 have not been accepted for further examination, and one
was concluded as the parties had reached an agreement outside the NCP process during the
initial assessment phase (see Figure 2.5).

22 
Figure 2.5. Status of specific instances submitted in 2020

The Commentary to the Procedural Guidance provides that the NCP of the host country
should consult with the NCP of the home country in its efforts to assist the parties in
resolving the issues.20 It also provides that when issues arise from an enterprise’s activity
that takes place in several Adherent countries or from the activity of a group of enterprises
organised as a consortium, joint venture or similar form, based in different Adherent
countries, the lead NCP should consult with other NCPs.21 19 specific instances submitted
in 2020 (35%) are or were handled with the help of supporting NCPs.

2.2.1. Specific instances by industry sectors
The most prevalent sectors referenced in specific instances submitted in 2020 were mining
and quarrying (24% with 13 submissions), electricity and gas (15% with eight
submissions), financial and insurance activities (13% with seven submissions), and
accommodation and food services (11% with six submissions), followed by, manufacturing
(9% with five cases), and construction, agriculture, forestry and fishing, and other service
activities (8% with four submissions each). The high rate of submissions from the
extractives and financial sectors reflect recent trends (See Figure 2.6.)

Box 2.8. Issues related to the mining sector: the example of tailings dams in Brazil

Impacts resulting from tailings dam collapses are a recurring issue in the mining sector.
The Brazilian NCP has sought to provide access to remedy to those affected by these
impacts in several cases. In 2019, in the case of Vale and BHP Billiton and SITICOP,
CNQ-CUT, BWI, and IndustriALL in which the submitters claimed compensation
for the families of the victims of the November 2015 Fundão dam collapse, the Brazilian
NCP had made several recommendations to the companies, focused on the need to carry
out and increase resources for due diligence in relation to tailings dams.
In 2020, two more cases linked to the Brumadinho dam collapse of January 2019, Vale
S.A., and Mr. Carlos Cleber Guimarães Júnior and Ms. Carla de Laci França
Guimarães and Vale S.A. and Multiple Individuals, focusing on the economic
repercussions of the catastrophe on local populations. The Brazilian NCP accepted both
cases for further examination in April 2020.

Figure 2.6. Specific instances submitted in 2020 by industry sector

2.2.2. Chapters of the Guidelines cited in specific instances
The chapters on Human Rights and General Policies (which includes recommendations on
due diligence) were the most frequently referenced chapters, with respectively 39 (72%)
and 31 (57%) of the specific instances submitted, followed by the chapters on Environment,
and on Disclosure. The Human Rights chapter has been the chapter most often referenced
in specific instances since its introduction in the 2011 update of the Guidelines (see
Figure 2.7).

As highlighted in the Secretariat’s policy note on COVID-19 and responsible business
conduct,22 the COVID-19 crisis has the potential to create or exacerbate the entire range of
issues covered by the Guidelines. Workers were identified in the note as particularly at risk,
whether in companies’ own operations or throughout supply chains. As a result, an RBC
approach to crisis management is required of companies, not only to mitigate these impacts,
but also to build resilience and enhance recovery and future preparedness. Remedy
mechanisms will be crucial to ensure that this is the case. In 2020 one case explicitly
addressing COVID-19-related issues in the workplace was submitted (see Box 2.9).
Box 2.9. Case addressing COVID-19-related issues in the workplace

Teleperformance and UNI Global Union: On 17 April 2020, UNI Global Union, an
international labour union together with four of its French affiliates, submitted a specific
instance to the French NCP alleging that Teleperformance did not observe the
Guidelines in ten countries where it operates call-centres. The submitters pointed to
impacts related workers’ rights to health and safety at the workplace, freedom of
association, collective bargaining, and to failures to conduct appropriate due diligence,
in the context of COVID-19 pandemic. On 3 July 2020, the French NCP, in coordination
with seven other NCPs, accepted the case and offered its good offices to the parties, who
accepted. In its statement, the French NCP notes the importance and urgency of the
issues related to the prevention and management of COVID-19.

3. NCP structures and activities

3.1. Structures and locations
As established by the Decision on the Guidelines, while Adherent governments have
flexibility in how to structure their NCP, they are under an obligation to make available
human and financial resources to their National Contact Points so that they can effectively
fulfil their responsibilities.23 Key among these responsibilities is:


seeking the active support of social partners;



dealing with the broad range of issues covered by the Guidelines;



operating in an impartial manner; and



developing and maintaining relations with stakeholders.24

Governments are also expected to ensure that their NCP can operate in accordance with the
core criteria of visibility, accessibility, transparency and accountability.25 When handling
specific instances, NCPs should also observe the principles of impartiality, predictability,
equitability and compatibility with the Guidelines.26

3.1.1. Overview of NCP structures
In 2020, NCPs reported being set up according to the following types of structure:27


Single agency NCP: The NCP is composed of one individual in a single ministry,
or by a group of individuals belonging to the same service in the same ministry.
o In 2020, there were 19 single agency NCPs: Argentina, Austria, Chile,
Colombia, Estonia, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Luxembourg,
Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Poland, Turkey, Ukraine, the United Kingdom,
and the United States.



Inter-agency NCP: The NCP is composed of a group of representatives from
several ministries or government agencies.
o In 2020, there were 12 inter-agency NCPs: Brazil, Canada, Costa Rica,
Germany, Hungary, Japan, Morocco, Portugal, Romania, Slovenia, Spain, and
Switzerland.

maps how Governments have set up their NCPs and how the mechanisms operate and make
decisions in relation to their mandates.

-----------------------Page 26 End-----------------------

 27


Multipartite NCP: The NCP is composed of a group of government officials and
stakeholder representatives.
o In 2020, there were ten multipartite NCPs. Five were tripartite, i.e. they include
representatives of government, business and trade unions (Belgium, France,
Latvia, Sweden and Tunisia). Five were quadripartite, including representatives
of civil society organisations (Croatia, Czech Republic, Finland, Kazakhstan
and the Slovak Republic).



Expert-based NCPs: The NCP is composed of experts who are appointed by, but
external to, the government. These NCPs are generally set up as entities
independent of the government, although they are dependent upon the government
for funding. Experts may be required to act in a personal capacity and not to
represent particular interests or on the contrary may represent the views of the
organisations that nominated them.
o In 2020, there were four expert-based NCPs: Norway, Denmark, Lithuania and
the Netherlands.

In addition, the NCPs of Australia and Korea were set up under a hybrid structure composed
of elements derived from different models above, namely single-agency and expert-based
(Australia), or inter-agency and expert-based (Korea). No data is available for Egypt and
Jordan.
In 2020, the Croatia NCP reported for the first time, as the newest member of the NCP
Network. An overview of the Croatian NCP’s structure is in Box 3.1.

External Body.
The Secretariat of the National Contact Point is responsible for coordinating all
activities of the National Contact Point, providing administrative support to the work of
the External Body, drawing up an annual report on the activities of the National Contact
Point to be submitted to the OECD Investment Committee and participating in annual
meetings of the OECD Working Group on Responsible Business. The Secretariat of the
National Contact Point is made up of one official of the Ministry of Foreign and
European Affairs and one official of the Ministry of Economy and Sustainable
Development.
The External Body consists of one representative from:


Ministry of Foreign and European Affairs



Ministry of Economy and Sustainable Development



Ministry of Labour, Pension System, Family and Social Policy



Croatian Chamber of Economy



Croatian Employers’ Association



Each Adherent can also decide on the location of its NCP, bearing in mind the core criteria
for functional equivalence. This location is either that of the NCP itself (for single-agency
NCPs) or, for NCPs that are set up as committees meeting intermittently (inter-agency,
multipartite, expert-based), the location of their permanent office or Secretariat handling
the daily management of NCP affairs (receiving inquiries and specific instances, organising
or participating to promotional events, preparing NCP decisions, etc.). In 2020, no NCPs
reported a change in their location or structure (Figure 3.1):


Thirty-three NCPs were located in Ministries with an economic portfolio (i.e.
Ministries of Economy, Trade, Industry, Investment, Business, etc.);



Ten NCPs were located in Ministries of Foreign Affairs; and



Three NCPs were located in Investment Promotion Agencies.

In addition, the Secretariat of the NCP of Korea is located in a private entity, the Korea
Commercial Arbitration Board. No data is available for Egypt and Jordan.
The location of NCPs was identified in the Report on the 20th anniversary of NCPs as an
important factor conditioning the perception of impartiality of NCPs by stakeholders. The
report notably points out the need for governments to clearly provide for measures to avoid
that personal or organisational links between the NCP and its members on the one hand,
and other potentially conflicting portfolios or interests on the other hand, lead to a perceived
lack of impartiality.28

3.1.2. Rules of procedure for the handling of specific instances
Having clear rules of procedure is an important way to ensure a predictable process to
resolve cases and to build trust among stakeholders. NCPs have made important progress
28

See p. 38.

2020 ANNUAL REPORT ON NATIONAL CONTACT POINTS FOR RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS CONDUCT

-----------------------Page 29 End-----------------------

30 
in this regard over the years. In 2020, 42 NCPs had rules of procedure available online,
compared to 39 in 2019, with Kazakhstan, New Zealand and Portugal making their rules
of procedure available online in 2019. Moreover, nine NCPs modified their rules of
procedure (Argentina, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Finland, Greece, Japan, Morocco and
Portugal). Amongst the different updates to the rules, NCPs noted issues such as initial
assessment, follow up, impartiality and preventing conflicts of interest. These updates
support ongoing efforts by many NCPs to ensure a more consistent approach to casehandling across the NCP network, a challenge that was highlighted by the Report on the
20th anniversary of NCPs.

3.1.3. Reporting
As part of the core criteria for functional equivalence, NCPs are required to be accountable.
Under the Procedural Guidance, NCPs must report annually to the OECD Investment
Committee29 and may communicate on a regular basis to Government and/or Parliament.
Such reporting can be an important means to raise the internal profile of NCPs within their
Governments and to ensure that budgetary challenges that the NCPs may face can be
addressed. In 2020:



Thirty-three NCPs reported on their activities to their Government, and 13 reported
to Parliament.30
All except two NCPs (Jordan and Egypt) reported on their activities in 2020 to the
OECD. This was also the case for Jordan in 2019.

3.1.4. Meeting attendance
NCPs are required to meet regularly to share experience, in particular by attending the two
annual meetings of the NCP Network at the OECD.31
As noted above, the COVID-19 pandemic affected NCPs by reducing human and financial
resources, but also by limiting their ability to travel to meetings. In recognition of the
situation, both NCP meetings of 2020 were organised fully virtually. In 2020, a total of 45
NCPs attended the meeting of the NCP Network in June and 42 attended in November.
Four NCP (Egypt, Jordan, the Slovak Republic and Slovenia) did not attend either of the
two NCP meetings in 2020, compared to one in 2019 (Jordan).

3.1.5. Stakeholders as part of the institutional arrangements
Stakeholders can be formally integrated into the institutional arrangements of the NCP, for
example as members of the NCP or on the NCPs’ advisory or oversight bodies. Including
key stakeholders – such as workers’ organisations, civil society organisations and the
business community – as part of the NCP’s institutional arrangement can serve to enhance
the expertise available to the NCP and may render it easier to maintain relations with
stakeholders, to seek their support, and ultimately to gain and retain their confidence.
To promote impartiality of the NCPs, the Commentary to the Procedural Guidance
recommends that NCPs establish multi-stakeholder advisory and/or oversight bodies.32

 31
While these do not normally form part of the NCP and do not have decision-making power
on accepting or concluding specific instances, they can provide important advice to the
NCP on a range of issues, including general strategy of the NCP, promotional plan,
stakeholder engagement, general guidance on handling specific instances (e.g. advice on
rules of procedure, updates on cases received and concluded, etc.).
In 2020, 22 NCPs had an advisory body (compared to 21 in 2019, Croatia having been
added to this number). During 2020, some NCPs, such as Greece, also started the process
of setting up an Advisory Body, which will be finalised in 2021. This continues to show
that NCPs are increasingly including stakeholders in their structure, and thereby creating
opportunities for strengthening engagement and building confidence with stakeholders.
Five of these advisory bodies also provided oversight to the NCP (Australia, Austria, Chile,
Switzerland and the United Kingdom).33

3.1.6. NCP resources
As established by the Decision on the Guidelines, adhering Governments must ensure that
their NCP has the human and financial resources to effectively promote the Guidelines and
handle the broad range of specific instances that it may receive. In June 2017, the OECD
Ministerial Council Statement, entitled “Making globalisation work: better lives for all”
committed to “having fully functioning and adequately resourced National Contact
Points”.34 In 2019, the Ministerial Council discussed a Progress Report on National Contact
Points for Responsible Business Conduct that presented key facts and figures, as well as
recommendations, in relation to that commitment. In 2020, the Report on the 20th
anniversary of NCPs also identified appropriate human resources, in terms of numbers,
expertise and seniority, as a key factor for the effectiveness of NCPs.35
In 2020:


Eleven NCPs reported having both full-time and part-time staff (compared to 17 in
2019)



Eight NCPs reported having full-time staff only (compared to seven in 2019)



Twenty-five NCPs reporting having part-time staff only (compared to 21 in 2019)36

Taken together, in 2020 the share of absolute staff resources throughout the network
decreased (166 in 2019 to 146 in 2020). Furthermore, frequent turnover of staff continues
to present a challenge to NCPs in terms of ensuring institutional memory and handling
ongoing specific instances. In 2020, 51% of NCPs reported staff changes (in 2019, 55%
reported staff changes)37. In particular, in 2020:


21 NCPs reported that a total of 41 new staff members had joined

Note: the data is based on count for 47 NCPs for both 2020 and 2019. For 2020, the count includes
Croatia (reporting for the first time) but not Egypt or Jordan. For 2019, the count includes Egypt but
not Croatia or Jordan.

2020 ANNUAL REPORT ON NATIONAL CONTACT POINTS FOR RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS CONDUCT

-----------------------Page 31 End-----------------------

32 


22 NCPs reported that a total of 43 staff members had left

With regards financial resources:


Twenty NCPs had access to a dedicated budget for their activities.



Six NCPs reported that the financial resources available to them were not sufficient
to conduct promotional activities (as compared to 11 NCPs in 2019; this could in
part be explained due to the lower costs of promotion given the shift to online events
to adjust to the conditions of the COVID-19 pandemic).



Four NCPs reported that resources available were not sufficient to handle cases in
a timely and effective manner (compared to one in 2019). Among those NCPs, three
did have open cases in 2020.



Forty-seven NCPs noted that funds were available to them for attending NCP
meetings at the OECD.

As noted in the Report on the 20th anniversary of NCPs (see above, section 1), as well as
the Progress Report on National Contact Points for Responsible Business Conduct
delivered to the OECD Ministerial Council in 2019, insufficient human and financial
resources continues to be a major concern for NCPs.38 The lack of full-time staff, and the
fact that many NCP officials have other duties and only devote a portion of their time to
NCP work, was highlighted in the reports as an issue. Even though working on other RBCrelevant issues alongside NCP duties may be beneficial in terms of policy coherence, this
may also limit the official’s ability to actively promote the Guidelines and the NCP, or to
handle cases in a timely and efficient manner as mandated by the Guidelines, particularly
as case complexity is only set to increase. This also comes at a time when NCPs report
facing increasing demands from various sources as the RBC agenda develops across
government and society. Responding to these developments with equivalent or diminishing
levels of staff also challenges the ability of NCPs to deliver on their more regular activities,
such as promotion and the handling of specific instances. As a result, both reports
recommended that governments ensure that NCPs have the necessary financial and human
resources to carry out their mandates, particularly in light of the heightened complexity of
their work.39

3.2. Promotion of the Guidelines
Ensuring that NCPs are visible requires sustained efforts to raise awareness among the
business community, worker organisations, civil society organisations and other interested
parties. An important function of NCPs is to promote awareness of the OECD Guidelines
and the due diligence guidance that offers tools to the private sector on how to do business
responsibly. In line with this function, over 2020, many NCPs met with stakeholders across
government, business, trade unions and civil society to promote the OECD Guidelines and
due diligence guidance.

 33
Moreover, to facilitate the broad uptake of the guidance, several NCPs over the course of
2020 translated the Guidelines and due diligence guidance into other languages:


The Portuguese NCP launched the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible
Business Conduct in Portuguese;40



The German NCP launched the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible
Supply Chains in the Garment & Footwear Sector41 and the Due Diligence for
Responsible Corporate Lending and Securities Underwriting in German.42

NCPs also organised or participated in online events to discuss RBC’s role in addressing
the impact of COVID-19 (see Box 3.2).
Box 3.2. Discussing the role of RBC in addressing the impact of COVID-19: examples of
events organised or participated in by NCPs

The COVID-19 pandemic has created major disruptions in the economy and the life of
businesses, whether or not they are able to continue their operations. As noted in the
Secretariat’s policy note on COVID-19 and RBC (see above), an RBC approach to the
COVID-19 crisis response can help ensure that the environmental, social and other
governance issues set down in internationally-recognised RBC standards are central in
the design and implementation of both government and business responses.
To support both governments and companies in understanding how RBC standards can
be leveraged to inform the response to COVID-19, NCPs across the network have been
active in a number of events. For example:


The Danish Responsible Business Authority presented on the OECD
Guidelines, sector due diligence guidance for the garment and footwear sector
in the context of the COVID-19 crisis during Wear Denmark’s “12 Weeks of
Sustainability” programme.



The French NCP shared the Government of France’s emergency package to
address COVID-19, which includes RBC components, during the OECD Global
Forum on RBC.



The Costa Rican NCP participated in a webinar hosted by the UN Working
Group on Business and Human Rights, which looked at RBC, human rights and
the impact of COVID-19.

In 2020, 33 NCPs organised or co-organised 120 events, a 40% drop from 2019, where 35
NCPs organised or co-organised 201 events. This also means that 14 NCPs did not organise
or co-organise any promotional events in 2020, compared to 12 in 2019.43 This decrease
can be expected given the current situation with COVID-19 (see Figure 3.2 below for
evolution since 2015).

Over the course of 2020, NCPs have had to adjust their promotional strategies and pursue
remote options. While some ‘in-person’ events were held, such as conferences, meetings
with government officials or stakeholders, the majority of events took place online, and
included online training and lectures, webinars, and conference calls. Topics covered
remained broad, ranging from overview of the NCP and its’ functions, updates on new laws
or initiatives, to due diligence and responsible supply chains across different economic
sectors. In 2020, 24 NCPs (50% of NCPs) hosted an annual meeting with stakeholders,
similar to 2019 (2 NCPs less than 2019).
In addition to organising or co-organising events, 36 NCPs reported taking part in a total
of 227 events organised by others, during which they participated in presentations, panels
and discussions. This is relatively stable compared to 2019, when 37 NCPs participated to
262 events, but still significantly less than the 405 events in which NCPs participated in
2017. A total of 11 NCPs did not participate in any promotional event, compared to 8 in
2019. No data is available for Egypt and Jordan.
Seven NCPs did not organise, co-organise, nor participate in any promotional event
(Greece, Iceland, Japan, Portugal, the Slovak Republic, Spain and Turkey), compared to
five in 2019 (including already Iceland and the Slovak Republic). No data is available for
Egypt and Jordan.

Box 3.3. NCP engagement with indigenous communities

On February 11, 2020, the Canadian NCP held a meeting with representatives from the
National Aboriginal Trust Officers Association (NATOA) at its headquarters in Ottawa.
NATOA explained their role as a charity organisation whose mandate is to strengthen
Indigenous communities and their ability to meet their own member needs and desires
through financial opportunities utilising trust funds and investing principles that are
consistent with Indigenous cultural traditions and values generally and those of
individual communities specifically.
The NCP explained what the OECD Guidelines are, shared with NATOA its role in
promoting the Guidelines, its work as a non-judicial grievance mechanism, its
interdepartmental organisational structure and experience of the broader NCP network
working with Indigenous communities internationally. NATOA has since been added
to the NCP’s stakeholder roster.
This event was part of the Canadian NCP’s efforts to increase stakeholder engagement,
especially among Indigenous groups and communities potentially marginalised and
vulnerable to the impacts caused by multinational corporations operating on or near their
traditional territories both in Canada and abroad. This meeting was a welcome
opportunity to promote the Guidelines and to build a relationship with NATOA and
engage in information exchange.
Almost half of reported NCP events had an audience size of 10 to 50 participants (45%),
followed by events with 50 to 100 participants (22%) or less than 10 participants (20%).
Fourteen percent of events (i.e. a total of 57 events) had an audience of more than 100
(Figure 3.5). This continues the trend represented last year of a significant increase of reach
impact compared to previous years (for example, in 2018 when, out of a comparable
number of events, 40% had an audience of less than 10, 37% of 10 to 50, 14% of 50 to 100
and 9% of more than 100). This year’s increase in average audience size should however
be analysed in the light of the massive shift towards online promotional events as a result
of the COVID-19 pandemic. Online events arguably allow to reach larger and more diverse
audiences at a lower cost, but may also limit engagement or create screen fatigue. As travel
and meeting restrictions will ease out, it will be useful for NCPs to think strategically about
the right balance between in-person and virtual events to maximise both reach and impact.

from the previous year (27 NCPs reported having a promotional plan) but still far short
from 2018 when 38 NCPs reported having a promotional plan.
In addition to promotional events, several NCPs also participate in advisory groups

3.2.1. Accessibility of information – NCP websites
Although there is no specific requirement for NCPs to have a website, an important aspect
of being visible is online presence through a dedicated website where rules of procedures
and regular updates about NCP activities and specific instance outcomes are made public.
For many stakeholders, NCP websites have served as a principal point of contact for
submitting specific instances.


All 47 reporting NCPs have dedicated websites or dedicated webpages on the
Ministry’s website that provide information about the Guidelines and the NCP,
including contact information for reaching the mechanism.44

The Commentary to the Procedural Guidance provides that “NCPs will engage in joint peer
learning activities.”45 Peer learning takes place in a variety of forms. NCPs typically engage
in peer learning at the June and November meetings of the network of NCPs (this year,
hosted online due to COVID-19 restrictions), or during peer learning events hosted by one
or several NCPs. NCPs also conduct peer learning on a regional level through regional
networks of NCPs (Box 3.4).

Box 3.4. Regional NCP networks: spotlight on the network of Latin-American NCPs

With the support of the OECD Secretariat through the project on Responsible Business
Conduct in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC), the regional network of LAC
NCPs, comprising the NCPs of Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Mexico
and Peru, met five times in 2020 to discuss themes of joint interest, with the input of
external experts, such as:


RBC and public procurement (March). During the
meeting, the NCPs shared their experiences and
challenges on public procurement and RBC and the
OECD presented its ongoing project on RBC and public
procurement. A representative of Paraguay's procurement
agency and of the NCP of Denmark, as well as OECD
experts in public procurement were invited to share their
views and experiences on the issue. Drawing on these
discussions, the OECD produced a resource document on
leveraging Responsible Business Conduct through Public
Procurement



Possibilities for collaboration with National Human Rights Institutions
(September, joint meeting with NHRIs from the LAC region, co-organised with
the Danish Institute of Human Rights and GANHRI). During the meeting, the
NHRI and NCP of Chile presented their collaboration through a Memorandum
of Understanding, focusing on promotion and access to remedy. Subsequently,
other NHRIs and NCPs shared their own experiences of collaboration and
discuss the need and potential for collaboration, as well as possible practical
arrangements. Finally, following the questions presented by the Secretariat, the
participants also shared ideas and expectations regarding possible joint actions
and activities in the future. As background to this activity, the Secretariat and
the Danish Institute of Human Rights published a Factsheet on National Human
Rights Institutions and OECD Guidelines for MNEs46 to help NCPs and NHRIs
identify synergies and opportunities for promoting business respect and support
for human rights in line with OECD and UN guidance.

In 2020, four NCPs reported having hosted a peer learning event, while 11 reported
participating in one (Box 3.5).

Webinar on COVID-19 and RBC
On 21 April 2020, the Secretariat and the Chair of the WPRBC organised a webinar for
WPRBC Delegates on COVID-19 and RBC, focusing in particular on the inclusion of
RBC components in governments’ plans to tackle the crisis, with a focus on the role of
NCPs in fostering policy coherence in that context.
Responsible Business Conduct Budapest Conference
The Hungarian NCP organised a conference on RBC in Budapest, Hungary on 27
January 2020 at the Ministry of Finance. The conference focused on the OECD
Guidelines and RBC, and brought together NCPs, government officials, business
representatives, NGOs, trade unions, academia, and the general public. Over 100
participants took part.

3.2.3. NCP participation in UN Fora on Business and Human Rights
The ninth annual UN Annual Forum on Business and Human Rights took place virtually
on 16-18 November 2020. Under the theme "Preventing business-related human rights
abuses: The key to a sustainable future for people and planet", the Forum agenda reinforced
the message “that strengthening prevention– by learning from both good practices and from
when things have gone wrong, as well as by addressing systemic gaps – can help to build
a sustainable future for people and the planet”.47 Representatives from several NCPs
attended the event and participated in panels. For example, the Polish NCP made an
intervention in the sub-session “The devastating impact of COVID-19 and related social
and economic crisis, including on decent working conditions and social protection systems
in the region” as part of the broader session “Business and Human Rights in Central and
Eastern Europe: Rebuilding trust for a new social contract”.48 Similarly, the Brazilian NCP
was a speaker in the session “Regional trends and dialogue: Latin America and the
Caribbean”, with remarks focused on OECD Guidelines (in particular, the chapter on
human rights) promotion and the Brazilian NCP role on policy coherence.
Additionally, NCPs from the LAC region participated to the 5th UN LAC Regional Forum
on Business and Human Rights from 7 to 11 September 2020 on the theme ‘RBC in difficult
times: converting challenges into opportunities.’ The Forum was held virtually and
attended by over 4400 participants.49 The Chilean NCP intervened in a panel entitled ‘All
roads lead to remedy: regional perspectives and challenges.’ Subsequently, representatives
of the Argentinian, Brazilian, Chilean, Colombian, Costa Rican, Mexica and Peruvian
NCPs held a follow up session offering a space for dialogue and exchange between LAC

3.3. NCPs at the Global Forum on Responsible Business Conduct
Part II of the 2020 Global Forum on Responsible Business Conduct, held virtually on 17
June 2020, was dedicated to Access to Remedy to address business-related impacts and
was an opportunity to mark the 20th anniversary of the National Contact Points (NCP). 50
Sessions included:

50



The landscape of remedy and dispute resolution: where are the gaps and what are
the opportunities. This opening panel explored some of the leading dispute
resolution mechanisms, and discussed how the remedy landscape can be further
strengthened.



In conversation with leading grievance mechanisms. This session addressed key
themes in addressing remedy, dialogue and accountability. It offered an opportunity
to find common threads across different grievance mechanisms and understand
lessons learnt from a wide variety of case handling approaches. The panel also
discussed what the coming years will hold for these mechanisms.



Considering access to remedy from a company perspective. This session focussed
on lessons learned from company representatives on building and running effective
operational level grievance mechanisms and participating in remediation
procedures. It offered an opportunity to address what works and what does not in
the context of remediation mechanisms. Company representatives shared concrete
experiences of handling grievances or participating in remediation processes and
the keys factors for success.



How do we define effectiveness and measure success of grievance mechanisms?
This session explored the notion of effective grievance mechanisms and ways to
meet and manage expectations regarding remedy from the point of view of the
submitter and of the company. Questions addressed related to measurement (what
are benchmarks for success in various grievance mechanisms?), methodology
(what are the tools to monitor such mechanisms?) and outcomes (what does a good
outcome look like?).



What next for access to remedy and the National Contact Points for RBC? The
closing panel built on discussions in earlier panels to reflect on how to continue
strengthening access to remedy in the years to come, and in particular, the system
of National Contact Points (NCPs) for RBC, as it enters into its third decade of
existence. It addressed issues such as the relationship between remedy and
mandatory due diligence, how are expectations of users of grievance mechanisms
likely to change in the coming years, and cooperation between different
mechanisms.



Side session: Partnering to enhance access to remedy – lessons from Asia. This
session explored how multi-stakeholder engagement can help enhance access to
remedy, drawing from practical experiences from Asia. Panellists shared
approaches that have worked for establishing and running effective mechanisms for
grievances and provide access to remedy, as well as common features of effective
mechanisms.

3.4. Action Plan to strengthen NCPs (2019-2021)
After the completion of the first Action Plan to strengthen NCPs (2016-2018), a second
Action Plan (2019-2021) was adopted in December 2018. In the continuity of the first
Action Plan, it contains four overarching priority areas: peer reviews and capacity-building,
building functional equivalence, building and improving tools, and promoting policy
coherence.
Subject to availability of funding, the Action Plan seeks to deliver additional peer support
to NCPs facing challenges meeting the core criteria, sharing of expertise and skills among
the NCPs, capacity-building among peers through regional and thematic NCP networks,
Secretariat support to NCPs to assess and address capacity-building needs among key
stakeholders, developing websites and other support tools, and supporting the mechanisms
to identify and engage with national-level opportunities to provide their expertise to
developments on RBC.

3.4.1. Tools and capacity building
The Secretariat’s practice of developing reports jointly with NCPs will continue under the
second Action Plan. In 2020, the Secretariat prepared and discussed with NCPs a technical
report on how to apply the notion of ‘multinational enterprise’ under the Guidelines when
performing initial assessment. The Secretariat also prepared and discussed with NCPs
templates and associated guidance for the drafting of initial assessment and final
statements, aimed at providing a frame of reference and bring more consistency into the
network on the format and content of these public documents.
Additionally, the Secretariat prepared several presentations on issues of interest to NCPs
such as conducting mediation remotely, building and retaining the confidence of social
partners and stakeholders, drawing inspiration from the OECD Due Diligence Guidance
for Meaningful Stakeholder Engagement in the Extractive Sector, and how NCPs can
project impartiality and avoid conflicts of interests.
In 2020, the Secretariat undertook a feasibility study and introduced a development plan
for an online training tool for NCPs, designed to serve as an on-boarding tool for new NCP
officials and as a repository of information to help NCPs in their daily work. The Secretariat
made the necessary arrangements for building the online platform on which the tool will
be hosted. The development and launch of the tool will take place in 2021, subject to
funding.
In addition, the Secretariat has been facilitating peer learning, including meetings of
regional networks of NCPs (see above Box 3.5) and training sessions on various technical
subjects.
Finally, the Secretariat has been providing tailor-made capacity-building to NCPs from the
LAC region in the context of the project on Responsible Supply Chains in Asia. In 2020,
the Secretariat developed capacity building roadmaps of activities for the period 2021-2022
with the NCPs of Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Mexico and Peru.51

3.4.2. NCP peer reviews
NCP Peer reviews offer an important opportunity to appreciate and share the internal
workings of an NCP and any barriers the NCP may face in realising its objectives, as well
as achievements and good practices in discharging its functions. The peer reviews also
include an examination of the NCP’s procedures and approach to handling of specific
instances which can help improve consistency going forward. Recognising their
importance, in 2017 the MCM committed to having all NCPs peer reviewed by 2023.52
Of the 49 NCPs, 16 have been peer reviewed. In addition, the NCPs of two Adherents
underwent significant reviews as part of the process of the countries’ accession to the
OECD. An additional 21 Adherents have committed to a peer review of their NCP by 2023
(Table 3.2). This leaves a total of 10 Adherents, of which five are OECD members, not
having yet committed to a peer review (Table 3.3).
Peer reviews are funded by the government of the NCP under review. The amount of the
contribution is as established in the Action Plan to Strengthen National Contact Points for
Responsible Business Conduct (2019-2021) and in the Revised Core Template for
voluntary peer reviews of NCPs. For some governments, providing funding has been an
obstacle to committing to a peer review or to delivering on their commitment, as noted in
the Progress Report on NCPs discussed by the OECD Ministerial Council in 2019.
In 2020, the peer review of the NCP of Korea was ongoing but no new peer reviews were
launched due to a lack of commitments by governments. Resources necessary to conduct a
peer review are often named by NCPs as an obstacle to committing to a peer review.
In November 2020, the NCPs of Argentina and the United Kingdom reported on the
implementation of peer review recommendations.

Conclusion
The past year has been a notable one for NCPs for two main reasons. First, it marked the
20th anniversary of NCPs as non-judicial grievance mechanisms. Several activities were
organised on this important milestone. The Secretariat published a report highlighting the
many strengths and achievements of NCPs in addressing corporate impacts in an
increasingly complex and globalised world, but also some enduring challenges and
weaknesses that may hinder their contribution to remedy. In this regard, the report identifies
a number of avenues for governments to strengthen their NCPs and maximise their
contribution to remedy. The Global Forum on Responsible Business Conduct was also
partly dedicated to access to remedy and NCPs as part of their 20th anniversary.
Second, NCP activity was strongly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, as office
closures, meeting restrictions and travel bans disrupted their ability to deliver on their
mandates. Like for most government services, this led to events cancellations and delayed
work. However, NCPs were progressively able to adjust and ensure that promoting the
Guidelines and handling could continue largely remotely.
In terms of specific instances, 2020 was in fact the record year in terms of cases received
(54). Almost half of these cases were submitted by individuals, whereas the share of cases
submitted by NGOs or trade unions was smaller than in previous years. NCPs also closed
38 cases in 2020, in line with previous years. Fourteen cases were not accepted and 24 were
concluded, delivering nine agreements. This means that the rate of non-accepted cases,
which had been a concern of some stakeholder groups in recent years, dropped below
average levels in 2020. Importantly, the trend towards a generalisation of recommendations
in final statements has continued in 2020. NCPs have also kept following up more
systematically on cases, which allowed to achieve new results or to evidence positive
impacts in 2020. Finally, 42 NCPs now have publicly available rules of procedure, the
highest recorded number.
In terms of institutional arrangements, NCPs have continued to seek to include stakeholders
in their structures, but also to struggle with human and financial resources. Like in 2019,
the overall number of NCP officials dropped in 2020, from 166 to 146. Only 19 NCPs
reported having full-time staff and over half of them experiencing staff turnover in 2020.
Shortage of staff and excessive turnover have long been identified as one of the biggest
challenges for NCPs.
In terms of promotion, 2020 was characterised by a massive shift towards online
promotional events. The number of NCPs that promoted the Guidelines remained stable in
2020, and while events organised by NCPs have dropped sharply, the number of events in
which NCPs participated remained within average levels. NCPs have also invested in
online promotional tools during 2020, as all reporting NCPs now have a website and 26 of
them renewed or improved their website in 2020. This shift towards online promotion will
present both opportunities and threats for NCPs as COVID-19 restrictions ease out, which
NCPs will have to navigate strategically.

Finally, in 2020, NCPs continued with peer learning activities with the support of the
OECD Secretariat in the framework of the Action Plan to Strengthen NCPs (2019-2021),
working in particular on tools such as an online training tool for NCPs or templates and
guidance for initial and final statements. No peer reviews were launched in 2020 due to a
lack of commitments from governments. Twenty-one governments are currently
committed to undergo a peer review of their NCP by 2023, leaving 10 governments
(including six OECD members) yet to commit.
