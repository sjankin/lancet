message

once again proved capable of navigating a challenging

investment in 378 projects – equalling the record amount
invested in 2015.
Highlights of the year included a large number of operations
in countries at earlier stages of the transition process,
a 33 per cent share of Annual Bank Investment in support

     The Bank’s reserves increased to €9.2 billion at the end
of 2016 (2015: €8.4 billion), reflecting both the net profit
for the year and net income allocations. The EBRD’s capital
strength is illustrated by the level of members’ equity, which
represented 27.4 per cent of total assets at 31 December
2016 (2015: 26.5 per cent), including Treasury assets with
an average risk rating between AA and AA- and an average
maturity of 1.3 years, unchanged from 2015. Members’
equity represented 56.3 per cent of Banking assets
(‘development-related exposure’) at 31 December 2016
(2015: 55.8 per cent).
     The EBRD maintained its triple-A rating, reaffirmed by
all three major rating agencies in 2016.
     The geopolitical uncertainty in the EBRD region is likely
to continue contributing to volatility in the Bank’s earnings,
particularly in the valuations of its equity portfolio and the
level of provisioning against its loan book.

authorities approved Naftogaz’s plan to unbundle the firm.
     Some financial sectors remained rather vulnerable
and fragile. High levels of non-performing loans – a legacy
of various crises during the past decade – held back
credit growth and confidence in many countries. However,
developments in the private equity and capital markets were
mostly positive. The SEE Link platform for stock markets in
south-eastern Europe was launched in the past year, linking
stock exchanges in Bulgaria, Croatia, FYR Macedonia, Serbia
and Slovenia.
     With regard to the business environment and reforms in
the corporate sector, progress was mixed. Egypt restricted
imports and rationed access to foreign exchange for some
time, although the devaluation of the national currency in
November and the signing of a new arrangement with the
International Monetary Fund should restore macroeconomic
stability and promote growth and employment. In the ICT
field, the Slovak Republic was upgraded as the completion
of Slovak Telekom’s privatisation in 2015 had addressed one
of the key remaining challenges to transition in this sector.

Green financing
The EBRD is a world leader in the provision of credit lines for
investment in sustainable energy and resource and climate
resilience projects. In 2016, projects under the Green
Economy Transition (GET) approach accounted for 17 per cent
of signings in the financial sector. The Bank financed water
efficiency and waste minimisation investments in the
Kyrgyz Republic and Turkey, which were new areas for Bank
financial-sector ventures, and continued to increase its level
of energy-efficiency and renewable-energy commitments.
    In Poland, the Bank provided a €50 million loan to Bank
Zachodni WBK under a framework aimed at financing
investment in the energy and resource efficiency of residential
buildings. A loan worth US$ 2 million (€1.9 million) to
ACBA-Credit Agricole’s leasing subsidiary in Armenia will
support SMEs wishing to reduce their energy costs by
investing in more energy-efficient equipment. The EBRD also
provided sustainable energy and resource credit lines in
Belarus, Bulgaria, Egypt, Georgia, Kosovo, Morocco, Mongolia,
the Slovak Republic and Tajikistan.

     The Bank works with public officials and other

in this area concentrated on Serbia. On the project side,
the EBRD invested TRY 30 million (€8 million equivalent) in

finance the expansion of its operations in Turkey.

Capital markets and local currency financing
To assist in diversifying the funding base of financial
institutions and encourage lending to businesses, the EBRD
supports bond issues and securitisation projects. In 2016,
the Bank participated in SME securitisations originated by
the National Bank of Greece and Alpha Bank, also in Greece.

support the growth of Tunisia’s olive oil exports.
     The EBRD engages extensively with donors and in
2016 launched technical assistance and agribusiness
advisory programmes on topics including export promotion,
corporate governance, the development of cooperatives,
alliances with universities and direct advisory support for
agribusiness firms. Much of this work focused on creating
strong value chains linking producers to processors,
retailers and ultimately consumers, as well as on raising
the quality standards of food. The Bank’s Advice for
Agribusiness programme continued to provide targeted
international advice to agribusiness SMEs in underserved
markets in the ETCs, SEMED and Ukraine.
     Under its Private Sector for Food Security Initiative, the
Bank collaborated with the Food and Agriculture Organization
(FAO) of the United Nations to facilitate dialogue between
producers and governments in the grain sector in Egypt,
the meat and dairy sectors in Serbia, and the meat sector
in Ukraine. The EBRD and FAO also worked on raising skill
levels in the dairy and grain industries in Kazakhstan and
in the olive oil sector in Morocco and Tunisia; local sourcing
of fruit and vegetable production in Moldova and Tajikistan;
and supporting innovation in the dairy industry in Armenia,
Georgia and Ukraine. The EBRD and FAO assisted Serbia
with the launch of its first voluntary food-labelling scheme for
meat products to enhance the sales potential of locally made,
premium goods.

Equity
In order to help compensate for the lack of equity financing
in EBRD countries of operations, the Bank makes direct
and indirect equity investments in companies that
are private, listed or about to be listed. These projects
contribute to the development of local capital markets
and provide reassurance to foreign investors who may be
unfamiliar with this region.
    Continued economic instability and market volatility in
countries where the EBRD invests required a revamped
approach to equity and highlighted the importance of
attracting new equity capital to the region. Accordingly,
in 2016 the EBRD strengthened its processes of equity
pipeline and portfolio management. It also mobilised
financing from global institutional investors through the
Bank’s Equity Participation Fund (EPF). Last year, the
Fund secured a total of €350 million from China’s State

Administration of Foreign Exchange and the State Oil Fund
of the Republic of Azerbaijan in its inaugural round of
fundraising. The EPF enables investors to access a diversified
portfolio of direct equity investments in the EBRD region.
    Direct equity investments by the EBRD in 2016 totalled
€506 million for 21 projects across a wide variety of sectors.
Since 1992, the Bank has invested over €12 billion in
more than 650 direct equity investments across the
region. At the end of 2016, its direct equity exposure was
€4.6 billion in 210 investments. The Bank takes only minority
positions and during the year these ranged in value from
€500,000 to €80 million. Notable projects included the
purchase of a stake in one of the largest banks in Turkey
and a co-investment alongside private equity funds in Allegro
Group, owner of the largest online marketplace in Poland.
    The Bank signed four investments under the EBRD’s
Venture Capital Investment Programme (VCIP): one new
project and follow-on funding for three existing investee
companies. VCIP transactions supply the financing that
innovative companies need in order to grow and to attract
capital from strong strategic investors.
    Significant exits included the sale of stakes in Moldova’s
leading cable and TV operator Sun Communications to
Orange Moldova and in Sompo Japan Sigorta in Turkey.
These highlighted the EBRD’s role as a bridge for companies
entering the region. Moreover, they created strong
demonstration effects for local businesses through the
introduction of best practices in corporate governance and
the successful pursuit of market expansion despite the
challenging business environment.
    Indirect equity investments by the Bank involve
participation in private equity and venture capital funds.
These operations mobilise institutional investors’ capital
alongside that of the EBRD and offer beneficiary companies
transformative equity finance, which is often lacking in the
region. With its deep, regional knowledge and ability to
combine finance with policy dialogue, the EBRD is a strong
partner for private equity and venture capital firms in its
countries of operations.
    In 2016, the EBRD committed €219.5 million to seven
private equity funds (compared with €223 million for nine
funds in 2015). Investments included a €100 million
participation in Meridiam Infrastructure Europe III, an
infrastructure fund that will invest in greenfield projects
in the EBRD region such as hospitals and motorways.
The Bank also invested in SME-focused funds in Egypt,
Greece and Poland, as well as a venture capital fund that
specialises in early-stage technology companies in Egypt.
    In addition, the EBRD signed an agreement with
INVEGA, the Lithuanian guarantee agency, under which the
Bank will cooperate with INVEGA on the implementation
of SME-targeted risk capital funds that benefit from EU
structural funding.
    Since 1993, the Bank has invested in over 175 funds
and by mid-2016 more than 1,400 investee companies
had benefited from EBRD indirect equity financing.

logistics and intermodal networks. The Bank also promotes
transport projects that foster the use of energy efficient
technology and assist countries in adapting to climate
change. Road safety is a priority for EBRD policy dialogue
related to transport ventures.
     In 2016, the Bank signed 23 projects in the transport
sector for a total EBRD investment of €1.05 billion
(matching 2015’s investment volume). Non-sovereign
projects accounted for 44 per cent of Bank ventures
in transport by value. Projects under the GET approach
accounted for €160 million of the EBRD’s investment
in this sector, bringing to a total of €1.9 billion the Bank’s
commitment to energy efficiency and mitigation projects
in transport since 2009.
     Investments in road infrastructure were particularly
important in 2016. The EBRD extended a €200 million loan
to Croatia’s motorways agency to support the financial and
operational restructuring of the national highways sector.
The project, which benefits from consultancy services
funded by donors under the IPPF, will improve the financial
sustainability of the agency. In the Slovak Republic, the
Bank provided €148.4 million in debt financing for the
construction of new sections of the D4 and R7 motorways
under a PPP contract (see case study on page 27).
     Two loans worth a combined total of US$ 189 million
(€179 million equivalent) will help Kazakhstan’s national
road operator upgrade a stretch of road linking the capital,
Astana, to Almaty. In their first joint project, the EBRD and the
Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) each committed
US$ 27.5 million (€26 million equivalent) for the rehabilitation
of a key section of the motorway connecting the capital of
Tajikistan, Dushanbe, to neighbouring Uzbekistan.
     The EBRD invested in its first climate resilience project in
the road sector by providing a €65 million sovereign loan to
Bosnia and Herzegovina for road repairs and upgrades that
will strengthen the road network’s flood resilience. Moreover,
a €76 million loan will bolster the development of the

Finance
In 2016, the EBRD extended €1.4 billion in direct and
indirect finance to small firms in 180 projects, accounting
for 15 per cent of Annual Bank Investment and 48 per cent
of projects. It provided debt, equity and mezzanine finance
as well as other forms of risk capital. Loans in local currency
represented 28 per cent of debt transactions in the SME
sector. There were seven signings with partner financial
institutions under the Risk Sharing Facility, which reduces
the risk taken by partner financial institutions in providing
funding for, or guaranteeing, a portion of their loans to
local enterprises.
    A new US$ 500 million (€473 million equivalent) SME
Local Currency Programme, available for 21 countries,
combines EBRD capital, donor resources and policy
dialogue. It provides financial institutions and SMEs with
access to affordable funding in local currency, while also
supporting reforms for capital market development. The
Bank signed 24 local currency operations in 2016 for the
equivalent of €42 million under the Programme, which
expands an earlier initiative that was limited to the ETCs.

Advice
The EBRD provides advice for SMEs through local
consultants and international advisers on numerous topics,
including business strategy, export promotion, financial
management and reporting, marketing, brand development
and quality management. In 2016, the Bank carried out
over 2,200 projects connecting small and medium-sized
firms to local consultants, and 177 projects linking
medium-sized companies with international advisers.
From 2014 to 2016, 74 per cent of businesses surveyed
saw increased turnover in the year following their
engagement with EBRD advisory projects. Furthermore,
51 per cent expanded their business, 25 per cent
accessed external finance, for a total of €1.12 million,
and 24,512 jobs were created.
    In order to develop local consultancy markets in the
26 countries where it provides advisory services, the
EBRD organises training for local experts, conferences,
workshops and other activities. In total, the Bank ran
60 courses for over 750 consultants in 2016. A conference
on competitive consulting, held in Tbilisi, Georgia, was
one of the key events of the year.

    With EBRD technical assistance, new covered-bond
laws came into effect in Poland and Romania. These will
facilitate the growth of the covered bond markets and open
new sources of financing to banks and local governments.
The EBRD was also active in policy dialogue that resulted in
municipal bonds being accepted as collateral for repurchase
order operations with the Central Bank of Romania. With
Bank support, Armenia passed a package of laws regulating
the financial markets and amendments to the law on the
securities market to provide validity and enforceability in
derivatives transactions.
    A major outcome of the Initiative’s policy dialogue work
and technical assistance in 2016 was the launch of an
order-routing trading platform, SEE Link, which facilitates
cross-border trading between stock exchanges in south-
eastern Europe (SEE). The platform links domestic stock
markets in Bulgaria, Croatia, FYR Macedonia, Serbia and
Slovenia that have a combined equity market capitalisation
of US$ 38.5 billion (€36.5 billion equivalent) and over
500 securities eligible for trading.

Gender equality
Increasing women’s economic empowerment and equality
of opportunity is a core element of EBRD efforts to make the
countries and clients it supports more inclusive. Economies
thrive when women and men participate equally in the
workplace and enjoy the same freedom to use financial
and other services. Fostering gender equality contributes
to sound and sustainable businesses and is critical to the
advancement of transition, as recognised by the Strategy
for the Promotion of Gender Equality 2016-2020 and the
Bank’s revised concept of transition.
     The Strategy focuses on three areas: access to finance,
access to employment and skills, and access to services.
Through its Women in Business programmes, the EBRD
addresses structural barriers to economic empowerment
by making it easier for women entrepreneurs to obtain
financing and know-how. Equal-opportunity programmes
and other tailored interventions aid EBRD clients to unleash
the full potential of the women they employ and to enhance
recruitment processes. These corporate commitments
boost business performance, improve customer focus and
raise the quality of decision-making. Bank investments
in infrastructure help to ensure that transport and municipal
services are accessible and safe for all users.
     In 2016, the first year of implementation of the Strategy,
the EBRD signed 29 investments with a gender focus
or component, including credit lines under the Women
in Business programmes in Armenia, Belarus, Egypt,
FYR Macedonia, Georgia, Kosovo, Kazakhstan (see case
study on page 11) and Turkey.                                        Greener, more inclusive public transport

Legal transition
The Legal Transition Programme (LTP) helps to create
an investor-friendly, transparent and predictable legal
environment in countries where the Bank invests. It
contributes to international standard-setting initiatives;
assesses laws and practice; and aids governments to design
and implement legal, regulatory and institutional reforms.
    Major areas of focus include encouraging access to
finance, in particular for SMEs; strengthening corporate
governance; promoting resource efficiency and renewable
energy; supporting the development of the ICT sector;
supporting debt resolution and restructuring; strengthening
the performance of commercial courts and fostering
alternative methods of dispute resolution; promoting
public-private partnerships in public infrastructure
projects; and strengthening public procurement.

     In 2016, partnerships with donors were more important
     than ever in fostering sustainable market economies.
     Cooperation with fellow multilateral development banks,
     other external partners and civil society was also central
     to the success of Bank activities. Work with donors to

Reforming the management
of donor funds
Recognising the growing role that donors play in supporting
its objectives, the EBRD is committed to being a selective
and strategic user of grants; a modern development partner
to its donors, operating in line with best international
practice and with a firm focus on countries; and an efficient
manager of grant activities. Consistent with this vision, in
2016, the Bank launched a new, integrated IT system for
donor fund management and updated its donor fee policy.
The Bank also improved management of the SSF to align
the Fund more closely with the EBRD’s strategic priorities
and thus maximise efficiency.

Corporate
leadership
Launched during 2016, the Operational Effectiveness and
Efficiency programme aims to increase the impact of the
EBRD in its countries of operations by improving the Bank’s
internal processes. There is also a fresh focus on ensuring
the financial sustainability of the organisation.
    Work to extend the Bank’s success after its first 25 years
yielded tangible results. A revised concept of transition
was approved by the Board in November following work
involving Sergei Guriev, who in 2016 became the EBRD
Chief Economist. The transition concept identifies the six
desirable qualities of a well-functioning, sustainable market
economy: competitive, well-governed, green, inclusive,
resilient and integrated (see page 10).
    The updated concept has far-reaching consequences
for the way in which the Bank devises strategies and
assesses, monitors and reports on operations. The
Strategy Implementation Plan 2017-19, agreed in 2016,
includes a significant restructuring of the Bank’s corporate
scorecard so that transition impact will be reported in
terms of the six aforementioned qualities.
    EBRD Governors voted to elect Sir Suma Chakrabarti
as President of the Bank for a second four-year term. In
addition, the EBRD restructured its top-level management,
bringing together the Banking and Policy Vice Presidencies
within a First Vice Presidency, Client Services; creating
a Finance and Operations Vice Presidency, composed
of the Finance Department and the Human Resources
and Corporate Services Vice Presidency; and forming
a Vice Presidency that groups together the Bank’s Risk,

Integrity and
accountability
The mission of the Office of the Chief Compliance Officer
(OCCO) is to protect the integrity and reputation of the EBRD,
promote ethical standards of behaviour and strengthen the
Bank’s accountability and transparency. Throughout the
region, OCCO plays a vital role in EBRD efforts to promote
integrity and strengthen governance, which the Bank’s
revised transition concept recognises as an essential
feature of a market economy.
     The Chief Compliance Officer (CCO) reports directly
to the President and the Audit Committee of the Board
of Directors, as described in the Integrity Risks Policy and
Terms of Reference for OCCO, available online. These also
set out how OCCO fulfils its mission and helps the EBRD
manage integrity risks related to clients and to the personal
conduct of Bank staff. Thorough integrity due diligence
is integrated into the approval of new business and the
monitoring of ongoing operations. Furthermore, OCCO
enhances the transition impact of projects by providing
advice on integrity concerns and by recommending and
monitoring improvements to the corporate governance
and anti-corruption strategies of Bank counterparties.
     OCCO is responsible for investigating allegations of staff
misconduct as well as allegations of fraud and corruption
in relation to EBRD projects and counterparties. Allegations
of staff misconduct are investigated under the Conduct and
Disciplinary Rules and Procedures (CDRPs). These were
revised in 2015 and the changes took effect in 2016, along
with the new Harassment-Free and Respectful Workplace
