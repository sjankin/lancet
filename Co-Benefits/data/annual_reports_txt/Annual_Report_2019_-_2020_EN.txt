EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
This Report presents progress made towards implementation of the Revised Regional
Indicative Strategic Development Plan (RISDP) and Strategic Indicative Plan for the
Organ (SIPO) by the SADC Secretariat in collaboration with the Member States and other
stakeholders in implementing the SADC regional cooperation and integration
programmes during the 2019/20 fiscal year.
Regional Political and economic Developments
The political and security situation in the Region remained generally stable, despite some
instability mostly in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo and insurgent attacks in
Cabo Delgado, in the northern of Mozambique. Furthermore, the region witnessed
Member States holding regular national democratic elections and a growing trend of
contested elections in some Member States.
The economic performance of the SADC region in 2019 slowed down when compared to
the previous years, with the real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth averaged 2.0%
lower than an average of 2.9% realised in the three preceding years from 2016 to 2018.
The deterioration was in line with the weak commodity prices, slowdown in global
economic activity and escalated global trade tensions, with the severity varying across
the SADC Member States. Provisionally, the annual regional inflation increased to an
average of 12.1% in 2019 from an average of 8.2% in 2018. However, excluding Angola
and Zimbabwe who recorded inflation rates of 17.1% and 109% in 2019, respectively, the
average inflation for SADC region slowed down to 4.3% in 2019 from 7.1% in 2018. In
2020, the regional economic growth is expecting a contraction of about 3% mainly due to
adverse impact of COVID-19.
Industrial Development and Market Integration
Regarding implementation of the Industrialization Strategy and Roadmap, the SADC
Protocol on Industry in August 2019 was approved by the 39th SADC Summit in August
2019 and to date Seychelles has ratified the Protocol. In the area of regional value chain,
the SADC Regional Mining Vision (RMV) and Action Plan were approved by Council in
August 2019; and a number of initiatives were implemented towards market integration
and promotion of quality and standards infrastructure necessary for competitiveness of
goods produced in the Region.
Notable progress was achieved in the area of payments systems whereby at national
level. By end of March 2019, all Member States were implementing Real Time Gross
Settlement System (RTGS). As RTGS facilitates quicker transactions and brings about
efficiency in payments, more than 1.8 million transactions have been settled as at end of
March 2020, representing ZAR 7.17 Trillion since July 2013 when the system went live.
The region has performed impressively in the area of financial inclusion by attaining a
6

-----------------------Page 6 End-----------------------

target of 32% of adults in the region who are financially excluded which is around 45.7
million individuals against the target of 25% by 2021.Financial inclusion is a key enabler
in contributing to poverty reduction and boosting prosperity.
Infrastructure in Support of Regional Integration
Progress was made towards realization of SADC Infrastructure Vision 2027 and
contribution towards the Industrialization Strategy and Roadmap through implementation
of various initiatives. In the energy sector, the Region commissioned 3,595 Megawatts
(MW) which is about 90% of the targeted capacity of 4,000 MW. A number of policy,
regulatory and strategic frameworks documents for Tripartite Transport and Transit
Facilitation Programme (TTTFP) were approved by Ministers of Transport in October
2019.
In the water sector, the Kunene Transboundary Water Supply Project was completed and
over 330 households were provided with clean and reliable water supply in Calueque
village. The intervention has further ensured provision of improved assurance of potable
water supply to the Santa Clara community. Furthermore, the Secretariat through
SARCIS-DR deployed a number of meteorological equipment to Member States and
continued to provide timely weather and climate information in order to minimize adverse
effects of severe weather and climate phenomena
Significant strides have been made since the launch of the Tripartite Free Trade Area
(TFTA) in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt, in 2015, whereby, the draft Tripartite Agreement on
Movement of Business Persons was finalised, legally scrubbed and adopted. The Nontariff measures data databases was classified, validated and HS coding completed for six
(6) tripartite pilot countries. Moreover, a number of instruments were developed to
facilitate implementation of the Tripartite FTA Agreement.
Special Programmes of Regional Dimension
In the Agriculture Sector, plans, guidelines, strategies and frameworks were developed
and approved. These include: the SADC Seed Centre Sustainability Plan and the
Guidelines for Seed Certification and Quality Assurance; the Regional Strategy on
Conservation and Utilization of Animal Genetic Resources (AnGR); Anti-Microbial
Resistance (AMR) Framework and Dog-Mediated human rabies Strategy; and the SADC
Great Green Wall Initiative. The region also attained an increase in aquaculture
production from 92,773 tons in 2019, to 100,950 tons in 2020 as part of the
implementation of the SADC Regional Aquaculture Strategy.
In the Social and Human Development component, Member States continued to align
their National qualification frameworks to Regional standards. To date, South Africa and
Seychelles have successfully aligned while other member states have reached an
advanced stage in the alignment process, including Mauritius which submitted its
Alignment Report for Adjudication.

-----------------------Page 7 End-----------------------

The new SADC Labour Migration Action Plan (2020-2025) was adopted to promote skills
transfer and matching labour supply and demand for regional development and
integration. The SADC Guidelines on Portability of Social Security Benefits were also
adopted to ensure that workers moving within the SADC region maintain social security
rights and benefits acquired under the jurisdiction of different Member States. In addition,
various frameworks were developed to guide and inform interventions on malaria control;
the quality of young children’s diets; and youth innovation, entrepreneurship, leadership
and participation in the SADC region.
An Analytical Assessment of Gender Mainstreaming in the SADC Regional Integration
Agenda was finalised and the final Report shared with Member States. In addition, the
SADC Regional Multi-Dimensional Women's Economic Empowerment Programme
(RMDWEEP) was approved, which seek to promote implementation of SADC
commitments on the economic empowerment of women. Furthermore, the Secretariat
continued to popularize the SADC Regional Strategy and Framework of Action for
Addressing GBV (2018-2030).
Crosscutting Programmes
In the area of Statistics, the Secretariat achieved a significant milestone in the
development of a Protocol on Statistics, which serves data needs for policy instruments
for regional integration. In additional, several regional statistical publications were
produced and disseminated to stakeholders.
Finally, the SADC Regional Resource Mobilisation Framework was finalized and
approved by the Council of Ministers in August 2019 to ensure sustainable financing
mechanisms for implementation of regional programmes. The Secretariat also continued
to strengthen cooperation with the International Cooperating Partners (ICPs) in order to
facilitate mobilization of resources for implementation of the priority regional programmes
and projects that are aligned to the SADC priorities. In view of this, several agreements
and legal instruments were concluded with a number of ICPs that continue to extend
technically and financially support towards regional integration.

1. INTRODUCTION
Under the Chairmanship of the United Republic of Tanzania, the SADC Region’s focus
during the 2019/20 Financial Year was underpinned by the theme “Creating a Conducive
Business Environment for Inclusive and Sustainable Industrial Development” under which
the Regional body made significant strides towards deepening regional integration,
achieving and maintaining peace, security and stability, and growth and development in
line with its Treaty objectives as well as outlined in the RISDP 2015/2020.
Notable progress was made during the past year in all priority areas which include
Industrial Development and Market Integration, Infrastructure in Support of Regional
Integration, Peace and Security Cooperation, Special Programs of Regional Dimension,
and Crosscutting Issues. This Report therefore, accounts for the implementation of the
SADC Secretariat 2019/20 Annual Corporate Plan which aimed to operationalize the last
year of the Revised RISDP and the annual theme. It unfolds the main achievements
during the year, challenges and mitigation measured in six chapters presented as follows:
•

The Report concludes by outlining the main challenges encountered during
implementation of the 2019/20 Financial Year commitments as well as lessons learned
and mitigation measures to pave way for the 2020/21 Financial Year.

2. REGIONAL POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC
DEVELOPMENTS
2.1

POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS

The political and security situation in the Region has remained generally stable,
notwithstanding isolated pockets of instability mostly in the Eastern parts of the
Democratic Republic of Congo, with the continuation of terrorist attacks perpetrated by
the negative forces, and insurgent attacks fuelled by religious extremism and radicalism
in Cabo Delgado, in the Northern parts of Mozambique.

9

-----------------------Page 9 End-----------------------

Member States have continued to adhere to democratic values and practices by holding
regular national democratic elections in accordance with the SADC Principles and
Guidelines Governing Democratic Elections. Nonetheless, the region has witnessed a
growing trend of contested elections in some Member States. Furthermore, the outbreak
of the COVID-19 pandemic compelled Member States holding elections in 2020 (Malawi,
United Republic of Tanzania and the Seychelles), to put in place measures that affect the
normal electoral processes, such as in the partial suspension of civil and political rights
through restrictions in freedoms of gatherings, movement, and speech.
In the Kingdom of Lesotho prospects of sustained political stability have been amplified
by the smooth and peaceful transition of power, with the swearing in of Right Honorable
Dr Moeketsi Majoro as Prime Minister on 19 May 2020, and the formation of a new
government Coalition between the All Basotho Convention and the Democratic Congress
parties.
Whilst the impact of the COVID-19 on governance, peace and security is yet to be fully
explored, it is imperative that the Region prepares adequately for imminent COVID-19
and post-COVID-19 pandemic scenarios which may present serious challenges to peace
and security at both national and regional level. To that extent, the Secretariat has
prepared an assessment of the socio-economic impact of COVID-19 which will be
considered by Council and Summit in August 2020.

2.2

ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS

2.2.1 GLOBAL ECONOMIC BACKGROUND
Economic Activity
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) World Economic Outlook report of April 2019
indicates a decline in global growth to 2.9% in 2019 from 3.6% in 2018. As a result of the
COVID-19 pandemic, the global economy is projected to contract sharply by negative 3%
in 2020, much worse than during the 2008–09 financial crisis. The downward revision
primarily reflects trade policy uncertainty, geopolitical tensions, and idiosyncratic stress
in key emerging market economies continued to weigh on global economic activity, in
particular manufacturing and trade, in the second half of 2019. Social unrest continued to
intensify and posed new challenges in several countries, as did weather-related disasters,
such as hurricanes in the Caribbean, drought and bushfires in Australia, floods in eastern
Africa, and drought in southern Africa.

Growth in emerging and developing economies, which accounts for over half of the world
growth receded to 3.7% in 2019 from 4.5% in 2018. The growth markdown largely reflects
a decline in domestic demand which slowed more sharply than expected amid stress in
the nonbank financial sector and a decline in credit growth. India’s growth averaged 4.8%
in 2019, down from 6.8% in 2018. India’s economy was held back by sector-specific
weaknesses in the automobile sector and real estate as well as lingering uncertainty
about the health of nonbank financial companies. In Mexico, growth slowed sharply during
the first half of 2019 owing to elevated policy uncertainty, budget under-execution, and
some transitory factors. In South Africa, growth remained subdued at 0.4% despite slight
recovery from electricity supply. Growth in China slowed down to 6.1% in 2019 from 6.6%
in 2018. This was a result of unresolved disputes on broader US-China economic
relations as well as required domestic financial regulatory strengthening to rein in shadow
banking.
In sub-Saharan Africa, growth picked slightly from 3.2% in 2018 to 3.3% in 2019. This
largely reflects a more challenging external environment, continued output disruptions in
oil-exporting countries, and weaker-than-anticipated growth in South Africa.
Developments in Commodity Prices
Commodity prices remained subdued in 2019. In the third quarter of 2019, almost all
major commodity price indexes fell, led by energy, which declined more than 8 percent.
Agriculture and metals prices declined by 2 percent, respectively. This may be attributed
to multi-year-high stock levels for some grains, notably rice and wheat, favourable
weather conditions in key producing regions and weakening demand for some

11

-----------------------Page 11 End-----------------------

commodities. Trade tensions, combined with weakness in global goods trade,
manufacturing, and output growth, were weighing on commodity demand. In contrast,
precious metal prices gained nearly 12% on heightened uncertainty.

The IMF and World Bank Commodity Prices Indices, show that commodity prices were
largely driven by changes in energy and metal categories. Energy prices fell sharply,
reaching their lowest level in two years. Oil prices dropped by 8% as worries about
slowing global demand outweighed temporary production disruptions in Saudi Arabia.
The World Bank’s Metals Price Index declined by 2% in 2019, which reflects a slowdown
in global manufacturing activity, a prolonged stall in trade negotiations between China
and the United States, and receding supply concerns for some metals.

12

-----------------------Page 12 End-----------------------

In contrast to other commodities, precious metals prices rose by 13% in the third quarter
of 2019 (quarter on quarter). Precious metals prices benefited from the United States
monetary policy easing, heightened global uncertainty and robust demand.
The SADC region economic connectedness to the world including to China is mainly
through trade, investment flows and financial market linkages. Trade between China and
the SADC region over the past decade was characterised by significant growth in exports
and imports. SADC exports to China increased from about 5% in 2000 to about 17% in
2018 before it took a plateau, largely driven by the demand for primary commodities to
sustain China’s industrialisation-anchored economic growth. Approximately 70% of the
region’s exports to China are related to commodities, particularly oil, minerals, and
metals. As such, the decline in commodity prices has a potential to worsen existing
vulnerabilities of Member States who are highly dependent on commodity exports and
further bring diversification to the agenda as the only option to curtail external shocks that
emanates from strongly relying on traditional commodity exports. In an event terms of
trade unwind, policymakers should be vigilant not to overestimate the shortfall of Gross
Domestic Product (GDP) from potential growth, unless there are signals that economic
activity is trending below potential. The continuing slow growth in SADC region holds back
the fiscal revenues of countries. Therefore, there is need to find alternative sources of
revenue to reduce their exposure, by strengthening tax administration, minimizing tax
evasion, expanding the tax rates on natural resources, and reducing corruption.
Developments in Global Foreign Direct Investment and Debt
Global Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) receded to $1.39 trillion in 2019, a 1% decline
from $1.41 trillion recorded in 2018. This is against the backdrop of weaker
macroeconomic performance and policy uncertainty for investors, including trade
tensions. FDI flows to developed countries dropped by 6% to $643 billion. FDI to the
European Union (EU) plummeted by 15% to $305 billion, while flows to the United States
remained stable at $251 billion. Flows to developing economies remained unchanged at
$695 billion. FDI increased by 16% in Latin America and the Caribbean and 3% in Africa.
Despite a decline of 6 percent, flows to developing Asia continued to account for onethird of global FDI in 2019. Flows to transition economies rose by two thirds to $57 billion.
FDI flows to Africa amounted approximately $49 billion in 2019, a 3% increase from 2018.
Persistent global economic uncertainty and the slow pace of reforms seeking to address
structural productivity bottlenecks in many economies continue to weigh down investment
in the continent. Egypt remained the largest FDI recipient in Africa with a 5% inflows surge
to $8.5 billion. This is attributed to economic reforms that boosted the country’s investor
confidence. Sectors that benefited from FDI include oil and gas, telecommunications, real
estate and tourism.
In terms of global debt, the negative impact of COVID-19 is likely to trigger a wave of
defaults around the world. In December 2019, global debt levels had reached an all-time

13

-----------------------Page 13 End-----------------------

high of $253 trillion. About 70% of global debt is held by advanced economies and about
30% is held by emerging markets and developing countries. Globally, a significant debt
share is held by nonfinancial corporations and governments.
The IMF Fiscal Monitor of April 2020 indicates that global government spending and
revenue measures towards sustaining economic activity since the beginning of 2020 up
to April 2020 amounted to $3.3 trillion and that loans, equity injections and guarantees
totalled an additional $4.5 trillion. Due to the increasing need of resources to deal with
COVID-19, the global fiscal deficit is expected to widen from 3.7 % of GDP in 2019 to
9.9% of GDP in 2020, whilst borrowing by governments globally is projected to increase
to 96.4% of GDP in 2020 from 83.3% of GDP in 2019.
2.2.2 REGIONAL ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE
Overview
Preliminary data provided by Member States in April 2020 and the World Economic
Outlook indicate that the SADC’s average real GDP growth in 2019 slowed down and
prospects in the short to medium term remain gloomy. Annual inflation rate eased in
general, with only three Member States recording double digit levels. This was largely
reflecting favourable weather conditions and significant decline in global energy prices.
The pass-through of lower energy prices is expected to more than offset the lingering
effects from past exchange rate depreciation.
The regional average fiscal deficit continued to improve in 2019, largely due to tax reforms
and improvements in financial management in Member States. Public debt continued on
an upward trend on the brink of breaching the regional threshold of 60% of GDP despite
the improvement in fiscal positions in 2019.
The region’s external position in 2019 deteriorated in line with the weak commodity prices,
slowdown in global economic activity and escalated global trade tensions. However, the
severity varied across the SADC Member States.
Real GDP
Since the 2008 global financial crisis, the regional economy has been performing below
the pre-crisis period largely due to weak commodity prices and frequent occurrence of
extreme climatic events in the region. The SADC’s average real GDP growth in 2019
averaged 2.0% lower than an average of 2.9% realised in the three preceding years from
2016 to 2018. Some countries like Democratic Republic of Congo, Madagascar, Malawi,
Mauritius, Seychelles and Tanzania observed strengthened growth levels. Only Tanzania
achieved the regional real GDP growth target of 7%.
Reflecting developments in GDP, the general standard of living in the SADC region is
deteriorating as revealed by the decline in the regional average per capita GDP from

14

-----------------------Page 14 End-----------------------

US$4031.97 in 2018 to an estimated US$3951 in 2019. The living standards within the
region as measured by per capita GDP vary amongst the Member States. Five Member
States (Kingdom of Eswatini, Lesotho, Mauritius, Seychelles and Tanzania) recorded per
capita GDP improvements. Seychelles, with the highest per capita GDP in SADC of
US$17052, Botswana, Mauritius, Namibia, Seychelles and South Africa maintained per
capita GDP of more than the regional average. Figure 2 also shows that nine Member
States (Comoros, Democratic Republic of Congo, Lesotho, Madagascar, Malawi,
Mozambique, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe) are expected to record per capita GDP
below US$2000 in 2019.

Inflation
Provisional figures show that annual regional inflation increased to an average of 12.1%
in 2019 from an average of 8.2% in 2018, largely due to heightened inflationary pressures
in Angola and Zimbabwe who recorded inflation rates of 17.1% and 109% in 2019,
respectively. The average inflation for SADC region excluding Angola and Zimbabwe
slowed down to 4.3% in 2019 from 7.1% in 2018, reflecting how the two Member States
inflation are amplifying the regional average inflation in 2019. The Member States who
achieved single digit average inflation benefited from the weak commodity prices
especially oil price which is a major determinant of prices in the region. Only four Member
States (Angola, Malawi, Zambia and Zimbabwe) missed the inflation target range of 37% in 2019 compared to 2018 where five Member States (Angola, Democratic Republic
of Congo, Mauritius, Zambia and Zimbabwe) missed the regional inflation target. Notable
price changes are expected to be realised by Democratic Republic of Congo and
Zimbabwe. Democratic Republic of Congo average inflation is estimated to decline from
30.8% in 2018 to 5.5% in 2019. On the other hand, severe build up in inflationary
pressures in Zimbabwe has seen average inflation estimated to increase to 109% in 2019
compared to 10.6% in 2018.

National Savings and Investments
In 2019, total investments and gross national savings remained subdued below the
regional target of 30% of GDP. After a decline from 26.2% of GDP in 2015 to 23.5% of
GDP in 2016, total investments have been on a steady increase up to 2019. The region
recorded an increase in total investments to 27.1% of GDP in 2019 from 23.5% of GDP
in 2018. Only five Member States (Botswana, Lesotho, Mozambique, Tanzania and
Zambia) recorded investments above the regional target (see Figure 3).

Gross national savings are expected to remain below 20% of GDP at 18.7% of GDP in
2019 from 18.8% of GDP in 2018. Botswana, Tanzania and Zambia recorded total gross
national savings above the regional target of 30% of GDP.
The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) Trends Monitor
Report (January 2020) indicates that FDI to SADC region increased by 37% to US$5.5
billion in 2019 mainly due to the slowdown in net divestment from Angola. South Africa
consolidated last year’s recovery with inflows remaining almost constant at a little more
than US$5 billion. In addition to intra-company transfers by existing investors, investment
to the country was led by mergers and acquisitions in business services and petroleum
refining. In 2018, FDI flows to the region recovered to nearly US$4.2 billion, from a net
outflow of US$925 million in 2017. FDI flows to South Africa more than doubled to $5.3
billion in 2018, contributing to progress in the Government’s campaign to attract $100
billion of FDI by 2023. The surge in inflows was largely due to intra-company loans as
well as significant portfolio investments.
Fiscal Sector
The global economic developments and weak commodity prices continued to weigh down
the regional economy in 2019 and these had varying negative impacts on the fiscal

16

-----------------------Page 16 End-----------------------

positions of Member States. The regional average fiscal deficit continued to improve since
2017. Fiscal deficit as a percentage of GDP improved from 4.1% of GDP in 2018 to 3.4%
of GDP in 2019, largely due to tax reforms and improvements in financial management in
Member States (see Figure 4). In 2019, Lesotho and Mozambique joined Angola,
Democratic Republic of Congo, Madagascar, Seychelles and Tanzania who met the fiscal
deficit target of 3% of GDP in 2018. Mauritius, which met the target in 2018 slightly missed
out in 2019 with a deficit of 3.2% of GDP. Five Member States, Angola, Lesotho,
Madagascar, Mozambique and Zimbabwe made commendable improvements in their
fiscal positions in 2019.

Public Debt

Source: Member States and IMF WEO April 2020.

Public debt continued on an upward trend on the brink of breaching the regional threshold
of 60% of GDP despite the improvement in fiscal positions in 2019. This is mainly due to
debt not directly related to budget financing. The region’s public debt averaged 59.9% of
GDP in 2019 up from 48.8% recorded in 2018. Significant increases in debt levels were
observed in Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Angola and Kingdom of Eswatini which added
89.3%, 22.9%, 22.0% and 16.9%, respectively. The number of Member States that did
not meet the regional target of public debt of 60% of GDP increased in 2019 with South
Africa and Zimbabwe joining the 2018 group of Angola, Malawi, Mozambique and
Zambia. The increasing public debt levels will put additional burden to the Member States
resources as debt service costs increase.
External Sector
The region’s external position in 2019 deteriorated in line with the weak commodity prices,
slowdown in global economic activity and escalated global trade tensions. However, the
severity varied across the SADC Member States. The regional current account balance
slightly widened from an average deficit of 5.6% of GDP in 2018 to 5.8% of GDP in 2019.
17

-----------------------Page 17 End-----------------------

Notable changes of the current account position in 2019 were in Mozambique where the
current account deficit widened by an estimated 11.3% of GDP whilst in Zimbabwe it
narrowed by an estimated 9.2% of GDP to achieve a surplus. Mozambique current
account reflected the increase in capital goods importation, whilst narrowing of the current
account deficit in Zimbabwe was driven by a 32% contraction in imports following import
compression measures instituted by government.

Seven countries (Angola, Kingdom of Eswatini, Madagascar, Namibia, Tanzania, Zambia
and Zimbabwe) were able to meet the regional target of 3% of GDP. Notably, Malawi,
Mozambique and Seychelles recorded the largest current account deficits, 15.1 percent,
67% and 16.5%, respectively, in 2019. However, for Malawi and Seychelles, this was an
improvement from a deficit of 19.7% and 17.8% in 2018, respectively.

In terms of foreign exchange reserves, SADC average import cover slightly improved from
4.4 months of imports in 2018 to 5.2 months of import cover in 2019, but remained below
the regional target of 6 months of imports cover. Only three Member States (Angola,
Botswana and Mauritius) recorded external reserves above the regional target of 6
months import cover. The rest of the Member States did not meet the criterion of 6 months
of import cover, with some of them falling short of the IMF benchmark of 3 months of
import cover.
External sector developments resulted in exchange rates of SADC countries depreciate
at varying magnitudes in 2019. The Angolan Kwanza and the Zambian Kwacha recorded
the largest depreciation in the region. The Kwanza depreciated, on average, by 4% during
2019, the largest depreciation of about 30% was recorded in October 2019. Recent data
shows that, until the end of March 2020, the Angolan kwanza, had lost more than 10 %of
its value against the dollar in relation to the beginning of the year, and more than 40% in
recent months. Against the US dollar, the Zambian Kwacha depreciated by 23.4% to an
annual average of K12.92. The depreciation of the Kwacha was mainly on account of
subdued supply of foreign exchange amidst escalating demand for the importation of
petroleum products, electricity and agricultural inputs. In addition, adverse market
sentiments associated with Zambia’s credit rating downgrades weighed on the Kwacha.
As of March 2020, the exchange rate averaged K16.53 per US dollar.

The volatility of the exchange rates varied during the period under review. The Angolan
kwanza, the Malawian kwacha and the South African rand were the most volatile
currencies during the review period with standard deviations of 38.8, 15.0 and 8.2,
respectively. The least volatile currencies were the Seychellois rupee, the Tanzanian
shilling and the Congolese frank with standard deviations of 0.5, 0.7 and 1.0, respectively.
The evolution of South African Rand exchange rate developments as a proxy for the
SADC region remained relatively stable oscillating between R14 and R16 per US dollar.
As shown in Figure 8 the exchange rate to US dollar depreciated from R13.17 at the end
of 2017 to R14.18 in 2018, before experiencing minimum variations to close 2019 at
R14.44.

Business Environment
Data from the World Bank Ease of Doing Business 2020-21 indicate that the SADC region
improved slightly in terms of making a conducive business environment and its
competitiveness in general. Seven Member States showed improvements in the ease of
doing business ranking, namely: Democratic Republic of Congo, Malawi, Mauritius,
Namibia, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe, compared to the six recorded in 2018. Two
Member States (Mauritius and Zimbabwe) demonstrated exceptional improvements by
moving up more than 3 positions from 20 in 2018 to 13 in 2019 and 155 in 2018 to 140 in
2019, respectively. On the other hand, Angola, Botswana, Kingdom of Eswatini, Lesotho,
Mozambique, Seychelles, and South Africa slightly dropped in their ranking positions in
2019 compared to 2018 performance. In 2019, four SADC Member States (Botswana,

20

-----------------------Page 20 End-----------------------

Mauritius, South Africa and Zambia) were ranked within the top 100 and this was a
deterioration from the five recorded in 2017 and 2018 (see Figure 9).

The development with regard to improving the business environment shows a similar
trend with the World Economic Forum Global Competitiveness Index (GCI). The GCI
measures the competitiveness of an economy by considering all factors from basic factors
that enable it to be competitive to factors that make it efficient and innovative (see Figure
10).

Democratic Republic of Congo, Kingdom of Eswatini, Lesotho, Madagascar, Mauritius,
Mozambique, Seychelles, Tanzania and Zambia) deteriorated in the ranking of 2019.
In 2019, Mauritius, South Africa, Botswana and Seychelles remained the most

Seychelles and Mauritius dropped by 2 and 3 positions, respectively.

2.3

REGIONAL PROSPECTS FOR 2020 -21

In line with the global economic outlook, the SADC regional economy which was
forecasted to recover in 2020 according to the October 2019 World Economic Outlook
has seen significant downward revision due to adverse impact of COVID-19. Resultantly,
SADC regional 2020 economic growth initially forecasted at 3.3% in October 2019, has
been revised downwards to a contraction of about 3 per cent. Disruptions of economic
activity and the elevated expenditures by Governments coupled with economic packages
in response to the pandemic is expected to affect the fiscal positions for SADC Member
States. Consequently, fiscal deficit is forecasted to widen to 5.7% of GDP in 2020
compared to the previous estimate of 3.0% of GDP. Additionally, debt levels are
forecasted to increase beyond the regional threshold of 60% of GDP to 69.8% of GDP in
2020.

22

-----------------------Page 22 End-----------------------

The estimated regional and global economic contraction and the resultant weak demand
in commodities are expected to result in a deterioration of the SADC external position
with current account deficit forecasted to widen to about 9% of GDP in 2020 from an initial
estimate of 4.2% of GDP. The deterioration of the external position coupled with the
increased importation of medical supplies and equipment will put pressure on foreign
reserves and exchange rates of SADC Member States, which may result in significant
exchange rates depreciation across the region in 2020. The longevity of the pandemic
will determine the severity of the economic impact.

3. IMPLEMENTATION OF PROGRAMMES OF
REGIONAL COOPERATION AND INTEGRATION
3.1

INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT AND MARKET INTEGRATION

3.1.1 INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT
The revised RISDP 2015-2020 and the Industrialization Strategy and Roadmap foresees
the lifting of the regional growth rate of real GDP from 4% annually (since 2000) to a
minimum of 7% a year. In addition, to double the share of Manufacturing Value Added
(MVA) in GDP to 30% by 2030 and to 40% by 2050, including the share of industry-related
services; and to increase the share of medium-and-high-technology production in total
MVA from less than 15% at present to 30% by 2030 and 50% by 2050.
The SADC Protocol on Industry was approved by the 39th SADC Summit held in Dar es
Salaam, Tanzania in August 2019. The Protocol aims to improve the policy environment
for industrial development and support implementation of the regional industrialization
strategy and roadmap, The Protocol will enter into force following ratification by two-thirds
of SADC Member States, and by end of March 2020, only Seychelles had ratified the
Protocol.
Furthermore, in order to ensure an integrated strategy for Small and Medium Enterprise
(SME) development in the region, the Secretariat developed a Regional Framework for
Supplier Development with the special focus on building capacities and capabilities of
SMEs to participate in the implementation of the Industrialization Strategy and regional
value chains.
3.1.2 REGIONAL VALUE CHAINS
The Secretariat profiled one agro-processing and one services value chain, bringing the
total to four (4) profiled value chains in the six priority clusters, while the other two were
under the minerals and pharmaceuticals sectors. The SADC Regional Mining Vision
(RMV) and Action Plan were developed and approved by Council in August 2019 to

23

-----------------------Page 23 End-----------------------

ensure that there is increased production and use of SADC raw materials as feedstock
for downstream processing.
Other initiatives pursued during the period under review, aiming to ensure improvement
of quality and standards infrastructure necessary to promote competitiveness of goods
produced in the Region include the follows:
(i)

The SADC Cooperation in Standardisation (SADCSTAN) harmonised 111
standards for adoption and use by the SADC Member States. These regionally
harmonised texts exist in the food and agriculture; transport; medicine; safety,
conformity assessment, construction and environmental management sectors.
Article 7(4) of the TBT Annex compels all SADC Member States to withdraw
any conflicting national standard once a regionally harmonised text has been
adopted.

(ii)

The SADC Cooperation Structure in legal Metrology established the SADC
regional e-Mark scheme to ensure the conformity of pre-packaged
commodities sold on the SADC market. This ensures that consumers pay for
assured quantities.

(iii)

The SADC Cooperation on measurement traceability implemented two SADC
regional proficiency testing schemes in the areas of chemical analysis and in
microbiological testing of water. This is aimed at ensuring a high level of water
testing capability of the one-hundred participating laboratories of the SADC
region and to ensure that SADC citizens consume safe water. SADCMET also
developed and distributed to SADC Member States, a Virtual Reality
Calibration Application for training metrologists in the fields of Mass, Volume,
Dimensional, Temperature & Pressure metrology. Following the revision of the
popularly used worldwide standard ISO/IEC 17025:2017 in November 2019,
SADCMET offered laboratory practitioners in the SADC Member States a
bridging course on the two versions of the standard. This aimed to ensure that
SADC laboratories implement sound quality systems and demonstrate that
they are technically competent and able to produce valid and reliable results.

(iv) The SADC Accreditation Service (SADCAS) has to date developed 8
internationally recognised accreditation schemes; trained and registered 113
accreditation assessors in the various conformity assessment standards,
which cover ISO/IEC 17020; 17025; 17021 and 15189.
(v)

The SADC Technical Barriers to Trade Expert Group (TBTEG) annually
convenes the SADC Quality Awards Competition, which is open to all private
and public sector entities that have successfully applied standards and quality
principles in order to improve their operations. In 2019/20, the competition was
in its 12th cycle and it was entered into by twenty-two entities from five SADC
Member States. The highest number of Member States to have entered the
24

-----------------------Page 24 End-----------------------

competition since inception stands at eight, which leaves ample room for
improvement.
(vi) In terms of SPS Infrastructure, Phytosanitary regulations for 21 fresh
horticultural fruits and 19 horticultural plants for planting and trading amongst
Member States were harmonised. The purpose of the harmonisation is to
enhance safer and faster movement of horticultural fruits through
establishment of science based phytosanitary measures. Plant Health experts
from eleven SADC Member States that were participating in the regional fruitfly project sponsored by the FAO, were trained on the development of pest
database using Access Microsoft.
(vii) Four out of the sixteen SADC Member States have fully established national
SPS committees and the SADC Secretariat has prioritised the revival of
national SPS Committees, as they are crucial to the advancement of the
regional SPS agenda.
3.1.3 MARKET INTEGRATION
The SADC Industrialization Strategy and Roadmap foresees increase manufactured
exports to at least 50% of total exports by 2030 from less than 20% at present and to
build market share in the global market for the export of intermediate products to East
Asian levels of around 60% of total manufactured exports. Currently, thirteen SADC
Member States participate in the FTA while three are not yet participating, namely Angola,
Democratic Republic of Congo and the Comoros. Efforts are being made to consolidate
the FTA by bringing the remaining three Member States into the FTA.
Notable progress was achieved on the Tripartite Online Mechanism for Reporting,
Monitoring and Eliminating NTBs to Trade in COMESA, EAC and SADC. The mechanism
is fully operational and managed by EAC for Tripartite Member States. By end of 2019/20
Financial Year, seven (7) Member States (Botswana, Kingdom of Eswatini, Lesotho,
Mauritius, Mozambique, Seychelles, and South Africa) have ratified the Protocol on Trade
in Services. The first round of negotiations was completed in 6 priority sectors identified
in the Protocol namely communication, finance, tourism and transport services,
construction and energy-related services. The draft Framework on Simplified Trade
Regime (STR) and the E-Certificate of Origin Framework were considered by TNF Goods
in May 2019.
3.1.4 FINANCIAL MARKET INTEGRATION
Payment Systems
Notable progress was achieved in the area of payments systems. At national level all
Member States are implementing Real Time Gross Settlement System (RTGS). The
RTGS facilitates quicker transactions and brings about efficiency in payments.

25

-----------------------Page 25 End-----------------------

At regional level, harmonization of payments and clearing systems through the SADC
Real Time Gross Settlement System (RTGS) is ongoing. The SADC-RTGS supports the
modernization and harmonization of payments and clearing systems both domestically
and regionally with the objective of improving safety of payments and efficient settlement
and payment processes in the region. It is also intended to lower transaction costs as it
removes the need for correspondent bank. Where transactions previously took two to
three days to clear, with SADC-RTGS they are now settled in real-time, subject to
availability of funding at the paying bank.
All Member States (except Comoros) are participating in the SADC-RTGS and a total of
85 banks (Central Banks and Commercial Banks) are also participating in the system.
The SADC-RTGS has performed impressively since July 2013 when the system went
live, with more than 1.8 million transactions settled as at end of March 2020, representing
ZAR 7.17 Trillion. The Committee of Central Bank Governors (CCBG) is still engaging the
SADC Bankers Association to ensure that savings arising from removal of correspondent
bank in the system are passed on to consumers. The SADC RTGS multi-currency
platform went live in October 2018. Onboarding of the US$ has been delayed because of
challenges with opening of US$ account with the New York Federal Reserve. The CCBG
has now focused on the SADC Transfer Cleared on Immediate Basis (TCIB) payment
scheme.
Regarding the SADC-RTGS cross border low value credit transfer transactions, the
current focus is on implementation in the Common Monetary Area (CMA) where an
amended directive has been issued requiring the CMA payments industry to submit
recovery plans by 30 June 2020. An interim solution was developed to meet the minimum
requirements of Financial Action Task Force (FATF) Requirements 16 in anticipation of
FATF Assessment for South Africa. The CCBG continues to work with industry on the
Recovery Plan.
Financial Inclusion and Remittances
In the area of financial inclusion, 32% of adults in the region are financially excluded,
which is around 45.7 million individuals against the target of 25% by 2021. Overall levels
of financial inclusion vary considerably across the region, from 97% in Seychelles to 40%
in Mozambique. The operationalization of the SADC Financial Inclusion Subcommittee is
ongoing to coordinate the work on financial inclusion and build synergies among the
structures dealing with financial inclusion across the region.
With regard to cross border remittances in the region, which are critical for financial
inclusion and poverty alleviation, the main objective is to lower the average price of
remittances to the consumer, as well as appropriately increase the use of formal
channels. For instance, the cost of cross border remittances has been reduced by 3.6
percentage points from an average of 13% per transaction to about 9.4% in the corridor
between South Africa and Botswana, Kingdom of Eswatini, Lesotho, Malawi,

26

-----------------------Page 26 End-----------------------

Mozambique, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe. The challenge is to further reduce these
costs to meet the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals target of 3% by 2030.
Furthermore, SADC migrants’ resident in South Africa are estimated to remit
approximately R21.9 billion home annually, with R11.3 billion (representing 52%)
transiting trough informal channel. Migrants using formal remittance channels are
estimated to send as much as R12,000 annually or R1,000 per month while informal
remitters send in the order of R550 per month.
3.1.5 DEVELOPMENT FINANCE
With regard to project preparation, the SADC Project Preparation Development Facility
(SADC - PPDF) funded by the European Union and KfW and hosted by the Development
Bank of Southern Africa (DBSA), continues to support Member States to strengthen
regional infrastructure connectivity, by providing grants for project preparation and
development for cross-border regional infrastructure projects in energy, transport, ICT
and trans-boundary water. This directly supports the region’s integration and
industrialization efforts as well as trade in goods and services; and helps to improve the
quality of lives of its people by improving access to infrastructure services. PPDF supports
SADC countries to undertake feasibility, technical and engineering designs,
environmental and social impact assessment studies, as well as preparation of tender
documents and transaction advisory services to make projects bankable for financing and
implementation.
By 2019, PPDF approved a total of US $ 22.2 million for the preparation of thirteen
regional projects covering energy, transport and water which is expected to generate US$
5.85 billion in infrastructure investment. This has the huge potential of unlocking business
opportunities across the “infrastructure value chain”, not just in advisory services, but also
financing, construction, equipment supply, technology and skills as well as operations and
maintenance. The thirteen regional projects are:
(i)

Mozambique – Zimbabwe – South Africa (MOZISA) interconnectivity
project;

(ii)

Second Alaska – Sherwood 400 kV line;

(iii)

Kasomeno – Mwenda Toll Road (Democratic Republic of Congo, Zambia);

(iv)

Rehabilitation and upgrade of the North South Rail Corridor (South Africa,
Zimbabwe, Zambia, Democratic Republic of Congo and Botswana);

(v)

Luapula Hydro Power Development (Zambia);

(vi)

Angola – Namibia Transmission Interconnector;

(vii)

Mulembo Lelya Hydro Electric Power (Democratic Republic of Congo and
Zambia);

(viii)

Africa Green Co (all Member States);

27

-----------------------Page 27 End-----------------------

(ix)

Development of Guidelines and Standards for Renewable Energy Projects
and a Funding and Incentive Strategy Project (Mauritius);

(x)

Angola – Namibia Transmission Interconnector – Extension of preparation
funding – Part 2 and 3 Feasibility up to Financial Close;

(xi)

Wastewater Pumping Station and Wastewater Treatment Plant (Mauritius);

(xii)

Lomahasha – Namaacha Cross Border Water Supply (Kingdom of Eswatini
and Mozambique) and Kazungula Water Supply and Sanitation Project
(Zambia).

The MOZISA project was cancelled at the PPDF Steering Committee meeting held on the
11 December 2019 due to the slow progress of the project.
Following the findings of PPDF Mid-Term Review in 2018 by EU and assessment by
KFW, the Secretariat in collaboration with DBSA-PPDF developed an Action Plan for
Improving the Performance of PPDF which was considered and endorsed by the
Ministers of Finance in July 2019. A report on the status of implementation of the Action
Plan was presented to the SADC Committee of Ministers of Finance and Investment in
July 2020.
Work on the operationalisation of the SADC Regional Development Fund is ongoing. The
Agreement on the Operationalisation of the Fund was finalised and nine Member States
have signed the Agreement, namely: Angola, Democratic Republic of Congo, Lesotho,
Malawi, Mozambique, Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe. None has yet
submitted instruments of ratification of the Agreement with the Secretariat. Summit at its
meeting in August 2019 approved the Revised Roadmap on the operationalisation of the
Fund which is targeting its full operationalisation by August 2021. The Sustainable
Financing of Regional Infrastructure and Industrial Projects in SADC (AfDB Project) is
providing support to deepen regional integration in the region including the
operationalisation of the Fund.
3.1.6 INVESTMENT AND TAX RELATED MATTERS
SADC is implementing a Regional Action Programme for Investment (RAPI) to establish
a conducive environment for domestic and foreign investment which is recognised as a
major tool for sustainable growth, development and poverty reduction in the region. The
RAPI is organised around four pillars1.

1

Pillars of RAPI : The first being Development and harmonization of relevant polices and frameworks for attracting
and promotion of both domestic investment and FDI; the second pillar relates to business and investment

28

-----------------------Page 28 End-----------------------

Under the first pillar on development and harmonization of relevant polices and
frameworks for attracting and promotion of both domestic investment and FDI, the SADC
Investment Policy Framework (IPF) was finalised. This offers Member States a framework
for the formulation and operationalisation of sound investment policies that can promote
broad-based economic growth. In addition, a Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT) Template
has been developed and recommended to the Ministerial Task Force on Regional
Economic Integration for consideration and approval, aiming to provide advice to
governments in any future negotiations they enter into relating to investment treaties. The
SADC Secretariat has also secured technical and financial assistance from the World
Bank and the European Union to develop a SADC Investment Climate Scorecard.
Regarding the second pillar on business and investment promotion, SADC Business and
Investment Promotion Strategy (BIPS) is being developed. The SADC BIPS will allow
SADC to explore opportunities to showcase its programmes and regional projects to
various key decision-makers from around the world who are willing to engage in
sustainable partnerships, and further benefit from a variety of features aimed at facilitating
strategic networking and promoting Foreign Direct Investment.
3.1.7 MACROECONOMIC CONVERGENCE PROGRAMME
Preliminary data indicates that economic growth slowed down in 2019 reflective of the
sluggish global economic growth. Resultantly only Tanzania achieved the 7% economic
growth target in 2019 largely from massive infrastructure projects. There was notable
improvement in Member States performance against the Macro Economic Convergence
primary indicators (inflation, fiscal deficit and public debt). In 2019, the number of Member
States who achieved the three primary indicators increased to five (Democratic Republic
of Congo, Lesotho, Madagascar, Seychelles, Tanzania) from three (Mauritius, Seychelles
and Tanzania) in 2018. The number of Member States that achieved the inflation and
fiscal deficit targets increased to eleven and eight in 2019 from nine and six in 2018,
respectively. However, the number that achieved the public debt target decreased to nine
in 2019 compared to eleven in 2018, revealing the increasing debt levels which will lead
to debt distress in the region.

3.2

INFRASTRUCTURE IN SUPPORT FOR REGIONAL INTEGRATION

The overall objective of Infrastructure in Support of Regional Integration interventions is
to ensure the availability and universal access to sufficient, integrated, efficient, resilient
and cost-effective infrastructure systems as well as the provision of sustainable services.
The SADC Regional Infrastructure Development Master Plan (RIDMP) is a guiding

promotion; the third pillar relates to providing relevant information to businesses and investors; and the last Pillar
relates to peer to peer learning where investment promotion agencies share best practices in investment promotion.

instrument for implementation of Priority B of the Revised RISDP of the infrastructure
Support for deployment. The RIDMP focuses on the realisation of SADC Infrastructure
Vision 2027 and contributes towards the Industrialisation Strategy and Roadmap as well
as other regional strategic frameworks. During 2019/20 an Assessment Report for
RIDMP Short Term Action Plan I was completed and validated by Member States in June
2019 and the development of the Short Terms Action Plan II (2020- 2027) will commence
during 2020/2021 financial year. A number of infrastructure projects are at preparation
stage and coordinated in collaboration with the Regional Subsidiary Organisations and
the Project Preparation Facilities supported by the different International Cooperating
Partners (ICPs).
3.2.1 COMMUNICATIONS AND ICT
SADC Post Digital Terrestrial Television (DTT) Migration
The Digital Terrestrial Television (DTT) provides consumers better quality pictures and
sound. More importantly, it makes efficient use of the frequency spectrum which results
in more digital channels, hence more choice to consumers. It also results in a Digital
Dividend that is freeing up the frequency spectrum to new wireless technologies that can
be cost effective for reaching the rural areas of the SADC Region. To date, six (6) SADC
Member States (Kingdom of Eswatini, Malawi, Mauritius, Namibia, United Republic of
Tanzania and Zambia) have completed the DTT Migration process. Seven (7) Member
States (Angola, Botswana, Lesotho, Mozambique, Seychelles, South Africa, Zambia and
Zimbabwe) are at an advanced stage, operating both analogue and DTT networks (dual
illumination) and are to pursue Analogue Switch Off (ASO) by the end of 2020. The
remaining three (3) Member States have deployed DTT networks however they are
privately owned and providing Pay-TV services, mostly in the densely populated city
areas.
Availability of Set Top Boxes (STBs) for reception of DTT transmission remains a major
challenge. To complement the DTT networks, eight (8) Member States (Kingdom of
Eswatini, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, United Republic of Tanzania,
Zambia and Zimbabwe) are streaming their national public TV channel via the Internet
while four (4) Member States (Namibia, South Africa, United Republic of Tanzania and
Zimbabwe) have Mobile Apps to access respective public TV channels. Angola and
Botswana are piloting broadcasting TV content directly to mobile devices using 1Seg
capability of national DTT networks.
The SADC TV Channel called Eye on SADC is presently a thirty minutes SADC news
programme until it becomes a full-fledged channel. It is an initiative anchored on the
Revised SADC Communications and Promotional Strategy 2016-2020. In its pilot phase
it employs an online Content Sharing Hub Sharing. A successful demo of the SADC TV
Channel was made to the SADC ICT Ministers in September 2018 in Windhoek, Namibia.
Ten (10) Member States (Angola, Botswana, Kingdom of Eswatini, Lesotho, Malawi,

30

-----------------------Page 30 End-----------------------

Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, Zambia and Zimbabwe) are already broadcasting the
Eye on SADC. Presently, the language is English but SADC TV Channel will later carry
subtitles in other SADC Official languages which can be accessed using the DTT
technology through the STBs. The SADC TV Channel initiative is being refined and a
Business Plan is being develop to ensure it is a sustainable project.
Harmonisation of Number Plans for Emergency Services in SADC
SADC has harmonised the numbering plan for emergency services across the region,
making the use of the short codes ‘112’ for all the three (3) emergency services (Police,
Fire and Ambulance) and ‘116’ to access the child helpline services. The aim is to make
emergency-related numbers easy to recall and familiar to travellers, as they are very
critical for the safety and well-being of SADC Citizens.
SADC National and Regional Internet Exchange Points (IXPs)
The African Internet Exchange System (AXIS) Project has the objective of keeping
Africa’s Internet traffic local to the continent through the establishment of National Internet
Exchange Points (NIXPs) and Regional Internet Exchange Points (RIXPs) in Africa.
N/RIXPs are a vital component of the Internet eco-system and have optimized the
performance of the Internet in the SADC region by bringing about low latency, improved
throughput, and reduced costs related to international links. To date all SADC Member
States have set up at least one National IXP and as of December 2018, the IXPs from
South Africa and Zimbabwe completed the transformation process to fully operational
SADC RIXP. There are in excess of five (5) IXPs connected to the two SADC RIXPs.
RIXPs ensure that SADC traffic remains within the region. Member States have been
urged to establish dual N/RIXPs and their interconnection to each other thus creating a
SADC Internet exchange cloud of N/RIXPs (mesh network of RIXPs).
Cross-border connections to the RIXPs is a challenge. As such, the SADC Regional
Cross-Border Interconnection Policy Framework and Reference Interconnection Offer
(RIO) were developed to create a high level of transparency on tariffs and harmonization
of agreements, promote good practices, bring down cross-border interconnections costs
and promote connections to the RIXPs. An assessment on the international
interconnection pricing has commenced. Inventory on the hosting and type of Root
Domain Name System (DNS) Servers instances in SADC region has shown that all
Member States, except Comoros, Kingdom of Eswatini and Zambia have at least one
Root DNS Server instance.
SADC Roaming Project
The SADC Roaming Project targets the development of policy and regulatory frameworks
for the provision of transparent and affordable mobile roaming tariffs for voice, SMS and
data services within the SADC region. Thus, contributing towards making the region more
competitive. The Project is being implemented in three phases. Phases 1 on
31

-----------------------Page 31 End-----------------------

Liberalisation, Transparency to roaming tariff, Information and Data Collection; and Phase
2 on Wholesale and Retail Price Cap Regulation: Roam Like At Home (RLAH) have been
completed by Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) from ten (10) Member States
(Botswana, Kingdom of Eswatini, Malawi, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa,
United Republic of Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe). This has brought about
transparency on Roaming Services through the reception of an SMS upon entry of a
roamer into a foreign network and reduction in tariffs through price cap regulation for both
wholesale and retail roaming prices, in line with the SADC Roaming Glide Paths. As part
of Phase 3 on Cost-based Roaming Price Regulation, the SADC Roaming Cost Model
was developed to determine the wholesale and retail tariff ceilings for various roaming
types of calls, SMS and data services. The analysis and calculations were completed and
approved by SADC ICT Ministers in September 2019. A critical and essential element
policy and regulatory requirement will be for Member States to review their appropriate
regulations to allow for harmonisation of International Termination Rates (ITRs) in the
region.
SADC Harmonized Cyber Security Legal and Regulatory Framework
An assessment was completed in November 2019 on the transposition on SADC Model
Law on Data Protection in SADC Member States and gap analysis. All SADC Member
States have either transposed the SADC Harmonised Cyber Security Model Laws or have
a cyber-security legal framework in place. Member States are setting up National and
Regional (Computer Incident Response Team) CIRT to institutionalise the SADC
Harmonised Cyber Security Legal and Regulatory Framework.
Under the International Multilateral Partnership Against Cyber Threats (IMPACT)
initiative, six (6) Member States (Botswana, Kingdom of Eswatini, Mauritius, South Africa,
United Republic of Tanzania and Zambia) have established and operationalized their
National CIRTs. Six (6) Member States (Angola, Democratic Republic of Congo, Lesotho,
Mozambique, Namibia and Zimbabwe) have completed the International
Telecommunication Union (ITU) CIRT Assessment and are awaiting the enactment of
appropriate legislation to operationalise their National CIRT. The process is currently
ongoing for further two (2) Member States (Madagascar and Seychelles).
All SADC Member States plan to have an operational CIRT by end of 2020. SADC plans
to establish a Regional CIRT that will enhance Regional, continental and internal cooperation on cybersecurity, facilitate capacity building and information and technology
sharing. The Framework for Setting up the SADC Regional CIRT was approved by the
SADC ICT Ministers in September 2019 and a call has been made to Member States to
submit Expressions of Interest (EOI) for hosting the SADC Regional CIRT.

-----------------------Page 32 End-----------------------

SADC Participation in the World Radiocommunications Conference (WRC)
The World Radiocommunication Conference 2019 (WRC-19) was convened in November
2019 in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt. SADC developed common positions in all 32 WRC-19
Agenda Items and formulated six (6) proposals as agenda items for WRC-23. SADC
strategically reinforced its Common Position and Proposals with the support from EACO
Members, forming a common group proposal for a total of 20 Africa Member States. The
WRC-19 outcomes were favorable to the SADC region.
Framework for SADC Shared Satellite Programme
The Framework for SADC Shared Satellite Programme was developed to enable the
development of a SADC Regional Shared Satellite Programme that harnesses the
potential of the satellite technology; to provide satellite communication services and
products; and to fulfil the economic, political, social and environmental needs of SADC.
Central to the implementation of the framework is the aspect of addressing the regional
expertise in satellite communications technology. In addition, capacity building was
conducted in January 2020 to satellite Experts in the region on ITU satellite software,
Radio Regulation (RR) and Rules and Procedure (RoP) on Satellite Networks. The
training enabled Member States to develop new satellite filings for national Broadcasting
Satellite Service (BSS) in the ITU planned bands (Appendix 30/30A) to replace their
degraded assignments in pursuance of the special procedure stipulated in ITU Resolution
559 (WRC-19). To date, over 100 Satellite Experts from the regional have been mentored.
SADC Postal Strategy (2017-2020)
The SADC Postal Strategy (SPS) is the region’s strategic reference document for the
development of its postal sector. The Strategy identifies four strategic thrusts that are
directly linked to the Digital SADC 2027 infrastructure objectives and also well aligned
with the strategic priorities of the African continent under the Universal Postal Union
(UPU) Istanbul World Postal Strategy, which are Ecommerce and Socio-economic
inclusion. Significant progress has been recorded in the implementation of the Strategy
as follows:
(i)

Regional Quality of Service (QOS) Improvement: The SADC Postal Quality
of Service (QoS) Monitoring Project using the Global Monitoring System
(GMS) infrastructure has been successfully initiated in six (6) Member States
(Botswana, Kingdom of Eswatini, Lesotho, Malawi, Namibia and Zimbabwe) to
measure the quality of intra-regional postal traffic with the diagnostic capability
to identify, report and resolve delays.

(ii)

Operational Readiness for E-commerce (ORE): The Operational Readiness
for E-commerce (ORE) which commenced in May 2017 aims to assess and
strengthen the capacity and operational efficiency in the supply chain of the

33

-----------------------Page 33 End-----------------------

Designated Postal Operators (DPOs) to support the development of ecommerce. All SADC Member States are participating in the ORE Project.
DPOs have developed National Country Roadmaps and National Action Plans
which highlight the key milestones each operator has to achieve in the ORE
Project. In addition, DPOs in Botswana, South Africa and Zimbabwe have
successfully developed and deployed ecommerce platforms and applications.
This trend is expected to continue following the ORE project.
(iii)

SADC Postal E-commerce and Trade Facilitation Guidelines: SADC
Postal E-commerce and Trade Facilitation Guidelines have been developed to
guide SADC Member States in providing appropriate and proportionate
regulatory oversight to stimulate intra-regional e-commerce and trade through
the regional postal and courier services network. The guidelines will promote
a common regional understanding of the regulatory considerations that are
relevant to the Postal e-commerce and provide guidance to NRAs on
harmonised regional approaches to dealing with the specific regulatory issues
in the e-commerce and trade facilitation environment.

(iv) SADC Universal Postal Service and Access Guidelines: DPOs have a
Universal Service Obligation (USO) to guarantee availability of a specific mix
of postal products and services to SADC citizens regardless of their
geographic location and socio-economic status. USO is a critical matter for the
financial performance of DPOs, as it relates to affordability, accessibility and
QOS of postal services. In pursuit for regional harmonisation and the changing
postal landscape, an assessment on the commercial sustainability of DPOs in
relation to their USOs was conducted and this led to the development of the
SADC Universal Postal Service and Access Guidelines, approved in
September 2019.
(v)

Awareness on GBV: GBV information, education and communication (IEC)
materials were developed in all the 3 SADC languages under the campaign
message of "SADC United to End GBV" to raise awareness on GBV. In
addition, posters and pamphlets to highlight the status of GBV in the region
and the SADC GBV Strategy were produced and shared with Member States
and stakeholders through different platforms.

3.2.2 ENERGY
The energy sector operational plan for 2019/2020 was anchored to the Energy Sector
Plan (ESP) of Regional Infrastructure Development Master Plan (RIDMP), which was the

34

-----------------------Page 34 End-----------------------

basis for energy sector targets in the Revised Regional Indicative Strategic Development
Plan (RISDP) 2015-2020 as follows:
Implementation of SADC Renewable Energy Strategy and Action Plan
The Secretariat continued to monitor implementation of the Renewable Energy and
Energy Efficiency Strategy and Action Plan (REEESAP) that was approved by Ministers
responsible for Energy in July 2017. The aim of the Plan is to increase uptake of
renewable energy and promotion of energy efficiency in all sectors of economy.
The Regional Energy Access Strategy and Action Plan (REASAP) of 2010 was revised.
The Plan aims to provide a vision and direction to move Member States towards universal
energy access, with a midway goal to halve the number of people without access to
electricity and modern energy resources by the year 2020. The revised REASAP is
aligned to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal number 7 on increasing
access to energy, sustainable utilisation of renewable energy and promotion of energy
efficiency as well as adoption of Multi-Tier (Tier 0 - Tier 5) Framework developed by the
World Bank characterised, among others, by universal access to reliable, affordable,
convenient and safe electricity.

Expansion of Electricity Generation and Transmission Capacity
The Region was able to commission 3,595 Megawatts (MW) contributed by Angola,
Democratic Republic of Congo, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa and
Tanzania. The commissioned capacity is about 90% of the targeted capacity of 4,000
MW. When considering the current peak demand and generation capacity reserve
margins, the Region has a deficit of 1,904 MW. The deficit emerged as a result of reduced
operating capacity due to planned and unplanned maintenance in large power plants in
the Region during 2019/2020 financial year. The regional generation mix is still dominated
by coal at 60% and hydro at 21% while other primary sources such as gas and renewable
energies are gradually increasing. In order to enhance security of energy supply, the
Secretariat with support from Development Bank of Southern Africa (DBSA) is developing
the Regional Gas Master Plan (RGMP).
Establishment and Strengthening of Regional Centres of Excellence for Research and
Training in the Energy Sector
The Secretariat secured signing of Inter-Governmental Memorandum of Agreement
(IGMoA) by 10 Member States (Angola, Botswana, Kingdom of Eswatini, Lesotho,
Malawi, Mauritius, Namibia, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe) on the operationalisation
of the SADC Centre for Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency (SACREEE). In terms
of institutional and programmatic sub-activities, SACREEE also received support from a

35

-----------------------Page 35 End-----------------------

number of International Cooperating Partners (ICPs) on soft infrastructure development
and technical assistance such as:
(i)

the Austrian Development Agency through UNIDO on recruitment of Executive
Director of SACREEE;

(ii)

development of the SADC Industrial Energy Efficiency Programme (SIEEP)
supported by EU;

(iii)

support of small-scale renewable energy entrepreneurs on skills development
supported by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA)

(iv) Energy Efficient Lighting and Appliance (EELA) programme supported by
Swedish International Development and Cooperation Agency (Sida). The
immediate target for EELA project is to develop Minimum Energy Performance
Standards (MEPS) for the electrical appliances and equipment in the Region.
The assessment of sustainability of Kafue Gorge Training Centre (KGRTC) based in
Kafue Gorge, Zambia was completed for clearance by Ministers responsible for Energy
and subsequently for consideration and approval by Council of Ministers. KGRTC offers
short-term training on energy courses, research and development services and hire-out
conference facilities to sustain its operations. KGRTC also receives support from the
Government of Zambia as part host Country obligation through the national power Utility
ZESCO under the Ministry of Energy.
To
Development of Regional Energy Sector-Wide Regulatory Framework
The Market and Investment Framework for SADC Power Projects was approved by the
Ministers responsible for Energy as an instrument to guide investors who want to venture
into power generation and transmission projects and to enhance investments in power
projects in the region. With the support from the Project on Enhancing of a Sustainable
Regional Energy Market (ESREM) for Eastern Africa, Southern Africa and Indian Ocean
(EA-SA-IO), the Secretariat undertook a study on strengthening of Regional Energy
Regulators Association (RERA) of Southern Africa into Regional Energy Regulatory
Authority to oversee and regulate cross-border power trading and the operations of the
competitive electricity market under supervision of SAPP. ESREM is also supporting the
EA-SA-IO region on development of a regional Framework for Regulatory Oversight for
the Energy Market.
Migration to Electricity Cost Reflective Tariffs
Member States continued to offer government guarantees for power projects and
implementing the tariff adjustments to enable the power utilities to be able to fully recover
costs of electricity supply. Presently, Namibia, Kingdom of Eswatini and Mauritius have

36

-----------------------Page 36 End-----------------------

migrated to cost-reflective tariffs while Angola, Lesotho, Mozambique, South Africa,
Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe have lifeline tariff structures that allow for a minimum
level of service. In preparation to migrate into cost reflective tariffs, 10 Member States
(Kingdom of Eswatini, Mauritius, Namibia, Angola, Lesotho, Mozambique, South Africa,
Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe) completed the Cost of Service Studies (COSS) as part
of implementation of the decisions by the Ministers responsible for Energy in May 2019.
3.2.3 TRANSPORT
The Tripartite Transport & Transit Facilitation Programme (TTTFP) Programme has
developed a number of Policy, regulatory and strategic frameworks documents which
were approved by Ministers of Transport in October 2019 to enhance efficient cross
border road transport and transit networks in the Tripartite region. These include policy
decisions relating to phasing out of the Left-Hand Drive Vehicles in Member States
Driving on the Left Side of the Road; ToRs for Development of the SADC Regional
Railway Infrastructure Development Master Plan; and the SADC Regional Railway
Emergency Response Charter. Harmonization of these instruments is critical for
development of regional infrastructures and promotion of economic development, trade
and investment.
The model laws and regulations to facilitate the domestication of the Multilateral Cross
Border Road Transport Agreement (MCBRTA) were approved by the Tripartite Ministers
responsible for Infrastructure in October 2018. At least eight (8) countries (Angola,
Ethiopia, Kenya, Lesotho, Namibia, Rwanda, Tanzania (including Zanzibar), and
Uganda) are at different stages of changing existing laws based on the Model Laws.
Implementation of the MCBRTA will facilitate reduction in transport costs and transit times
for people and goods in the Member States.
The Vehicle Load Management Agreement (VLMA), Road Transport Model Laws, Model
Regulations and Standards were approved by the Tripartite Sectoral Committee of
Ministers of Infrastructure ready for consideration by the Tripartite Summit. In terms of the
corridors, the Governance Instruments for Lobito and Maputo Development Corridors
were developed. Those for Beira and North South Corridors were open for signature by
Corridor States. Harmonisation of road transport policies, laws, regulations and standards
enhances efficient cross border road transport and transit networks in the Tripartite
region.
3.2.4 WATER
Kunene Transboundary Water Supply Project (Angola and Namibia)
The Kunene Transboundary Water Supply Project (KTWSP), a joint project between
Angola and Namibia, aimed at increasing the assurance of supply to the two countries for
drinking, agriculture and industrial development for the communities and towns of
Southern Angola and Northern Namibia. The project had two major components namely:
37

-----------------------Page 37 End-----------------------

Calueque-Oshakati trans-border pipeline and canal repair works, and water supply
system to the Calueque Village in Angola (Lot 1); and Angolan Santa Clara town water
supply system construction works (Lot 2). In this regard, the Secretariat achieved the
following milestones:
(i)

The Lot 1 activities saw the delivery of a new water treatment plant, pipeline
and canal repair works, construction of abstraction points (24) for livestock
watering and irrigation abstraction, and a new water distribution network for
Calueque village, which has resulted to over 330 households provided with
clean and reliable water supply. The water transfer canal and pipeline repair
works have ensured reduced system losses for the water being transferred
across the border into Namibia.

(ii)

The Lot 2 activities, which are also completed, have ensured the provision of
improved assurance of potable water supply to the Santa Clara community in
this border town. This component included construction of water tanks and a
huge water supply reticulation network to provide potable water supply in the
Santa Clara village that had an acute problem of shortage of water supply. The
project is serving approximately 200,000 inhabitants overall.

Groundwater Management Programme
Groundwater continues to be relevant and important for alleviating poverty through
improving human well beings, livelihoods, food production, ecosystems, industries and
growing cities in the SADC region. It is estimated that over 70% of the 250 million people
living in the SADC region rely on groundwater as their primary source of water. In that
regards, SADC Secretariat continued to implement groundwater management
programmes through SADC-Groundwater Management Institution (SADC-GMI). So far,
51 Young Professionals from the Member States went through internship programmes
relating to Data Collection and Management as well as the expansion of the SADC
Groundwater Information Portal. To strengthen Member States Institutional Frameworks
for Sustainable Groundwater Management, the followings were achieved:
(iii)

Delivered eight (08) out of ten (10) required trainings dedicated to providing
guidance to stakeholders on identifying solutions for strengthening legal,
policy, and regulatory tools (by December 2020); and

(iv) Out of the targeted 120 people by December 2020, 118 people received
training dedicated to groundwater data collection, management and sharing.
Furthermore, Transboundary Aquifers (TBA) in the SADC region were completed in July
2019 for the Shire TBA shared by Malawi and Mozambique. Work is ongoing in
partnership with the International Water Management Institute (IWMI) in the Tuli-Karoo
TBA shared between Botswana, RSA and Zimbabwe. Further work on the Eastern
Kalahari TBA shared between Botswana and Zimbabwe is also at procurement stage.
38

-----------------------Page 38 End-----------------------

The Secretariat completed five (5) research studies to date on dealing with the
groundwater management challenges in the Member States, namely Deep Aquifer
exploration, Groundwater Infrastructure Operation and Maintenance, Groundwater
Resilience, Groundwater Data Collection and Management, and Conjunctive Water
Management.
The Secretariat is also implementing small sub-grant Groundwater infrastructure projects
in Member States under the Project funded through the World Bank support. By end of
March 2020, 2 out of the 15 targeted sub-grant pilot projects to be implemented in the
SADC Member States were completed in Malawi and Botswana. Three other projects in
Zimbabwe (implemented in Limpopo basin by World Vision), Zambia and in Kingdom of
Eswatini are more than 80% complete. Seven additional projects in Angola, Lesotho,
Mozambique, Namibia, Tanzania and Zimbabwe are at less than 50% completion rate
mainly due to implementation delays caused by lengthy government procurement
processes. By December 2020, an estimated 25,300 beneficiaries from the interventions
were recorded against the initially targeted 3,000 direct beneficiaries. In addition, 33
people have learned applied skills from the demonstration groundwater pilot projects out
of the targeted 60 people by December 2020.
Climate Resilient Infrastructure Development (CRIDF) Facility Projects
The CRIDF programme continued to implement a number of projects in the Region. In
the current second phase, the Mitema water supply scheme was completed in Tanzania.
The scheme has delivered the rehabilitation of the Mitema Water Treatment Plant and
distribution pipework to ensure clean and reliable water supply to the Makonde Plateau
community with a population of 408,000. Several schemes were also constructed in the
Eastern Limpopo in Zimbabwe, providing potable water supply, small-scale irrigation,
livestock watering and other livelihood projects. In Maseru (Lesotho), a water Demand
Management project was completed and benefited 3500 households with a population of
21000 by improving water pressures management. In Mchinji (Malawi), a Water Supply
and Sanitation Scheme was installed at the Zambia/Malawi border which benefited 324
households with a population of 1,944. In Namibia, a livelihoods project is being
constructed to provide water supply, irrigation, and to help the community with 52
households maintain their livestock.
3.2.5 METEOROLOGY
The interventions under Meteorology aim to improve the meteorological infrastructure that
are fully integrated, efficient, and cost effective to meet the requirements of the users,
and to minimize adverse effects of severe weather and climate phenomena by the uptake
of weather and climate information services for development planning. During 2019/20
the following were achieved.

39

-----------------------Page 39 End-----------------------

Member States have enhanced skills to produce, analyze and disseminate Climate
Information and data
Through the Southern African Regional Climate Services for Disaster Resilience
(SARCIS-DR) Project, a number of meteorological equipment were deployed to Member
States including 40 Automatic Weather Stations, 14 High Performance Computing
servers and 2 Automatic message switching system. Once delivered and installed, the
meteorological equipment will improve the capacity of National Meteorological and
Hydrological Services on access processing and monitoring of the weather- and climaterelated data and systems for timely early warning and disaster mitigation.
Figure 11: Development of equipment (AWS, HPC and AMSS) to Member States

In addition, the Project conducted a series of capacity building activities to about 80
experts from various climate sensitive sectors in early warning at national and regional
levels. These included, seasonal climate forecasting technique, administration of HighPerformance Computing servers, Climate risk assessment, Meso-scale forecasting for
extreme weather event (Numerical Weather Prediction) and Climate modelling.
SADC Climate Services Centre (CSC) fully operational
The SADC Climate Services Centre is a Centre of Excellence of the Secretariat to
implement the mission of the Meteorology Programme in SADC. In this regard, it provides
operational, regional climate services for monitoring and predicting all facets of seasonal
climate conditions, including extreme conditions. The CSC plays a vital role in climate
information and prediction services through the Southern African Climate Outlook Forum
(SARCOF) processes.
In 2019/20, the SARCIS-DR Project funded two (2) annual Southern African Climate
Outlook Forum (SARCOF). The forum brought together and interacted with experts from
various climate sensitive sectors to uptake seasonal climate forecasts for rainfall season
and early warning advisories based on consensus regional forecasts generated by
climate experts from Member States. The SARCOF advisories aim to guide strategic
planning to climate sensitive sectors and enhanced preparedness & response to

40

-----------------------Page 40 End-----------------------

imminent hazards. In addition, the CSC issued the SARCOF statements, extreme
weather alerts and drought advisories to Member States.
In achieving the effective integration of regional early warning, the SARCIS-DR project
also capacitated the SADC CSC to use its HPC Cluster for Generation and dissemination
of extreme weather and climate information services for disaster risk reduction. In this
regard, the SADC CSC generated and uploaded daily, weekly and monthly weather and
climate information on its website (http://csc.sadc.int/) for use by the different
stakeholders in the Region.

PEACE AND SECURITY COOPERATION

3.3.1 CONFLICT PREVENTION, MANAGEMENT AND RESOLUTION
The security situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo continued to be characterized
by escalating violence, rebel attacks, the re-emergence of the Ebola outbreak and the
deteriorating situation in the eastern part of the country, particularly in the Ituri and North
Kivu provinces. The region has remained seized with the developments in the country
through the SADC Liaison Office and the on-going efforts of the Force Intervention
Brigade (FIB) under the mandate of MONUSCO. Despite several attempts for
engagement, the United Nations (UN) has unilaterally decided to replace one FIB
battalion with a composite battalion to include non-SADC countries, a situation which may
undermine the operational effectiveness and unity of command and control of the FIB.
Additionally, we register with concern the recurrent delays on the deployment of the
intelligence capabilities such as, Geo-Location and Threat Analysis Unit (GTAU) and
Tactical Intelligence Unit (TIU) to enhance combat capabilities of FIB battalions.
In the Kingdom of Lesotho, the political and security situation remained fragile and
unpredictable, as the country continued to grapple with the infighting in the ruling All
Basotho Convention (ABC) party, led to the collapse of the coalition government. The
Prime Minister Dr. Motsoahae Thomas Thabane was replaced by the former Minister of
Finance, Dr. Moeketsi Majoro who was sworn-in as the incoming Prime Minister 20th May
2020, leading a coalition Government of which the ABC and the Democratic Congress
(DC) are the major partners. Notwithstanding the political issues, the Government of
Lesotho and other national stakeholders conducted the National Leaders Forum (NLF)
and Plenary II Multi-Stakeholder National Dialogue which established the National
Reforms Authority (NRA) to spearhead the pending comprehensive national reforms. The
SADC Facilitator remains engaged with the process of assisting the country to implement
the reforms process.
In efforts to bring long-lasting peace and security in the Republic of Mozambique, a
landmark agreement on peace and reconciliation was signed between the Government
of Mozambique and RENAMO in August 2019. This was followed by general elections
which were conducted in a peaceful manner in October 2019. These gains have been

41

-----------------------Page 41 End-----------------------

affected by incidents of terrorism and armed attacks in the Cabo Delgado Province of the
Republic of Mozambique. Given the intensification of the armed attacks particularly
against the civilian population and the destruction of infrastructure, SADC is working with
Government of Mozambique for the neutralization of insurgency in the province and to
prevent its activities from spreading into the Region.
As part of the of the regional strategic priority to prevent, contain and resolve inter and
intra state conflict by peaceful means, the Secretariat enhanced the capacity of Member
States National Infrastructures for Peace (I4P) aimed at strengthening SADC's
deployment capability for mediation and conflict resolution. In that regard, a Database of
mediation practitioners for easy access to the pool of qualified Mediators was established.
3.3.2 STRENGTHENING REGIONAL COLLECTIVE DEFENCE AND SECURITY
In a bid to increase and strengthen public security and safety in the region, the following
key instruments were adopted: the Refugees and Asylum Seekers Management Policy
Framework which promotes sound management of Refugees and Asylum Seekers; the
Protocol on Interstate Transfer of Foreign Prisoners that guide cooperation between
Member States in transferring Sentences Prisoners and a Prison/Corrections/
Penitentiary Services; and the Guidelines for Basic Training for Corrections/Prisons in
order to harmonise training for new entrants and equip them with the requisite knowledge,
skills and abilities.
SADC continued to work on efforts to strengthen capacity of Member States to combat
and eradicate the illicit proliferation, circulation and trafficking of small arms and light
weapons in the region. The SADC Protocol on the Control of Firearms, Ammunition and
other related materials was reviewed to align it with the international conventions and
incorporate contemporary best practices and standards for prevention and combating
illicit proliferation, circulation and trafficking of firearms, ammunitions and related
materials.
3.3.3 DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS AND PRACTICES IN THE REGION
In line with Member States national constitutions and the Principles and Guidelines
Governing Democratic Elections, seven (07) Member States (South Africa, Malawi,
Madagascar, Mozambique, Botswana, Namibia and Mauritius) conducted successful
elections. The Secretariat facilitated the deployment of the SADC Electoral Observer
Missions supported by the SADC Electoral Advisory Council (SEAC). The deployments
of SEOM also involved the strengthening of the capacity of election observers in among
others, the application of information communication technologies in the process of
election observation.
The Secretariat enhanced the capacity of Member States National Infrastructures for
Peace (I4P) to strengthen SADC's deployment capability for mediation and management

42

-----------------------Page 42 End-----------------------

of conflicts. In that regard, a Database of mediation practitioners for easy access to the
pool of qualified Mediators was established.

3.4

SPECIAL PROGRAMMES OF REGIONAL DIMENSION

3.4.1 AGRICULTURE, FOOD SECURITY AND NATURAL RESOURCES
Regional Agricultural Policy
The SADC Region Biennial Report on the implementation of Malabo Declaration
Commitments/Targets was developed using inputs from the Member States. The African
Union Commission further released the second Biennial Review Report (2019) on Malabo
commitments in February 2020 at the African Union Summit, in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.
The report indicates that the average score for the SADC Region is at 4.27 against a
benchmark score of 6.66 for 2019, based on submissions from twelve SADC Member
States (Angola, Botswana, Kingdom of Eswatini, Lesotho, Madagascar, Malawi,
Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Zambia and Zimbabwe). The analysis
indicates that the region is not on-track in meeting the CAADP/ Malabo commitments. At
individual Member State level, the review also shows that no SADC country is on-track,
representing a 66.7% decline from the number of countries that were on-track in the
inaugural 2017 Biennial Review.
The Regional Food Security Situation
Rainfall during the 2019/2020 season was erratic in most parts of the region. During the
first half of the season, from October to December 2019, well below average rainfall was
received in central and southern parts of the region, resulting in delayed onset, reduced
area planted, poor germination and crop establishment. In some parts of the central
areas, the October to December rainfall was the lowest since 1981 (38 years ago). In the
second half of the season, January to March 2020, good rains were received in most
parts of the Region, including parts of Angola, Democratic Republic of Congo,
Madagascar, Malawi, Mozambique, Tanzania and Zambia resulting in excessive rains
and flooding in several areas.
The poor seasonal rainfall distribution negatively affected harvest prospects in many
southern parts of the region while excessive rains caused flooding which resulted in loss
of lives, displacement of populations, destruction of infrastructure and washing away of
crops in north-eastern parts of the region. The generally high rainfall in the second half of
the season was beneficial for cropping although a four-week dry spell starting in late
February in central and eastern parts of the Region marked an early cessation of the
rainfall season. The premature end of rains caused wilting of much of the late-planted
crops, dampening good harvest prospects, which had been brought by the favorable
January and February rainfall.

43

-----------------------Page 43 End-----------------------

Due to the drought conditions experienced in some parts of the Region, pasture and water
availability was negatively impacted resulting with some Member States including
Botswana, Kingdom of Eswatini, Lesotho and Namibia introducing subsidies for livestock
feeds and veterinary medicines. Botswana also allowed temporary export of live cattle,
with 26,848 cattle exported to Namibia and South Africa.
Food and Nutrition Security Strategy
The Annual Food Balance Sheets was produced in close collaboration with Member
States, using Integrated Phase Classification (ICP) Protocols. Guidance document on
nutrition information was produced with country specific case studies to ensure that
Member States are capacitated in crop production and monitoring systems, and align and
standardize food and nutrition security assessment methodologies for National Early
Warning Units.
The Secretariat supported the integration of Guidelines on Urban and on Nutrition and
HIV-AIDS into Vulnerability Assessments. The aim is to ensure that the Regional Early
Warning Systems and Vulnerability Assessment Systems are efficiently domesticated in
all the Member States. A complete and functional National Early Warning System entails
Agromet, Agricultural Economics, and Agricultural Statistical systems. By end of March
2020, eight Member States had existing and functional National Early Warning Systems
in place (Botswana, Democratic Republic of Congo, Malawi, Mozambique, South Africa,
Tanzania, Zambia, Zimbabwe). The remaining eight Member States either do not have
the Systems in place or that the System exists but one of the three aspects is not fully
functional. Member States without National Early Warning Units have been engaged to
evaluate the needs for development of Early Warning System.
Agricultural Input Supply
The SADC Seed Centre Sustainability Plan and the Guidelines for Seed Certification and
Quality Assurance were developed and approved by the Ministers responsible for
Agriculture and Food Security in Windhoek, Namibia, in June 2019. The aim was to
improve agriculture production, productivity and competitiveness in the Region. This
forms part of the implementation of the Harmonized Seed Regulatory System (HSRS) by
the Members State to ensure accessibility of good quality seed throughout the region.
The SADC Secretariat in collaboration with USAID Seed Trade Project and the
Government of Zambia piloted seed production with the SADC registered maize varieties
in Lusaka, Zambia using the principles outlined in the HSRS. The pilot produced over two
hundred metric tons of hybrid maize seed that were commissioned and exported to
Democratic Republic of Congo bearing the SADC Seed Label. The pilot also provided
valuable lessons as it facilitated testing of the Guidelines for Seed Certification and
Quality Assurance. The Guidelines were used to conduct field inspections with
involvement of National Seed Authorities representatives from Democratic Republic of

44

-----------------------Page 44 End-----------------------

Congo, Malawi, Mozambique, Zambia and Zimbabwe and lessons were shared with all
Member States. The guidelines were found to be useful in facilitating harmonized field
inspections to ensure uniform approach by all Member States.
The Regional Strategy on Conservation and Utilization of Animal Genetic Resources
(AnGR) was developed and validated by Member States to ensure improved agricultural
production and maintenance of species diversity for present and future generations. The
Strategy aims to:
(i)

address key factors threatening AnGR and the dynamics of the threats; and
how to mitigate them;

(ii)

harmonize the regional AnGR conservation and utilization strategies;

(iii)

initiate implementation of collaboration mechanisms including joint research
projects and cross border businesses;

(iv) improve the institutional capacity for AnGR conservation and sustainable
utilization in SADC Region;
(v)

review and improve existing policies and institutional; arrangements to ensure
sustainable use and conservation of AnGR in SADC Region;

(vi) enhance resource mobilization for supporting AnGR activities; and
(vii) develop monitoring and evaluation framework of the strategies for
conservation and utilization of AnGR in SADC Region.
Surveillance and Control of Transboundary Plant and Animal Diseases and Pests
The Regional Strategy on Plant Health and Guidelines for Pesticides Management and
Risk Reduction was approved by Ministers responsible for Agriculture and Food Security
in June 2019. The Guidelines will contribute to the implementation of the Integrated Pest
Management and minimize the use of highly hazardous pesticides. The guidelines further
aim to achieve harmonized regime for registration of pesticides that includes evaluation
procedures, standards, mutual recognition and equivalence in the region to safeguard
both animal and human health and environment; and establish harmonized pesticides
classification systems according to Globally Harmonized System of classification and
labelling of chemicals.
The Anti-Microbial Resistance (AMR) Framework and Dog-Mediated human rabies
Strategy were developed and validated by the Member States, as part of development
and implementation of Strategies for surveillance and control of transboundary animal
pests and diseases by the Member States. The aim is to support Member states to
address AMR and eliminate human rabies deaths and other related challenges.
A steady progress has been made towards building capacity of Member States in the
management of the six crops pests and disease (Fall armyworm, Tuta Absoluta, Banana
45

-----------------------Page 45 End-----------------------

Bunchy Top Virus, Fusarium Oxysporum TR4, Lethal Maize Necrosis Disease and
Mediterranean fruitfly (Bartrocera spp) under the EDF 11 project. A total of 74 plant
protection officers were upgraded for identification, understanding of the biology, impact
assessment and management/control strategies of these pests. The aim is to improve
food security and market access in the region. A framework for regional pest specific
management strategies for the six pests was also developed to guide the development
of Regional Management strategies for domestication at national levels.
Joint Management of Transboundary Natural Resources (Fisheries, Forestry, Wildlife and
Transfrontier Conservation Areas)
The Secretariat facilitated the development and approval of Regional Common Position
for Convention on International Trade on Endangered Species (CITES) COP 18 by the
Member States. The SADC Common position was used to guide Member States
engagement in the meeting of the parties, held 17-28 August 2019 in Geneva,
Switzerland, and ensured they speak in one voice. Fifteen SADC Member States
attended CITES COP 18.
Member States were supported on implementation of the SADC Project on conservation
and sustainable management of forest resources which consisted of capacity building
actions addressing Forest Information System, Forest Fire Management and
Participatory Forest Management; and the development of the respective Regional
Guidelines. Guidelines on community engagement in SADC TFCAs and on establishment
of cross-border tourism products were also developed and validated by the Member
States through the SADC statutory structures as part of implementation of Transfrontier
Conservation Area (TFCA) Programme.
The Secretariat also engaged with all Member States on the SADC Monitoring, Control
and Surveillance Coordinating Center (MCSCC) Charter ratification process, through
visits to several Member States. As a result, Angola ratified the Charter, becoming the
8th Member States to do so, joining Kingdom of Eswatini, Lesotho, Mozambique,
Namibia, South Africa, United Republic of Tanzania and Zambia, and increasing the
conditions for the Charter to enter into force. In addition, the Interim Project Management
Unit (IPMU) to operationalize the SADC Regional Fisheries MCS Coordination Centre
(MCSCC), consisting of two officials, was established. The Unit reviewed the Regional
Plan of Action to Prevent, Deter and Eliminate Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated (IUU)
fishing; and set-up the first phase of the Basecamp platform for information sharing
amongst Member States. Basecamp is used to facilitate cooperation amongst Member
States through information exchange and information sharing to tackle IUU fishing.
As part of the implementation of the SADC Regional Aquaculture Strategy, 12 Member
States (Angola, Lesotho, Madagascar, Malawi, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia,
Seychelles, South Africa, URT, Zambia and Zimbabwe) have implemented national
aquaculture programs, in line with the regional strategy. This resulted in an increase in

46

-----------------------Page 46 End-----------------------

aquaculture production from 92,773 tons reported in 2019, to 100,950 tons reported in
2020. Development and approval of "Guidelines for Aquaculture Management in the
SADC region", was conducted to support sustainable, environmentally and socially
acceptable aquaculture practices in the region. Capacity building programs to support
aquaculture value chains were also conducted through Aquatrans (transformation of
aquaculture in the SADC Region) Regional Trainings.
Environment and Sustainable Development
The SADC Great Green Wall Initiative was finalized and approved by the Ministers in
October 2019 to ensure sustainable development and management of the environment.
The Secretariat also supported the development of the Regional Common Position for
the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) COP 25, as
part of the coordination and facilitation of implementation of Multilateral Environment
Agreements. The position was used during COP 25 to fast track signing and ratification
of the Protocol on the Environment progressed through development and dissemination
of advocacy Policy Briefs.
Conservation of Plant Genetic Resources
The Integrated Crop Wild Relatives (CWRs) Strategy Document was developed whereby,
end of 2019/20, the CWRs list was undertaken in Malawi, Mauritius, South Africa and
Zambia. Also, 36 Community Seed Banks were established to support the collection of
genetic material in seven (7) Member States as follows: Kingdom of Eswatini (1),
Madagascar (9), Malawi (7), Tanzania (2), South Africa (3), Zambia (2), and Zimbabwe
(12); and new National Genebanks were established in Comoros and Seychelles.
Published information material was further disseminated to enhance and promote plant
genetic resources and conservation efforts in the Region. These included 1000 copies of
the SPGRC Annual Report; 1500 plant genetic resources conservation information
brochures; 50 copies of the Genebank Standard Operation Procedures (SOPs); and two
(2) copies of promotional videos on SPGRC operations and on the functioning of the Web
SPGRC Documentation and Information System (SDIS).
3.4.2 SOCIAL AND HUMAN DEVELOPMENT
The Social and Human Development component aims to ensure the availability of
educated, skilled, healthy and productive human resources which remains a fundamental
element for investment promotion, the efficiency, effectiveness and competitiveness of
the region in the global economy, as well as improving the quality of lives of the region’s
population.
Education and Skills Development
The SADC Qualifications Framework (SADC QF) was established with the accompanying
quality assurance guidelines which marked a significant milestone for the Region. The

47

-----------------------Page 47 End-----------------------

SADC QF will serve to enhance mobility of skills, including those of researchers and
students across the region. To date, South Africa and Seychelles have aligned national
qualifications framework to the regional framework while a number of other member
states have reached an advanced stage in the alignment process, including Mauritius
which submitted its Alignment Report for Adjudication during 2019/20. The SADC
Member States continued to provide support to the Secretariat, in the implementation of
the SADC QF activities on a rotational basis in order to augment the capacity of the
Secretariat.
SADC Secretariat, in collaboration with the UNESCO Regional Office for Southern Africa
(ROSA) and the Zambia National Commission for UNESCO, supported and facilitated
peer learning and sharing of experiences on Continuous Professional Development
(CPD) practices and policies, among Member States in order to harmonize teacher
policies and practices. A desk review of the status of teacher CPD in nine Member States
(Botswana, Kingdom of Eswatini, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa,
Zambia and Zimbabwe) was conducted to delineating various approaches to teacher
CPD and for sharing of lessons and experiences. The desk review revealed the following;
(i)

A number of countries do not have a clear CPD Framework while others are
working towards the development of their CPD Framework. In some cases,
member states that have CPD Framework also have the professional board or
council to oversee CPD for teachers including in some cases, the registration
and licensing of professional teachers.

(ii)

The varying approaches to CPD or In-Service Education and Training (INSET)
coordination and management. Member States used both centralized and
decentralized coordination and management by the Ministries responsible for
education.

(iii)

The Decentralized approaches have a greater impact and address teachers’
needs best as they tend to be demand-driven. Zambia uses the decentralized
systems whereas countries such as South Africa and Namibia, have semiautonomous units for coordination and management purposes.

(iv) Funding for CPD and INSET also appears to be quite weak in almost all
Member States. This will require Member States to allocate dedicated budgets
to improve the delivery of quality education.
(v)

There is a weak focus on CPD and INSET in the TVET sector, a sector which
remains critical to ensure skills generation to drive industrialization.

UNESCO Regional Office for Southern Africa (ROSA), in collaboration with the
Secretariat, commissioned a desk review of inclusion of Southern African History in the
School Curricula in all SADC Member States. The aim was to determine the level of
integration and teaching of global citizenship issues and values in primary and secondary
schools; and to delineate if and in which curriculum settings the Southern African
48

-----------------------Page 48 End-----------------------

Liberation History (SALH) is integrated. This review will provide the basis for the
promotion of Global Citizenship Education (GCED) in SADC Member States and to inform
the SADC Regional Working Group on the inclusion of SALH in curricula. The Regional
Working Group to lead this process will be established in 2020.
The second phase of the Care and Support Programme in the Education Sector under
the Future Life Now was implemented, whereby Member States continued to show
commitment to the programme. Advocacy continued to ensure the inclusion of care and
support in education settings in the Member States, to leverage on the importance of care
and support services to the overall educational outcomes and attainment. Nine Member
States (Kingdom of Eswatini; Madagascar: Malawi: Mauritius; Mozambique; Namibia;
South Africa; Zambia; Zimbabwe) attained the inclusion of care and support by end of
March 2020 as a result of continued advocacy. Strategic documents were successfully
developed under the Programme to guide Member States during implementation of
national programmes on Care and Support in the Education sector. These include the
following:
(i)

the Generic Operational School-level Handbook on Care and Support in
Teaching and Learning (CSTL);

(ii)

a framework to guide Member States in developing boys-focused
programming;

(iii)

a desktop review of HIV and SRHR policies and regulatory frameworks within
SADC Member States were developed

(iv) an advocacy brief on learner agency;
(v)

an advocacy video on youth climate change dialogues (YCDs);

(vi) the SADC Child and Youth Participation Framework.
Employment and Labour
The SADC Labour Migration Action Plan (2020-2025) was adopted as part of efforts to
promote skills transfer, as well as matching of labour supply and demand for regional
development and integration. The Plan is in line with Article 19 of the SADC Protocol on
Employment and Labour, which seeks to protect and safeguard the rights and welfare of
migrant workers, to give them better opportunities to contribute to countries of origin and
destination. The Plan is therefore an integral part of measures aimed at the progressive
elimination of obstacles to the free movement of capital and labour, goods and services,
and of the people of the Region generally, in line with Article 5 of the SADC Treaty.
The SADC Guidelines on Portability of Social Security Benefits were adopted to ensure
that workers moving within the SADC region maintain social security rights and benefits
acquired under the jurisdiction of different Member States, including pension benefits and
occupational injury and diseases benefits. The Guidelines also seek to facilitate mutual

49

-----------------------Page 49 End-----------------------

administrative assistance between social security authorities in two or more countries.
Following adoption of the Guidelines in March 2020, five Member States (Kingdom of
Eswatini, Lesotho, Malawi, South Africa and Zimbabwe) committed to pilot
implementation through bilateral arrangements.
The SADC Secretariat and the International Labour Organisation (ILO) jointly conducted
a study of the youth labour markets in the region as part of implementation of the 2016
SADC Youth Employment Promotion Policy Framework. The study revealed that the
SADC Region has a labour force that is very youthful by international comparison, and
that it will continue to remain so for the coming decades. In addition, the study showed
that the average youth unemployment rate (15-24 years) in 2017 was approximately 12
percent, higher than the 7% average for older persons thus revealing that youth are more
likely to be without a job compared to their older counterparts largely due to lack of work
experience.
Despite the relatively low overall unemployment rates for some Member States, there is
a high prevalence of informality in employment in SADC, which is typically associated
with lack of legal and social protection as well as with lower wages when compared with
formal employment. An analysis of working poverty revealed that a large proportion of the
working poor across the SADC region with more than 50% of all working youth and nearly
45% of older workers considered extremely poor using the international poverty line of
US$ 1.90 (PPP). Adding to these concerns is the high proportion of youth not in
employment, education or training (NEET), in excess of 25% across several SADC
countries and even higher for females. The NEETs represent a special category of youth
whose potential for integration in the labour markets is particularly low, as they are
simultaneously not gaining experience or new skills.
While Member States are implementing a number of youth initiatives, these do not always
come at significant scale to absorb the majority of unemployed youths. In combination
with the youth focused initiatives, Member States also should strengthen the integration
of pro-employment policies in development and sectoral growth policies, with greater
emphasis on demand side interventions. Sustained and higher rates of economic growth
will need to be realised to create demand for the abundant labour supply among the youth.
As a follow up to the SADC youth labour markets analysis, the SADC Secretariat is
facilitating the development of interventions to promote active and productive participation
by youth in social, economic and political development processes in the region. The
Secretariat is also working with the ILO towards a youth employment project to increase
the proportion of young men and women in decent employment across the SADC region.
Health and Pharmaceuticals
The Malaria Elimination Framework was developed to provide a platform for the
harmonization of policies, guidelines and protocols for malaria control and elimination in
the SADC region. The framework is also aimed at mobilization of required resources,

50

-----------------------Page 50 End-----------------------

partnerships and collaborations to support Member States in controlling and ultimately
eliminate malaria within their national boundaries. Substantial resources have been
mobilized to support Member States’ implementation of malaria control programmes
through partnerships with the Global Fund (GF), the Roll Back Malaria (RBM), African
Leaders Malaria Alliance (ALMA) and the E8 Initiative. The support has enabled Member
States to record significant progress in the control of malaria, and set the pace for
elimination by the year 2030.
The SADC Member States re-affirmed their commitment to eliminate malaria in the region
in accordance with the SADC Protocol on Health and the SADC malaria Framework.
Member states further committed to additional domestic funding for Malaria elimination to
ensure malaria programmes are adequately funded and national targets are met. From
2018, the domestic funding of Malaria programmes in Member States has increased by
8% on average in the SADC region. While the effort by Member States is commendable,
additional investment in national malaria programmes is needed to compensate the everdecreasing international support.
The 2019/20 SADC Tuberculosis (TB) Report which takes stock of the state of the disease
and progress on TB control in the Region was approved and adopted by SADC Ministers
of Health and those responsible for HIV and AIDS during the annual meeting. The report
is based on the END TB strategy which prioritizes 10 critical indicators to track the
performance of TB programmes in the Region. The Report reveals a decline in TB
incidence rates since 2015 in most countries; stagnation in incidence in few (20%) of the
countries; and significant decline in TB mortality. Almost all Member States achieved the
15% reduction in TB mortality between 2015 and 2018. Six Member States (Angola,
Botswana, Mauritius, Namibia, Seychelles and South Africa) have attained middle
income status and may not continue to qualify for funding from external sources, therefore
there is need for Member States to mobilise domestic resources to meet the national TB
requirements as well as scale up and sustain results.
Nutrition
Development of the regional minimum standards for food fortification was initiated in 2019
as part of implementing programmes that address micronutrient deficiencies. These
standards will provide Member States with guidance to inform the national mandatory
food fortification regulations. Currently there are six (6) Member States (Malawi,
Mozambique, South Africa, United Republic of Tanzania, Lesotho and Zimbabwe) in the
region with mandatory food fortification standards and regulations for cereal flours.
Therefore, adoption of food fortification by the Member States will accelerate the regional
efforts towards addressing micronutrient deficiencies.
The SADC M&E Framework to guide food fortification regulatory monitoring and
enforcement in the Member States was developed through support from the Global
Alliance for Improved Nutrition (GAIN) and UNICEF ESARO. The Framework provides

51

-----------------------Page 51 End-----------------------

guidance on harmonised and systematic approaches to food fortification monitoring and
enforcement. The guidance provides (i) Technical guidance for Member States in food
fortification monitoring and enforcement; (ii) Guidance for tracking regional efforts in
internal and external monitoring; and (iii) Indicators for assessing the outcomes, impact
and progress towards achieving the country nutrition objectives which food fortification
contributes towards.
The regional action framework for improving the quality of young children’s diets was
developed with the aim to activate multi-sectoral national actions from the health, food,
social protection and WASH sectors, to deliver high impact nutrition specific and sensitive
actions that would improve diets of young children. In 2020, the SADC Secretariat in
collaboration with partners will facilitate implementation of the identified nutrition actions
and monitor progress. Partners that are supporting Member States includes UNICEF,
WFP, FAO, WHO and GAIN.
The conceptual framework for youth innovation, entrepreneurship, leadership and
participation was developed and approved by Council of Ministers in August 2019. The
conceptual framework calls for better youth policy alignment, harmonisation and
implementation. While noting that all SADC Member States have youth coordination
structures and institutions, the conceptual framework advocates for strengthening of
these mechanisms particularly in addressing youth innovation and entrepreneurial issues.
On the basis of the approved conceptual framework, the Secretariat is coordinating the
development of a SADC Youth Programme to provide Member States with clear
interventions for the realisation of the demographic dividend.
3.4.3 CROSS–CUTTING PROGRAMMES
Combating the HIV and AIDS Pandemic
The SADC Roadmap for Health and HIV and AIDS Sustained Responses was developed
and approved in June 2019 in Windhoek, Namibia to identify key actions and ensure the
continued progress toward strategic goals for ending AIDS and in the pursuit of Universal
Health Coverage (UHC). The Secretariat also supported and coordinate Member States’
efforts to implement the Roadmap, report progress and share experiences. The
framework will also facilitate the acceleration of the Abuja Declaration Targets wherein
Member States committed to allocating 15% of national budgets to the health sector
across the four pillars which are: Country-led multi-sectoral response – Unwavering
political commitment; Investing for impact and increased efficiencies; Improve and
accelerate “people-centred” integrated delivery that reaches those left behind (HIV and
UHC); and Sustainable multi-sectoral financing for long-term impact.
HIV prevention programmes are yielding positive results as the region continues to record
a sustained downward trend in the number of new HIV infections between 2010 and 2018.
It is also noted that while the number of People living with HIV on Ante Retroviral Therapy

52

-----------------------Page 52 End-----------------------

(ART) continues to constantly increase; four Member States (Botswana, Kingdom of
Eswatini, Namibia and South Africa) reported having less than 5% of infants born to HIVpositive mothers being infected with HIV. Through the realisation that HIV prevention
efforts are lagging behind in some countries in the region, the SADC Secretariat in
collaboration with UNAIDS, UNODC, UNFPA and UNDP undertook technical assistance
to support the four Indian Ocean Countries (Comoros, Madagascar, Mauritius and
Seychelles). Through this support the Member States have documented situational
analyses, and roadmaps for scaling-up HIV prevention and treatment interventions.
The region continues its progress toward ending the AIDS epidemic by 2030. There is a
decline in the number of new HIV infections as demonstrated by Figure 12 as well as an
increase in the People on ART which indicates that countries are investing more on HIV
treatment.

Gender Equality and Development
The Analytical Assessment of Gender Mainstreaming in the SADC Regional Integration
Agenda was developed to provided Member States with updated information on the
status of alignment of national gender policies to the SADC Protocol on Gender and
Development and other gender instruments, the current challenges on women
empowerment, and highlights gaps on gender mainstreaming and recommendations to
Member States to address these gaps. The results of this Assessment were shared with
Member States and will contribute to efforts on strengthening the gender mainstreaming
capacity in the region.
The SADC Regional Multi-Dimensional Women's Economic Empowerment Programme
(RMDWEEP) was approved by the Ministers of Gender and Women's Affairs in May 2019.
This Programme aims to promote implementation of SADC commitments on the
economic empowerment of women by identifying concrete actions at the regional and

53

-----------------------Page 53 End-----------------------

national levels which will accelerate the realization of the benefits of regional integration
and industrialization among both women and men in the region. The Programme is
implemented in accordance with the Industrialization Development. Moreover, the SADC
Secretariat mobilized resources from GIZ to the tune of Euro 2 million to support
implementation of a 3-year regional project on Industrialization and Women’s Economic
Empowerment that seeks to increase the participation of women owned businesses’ and
female entrepreneurs’ in value addition for selected sectors and for regional value chains.
Gender Based Violence
Gender-Based Violence (GBV) continues to be a challenge for the SADC Region in efforts
towards achieving gender equality and promoting peace and security within the regional
integration agenda. Women and girls are disproportionately affected by GBV and
continue to face the brunt of this social scourge. The Secretariat continued to popularize
the SADC Regional Strategy and Framework of Action for Addressing GBV (2018-2030)
and promote its implementation among Member States and regional stakeholders and
partners to address GBV at national and regional levels. The following are the key
milestones achieved during the 2019/2020 period:
a)

The SADC Parliamentary Forum sensitized on the SADC GBV Strategy: The
SADC Parliamentary Forum (SADC-PF) through the Regional Women’s
Parliamentary Caucus (RWPC) was sensitized on the SADC GBV Strategy and
the status of GBV in the region. The Parliamentarians were consulted on issues of
legislative response to GBV, and they further endorsed the development of a
SADC Model Law on GBV to guide national domestication of international and
regional GBV commitments and principles. The process of developing the GBV
Model Law, under the facilitation of the by SADC-PF with support from the SADC
Secretariat, has commenced.

b)

Strengthening of GBV Prevention efforts in SADC Region: The Secretariat
collaborated with GIZ and other regional partners to host a Regional Conference
on Prevention of Violence Against Women in Southern Africa. Key strategies on
what works in prevention of GBV were shared to strengthen GBV prevention efforts
at national level. The Conference, attended by about 200 participants including
representatives from all SADC Member States, provided a platform for
dissemination of the SADC GBV Strategy to partners and other stakeholders
involved in the regional response to GBV. During this Conference, the Secretariat
hosted a side-event to show-case good practices from four Member States
(Botswana, Democratic Republic of Congo, Lesotho and Zimbabwe) on response
and prevention of GBV. The outcome of this Conference will further guide regional
conversations with Member States towards strengthening prevention of GBV in
2020/2021.

54

-----------------------Page 54 End-----------------------

c)

Mapping of Regional Partners Support to the GBV Response: The Secretariat
mapped the partners support to the GBV response through a regional consultative
meeting with GBV partners. The SADC GBV Strategy was disseminated to the
partners to promote its coordinated and effective implementation across the
Region and alignment of the partners’ efforts to this Strategy. The mapping
exercise reflected the active partners in the response to GBV in SADC region, the
extent of technical and financial support by partners, and the type of support
provided by partners to the SADC Member States. The mapping exercise reflected
that all Member States have partners that are already supporting GBV
programmes and projects. The partners further committed to supporting GBV
interventions at national level to align to the SADC GBV Strategy. A regional report
in this regard, also highlighting potential areas of collaboration, has been produced
and shared to Member States to identify partners that support GBV in their
countries. This will guide and contribute to resource mobilization for the GBV
response at national level.

d)

Awareness on GBV: GBV information, education and communication (IEC)
materials were developed in all the 3 SADC languages under the campaign
message of "SADC United to End GBV" to raise awareness on GBV. In addition,
posters and pamphlets to highlight the status of GBV in the region and the SADC
GBV Strategy were produced and shared with Member States and stakeholders
through different platforms.

Science, Technology and Innovation
Improved skills through enhanced Science, Technology, Innovation (STI) and business
sophistication is one area that has been identified as critical in supporting SADC
Industrialisation Strategy. The aim is to strengthen Member States capacity in innovation
capacities, and efficient application of science and technology for industrial development.
This is implemented through the SADC Protocol on Science, Technology and Innovation
(STI), that was adopted in 2008 and came into force in 2017. There has been
considerable progress in the adoption of STI policies in the region as published in the
UNESCO Science Report of 2015. The number of SADC countries that have adopted
STI policies has increased from 11 to 14 out of the 16 Member States. In particular
Mauritius does not have a dedicated STI policy but implements programmes in STI. A
number of Member States in the region that are currently reviewing their STI Policies are
Botswana, Namibia, Tanzania and Malawi.
The Framework and Guidelines for the Establishment of Centres of Excellences (CoEs)
and Centres of Specialisation (CoSs) was approved by Council in August 2018. The
Framework and Guidelines will support the establishment and investment of regional
Centres of Excellence, and Centres of Specialisation in Innovation and Technology
Transfer Programmes in support of Industrialization. A regional scoping and mapping

55

-----------------------Page 55 End-----------------------

study has been commissioned to identify potential regional COEs and COSs to support
value chain development and advance industrial development.
The Report on SADC Investment in Research and Development was endorsed by the
Ministers responsible for Education and Training, and Science, Technology and
Innovation in June 2019. The Report revealed that most SADC Member States report
Gross Expenditure on Research and Development (GERD) as percentage of Gross
Domestic Product (GDP) of less than 1%. Government and private sector funding for STI
is still a major challenge, constraining progress towards increasing research and
development (R&D) investment in several Member States. During the COVID-19
Pandemic period, it became evident that investment in STI is critical to support
development of the necessary vaccines; contact tracing and production of personal
protective equipment. Many Governments globally have also been relying on scientific
evidence to inform public policy responses to fight the spread of the pandemic.
The SADC Charter on establishing the Women in Science, Engineering and Technology
Organisation was signed by additional two Member States, which are the Democratic
Republic of Congo and Mauritius in June 2019; bring the total to nine Member States that
have signed the Charter. A two thirds majority is required for the Charter to enter into
force.

Private Sector
The Industrialization Strategy and Roadmap adopted in 2015, proposes an integrated
strategy for SME development. In this regard, the Secretariat has developed a Regional
Framework for Supplier Development with the special focus on building capacities and
capabilities of SMEs to participate in the implementation of the Industrialization Strategy
and regional value chains.
Regional statistical publications were produced and disseminated including the monthly
harmonized consumer price indices; selected indicators; and the database of social
statistics. On statistical capacity building, the development of an Agricultural Information
Management System (AIMS) started during the year with the objective of providing
respective socio-economic statistics pertaining to the agricultural sector in the region.
The Policy on Strategy Development, Planning, Monitoring, Evaluation and Reporting
(SPMER Policy) was reviewed and approved by Council of Ministers in March 2020. The
Revised Policy emphasises the importance of undertaking strategy development,
planning, monitoring, evaluation and reporting within the long-term policy environment
focusing on, among others, the SADC Vision 2050, the African Union Agenda 2063, and
the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The Policy further guides
formulation of new SADC strategic plans in the post-2020 period and enhancement of the
overall impact of the SADC Regional Programme.

56

-----------------------Page 56 End-----------------------

The Interim Medium Term Strategy (IMTS) was developed and approved by Council of
Ministers in March 2020 to guide priority setting for the two years (2020/21-2021/22). The
IMTS is an interim measure intended to guide the development of Annual Corporate Plans
and make way for the development of the SADC 2050 and RISDP 2020-30 Blueprints.

4.5

INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY

The Secretariat continued to use Information Technology (IT) to ensure effectiveness and
efficiency in delivery of programmes throughout the year. The end of the 2019/20
Financial Year was affected by the COVID-19 pandemic that brought about a shift in the
way organisations conduct operations. In the SADC Secretariat, there was a shift towards
telecommuting where staff had to operate virtually. The Secretariat through the support
of its ICT Unit managed to continuously assist Directorates and Units to operate in the
transitional phase.

to the development of policy briefs on Value Chains. Implementation of the policy briefs
and Development of modalities to establish Tripartite Industrial Implementation
Coordinating Unit is still pending including the identification of existing institutions to serve
as Centres of Excellence, for Tripartite Agro-processing value-chains. Momentum in this
area has been affected by COVID-19 pandemic.

6. DEVELOPMENT COOPERATION AND RESOURCE
MOBILISATION
The Secretariat continued to strengthen cooperation with the International Cooperating
Partners (ICPs) in order to facilitate mobilisation of resources for the implementation of
the priority regional programmes and projects that are aligned with the SADC priorities.
In view of this, several agreements and other legal instruments were concluded with a
number of ICPs, who continued to extend their support both technically and financially.

6.1

SADC – EU COOPERATION

The SADC-EU Cooperation is founded on the ACP-EU Cotonou Partnership Agreement,
a partnership framework for the period 2000-2020 that recognizes equality of partners,
global participation, dialogue and regionalization. The partnership is implemented mainly
through the European Development Fund (EDF). The ACP-EU Cotonou Partnership
Agreement expired in February 2020 and transition measures on a successor Agreement
are to be undertaken until December 2021. Negotiations on a successor Agreement
commenced in September 2018 and the drafting of Regional Protocols (Africa, Caribbean
and Pacific) is on-going. As a follow up on that, the SADC Secretariat engaged the SADC
Committee of Ambassadors in Brussels on 18 September 2019 to get an update on the

62

-----------------------Page 62 End-----------------------

status of negotiations. The Secretariat will continuously follow-up on the negotiations of
the successor Agreement and duly advise on SADC priorities during consultations on the
regional protocols.
During the period under review, SADC and the EU concluded six (6) Contribution
Agreements under the 11th EDF Regional Indicative Programme (Sub-Regional
Envelope) worth Euro 126.8 Million to support regional development interventions on
trade facilitation, industrialization, business environment, policy dialogue, climate
services and climate change. These interventions supplement five other programme
interventions that are already under implementation. They include programmes in support
of regional peace & security, regional agricultural policy, institutional strengthening and
capacity building and transport facilitation.
An evaluation/review of SADC-EU Cooperation (under 10th and 11th EDF financial
cycles) was launched in February 2020 to ensure that the SADC-EU Cooperation remains
focused and impactful to the priorities of both SADC-EU regions. The objective of the
evaluation is to provide an overall independent assessment of the EU’s cooperation
strategy and SADC’s programme results delivery in the SADC region between 2008 and
2020. The review will assess the achievement of results from the formulation and
implementation of selected 11th EDF Regional Indicative Programme (RIP) [SADC SubRegional Envelope] and identify lessons learned and provide recommendations on how
to improve current and future co-operation with an aim of increasing impact.

6.2

SADC-EU POLITICAL DIALOGUE

Political Dialogue is an important pillar in the Cotonou Partnership Agreement, hence it is
a key feature in the SADC-EU Development Cooperation. During the period under review,
a SADC-EU Senior Officials Political Dialogue was held on 17 September 2019 in
Brussels, Republic of Belgium. The Dialogue observed the prevailing sanctions on
Zimbabwe and the accompanying socio-economic implications of the sanctions, and
committed to support the reform agenda pursued Government of Zimbabwe. Both parties
commended the prevailing political stability in the SADC Region and committed to
cooperate in the promotion of political stability and regional security through undertaking
bilateral exchanges on counter-terrorism and maritime security strategies. Finally, both
parties renewed their commitment to cooperate on emerging development issues such
as urbanization, environmental degradation, climate change, natural resources and
wildlife conservation, and committed to undertake robust policy dialogues on these
issues, particularly climate change.

6.3

SADC/GERMANY COOPERATION

The objective of SADC-Germany Cooperation is to enhance SADC's capacity as the main
coordinating body for regional integration in the Region. The last Bilateral Negotiations
on Development Cooperation between the Southern African Development Community
63

-----------------------Page 63 End-----------------------

(SADC) and the Federal Republic of Germany were concluded in November 2019 in
Gaborone, Republic of Botswana.
The Negotiations enabled SADC and Germany to review implementation of on-going
programmes and agree on further areas of cooperation. As a result, a commitment
amounting 30.0 million Euro was made for both technical and financial cooperation in
2019, bringing the total envelop to 40.36 million Euro with the earlier commitments that
was made in 2018.
Through the commitments, SADC-Germany cooperation will continue to support, among
others, Regional Economic Integration (covering also Peace, Security and Good
Governance); Transboundary Water Management; Transboundary Natural Resource
Management and Resilience to Climate Change; and Strengthening National-Regional
Linkages.

6.4

SADC – CHINA COOPERATION

The Framework Agreement on Economy, Trade, Investment and Technical Cooperation
between SADC and the Government of the People’s Republic of China was signed in
October 2019. The objectives of the Framework Agreement are, among others, to
enhance cooperation on areas of mutual interests, in tandem with SADC Strategic
Frameworks outlined in the SADC Industrialisation Strategy (2015-2063), the SADC
Regional Infrastructure Development Master Plan (RIDMP), and the Regional Agricultural
Investment Plan (RAIP) (2017 – 2022) which seeks to implement the SADC Regional

US$100,000 to support the SADC Secretariat on its operational needs, using a
programme approach that shall enable the Secretariat to attend to urgent requirements
and implement programmes and activities that are in line with Council Decisions and
SADC priorities.

6.5

SADC – AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK COOPERATION

SADC and the African Development Bank (AfDB) have a long-standing bilateral
partnership for development, which has produced substantial results in the priority areas
of cooperation at both regional and national level. Since 1998 when the first cooperative
agreement was signed between SADC and AfDB, a number of regional projects have
been implemented, focusing on key components of SADC Regional Integration Agenda,
namely the development and financing of value chains that will drive industrialisation,
development of financing and risk mitigating instruments relevant to SADC countries, and
identifying, prioritising, preparing and financing of the implementation of the SADC
regional infrastructure and economic corridors, (i.e. combination of regional infrastructure
and value chains projects).

64

-----------------------Page 64 End-----------------------

The Multinational Protocol of Agreement between SADC and AfDB was signed in August
2019 to support the implementation of the agreed areas of cooperation, to the tune of
UA1.5 million. The Agreement is an outcome of extensive engagements that SADC and
AfDB had since 2016 to help accelerate SADC Regional Integration Agenda, following
the approval of the SADC Legal Framework to operationalize the SADC Regional
Development Fund (RDF). The agreed area of cooperation is focused on key components
of SADC Regional Integration Agenda, divided in the following work streams:
(i)

Development of SADC Regional Infrastructure Projects;

(ii)

Development of regional value chains in the mining sector;

(iii)

SADC Regional Development Fund and Development of Financial
Instruments; and

(iv) Project Management;
The Multinational Protocol Agreement shall enable implementation of the project
“Sustainable Financing of Regional Infrastructure and Industrial Projects in SADC”, in
accordance with the Bank’s rules and procedures as well as those of SADC, implemented
over 3-year period from August 2019 to May 2021.
Furthermore, the AfDB is supporting SADC through COVID-19 Pandemic Crisis
Response to the tune of UA 6.5 million.

6.6

SADC-WORLD BANK COOPERATION

SADC and the World Bank are working together in a number of mutual areas of interest
including infrastructure, disaster risk management, trade and industrialization, at both
national, regional and tripartite (SADC/COMESA/EAC) levels. As of April, 2020, the World
Bank had a total commitment of US$2.45 billion in the SADC region, with US$46.2 million
support to SADC bodies namely; Southern African Power Pool, Centre for Coordination
of Agriculture Research and Development in Southern Africa (CCARDESA) and support
to other SADC projects. SADC and the World Bank have committed to take forward
regional integration efforts to better deliver on regional economic integration objectives,
as the Bank seeks to align its new three-year Regional Integration Strategy to the SADC
regional priorities in the period running from July 2020 to June 2023.

6.7

SADC – UNITED NATIONS ECONOMIC COMMISSION FOR
AFRICA (ECA) COOPERATION

The United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) was very instrumental in the
review of the RISDP and SIPO and in the formulation of the SADC Industrialisation
Strategy and Roadmap (2015-2063). ECA is also supporting SADC on a number of
activities, such as the Tripartite Free Trade Area negotiations; development of a
framework for the “Harmonisation of Mining Policies, Standards, Legislative and

65

-----------------------Page 65 End-----------------------

Regulatory Framework in Southern Africa”; SADC ICT Strategy Programme; Regional
Forum on Developmental Regionalism, Peace and Economic Transformation in Southern
Africa; Support towards the Post 2020 agenda; and Small and Medium Scale Enterprises
(SME) in the Industrialization Process. SADC and ECA have also collaborated through a
Sub-Regional Coordination Mechanism (SRCM), which was set up as a platform to
increase coherence of ECA’s work in supporting the priorities of the RECs operating in
the Eastern and Southern African regions.
To further strengthen cooperation and identify priority areas of collaboration between
SADC and United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) for the next two to
three years, the SADC Secretariat held consultations with ECA in July 2019.
Subsequently, the SADC Secretariat, in collaboration with UNECA, prepared and
submitted concrete proposals in areas of future collaboration between SADC Secretariat
with UNECA. It was agreed that future areas of collaboration could, amongst others,
include Industrialisation; Infrastructure; Poverty; Data and Statistics; Gender and Women
Economic Empowerment; and Peace and Security.

6.8

SADC – ARAB BANK FOR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IN
AFRICA (BADEA) COOPERATION

The SADC Secretariat engaged with BADEA with a view of establishing a framework for
economic, financial and technical cooperation, and to strengthen and extend cooperation
specifically in the areas of industry, transportation, infrastructure, construction, energy,
water, health, trade, agriculture and investment on the basis of the principles of reciprocity
and mutual benefit.
SADC and BADEA also held technical level discussions on the modalities for cooperation,
which culminated into the development of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) which
will be signed by both Parties at a date to be agreed upon, focusing on the aforementioned
areas. In line with this, BADEA participated in the SADC Industrialization Week held in
Dar-es-Salaam, United Republic of Tanzania in July 2019, to provide an opportunity for
BADEA to advocate for its work through a regional platform attended by international
organizations and the Region’s private sector.

-----------------------Page 66 End-----------------------

The Dialogue commended the progress on the formulation of the SADC Vision 2050 and
RISDP 2020-2030 and gave assurance that the formulation was highly consultative
between SADC and relevant stakeholders/partners. Given the prevailing devastating
impacts of climate change and the socio-economic implications therein, both parties
agreed to establish a new Thematic Group on Climate Change and Disaster Risk
Management for purposes of ensuring a robust engagement mechanism on climate
change-related issues.
Finally, the Dialogue commended the implementation updates from seven Thematic
Groups (Water Strategy Reference Group, Peace & Security, Trade Industry Investment
& Finance, Energy, Agriculture and Food Security, Health Equity and Inclusive
Development and ICT) and urged all Thematic Groups to accordingly convene their semiannual meetings and prepare or update their existing annual workplans.

ORGANISATIONAL HEALTH AND CHANGE MANAGEMENT

7.1.1 RISK MANAGEMENT
The Secretariat identified Strategic and Operational risks that could impact on the
achievement of SADC objectives, and implemented 75% of the mitigation strategies that
were developed to minimize the likelihood and impact of those risks in the region. In this
regard, the Secretariat:
(i)

Finalised the Protocol on the industry and the regional mining vision;

(ii)

Built capacity in Member States on the implementation of SADC Protocol on
the control of firearms, ammunition, cybercrime, Illicit Tracing Management
System (ITMS), etc;

(iv) Enhanced the Secretariat corporate plan to address cross cutting issues;
(v)

Established regular planning session with International Cooperating Partners
(ICP’s) for all projects.

In addition, operational risks mitigation strategies were also developed to support these
strategic objectives, and 72% of mitigation strategies to minimize operational risks were
implemented as at 31 March 2020.
7.1.2 AUDIT
The Secretariat put in place measures to address the audit-identified gaps on internal
controls as follows:

67

-----------------------Page 67 End-----------------------

(i)

The total budget of US$86,061,341, was appropriated as follows:

68

-----------------------Page 68 End-----------------------

(i)

US$54,114,376 (63%) towards Programmes [Member States US$23,967,040
(44%) and ICPs: US$30,147,336 (56%)];

(ii)

Funds.

[Member

States

The highlights of the interim unaudited performance for 2019/20 financial Year are as
follows:
Revenue:
(i)

The actual total revenue amounted to US$66,949,544 (78%) of the revenue
budget of US$ US$86,061,341. [Member States: Actual revenue of
US$50,558,687 (91%) against a revenue budget of US$55,667,668; and ICPs:
Actual revenue of US$16,390,857 (54%) against a revenue budget of
US$30,393,673.
a) Annual Member States of US$7,876,433 were in arrears as of 31 March
2020; and
b) The revenue rate of 54% on International Cooperating Partners’
contributions was attributable to non-responsive bidders in the procurement
of the Service Providers for the PAGoDA Programmes, delays in
replenishment of funds, in particular PPDF and DBSA, and the adverse
impact of CONVID-19 pandemic experienced in Q4 of 2019/20 Financial
year.

Expenditure:
(i)

Overall actual expenditure of US$54,777,563 (69%) was recorded against a
total budget of US$79,075,550 excluding transfers to Contingency Fund and
Special Funds:
a) actual expenditure of US$38,366,326 (79%) against a budget of
US$48,878,877 funded by the Member States; and
b) actual expenditure of US$16,411,238 (54%) against the budget of
US$30,147,336 funded by International Development Cooperation.

(ii)

actual expenditure for Programmes was US$34,187,367 (63%) against
appropriated budget of US$54,114,376;

(iii)

actual expenditure for Support Services was US$20,590,196 (82%) against
the appropriated budget of US$24,961,174; and

(iv) Project Disbursements of Euro 21,929,733.86 (US$ 24,122,707.25) to the
Member States was made as follows;
69

-----------------------Page 69 End-----------------------

c) TRF Euro 17,205,859.00 (US$ 18,926,444.90);
d) PPDF-DBSA Euro 4,581,478.19 (US$ 5,039,626.01); and
e) Judicial Support Lesotho Euro 142,396.67 (156,636.34).
The overall expenditure utilisation rate of 69% excludes an amount of US$9.6million
Project funded disbursements to beneficiary Member States yet to be justified.
Analysis of Expenditure Variances:
The achieved level of utilization was mainly due to the following;
(i)

Member States funds: 79% budget utilization achieved due to the following:
a) Staff costs: Some positions budgeted for in 2019/20 financial year were not
filled-up throughout the year. These are positions for the PAGODA projects
in particular, and this was common to most Directorates;
b) Programme Costs: some planned technical workshops did not utilize all the
budgeted resources as they received support from the Member States and
International Cooperating Partners. There were also delays caused by nonresponsive bidders in the procurement process of Service Contracts,
postponements, and changes in the venues for some of the technical
meetings. The recent COVID-19 pandemic has also caused Directorates
and Units to cancel or postpone some planned activities in the last quarter
of the 2019/20 financial year. Some essential meetings and workshops
were conducted virtually using teleconference and/or video conference,
thus ended up costing less money than budgeted; and

(ii)

International Cooperating Partners (ICP) funds: 54% budget utilization
achieved due to the following:
a) non-responsive bidders in the procurement process of Service Contracts for
the Programmes, in particular on Support to Improving the Business and
Investment (SIBE) in the SADC region, the Trade Facilitation Programme
(TFP), Global Climate Change Alliance Plus (GCCA+), EU Dialogue
Facility, and IICB Programmes;
b) delays were experienced in the replenishment of funds, in particular on the
PPDF project managed by DBSA. The EU Delegation did not transfer Euro
3,395,560 as requested by the SADC Secretariat on behalf of DBSA for the
third tranche planned activities; and
c) COVID-19 pandemic also affected the implementation of International
Cooperating Partner funded activities during the last quarter of the 2019/20.
Major meetings and workshops were postponed or cancelled.

8. CHALLENGES AND LESSONS LEARNED
The milestones achieved during 2019/20 is demonstration that tangible results were
realised towards the SADC Agenda. However, despite the significant achievements, the
year was marked with challenges outlined below:
(i)

Efforts to strengthen conflict prevention, management and resolution have
mainly concentrated on strengthening Mediation, Conflict Prevention and
Preventative Diplomacy Structures. However, more concerted effort is
required to develop or strengthen national infrastructure for peace in order to
prevent potential conflict before it escalates. Regionally, the establishment of
a SADC Liaison Office in the Democratic Republic of Congo is an example of
pro-active regional peace initiatives that can assist to coordinate activities as
well as serve as an early warning mechanism. The major challenge is
sustained financing for the initiative and replicability if more than one conflict
flares up in the region.

(ii)

The COVID-19 pandemic has brought about challenges to national and
regional stability, peace and security which requires relentless efforts by
Member States in recalibrating actions towards mitigating the interrelated
socio-economic implications while preserving the territorial integrity and
curbing criminality. More than before the nexus between service delivery,
development, peace and security will be tested, requiring countries to build
resilience through harmonized and coordinated approaches at regional level.

(iii)

The market integration has been significantly affected by logistics and poor
transportation systems that remain a key hindrance to intra-regional trade and
heavy reliance on export of primary commodities that fetch low financial
returns. Effective delivery of Infrastructure development in the region is
important for regional integration. As such, there is need to intensify interaction
with the Member States and the agencies developing infrastructure projects at
national level. Member States have committed to institutionalize structures
responsible for infrastructure projects and to nominate national focal persons
for the main sectors of infrastructure. The nomination of national focal points
by Member States demonstrate commitment to coordinate infrastructure
projects effectively to promote regional integration.

(iv) Mobilisation of resources and ability to attract investments in all sectors for
infrastructure development projects remains a major challenge, despite
initiatives such as PIDA-PAP 2 programme and other related programmes
currently being promoted in the Region and at Continental level. The challenge
is exacerbated by limited capacity to formulate and prepare bankable projects

71

-----------------------Page 71 End-----------------------

at Member States. Furthermore, with the advent of COVID-19, the shift from
ICPs resources will greatly impact on projects feasibility studies and detailed
designs. This will create competition between infrastructure development and
social services for resources allocation from different players in the Region. As
a result, infrastructure projects scheduled to be completed in 2020/ 2021 are
likely to be delayed.
(v)

The absence of dedicated budget lines for nutrition programming in the
Member States is one of the contributing factors delaying scale up of high
impact nutrition interventions. Lessons from the United Republic of Tanzania
has shown that having dedicated budgets for nutrition can bring gains in the
implementation of nutrition interventions and this has led to the reduction of
stunting prevalence from 34.5% (2015) to the 31% (2018/2019) in Tanzania.
Within the Nutrition programme in 2019, the regional ICP network of nutrition
partners, have continued to support implementation of nutrition priorities in the
Member States as aligned to the SADC Food and Nutrition Security Strategy.

(vi) Lack of human and financial capacity at Member States’ level remain stumbling
blocks towards smooth implementation of Regional policies at domestic level.
As a result, the Secretariat is working closely with ICPs through country offices
to support domestication of regional policies. In relation to the implementation
of the SADC Qualifications Framework, the Secretariat has embarked on a
process of resource mobilisation to finance the setting up of an Implementation
Unit to facilitate and coordinate the implementation of the SADC Qualifications
Framework.
(vii) Some of the critical regional programmes are not prioritized for funding at
Member States’ level where implementation is critical. The implementation
report of the SADC Labour Migration Action Plan (2016-2019) revealed that
labour migration management was not sufficiently prioritised for ministries of
Labour to have capacity to implement their commitments under the Action
Plan. In this context, Member States continue to face limitations because of
significant human and financial constraints at both regional and national levels.
Therefore, there is need to continue strengthening the linkages and coherence
between regional and national programmes to ensure maximum impact.
(viii) Delays in securing timed and adequate technical expertise from relevant
partners to guide the consultancy process remains a concern. An example is
the delayed development of financial sustainability plan and institutional
framework of the Agricultural Development Fund. Securing adequate
partnerships right at the beginning of the assignment would have addressed
this challenge. There is need to capitalize on the existing and potential
partnerships for continuity of work. These include not only UN Agencies, with
72

-----------------------Page 72 End-----------------------

a wide scope of technical expertise, like FAO and WFP, and development
partners, but equally regional professional organizations and private sector.

9. CONCLUSIONS AND WAYFORWARD
The persistence of protracted election disputes, despite Member States meeting
minimum standards of electoral practice, needs to be addressed through strengthening
of post - election follow ups and the scrupulous implementation of the SEAC Strategy for
the Prevention of Electoral Related Conflict. Furthermore, SADC needs to invest in
electoral assistance initiatives which will require the sharing of technical expertise and
other resources with Member States that are challenged in meeting regional obligations.
This will require additional commitments from Member States as at the moment, the
activities are supported through limited ICP funding.
There is need to invest in the on-going exercise to identify and strengthen national
Infrastructure for peace – and factor strategic interventions into their future budgets. This
will continually position the Member States and the region to collectively and effectively
address challenges of peace and security. Capacity building on project preparation
programme for Member States should continue in order to strengthen them to acquire
knowledge and skills needed in project preparation;
Ratification of SADC Protocols on Trade and implementation of the provisions of the
Protocol in Member States, with priority given to sectors and activities that facilitate
SADC’s industrialization will strengthen SADC market integration. Market integration will
also benefit from embracing regional content requirements by Member States through a
‘Buy SADC’ campaign in order to facilitate value chain development within the region.
There is also a need to improve cross-border rail networks and corridors to facilitate the
flow of goods within the SADC region. This should include the involvement of the private
sector through the establishment of export trading companies and export credit facilities.
Addressing Non-Tariff Barriers (NTBs) in a timely manner to support development of
regional trade is another area that need to be improved. This includes developing an
effective system for the mutual recognition of NTMs to prevent the development of NTBs
that hinder industrial development at regional level.
The resource mobilization and investment for infrastructure activities remains a priority as
demonstrated by the establishment and operationalisation of the SADC Regional
Development Fund. The Fund is envisaged to enable regional infrastructure projects to
reach bankability stage with lesser challenges. As such, Member States are encouraged
to upload and submit regional infrastructure projects for consideration under the
continental Programme for Infrastructure Development in Africa - Priority Action Plan 2
(PIDA-PAP2) and to respond to the call for proposals that are issued by the different ICPs
from time-to-time to increase the opportunity of support.

73

-----------------------Page 73 End-----------------------

Close and regular engagement, communication and consultation between the
Secretariat, SADC and ICPs is key to addressing bottlenecks and administrative
challenges and delays. The Secretariat remains committed to consistently follow-up to
receiving inputs and ensuring completion of work processes. This will enhance full
understanding and comprehension of work processes to facilitate effective
implementation and delivery of key milestones. The Secretariat will further endeavour to
standardise ICT technologies being used in the development of regional programmes
information systems and provision of ICT services in an effort to improve communication
efficiency and effectiveness.
Despite the challenges encountered during 2019/20 Financial Year, significant progress
has been made towards implementation of programmes and projects towards regional
integration agenda. The Secretariat remains committed to the culture of attaining good
results, good governance and transparency. Going forward, the Secretariat re-affirms its
commitment towards facilitating implementation of programmes and projects and in
making sure that the Region collectively addresses emerging economic challenges for
the betterment of the SADC people.
