Introduction
1.
Despite the challenges posed by the coronavirus
disease (COVID-19) pandemic both on its functioning
and on the crises of which it is seized, the Security
Council remained fully mobilized in 2021.
Progressively returning to a normal conduct of business,
the Council took action to contribute to the resolution of
the conflicts under its consideration. It sought to strike
a right balance between transparency and confidentiality,
while endeavouring to be more inclusive and effective.
2.
During the reporting period, António Guterres was
reappointed Secretary-General by the General Assembly
upon recommendation by the Council, following a
transparent and inclusive process jointly agreed by the
Assembly and the Council.
3.
In 2021, the Council considered a total of 45 items.
The Council held most of its meetings by
videoconference during the first half of the year, while
almost all meetings were held in person during the
second half. While the wider membership was able to
contribute to open debates in writing when the
restrictions imposed under the pandemic prevented
participation in person, the Council resumed the holding
of open debates with the in-person participation of the
wider membership in October.
4.
The Council held a total of 150 public meetings,
90 open videoconferences, 14 private meetings and 124
consultations, as well as closed videoconferences.
Twenty-nine meetings were held at a high level,
compared with 19 in 2020 and 18 in 2019, while 34 were
unscheduled and held at the request of Council
members, mostly in response to crises unfolding across
the world, including in Ethiopia, Haiti, the Middle East
and Myanmar. In addition, the Council held seven
informal interactive dialogues, including four in a
virtual format. Lastly, wrap-up sessions were held each
month by all Presidents of the Council.
5.
The Council extended 354 invitations under
rule 39 of its provisional rules of procedure, including
44 invitations to officials representing regional and
intergovernmental organizations and 10 to representatives
of international organizations other than the United
Nations. It also invited 86 representatives of
non-governmental organizations and civil society,
compared with 51 in 2020 and 67 in 2019. In total,
56 per cent of the invitations extended under rule 39
were to men and 44 per cent to women, compared with
34 per cent of invitations extended to women in 2020
and 39 per cent in 2019.

6.
The Council conducted a mission to Mali and the
Niger that was co-led by France, Kenya and the Niger.
The mission was the first to be conducted since the start
of the COVID-19 pandemic, which illustrated the
progressive return to a normal conduct of business and
the resolve of the Council members to remain actively
engaged in the resolution of conflicts.
7.
During the reporting period, the Council adopted
57 resolutions and 24 presidential statements and issued
58 statements to the press. Forty-eight resolutions, or
84 per cent, were adopted unanimously, including six
presidential texts co-sponsored by all Council members.
The Council also adopted five notes by the President of
the Security Council regarding its working methods. No
procedural matters were put to the vote.
8.
Building on resolution 2532 (2020), the Council
unanimously adopted resolution 2565 (2021), in which
it called for the strengthening of international
cooperation in order to facilitate equitable and
affordable access to COVID-19 vaccines in armed
conflict situations, post-conflict situations and complex
humanitarian emergencies.
9.
The situation in Africa continued to occupy an
important place in the work of the Council, as reflected
by the adoption of 26 resolutions and 11 presidential
statements related to that continent. Africa also
accounted for almost 50 per cent of all country-specific
meetings and open videoconferences. The Council was
also mobilized on Middle East issues. Seven resolutions
concerned that region, which was the subject of more
than 30 per cent of all country-specific meetings and
open videoconferences.
10. The Council maintained its attention on the
humanitarian consequences of the conflicts of which it
is seized and their impact on civilians and children, as
well as on the role of women in preventing and resolving
conflict.
11. The Council also held discussions and exchanged
views on a range of emerging issues, including security
in the use of information and communications
technology, climate and security and the COVID-19
pandemic.
12. The sanctions regimes remained an important tool
for the Council, and 10 of them were renewed in 2021.
13. The Council adopted decisions regarding nine
peacekeeping operations and special political missions
in 2021. At the end of the year, 72,789 peacekeepers

were deployed across 12 missions in support of the
Council’s mandates. Council members noted with
appreciation the contribution of United Nations
peacekeepers to international peace and security and

their lives in 2021. Recognizing the need to ensure
accountability for crimes committed against peacekeepers,
the Council unanimously adopted resolution 2589
(2021), in which it called for the perpetrators of such
crimes to be brought to justice.

and more detailed accounts of its meetings can be found

Part IV
Report of the Military Staff Committee
I. Introduction
1.
The present report of the Military Staff Committee covers the period from
1 January 2021 to 31 December 2021.

II. Background
2.
The Military Staff Committee was established in accordance with Article 47 of
the Charter of the United Nations and Security Council resolution 1 (1946). The
Committee has a mandate to advise and assist the Security Council on all questions
relating to the military requirements of the Council for the maintenance of
international peace and security, the employment and command of forces placed at its
disposal, the regulation of armaments, and possible disarmament.

III. Summary of the activities of the Committee
3.
The Committee functioned continuously under the revised draft statue and
revised draft rules of Procedure contained in document S/115 of 1 August 1946,
during the period under review. It held a total of 26 meetings and discussed 35 topics.
4.
Military representatives of the elected members of the Security Council actively
participated in 26 meetings. Representatives of Secretariat departments were inv ited
to brief the Committee and contributed to discussions: the Department of Peace
Operations on 19 topics, the Department of Political and Peacebuilding Affairs on
seven topics, the Department of Operational Support on three topics and the
Department of Management Strategy, Policy and Compliance on one topic. Mission
Force Commanders were also invited to brief the Committee.
5.
Current United Nations peacekeeping and special political missions were the
focus of 22 briefings, and various thematic issues were discussed at 13 meetings (see
appendix IV.A).
6.
To ensure the continuity of its work in the current extraordinary circumstances
created by the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, the Committee held 16
meetings via videoconferencing.
7.
During the reporting period, the Committee planned and was prepared to
conduct one field mission to the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated
Stabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA). The mission was eventually held in
another format owing to visa issues for the Committee Members concerning the
Russian Delegation.
8.
The Committee continues to announce all meetings and provisional agendas in
the Journal of the United Nations and on the website, which is available in the six
official languages of the United Nations and offers swift and easy access to the
programme of work and current information on the Committee.
9.
In accordance with paragraph 178 of General Assembly resolution 60/1 entitled
“2005 World Summit Outcome”, the Committee continues considering its
composition, mandate and working methods.
