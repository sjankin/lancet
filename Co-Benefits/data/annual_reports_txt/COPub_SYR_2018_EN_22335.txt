FOREWORD
Regular health assessments underpin everything
we do. They allow us to implement transparent,
impartial and timely interventions that are grounded
in science and based on demonstrated needs. They
focus our response on substantive matters and
reduce the scope for political considerations. This
past year we assessed the health situation in IDP
camps in the northeast and the status of trauma care
services in Ar-Raqqa city and surrounding areas. The
health cluster in Amman, led by WHO, produced the
first comprehensive picture of health care services in
southern Syria. Our hub in Gaziantep examined the
treatment options for growing numbers of patients
with tuberculosis in north-west Syria. These are just
some examples – there were many more.

In 2018, the rapidly evolving situation in Syria
required WHO to intervene in many different
geographic locations. We responded to simultaneous
health emergencies in eastern Ghouta, northern rural
Homs, south-west, north-east and north-west Syria.
Our focal points across the country were our eyes and
ears. Working under difficult and often dangerous
circumstances, they assessed each situation and
worked closely with our office in Damascus, our

4

hubs in Gaziantep and Amman and our cross-border
partners in north-east Syria to plan and implement
interventions targeting those most in need.
We monitored almost 1100 hospitals and primary
health care (PHC) centres throughout the country
and delivered medicines and supplies to where they
were needed most. Almost 100 hospitals received
essential medical equipment in 2018.

We responded to outbreaks of acute diarrhoea and
typhoid fever in the north and hepatitis A in the
south. In response to measles outbreaks across the
country, we worked closely with partners to vaccinate
children at points of entry in IDP camps, through
routine immunization services and during national
immunization days. An outbreak of circulating
vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2, first detected in
2017, was successfully controlled thanks to strong
coordination between our offices in Damascus,
Amman and Gaziantep, with close support from our
regional and headquarters offices. We worked with
government agencies and partners to test water
quality throughout the country and make sure that
hospitals had safe water supplies. We expanded our
nutrition activities. Over 800 nutritional surveillance
units in health care facilities screened children
for malnutrition and referred them for specialized
treatment when necessary. We successfully launched
a school-based mental health programme and
continued to train non-specialist health professionals
in PHC centres on basic interventions to help patients
in distress.

WHO continues to be the authoritative voice on the
health situation in Syria. On behalf of all partners,
we appealed for an end to attacks on health care
and called for the guaranteed medical evacuation of
critically ill patients and their families from besieged
and hard-to-reach areas. In November, we briefed
the UN Security Council in New York on the impact
of the crisis on Syria’s health care system and set out
the minimum steps to be taken to improve the lives
of millions of vulnerable people.
Primary health care is the backbone of the health
response in Syria and the theme of this year’s annual
report. Strong collaboration with our NGO partners
ensured that millions of Syrians, especially those
in besieged and hard-to-reach areas, continued to
receive basic health care through mobile teams and
clinics.
Over the past seven years, we have trained tens of
thousands of health care providers throughout Syria.
An evaluation of the effectiveness of our training
programme is underway. We are assessing the
quality of our NGO partners and continuing to train
them and other health care providers to help ensure
that they are able to provide quality care to some of
the most vulnerable people in Syria.
Over the last year I travelled throughout the country
to meet and talk with ordinary Syrians, many of whom
have lost everything. Their dignity and resilience
in the face of so much suffering is a testament to
their courage and spirit. I also met many health care
staff working in cities, towns and villages throughout
Syria. Seeing at first hand the difference that they are
making in the lives of their fellow Syrians has been
one of the most humbling and moving experiences
of my life.

SITUATION IN 2018
Overview
Millions of innocent civilians continued to bear the
brunt of the Syrian conflict. In 2018, approximately 1.5
million people were newly displaced by hostilities in
many areas including eastern Ghouta, the south and
north-west, northern rural Homs and eastern Deirez-Zor. Overall, more than 13 million people in Syria
need humanitarian assistance, 5.2 million acutely
so. At least 6.2 million people have been displaced,
many of them more than once. Two thirds of Syrians
are living under the poverty line.
Political instability persisted. By the end of June,
the Syrian government had ended its longstanding
sieges and regained control of several areas formerly
controlled by non-state armed groups. Conversely,
Syrian non-state armed groups and Turkish military
forces took control of most of Afrin district in Aleppo
governorate, resulting in the collapse of the local
health system and the displacement of 167 000
people.
Changes in political control led to further waves of
displacement to and within north-west Syria. Tens of
thousands of internally displaced people (IDPs) from
eastern Ghouta, northern rural Homs and southern
Hama were forcibly evacuated to Idleb governorate.
The population of Idleb has doubled since 2011 and
most IDPs there have very limited access to health
care and other services.
There were outbreaks of measles, leishmaniasis and
acute bloody diarrhoea, fuelled by displacement,
hostilities and poor living conditions. Vaccination
coverage rates remained low despite mass
immunization campaigns and routine vaccination

activities to curb the spread of diseases such as
vaccine-derived polio and measles. Shortages of
safe drinking water, due in part to the deliberate
targeting of water networks, left up to 35% of the
population relying on alternative and often unsafe
water sources1.
The operating environment in Syria continued to be
demanding. WHO and other humanitarian agencies
faced significant challenges to delivering assistance
because of heavy fighting, the widespread presence
of improvised explosive devices, and delays in
obtaining authorization to enter many areas. In
December 2018, the United Nations Security Council
reiterated its grave concern over hindrances to the
delivery of humanitarian assistance. It called on all
parties to allow the safe, unimpeded and sustained
passage of humanitarian convoys to all parts of
Syria and renewed its earlier resolution (2165)
authorizing the delivery of humanitarian aid from the
neighbouring countries of Iraq, Jordan and Turkey2 .
In 2018, WHO and the United Nations shifted from
a response by geographical location to one based
on a detailed assessment of the severity of needs in
all 270 sub-districts in Syria3. While this has allowed
for a more targeted delivery of assistance, it cannot
be used as the only measure for determining health
interventions. WHO has continued to work in areas
with relatively low severity of need4 in order to
vaccinate children and raise vaccination coverage
rates across the country. It also continues to support
referral hospitals located in areas of low severity
because they provide essential services to people
from nearby areas still caught up in the conflict.

Severity scales are used by humanitarian agencies to estimate the severity of needs at sub-district level. The severity scale, set out in the Humanitarian
Response Plan for 2018, is derived from a range of data sources that yield information on 1) accessibility to health care, 2) number of people affected, 3)
humanitarian access, 4) the availability of health resources and services, and 5) the impact of the conflict on health and morbidity.
4
The severity of needs in different geographic locations in Syria are based on a scale from 0 to 6. Areas ranked between 4 and 6 are classified as being
in acute and immediate need of humanitarian assistance.

It is clear that humanitarian needs will continue
throughout Syria for some time, regardless of
who is in charge. Two thirds of people in need of
humanitarian assistance currently live in areas under
the control of the government, with the remainder
in areas controlled by non-state armed groups and
other forces.

The impact of the crisis
on health care delivery
The continuing conflict and waves of displacement
placed a massive strain on the health system. In
2018, fewer than half of the previously existing public
health care facilities were fully functioning. Fighting
continued in many areas; mobile medical teams were
unable to reach patients and patients were unable to
reach hospitals and PHC centres. The situation was
compounded by attacks on health care facilities and
personnel that deprived tens of thousands of Syrians
of health care at the time they needed it most.
There were severe shortages of medical specialists,
medicines and supplies, especially in rural and
historically deprived areas and those that were
formerly besieged or hard to reach. In many parts
of the country, medical supply chains functioned
only sporadically, leading to widespread shortages
of medicines to treat common diseases. Although
public health care facilities were supposed to provide
medicines free of charge, many patients were forced
to buy them in private pharmacies because they
were not available otherwise.
For people wounded in the conflict, the outlook was
grim. In many hospitals, essential equipment was
broken and could not be repaired, partly because
international sanctions prevented the importation

5

of critical spare parts. There were acute shortages
of reconstructive surgery and other services to treat
badly burned patients. Emergency surgery for trauma
patients was often delayed because supplies and
equipment were lacking. Thousands of wounded
Syrians had no access to physical rehabilitation
services. Approximately 15% of Syrians have suffered
disabilities as a result of the conflict, and almost half
of them are likely to have lifelong impairments that
will require specialist support long after the hostilities
have ended.
Widespread bombing and shelling have wounded
hundreds of thousands, but the disruption of the health
care system has been equally devastating for millions
of Syrians who are living with one or more chronic
diseases. WHO estimates that approximately 12% of
Syrians have diabetes and around 20% suffer from
high blood pressure5. Left untreated, these diseases
can lead to serious complications such as heart attacks
and kidney failure. There were widespread shortages
of medicines and specialist services to treat patients
with cancer, renal failure and other serious illnesses.
Untold numbers of people in Syria have died because
they could no longer obtain the life-saving medicines
and treatments they once took for granted.

damaged TB hospital in Aleppo.
WHO

Disease outbreaks
In 2018, there were outbreaks of acute bloody
diarrhoea, typhoid fever and hepatitis A. These
diseases are almost always the result of unclean
water and poor sanitation and they disproportionately
affect the poorest and most vulnerable.
The number of cases of measles doubled compared
with 2017. Rates of cutaneous leishmaniasis,
which is endemic in north-west Syria, rose sharply,
highlighting Syrians’ increasing vulnerability to
communicable diseases. Rates of tuberculosis (TB)
are estimated to be on the rise (15.8 per 100 000
people in 2017 compared with 13 per 100 000
people in 2013). Because the national TB surveillance
system has been badly disrupted, the real number
might be much higher.

There were also success stories. WHO and the health
authorities managed to stem an outbreak of vaccinederived poliovirus that began in 2017. Cases of
vaccine-derived poliovirus are a warning sign. They
occur when vaccination rates are dangerously low.
WHO and UNICEF are working to strengthen routine
vaccination services in PHC centres and support mass
vaccination campaigns in newly accessible areas.
Sustained efforts will be required to protect the
country’s children against measles, polio and other
vaccine-preventable diseases.
Page 50 of this report describes WHO’s response to
disease outbreaks in greater detail.

Attacks on health care
Access to people
in need
In 2018, the number of people living in hard-to-reach
areas dropped from almost 3 million to just over 1.1
million. Moreover, for the first time in over five years,
no areas in Syria were classified as besieged by the
UN. This led to improved access to several parts of
the country to deliver humanitarian aid. However,
ongoing hostilities, the widespread presence of
explosive remnants of war and bureaucratic obstacles
continued to hamper operations.
WHO’s efforts focused on reaching people in areas
where political control had changed and where
health needs were severe. In many of these areas,
people had suffered for years under siege, had been
subjected to intense military activity, or had seen no
resumption of basic services since changes in control.

UN Security Council Resolution 2165 (2014) authorizing
the UN and partners to deliver humanitarian aid to
people throughout Syria from neighbouring countries
provided a lifeline to millions of Syrians. WHO’s
cross-border operations from Iraq, Jordan and Turkey
were crucial to delivering humanitarian assistance to
people who could not be reached from Damascus.
WHO’s hub in Gaziantep accounted for approximately
43% of the total volume of medical supplies delivered
by WHO in 2018.

WHO uses the Organization’s new online system –
the global Surveillance System for Attacks on Health
Care (SSA) - to track attacks on health care facilities
and personnel in Syria. The SSA uses a standardized
methodology to allow it to identify global and
context-specific trends and allow comparisons
between regions and contexts. There were 139
confirmed attacks on health care in Syria in 2018.
Syria accounted for the second-highest number
of attacks worldwide, second only to the occupied
Palestine Territories.

Throughout the year, WHO advocated on behalf
of all its health partners for the free passage of
medicines, equipment, supplies and personnel to all
parts of Syria and the safe passage of critically ill and
wounded patients to health care facilities outside
conflict zones.

Inter-agency convoys
The number of inter-agency convoys inside Syria
dropped sharply (17 in 2018 compared with 41 in
2017) as more areas came under government control.
At the request of the government, WHO and its UN
partners delivered supplies to these locations through
their regular programmes rather than through interagency convoys.

In June 2018, the Al-Ehsan hospital and the E.
Ghariyeh blood bank in Dar’a were badly damaged by
airstrikes and forced to close. The airstrikes killed one
health care worker and injured two others. Until then,
the hospital had been providing 8300 consultations
each month and the blood bank had been providing
480 units of blood each month to health care facilities
throughout southern Syria. The airstrikes essentially
wiped out the entire blood supply for all areas in
southern Syria that were under the control of nonstate armed groups.

Reported use of chemical weapons
In early April, reports emerged concerning the new
use of chemical weapons in the town of Douma in
eastern Ghouta. The signs and symptoms reported
to WHO were consistent with exposure to toxic
chemicals. At the time of writing, the incident is
still under investigation by the Organization for the
Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW).
On 24 November 2018, WHO received unconfirmed
reports of patients arriving in health care facilities in
Aleppo with symptoms consistent with exposure to
chemical agents. At approximately the same time,
the United Nations Department of Safety and Security
office in Syria reported unconfirmed information that
several areas of Aleppo city had been shelled with
rounds of mortar fire that included an unknown type
of gas. According to unconfirmed reports, dozens
of patients were admitted to Aleppo’s two public
hospitals. WHO activated its emergency procedures
and immediately distributed supplies requested by
the hospitals and the Syrian Arab Red Crescent (SARC).
All 122 victims of these attacks were discharged from
the hospitals the following day. This incident is also
under investigation by the OPCW.

WHO has been helping the country prepare for
the management of chemical events since 2012.
It has trained more than 900 health care workers
(including 265 clinicians in Aleppo and 80 in Idleb)
on immediate decontamination, referral, triage and
treatment measures. WHO maintains strategic stocks
of protective equipment for health care workers and
kits of medicines that are distributed to hospitals and
medical points that undergo training. The Organization
has issued clinical management protocols, distributed
personal protective equipment to hospitals and health
care facilities, and raised Syrians’ awareness of how
to protect themselves against exposure and when to
seek treatment. WHO’s hub in Gaziantep has recently
trained 160 first responders in northern Syria on basic
measures to respond to the victims of exposure to
toxic chemical agents. To help manage Syrian patients
evacuated to Turkey, WHO has also trained Turkish
medical rescue teams in areas bordering Syria.
WHO reiterates the United Nations SecretaryGeneral’s statement that any confirmed use of such
weapons, by any party to the conflict and under any
circumstances, is abhorrent and a clear violation of
international law.

go unreported so as not to jeopardize the safety of
hostages and their families.
The consequences of every attack on a hospital or
PHC centre are immediate and devastating. Hospitals
are forced to suspend their services, putting the lives
of their patients at risk. The psychological toll on
staff and patients is enormous. Each attack is a major
violation of international humanitarian law and an
affront to the universal right to health care. In Syria,
these attacks continue unabated despite universal
outrage and condemnation. Tens of thousands of
Syrians injured in the conflict have died or suffered
lifelong disabilities because they were unable to
obtain timely medical assistance.

Joint contingency and
preparedness planning
WHO contributed to UN and health partners’
preparedness and response plans that focused on
locations where changes in political control or access
status were likely to significantly affect humanitarian
needs. All WHO offices and hubs in Syria worked
closely to coordinate response plans with each other
and with other health partners.
WHO’s hub in Gaziantep continually updated its
contingency plans in preparation for potential largescale military operations in north-west Syria. It
identified 21 hospitals in potentially volatile areas
that could respond to mass casualty events, including

chemical incidents. Over 250 first responders and
other health care staff in this region were trained on
managing trauma patients.
In March 2018, in anticipation of increased conflict
in southern Syria, WHO’s hub in Amman convened
a planning workshop with health cluster partners,
security experts and local authorities. The group
identified areas where hostilities were likely to be
concentrated and where pre-positioned supplies
would be critical for treating wounded or displaced
people.

Main geographic areas
of response
Eastern Ghouta
In early 2018, up to 400 000 people in eastern Ghouta
were subjected to heavy bombardments and ground
attacks that led to increasing civilian casualties. Almost
100 000 people fled the area, and tens of thousands
sought refuge in eight shelters in Rural Damascus.
WHO supported health care services for these
IDPs, many of whom had serious health problems
following years of living under siege. The Organization
delivered 74 tonnes of health supplies, visited all
shelters regularly to assess health needs, established
disease surveillance, supported the delivery of lifesaving health care and identified and filled gaps in
services. Thirty-four mobile teams supported by WHO
provided nutritional screening services and referred
18 severely malnourished children for specialized

14

treatment. NGOs supported by WHO provided almost
409 000 consultations. More than 4200 people were
referred to public hospitals and over 55 000 children
were vaccinated against polio and other childhood
diseases. Community workers and mobile teams
provided basic psychological interventions to almost
34 000 people.

A degree of stability has returned to eastern Ghouta,
but health needs are still immense and growing.
Thousands of people are returning to areas that were
previously densely populated but have been largely
destroyed. The recovery of severely disrupted health
care services in eastern Ghouta will require shortand long-term support from WHO.

South-west Syria
In June 2018, heavy and sustained air and ground
offensives in southern Syria killed dozens of civilians
including children and injured hundreds of others.
By the end of the month, up to 325 000 people
had reportedly fled their homes and villages. Tens
of thousands of IDPs gathered at the closed border
crossing between Jordan and Syria. WHO and other
UN agencies and partners worked with the Jordanian
authorities to support the coordination of medical
consultations and patient referrals to hospitals in
Jordan. WHO donated emergency health supplies to
the Jordanian Royal Medical Services to support the
increasing caseload of wounded patients.
In Dar’a, several hospitals and health care centres
were damaged and forced to close. Cross-border aid
convoys from Jordan were temporarily suspended
due to the intensive bombardment. WHO’s office in
Damascus and its hub in Amman worked closely on
the emergency response, in coordination with local
health authorities. WHO distributed over 70 tonnes
of medicines and supplies to health care facilities in

Rukban
south-west Syria and supported NGOs that provided
more than 97 000 PHC consultations through fixed
clinics and mobile teams.
In early July 2018, cross-border access from Amman
to Syria was blocked after the Government of Syria
regained control of the border. As a result, WHO’s
hub in Amman ceased its cross-border support
and transferred operations to WHO’s main office in
Damascus.
Although families displaced during the hostilities
are gradually returning to their homes, the relative
calm has not reduced their need for health assistance
and services. However, badly damaged health
care facilities and severe shortages of health care
professionals, compounded by bureaucratic delays,
have limited the ability of the health sector to address
health needs. Revitalizing health care facilities and
reintegrating and training health care staff remain
key priorities for WHO.

Around 40 000 people, mostly women and children,
remained stranded in dire conditions in Rukban
settlement close to the Jordanian border. Only very
basic health care was available, and the only freeof-charge facility had no electricity, running water or
official medical supplies. There were no doctors in the
camp (health care services were provided by nurses
and midwives), and morbidity and mortality rates
were reported to be high.
People in Rukban were able to obtain health care
services at the UN clinic in the militarized zone on
the Jordanian side of the border, after first being
screened and transported by the Jordanian armed
forces. The clinic provided paediatric, immunization,
reproductive health and adult health care services.
Patients requiring specialized or emergency care
were transferred to hospitals in Jordan. However, for
security reasons, the clinic did not provide round-theclock services and its activities were suspended when
deemed necessary by the Jordanian authorities.

Direct access by the UN to the Rukban population
from Jordan remained prohibited. In early November,
an inter-agency and SARC convoy managed to reach
people in Rukban for the first time in over nine months.
WHO delivered over three tonnes of medicines and
medical supplies (enough for 31 601 treatments) to
health personnel in the camp and assessed the health
situation and health needs. In late December, the UN’s
Emergency Relief Coordinator briefed the UN Security
Council on the situation in Rukban and asked for its
support to obtain secure access to the settlement and
rapid approval for the next humanitarian convoy.
The residents of Rukban wanted to leave the
settlement. The UN urged that they be allowed
to leave voluntarily, in dignity and security, with
guarantees for their safe return to their places of
relocation.

Northern Rural Homs
The predominantly agricultural area of northern rural
Homs was besieged for several years until a ceasefire
agreement was reached in May 2018. Following the
change in political control, responsibility for northern
rural Homs was transferred from WHO’s hub in
Gaziantep to its office in Damascus.
Over 30 000 people left for Idleb governorate as
part of the ceasefire agreement, but the more than
18 0000 people who remained had very little access
to health care services. Years of living under siege
with limited access to food and health care had led to

high rates of malnutrition and deaths from untreated
life-threatening diseases such as cancer. Thousands
of children had not been vaccinated for several
years. WHO supported the operating costs of health
care services provided by mobile medical teams and
clinics. By the end of the year, around 14 000 children
had been vaccinated against routine childhood
illnesses, 14 PHC centres had partially reopened and
the disease surveillance system had been reactivated.
Access to northern rural Homs improved in late 2018
following the government’s agreement to grant UN
staff blanket access to the area.

North-west Syria
Almost 4 million people in north-west Syria live in
areas7 controlled by non-state armed groups. The
security situation remained highly precarious in 2018
and the continuing hostilities in many locations cut
off humanitarian access to people in need. Highintensity shelling and airstrikes damaged hospitals
and PHC centres and disrupted referral systems and
medical supply chains. Attacks on health care facilities
rose significantly compared with 2017. There were
widespread shortages of medicines and supplies and
severe shortages of specialized health care services
to treat diseases such as cancer, leishmaniasis and
kidney disease.
Hundreds of thousands of new IDPs arrived in Idleb
governorate following changes of political control in
other parts of the country. IDPs accounted for half of
Idleb’s population. Many had suffered conflict-related
injuries that required hospitalization, placing a further
strain on severely overstretched health care facilities
in the governorate.

7

Idleb was by no means a safe haven for the hundreds
of thousands of people evacuated from besieged
areas. The governorate remained on the edge of a
humanitarian disaster. Most IDPs were living in dire
conditions with very limited access to health care,
water and sanitation and other basic services. Regular
airstrikes, growing levels of crime, kidnappings
and inter-factional fighting continued to hamper
humanitarian access.

In preparation for a possible large-scale offensive and
to mitigate potentially difficult cross-border access
during military operations, WHO and health partners
scaled up preparedness and contingency planning
for north-west Syria. The plans included provisions
for potentially high numbers of trauma patients in
the event of major hostilities and the possible use of
chemical weapons. In the autumn of 2018, Gaziantep
delivered its largest-ever cross-border shipment of

emergency medicines and supplies to north-west
Syria. A total of 104 tonnes of supplies were delivered
to 180 health care facilities.
In September 2018, Russia and Turkey announced the
creation of a demilitarized zone, but no further details
of the agreement emerged. The UN Secretary-General
warned of the dire humanitarian consequences of a
further escalation of violence.

In September 2018, WHO’s
hub in Gaziantep delivered
its largest-ever shipment to
north-west Syria.
WHO Gaziantep

Throughout the year, WHO’s hub in Gaziantep
supported the operating costs of 38 primary and
secondary health care facilities, 185 mobile teams
and 54 mobile clinics and ambulances. Gaziantep
delivered 497 tonnes of medical supplies to the areas
where health needs were greatest and supported
1.8 million PHC consultations and the treatment of
more than 88 800 trauma patients. Gaziantep also
supported partners through the provision of technical
expertise and training.

Afrin district
In March 2018, following almost two months of
military operations, Syrian non-state armed groups
and Turkish military forces took control of Afrin
district in western Aleppo governorate, resulting in
the displacement of at least 167 000 people and
the severe disruption of the health system. Most
PHC centres ceased to operate, and only one of the
four hospitals in Afrin city remained open during the
hostilities.
Most people were displaced to the neighbouring
areas of Fafin, Nabul, Taal Refaat and Zahraa.
WHO supported the operational costs of six mobile
teams and two fixed health care facilities providing

North-east Syria
integrated PHC and mental health services in areas of
displacement. The Organization delivered trauma kits,
intravenous fluids, antibiotics and other medicines to
the SARC, NGO partners and the Directorate of Health
of Aleppo.
By the end of 2018, basic health care services had
been re-established in Afrin district. In some areas,
a system was put in place to refer patients who
needed specialized medical treatment. For example,
patients with kidney disease were being referred to
haemodialysis centres in Azaz, Jarablus, Nabul and
Taal Refaat.

Health care services in the three governorates of
north-east Syria8 were almost non-existent and
health needs were high. Although Ar-Raqqa city
remained highly dangerous and littered with the
explosive remnants of war, none of its public
hospitals was adequately staffed and equipped to
treat trauma patients. Very few health partners were
operating inside the city or in the entire governorate.
To compound the challenges, all three governorates
operated under different governments that did not
recognize the Ministry of Health (MOH) and vice
versa.

supplies. The situation remained highly volatile. In
late 2018, thousands of people in Deir-ez-Zor were
displaced following military operations against the
Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. In December
2018, WHO updated its contingency plans in
preparation for possible Turkish military incursions
into north-east Syria. WHO anticipated that any such
incursion would have a dramatic effect on the already
highly compromised health care services in the area
and might require a shift in operations from WHO’s
office in Damascus to its hub in Gaziantep.

In four IDP camps assessed by WHO, two thirds of
households were struggling with mental health
problems. The measles vaccine coverage rate was not
high enough to ensure herd immunity9. There were
shortages of medicines to treat chronic diseases, and
referral services were extremely limited. Even when
patients were referred, most hospitals had very little
capacity to treat them.
In 2018, WHO delivered over 245 tonnes of medical
equipment and supplies (enough to address the
health needs of more than 200 000 people) to northeast Syria through the Al-Yarubiyah border crossing in
Iraq. The supplies, transported in nine separate crossborder convoys, were delivered to eight international
NGOs working in the northeast. WHO also supported
an international NGO that was providing PHC and
emergency referral services in Ar-Raqqa city. In 2018,
this NGO provided health care to over 10 000 people.

WHO’S HEALTH RESPONSE
This year’s annual report is structured around the
health objectives set out in the joint Humanitarian
Response Plan for Syria10 for 2018. WHO contributes
to five objectives (three for health, one for nutrition
and one for water, sanitation and hygiene).

Health objective 1:
Provide life-saving and life-sustaining
humanitarian health assistance

PHC services

WHO Gaziantep

Over the course of 2018, more than 137 000
refugees returned to Syria, and this trend looks set
to continue and increase. The rehabilitation of PHC
services, water and sanitation networks and other
basic infrastructure will be increasingly important as
hundreds of thousands of people begin returning to
their homes and villages. Good PHC services improve
the health status of the people they serve, provide
preventive care and health education, and alleviate
the burden of disease. At their heart, they are about
caring for people rather than simply treating specific
diseases or conditions.
While PHC centres meet most of an individual’s health
needs over the course of his or her life, they are
also the entry point to refer patients for secondary
and tertiary health care. Maintaining PHC services is

Mobile teams

therefore critical to ensure that patients can obtain
specialist health care when needed.
In 2018, WHO monitored stocks in over 1200 PHC
centres and delivered medicines, supplies and
medical equipment to facilities throughout the
country. The Organization trained thousands of PHC
staff and supported follow-up on-the-job supervision.
PHC centres supported by WHO provided over 3.5
million consultations.
NGOs throughout Syria have stepped in to provide
essential PHC services, especially in besieged and
hard-to-reach areas. WHO works with a network of
75 national health NGs and supports them through
providing training opportunities and technical advice
and delivering medicines and supplies. Page 48 of
this report describes how WHO has trained its NGO
partners and monitored their work.

WHO supported approximately 75 mobile teams that
provided PHC services throughout Syria, particularly in
hard-to-reach areas. In 2018, these teams provided
more than 600 000 consultations. Page 49 of this report
describes the work of mobile teams in more detail.

Essential package of
health care services
In 2018, more than half of functioning PHC centres in
Syria provided all services in the essential package of
health care services developed by the Syrian MOH.
The package describes the services, staff, medicines,
equipment and supplies that should be available in
all centres.
WHO’s hub in Gaziantep has introduced a similar
package of essential health care services for northwest Syria. Approximately half of PHC centres
provided the full range of services. Most of them
provided nutritional screening services and treatment
for communicable and noncommunicable diseases,
but other services were lacking. One of the main
challenges was the lack of reliable long-term funding
to support the sustainability of services.

Main components of the essential package
of health care services in Syria
•

General clinical services including oral health and
dental care

•

Child health: vaccination, under-5 clinic,
management of diarrhoea

•

Nutrition: screening, management of acute
malnutrition

•

Communicable diseases: diagnosis and treatment
of TB and other locally relevant diseases

•

Noncommunicable diseases: asthma, chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease, cardiovascular
disease, hypertension, diabetes

•

Sexual and reproductive health: maternal and
newborn health, sexually transmitted infections,
HIV/AIDS

•

Mental health care

•

Emergency trauma care

Gaziantep also supported supplementary polio and
measles vaccination campaigns that aimed to reach
at least 80% vaccination coverage in each district of
north-west Syria.

In 2018, the number of vaccination centres
supported by WHO’s hub in Gaziantep rose from 54
to 94. The new centres are located in Afrin (where
vaccination centres were forced to close following
military operations in early 2018) and areas with
high population densities. As of the end of 2018,
up to 26 700 children under one year of age were
being vaccinated with Penta vaccine11 each month.

WHO helped strengthen Syria’s national polio
programme by improving surveillance, training
health care workers and supporting the establishment
of a system to collect sewage water and test it for
poliovirus. The system was launched in January
2018 in two governorates; by the end of the year it
had expanded to cover 10 out of 14 governorates.
WHO also upgraded the national polio laboratory in

care facilities. By the end of 2018, 4400 patients
were being referred through the network each

use of limited resources by reducing overlaps and
duplication in services. To mitigate severe shortages
of health care staff and ease the pressure on health
care professionals, some tasks formerly handled by
physicians were transferred to support staff.

Gaziantep collaborates closely with the Syrian
Immunization Group, a consortium of NGOs
implementing immunization activities in northwest Syria. WHO provided technical guidance for
vaccination activities, supported the operational costs
of 35 vaccination centres and trained and deployed
over 4900 field workers to support vaccination
campaigns.

Basic Emergency Obstetric Care (BEOC)

WHO’s hub in Gaziantep coordinated and supported
a network of 38 PHC centres that adopted common
standards to strengthen the quality of care and
increase health care coverage. This experience led to
the creation of a larger referral network of 62 primary
and secondary health care structures, with technical
and operational support provided by WHO. The
network allowed patients to be rapidly referred for
diagnosis and treatment in other participating health

Over 1300 vaccination centres supported by 195
mobile teams and 94 outreach teams provided routine
vaccination services throughout Syria. Mobile teams
vaccinated children in schools, IDP camps, collective
shelters and high-risk areas. WHO supported mass
vaccination campaigns, local campaigns and national
immunization weeks. It focused on vaccinating
children in areas of northern Syria where access
improved in 2018. However, vaccination coverage
rates in these areas remain dangerously low; in some
areas of Deir-ez-Zor governorate, the coverage rate
for diphtheria, tetanus and polio was as low as 8% as
of October 2018.

WHO’s hub in Gaziantep has established a surveillance
system to better detect wild and vaccine-derived
poliovirus. Samples from people suspected of having
the disease are collected in north-west Syria and
sent to Turkey’s national polio laboratory in Ankara
for diagnosis. In 2018, 1624 samples were sent to
the laboratory in Ankara; all tested negative for the
disease.
By the end of 2018, approximately 2.6 million children
in Syria had been vaccinated against polio. Oral polio
vaccine needs to be administered many times to
be fully effective. The number of doses it takes to
immunize a child depends entirely on the child’s
health and nutritional status, and how many other
viruses s/he has been exposed to. Children who are

not fully immunized are still at risk from polio. This
emphasizes the need for all children to be vaccinated
during every round of national immunization days.
By the end of 2018, WHO estimated that vaccination
coverage rates had risen by 4% compared with the
end of 2017. While this indicates that WHO’s efforts
are meeting with some success, the increase is not
enough to ensure herd immunity. Continued efforts
will be required to help ensure that every last child is
immunized against measles and polio.
Appendix 1 at the end of this report gives more details
concerning the vaccination campaigns supported by
WHO in 2018.

“This training will help educate Syrian mothers and
eliminate potentially harmful practices”, said Fatima,
a community health worker from Homs governorate.
“After years of turmoil affecting access to health care
for pregnant women and mothers, a programme like
this is needed more than ever.”

“Although pregnant women normally receive
antenatal care, the equally important period following
birth is sometimes neglected”, said Elizabeth Hoff,
the WHO Representative in Syria. “Syria is one of the
first countries in the Region to implement this WHO
programme.”

Maternal and newborn health

Childbirth is often filled with uncertainty, especially
for women living in conflict-affected or insecure
environments. WHO has launched a new programme
to help Syrian mothers manage this life-changing
event during pregnancy and after birth. The “caring
for the newborn at home” initiative guides all
mothers on the steps they and their families can take
to ensure their newborn children have a healthy start
in life.
Under the new programme, WHO-trained community
health workers make home visits to help mothers
during pregnancy and after childbirth. To begin with,
the programme is being introduced in areas that are
newly reconciled, or where there is limited access to
health care. It aims to reach 10 000 beneficiaries per
year.

Vaccination teams from the
Syria Immunization Group

In 2018, WHO’s office in Damascus supported 25
PHC centres that provided services for the integrated
management of childhood illnesses. WHO’s hub in
Gaziantep supported the running costs of 11 PHC
centres providing these services in north-west Syria.

CARING FOR THE NEWBORN
AT HOME

WHO launched a new initiative to improve newborn
care at home. The initiative was implemented in 35
villages in ten governorates.

Fathyah, from Homs governorate, says that she is very
happy to be part of the programme. “Unlike during
my previous pregnancies, health care workers have
been visiting me at home to help me take care of
my baby”, she said. “I’ve learned so much, including
how important it is to begin breastfeeding within half
an hour of birth. For the first time since the conflict
began, I feel that there are people who really care
about me and my family”, she added.

Mental health care in the community

Mental health
Rates of mental health disorders in Syria are
increasing12, but mental health services continue
to be in short supply. In north-west Syria, just over
a fifth of PHC clinics are able to offer basic mental
health care. Only two hospitals in north-west Syria
provide services for patients with severe mental
health disorders.
WHO is supporting the integration of mental health
and psychosocial support (MHPSS) services into
PHC centres across the country by training health
care and community workers and providing followup supervision. Training is based on WHO’s Mental
Health Gap Action Programme (mh-GAP), which aims
to increase the availability of mental health services
in low- and middle-income countries. Training
courses include considerations of gender equality and
counselling for victims of gender-based violence. In
March 2018, 12 physicians working in southern Syria
travelled to Jordan to attend a training workshop on
mh-GAP. Seventy health care professionals in northwest Syria completed an intensive six-month mh-GAP
training course. In total, 3465 health care workers
throughout Syria were trained on different aspects of
mental health care in 2018.

The stigma surrounding mental illness means that
many people are reluctant to seek help. In 2018,
WHO hosted a series of meetings with senior officials
in the Syrian ministries of health and education, other
UN agencies and national NGOs to mobilize efforts to
eliminate the stigma of mental illness and increase
patients’ access to care. WHO’s training programmes
and advocacy efforts have also helped dispel
misconceptions about mental health disorders. This
has resulted in changing attitudes towards mental
health patients and their families and helped reduce
the abuse and discrimination often suffered by these
patients.
Currently more than 520 PHC and secondary health
facilities and community centres in Syria are providing
mental health services. Psychiatric wards are now in
operation in three general hospitals in Damascus,
Hama and Lattakia that were previously rehabilitated
by WHO. WHO’s hub in Gaziantep is supporting acute
mental health services in Sarmada hospital in Idleb.
Gaziantep is also collaborating with hospital-based
psychiatrists in northern Aleppo who are treating
patients with severe mental health conditions. An
increasing number of mobile teams supported by
WHO include personnel trained in providing mental
health care.

Community mental health services are easily
accessible, lessen social exclusion, and are costeffective. Talking through problems and feelings with
trained psychosocial workers helps alleviate distress
and staves off more serious mental health disorders.
WHO is training and supporting staff in community
centres and mobile teams on basic mental health
interventions such as psychological first aid, family
and group counselling, and first-line support for
survivors of gender-based violence. In 2018, WHO
supported five family well-being community centres
in Aleppo, Al-Hasakeh and Homs governorates and
plans to establish at least 15 new community centres
in 2019.

A training curriculum for community health workers,
developed by WHO’s hub in Gaziantep, includes
a component on mental health. A total of 221
psychosocial workers were trained and are now able
to identify patients in need in the community and
refer them to specialized mental health services.
In 2018, WHO supported 32 NGO mental health
mobile teams working in areas such as eastern
Ghouta and south and north-west Syria that were the
focus of intense fighting. WHO’s hub in Gaziantep is
also supporting four mobile clinics that are providing
mental health care for patients in Idleb and northern
Aleppo. WHO-supported community centres and
mobile teams provided almost 84 000 MHPSS
interventions to people suffering from mental health
problems.

School mental health programme
The school mental health programme (SMHP),
launched in 2018, aims to train teachers, counsellors
and social workers in schools and community centres
on how to detect and help children suffering from
mental health disorders and refer them for specialist
care when necessary. A total of 25 counsellors from
different governorates attended training-of-trainers

workshops. They have since gone on to train 843
teachers and counsellors in 37 training courses
held in different governorates. WHO has contracted
specialized MHPSS professionals to provide on-thejob training and supervision to new trainees. Currently
more than 650 schools and community centres in 11
governorates are implementing the SMHP.

12
WHO estimates that one in 30 people in Syria is suffering from a severe mental health condition and at least one in five is suffering from a mild to
moderate mental health condition as a result of prolonged exposure to violence.

Noncommunicable diseases
According to the Syrian MOH, noncommunicable
diseases (NCDs) account for 45% of all deaths in
Syria13. Although the national NCD database tracks
only the number of patients with diabetes and
cancer, the MOH plans to expand it to include all
other NCDs. WHO has supported the development of
a system to monitor the quality of services in PHC
centres, using standard indicators for NCDs and other
health interventions. The project is being pilot-tested
and will be refined and expanded following the result
of the initial roll-out.
In 2018, WHO delivered 174 NCD kits to all
governorates. The kits contain medicines and medical
devices to manage the most common NCDs including

hypertension and cardiac conditions, diabetes and
endocrine disorders, chronic respiratory diseases, and
mental health and neurological conditions. In total,
the kits provided sufficient medicines and medical
devices to treat 435 000 NCD patients for up to one
year.
In early 2018, WHO’s hub in Amman launched a project
to improve the quality of NCD care in four health
care facilities in southern Syria. Amman delivered
medicines and supplies that enabled the centres to
provide more than 10 000 consultations, including for
232 mental health patients. WHO’s hub in Gaziantep
introduced a pilot project to improve NCD care in nine
health care facilities in north-west Syria.

Gender-based violence
In Syria, MHPSS services have been the entry point
for helping the victims of gender-based violence
(GBV). Through its MHPSS training courses, WHO
has trained more than 200 gynaecologists and 140
community psychosocial support workers on basic
psychological interventions for GBV survivors. Five
community well-being centres in Aleppo and Homs
are providing psychological support to people who
have been exposed to GBV.

Despite the above, services to treat GBV survivors
remain scarce. Syria is one of six countries selected
to pilot a WHO project to strengthen the health sector
response to GBV. The project aims to better integrate
GBV projects into WHO’s work by training WHO staff,
ensuring the availability of staff and supplies to
support GBV services, and improving coordination
among health sector partners. WHO will begin
implementing the project in early 2019.

Mandala community centre in the city of Aleppo
opened in 2017. Since then, it has become a busy
and popular hub for local residents, providing a mix
of services that include reproductive health care,
vocational training and mental health counselling,
including sessions tailored for survivors of genderbased violence. These services are offered at the
centre, through community visits and by mobile
teams working at IDP sites. Community visits help
ensure that elderly people are not isolated and that
they and their carers obtain the health care and
emotional support they need.

Dr Nabil Samarji, a mental health specialist based
in WHO’s sub-office in Aleppo, says that being able
to share and talk through traumatic experiences is a
powerful healing tool. He has trained the centre staff
on MHPSS and keeps in regular contact with them
through on-site visits and online coaching.

The centre promotes a holistic approach to
helping community members deal with traumatic
experiences. Three psychologists and three physicians
in the centre’s walk-in clinic provide MPHSS and
reproductive health services. A family-friendly space
allows parents to bring their children and interact
with other families.
The centre also offers vocational training, including
hairdressing, make up and cookery classes that are
designed to empower community residents and
help them find new meaning in their lives. They are
encouraged to undergo counselling at the same time.

“People like coming here. They feel empowered”,
said Dr Samarji. “This centre is a model of its kind. We
can learn a lot from its holistic approach and how it
has been a force for good in the community. When
people first come here, you observe how they are
withdrawn and afraid. In a relatively short space of
time, they become engaged in what they are doing.
You see how they interact with other people. The
difference is noticeable.”
WHO has delivered medicines and other supplies
and equipment to the centre, trained its staff on
mental health interventions and provided advice
and supervision. In 2018, the centre provided
1270 vocational services and 3822 mental health
consultations, including many to women who were
survivors of gender-based violence. More than 3000
reproductive health consultations were provided at
the centre and through mobile teams.

Reproductive health care
Sexual and reproductive health services are a critical
entry point to reach women and girls and help them
exercise their rights to reproductive health care. The
availability of local female health staff facilitates
the access of women and girls to these services and
opens the possibility for them to be referred to other
health and psychosocial services including those for
the survivors of gender-based violence. However,
female health professionals in Syria are severely
underrepresented. A recent WHO assessment
in southern Syria found that fewer than half of
obstetricians and gynaecologists were female and
that women accounted for only 18% of the overall
health workforce14.

A day in the life of a PHC centre
WHO supported the development of a national plan
to set strategic directions and actions to improve
reproductive and maternal health care in Syria over the
next five years. It trained approximately 500 health
care workers in nine governorates on reproductive
health care and supported the development of
reproductive health care guidelines for health care
workers and information booklets for communities.
NGOs supported by WHO delivered 1485 children by
normal delivery and 2242 by Caesarean section.
In 2018, WHO’s hub in Gaziantep delivered
reproductive health medicines and supplies and 10
kits to support reproductive health and obstetric and
newborn care in 19 health care facilities. The supplies
were sufficient to cover 16 640 treatment courses.

Community care
Community health workers play an important role in
remote and rural areas where access to health care is
extremely limited. They explain the basic preventive
measures that community members can take to
protect their health, and they identify patients who
need to be referred for specialist treatment. In north-

west Syria, where the distribution of PHC centres is
highly uneven15 and the number of doctors, nurses
and midwives is well below international standards16,
243 health workers trained by WHO provided these
services in their communities.

Referral systems
In 2018, WHO’s office in Damascus strengthened
referral services by improving diagnostic capacities in
PHC centres to minimize the need for unnecessary
referrals. WHO donated 36 ambulances and eight
mobile clinics to support referral services across the
country.
In north-west Syria, patients who required secondary
or tertiary care were referred through a network

of 62 PHC centres that was established to improve
coordination and support continuity of care for
patients. Referrals were supported through seven
mobile clinics, nine ambulances and 15 nonemergency vehicles. In collaboration with other
partners in north-west Syria, WHO also supported
50 ambulances to improve referrals during mass
casualty events.

Fardous PHC centre is located in a bustling, popular
neighbourhood in Eastern Aleppo. The area was badly
damaged in the fighting of 2016 and the PHC centre
was destroyed. Since the end of the conflict in Aleppo,
almost 50 000 people have returned to Fardous to
begin rebuilding their lives and their communities.
In March 2017, the centre re-opened following
extensive rehabilitation. Its team of 23 staff including
seven doctors and eight nurses and midwives offers
a full range of PHC services and sees around 300
patients per day. WHO has trained team members
on vaccination techniques, nutritional screening and
basic mental health interventions, and regularly
delivers medicines and other supplies to keep the
centre running.

42-year old Abo Ahmad has to be helped in by two
relatives. He has a high fever and severe abdominal
pain. The medical team suspects that Abo is suffering
from acute appendicitis and calls an ambulance to
take him to the nearest hospital.
Om Abdo, a mother of five children, comes seeking
family planning advice. She already has five children,
and her last two deliveries were by Caesarean section.
Her female physician implants an intrauterine device
and explains how to take care of it. She asks Om Abdo
to come back the following week for a check-up.

70-year old Hajeh Siham is next in line. She suffers
from severe arthritis and diabetes. Her doctor checks
her glucose levels and prescribes diabetes medicines
that she can collect from the centre’s pharmacy.

For 83-year old Hussein, the PHC centre is his only
hope. He has high blood pressure and cardiovascular
disease. All other PHC centres in the vicinity have
been destroyed or forced to close, and he cannot

afford the cost of treatment in private clinics. Thanks
to the centre and the supplies donated by WHO,
Hussein receives regular check-ups and obtains the
medicines he needs to keep him healthy.

Seven-year old Mahmoud comes to complete his course
of injections to treat his leishmaniasis. He is happy that
the painful lesion on his face has finally disappeared.
The team painstakingly maintains paper records so
that each patient can be tracked and receive followup care. New IDPs arrive every day, others leave, and
there is a constant flow of new patients. This high
patient turnover is challenging.

There is a steady stream of patients throughout the

some have more serious illnesses. By the time the
clinic closes at 3 p.m., the team has seen almost 300

Many patients are still waiting. The team checks to
be sure that none of them is seriously ill and asks
everyone to return the following day. The team
knows the following morning it will find another
queue of people waiting to be seen.

The clinic staff has seen many changes over the
past seven years. Before the conflict began, people
came to be treated for common illnesses. Now, the
team regularly sees patients suffering from diseases
such as malnutrition that were previously unheard
of. There has been a huge increase in the number
of patients with depression, disabilities and conflictrelated injuries. Many people are sleeping in the ruins
of their homes, where they are bitten by sandflies.
This has led to a dramatic increase in leishmaniasis.

to treat the growing numbers of patients with the
disease. WHO has donated leishmaniasis medicines
and bednets.
The clinic staff work at a relentless pace. They know
that without them, their patients would have no
access to health care. Mustafa, one of the doctors at
the centre, said “Seeing the happiness on Mahmoud’s
face when he is cured of leishmaniasis, and being
able to save the lives of patients like Abo Ahmad,
makes every day worthwhile.”

Hospitals and secondary health care facilities
Just over half of hospitals in Syria were fully
functioning in 2018. A quarter were working at
minimum capacity and had severe shortages of staff,
medicines and supplies, and the remainder were
closed altogether. Hospitals in Dar’a, Idleb, north-east
Syria and Quneitra were some of the worst affected.
In 2018, WHO’s office in Damascus delivered over
1.9 million treatment courses to support surgical,
intensive care, haemodialysis and cancer services. It
delivered 110 pieces of medical equipment including
CT scanners, incubators, ventilators, basic X-ray
equipment and haemodialysis machines to over 60
hospitals. WHO supported neonatal resuscitation
programmes in 34 hospitals in Syria.
Major gaps in secondary health care persisted in northwest Syria. Shortages were particularly severe in areas
near the Turkish border in Idleb, rural western Aleppo
and Afrin. Hospitals lacked specialized services for
patients with cancer and kidney disease. There were
not enough beds in intensive care units and those that
were available were taken up by trauma patients.
Equipment to support orthopaedic and reconstructive
surgery was outdated or malfunctioning and there
were shortages of other materials such as external
fixatures and plates. Centres treating patients with
kidney disease had severe shortages of supplies to

38

support haemodialysis sessions. Only two hospitals
were providing in-patient care for mental health
patients.
In 2018, WHO’s hub in Gaziantep delivered trauma
and surgical supplies (enough to cover 290 000
treatment courses) and other medicines and supplies
to hospitals in north-west Syria. Gaziantep supported
three facilities with operational costs throughout
2018 to ensure key facilities were providing services.
It also supported the running costs of the maternity
and paediatric hospital in Harem city, close to the
Turkish border. Harem is an area of high displacement
and a crossroads for many different populations. The
hospital provides 1200 outpatient consultations, 40
deliveries and 50 surgeries per month for a catchment
population of over 800 000 people.
At the end of March 2018, following the withdrawal
of a health partner from Dar’a in southern Syria, WHO
stepped in as the provider of last resort to support the
only operational blood bank in all of areas of southern
Syria controlled by non-state armed groups, thereby
ensuring access to safe blood and blood products for
trauma, emergency and routine surgery. Between
April and June, WHO supplied more than 1000 units of
blood to health care facilities in Dar’a and Quneitra.
In July 2018, the area came under the control of the
Syrian government.

Fifty-five-year-old Um Mohammad from Ar-Raqqa
governorate was diagnosed with breast cancer two
years ago. There are no public hospitals in the whole of
Ar-Raqqa governorate that can provide the treatment
she needs, so she has had to travel every two
weeks to the National Hospital in the neighbouring
governorate of Hama for chemotherapy. The journey
takes eight hours each way.
A tearful Um Mohammad said that the constant
travel, on top of her illness, had left her exhausted.
“I have been travelling to Hama for almost two years
now; I am on the verge of physical and financial
collapse.” Each trip costs Um Mohammad 10 000
Syrian pounds (the equivalent of US$ 23), a small
fortune considering that two thirds of the population
is living on less than $2 a day. “I am trying to get by
and borrowing money from friends and neighbours,
but they are all suffering too, and have no money to
spare.”

and forced to close, and its five other hospitals are
providing only limited services. The destruction of
health care facilities in neighbouring governorates
has exacerbated the situation. The hospital regularly
admits patients from Al-Hasakeh, Ar-Raqqa and
Deir-ez-Zor governorates. Its emergency department
alone receives 800 patients each day.
Ms Hoff said that WHO would continue to support
the hospital as much as possible. “Rehabilitating the
badly damaged National Hospital in Ar-Raqqa will be
costly and time-consuming. In the meantime, Hama
National Hospital provides the only hope for so many
people.”
Um Mohammad expressed her deep gratitude to the
doctors and nurses at the hospital. “They have been
amazing”, she said. “They’ve supported me and taken
care of me. When I needed to talk, they listened. I
will never forget what they have done for me.”

Um Muhammad is one of hundreds of thousands of
Syrian patients who have been badly affected by the
conflict. “Syria’s disrupted health system has led to
a public health catastrophe. Over half the country’s
hospitals are closed, and those that remain open are
working under severe pressure”, said Ms Elizabeth
Hoff, the WHO Representative in Syria. “People,
especially those in rural and conflict-affected areas,
are obliged to travel long distances to obtain health
care. Many of them simply cannot afford to make
the journey. In the absence of health care services,
chronic diseases such as diabetes and hypertension health conditions that would be treatable in normal
times - have become deadly.”
Hama National Hospital is one of many hospitals
that WHO is supporting through training staff and
delivering medicines, supplies and equipment to
maintain essential services. However, it is operating
under severe and increasing pressure. It is the only
public hospital that is providing specialized health care
in the whole of Hama governorate. Two other public
hospitals in the governorate have been destroyed

Trauma care
Good outcomes for injured patients require longterm personalized follow up which is extremely
challenging in times of war. In north-west Syria, only
45 out of 377 functioning health care facilities were
providing physical rehabilitation services. WHO’s
hubs in Amman and Gaziantep provided material
and financial support to a health partner managing
nine physical rehabilitation facilities (four in southern
and five in northern Syria17). By the end of 2018, this
partner had assisted over 15 270 patients including
more than 3200 children. However, this covered only
a fraction of needs.

WHO’s office in Damascus delivered 145 pieces of
medical equipment to strengthen hospitals’ surgical
and trauma care services as well as medicines and
supplies to treat over 470 000 trauma patients. It
also delivered prosthetic materials for more than 350
artificial limbs to two physical rehabilitation centres
in Damascus and Homs and supported the costs of
physiotherapy sessions. These two centres receive
patients from all over the country. Over 7600 patients
were supported with assistive devices, artificial limbs
and physiotherapy sessions, and 4170 health care
workers were trained on trauma care, first aid and
basic life support. WHO also rehabilitated a damaged
public physiotherapy centre in Homs.

In September 2018, WHO assessed the status of
trauma care services in Ar-Raqqa city and surrounding
areas. The lack of trauma care services in the city was
a critical concern because of the high risk of trauma
injuries due to the presence of tens of thousands of
landmines and other explosive remnants of war. The
assessment team found that there were no public
hospitals in Ar-Raqqa city that were able to perform
emergency life-saving surgery on trauma patients
before transferring them to more advanced facilities.
Two private hospitals had adequate facilities, but
most trauma patients could not afford the cost of
treatment. Based on the recommendations of the
report, WHO delivered emergency equipment and
supplies to strengthen the public hospital in
Al-Tabqa (within two hours’ driving distance of
Ar-Raqqa city). WHO also signed an agreement with
Al-Hekma private hospital (Al-Hasakeh governorate)

to cover the costs of patients admitted for trauma
and emergency care. As of the end of 2018, WHO was
in the process of negotiating a similar agreement
with Al-Teb Al-Hadeeth private hospital in Ar-Raqqa
city. WHO also delivered 11 blood bank refrigerators
to hospitals in the northeast.
Under a collaborative agreement between WHO and
the Bambino Gesù paediatric hospital in Rome, a
team of physicians from the hospital in Rome visited
Syria twice in 2018 to train their counterparts from
university hospitals in Damascus and Aleppo on
the latest techniques in laparoscopy, interventional
radiography,
paediatric
catheterization
and
paediatric intensive care. A team of Syrian specialists
subsequently visited Bambino Gesù hospital in Rome
to observe these techniques at first hand. They have
returned to train other specialists in their hospitals.

Amman, Jordan

Health objective 2:
Strengthen health sector coordination
and health information systems
Damascus
WHO’s office in Damascus co-leads a network of 100
health sector partners18. It leads strategic planning,
health advocacy and information management efforts
on behalf of the whole health sector. It also provides
technical advice to partners and ensures that critical
gaps in the emergency response are filled.
In 2018, Damascus worked closely with all health
sector partners to expand health care services
to newly accessible areas and other locations

where health needs were high. To prepare for
the shift from a response based on geographical
location to one based on severity of needs, health
partners completed approximately 50 health needs
assessments in different parts of the country. WHO
led work on health sector monitoring, evaluation and
accountability, and coordinated the development of
joint contingency and preparedness plans for disease
outbreaks and changing conflict dynamics.

WHO’s hub in Amman leads 25 health sector partners
comprising five UN agencies, 13 international and
seven local NGOs. It also co-leads three working
groups (one on mental health and psychosocial
support, one on community health workers and one
on quality and remote monitoring).
Amman is responsible for maintaining information
on the activities of all health sector partners (who
does what, where and when, or the 4Ws). The data
are used to monitor progress and plan and coordinate
overall health sector operations. In 2018, it produced
regular snapshots of health sector activities and
progress towards the health objectives set out in the
Humanitarian Response Plan for 2018.

Information management
WHO uses two main tools to monitor the health
situation in Syria.

Gaziantep, Turkey
WHO’s hub in Gaziantep leads over 100 health cluster
partners, 50 of which are implementing operations in
north-west Syria. The health cluster has established
technical working groups on reproductive health (led
by UNFPA), advocacy and communications, mental
health, trauma and rehabilitation. In 2018, Gaziantep

conducted several health needs assessments
and mapping exercises. It also coordinated the
health response to mass population displacements
from southern Idleb and eastern Ghouta and the
restructuring of health care services in Afrin.

In July 2018, cross-border health sector members
in Amman completed a survey assessing the
effectiveness of health sector coordination. The survey
results, published in October 2018, showed that
12 of 13 measures were rated good or satisfactory
and just one was rated unsatisfactory. The findings
highlighted the need for a dedicated information
management officer and better information-sharing
protocols. Partners also wanted the health cluster to
play a stronger role in setting norms for health care
service delivery and standards of care. The WHO hub
in Amman shared the survey results with other WHO
hubs working on the Syria response.

WHO’s Health Resources and Services Availability
Monitoring System (HeRAMS) tracks the functionality,
accessibility, infrastructure, services and staffing
levels of hospitals and health care facilities throughout
Syria. WHO uses this information to strengthen health
care facilities in the areas shown to be in greatest
need. In 2018, all of Syria’s 111 public hospitals and
almost all of its 1810 PHC centres reported to HeRAMS
on a regular basis.
WHO’s emergency disease surveillance systems
(EWARS, managed by Damascus and EWARN,

supported by Gaziantep) are key to detecting cases
of epidemic-prone diseases and halting their spread.
Over 1550 sentinel sites report to EWARS/N. Together,
these two systems have allowed WHO to monitor and
rapidly respond to disease outbreaks and alerts across
the country. Since the crisis began, WHO has trained
tens of thousands of health care workers on disease
surveillance and reporting, outbreak investigation
and response, laboratory diagnosis, infection
control and the case management of communicable
diseases. This has helped alleviate the impact of
badly disrupted health care services and has allowed
WHO and partners to detect and respond to disease
outbreaks, preventing their further spread.

most public hospitals had no capacity to treat
referred patients. WHO has taken several steps
to address these findings, including training
additional health care workers on mh-GAP. As a
result of this training, the number of IPDs who
received mental health counselling doubled
from 3385 in 2017 to over 7700 in 2018. WHO
also established a registry of patients with NCDs
that links them to health care facilities with
the capacity to treat them. Children in all four
camps were vaccinated against measles in 2018.
WHO has strengthened the referral system by
establishing standard timeframes within which
referrals must be completed. It has also signed
agreements with hospitals to cover the costs of
treating patients referred from the camps.

Health assessments
Health assessments are crucial to underpin WHO’s
work in Syria and ensure that its humanitarian
interventions are transparent, impartial and based on
demonstrated needs. In 2018, WHO completed the
following major assessments:
•

•

A study of patients’ views and experiences of
cancer care in 16 specialized health care facilities
in Syria. Preliminary findings of the study showed
that the level of services provided in the oncology
facilities was considered generally average
(by 45% of surveyed patients) or good (46%).
Similarly, emotional support provided was also
deemed to be average (36% of patients) or good
(31.4%), though a significant percentage still
encountered weak (14%) or very weak (9%)
support. Of significant concern, the majority of
patients (56%) reported that medicines were
not fully available, resulting in disruption of care
and a potentially negative impact on health
outcomes.
A comprehensive assessment (derived from
secondary data) of the status of health services
and populations in areas of southern Syria that
could be reached via cross-border activities from
Jordan. The assessment, carried out by WHO’s hub
in Amman, covered the period from late 2017 to
early 2018. It found that although communicable

disease accounted for only 1% of morbidities
among patients seeking health care, both health
professionals and community members cited
communicable diseases as one of their main
health concerns. Health data showed that typhoid
fever, watery diarrhoea and respiratory infections
were serious threats across the south. The review
also revealed that the number of reported cases
of suspected measles from Dar’a and Quneitra
in 2017 was six times greater than the number
reported in 2016. Based on the findings of the
assessment, the health sector’s subsequent
work plan focused on strengthening PHC, referral
pathways and disease surveillance and response.

•

An assessment of the health situation in four IDP
camps in north-east Syria. The assessment found
that two thirds of households were struggling
with mental health problems and one third had
at least one member who suffered from a chronic
illness but had limited access to treatment. The
measles vaccine coverage rate was not high
enough to ensure herd immunity. Referral
services in the camps were severely limited and

•

An assessment of health needs in Afrin, where
changes in political control in 2018 led to the
collapse of the local health system and the
displacement of 167 000 people. The assessment,
conducted by WHO’s hub in Gaziantep, found that
there were very few functioning PHC centres and
secondary health care facilities, and very limited
health care options for patients with tuberculosis
or leishmaniasis. Vaccination rates were low
and there were no facilities for patients with
disabilities or mental health problems. Referral
services were piecemeal and hampered by
lengthy clearance procedures, and there were
very few ambulances to transport patients to the
nearest hospitals in Aleppo. WHO is addressing
the assessment’s findings by strengthening PHC
centres and mobile clinics and re-establishing
routine immunization centres.

•

An assessment of the incidence of TB in northwest Syria and the treatment options for TB
patients. See page 54 of this report for more
information.

•

A comprehensive assessment of the availability
and readiness of all services in PHC centres across
Syria. The Service Readiness and Availability
Assessment (SARA) is conducted jointly by WHO

and the MOH every two years. The findings of
the 2018 survey will be used to support better
planning and monitoring, as well as strengthen
the national health information system.
Appendix 2 contains a list of assessments conducted
and/or assessment reports published in 2018.
WHO also developed the following assessment tools:
•

A tool to assess the health situation in IDP camps.
The tool has three components: 1) a household
questionnaire (to assess the health status of
households); 2) a health care facility questionnaire
(to assess the range and quality of services) and
3) an exit interview (to ascertain patients’ levels
of satisfaction with services provided). The tool
was pilot-tested in four IDP camps in north-east
Syria and subsequently refined. WHO will use the
tool to assess the health situation in other areas
that have been heavily affected by the conflict.

•

A tool specifically developed to assess the
health situation in shelters in eastern Ghouta
after government forces regained control of
the area. WHO assessed 1) the health situation
at community level (main causes of morbidity)
and 2) the services available in the health care
facilities supporting the shelter residents. It
used the findings to fill gaps in the emergency
response and ensure that its interventions were
meeting identified needs.

•

A tool to monitor patients’ and health care
providers’ satisfaction with the assistance
delivered by WHO. The tool comprises two
components: 1) interviews with managers and
staff of health care facilities and 2) patient
satisfaction interviews (at least three patients
per facility to be interviewed). WHO will use
the findings to further refine its assistance (e.g.,
by changing the types of medicines delivered
and conducting additional training courses for
staff in health care facilities supported by the
Organization).

Health objective 3:
Improve health system capacity for support
of continuity of care and strengthen
resilience and response to IDP movements
and disease outbreaks
disease surveillance, mh-GAP, trauma care and mass
casualty management.

Given the extent of damage to the public health
system, the need for national health NGOs will not
end with the return of peace to Syria. WHO/Syria’s
five-year strategy (2018-2022), sets out how the
Organization plans to support NGOs during the conflict
and beyond. Developed in consultation with NGOs,
this strategy describes how WHO will monitor and
assess NGOs’ performance and support them through
continuous professional training. Accompanying
guidelines provide NGOs with the guidance they
need to transform their strategies into annual plans
and establish mechanisms they can use to improve
their performance. WHO will use the data it gathers
to show national authorities the value of its NGO
partners and advocate for their continued financial
support.

WHO has initiated a comprehensive evaluation of
its training programme. Phase 1 (desk review) was
completed in late 2018. Phase 2 (interviews and field
evaluation) will be launched in early 2019.

Mobile clinics

Training
Around two thirds of skilled medical staff have left Syria
since the crisis began. WHO has trained hundreds of
thousands of health care workers to keep basic health
services afloat. These efforts have helped ensure that
millions of people areas continued to have access to
basic health care. In 2018, WHO trained 30 865 health
care workers on topics including infection control,

Working with NGOs
National NGOs continued to be WHO’s implementing
partners19. Working in insecure, hard-to-reach areas
that were inaccessible to UN agencies, they filled
gaps created by the disruption of national health care
services. By doing so, they ensured that millions of
Syrians continued to have access to basic health care.
For example, in April 2018, NGO teams and mobile

19

clinics were the first to arrive in areas of displacement
around eastern Ghouta, where they provided roundthe-clock services for more than 50 000 IDPs. NGOs
also provided essential health care services in south,
north-east and north-west Syria, all of which saw
massive waves of displacement in 2018.

Mobile clinics are literally a lifeline in areas that
are remote or hard to reach, or where health care
facilities have been destroyed. They are the only
source of health care for many people. Mobile teams
can go where they are needed and respond swiftly to
changing conditions on the ground. They are equipped
with separate rooms for examinations and medical
procedures, enabling health care services, especially
for women and girls, to be provided in privacy and
dignity and with respect for cultural sensitivities.
In 2018, WHO donated eight mobile clinics to underserved areas in Aleppo, Dar’a, north-east Syria,

WHO has hired an external organization to carry out
third party monitoring of the health care services
provided by its NGO partners, as well as their financial
and project management capacities. Thus far, 22
NGOs in seven governorates have been assessed.
Based on the results of these evaluations, WHO is
hiring a second external organization to help build
NGOs’ capacity by addressing compliance issues
and recommending actions to address identified
weaknesses and gaps.

northern rural Homs and Rural Damascus. WHO’s hub in
Gaziantep supported approximately 16 mobile clinics
per month, including four dedicated to mental health.
In response to massive population movements in the
northwest, WHO’s health partners deployed mobile
clinics at Qalaat Al Madiq, the main arrival site for
IDPs from other parts of Syria. Mobile teams carried
out basic health checks, provided mental health first
aid and vaccinated children and screened them for
malnutrition. Ill and wounded patients were referred
to hospitals and clinics in the area. WHO mapped
underserved areas, coordinated the deployment of
mobile clinics and delivered medicines and supplies.

WHO’s office in Damascus works with 52 health NGOs. Its hubs in Gaziantep and Amman work with 19 and four NGOs respectively.

More than 6 million IDPs in Syria are living in
overcrowded temporary settlements that lack
adequate water, sanitation and health care. Another
1.1 million people in hard-to-reach areas have only
limited access to basic services. Millions of children
who have been displaced or who live in besieged
or hard-to-reach areas have not been vaccinated. In
many areas of the country, vaccination teams have
not been able to reach children for several years. All
of these factors have created conditions that allow
for the rapid spread of disease.

In 2018, there were outbreaks of acute bloody
diarrhoea (in Deir-ez-Zor governorate), typhoid fever
(in Al-Hasakeh) and hepatitis A (in Aleppo and Dar’a
governorates). Rates of cutaneous leishmaniasis, a
disease which is endemic in Syria, rose sharply. These
diseases are almost always the result of unclean water
and poor sanitation. In addition, several outbreaks of
measles across the country reflected low vaccination
coverage rates among children.

Group introduced an extra dose of measles vaccine
at the age of seven months in addition to the two
recommended doses of measles, mumps and rubella
vaccine at 12 and 18 months. Perhaps as a result, the
number of laboratory-confirmed measles cases fell
sharply, from 1090 in the first few months of 2018 to
71 in the second half of the year.

In March 2017, an outbreak of vaccine-derived
poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) disease emphasized the
dangers of disrupted immunization services. (Cases
of vaccine-derived polio are rare and occur when
vaccination coverage rates are low; if a population
is fully immunized, it will be protected against both
vaccine-derived and wild poliovirus disease.) The
cVDPV2 outbreak occurred close to the border with
Iraq and in an area with continuous population
movements; it raised fears that the virus would
spread into neighbouring countries. The Emergency

Measles
A total of 24 004 suspected cases of measles were
reported in 2018, of which 1530 were laboratoryconfirmed. This represents an increase of 104 %
compared with the previous year. Most cases were
from the northern governorates, where health
care services have been severely disrupted. WHO
supported a national vaccination campaign that was
implemented in two phases. Over 2.6 million children
were vaccinated against measles in the course of this
campaign, which, in addition to targeting areas under
government control, reached areas in south and northeast Syria that were under the control of non-state
armed groups. WHO’s hub in Gaziantep supported

Disease outbreaks and other communicable diseases

Trend analysis of suspected measles cases in 2018
(data taken from EWARS/N)

(IHR) issued temporary recommendations to help
prevent the further spread of the disease.
WHO led efforts to halt the spread of the virus. In
October 2018, WHO’s Outbreak Assessment team
concluded that the transmission of cVDPV2 had been
interrupted. No new cases of cVDPV2 disease have
been reported since September 2017, but Syrian
children are vulnerable to re-infection20. Syria remains
subject to the temporary recommendations issued by
the emergency committee of the IHR.

Cutaneous leishmaniasis
Acute bloody diarrhoea
In May 2018, health partners reported outbreaks of
acute bloody diarrhoea in two locations in Deir-ez-Zor
governorate. Access to these highly insecure areas
has been extremely difficult for the past several
years, leading to a serious deterioration in basic
infrastructure including the water supply network. As
of 30 September 2018, 784 people had fallen ill and
12 had died.
WHO and UNICEF conducted a joint field mission to
the affected areas. Laboratory tests indicated that
E. coli infection was the predominant cause of the
outbreak. An analysis of water samples taken from
the nearby Euphrates river showed E. coli levels
above accepted standards. The team found that many
people were swimming in the river or using river
water for washing, drinking and cooking. To stem
the immediate outbreak, the team distributed more

than 572 000 chlorine tablets to 35 860 households.
WHO distributed approximately 145 000 cubic metres
of water to around 70 000 people in 13 villages in
the most affected areas. (One cubic metre of water
is enough to cover the daily needs of one family.)
WHO and UNICEF organized community meetings
to brief residents about the importance of washing
hands thoroughly with soap and water, treating
household water through chlorination, boiling and
sieving, and immediately treating sick children with
oral rehydration salts. WHO and UNICEF are expanding
these water safety measures to neighbouring areas.
As a longer-term measure, both agencies are working
jointly to chlorinate drinking water sources, tankers
and reservoirs in the main outbreak areas and other
villages along the Euphrates valley. The number of
cases had declined to seasonal standards by the
middle of July.

Typhoid
Between 1 March and 9 June 2018, 1219 suspected
cases of typhoid fever in Al Hol camp, Al-Hasakeh
governorate were reported to the disease surveillance
system (EWARS/N). WHO delivered medicines to
hospitals in the area to help them treat patients
admitted with the disease. WHO and partners
distributed soap and water purification sachets to
households and explained the simple measures they
could take to reduce the risk of the disease. All water
tankers in the camp were sterilized and jerry cans
were discarded and replaced. By early April 2018 the
number of cases had dropped sharply, in large part
due to effective control and response measures.

Rates of cutaneous leishmaniasis rose sharply in
2018 (71 484 cases from January to November
2018 compared with 52 223 for the whole of 2017).
Almost all cases were reported from the six northern
governorates21, where the disease is endemic. The
increase can be attributed to continuous population
movements, disrupted control programmes and the
poor shelter and sanitation in camps. (Many people
are forced to sleep on the ground, where they come
into direct contact with the sandfly that causes
leishmaniasis.) The lack of funding for vector control
measures, compounded by a worldwide shortage of
medicines to treat leishmaniasis, has exacerbated
the problem and led to a rise in the incidence of the
disease.
In 2018, WHO delivered 170 000 vials of meglumine
antimoniate (a treatment for leishmaniasis) and
63 000 bed nets to Syria’s north-eastern governorates.
WHO also donated 15 000 vials of meglumine
antimoniate and related supplies to an international
NGO that works to combat leishmaniasis in Syria.

WHO

Hepatitis A
In August 2018, a separate outbreak of typhoid
fever was detected in Areesha camp, Al-Hasakeh
governorate. WHO delivered supplies and medicines
to the camp and supported an awareness-raising
campaign that was conducted by four health
education teams. The teams visited five other IDP
camps in the governorate to brief residents about
the basic measures they could take to prevent
waterborne diseases.

In late August 2018, cases of suspected hepatitis A
in rural areas of Dar’a governorate were detected
through EWARS/N. Over the next three months, 958
cases were reported, of which six were laboratory
confirmed. The Directorate of Health delivered
chlorine tablets in the affected areas and supported
health awareness campaigns. By the end of the year,
there had been a significant decrease in the number
of reported cases. WHO and UNICEF are monitoring
the quality of drinking water in the area and
supporting the cleaning and chlorination of drinking
water sources.

Bed nets procured by WHO are distributed in
Aleppo.

A separate outbreak of hepatitis A in northern rural
Aleppo affected mostly schoolchildren under the age
of 15. Between July and November, 660 suspected
cases were reported of which 12 were laboratory
confirmed. An analysis of the water in wells, tanks
and reservoirs in the area showed that seven out of
15 sources tested were contaminated, including two
in schools. WHO distributed information brochures
on how to prevent hepatitis A and prepared
recommendations on the basic measures to be taken
to maintain clean water supplies. These included
cleaning all wells and regularly chlorinating water
sources. The information gathered by WHO was
shared with colleagues from the Water, Sanitation
and Hygiene sector for immediate action.

Tuberculosis

HIV/AIDS

Rate of tuberculosis (TB) in Syria are estimated to
be on the rise (15.8 per 100 000 people in 2017
compared with 13 per 100 000 people in 2013). In July
2018, the national control programme in Damascus
and health partners in north-west Syria reported that
3264 patients had registered for TB treatment; this
suggests that the notification rate is 18 per 100 000
people.

WHO has developed TB recommendations for the
MOH. They include deploying teams with mobile
X-ray machines to screen all vulnerable populations,
especially in areas of displacement, and improving
TB indicators to help identify those at increased risk
of catching the disease. The government is gradually
re-establishing TB services; ten out of 14 national TB
centres are now open and fully functioning.

Since the crisis began, almost half of Syria’s TB
centres have closed, and those that remain open do
not always provide the full range of services. The
national system for notifying new cases of TB has
collapsed in some areas; Aleppo governorate, which
used to account for the highest number of TB patients
in Syria, has reported very few new cases since the
crisis began. Similarly, little information on the status
of TB is available in the north-eastern governorates.

In July 2018, health partners in north-west Syria
reported that 605 patients had registered for TB
treatment. Based on current TB rates in Syria, the real
number of people with TB is likely to be much higher.
Because evidence shows that for every undiagnosed
TB case about 10-15 persons can acquire the disease,
urgent action is required to increase detection rates
and provide treatment.

In collaboration with the MOH and with financial
support by the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis
and Malaria, WHO conducted active case finding for
TB in 13 governorates. Over a 47-day period in August
and September, 177 teams visited 38 136 families
(two thirds of whom were displaced or refugees) and
took sputum samples from 583 people suspected of
having the disease. When samples tested positive
for TB, the diagnosis was confirmed by chest X-ray.
Among 846 individuals suspected of having TB22, 96
were confirmed. Although this finding was based
on surveillance of specific population groups, it
suggested that the incidence rate for TB could be
as high as 50 per 100 000 population. All patients
diagnosed with TB were immediately enrolled in
treatment programmes.

An assessment of the status of TB care in north-west
Syria carried out by Gaziantep showed there were
severe shortages of TB drugs, use of expired drugs,
weak lab tests (no single centre was able to perform
TB cultures) and lack of qualified staff. In response,
WHO’s hub in Gaziantep prepared a strategy to
tackle TB in northern Syria. The strategy establishes
a system to secure a sustainable supply of medicines
for TB patients, complemented by increased medical
supervision to limit treatment non-compliance and
reduce the risk of developing multi-drug resistance.
Gaziantep is assessing the quality of care in TB
treatment centres in northern Syria and has procured
sufficient quantities of TB drugs to treat all known TB
patients.

22
The teams did not collect sputum samples from all 846 individuals. For example, it is difficult to collect sputum samples from children and so the
diagnosis is made based on clinical symptoms and X-rays.

54

Population displacement, overcrowded households,
unprotected sex and unsafe blood transfusion and
surgical procedures all increase the risk of HIV. In
collaboration with the International Organization for
Migration and the MOH, and with financial support
by the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and
Malaria, WHO is working to strengthen HIV prevention
among most-at-risk populations in Syria. In 2018,
WHO supported the active case finding of patients
with HIV/AIDS in 13 governorates. Fifty teams visited
15 000 families (over half of whom were displaced)
over a 30-day period. Out of a total of 14 352 HIV
rapid tests performed, three were positive and were

confirmed by laboratory diagnosis of blood samples.
All three patients confirmed as having the disease
were immediately enrolled in treatment programmes.
Based on this experience, WHO developed a set of
recommendations. They include a continuation of
active case finding in all areas and the development
of indicators to help identify those who are at greater
risk of HIV infection. In the meantime, the national
HIV control programme will use the initial findings
to develop a plan to control the further spread of HIV
by improving HIV detection rates and implementing
effective control measures.

Rehabilitation
WHO supported the rehabilitation of two PHC centres
in Aleppo and one PHC centre in Rural Damascus23.
The reopening of the centres in Aleppo comes at a
crucial time. People who fled the city at the height
of the conflict are slowly returning to their homes,
and the demand for health care is steadily increasing.
Between them, the two centres will serve a caseload
of more than 27 000 people who will benefit from
comprehensive, free-of-charge health care services.

The third centre in Rural Damascus serves more than
3800 patients.
WHO also supported the minor rehabilitation of Jib
Al-Jandali PHC and physiotherapy centre in Homs. The
centre provides physiotherapy for amputees, patients
with artificial limbs and other people with movement
difficulties. It has a caseload of approximately 50 000
patients.

WHO

WHO also supported the rehabilitation of a TB
treatment centre in Aleppo. This centre was selected
as a priority because TB rates in Syria are growing and
because the governorate has traditionally accounted
for the highest number of TB cases in the country.

WHO’s hub in Gaziantep supported the minor
rehabilitation and equipping of nine secondary health
care facilities in north-west Syria. These facilities
cover a catchment population of approximately
800 000 people.

Rehabilitation work on the emergency department of
the Paediatric Hospital in Damascus continues and is
scheduled to be completed by May 2019.

WHO has prepared a list of the health care facilities
to be rehabilitated in 2019, based on the information
generated by HeRAMS and the severity of needs
in under-served areas. The number of health care
facilities rehabilitated will depend on the availability
of funds.

WHO’s nutrition programme, launched in 2014, has
continued to expand. A total of 755 PHC centres and 48
private clinics in 13 governorates24 are now offering
nutritional surveillance services for children under
five years of age. In 2018, they screened 917 943
children for malnutrition; those who were severely
malnourished were referred for specialized treatment
in outpatient therapeutic centres supported by
UNICEF and WFP. A total of 906 malnourished children
with medical complications were referred in 2018,
compared with 1023 for 2017. This decrease can be
partly attributed to better screening and preventive
measures such as the Infant and Young Child Feeding
Programme and the Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative.
All nutritional surveillance and stabilization centres
are now reporting through the national nutritional
surveillance system. WHO delivered equipment and
supplies, including new and improved therapeutic
treatments, to support 33 stabilization centres.
WHO is also supporting the nutritional screening of
children in IDP camps in Aleppo, Dar’a, Homs, Rural
Damascus and north-east Syria. A total of 186 000
children were screened, of whom 6000 were found to
be severely malnourished and referred for treatment.

Global acute malnutrition rates remained more
or less stable compared with 2017, and mortality
rates for hospitalized children decreased (2.4% in
2018 compared to 2.6 in 2017), due in part to the
implementation of updated WHO guidelines on
managing hospital patients.

Nutritional screening was expanded to Ar-Raqqa and Deir-ez-Zor governorates in 2018.

child mortality. In emergencies, the implementation
of the IYCF is critical to ensure child survival and
development.

Adequate supplies of clean water are essential to
maintain health and reduce the risk of epidemics,
especially in overcrowded settings such as IDP camps.
Water is essential for cooking, drinking and cleaning.
If people do not have adequate supplies of clean
water, they will obtain it from sources that are likely
to be contaminated. In the first six months of 2018,
WHO assessed the quality of water in Aleppo, Homs,
north-west and north-east Syria and Rural Damascus.
A total of 1865 ground wells, 521 reservoirs and
over 190 jerry cans were tested. WHO worked with
national authorities and partners to disinfect polluted
water and make it safe to use.

In 2018, 592 health care workers were trained on
IYCF. WHO estimates that they will go on to provide
counselling to approximately 162 000 people per
year.

The key to preventing diseases from unclean
water is to ensure that water is of a high quality
when consumed, not just after treatment or at
water distribution points. In 2018, working in close

Infant and young child feeding programme
The infant and young child feeding programme (IYCF),
jointly developed by WHO and UNICEF, aims to create
an environment that will enable mothers, families
and other caregivers to make informed choices about
optimal feeding practices for infants and young
children. The IYCF emphasizes the importance of
breastfeeding as the preventive intervention with
potentially the single largest impact on reducing

Water, sanitation and hygiene
(WASH) objective:
Support water, sanitation and sewage systems
collaboration with national authorities, WASH sector
partners and local communities, WHO procured over
600 000 chlorine tablets for distribution to households
and chlorinated approximately 200 000 cubic metres
of water in 22 000 water tankers that were used to
supply villages and IDP camps in north-east Syria. One
cubic metre of water is enough to cover the needs of
one family per day.
WHO also works to improve water and sanitation
facilities in hospitals to protect the health of patients
and medical staff. This includes measures to ensure
the safe disposal of medical waste. In the first six
months of 2018, WHO strengthened the water supply
systems of five hospitals in Aleppo, Damascus and
Deir-ez-Zor and provided 450 bins to store and
transport medical waste in hospitals in Aleppo.

Baby-friendly hospital initiative
The Baby-friendly hospital initiative (BFHI) was
launched by WHO and UNICEF in 1991. The BFHI is
a global effort to implement practices that protect,
promote and support breastfeeding. In 2018, WHO
and UNICEF issued new guidance on promoting
breastfeeding in maternity hospitals and other health
care facilities.

58

In 2018, staff in 38 hospitals in Syria were trained
on the BFHI. WHO estimates that they will go on to
counsel approximately 50 000 new mothers per year.

MANAGING WHO’S OPERATIONS
Whole-of-Syria internal coordination
The “Whole-of-Syria” (WoS) approach allows
humanitarian agencies to deliver cross-border
assistance from neighbouring countries to people in
parts of Syria that are not accessible from Damascus.
WHO’s main office in Damascus and its hubs in
Gaziantep (Turkey) and Amman (Jordan) work
under a common WoS framework, with operational
adjustments as the situation evolves.
Given the complexity and fast-evolving nature of
the Syrian conflict, close coordination among the
WoS offices and hubs is essential. Staff from all three
offices meet regularly to review and adapt operations,
conduct strategic planning and ensure an integrated
approach based on a common understanding of

WHO’s aims and objectives. Senior staff from WHO’s
headquarters and its regional office in Cairo also
attend these meetings.

Monitoring and evaluation

Following changes in political control in 2018, WHO’s
operations in southern Syria and northern rural Homs,
managed by Amman and Gaziantep respectively,
were transferred to its office in Damascus. Conversely,
Damascus handed over responsibility for some areas
of north-west Syria to WHO’s hub in Gaziantep.
Damascus is now responsible for an area covering
approximately 13.9 million people, while Gaziantep
is responsible for an area covering approximately 4
million people.

WHO continues to improve its monitoring capacity.
It issues monthly reports documenting progress
measured against almost 70 key performance
indicators. Other monthly reports include a “Who
Does What, Where and When” (4Ws) report for the
health cluster and a report documenting attacks on
health care in Syria. All WoS hubs contribute to WHO’s
global database documenting attacks on health care.
WHO also issues epidemiological bulletins derived
from aggregated EWARS/N data and regular reports
on the status of health care facilities across Syria.
Throughout the year, WHO focal points undertook
monitoring visits, including in hard-to-reach areas.
These visits allowed WHO to evaluate local needs and
target its interventions accordingly. Focal points in
most governorates monitored the use of equipment
delivered by WHO through follow-up visits to
hospitals, obtaining feedback from both patients (to
find out if they benefited from the equipment) and
health care staff (to obtain their views on the quality
of the equipment). The focal points also visited health
care facilities each month to collect HeRAMS data and
train health care staff on how to complete HeRAMS
questionnaires.
WHO’s office in Damascus has hired an external
organization to conduct third party monitoring of the
Organization’s NGO partners in Syria. Thus far, the
third party monitor has assessed the financial and
technical capacity of 22 NGOs in seven governorates.
WHO’s monitoring and evaluation officer works
closely with the third party monitor to track the
status of each assessed NGO and ensure the findings
are addressed on a timely basis.

60

WHO focal points assessed the quality of active case
finding for TB and HIV/AIDS. They accompanied
MOH case finding teams and completed assessment
questionnaires that were prepared by WHO’s office
in Damascus. The completed questionnaires were
analysed by staff in Damascus and the findings were
shared with the MOH.
WHO’s NGO partners submitted detailed monthly
reports listing the number of patients treated and
the services provided. WHO cross-checked this
information through site visits to NGO facilities and
phone calls to beneficiaries, asking them to confirm
that they had received the services and to assess
their quality.
WHO’s hub in Gaziantep hired an external
organization to monitor and assess its medical supply
chain. The initial findings showed that many WHO
warehouses were short-staffed and lacked proper
temperature control mechanisms. Only two out of
41 had secure storage for psychotropic substances.
There were shortages of essential medicines in many
PHC centres and hospitals. Based on these findings,
Gaziantep prepared guidelines for the management
of pharmaceutical products, as well as standard
operating procedures for eight separate steps in
the supply chain. Gaziantep plans to strengthen
monitoring, supervision and training activities to
improve the supply chain.

-----------------------Page 32 End-----------------------

Promoting gender equity
WHO includes gender and age in its data collection
activities because women, girls, boys and men differ
in their needs for health care services in IDP camps
and other settings. WHO’s national NGO partners are
required to provide data disaggregated by gender and
age in their reports to WHO. Given the male/female
imbalance among health care workers in Syria, WHO
advocates for the inclusion of female health workers
in mobile teams, clinics and community centres in
order to improve the access of women and girls to
health care services.
WHO monitors patient and health care provider
satisfaction with health care services by allowing
them to report on any gender discrimination they
have encountered. This helps to ensure a gender
perspective on the quality of services delivered. WHO
encourages female staff to attend training workshops
by providing special incentives; for example, WHO
pays for the travel of an accompanying family

member so that women do not have to travel alone.
WHO is a member of the UN country team’s network
on the prevention of sexual exploitation and abuse
(PSEA). The network is developing a common
approach to integrating PSEA considerations in all
planning and programming, including developing
community-based mechanisms to report on PSEA.
All of WHO’s implementing partners are required to
sign a code of conduct that includes PSEA provisions.
Agreements signed with partners include a clause
obliging them to take measures to prevent and
respond to any violations of the code of conduct by its
employees and other persons who perform services
under the agreement. Implementing partners
are also required to promptly report confirmed or
suspected violations of WHO’s policies including its
code of ethics and professional conduct and its policy
on whistleblowing and protection against retaliation.

Procurement is based on Syria’s Essential Medicines
List (EML), which is updated at the beginning of
each year. WHO, the MOH and the Ministry of Higher
Education jointly determine the items to be included
in the list based on a review of consumption patterns
and morbidity trends over the preceding year.

The Organization continues to require the prior
approval of the MOH to withdraw supplies from
WHO warehouses and deliver them to PHC centres
and hospitals throughout Syria. The lengthy process
to obtain these approvals is now the most important
factor hampering WHO’s supply chain.
To reflect the increasing prevalence of NCDs
worldwide, WHO has recently developed standard
kits to treat patients with NCDs. These kits are
designed to meet initial primary health care needs in

Medicines are prioritized for procurement whenever
funds become available. The EML also includes
essential equipment whose procurement is based on
a review of hospitals’ needs. Information generated
by HeRAMS provides the basis for this review.
WHO has expanded the storage capacity and range
of stocks in its Dubai warehouse. Emergency kits and
supplies stored in Dubai can now be sent to Syria
within as little as four weeks.
Lengthy procurement delays have been greatly
shortened by establishing long-term agreements
between WHO and several newly approved suppliers.
WHO is now able to place orders directly with these

WHO’s value for money approach is built around
economy, efficiency, effectiveness, equity and ethics.
The Organization bulk purchases most medicines and
supplies to ensure the best possible price and applies
strict safeguards to ensure that medicines and
pharmaceutical products meet acceptable standards.
In Syria, it monitors all equipment, supplies and
services delivered to verify that medicines reach
intended beneficiaries and that equipment and
services provided are of high quality. Its NGO
partners are selected based on a comprehensive
review of their proven capacity to deliver in difficult
environments. WHO has invested heavily in training
its NGO partners. Health NGOs will be essential for the
foreseeable future as the country gradually stabilizes
and begins the long process of rebuilding its health
system.

emergencies. Each kit contains enough medicines and
medical devices to treat 10 000 NCD patients for three
months. WHO procured 177 kits for its operations in
Syria in 2018 (174 were delivered, three remain in
WHO warehouses)25.
The dire conditions in Idleb governorate have meant
that tens of thousands of IDPs have been sleeping on
the ground. In response, for the first time ever WHO’s
hub in Gaziantep procured anti-venoms to treat snake
and scorpion bites. Conditions in Idleb governorate
also led to increasing rates of leishmaniasis.
However, there is a worldwide shortage of medicines
to treat this disease, and WHO was unable to procure
sufficient quantities of anti-leishmaniasis treatments.
TB medicines in north-west Syria were of low quality,
highlighting the need for these medicines to be
procured by WHO. WHO also encountered delays in
procuring pneumococcal, anti-rabies and flu vaccines,
largely because of global shortages of these vaccines.

Value for money

Procurement trends
The procurement and delivery of medicines, supplies
and medical equipment continued to be a major
part of WHO’s operations. In 2018, these activities
accounted for USD 28.8 million, or 40% of WHO’s
overall expenditures. Medicines and supplies are
stored in WHO warehouses in six locations (five in
Syria and one in Turkey), ready to be deployed as
needs arise.

suppliers, obviating the need for time-consuming
bidding procedures. However, to be eligible to supply
goods for Syria, suppliers must be both approved by
WHO and registered with the MOH. WHO is working to
solve this problem by identifying additional suppliers
that can receive WHO approval and by having its
existing and potential suppliers approved by the
MOH. Both processes remain slow and cumbersome.

WHO focuses on reaching the people who are
demonstrably most in need, based on an analysis
of the severity of the health situation and health
needs in all 270 sub-districts of Syria. Lastly, WHO’s
emergency operations in Syria are based on the
four humanitarian principles of humanity, neutrality,
impartiality and independence.
A review of WHO’s value for money strategy in
Syria showed that 75% of assessed interventions
demonstrated high impact against low investment,
leading to better health outcomes for beneficiaries.
Seven WoS staff (three from Damascus, two from
Gaziantep and two from Amman) were trained on
WHO’s value for money approach in 2018.

As stability returns to certain locations, we will work
to support the resilience of health care services in
these areas. To allow us to do this, some basic
conditions have to be met:
•

We need sustained access to hard-to-reach areas
to assess health care services and people’s health
needs, and help rebuild basic services.

Strengthen our evidence-based approach and
focus our response on areas where the severity
scale is 3 and above.

must be protected and made safe from attacks.

Support health policies that are non-discriminatory
and that target the most urgent needs of the
population, e.g., those with lifelong disabilities
as a result of the conflict.
Advocate for the sanctity of health care facilities,
patients and health workers, and take account
of human rights and protection issues when
delivering assistance.
Engage at the community level to help ensure
that civil society has a say in the rebuilding of the
health system.
Continue to deliver assistance in a transparent,
equitable,
non-discriminatory,
respectful,
dignified and non-politicized manner.

•

We need faster, more efficient approvals from
national and local authorities to allow us to deliver
health supplies to people in all parts of Syria,
based on transparent, impartial assessments of
needs.

On behalf of our health partners, we will continue to
advocate at the highest diplomatic levels for solutions
that will allow us to overcome the above constraints.
In 2019, as we support the country’s efforts to begin
the long process of rehabilitating the health care
system, the support of our humanitarian donors will
be needed more than ever.

Our work in Syria would not have been possible
without the continued generous support of our
humanitarian donors.
It would not have been possible without the strong
collaboration of our health partners, including our
sister UN agencies and international health NGOs.
It would not have been possible without the devoted
efforts of the Syrian Arab Red Crescent and more than
50 national health NGOs working in Syria.

It would not have been possible without the energy
and commitment of WHO staff in Syria, Amman and
Gaziantep who pulled together on the emergency
response.
Most of all, it would not have been possible without
the dedicated health care workers throughout Syria,
who continued to save countless lives while putting
their own at risk on a daily basis. In 2018, 17 health
care staff were killed and 44 were injured in the
course of carrying out their daily duties.
