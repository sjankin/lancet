FOREWORD

The year 2016 was a historic one for both IOM and the international migration community as a whole. On
19 September, at the United Nations Summit for Refugees and Migrants, held in New York, IOM joined
the United Nations family, cementing our role as the “UN Migration Agency”, and the process to develop
a global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration was launched. These closely related events tell
us two things: first, that, at long last, migration has been placed on the international affairs agenda; and
second, that IOM has an essential role to play in the global governance of the issue.

Sadly, however, these encouraging developments occurred against a sombre background of population
instability and humanitarian emergencies. The ongoing war in the Syrian Arab Republic, conflicts in fragile
States in many parts of the world and natural disasters – such as earthquakes, droughts, floods and
environmental degradation due to climate change – were all sources of mass forced displacement. Anti-
migrant sentiment and xenophobia were all too frequently also part of the picture.

This Annual Report for 2016 offers an overview of IOM’s responses not only to these situations, but also
to the broader challenge confronting the international community, namely the development of a broad-
based and cooperative approach to migration governance.

The Organization that was created 65 years ago, in the aftermath of the Second World War, now has
166 Member States, and its global presence has expanded to over 400 locations, with 90 per cent of its
staff deployed in the field. Two essential values of the Organization remain unchanged, however: our
dedication to improving and upholding the dignity, safety and well-being of migrants the world over and
our commitment to work in partnership with our Member States. These values are upheld in each of our
projects, whether they address labour migration, humanitarian crises, refugee resettlement, migrant
health or the specific policy or programmatic needs of Member States.

Following the pattern established for the previous year, the Annual Report for 2016 highlights the key
achievements of the Organization during the reporting period, using the Migration Governance
Framework as a grid of analysis. The Annual Report should be read in conjunction with the Organizational
Effectiveness Report for 2016 (see document S/20/6), issued for the Twentieth Session of the Standing
Committee on Programmes and Finance.

NEW REPORTING STRUCTURE

1.         Similarly to the previous report, the Annual Report for 2016 highlights the key achievements of
the Organization during the reporting period in a results-oriented way, and groups IOM activities according
to the three principles and three objectives of the Migration Governance Framework (shown in the
illustration below). The aim of this structure is to provide a better representation of – and insight into –
what the Organization has achieved, compared with previous forms of annual reporting. A separate report
is being issued for the Twentieth Session of the Standing Committee on Programmes and Finance on the
organizational effectiveness of IOM (see document S/20/6). One hundred and seventy IOM offices
around the globe completed the institutional questionnaire designed in 2016 for this corporate reporting.


                                  Migration Governance Framework




2.       The Migration Governance Framework forms the basis of IOM’s regional and country strategies.
An institutional results framework was designed to identify, track and report on results against the
Migration Governance Framework and is being piloted throughout the Organization. The structure of the
present report has been adapted accordingly.


IOM – A GLOBAL ORGANIZATION

IOM celebrates 65 years of changing migrants’ lives

3.         The Organization was created 65 years ago in the aftermath of the Second World War, at a time
when no government acting alone could help survivors of the war who sought an opportunity to resume
their lives in freedom and with dignity. The first incarnation of IOM was created to resettle refugees and
move the “surplus population of Europe”, namely the large numbers of people with little or no economic
prospects or possibilities to earn a livelihood, to places that could provide greater opportunities during
the post-war period.

4.        Over the years, IOM grew from being an entity with a focus on migrant and refugee resettlement
to becoming the world’s leading intergovernmental organization dedicated to the well-being, safety and
engagement of migrants. During this time, the Organization’s activities increasingly responded to
humanitarian needs stemming from human-induced crises and natural disasters, and IOM became a key
actor in crisis response, assisting governments, communities and individuals to build resilience, to
prevent, limit and mitigate displacement where possible, and to work towards longer-term recovery and
development goals.

5.       The Organization now has 166 Member States, and its global presence has expanded to over
400 field locations. With over 90 per cent of its staff deployed in the field, IOM has become a lead
responder to the world’s most severe humanitarian emergencies. As one in every seven people is a
migrant – be they a refugee, or internally displaced person, a student, a migrant worker or a professional
who moves between international postings – IOM continues to uphold the beliefs that brought the
Organization into being 65 years ago: that migration builds resilience, and that migrants are agents of
change and development.

IOM enters the United Nations system

6.       On 19 September 2016, at the Summit for Refugees and Migrants, an agreement was signed
by the Secretary-General of the United Nations and the IOM Director General to bring IOM into the
United Nations system. This was a significant milestone for IOM and the United Nations and the
culmination of the 65-year partnership between the two organizations. The path to that outcome had
involved significant planning and engagement between the secretariats of both organizations, and
engagement at all levels with IOM Member States and non-member States.

7.       This engagement had intensified in 2015. Following the adoption of IOM Council Resolution
No. 1309 of 24 November 2015, in which Member States requested the Director General to formally
approach the United Nations and develop with it proposals on how to improve the legal basis of the
relationship between the two organizations, immediate steps were taken to inform the Secretary-General
of the decision and to launch formal discussions. The IOM Administration met on several occasions with
its United Nations counterparts to discuss the legal and financial implications of various options for
strengthening the relationship between IOM and the United Nations. Several briefings were also convened
with Member States in Geneva and New York to provide updates on the content of discussions and ensure
informed government oversight.

8.        For its part, the United Nations also began a formal process to consider the issue of
IOM–UN relations and added an item on that topic on the agenda of the seventieth session of the General
Assembly, through which the Secretary-General was mandated to negotiate a relationship agreement with
IOM. On 25 July 2016, following the endorsement of the draft Agreement concerning the Relationship
between the United Nations and the International Organization for Migration by the IOM Council on
30 June 2016, the General Assembly passed a resolution approving the draft Agreement. This Agreement,
which came into force on 19 September, not only brought IOM into the United Nations system, it also
resulted in IOM becoming the “UN Migration Agency”.

9.       Once the Agreement came into force, various institutional mechanisms were activated to
integrate IOM into the United Nations system. IOM was invited to become a full member of the United
Nations Development Group. The Organization’s status in the Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC)
was also upgraded to full membership. IOM participated in the United Nations High-level Committee on
Programmes and the Chief Executives Board for Coordination, and continued its engagement in these
bodies.

10.      IOM’s new status in the United Nations system was also a central discussion point in the
negotiations on the modalities for the development of a global compact for safe, orderly and regular
migration to be adopted at an intergovernmental conference to be held in 2018 and the related
preparatory process. Member States called for IOM to play a leading role in jointly servicing, together with
the Secretariat of the United Nations, the preparatory process and negotiations for the development and
adoption of the global compact, with IOM providing the technical and policy expertise required. IOM
immediately began to operationalize this mandate, making preparations for a range of activities to
support the process.

11.      The Organization’s newly acquired right to participate in various inter-agency mechanisms
increased demands on IOM for information and strategic thinking. Further work and engagement are
required to more closely integrate IOM into the United Nations system. This work will be supported by the
development of an integration plan to guide the IOM Administration on the various United Nations bodies

                                                                                                  Page 5


and processes in place at the global, regional and national levels, and to help inform decision-making on
the mechanisms of most relevance to IOM and to the issue of migration. IOM’s engagement with
individual United Nations entities has expanded, and will continue to expand in various areas.

Sustainable Development Goals

12.       The adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its framework of
17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and related targets in September 2015 gave impetus to
addressing migration across different line ministries directly engaged in pursuing sustainable
development. In March 2016, the United Nations Statistical Commission endorsed a global SDG indicator
developed by IOM and the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA) on the
number of countries that have implemented well-managed migration policies (indicator 10.7.2). This
indicator uses the three principles and three objectives of the Migration Governance Framework. IOM and
UNDESA continue to develop the methodology for the implementation of this indicator and expect to start
collecting data by the end of 2017.

13.       IOM has a long history of assisting its Member States, which – even before the adoption of the
SDGs – recognized the importance of, among others: reducing remittance transfer costs (target 10.c);
mobilizing diaspora investments (target 10.b); making sure that the recruitment of migrants is fair and
ethical (target 8.8); ensuring that migrants have access to basic health services (target 3.8); and
eradicating all forms of modern-day slavery and protecting vulnerable migrants (targets 5.2, 8.7 and
16.2).

                    Sustainable Development Goal targets linked to migration

14.       In 2016, 70 IOM offices around the world provided technical assistance to their host
governments on the SDGs. In 47 countries, IOM assisted the host government to prioritize migration-
related SDG targets relevant to the national context or to draft a national strategy for the implementation
of the migration-related SDGs. In 32 countries, IOM’s expertise helped to translate global SDG indicators
into national ones or build statistical capacity to report on the SDGs. Lastly, 30 IOM offices were requested
to implement projects geared towards achieving a particular SDG target. As a result, IOM provided training
and guidance to government counterparts on the Migration Governance Framework, the Migration
Governance Index (MGI) and the SDGs relevant to migration.

15.       In 2016, IOM dedicated both workshops of its principal forum for migration policy dialogue, the
International Dialogue on Migration (IDM), to the follow-up and review of migration in the SDGs. The main
focus of discussions was how to produce new tools to support Member States to achieve the SDGs.

Migration Governance Index

16.        As part of the Organization’s contribution to supporting follow-up and review of the SDGs, IOM
and the Economist Intelligence Unit produced the MGI, which provides a framework for countries to
measure their progress towards better migration governance. Governments can use the results to identify
gaps and priorities when building institutional capacity and devising new migration policies and
programmes. The MGI considers countries’ institutional frameworks in several key policy areas, including:
(a) institutional capacity; (b) migrant rights; (c) safe and orderly migration; (d) labour migration
management; and (e) partnerships. These five policy domains were inspired by the Migration Governance
Framework.

17.       IOM and the Economist Intelligence Unit applied the MGI to 15 pilot countries. This exercise
determined that it was possible to synthesize and compare such complex policy areas in countries with
very diverse migratory contexts. The main findings of the first MGI report, Measuring well-governed
migration: The 2016 Migration Governance Index, were presented in Bangkok, Berlin, Geneva and
Pretoria.


PRINCIPLE 1: ADHERENCE TO INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS AND FULFILMENT OF
MIGRANTS’ RIGHTS

Supporting States’ adherence to international standards

18.        IOM advocates for the respect, protection and fulfilment of the rights of individuals, regardless
of nationality or migration status and without discrimination, to preserve their safety, physical integrity,
well-being and dignity. The Organization supports States in their efforts to ensure adherence to migration-
related international standards. In 2016, 103 IOM offices supported their host governments in such
efforts across a wide range of sectors, compared with 91 offices the year before. Most offices support
the ministries responsible for immigration/migration and migrants, border management, public works,
justice, internal or public security, home affairs and health, among others.

19.       IOM promotes States’ adherence to international standards by organizing consultations and
information sessions with selected ministries, training officials on international standards (as reported by
101 offices), promoting public policy on protection issues and carrying out assessments on the country’s
level of adherence (upon request by the host government in 41 countries).

20.      As a result of IOM’s support, several migration laws around the world have been revised to align
them with international standards. For instance, new and revised policies and national standard
operating procedures against human trafficking and smuggling benefited from IOM’s expertise in
27 countries. IOM also organized a conference that supported the Republic of Korea in seeking more
collaboration with the Philippines and Viet Nam to address labour exploitation in the fishing industry. In
Indonesia, a new government decree – based in part on IOM’s research into human trafficking in

                                                                                                    Page 7


Indonesian fisheries – will address chronic human rights abuses in the industry through the creation of a
certification mechanism to rid the national fishing industry of human rights violations.

21.       In 2016, IOM contributed to the drafting of employment policies for nationals abroad or foreign
workers in 11 countries, and to the national development plans of another 14 countries in the area of
migration. In addition, as a result of IOM’s substantive technical contribution, the 11 member countries
of the Regional Conference on Migration approved three major policy documents aimed at supporting
States’ adherence to international standards relating to migrant children. Egypt also established a task
force on the protection of unaccompanied migrant children after a study visit and further training provided
by IOM. In the European Union (EU), IOM assists Member States to align and harmonize their legislation
with the EU acquis and best practices on asylum and migration management (e.g. in relation to the
detention, return and reintegration of migrants).

22.      As regards migration and health, IOM participated in the global review process of the
implementation of the International Health Regulations (2005) in response to the Ebola outbreak. The
Report of the Review Committee recommended that migrants and mobile populations be included in
epidemic and pandemic preparedness and response plans; it also highlighted the need for a better
understanding of population mobility patterns to identify potentially vulnerable zones.

23.       Furthermore, IOM is actively engaged in supporting private companies in 37 countries to comply
with international standards, in particular those on ethical recruitment in supply chains (see the “Private
sector” section under Principle 3). IOM also helped civil society organizations (CSOs) by optimizing their
support and monitoring role vis-à-vis the government in 37 countries.

     Themes discussed at IOM workshops to support adherence to international standards

24.      In 2016, IOM launched its manual entitled Rights-based approach to programming. Sixty-six
IOM offices worldwide are already using the manual to strengthen the fulfilment of rights through their
programmes as well as to incorporate the rights principles, such as non-discrimination, participation,
accountability and transparency, within all programmes.

Promoting gender equality

25.      IOM is also committed to adhering to international standards in its own work. In 2016, the IOM
Gender Equality Policy was rolled out, and 102 offices confirmed that gender was mainstreamed
throughout their programmes. Thirty-nine of them reported including specific components to address
gender inequalities in one or more of their projects.

26.       Half of the offices reported working specifically towards decreasing gender-based violence
among displaced and vulnerable persons. As part of its engagements in multilateral processes, and
capitalizing on its previous experience in various locations, IOM co-hosted, with the United Nations Entity
for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN-Women) and the Office of the High
Commissioner for Human Rights, a conference in Sarajevo to discuss reparations for survivors of conflict-
related sexual violence in the Western Balkans.

27.        IOM supports the promotion of gender equality in the area of border management, such as
through working to operationalize gender concepts in daily border management processes. For instance,
in Tajikistan, IOM is helping to increase border guards’ understanding of gender issues at the operational
level. IOM also supports professional and career development of female law enforcement officers in
20 countries across Europe and Asia through the annual Women in Policing Conference; the fifth
Conference was held in Tbilisi in March 2016.

Principled humanitarian response

28.         The Organization’s institutional humanitarian policy, the Principles for Humanitarian Action, was
officially launched in 2016. IOM’s humanitarian policy framework enhances the Organization’s capacity
to provide principled and effective responses in volatile and complex operational environments, and
ensures that the Organization’s performance in humanitarian emergencies is steered by humanitarian
standards and principles.

29.       In 2016, 88 IOM offices promoted principled humanitarian action through building the capacity
of partners, coordination efforts and planning processes. Sixty-seven offices indicated that humanitarian
principles or related standards featured in their strategic plan or project documents. Throughout 2016,
IOM continued to be an active member of the IASC Reference Group on Principled Humanitarian Action,
with the overall objective to promote adherence to, and the effective operationalization of, humanitarian
principles in operations and policies.

30.       In line with the Global Protection Cluster approach to mainstreaming protection, IOM issued an
internal guidance note on how to mainstream protection across IOM crisis response. This guidance note
helps IOM offices to mainstream protection across all sectors of assistance in IOM’s crisis response. So
far, more than 100 IOM staff and partners have been trained on protection mainstreaming, and a session
on this is routinely included in major institutional training programmes.

Protection from sexual exploitation and abuse

31.       With regard to protection from sexual exploitation and abuse (PSEA), IOM continued its efforts
to prevent and respond to sexual exploitation and abuse by aid workers in humanitarian response
operations. The Director General continued to provide leadership as the IASC Champion on PSEA. In this
capacity, he convened the biannual meetings where the Senior Focal Points on PSEA provide institutional
updates on their implementation of the Minimum Operating Standards on PSEA. Alongside the Special
Coordinator on Improving the United Nations Response to Sexual Exploitation and Abuse, he also
addressed the Humanitarian Coordinators at their annual retreat to discuss their leadership

                                                                                                    C/108/4
                                                                                                      Page 9


responsibilities under commitments contained in the 2015 Statement by the Inter-Agency Standing
Committee on Protection from Sexual Exploitation and Abuse. IOM further coordinated with governments
and partner organizations to promote inter-agency collaboration on PSEA through side events at the World
Humanitarian Summit and at the Economic and Social Council humanitarian affairs segment.

32.      IOM is an active member of the IASC Task Team on Accountability to Affected Populations and
Protection from Sexual Exploitation and Abuse, which promotes global-level coordination and supports
the technical capacity of in-country PSEA networks, including the helpdesk that responds to humanitarian
country team requests for support on prevention and response measures.

33.       In cooperation with other agencies, IOM produced an operational toolkit endorsed by the
IASC Principals in 2016 and designed to provide concrete guidance on field-level implementation of
collective PSEA activities. These tools included the Best Practice Guide: Inter-agency Community-based
Complaint Mechanisms and the accompanying global standard operating procedures.

Accountability to affected populations

34.       Accountability to affected populations is intrinsic to the rights-based approach adopted by IOM.
In 2016, IOM increased its global efforts on accountability to affected populations beyond its
humanitarian programmes. An interdepartmental working group was established and launched a cross-
sectoral review of IOM’s policies and activities on accountability to affected populations in relation to the
IASC commitments. The review will form the basis of an institutional framework on accountability to
affected populations to be developed in 2017. The framework is intended to enhance IOM’s
accountability to beneficiaries by improving the quality and use of feedback mechanisms across IOM
throughout the project cycle, from the design stage through to project evaluation.

35.       An initial mapping of feedback mechanisms enabled IOM to identify where and how feedback is
currently collected by offices. Survey results indicated that approximately 5.7 million beneficiaries had
access to an IOM feedback mechanism in 2016, with over 2 million people using one of the various
channels available to provide feedback to the Organization.




                 Communication channels used by IOM offices to gather feedback
-----------------------Page 13 End-----------------------

C/108/4
Page 10




                        How the selected communication channels are used




36.       The most common communication channels were face-to-face interviews and paper-based
surveys, followed by focus group discussions and call centres or hotlines. One common tool used to
capture feedback for analysis is the Community Response Map, an online feedback platform. These
mechanisms were employed most often to provide information about IOM services and assess the
satisfaction of beneficiaries. Most offices (72%) operated feedback mechanisms independently;
28 per cent collected feedback jointly with government or other agencies. IOM offices that respond to
feedback (81%) did so in a variety of ways, for instance to provide referrals or to guide new initiatives to
reallocate resources.


PRINCIPLE 2: EVIDENCE AND WHOLE-OF-GOVERNMENT APPROACHES

Strengthening production and analysis of migration data and evidence

37.      IOM aims to serve Member States and the international community as the lead reference for
data and evidence related to migration. To this effect, IOM endeavours to strengthen the production and
analysis of national, regional and global migration data, for both external and internal use.

38.      In 2016, 104 offices completed studies, research papers or assessments, some of which were
published. Most IOM research focuses on the integration of migrants in host countries, irregular
migration, regional migration trends, mobility linked to climate change and return migration. IOM also
contributes to the European Migration Network with studies on various topics. Under the
ACP–EU Migration Action, 18 baseline assessments were also completed on 28 African, Caribbean and
Pacific States on subjects linked to the recommendations of the ACP–EU Dialogue on Migration and
Development, namely on visas, remittances, readmission, trafficking in human beings and smuggling of
migrants.

39.       Eighty-six offices worked to improve the capacity of academics, practitioners, governments and
civil society to collect, analyse and use data and statistics relating to migration. In 48 countries,
-----------------------Page 14 End-----------------------

                                                                                                    C/108/4
                                                                                                     Page 11


IOM helped to improve existing data sources and related infrastructure where needed. The Organization
also produced a training guide on migration data.

40.      IOM provided governments with support for research and statistics reviews to increase
understanding of country-specific challenges relating to migration and to inform new policies. This was
the case in Colombia, in preparation for the 2017 census, and in Ethiopia, where IOM is currently
developing the country’s first Migration Profile, which will lay the foundation for a migration policy. In
Albania, IOM supported the development of the National Strategy on Development and Integration
2015–2020, which was approved in 2016 and foresees the development of a new migration policy.

41.      In addition to sharing migration-related information with national government counterparts or
through inter-agency mechanisms, the Organization has been partnering with other leaders in this field
to combat modern-day slavery. The Counter-trafficking Data Collaborative platform– the first of its kind –
makes IOM and its partners’ data available to researchers, academics, policymakers and practitioners,
while ensuring the anonymity of victims.

42.       The first phase of the Mixed Migration Flows in the Mediterranean and Beyond initiative ended
with activities spanning over 15 countries of the central and eastern Mediterranean migration routes,
including countries of origin and final destination. Thirty-two rounds of information products were
published via the Migration Flows Portal, which was visited by over 165,000 users during the year. The
IOM Displacement Tracking Matrix (DTM) 1 extended beyond emergency response, increasing
understanding of mobility and providing analysis of ongoing mobility cycles.

43.       The IOM Global Migration Data Analysis Centre organized several international meetings,
including the Understanding and Measuring “Safe” Migration workshop and an international conference
entitled Improving Data on International Migration. Both events explored how to improve the evidence-
base for monitoring progress towards the migration-related SDGs. In 2016, the Centre also initiated work
on the Global Migration Data Portal, which will facilitate the sharing and understanding of international
data on migration.

44.       IOM publications are a rich source of data and evidence relating to migration issues. In 2016,
IOM publications were downloaded over 2 million times from the IOM bookstore. The most downloaded
publications were the World Migration Reports, Ulyana’s Grote Avontuur (a comic to educate
10–17 year-olds on integration and voluntary return), the Fatal Journeys reports (Volumes 1 and 2),
Migration, Environment and Climate Change: Assessing the Evidence and the Global Migration Trends
Factsheet.

Whole-of-government approach to migration

45.      Given that migration is a cross-cutting issue, IOM supported Member States with technical
assistance to foster a whole-of-government approach to migration management, thereby reinforcing
mutual linkages between migration and other relevant policy areas. This approach integrates the
collaborative efforts of all government ministries to optimize the impact of their policies.

46.        In 2016, 90 IOM offices contributed to efforts to mainstream migration and include migrants’
rights in policies produced by different ministries, by providing training and technical assistance, but also
through expert secondments and participation in relevant task forces.

47.       IOM supported interministerial coordination in 74 per cent of the countries that have established
one or more coordination mechanisms between ministries. During the year, IOM’s expertise served to
establish or contributed to the development and implementation of migration policies among government
institutions, CSOs and academia. IOM experts also participated in task forces on migration alongside
experts from various ministries (e.g. in Afghanistan, Argentina, Austria, Bangladesh, Belarus, Kazakhstan,
Mauritius, the Philippines and Yemen). IOM was furthermore requested to bring its technical expertise to

1   For more details on the DTM, see the “Emergency response” section under Objective 2.
-----------------------Page 15 End-----------------------

C/108/4
Page 12


interministerial committees on specific themes, such as human trafficking (e.g. in Armenia, Ethiopia,
Montenegro, Mozambique and Timor-Leste) and integrated crisis response (e.g. in Croatia, the Federated
States of Micronesia, Greece and the United States of America).

Migration and development

48.      IOM continuously seeks to optimize the relationship between migration and development, by
contributing to new national policies on international migration and development (e.g. in Ghana, Jamaica,
Mauritius, Somalia and Turkey) or integrating migration into existing policies (e.g. in Armenia, Georgia and
Vanuatu). In 2016, IOM strengthened the evidence base on migration and development for planning and
policy development at the national level in Bangladesh, Kyrgyzstan, the Republic of Moldova and Serbia.
The Organization also supported the drafting of the national migration and development strategies and
plans of action in Jamaica, Kyrgyzstan, Morocco, the Republic of Moldova and Serbia. As a capacity-
building measure, IOM facilitated the development of migration and development curricula in higher
education and advanced training institutions for State officials in Kyrgyzstan and Serbia. In addition to
providing technical assistance, IOM has improved the skills of over 3,300 government officials to
mainstream migration into development-related sectoral policies or strategies.

49.      The contributions made by diasporas to their home or host country also play a significant role in
development. In this respect, IOM has been supporting the governments of several countries (e.g. Egypt,
Lithuania, the Republic of Moldova and Zambia) to develop a strategy to engage their diasporas in various
development initiatives.

Migration and health

50.      IOM’s role in advancing national capacities in migrant health management has contributed to
the development of national migrant health policies and action plans. The Organization’s approach to
developing such policies is guided by the following principles: taking a participatory, multidisciplinary and
intersectoral whole-of-government approach to addressing health issues of migrants; adopting an
evidence-based approach to policy formulation and practice; and ensuring policies cover all types of
migrants. IOM’s technical cooperation with the Government of Sri Lanka, for instance, advanced migrant
health issues in regional governance mechanisms influencing labour issues, such as the Colombo
Process.

51.      The Organization strives to bridge migration and health issues in order to promote coherence
among policies from various sectors which affect migrants’ well-being. For instance, in Azerbaijan and
Slovenia, IOM is promoting cultural orientation in health-care systems; in Costa Rica, it is participating in
a Central American joint initiative on the health of migrants; in Kazakhstan, Morocco, Myanmar and
Sri Lanka, it is supporting a migration health unit in the Ministry of Health; and in Indonesia and Kenya,
it supports medical care tailored to the needs of migrants.

Migration, the environment and climate change

52.      IOM seeks to promote stronger coherence between policies and practices related to migration,
the environment and climate change through: (a) the integration of human mobility considerations in
climate change, sustainable development and disaster risk reduction policies and strategies; and (b) the
inclusion of environmental and climate change concerns in migration policies.

53.        As part of this work, IOM – in collaboration with Sciences Po University in Paris – produced the
first illustrated publication bringing together existing global data and knowledge on migration, the
environment and climate change, namely the Atlas of Environmental Migration.

54.      The Organization published new country assessments and research on the links between
migration, the environment and climate change for a number of countries (i.e. Azerbaijan, Bangladesh,
Cambodia, the Dominican Republic, Haiti, Kenya, Kyrgyzstan, Maldives, Morocco, Nepal, Papua New
Guinea and Viet Nam). Several of these will serve as a basis for the development of national action plans
-----------------------Page 16 End-----------------------

                                                                                                C/108/4
                                                                                                 Page 13


and regional strategy frameworks. A study focusing on the links between environmental change, water
management and migration was conducted in Kazakhstan. Another study assessed the role of
environmental factors in shaping migration to Canada. In Azerbaijan, Cambodia, Mauritius and Morocco,
IOM trained policymakers and practitioners involved in areas of strategic relevance to the management
of environmental migration. In the Plurinational State of Bolivia, the Organization enhanced coordination
on this topic between the relevant ministries.

55.        At the global policy level, IOM has been actively promoting the inclusion of human mobility
concerns in key policy agendas. IOM took a leading role on migration issues in the follow-up to the Paris
Agreement under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), and organized
the first technical meeting on migration, displacement and human mobility. IOM also played a key role in
promoting the recognition of the importance of human mobility concerns at the United Nations
Environment Assembly, the World Humanitarian Summit and other global summits. In December, IOM
was invited to be part of the UNFCCC Task Force on Climate and Displacement.


PRINCIPLE 3: PARTNERSHIPS

56.      IOM believes that, to achieve effective and beneficial migration, partnerships are required to
broaden the understanding of migration and to develop comprehensive and efficient approaches. IOM’s
expertise and vast network of offices ideally position the Organization to support Member States and to
advance good migration governance.

Global partnerships

57.      IOM contributed to many international conferences and processes in 2016 to ensure that
migrants and migration issues were given due attention. Fifty-two offices were engaged in such global
processes and provided technical advice, facilitated meetings and raised public awareness on migration-
related matters.

Summit for Refugees and Migrants

58.      On 19 September 2016, the United Nations held the Summit for Refugees and Migrants, which
was its first high-level meeting to address refugee and migration issues. IOM’s technical and policy
expertise was essential to ensuring balance between the refugee and migration-related elements and
aspirations of the Summit. IOM contributed to the Report of the Secretary-General, In safety and dignity:
addressing large movements of refugees and migrants, and the New York Declaration for Refugees and
Migrants, which was adopted by the General Assembly at the Summit. The Declaration focused on the
common needs and rights of migrants and refugees in large movements, addressing issues such as
immediate reception needs, trafficking in persons and smuggling of migrants, and xenophobia and
discrimination towards migrants and refugees.

59.       The New York Declaration also recognized the positive contribution made by migrants to
inclusive growth and sustainable development, and framed migration not as a problem to be solved but
as a phenomenon to be managed through planned and well-managed policies, consistent with the
2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.

60.        The contribution made by IOM to the Summit also ensured that its outcomes focused on
addressing international migration in all its dimensions, and on fostering international cooperation to
facilitate safe, regular and orderly migration and human mobility, ensuring the humane treatment and
human rights of all migrants.

61.       In addition to its work as part of the team of the Secretary-General’s Special Adviser on the
Summit, IOM worked throughout the Organization to raise awareness about the Summit and foster
national, regional and thematic dialogues to support the preparatory process, including through many of
the Regional Consultative Processes on Migration (RCPs). IOM helped to lead and contributed to the
-----------------------Page 17 End-----------------------

C/108/4
Page 14


preparatory meetings organized by the Global Migration Group in New York, and worked closely with
multiple civil society actors to ensure that their voices were heard. IOM’s entry into the United Nations
system, which came into effect with the signing ceremony at the Summit, was considered to be a key
deliverable of the Summit and a critical contribution to global governance of migration.

World Humanitarian Summit

62.      The first World Humanitarian Summit was held in Turkey in May 2016. During this event,
IOM organized the Special Session on Migrants and Humanitarian Action, and, jointly with the World Food
Programme, represented United Nations agencies on behalf of the IASC on the High-level Leaders’
Roundtable on Financing: Investing in Humanity. The Summit brought together some 9,000 participants
representing 173 Member States of the United Nations, the private sector, civil society and non-
governmental organizations (NGOs). IOM sought to contribute to constructive and collaborative
discussions on improving the humanitarian system, while at the same time advocating for an increased
recognition of the needs and vulnerabilities of migrants and other mobile populations in humanitarian
responses. One of the concrete outcomes of the Summit was the Grand Bargain, of which IOM is a
signatory and founding organization.

International Dialogue on Migration

63.      One of the main roles of the IDM is to promote partnerships and strengthen global collaboration
on key migration issues. For instance, the outcomes of the 2015 Conference on Migrants and Cities were
shared with over 9,000 counterparts, including IOM Member States, in the resulting report, which
contains best practices and policy recommendations to enhance migration management and strengthen
collaboration between relevant actors at city level. All respondents to a follow-up survey of participants
indicated that they shared the information learned at the Conference with colleagues in their institutions
and other counterparts. Ninety-seven per cent used the information and Conference outcomes in their
work in a wide range of activities (e.g. formulation of national migration policies and strategies, creation
of dedicated departments for migrant integration). The Conference also positioned IOM as a key partner
in preparations leading up to global processes on migration and city issues, such as the United Nations
Conference on Housing and Sustainable Development (Habitat III).

64.       In February/March, IOM engaged over 300 representatives of States, organizations, global
processes, CSOs and the private sector in the two-day IDM workshop entitled Follow-up and Review of
Migration in the SDGs. The meeting presented results from IOM’s partnerships with the Economist
Intelligence Unit on measuring migration policy and Gallup World Polls on gauging the well-being of
migrants. It also presented collaboration with UNDESA on methods to survey migration policy with support
from governments. The second IDM workshop of the year, held in October, also discussed the
implementation of the migration-related SDGs and enabled exchanges, the creation of links and
consolidation of partnerships between relevant migration actors.

Migrants in Countries in Crisis Initiative

65.      At the request of and with the support of the co-chairs, namely the Governments of the
United States and the Philippines, IOM served as the Secretariat of the State-led Migrants in Countries in
Crisis (MICIC) Initiative, designed to enhance protection and assistance for migrants in countries
experiencing conflicts or natural disasters.

66.      Six regional and four stakeholder consultations were organized to gather the input, views and
effective practices of participants, which included the private sector, civil society and partner
intergovernmental organizations. The Secretariat also convened a series of webinars. Policy briefs, a
repository of more than 250 practices garnered from governments, partner intergovernmental
organizations, NGOs and academics and other tools are available on the MICIC website. The Secretariat
also organized side events on MICIC at other major events, including the World Humanitarian Summit.
The MICIC Guidelines to Protect Migrants in Countries Experiencing Conflict or Natural Disasters were
launched in New York and Geneva.
-----------------------Page 18 End-----------------------

                                                                                                    C/108/4
                                                                                                     Page 15


67.       IOM also developed tools for consular officials to help them reach and protect their nationals in
crisis contexts and for civil protection and disaster responders to ensure the inclusion of migrants in their
national disaster response and management systems.

Global Forum on Migration and Development

68.      IOM has been involved in the Global Forum on Migration and Development since its inception in
2007 and regularly supports the Chairperson and the Roundtable Co-Chairs, for instance by producing
thematic background papers, offering expert advice and providing logistical support.

69.      In 2016, under the guidance of the Chairperson and Roundtable Co-Chairs, IOM contributed to
the development of several background papers, including Migrants in situations of crises: Conflict, climate
change and natural disasters; and Principles, institutions and processes for safe, orderly and regular
migration. The Organization also conducted several research projects as input to the consultations; for
instance, by preparing a study on the recruitment industry between the United Arab Emirates and Nepal,
and by leading a collaborative effort between the International Labour Organization (ILO), IOM and the
United Nations Development Programme to identify good practices, promising policy initiatives and case
studies on the themes of the Global Forum on Migration and Development in 2016.

70.      The Organization will continue to support the Global Forum as a platform for consultation and
information exchange among Member States, to advance understanding and cooperation on migration
and development and to encourage the dissemination of best practices.

Partnerships with other agencies

71.       IOM continued to strengthen its partnerships with individual agencies at the global level. For
instance, IOM and the ILO further developed their training partnership for the International Training
Centre of the ILO in Turin and IOM’s participation at the Labour Migration Academy. IOM continued its
close cooperation with the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) to address migration-
related organized crime, most notably under the Global Action to Prevent and Address Trafficking in
Persons and the Smuggling of Migrants project and the Inter-Agency Coordination Group against
Trafficking in Persons. Moreover, the Organization continued to support the Global Protection Cluster
training for Global Protection Cluster Coordinators. As part of its cooperation with the World Health
Organization (WHO), IOM contributed to the development of the Strategy and action plan for refugee and
migrant health in the WHO European Region.

Regional and interregional partnerships

72.       Regional and interregional bodies and forums are critical actors in improving international
migration governance. These can be regional agencies or State-led migration policy dialogues, referred
to collectively as Inter-State Consultation Mechanisms on Migration (ISCMs), which at the regional level
(RCPs) and interregional level (interregional forums on migration) contribute to policy approaches on
migration among participating States.

73.     In 2016, 71 IOM offices supported RCPs, providing secretariat or technical support on policy
and research at the request of participating States. In parallel, 35 offices supported interregional forums
on migration.

74.      IOM organized the Sixth Global RCP Meeting, which brought together all ISCMs under the theme
“Migration and the Sustainable Development Goals: the Role of Inter-State Consultation Mechanisms on
Migration and of Regional Economic Organizations” in Geneva, bringing together 21 ISCMs, the
United Nations Regional Commissions and regional economic organizations to explore areas for
cooperation and partnerships to achieve the SDGs.

75.      Regional partnerships greatly contributed to IOM’s work in different areas of migration in 2016.
For instance, the Transnational Action project, implemented under the EU Strategy towards the
-----------------------Page 19 End-----------------------

Page 16


Eradication of Trafficking in Human Beings, contributed to tackling human trafficking in the countries it
covered. IOM’s partnership with the Central American Regional Coalition to Counter Trafficking resulted
in a pioneering regional victim assistance protocol. Partnerships with the Southern Common Market
(MERCOSUR) and the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) led to increased capacity to address
counter-trafficking from a gender perspective and the human rights of migrants in the respective regions.
The tripartite partnership between IOM, UNODC and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in
Europe (OSCE) is instrumental to counter transnational organized crime in the Western Balkans. Regional
partnerships with MERCOSUR and OSCE enhanced border management through improved regional
dialogue. IOM’s engagement with regional and interregional public health networks helped to mainstream
migration health in national public health approaches. For instance, IOM and the Public Health Network
of the Asia–Europe Foundation conducted the first interregional dialogue on addressing the health
vulnerabilities of migrants in large migration flows, which brought together governments and other
development partners to share best practices.

76.       Regional partnerships, for instance with the League of Arab States, the Intergovernmental
Authority on Development, the European Migration Network, the Latin American Parliament and the
Pacific Immigration Directors’ Conference, proved crucial to optimize cooperation and the sharing of
migration data and trends and to assess, design and implement relevant policies. Other equally important
regional initiatives received IOM’s support during the reporting period, such as the Panel on Asylum and
Migration within the Eastern Partnership and the Migration, Asylum, Refugees Regional Initiative.

Humanitarian and development partnerships with international organizations

77.       IOM is an engaged member at all levels of the IASC, including in the IASC Principals meetings,
the Emergency Directors Group, the Working Group and most IASC task teams and reference groups. The
Organization was engaged in 52 formally activated clusters and sectoral coordination or working groups
in 34 countries, including serving as the lead for the Global Camp Coordination and Camp Management
Cluster for displacement induced by natural disasters.

78.      IOM also partners with clusters and agencies, including the Gender-based Violence Area of
Responsibility, the Women’s Refugee Commission and the Cooperative for Assistance and Relief
Everywhere to reduce the risks of gender-based violence in emergency settings, and with WHO to ensure
that due attention be given to health in the context of migration and forced displacement.

79.        As part of its focus on transition and recovery work in crisis contexts, IOM participates in the
United Nations Working Group on Transitions, the United Nations Senior Leadership Group on Disaster
Risk Reduction and Resilience and the Inter-Agency Working Group on Disarmament, Demobilization and
Reintegration. The Organization also worked with the Capacity for Disaster Reduction Initiative and the
Platform on Disaster Displacement to support disaster prevention, preparedness, response and recovery,
and with the Solutions Alliance on addressing protracted displacement situations. IOM joined the Steering
Committee of the SAFE Humanitarian Working Group, which seeks to meet the fuel and energy needs of
crisis-affected populations.

80.       The Organization’s standby partners provided emergency personnel and service packages to fill
specific staffing gaps and augment IOM emergency response teams. IOM continued its collaboration with
the International Humanitarian Partnership to provide short-term accommodation to humanitarian
responders. IOM also partners with the White Helmets to enable the provision of humanitarian assistance
to migrants and to foster cooperation and research.

81.       IOM continued to support the work of the Inter-Agency Coordination Group against Trafficking in
Persons, a policy forum aimed at improving coordination and cooperation among United Nations agencies
and other international organizations to assist States in preventing and combating human trafficking. For
instance, IOM contributed to two issue papers, Pivoting toward the Evidence: Building effective counter-
trafficking responses using accumulated knowledge and a shared approach to monitoring, evaluation
and learning and Providing Effective Remedies for Victims of Trafficking in Persons, and to the Toolkit for
Guidance in Designing and Evaluating Counter-Trafficking Programmes.

                                                                                                   Page 17


National and local government

82.       Migration presents opportunities and challenges that are addressed by a wide range of
ministries. IOM therefore supports the ministries responsible for border management and
immigration/migration and more broadly the ministries of foreign affairs, interior, labour and justice (see
the “Whole-of-government approach to migration” section under Principle 2). Depending on the domestic
context, IOM’s expertise is also requested by ministries of education, health, diaspora, social affairs or
the environment. Many IOM offices (68%) also reported working with local authorities at provincial or
community level, thereby increasing the impact of joint programmes.

83.       Increased awareness about migration issues led to intensive legislative and policymaking
activities in 2016; IOM was called upon to support governments in assessing, reviewing, drafting and
implementing existing or new policies and laws. The Organization also trained officials and practitioners,
building institutional capacities and developing a common understanding of migration. Joint actions and
coordination among ministries have improved via platforms supported by IOM; campaigns targeting both
migrants and communities have been designed; and sustainable migrant integration practices have
improved the access of migrants to health-care services and their awareness about their rights.

Civil society

84.       IOM and CSOs cooperate on a broad range of migration issues at global, regional, national and
local level. IOM’s CSO partners include NGOs, NGO networks, advocacy groups, migrant organizations,
professional associations, media organizations, academic and research institutes and universities, and
philanthropic foundations. IOM involves and relies on civil society, including local community-based
organizations, in its programmatic work.

85.       In 2016, such cooperation focused on counter-trafficking and direct assistance to migrants
(in 76 countries), capacity-building (67 countries), awareness-raising among CSOs (55 countries) and
referrals (53 countries), but also covered areas such as vocational training, information campaigns,
research and crisis response. During the year, 72 per cent of IOM offices partnered with national and
international CSOs, increasing outreach to migrants and complementing IOM programmes to deliver
better assistance to migrants.

86.      Sixty-seven offices increased their CSO partners’ capacity to uphold international standards. For
instance, in Indonesia, IOM cooperates with the Centre for the Trust, Peace and Social Relations of
Coventry University on workshops on maritime security and the protection of migrants at sea.

87.      Partnering with CSOs has also enabled IOM to exchange information and best practices through
platforms such as the National Platform of Cooperation for Integration in Poland, whose 120 members
share knowledge and experience between migrant communities, public institutions, NGOs and other
relevant stakeholders. Migrant NGOs are very active members of the Platform.

88.       In January, IOM convened the MICIC Civil Society Consultation, with over 80 participants from
international and national NGOs, migrant associations, diaspora communities and academia and MICIC
Working Group members. These discussions contributed to the MICIC Guidelines to Protect Migrants in
Countries Experiencing Conflict or Natural Disaster, mentioned above.

89.       In June, the annual IOM–NGO humanitarian consultations, co-organized by IOM and the
International Council of Voluntary Agencies, brought together representatives of 46 NGOs from
18 countries and had the overarching theme of partnerships. The event highlighted examples of good
partnership practices between NGOs and IOM in the field, emphasizing the value added for the partners.
During breakout sessions, participants took stock of best practices on current topics: changing the
negative narrative on migration; the humanitarian–development nexus; and accountability to affected
populations. Participants also identified ways of expanding IOM–NGO complementarity across these key
areas in the future.

Private sector

90.     The IOM Private Sector Partnership Strategy 2016–2020 outlines the Organization’s
commitment to develop strategic partnerships with private sector actors in order to harness their
knowledge, expertise, skills and resources for the benefit of migrants and society.

91.       Fifty-three IOM offices reported that their work had included engagement with over 150 private
sector partners and donors in 2016. In many instances, partnerships with the private sector enhanced
existing IOM projects funded by traditional donors.

92.       As part of the Organization’s efforts to drive innovation, IOM collaborated with a multinational
telecommunications company deploying state-of-the-art technology solutions to improve health-care
services, advance education and reduce climate vulnerability for remote communities in Bangladesh. IOM
also engaged with an Irish design company, which helped devise a new concept for labelling medicine
given to migrants, including refugees.

93.       Partnering with the private sector can dramatically expand IOM’s reach on key migration-related
issues. For instance, in Finland, a marketing agency worked free of charge with high school students to
produce a short film and designed a plan for the IOM campaign against human trafficking, What is the
price of a human being? In promoting diversity, two social media companies gave free support to IOM’s
i am a migrant campaign. In Thailand, IOM partnered with two technology companies to launch a
crowdfunding platform that connects donors with trafficking survivors and to develop a prototype for a
mobile application to prevent exploitation of domestic workers. The Organization also offered training to
ferry companies, which increased the awareness of staff about trafficking and how to identify victims.

94.       The private sector is a key stakeholder in IRIS (International Recruitment Integrity System), which
was developed by IOM to promote fair recruitment. In 2016, the Organization led ethical recruitment
information sessions in 25 countries, including Cambodia, Czechia, Nicaragua, Poland, Thailand, Turkey
and Viet Nam. The sessions engaged the agricultural, construction, consumer goods and garment sectors
and a number of recruitment agencies. IOM assisted a global consumer goods company in implementing
ethical recruitment practices for migrant workers in its supply chain. Working with a multinational
technology company, IOM assisted migrant workers with pre-departure orientation workshops designed
to help labour migrants understand their rights.

95.      Migrant participation in the labour market is a key way to ensure sustainable integration. IOM
partnered with businesses in Belgium, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain,
and the United Kingdom to increase labour market access for migrants. The IOM job placement
programme in Kazakhstan put returnees seeking work in contact with a number of local and multinational
businesses to facilitate their long-term reintegration. In Colombia, a partnership with a global bank
provided young victims of armed conflict with guidance on financial services; and IOM, together with a
multinational technology company, trained ex-combatants in IT skills in order to improve their livelihood
opportunities.

Diaspora engagement

96.      IOM aims to engage, enable and empower diaspora members as agents for development. In
2016, 58 IOM offices promoted the development role of diasporas by engaging with migrant groups and
governments in home and host countries, and enhancing dialogue. Thirty-five offices had directly
partnered with the diaspora, mostly through networks of professionals or issue-based organizations. IOM
builds and facilitates platforms for the exchange of practices and networking, bringing together qualified
members of the diaspora, academia, civil society and the private sector. A successful example of such a
platform is the Diaspora Engagement Hub in the Republic of Moldova. Using the Hub, diaspora members
could submit grant requests for projects on professional return, diaspora innovation, regional thematic
partnerships, and the empowerment of women (25 grants were approved).
-----------------------Page 22 End-----------------------

                                                                                                  C/108/4
                                                                                                   Page 19


97.      IOM also supported home and host countries in engaging with diaspora through policy changes
in 28 countries and by mapping existing diaspora networks. For instance, in Argentina, the
Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, France, Jamaica, Jordan, Kyrgyzstan, the United Kingdom,
the United States and Zambia, IOM helped active diaspora members to transfer their skills to their
countries of origin. Development can be boosted through temporary return programmes for qualified
nationals in targeted sectors, such as those implemented by IOM in Afghanistan, Armenia, Burkina Faso,
Cameroon, Georgia, Ghana, Morocco, Nigeria, Sudan and Somalia. In addition, IOM supported the African
Union Commission in its work to produce the Diaspora Engagement Toolkit aimed at assisting
policymakers to design diaspora engagement strategies.

98.      Financial investment by diaspora groups can also contribute to development in home countries,
and investment mechanisms have been set up in Egypt and the Republic of Moldova in partnership with
the government or through innovative crowdfunding website platforms, such as in Austria.


OBJECTIVE 1: SOCIOECONOMIC WELL-BEING OF MIGRANTS AND SOCIETY

Safe and beneficial labour migration

99.        IOM is committed to promoting labour migration practices that benefit migrants, their families
and countries and communities of origin and destination, and that are business-friendly. In 2016,
48 per cent of IOM offices supported governments with research, analytical work, policy review and
facilitation of bilateral and multilateral dialogue on labour migration. IOM helped to share information on
labour migration by supporting databases, through job and skill matching, and by increasing capacity of
practitioners through training and study tours.

100.      In 2016, 31 offices trained government officials and private sector companies on the
importance of ethical labour recruitment in safeguarding the rights of migrant workers. Through IRIS, the
Organization continued bringing together government officials, multinational companies, employers,
experts, NGOs and trade unions. The IRIS Code of Conduct advised companies on how to adopt principles
of ethical recruitment in their day-to-day operations and business strategies throughout the supply chain.

101.     IOM improved understanding of international norms in 26 countries, and 14 offices reported an
improvement in the situation of migrant workers and job seekers. In India, Nepal and the
United Arab Emirates, IOM interviewed 120 agents and 20 employers to determine best practices in
labour mobility, which will inform decision-making. In the Dominican Republic, IOM provided technical
support on the regularization of migrant workers. IOM also initiated a large multi-year programme in the
Greater Mekong Subregion, to reduce poverty through safe migration, skills development and enhanced
job placement.

102.     Migrant protection is at the core of the Organization’s priorities. Considerable efforts have been
deployed across the globe to fight forced labour, exploitation and abuse and to empower migrant workers
to know their rights, provide them with pre-departure orientation and increase their integration prospects.
In 2016, 71,325 migrants (42% increase compared with 2015), comprising 92 nationalities, benefited
from pre-departure or post-arrival orientation sessions held in 70 countries worldwide. Of the migrants
who received training, 86 per cent were refugees or beneficiaries of international protection, and
14 per cent were migrant workers, individuals migrating for family reunification purposes or students.


Promoting social, economic and cultural inclusion of migrants

103.    In 2016, 87 IOM offices were contributing to the social inclusion (35%), labour market inclusion
(30%) and the cultural or political inclusion (28%) of migrants in countries of destination.
-----------------------Page 23 End-----------------------

C/108/4
Page 20


104.     The Organization’s focus is on helping migrants to better integrate into new communities, on
building the capacity of local authorities to receive new populations and on highlighting the positive
contributions that migrants can make to communities of destination. This two-way integration process is
essential for the existence of thriving, multicultural communities.

105.      IOM’s comprehensive approach to integration is multifaceted. Sixty-five offices were very active
in helping migrant workers or students integrate into their new country. In Poland, for instance, IOM runs
an information line for migrants and employers. Information on legal stay, work and study is also widely
provided through migrant information centres, or more informally through partners, and reaches an
average of 14,000 people per month.

106.      Over 50 offices reported that building partnerships with national and local authorities was key
to the success of this approach, both for migrants and local communities. These offices have been
supporting governments in designing, reviewing or implementing policies on migrant integration at
national or municipal level. As a result of IOM’s work in Czechia, Prague is adopting a municipal integration
policy. Also, IOM is supporting the development of a national policy on integration in Turkey.

107.      In addition, IOM provided governments and NGOs in 41 countries with training on migrants’
rights under the national legislation, as well as on migration and diversity management. The aim of this
training is to increase the intercultural skills of policymakers and practitioners. In the United Kingdom,
IOM provided information on Syrian refugees for local authorities and their counterparts (e.g. police
officers, health workers, teachers, social workers and volunteers). This approach, coupled with cultural
orientation for migrants, encourages two-way integration.

108.     IOM is acutely aware of the impact of public perception. In times of unprecedented mobility and
negative attitudes towards migrants and migration, initiatives in this area are necessary. In 2016, 72 IOM
offices were very active to address this. For instance, in Argentina, Georgia, Greece, Kazakhstan, Kuwait,
Nicaragua, Niger and Viet Nam, IOM promoted the positive image of migrants among host communities
by showing the positive contributions made by migrants and dispelling false ideas about them.

109.     The IOM i am a migrant campaign continued to challenge anti-migrant hate speech, by
celebrating migrants and presenting migrants’ stories in their own words. The campaign was widely
shared using social media. In Brussels, IOM partnered with the United Nations Regional Information
Centre for Western Europe and the European Economic and Social Committee for an event to raise
awareness of the plight of migrants arriving in Europe by sea, which was attended by 300 participants. In
Zambia, IOM worked with the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) and the Office of the United
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) on a campaign to promote safe migration and reduce
xenophobia and discrimination. IOM also developed activities under the Action to Protect and Assist
Vulnerable and Exploited Migrant Workers in the Middle East and North Africa project. In the United
Kingdom, IOM launched the Portraits of Welcome project, which used personal stories to give refugees a
sense of the community waiting for them in the United Kingdom. Owing to the Organization’s
communication strategy, IOM’s followers on social media also grew considerably in 2016, showing
increasing public interest in migration issues.

110.     The Organization aims to create a public dialogue on how communities welcome migrants to
counter the often hostile rhetoric commonly used in the media. As part of this effort, IOM trained media
professionals on balanced reporting of migration-related topics.

111.     Reintegration assistance in countries of origin is often essential to improve socioeconomic well-
being of returnees and enhance their inclusion in the community. It is therefore a crucial component of
assisted voluntary return and reintegration programmes. In 2016, IOM assisted approximately
40,000 returnees with financial support and in-kind assistance before departure or upon arrival in their
countries of origin. This assistance allowed migrants to address their immediate needs upon return and
contributed to their reintegration through education and training, small business set-up, medical support
or housing.
-----------------------Page 24 End-----------------------

                                                                                                      C/108/4
                                                                                                       Page 21


112.      In addition, in view of the important role played by communities in the reintegration of returning
migrants, IOM implemented several projects targeting communities in countries such as Azerbaijan,
Gambia, Guinea-Bissau, Mali, Nigeria and Senegal through various activities, including in the areas of
agriculture, fishing and livelihood support. Furthermore, at the structural level, IOM engaged in initiatives
aimed at reinforcing local capacities to deliver reintegration-related services. In Tunisia, for instance, IOM
participated in consultations with the Government and civil society to promote the inclusion of provisions
on reintegration in the Anti-Trafficking in Persons Law. In Georgia, IOM supported the ongoing
development of a guidebook for service providers in the field of reintegration assistance, in coordination
with the State Commission on Migration Issues and NGO partners.

113.       As part of this comprehensive approach to migrant reintegration, IOM and the EU developed a
joint initiative for migrant protection and reintegration to support the efforts of partner countries in Africa
to strengthen migration management and respond to the urgent protection needs of migrants along the
central Mediterranean route. This initiative is funded by the EU Emergency Trust Fund for Africa, with
additional contributions from Germany and Italy, for a total of approximately EUR 143 million. It targets
14 African countries with the aim of strengthening their capacities to address complex migration; increase
protection and assistance for vulnerable and stranded migrants; provide voluntary return assistance for
migrants wishing to return home and support their reintegration; promote safe and informed migration;
and improve data on migration flows and migrant needs and vulnerabilities. With regard to the migration
routes from the Horn of Africa, the EU and IOM joined forces to support the development and
implementation of rights-based, development-based and sustainable return and reintegration policies
through an initiative on sustainable and dignified return and reintegration in support of the Khartoum
Process, with a total estimated cost of EUR 25 million.

Facilitating cost-effective remittances in support of development

114.      In 2016, 38 IOM offices supported almost 12,000 members of the diaspora and their relatives
to improve their financial and economic well-being. The development role of diaspora considerably relies
on the effective transfer of remittances. To optimize the use and impact of remittances, 16 offices were
working on reducing transfer costs and 12 offices on improving the financial skills of diaspora members
to help them reach their business potential – 576 businesses benefited from IOM support.

115.      In Georgia, for instance, IOM has been facilitating access to funding for diaspora-led businesses
through a diaspora portal. The Organization also produced a study on crowdfunding in Austria. In Ukraine,
based on research on migrant remittances and savings, IOM plans to explore innovative mechanisms for
attracting and facilitating diaspora investment in Ukraine. IOM also helped to foster links among the
Moldovan diaspora and enabled them to launch 25 new initiatives, which will contribute to the direct
engagement of the diaspora and migrant communities in the economic, sociocultural and educational
development of their homeland.

Tackling human trafficking, migrant exploitation and abuse

116.     IOM has been tackling human trafficking and other forms of migrant exploitation for decades.
In 2016, 80 per cent of IOM offices reported that they were contributing to the prevention of and response
to human trafficking, exploitation and abuse. Half of the programmes addressing these issues had
particular considerations for migrant children.

117.     The Organization’s work in this area in 2016 was varied; it assisted victims directly; trained
national authorities, practitioners and media; contributed to national or local strategies; and worked on
public campaigns and global initiatives.

118.      IOM provided direct assistance to over 8,500 victims of human trafficking and associated forms
of exploitation and abuse. IOM assistance includes safe accommodation, medical and psychosocial
support, and assisted voluntary return and reintegration and aims to give beneficiaries the chance to lead
a new life.
-----------------------Page 25 End-----------------------

C/108/4
Page 22


119.      IOM trained 33,000 government officials, NGO staff and others in 100 countries on prevention,
detection, prosecution and response to trafficking in persons and associated forms of exploitation and
abuse. Fifty-four IOM offices produced new training and guidance materials on best practices, systems,
mechanisms and tools to effectively protect vulnerable migrants, including victims of trafficking. Training
of trainers has also been effective in Belize, Somalia and Papua New Guinea, among others, where more
victims have been identified by trained law enforcement officers, and more perpetrators have been
sentenced.

120.     In Afghanistan, IOM trained 30 journalists, after which a local media outlet broadcast and
published three stories on trafficking in persons relating to child marriage and forced labour. In the
Lao People’s Democratic Republic, local radio volunteers who had received training delivered safe
migration radio programmes in three languages, reaching around 200,000 people a week in remote
locations of the country.

121.      IOM training also contributed to the development of national training curriculum for practitioners
(e.g. psychosocial service providers in shelters in Thailand and police officers in Zimbabwe). IOM also
conducted multi-country studies on labour exploitation, trafficking and migrant health in Argentina,
Kazakhstan and Peru and provided recommendations to multiple sectors to reduce health vulnerabilities
related to occupational hazards, abuse and poor living conditions for labour migrants.

122.      The Organization provided technical support to national authorities and CSOs to design policies
and practices and promote compliance with international standards. During the year, IOM implemented
the Mapping of Smuggling of Migrants and Trafficking in Human Beings in the Western Balkans project.
In Slovenia, IOM facilitated a review of the national referral mechanism to be used by field workers during
emergency response. In the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, IOM developed trafficking indicators
for use in crisis situations. In Turkmenistan, IOM provided technical support and expertise to contribute
to the development and implementation of the National Action Plan to Combat Human Trafficking
2016–2018.

123.     Trafficking in persons is a transnational issue. In 2016, IOM improved information-sharing and
cooperation procedures between relevant authorities and organizations by bringing together decision
makers and practitioners at national level (Italy) or regional level (Belgium, Jamaica, Switzerland).

124.       IOM continued to conduct campaigns to raise public awareness about the plight of victims and
risks of trafficking. Seventy IOM offices worked on national or global campaigns against trafficking. Thirty-
nine offices monitored and evaluated their campaigns: for 97 per cent of them, the campaigns had been
effective. Events for the World Day against Trafficking in Persons (30 July) and the EU Anti-Trafficking Day
(18 October) were particularly well received by the public. The Finnish campaign What is the price of a
human being?, replicated by other IOM offices, reached approximately 1.2 million people.

125.     The Organization joined the Global Action to Prevent and Address Trafficking in Persons and the
Smuggling of Migrants, the initiative led by UNODC, which is being implemented in 13 strategically located
countries across Africa, Asia, Eastern Europe and Latin America.

      Type of exploitation experienced by victims of human trafficking, 2005–2016 (in %)




126.      In 2016, the IOM Global Assistance Fund enlarged its scope to provide direct, emergency
protection and assistance not only to victims of trafficking, but also to unaccompanied or separated
migrant children; migrants subject to or at risk of exploitation, abuse and violence, and migrants in
extreme psychological and physical distress. In 2016, the Fund received its largest single contribution
since its creation in 2000, amounting to over USD 500,000, which made it possible to better address the
increasing requests for protection by large groups of migrants. During the year, the Fund assisted
274 vulnerable migrants.

Health of migrants and migration-affected communities

127.      Health is a crucial component for the integration of migrants. IOM’s vision of “healthy migrants
in healthy communities” is centred on four key approaches: (a) promoting migrants’ right to health;
(b) maintaining good public health outcomes (for individuals and communities); (c) contributing to the
positive health and development outcomes of migration (in countries of origin, transit and destination);
and (d) reducing health inequities. In 2016, 63 per cent of IOM offices reported active engagement in
health-related activities (compared to 58% in 2015).

128.     In over 40 countries, the Organization increased government capacity to manage health issues
associated with migration and improved the monitoring of migrants’ health data. This is crucial to gain a
better understanding of migrants’ health and needs, encourage equitable access to health services for
migrants, monitor the implementation of relevant policies and work towards policy coherence.

129.     In addition, IOM provided training and consultations on migration and health for health
professionals, law enforcement officers and social workers in 59 countries, to enhance their
understanding of health-related border policies and procedures and the health challenges faced by
migrant populations.

130.      In 69 countries, IOM worked to directly increase migrants’ access to health services. For
instance, IOM’s network of seven clinics in South Sudan increased the services provided to vulnerable
internally displaced persons. Within a six-month period, IOM had provided over 130,000 consultations
against the background of a declining economy, a breakdown of health services and an escalation of
violent conflict. In Lebanon, the need for primary health-care support is evident: IOM continued to record
over 5,000 consultations per month in the centres it supports. In several countries, IOM’s vaccination
and hygiene campaigns reached out to more migrants and their families.

131.      IOM’s EQUI-HEALTH project continued to seek to improve migrants’ access to health-care
services and to enhance health promotion and prevention to meet the needs of migrants, the Roma and
other vulnerable groups in the European region. One of the project’s components, the Migrant Integration
Policy Index, in which a health strand was added, monitors policies affecting migrant integration in all
EU countries, Australia, Canada, Iceland, Japan, the Republic of Korea, New Zealand, Norway,
Switzerland, Turkey and the United States.

132.       Furthermore, IOM launched the RE-HEALTH project. This project, also being implemented in the
European region, aims to establish links between key reception areas for refugees and migrants and the
health systems, to expand use of the established personal health record and the accompanying
Handbook for Health Professionals to evaluate the health status and needs of refugees and migrants
arriving in the region, and to ensure that health assessments and preventive measures are implemented.

133.     IOM also promoted migrants’ access to health, HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis services in Eastern
Europe and Central Asia, in collaboration with the Office of the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for
HIV/AIDS in Eastern Europe and Central Asia. In the Middle East, IOM continued advocacy and assisted
refugees and migrants with programmes against tuberculosis and malaria (e.g. in Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon,
the Syrian Arab Republic and Yemen). In North Africa, the Organization is promoting migrant health by
building practitioners’ capacity in Egypt, Libya, Morocco, Tunisia and Yemen. IOM is also implementing
migration health programmes for vulnerable migrants and internally displaced persons, for instance in
Colombia and Argentina. In the Islamic Republic of Iran, IOM supported the Government to bolster the
accessibility of health services offered to Afghan migrants and refugees.

OBJECTIVE 2: MOBILITY DIMENSION OF CRISES

IOM’s comprehensive approach to crises

134.     Overall in 2016, IOM crisis-related programming reached over 26 million people.

135.     The IOM Migration Crisis Operational Framework (MCOF) continued to guide the Organization’s
comprehensive approach to operations before, during and after a crisis. Drawing on MCOF for strategic
planning ensures that the immediate humanitarian and protection needs of beneficiaries are met, while
addressing the root causes of crises, building resilience and promoting long-term solutions. This approach
gives IOM a unique comparative advantage for strengthening action on the humanitarian–development
nexus, a current priority of humanitarian reforms, and was used in 52 countries to coordinate with host
governments on their crisis-related work. In several locations, planning sessions were held with external
partners and stakeholders, introducing the MCOF approach and the related humanitarian policy
frameworks.

136.      As part of the IASC, IOM supported coordination among clusters and sectoral coordination
groups across 34 countries. IOM’s role varied from that of coordinator or co-coordinator, to working group
or task force convener. These coordination forums involved camp coordination and camp management
(CCCM) and displacement-related management in 13 countries; shelter, non-food items (NFIs) and
housing in 16 countries; and merged sectoral coordination of both in a further ten countries.

137.      Since 2014, IOM has made concerted efforts to mainstream gender-based violence prevention
and risk mitigation into the Organization’s emergency response programming. In 2016, these efforts,
which had previously targeted DTM and CCCM staff and partners, were extended to shelter and
settlement actors. In addition to training its staff, IOM trained national authorities and local actors to
better anticipate, recognize and address protection concerns of women and girls in camp and camp-like
settings. The training is often co-facilitated by specialists in gender-based violence and covers aspects
such as camp safety audits, survivor-centred approaches and the delivery of psychological first aid.

Crisis preparedness

138.      As part of IOM efforts to strengthen crisis preparedness, 21 of its offices in emergency-prone
regions now have warehouse stocks of NFIs. Furthermore, 15 offices have signed long-term agreements
with NFI suppliers to access high-quality items at reduced costs. During 2016, IOM’s pre-positioned global
NFI stocks supported responses in Burundi, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Fiji, the
United Republic of Tanzania and Yemen.

139.     In Myanmar and Ecuador, IOM delivered training to government officials and partners on the
Mend Guide: Comprehensive Guide for Planning Mass Evacuations in Natural Disasters. The Government
of Vanuatu requested IOM and the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs to organize a
United Nations Disaster Assessment and Coordination Team (UNDAC) mass evacuation preparedness
mission in the context of volcanic eruptions. A similar UNDAC mission took place in Cabo Verde.

140.     Throughout 2016, IOM also provided governments and humanitarian partners with training on
CCCM (mostly in natural disaster contexts), the DTM, shelter and gender-based violence mainstreaming.
The CCCM training, which took place in 45 countries, aimed to strengthen the ability of partners and
national and local authorities to respond to new disasters and migration situations and promote disaster
risk reduction. In addition, 34 IOM offices developed a contingency plan, a third of which were co-written
by the host government.

Emergency response

141.      In 2016, IOM supported humanitarian operations in more than 77 countries, including for the
three ongoing system-wide Level 3 emergencies, in Iraq, the Syrian Arab Republic and Yemen, and for
two institutional (or “corporate”) Level 3 emergencies (Nigeria and South Sudan). The Organization’s
-----------------------Page 29 End-----------------------

emergency response continues to be timely and efficient. IOM deployed rapid response officers from
Headquarters for surge support for CCCM, shelter, DTM and emergency operations in 46 different
locations, and for capacity-building in 34 destinations.

142.    IOM counted on its long-standing partnerships to deploy experts from six of its standby partners 2
to 19 Country Offices through 38 field deployments, representing 4,388 days of personnel service. 3

143.     The Organization was active in CCCM in at least 46 countries. It assumed a leadership or co-
leadership role in 34 countries where the CCCM Cluster was formally activated, or where sectoral
coordination groups were established (e.g. the Central African Republic, Chad, Ecuador, Iraq, Nigeria,
South Sudan and Yemen) or working groups were active during the preparedness phase. To enhance
camp management functions, the global partnership with the Women’s Refugee Commission continued
to strengthen women’s participation in camp governance structures and develop guidance on how to
support women’s engagement. IOM also provided hardware, engaging extensively in site selection,
planning and development; camp care and maintenance; and rehabilitation services in multiple
operations, notably in Iraq, Nigeria and South Sudan. In these operations, there was continued need for
safe, secure and accessible displacement sites for those affected by continuing conflict and new shocks.

144.     As Global CCCM Cluster co-lead with UNHCR, IOM contributed to the finalization of a five-year
strategy (2017–2021) aimed at establishing equitable access to assistance, protection and services,
improving quality of life and dignity for people during displacement, and seeking durable solutions
worldwide. The establishment of the Global Strategic Advisory Group in 2016 enhanced the inclusiveness
and transparency of the Global CCCM Cluster. IOM remained the global leader in CCCM capacity-building,
maintaining the Camp Management Toolkit, and a roster of qualified CCCM trainers. To make knowledge
more accessible, an e-learning platform was developed. In line with the localization agenda, focus shifted
from investing in external experts to training national CCCM trainers in high-risk countries.

145.     Health support is essential in humanitarian contexts, and, throughout 2016, IOM supported
humanitarian health assistance in 19 countries. The Organization also started to build capacity in a
number of countries in public health emergency preparedness and response, and in preventing, detecting
and responding to health threats in relation to migration and human mobility (e.g. in the Democratic
Republic of the Congo, Ghana, Guinea-Bissau, Guinea, Liberia, Mauritania, Senegal and Sierra Leone).

146.     IOM continued to have a major role in inter-agency shelter and NFI coordination, leading, co-
leading or supporting clusters and working groups, in both emergency and recovery phases of response
in 24 countries, including Ethiopia, Haiti, Nigeria, Pakistan and South Sudan. In terms of operations, IOM
provided shelter and NFI assistance to 4.65 million people in 2016. Highlights included the response to
Hurricane Matthew in Haiti and the management of a common pipeline for NFI and shelter materials in
South Sudan, and in Iraq, where IOM managed a large-scale shelter programme.

147.     IOM has a growing portfolio of water, sanitation and hygiene programming, assisting 3.33 million
people in 30 countries in 2016. This included providing 1.27 million people with access to safe water,
438,000 with safe latrines, 546,000 with sanitation-related activities and 1.63 million with hygiene
promotion activities. IOM programmes in this area doubled in 2016 in Somalia, South Sudan and Yemen.

148.     Throughout 2016, IOM positioned the DTM as a central component for informing humanitarian
responses. The DTM has become a key data reference for governments, partners and the humanitarian
community. The DTM was active in 44 countries, including new operations in 13 countries. During the
year, a combined total of more than 90,000 users visited the Global DTM website, which provided a
central repository for all publicly available data and information products from countries with DTM
operations, and the Migration Flows Portal. The Organization continued to enhance DTM tools and

methodologies for protection mainstreaming, as well as to consolidate best practices on data management,
data protection, and ethical and accountable use of humanitarian data.

149.     In 2016, the IOM Migration Emergency Funding Mechanism was used to quickly respond to
humanitarian needs in Ecuador, Fiji and Yemen. Since its establishment in 2011, the Mechanism has
been critical in bridging the funding gap between the start-up of emergency operations and the
subsequent receipt of donor contributions in the Central African Republic, Ethiopia, Nepal, Nigeria and
the Syrian Arab Republic, among others. With support from 12 donor countries, over one third of the
USD 30 million funding target has been raised. Making further progress towards this target remains one
of IOM’s goals. In addition, funding emergency projects that have received a loan from the Mechanism is
essential for IOM to optimize the Mechanism’s utility.

Stabilization and post-crisis transition and recovery

150.       Protracted displacement has become the norm, with the average length of displacement being
between 17 and 23 years for conflict-induced displacement. This, in conjunction with the anticipated
effects of climate change and the socio-political reactions to the high volume of mixed migration flows
arriving in Europe, led to renewed attention being paid to the humanitarian–development nexus in 2016.
IOM has for many years recognized and advocated for strengthening this nexus at operational and
multilateral levels.

151.     Through its Progressive Resolution of Displacement Situations Framework, launched in late
2016, IOM has broken new ground in applying mobility considerations to support the development of
sustainable solutions. The Organization’s inclusive approach to displacement focuses on strengthening
coping capacities, promoting self-reliance and creating environments conducive to the resolution of
displacement situations. In 2016, IOM applied the Framework in Haiti, Mali, Papua New Guinea and
Ukraine and launched new programmes in Iraq, Uganda, the Marshall Islands and the Syrian Arab
Republic. At the end of the year, 42 offices were engaged in activities that support the wider efforts to
progressively resolve displacement situations.

152.      The Organization’s community stabilization work continued to play a key role in over
40 countries to prevent the recurrence of displacement during crises or in fragile contexts. A number of
large-scale community stabilization programmes continued in 2016 in various countries, including the
Central African Republic, Colombia, Iraq, Niger, Pakistan and Ukraine. New stabilization programmes were
launched in Azerbaijan, Burundi, Chad, Kenya and Sudan. IOM also supported programmes to counter
violent extremism. These programmes provided capacity-building support to at-risk youth, created
opportunities for their socioeconomic and civic participation to prevent radicalism and promoted the
overall stabilization of fragile regions.

153.     In pursuit of sustainable post-conflict disarmament, demobilization and reintegration, IOM
supports the reintegration of ex-combatants in Colombia, while investing in the prevention of youth
recruitment. The success of these programmes is largely due to close engagement with host
communities. In Somalia, IOM held a community forgiveness ceremony for former combatants who had
graduated from the IOM transition centre, to help ensure their acceptance by community members. In
addition to traditional disarmament, demobilization and reintegration programming, IOM launched a
community violence reduction initiative in the Central African Republic.

154.      IOM provided electoral assistance and supported election observation missions in Guinea, Haiti
and Uganda. In early 2016, the Organization also designed a strategy for post-crisis out-of-country voting
in the Syrian Arab Republic.

155.     Disaster risk reduction activities were carried out in Afghanistan, Haiti, Indonesia, the Federated
States of Micronesia, Myanmar and Timor-Leste. The Organization’s expertise in this field helped
strengthen emergency operation centres, climate and disaster risk education, resilience-building and
disaster management planning. In the Federated States of Micronesia and Papua New Guinea, IOM
enhanced the capacity of local communities to adapt to climate change.

156.       Land and property issues can also affect the stability of communities. IOM conducted several
in-depth assessments in 2016, including on needs and rights violations arising from the displacement
crisis in Iraq. The findings of a study among displaced Syrians across south-eastern Turkey and in the
Syrian Arab Republic will inform the wider Syrian humanitarian crisis response relating to land issues. In
Nepal, IOM continued its long-standing engagement to develop a national transition plan for the
implementation of a land reform.

157.      In Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, IOM started
the new phase of the Roma Holocaust Survivors Programme, through which NGO partners provide various
types of assistance to elderly and vulnerable Roma Holocaust survivors.

158.      In Nepal, the Empowering Women 4 Women project, for which IOM is one of the implementing
agencies, enabled the Nepalese parliament to launch the Declaration of Commitment to Gender-
responsive Land Policies. Simultaneously, IOM worked closely with other partners in Nepal to address the
lack of recognition of and support for victims of conflict-related sexual violence. It also continued its
support for the comprehensive and transparent reparations policy for victims of the country’s civil war.
Also with regard to reparations, IOM engagement has been instrumental in building the capacity of
national institutions implementing the Victims and Land Restitution Law in Colombia.

Resettlement and movement management

159.      Moving vulnerable migrants and refugees to safety is a core function of the Organization.
Whether to mitigate the consequences of forced displacement or maximize the benefits of planned
migration, IOM’s movement operations continue to grow in complexity and scope. In 2016, the
Humanitarian Evacuation Cell remained an active support for IOM Field Offices in organizing urgent
humanitarian evacuation movements in remote and dangerous locations such, as Afghanistan, Iraq,
Libya, the Syrian Arab Republic and Yemen.

160.     Resettlement is a vital international protection tool and provides a durable solution for the most
vulnerable. In 2016, IOM supported some 39 States in carrying out resettlement, humanitarian admission
and relocation initiatives from 123 countries of departure for over 204,900 refugees and other vulnerable
persons of concern, with significant operations out of Afghanistan, Iraq, Jordan, Kenya, Lebanon, Turkey
and the United Republic of Tanzania. IOM’s commitment goes beyond the transportation of refugees. In
2016, the Organization increased its efforts to help countries receive and integrate larger numbers of
refugees, which included the addition of new orientation and training programmes. Currently, IOM
provides pre-departure orientation to refugees resettling to 16 various countries as well as to
beneficiaries of international protection bound for over 20 countries in the European Economic Area
within the context of the relocation programme.


OBJECTIVE 3: SAFE, ORDERLY AND DIGNIFIED MIGRATION

Safe and regular migration

161.      IOM promotes safe and regular migration and supports governments and migrants to optimize
the potential of migration for the benefit of all. In 2016, 107 IOM offices were engaged in the promotion
of safe and regular migration by providing technical assistance to governments, pre-departure orientation
to migrants and support to migrant resource centres, promoting safe migration campaigns among the
wider public and contributing to programmes that facilitate circular, labour and educational migration.

162.      In support of well-administered visa and entry schemes, IOM facilitates access to regular
migration channels by delivering services to governments and migrants, primarily through operating or
supporting visa-processing centres, which provide administrative support to process humanitarian, family
reunification and resident visas. The services available include visa application data capture and transfer,
visa application completeness checks, identity checks, biometrics enrolment, visa appointment
scheduling, interview facilitation, document verification, visa-fee processing, visa application tracking and
facilitated travel.

                                                                                                      C/108/4
                                                                                                       Page 29


163.     The facilitated migration services provided by IOM are designed to empower migrants by
providing them with accurate information in their native language in a timely manner, among other means
of assistance, to simplify visa application processes. In turn, Member States benefit from streamlined
and cost-effective visa-related procedures. In 2016, IOM provided facilitated migration services to
212,226 persons (31.7% increase compared with 2015).

164.     In addition, the Family Assistance Programme provided services in support of the reunification
of vulnerable Syrian families in Germany, assisting over 21,000 families (over 84,000 beneficiaries) with
the application process, either remotely or in-person at one of the three service centres, located in Turkey
and Lebanon. The Programme has the objective of promoting safe, orderly and dignified migration by
dissuading vulnerable migrants seeking to reunite with their relatives in Germany from resorting to often
unscrupulous visa brokers or unsafe and irregular means through smugglers.

Assisted voluntary return and reintegration

165.     IOM considers assisted voluntary return and reintegration to be a humane and dignified
approach to support migrants who are unwilling or unable to stay in a host or transit country and wish to
return voluntarily to their country of origin. It is a core activity conducted by the Organization for migrants
and IOM Member States across the world.

166.     In 2016, IOM assisted over 98,000 migrants (68% male, 32% female) to return home voluntarily,
from 112 host countries to 162 countries of origin. While most beneficiaries (83%) returned from the
European Economic Area and Switzerland, recent trends indicate that South–South returns are also
increasing. For instance, assisted voluntary returns from Morocco and Niger amounted to more than
6 per cent of the total assisted voluntary returns. Furthermore, returns from Turkey and Western Balkan
countries increased following recent shifts in migration routes.

167.     The provision of tailored return assistance is critical for vulnerable migrants who may have
particular protection needs, for instance, unaccompanied migrant children, single mothers, migrants with
health problems, victims of trafficking and stranded migrants. In 2016, over 3 per cent of those benefiting
from assisted voluntary return were vulnerable migrants.

Health and immigration

168.     IOM is entrusted by many countries to carry out health assessments and provide travel health
assistance to refugees and migrants ahead of resettlement or immigration. These services help to reduce
the impact of population mobility on public health in receiving countries and facilitate the integration of
migrants through the early detection and cost-effective management of health conditions.

169.      Through its comprehensive pre-departure health assessment services, IOM ensures that all
migrants travelling under the auspices of the Organization are fit to travel and receive necessary health
assistance before, during and upon completing their journey. In 2016, IOM carried out nearly
440,000 health assessments in over 80 countries around the world for refugees in the resettlement
pipeline and migrants applying for various categories of immigration visas. In Jordan alone, IOM’s health
assessment team in Amman provided over 36,000 pre-departure health assessments for refugees (95%)
and visa applicants (5%).

Border and identity management solutions

170.      Sound border management is critical to ensuring the security of countries and the safety and
dignity of migrants; it also facilitates trade and the movement of cross-border communities. Immigration
and border management is one of IOM’s core areas of engagement, with over half of IOM offices (52%
compared with 45% in 2015) reporting engagement in this area in 2016. The Organization supported
States on border-related data management and provided operational systems for identity and information
management.

171.      In 2016, IOM carried out various activities aimed at facilitating cross-border cooperation
between State agencies operating at borders, for instance, between Belarus and Ukraine, Tajikistan and
Afghanistan, and countries of the Western Balkans. The Organization launched a pre-arrival information
exchange system (PRINEX) between the customs authorities of Belarus and Ukraine which reduced the
waiting time at the border and enhanced the risk analysis capacity of the customs officers. IOM also
supported member countries of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) by examining
the opportunities and challenges associated with the roll-out of a national biometric identity card for
ECOWAS countries.

172.     Lastly, in light of the ongoing challenges related to mixed migration flows, IOM significantly
scaled up its humanitarian border management programming to ensure that States are better equipped
to deal with influxes of refugees and migrants during crises. The programme includes assessments of
current border management procedures, contingency planning and technical assistance. Countries that
have benefited from the programme, such as some Western Balkan countries and Turkey, reported an
increased level of preparedness and capacity.

Stranded migrants

173.      In addition to assisted voluntary return and reintegration, IOM assisted 793 stranded individuals
of 50 different nationalities in 2016 (compared with 524 in 2015) through its Humanitarian Assistance
for Stranded Migrants mechanism. The mechanism offers return assistance to vulnerable migrants for
whom no other assistance is available. It enables IOM to quickly help stranded migrants to return home
voluntarily, safely and with dignity.
