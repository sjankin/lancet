In 2016, CIDI recommended the Inter-American Program for Sustainable Development (PIDS)
(2016-2021) and the Inter-American Program for the Promotion and Protection of the Human
Rights of Migrants, Including Migrant Workers and Their Families for adoption by the General
Assembly. The former sets out strategic measures for aligning the work of the General
Secretariat with efforts to implement the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the
Paris Agreement on climate change; the latter seeks to promote dialogue and cooperation
among states, international organizations, and other actors on advancement and protection of
the human rights of all migrants, recognizing the contribution of migrants to integral
development.

As part of its thematic meetings, CIDI identified strategic topics, which included experiences
with public-private partnerships; challenges and opportunities in ensuring quality education;
experiences in poverty reduction and fostering social inclusion; implementation of the Sendai
Framework and the Regional Plan of Action for Disaster Risk Reduction; and the potential role of
the OAS in assisting states in ensuring access to affordable, reliable, and sustainable energy.
Partnerships were also explored with the Pan American Development Foundation and the Trust
for the Americas.

In the wake of the Twenty-first session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations
Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP21), CIDI held two joint meetings with the
Permanent Council at which the outcomes of that event were set out.

CIDI authorized the withdrawal of more than US$5 million from the Capital Fund to make up for
the cuts in the budget allocated by the Regular Fund to the OAS Scholarship and Training
Program in 2016 and 2017 [CIDI/RES. 309 (E-IV/16) and CIDI/RES. 316 (LXV-O/16)]. It also
established an immediate and temporary pause in the award of new graduate scholarships in
2017 and set up a working group to analyze and review the operations of all OAS scholarship
and training programs.

          (CIDI/REMDES/doc.6/16 rev. 1) whose aims include, inter alia, to strengthen regional

          services. The states undertook to enhance their national policies in support of micro,
          small, and medium-size enterprises involved in cultural and creative industries. Barbados
          and Guatemala offered to host the next two meetings in 2018 and 2020, respectively.
         The Tenth Meeting of the Inter-American Committee on Ports (CIP) held in Montevideo,

          on Ports: Agreements of Montevideo 2016–2018,” with a view to promoting public
          policies and the establishment of strategic partnerships, in particular with the private
          sector. It also adopted the Plan of Action of Montevideo 2016–2018 (CIDI/CIP/doc.6/16
          rev. 4) and recommended a number of amendments to the CIP Rules of Procedure for
          approval by CIDI. Mexico offered to host the eleventh meeting in 2018.

2         GENERAL SECRETARIAT

Chapter XVI of the Charter describes the functions and attributes of the General Secretariat, the
OAS’ central and permanent organ headquartered in Washington, D.C. Elected by the General
Assembly, the Secretary General directs the General Secretariat, serves as its legal
representative and participates in all meetings of the Organization with voice but without vote.
It is the Secretary General’s responsibility to establish whatever offices he deems necessary
within the General Secretariat, to determine the number of staff members, appoint them, and
regulate their duties and functions.


2.1       OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY GENERAL

In the second year of his term, Secretary General Luis Almagro devoted his efforts to tackling
the immediate challenges facing the region, particularly those that threaten to undermine

                                                   6
-----------------------Page 9 End-----------------------

democracy, one of the pillars of the Organization and the principles set down in the OAS Charter
and the Inter-American Democratic Charter.

In 2016, the Secretary General focused on facilitating solutions to the Hemisphere’s most
pressing problems in areas in which the OAS can make a difference:

   -   He reaffirmed his commitment to Venezuela and, for the first time, succeeded in having
       the Permanent Council discuss the situation in that country. In letters addressed to the
       country’s president and other Venezuelan officials, the Secretary General persisted in his
       calls for the release of political prisoners, whose number has increased; respect for
       democratic institutions and the rights of all Venezuelans; and the restoration of social
       peace. Mr. Almagro also submitted a detailed report on the situation in Venezuela to the
       Permanent Council and, following the decision of Venezuela's National Electoral Council
       to suspend the collection of signatures for holding a recall referendum, appealed to the
       region's countries to take concrete steps to defend democracy in Venezuela and to look
       for ways to reach a practical solution in line with the procedures and obligations
       adopted in the Inter-American Democratic Charter.
   -   He continued the efforts to combat corruption in Honduras through the OAS Mission to
       Support the Fight against Corruption and Impunity in Honduras (MACCIH/OAS). He also
       reaffirmed the Organization's commitment to the peace process in Colombia by
       expanding the mandate of the Mission to Support the Peace Process in Colombia
       (MAPP/OAS), which will monitor post-conflict challenges, risks, and threats to peace.
   -   He initiated a constructive dialogue with the Government of Nicaragua for strengthening
       democratic institutions in accordance with the country's commitments under the legal
       instruments of the inter-American system and its domestic system of rules. The dialogue
       covered the introduction of international electoral observation, strengthening the
       system of political representation, ensuring separation of powers, and the drafting of a
       joint report to clarify the democratic situation in Nicaragua.

The Secretary General also expressed his commitment to the Organization's fiscal management
and internal budgetary challenges. To that end, he adopted a policy of fiscal austerity in order to
diversify financing and ensure greater participation for other states that benefit from the OAS.
In 2016, he introduced a spending cut of 12.8 percent, which generated savings of US$10.8
million.

In 2016, the Secretary General was honored with a series of awards and distinctions for his work
in defense of human rights and democracy in the Hemisphere:

   -   In Canada he was named one of the 10 most influential Hispanic people, an award that
       the Canadian Hispanic Business Alliance has given out for the past 10 years.
   -   He received the Oswaldo Payá Liberty and Life Prize for his “outstanding efforts in
       defense of democracy.” The Latin American Youth Network for Democracy announced
       that Mr. Almagro was awarded the prize for “his coherent response to the political and
       social junctures through which certain countries experiencing crisis and democratic

                                                7
-----------------------Page 10 End-----------------------

       regression in Latin America are traversing.” The award is given to people or institutions
       who have stood out for their effective promotion and defense of human rights, life, and
       democracy.
   - Secretary General Almagro also received an award from the Inter-American Institute for
       Democracy (IID). Headed by Carlos Alberto Montaner, the IID chose Mr. Almagro as the
       winner of the 2016 Francisco Miranda Prize for his committed “defense of liberty and
       democracy in the Americas.”
   - The Secretary General was also selected to receive one of the awards bestowed annually
       by the Ibero-American Association of Communication (ASICOM) at a ceremony in the
       Paraninfo Hall at the University of Oviedo, Spain. Sergio Jellinek, the Secretary General’s
       strategic communications adviser, received the award on his behalf.
   - The Secretary General was awarded the 2016 Mark Palmer Prize, which the Community
       of Democracies gives to diplomats or international officials in recognition of their work
       to strengthen democracy and promote human rights.
   - He was also the recipient of the TIC-Americas 2016 “Entrepreneur of the Year” Award
       granted by the Young American Business Trust in June 2016.
With his sights set on the future, the Secretary General is committed to forging ahead on these
and other matters that require attention in the region, including human rights issues in Cuba
and increasing challenges to democracy in the region.

2.1.1 Office of Protocol

The Office of Protocol plans and coordinates the official ceremonies of the political bodies of
the Organization. It serves as liaison between the U.S. Department of State and the permanent
missions on matters related to registration and visas for staff of the missions and to the
privileges and immunities of diplomats accredited to the Organization. It also organizes and
coordinates the use of the Main Building for protocolary or social-cultural functions and prints

The Office of Protocol also coordinated a program of four “Country Weeks,” in which member
states and observers are allocated a week in which to stage cultural or academic events. Almost
all ceremonies to mark the signing, deposit, or ratification of protocols and other agreements
between the Organization and member states or other entities were organized by this Office–
some 68 ceremonies in all.

During the regular session of the General Assembly in the Dominican Republic, coordination
services were provided for 117 bilateral meetings. Apart from organizing two agreement
signings/ceremonies, the Office of Protocol also staged breakfasts with CARICOM and SICA. It
also organized the reception offered by the Secretary General and the Assistant Secretary
General, which was canceled at the last minute. It arranged a private working luncheon of the
Secretary General.

Use of the Main Building involves drawing up written contracts between the Organization and
users, coordinating the logistical support the OAS provides for events, and following up on user
payments. In 2016, 84 events – receptions, luncheons, dinners, and conferences – were held.
The Office of Protocol provided assistance for the Food Festival of the Americas organized by
the Organization of Women of the Americas. It also organized and coordinated three receptions
at the Secretary General’s residence.

The Office of Protocol reviewed and keyed some 3,250 applications by the permanent missions
and their staff into the “e-gov.” system set up by the Department of State for submission of
applications. Visas were obtained for senior OAS staff and 605 letters were written to obtain
driving licenses for OAS staff and non-diplomatic staff of the permanent missions. The Office
processed nine accreditations for the Secretary General and senior OAS staff to attend United
Nations meetings. The Office served as liaison with the State Department Escort Service and
with airlines to arrange for the Secretary General’s travel within the United States, submitting
35 petitions.

PAHO-OAS Collaboration: Preparing the Americas Region to Achieve the Sustainable
Development Goals

In the first quarter of 2016, The Assistant Secretary General chaired an OAS-PAHO high-level
working group comprising the Executive Secretary for Integral Development, the Executive
Secretary for Access to Rights and Equity, the Executive Secretary for Hemispheric Affairs, and
the Assistant Director of PAHO. Its task was to seek greater coordination between the two
organizations in implementing the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

The working group negotiated a declaration of cooperation between PAHO and the OAS, which
was signed by their respective heads on August 19, 2016. The declaration sets out the activities
on which the organizations will cooperate in the areas of equity, social inclusion, and social
determinants of health in the region. The working group also drew up a work plan.

Cooperation between Inter-Regional Organizations and Financial Institutions

In September 2016, the Assistant Secretary General chaired a
meeting of regional organizations and international financial
institutions to look at ways to improve cooperation with a view
to enhancing collaboration, avoiding overlap, and maximizing
impact. The meeting was attended by the secretaries general
of the Association of Caribbean States (ACS) and of the
Secretariat for Central American Economic Integration (SIECA)
as well as representatives of the Caribbean Community
(CARICOM), Central American Bank for Economic Integration
(BCIE), Inter-American Development Bank (IADB), CAF -

Development Bank of Latin America, the Economic Commission for Latin America and the
Caribbean (ECLAC), and the World Bank.

At a teleconference held in January 2017, the participants agreed on a Declaration of Intent
which formalized their commitment and identified five common work areas: (i) social inclusion,
(ii) implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals, (iii) empowerment of vulnerable
populations, (iv) generation of economic opportunities, and (v) education. It was decided that
their collaboration should concentrate at first on the first two areas, to which end each
organization would perform a mapping exercise of their respective work in those two areas. In
keeping with the group's objectives, another teleconference or meeting was scheduled for April
2017.

Model General Assembly of the OAS (MOAS)

In 2016, the Model OAS General Assembly Program for students of the Hemisphere (MOAS)
organized the following four MOAS with the participation of 1,080 students and 126 teachers
from OAS member states:

   The hemispheric model for universities: the Washington, D.C. MOAS for universities
    (WMOAS) from March 21 to 25, organized by the Institute for Diplomatic Dialogue in the
    Americas (IDDA) and sponsored by the GS/OAS.
   Model sessions for high schools: The thirty-fifth MOAS held at the headquarters of the
    GS/OAS from November 30 to December 2, and the sixth MOAS for Students of the
    Colombian Caribbean Region, held at the Universidad del Norte in Barranquilla from
    September 21 to 23.
   One Permanent Council Model for OAS interns (MOAS/PC) was organized jointly with the
    Department of Human Resources of the GS/OAS.

Achievements in 2016

   Greater internationalization of the high schools model assembly: the thirty-fifth MOAS saw
    the highest level of international participation by the region’s schools since the program’s
    inception. Of the 22 schools that took part, 10 were from Costa Rica, Trinidad and Tobago,
    Belize, Colombia, Ecuador, El Salvador, and Peru. Furthermore, the sixth Model held at
    Universidad del Norte featured, for the first time, two delegations from international
    universities, comprising 10 students from ESAN University in Peru and the American
    University in Nicaragua.
   The thirty-fifth MOAS was attended by 122 international students, which surpassed the
    figure for the previous year’s Model.
   New audiovisual materials and program dissemination tools were created, while social
    media helped to boost the online presence of the MOAS.

2.2.2 Department of Conferences and Meetings Management

The Department of Conferences and Meetings Management (DCMM) oversaw the holding of 47
meetings of the Permanent Council as well as other events related to the Organization’s four
pillars.

With the cooperation of other areas of the Organization, it implemented best practices with
respect to the preparation and proceedings of the General Assembly.

The DCMM provided assistance to the host countries and offered services for holding four
ministerial meetings in 2016:

   Third Meeting of Ministers and High Authorities of Social Development within the
    Framework of CIDI (Paraguay)
   Tenth Regular Meeting of the Inter-American Committee on Ports (Uruguay)
   Sixtieth Regular Session of the Inter-American Drug Abuse Control Commission (Bahamas)
   Seventh Inter-American Meeting of Ministers of Culture and Highest Appropriate Authorities
    within the Framework of CIDI (Paraguay)

In 2016, the DCMM produced the Organizational and Operations Handbook for Meetings and
Conferences, the purpose of which is to boost efficiency in the organization of meetings both at
and away from headquarters.

In a bid to raise the quality of the services that it provides, the DCMM introduced a new
meetings control form and a user satisfaction survey.

The Documents Section coordinated with the Department of Press and Communication to
bolster the institutional image of the OAS through standardization of printed documents and
image unification.

It also broadened its portfolio of services to different areas of the General Secretariat, including
the graphic design, layout, and production of some 16,108 copies of publications and other
printed materials.

The Language Section provided simultaneous interpretation services in English, Spanish, French,
and Portuguese for the meetings of organs, agencies, and entities of the Organization. In all, it
translated approximately 6.6 million words into the four official languages of the Organization.

It also published the OAS Spanish and English style guides.

The roster of external translators who provide freelance services to the OAS was expanded.

To ensure efficient use of resources, the section’s personnel received training in the use of the
SDL Trados translation software.

2.2.3 Coordinating Office for the Offices and Units of the General Secretariat in the Member
      States (OGSMS)

In 2016, the Coordinating Office for the Offices and Units of the General Secretariat in the
Member States (OGSMS) provided advisory services on the operations of the offices of the
General Secretariat in the member states, including strategic guidance, coordination,
cooperation, and effective financial management services for activities in member states, and


                                              14
-----------------------Page 17 End-----------------------

formulating recommendations for optimizing efficiency and advice to the Permanent Council on
the OGSMS.

In keeping with efforts to reduce the impact of the budget cuts and optimize the role of the
OGSMS and in accordance with Executive Order 16-06, attempts were made to enhance
collaboration in order to boost efficiency and take advantage of the institutional presence in
member states. Continuous training for staff and equipment and technology improvements
have led to a significant labor productivity boost and greater efficiency in the use of available
resources.

The following results reflect the achievements made:
 Implementation of the Comprehensive Strategy for the OGSMS, the results of broad
   consultations with OAS representatives and secretariats, based on the Secretary General's
   Executive Order 16-06.
 Application of the guidelines contained in Executive Order 16-06, including formalization of
   focal points in each Secretariat as key contacts for coordination, interaction, and planning
   with the Coordinating Office.
 Continuous training for personnel in the use of financial tools. With the improvements in the
   NOCS, this has allowed the publication of budget and financial data, records and inventory
   monitoring, and easy access to useful information, resulting in savings of time and
   messenger service costs.
 Improvement of equipment, technology and communication systems in the OGSMS.
 Training in information sourcing, analysis, and management for OGSMS representatives.
   The event, held with financing provided by the European Union, included sessions on the
   role of the OAS in addressing border conflicts in the Hemisphere and in the response to
   natural hazards and new security threats.
 Ongoing collaboration with the Political Analysis System (SAPEM) of the Secretariat for
   Strengthening Democracy in order to ensure quality reporting to representatives.
 The country office in Honduras played a key role in helping to set up the Mission to Support
   the Fight against Corruption and Impunity in Honduras (MACCIH), whose objective is to
   improve the quality of services provided to the judicial system. In coordination with the
   Secretariat for strengthening democracy, it provided technical assistance for the Mission's
   presentation to the Honduran Government and local media.
 Country offices are systematically updated about the work of the OAS secretariats at online
   meetings and they focus on maximizing channels of assistance to other areas of the General
   Secretariat.
 Collaboration in gathering information to be shared on the OAS website regarding the
   contributions that the Organization makes through its activities, programs, and projects in
   each member state.
 Drafting of the Procedures Manual for Country Offices.

2.3      SECRETARIAT FOR STRENGTHENING DEMOCRACY

I. PRINCIPAL ACHIEVEMENTS

The achievements of the Secretariat for Strengthening Democracy in 2016 were as follows:

1. The deployment of nine electoral observation missions in eight countries in the region,
   involving a total of 547 observers (45 percent of them women): Bolivia, Colombia, Costa
   Rica, United States (for the first time), Jamaica, Haiti, Dominican Republic, and Peru. It also
   dispatched compliment missions to Mexico and Grenada. The missions analyzed areas such
   as electoral organization, use of technology, campaign finance, female participation, the
   system of electoral justice, the role of the media, aspects of exercises in direct democracy,
   Afro-descendant and indigenous participation, and voting by overseas citizens.

2. In the area of technical cooperation on electoral matters, of particular note were the
   activities of the project Quality Management Systems – ISO/TS 17582 and the update of
   the website www.oas-ieab.org.

3. Assistance to countries—that have so requested—in the strengthening and preservation of
   democratic institutions and peaceful conflict resolution. Particularly significant in this
   connection were the installation of the Mission to Support the Fight against Corruption and
   Impunity in Honduras (MACCIH) and the deployment of the Special Mission to Haiti to assess
   the situation prompted by the postponement of the elections. In addition, steps were taken
   to strengthen the work of the Mission to Support the Peace Process in Colombia
   (MAPP/OAS) and the implementation of confidence- and security-building measures
   between Belize and Guatemala.

4. Strengthening of cooperation on democracy and peace with other international and
   regional organizations, such as the United Nations and European Union. Also important
   were the activities to commemorate the fifteenth anniversary of the Inter-American
   Democratic Charter; work with the legislative branches of member states, integration
   parliaments, and parliamentary forums such as the Central American Parliament, Andean
   Parliament, Latin American parliaments, ParlAmericas, and EUROLAT; and the
   implementation of an institutional strengthening and experience-sharing program with the

                                               16

2.4      EXECUTIVE SECRETARIAT FOR INTEGRAL DEVELOPMENT (SEDI)

SEDI aligned its activities with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its Sustainable
Development Goals (SDG). In June 2016, the General Assembly adopted the Inter-American
Program for Sustainable Development (PIDS) 2016-2021, the Inter-American Meeting of
Ministers of Culture adopted the Declaration of Asunción in order to improve the circulation of
cultural goods and services in the Americas, and port officials established cooperation priorities
for the 2016–2018 period.

SEDI helped to strengthen regional competitiveness and innovation through the Inter-American
Competitiveness Network (RIAC). It fostered regional cooperation in the areas of innovation,
entrepreneurship, and competitiveness. More than 100 government decision makers,
representatives of the private sector, and academics from 27 countries took part in two
meetings of the Americas Competitiveness Exchange (ACE) on Innovation and
Entrepreneurship—one in the United States and the other in Canada. In addition, visits to more
than 45 companies, think tanks, and universities led to more than 30 concrete collaboration
activities.

SEDI continued to support the efforts of States to improve access to quality education. The
scholarship and training programs awarded more than 3,000 academic scholarships for
undergraduate, postgraduate, and professional development courses, in addition to providing
training to more than 40,000 people via the Educational Portal of the Americas and the Inter-
American Teacher Education Network. In relation to ports, the number of grants tripled
between 2013 and 2016 from 43 to 145. At the same time, the Partnerships Program for
Education and Training (PAEC) continue to expand.

The Inter-American Network for Labor Administration (RIAL) continued to deepen cooperation
between the region’s labor ministries, especially with regard to youth employment strategies.

On environmental matters, SEDI assisted states with the design and implementation of policies
aimed at integrating environmental priorities. It also rendered assistance in the implementation
of projects that include multiple countries in such areas as Integrated Water Resources
Management, Energy and Climate Change Mitigation; Risk Management and Climate Change
Adaptation, Biodiversity and Sustainable Land Management; and Environmental Law, Policy,
and Governance.

2.6    SECRETARIAT FOR ADMINISTRATION AND FINANCE (SAF)

The SAF comprises the: Department of Human Resources; Department of Financial Services;
Department of Information and Technology Services; Department of Procurement Services; and
Department of General Services. The SAF provides all of the areas with leadership, direction,
and guidance on administrative support activities, while directly carrying out the administrative
functions critical to the General Secretariat.

Office of the Secretary
The Office of the Secretary for Administration and Finance continued to support the
Organization's policy-making bodies, mainly the Committee on Administrative and Budgetary
Affairs (CAAP), serving as the primary link between the CAAP and General Secretariat. The Office

                                               40
-----------------------Page 43 End-----------------------

of the Secretary coordinated with all areas of the General Secretariat to support their programs
from an administrative standpoint, as the OAS prepared for the 13.5% budget cut that took
effect in 2017.

Accomplishments include:
   • An improved, albeit still difficult, financial situation because of careful management of
     spending and revenue, leading to:
     - The General Secretariat cutting spending and executing $3.1 million below the
          approved budget.
        - The General Secretariat complying with the Permanent Council’s instructions by
            taking advantage of additional spending cuts to return $740,000 to the Capital
            Scholarship Fund for 2017.
        - The General Secretariat undertaking a voluntary separation process to facilitate the
            departure of staff and reduce mandatory spending, thereby reducing 2017
            expenditure.
   • A favorable audit report received from the external auditors. This is critical to building
     donor confidence about OAS capacity to properly manage Specific Fund donations for
     OAS projects.
   • Continued prudent investment policies to obtain strong returns on investment in the
     OAS Retirement and Pension Fund and in the Medical Benefits Trust Fund.
   • The General Secretariat was able to undertake several critical projects, despite the lack
     of adequate financing, which remains a challenge to maintaining OAS infrastructure and
     real estate assets. Obsolete Permanent Council equipment was replaced.
   • SAF adjusted the work load and tasks in order to compensate for the ongoing loss of
     personnel.

2.6.1 Department of Human Resources (DHR)

The Department of Human Resources (DHR) pursued activities focused on improving quality of
life for staff and deepening a sense of belonging to the Organization.

Activities to contribute to staff wellbeing:

    OAS mental and hearing health benefits were improved in real terms, through the
     GS/OAS Self-Insured Health Care Plan.
    Six (6) seminars were held, covering prevention issues in physical and mental health. The
     “Annual Health Fair” was held. More than 300 participants attended. Altogether, more
     than 1,075 participants attended these activities.
    The Alternative Work Schemes Policy was implemented, affording employees greater
     flexibility in their working hours.
    The "Staff Awards and Recognition Ceremony" and the "End of Year Celebration with the
     Secretary General" were held.



                                               41
-----------------------Page 44 End-----------------------

Competition processes:

    The statutory competition processes that had been suspended for several months were
     resumed and 43 competitions were announced over a 6-week period, to regularize the
     contract status of more than 50 members of staff.
    Competitions to fill vacancies in the General Secretariat were resumed, allowing for new
     staff to be taken in.
    The competition process defined in article 121 of the General Standards for the hiring of
     the Inspector General was started.

Internship program:

    A total of 2,659 applications were received for the three internship sessions in 2016.
    A total of 243 interns took part in the 2016 sessions.

Voluntary separations:

    Incentive packages were designed for staff wishing to pursue a voluntary separation. DHR
     provided support for 26 members of staff who took advantage of the initiative.

New salary and benefits structure implemented:

    The new United Nations-approved salary scale for professionals was implemented. A
     special Section was created on the Intranet site, each staff member was sent a sample
     salary receipt under the new salary structure, and those who had questions for the
     Department were given personalized attention. This meant implementation was totally
     error-free and clear for affected staff members.

Mandates:

    Clause III.A.11.a of General Assembly resolution AG/RES. 2 (LI-E/16) rev.1
    Clause III.A.8.b of General Assembly resolution AG/RES. 2 (LI-E/16) rev.1

2.6.2 Department of Financial Services (DFS)

The Department of Financial Services (DFS) cut its staff by more than 45% over the last few
years.

Accomplishments include:
    Completion of all external audits of projects financed with specific funds for 2016;
     regular maintenance of accountability of all funds of the Organization, through the OAS
     website
    The indirect cost recovery (ICR) policy being updated, raising the percentage to 13%
    Training for the administrative sections on preliminary financial statement preparation
     and how to use information stored on a shared drive on the network
    Purging the Specific Funds of more than 250 expired projects
    Implementation of electronic payment of federal tax reimbursements.
    Electronic form OAS 329 implemented
    Start of automation of transfers via the OASES platform

Despite these accomplishments, DFS lacks added capacity to reassign functions for frozen
positions, and is operating at maximum capacity.

Financial outcomes of the main funds administered by the General Secretariat*

Regular Fund:

      The special General Assembly session in October adopted the program-budget for 2017,
       for $84,975,442 with an execution ceiling of $73,500,100, which is lower than the
       approved execution level of $84,324,100 for fiscal 2016. In order to finance it, a net
       allocation of quotas for $84,525,442 and other income of $450,000 was established.
      At the end of fiscal 2016, the General Secretariat executed $81.2 million, equivalent to
       96.3% of the approved budget.
      As of December 31, 2016, there was a zero cash balance.

Specific Funds:

      Contributions to the Specific Funds totaled $45.7 million in 2016.
      The three largest contributors in 2016 were USA, with $16.9 million, equivalent to
       36.9%; followed by Canada, with $4.2 million; and the European Union, with $3.8
       million.
      Compared to 2015, the member states increased their contributions by 1.2%. By
       contrast, permanent observers saw a 20.6% reduction, while contributions from other
       donors fell 28.6%.
      In 2016, Specific Funds expenditure totaled $54.1 million. Of that amount, 25.6% were
       for projects under Chapter 6 - Secretariat for Strengthening Democracy; followed by

                                               44
-----------------------Page 47 End-----------------------

        24.8%, under Chapter 8 - Secretariat for Multidimensional Security; and 16.9% under
        Chapter 7 - Executive Secretariat for Integral Development.
       Likewise, the $54.1 million in expenditure was mostly: $20.4 million, or 37.7% on
        performance contract; $9.6 million, or 17.7% on travel; and $9.1 million, or 16.8%, on
        personnel expenses.

Indirect cost Recovery Fund (ICRF):

       Revenue totaled $6.3 million compared to 2015, which saw $4.5 million. This represents
        a substantial increase of 40%.
       Although the ICRF budget for 2016 was set at $4.5 million, budget execution was less:
        $4.2 million.
       The ICRF Reserve Fund ended with a positive balance of $2.4 million.

* Preliminary, unaudited figures.

2.6.3 Department of Information and Technology Services (DOITS)

The Department of Information and Technology Services stepped up its efforts to keep the
Organization’s information service infrastructure operational.

Goals fulfilled:

Technology infrastructure:

       Increase in storage of information generated, with a year-on-year increase of 11%.
       Consolidation of the virtual infrastructure of servers moved forward (reducing the
        carbon footprint generated).
       There was a confirmed increase in demand for wireless communications for mobile
        devices.
       Help Desk activity remained at previous levels (8,000 tickets received).
       The studies to replace the obsolete data back-up system were started, the aim being to
        outsource back-up to some “cloud” service.
       Work started under the technology project to replace more than 160 obsolete
        workstations using the Windows XP operating system that posed an information security
        risk for the Organization.

The absence of a capital fund has prevented DOITS from making headway with the
recommendations that arose out of the OAS Modernization Project, which are vital to ensuring
that the Organization remains functional.




                                              45
-----------------------Page 48 End-----------------------

Information Technology Security:

      Activity designed to prevent and trigger alerts in the event of I.T. attacks was maintained
       at normal levels (some 100,000 incidents analyzed).

Application development:

Due to the constant reduction in its personnel and the shortage of available Regular Fund
financing, this Department has had to stretch its capacity to the utmost. Those budgetary
constraints prevented it from implementing new services and from complying with Board of
External Auditors recommendations, such as those on the need to update the Organization’s
internal management systems (OAS ERP).
     Even so, 6 new applications were put into operation, notably a new Expenses
        Authorization Request System (EARS).
     A software platform was engaged to start redefining OAS business processes (K2).

2.6.4 Department of Procurement Services (DPS)

Procurement management
    Collaborative ties with multilateral organizations (IDB, World Bank, IMF, OAS, PAHO, and
       UN) on issues of common interest and to increase our negotiating power. The 2016
       forum reaffirmed the concern about the OAS falling behind in several fields related to
       procurement, modernization, and best practices.
    Despite cutbacks in personnel, the volume of work performed remained more or less
       constant, with more than 33,000 transactions recorded, valued at more than US$86.5
       million.
    There were 9 formal bidding processes and 6 medium orders started. The contracts
       awarded yielded savings of some USS200,000.
    GS/OAS insurance portfolio was renegotiated without increasing costs, and with better
       coverage and less risk.

Travel management
    Savings in both costs and time were achieved through enforcement of official policies,
       continuous supervision, the use of reports, and constant expense reconciliation.
    We continued monitoring and recovered ticket costs that were previously lost (to the
       tune of some US$60,000).
    Efforts to automate and test travel-related purchase orders were started. The first phase
       is expected to be launched in 2017.

Supplier management
    There was an increase in the number of preferential rate agreements with suppliers.
       Particularly worth mentioning are the preferential rates and terms negotiated with hotel
       chains, suppliers of office products, and with the major airlines serving the Americas.
       The savings generated under this heading exceeded US$40,000.

                                               46
-----------------------Page 49 End-----------------------

      A special discount was obtained from the main supplier of computers to GS/OAS. The
       savings negotiated were more than 30% of the retail value. This approach produced
       more than US$50,000 in estimated savings this year.

Other
    Several tasks aimed at achieving improvements and efficiency/savings had to be
      postponed. Notable among them were: A legal review of the CPR system, expansion of
      the corporate credit card program, a review of procurement regulations, a review of
      policies and procedures, and so on.

2.6.5 Department of General Services (DGS)

In 2016, the goals proposed in the annual operational plan were achieved. They were geared
towards managing general services for the operation of the General Secretariat and
maintenance of its facilities. The accomplishments are reflected in the building maintenance, in
the Inventory Section, and in the Messenger, Mail, Transportation and Photocopy Section, with
continuous service. Rental of office space and event facilities also increased.

Building Management and Maintenance Section
     Maintenance projects were executed, including deferred projects that were considered
       critical, among them the GSB chillers, two air conditioning units in the MNB, and the GSB
       backup battery system (UPS). The drainage system in the MNB and ADM were also
       upgraded, and overflow valves were installed in the MNB, the Museum, and ADM.
     Energy-saving measures were put in place and led to a 565,993 kilowatt reduction in
       electricity consumption, equivalent to 7% savings.

Security Section
    Access control equipment (cards, ID readers) were updated and new recording
       equipment (CCTV) was installed, improving the security system of the buildings.
    Fire evacuation drills and alarm system tests were conducted for the MNB, ADM, and
       GSB facilities, and fire extinguishers were purchased.
    Training activities on safety and security measures were conducted for drivers of
       delegates from 16 permanent missions.

Messenger, Mail, and Transportation Section
   The operational activities of the unit were fulfilled.

2.9       SECRETARIAT FOR HEMISPHERIC AFFAIRS

The Secretariat for Hemispheric Affairs (SHA) spearheaded the intersectoral coordination of
strategic “hemispheric” initiatives through the Committee for Analysis of Strategic Initiatives
(CASIE). It developed the School of Governance as a cross-cutting initiative of the General
Secretariat. It has been at the forefront of OAS programs to support good governance in such
fields as open government, open data, public procurement, and improved identity registration
systems. It also restructured the Summits of the Americas Department in order to strengthen
OAS diplomatic capacity, and launched sustainability plans for the Columbus Memorial Library
(CML) and the Art Museum of the Americas (AMA).

Results obtained
    The departments and sections (DEPM, SAS, AMA, CML) have become more efficient, and
       a new capacity for crosscutting coordination in the General Secretariat was launched.
    Under the CASIE, four of the Secretary General's five strategic initiatives (School of
       Government, Natural Disaster Prevention, the Inter-American Education System, and
       interconnectivity in the Caribbean) have been corrected. Three of the five initiatives
       were also submitted to the member states.
    Support products and programs were better aligned with good governance, including
       technical support in open government at the request of the President of Guatemala and
       with European Union assistance in Haiti/Dominican Republic in identity registration.
    It provided technical secretariat services for the ministerial meetings of CLARCIEV (civil
       registry); the Cadastre Network; the Government Procurement Network (GPN); and the
       Network of E-Government Leaders (GEALC).

       After the departure of directors of the Columbus Memorial Library and the Art Museum
       of the Americas, both institutions were restructured.

      Benchmarks related to SHA work:
       - Promote transparent and effective public institutions, and support citizen
       - participation mechanisms
       - Strengthen policy dialogue through the Summits of the Americas process.
       - Promote a program coordination approach that reflects interdependence among the
          pillars of the Organization.

2.10   OFFICE OF THE STRATEGIC COUNSEL FOR ORGANIZATIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND
       MANAGEMENT FOR RESULTS (SCODMR)

The Office of the Strategic Counsel for Organizational Development and Management for
Results (SCODMR) promoted greater coordination within the General Secretariat, in order to
align the Organization with fulfillment of the policy guidelines from the member states. It
prepared documents that served as input for the Strategic Plan prepared and approved by the
member states at the General Assembly on October 31, 2016.

In coordination with the areas of the General Secretariat, it prepared a draft budget consistent
with the budget ceiling authorized and structured to start the transition, moving away from the
practice of an inertial budget to a budget that follows the policy guidelines and supports
implementation of the Strategic Plan.

It also crafted a fundraising strategy based on the Guidelines and Objectives of the Strategic
Plan. SCODMR activities focused as well on publicizing the OAS’ work and results achieved in the
member states by drawing up and implementing an internal and external communication
strategy.

The detailed results produced by the Office of the Strategic Counsel are presented under the
following areas of SCODMR.

2.10.1 Department of Planning and Evaluation

The Department of Planning and Evaluation (DPE) submitted a two-year program-budget in line
with the Strategic Plan of the Organization, for the first time establishing a relationship with the
programs, products, and services for the secretariats under the four basic pillars of the OAS.
Taking into account the mandate regarding execution with a $72.5 million ceiling, the
Department presented another program-budget adjusted to the aforementioned ceiling.
Simultaneously, it undertook a process to prepare the proposal for the 2016-2020 Four-Year
Strategic Plan of the Organization. The DPE also continued implementing program and project
management processes (design, monitoring, and evaluation) based on results in the General
Secretariat; and strengthening staff capacities in those areas.

The following results were obtained:

ORGANIZATIONAL DEVELOPMENT SECTION

The Organizational Development Section (ODS), together with the DPE, coordinated a joint
activity involving the various secretariats, culminating in the proposed strategic plan that the
Secretary General submitted to the Permanent Council in May 2016. To support
implementation of the 2017-2020 Strategic Plan, which was approved on October 31, 2016, the
Section prepared an Organizational Development Program.

Of particular note are the integrated programs that drive the transition from projects,
programs, and services produced separately, to them being grouped under coherent, cross-
pillar integrated programs guided by the Strategic Vision:

1) preparation of a skills database; 2) preparation and implementation of a Performance
Support Training Plan; 3) mapping and optimization of the main organizational processes; and
(4) establishment of a coordination mechanism to support the creation of integrated programs.

Results obtained in 2016:

  Organizational Development Program developed, and start of its implementation.
  Mechanism for better coordination among the different areas of the General Secretariat,
   through integrated programs, designed.
 Proposal for identification of the skills needed to implement the Strategic Plan and
   documentation of current skills.

2.10.2 Department of Press and Communications

The Department of Press and Communications continued to work towards fulfilling the purpose
set forth in the November 2015 Communications Strategy: “To get the OAS to be viewed by key
stakeholders (external and internal) as a facilitator of solutions in issues of democracy, human
rights, security, and integral development.” Thus, published articles that mentioned the OAS in
the region’s leading newspapers almost doubled (+96%, see details below). These included 9
opinion pieces in newspapers such as El País (of Spain), Miami Herald, Le Devoir, and The Globe
and Mail. Monitoring of the official social media accounts and their reach (or impressions) was
nearly doubled in both cases (+99% and +93%, respectively). In a year in which social networks
drew traffic away from traditional websites, the OAS website managed to maintain the levels of
the previous year. Video playback on Vimeo decreased slightly, perhaps due to video users
switching to Facebook and Twitter (comparative data not yet available). The rationalization of
email dispatches continued: the number of dispatches was cut by 51 percent (from 1,175 to
576 dispatches), but the opening ratio increased by 29 percent: less material is transmitted but
more public interest is generated.

Corporate communication management tasks (editing of speeches, preparation of interviews,
design and execution of communication plans) were strengthened. Efforts were launched - in
collaboration with the Department of Information Technology Services (DOITS) - to redesign the
website: outlines of the renewal plan, first draft of the home page, and selection of a content
management system.

Revamping and standardization of the General Secretariat’s image continued with the
publication and launch of a new handbook for the use of the institutional logo.

-   Media coverage: Compared to 2015, mentions of the OAS in
      o The New York Times increased 75 percent (from 20 to 35)

      o The Miami Herald, 120 percent (from 39 to 86)
      o La Nación (Argentina), 145 percent (from 110 to 270)
      o El Universal (Mexico), 43 percent (from 140 to 200)
      o El País (Spain), 51 percent (from 99 to 150)

-   Website:
      o The number of unique visitors increased 2.69 per cent.

2.10.3 Department of External Relations/International Affairs (DIA)

In 2016, the Department of External Relations/International Affairs began efforts to produce a
new fundraising strategy, with all the secretariats of the Organization participating and
committed to addressing the downward trend in the specific funds and to strengthen the
mobilization of financial contributions to the Organization from donors. In addition, mutual
cooperation was promoted with the 72 observer countries. The Strategy includes:

    I. Giving new impetus to fundraising from donors.

Resolution AG/RES. 2889 (XLVI-O/16) instructs the Secretary General to ensure greater efforts
to mobilize external resources for implementing the mandates of the General Assembly and to
maintain transparency and accountability in using and reporting on those funds in the semi-
annual reports on those resources/funds. External factors, including a substantial cut in
development aid for Latin America and the Caribbean, have influenced the downward trend in
the specific funds of the Organization, especially over the last 10 years[1].

In 2016, it embarked on consultations within the General Secretariat, seeking to align,
harmonize, and strengthen fundraising processes to help fund the Organization's programs and
activities, focusing on the need to find new donors. As a result of the consultations, it received
input for aligning and coordinating a Resource Mobilization Strategy based on the Guidelines
and Objectives set forth in the Strategic Plan and taking into account the need for adequate,
stable, and enhanced funding. To that end, a portfolio of fundraising programs was established,
in coordination with the Secretariats of the Organization.

    II. To promote mutual cooperation with the 72 strategic permanent observers, the
        Department:
         Facilitated active participation and collaboration from permanent observers around
           programs under the Organization’s key areas of impact.
         Promoted mutual cooperation with the 72 strategic permanent observers, including
           financial support for GS/OAS programs.
         Organized two sessions with the permanent observers in the aftermath of the
           earthquake in Ecuador and in the wake of the damage caused by Hurricane Matthew
           in Haiti, resulting in the mobilization of financial and logistical support for those
           countries.
         Promoted GS/OAS and IACHR priority programs during the Dialogue that the
           Secretary General and the member states’ ministers of foreign affairs held with the
           permanent observers during the General Assembly in the Dominican Republic.
           European foreign ministers, as well as directors for the Americas and 35 of the

development assistance (ODA) in 1960 to 7.6% for the current decade.

           observer countries’ ambassadors to the White House, took part in this dialogue, in
           which the Secretary General and Secretaries for the different areas exchanged ideas
           on opportunities for cooperation and accountability concerning the implementation
           of projects.
          Managed observer country funding for highly important GS/OAS programs, in
           particular financial support for: the MAPP, EOMs (Haiti and the United States,
           Colombia's Peace Plebiscite), IACHR, and the Office of the Special Rapporteur for
           Freedom of Expression, Mission to Support the Fight against Corruption and
           Impunity in Honduras (MACCIH), and multidimensional security programs.
          Managed the entry of two permanent observers into the OAS: Bangladesh and
           Moldavia.
          Mobilized contributions from permanent observers, to the tune of US$13,892,756
           from January 1 through December 31, 2016.

3.        AUTONOMOUS ENTITIES AND AGENCIES

3.1       INTER-AMERICAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS

A conventional body, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights was formally established on
September 3, 1979, as a result of the American Convention on Human Rights entering into force
on July 18, 1978.

It is an "autonomous judicial institution," whose purpose is to apply and interpret the American
Convention. Headquartered in San José, Costa Rica, it is composed of seven judges who are
nationals of member states of the Organization of American States.

In 2016, the Court comprised: Roberto F. Caldas (Brazil), President; Eduardo Ferrer Mac-Gregor
Poisot (Mexico), Vice President; Eduardo Vio Grossi (Chile); Humberto A. Sierra Porto
(Colombia); Elizabeth Odio Benito (Costa Rica); Raúl Zaffaroni (Argentina); and Patricio Pazmiño
(Ecuador). The judges are assisted in their functions by the Secretariat to the Court. The
Secretary of the Court is Pablo Saavedra Alessandri (Chile) and the Deputy Secretary is Emilia
Segares Rodríguez (Costa Rica).

     Principal Activities and Achievements in 2016

         The Court held five sessions at its San José, Costa Rica, headquarters and two sessions
          away from headquarters – in Mexico City, Mexico, and in Quito, Ecuador.


                                                74
-----------------------Page 77 End-----------------------

         There were 16 public hearings on contentious cases and one evidentiary hearing during
          proceedings on contentious cases, which took place in Brazil.
         One evidentiary hearing was held for the first time, consisting of a visit to a prison facility
          in Brazil to observe how provisional measures are implemented.
         It held seven public hearings during proceedings for monitoring compliance with
          judgments.
         The Court issued twenty one judgments: 14 on merits in contentious cases and six
          judgments on interpretation.
         The Court issued one advisory opinion and 25 compliance monitoring resolutions of
          judgment.
         The Court issued 13 resolutions on provisional measures.
         Currently it has 22 active provisional measures.
         The Inter-American Commission submitted 16 new contentious cases to the Inter-
          American Court.
         As at the end of 2016, the Court had 27 contentious cases pending settlement and three
          advisory opinions.

     Relations and cooperation pursued with other inter-American and international agencies
      to carry out activities

In 2016, the Court was in close communication with the OAS General Secretariat regarding
administrative and financial matters, and always had its support and collaboration for the
Court’s activities. The Secretary General took part in the opening ceremony for the 2016 judicial
year; and on August 29 the full membership of both the Inter-American Court of Human Rights
and the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) met with the OAS Secretary
General in Mexico City. The Court and the IACHR set up a joint working group to find structural
solutions to the financial situation, and on September 30 submitted a joint proposal to the OAS
Secretary General.

The Court operates an internship and professional tours program. In 2016 alone it hosted 69 of
these, from 19 different countries. The Court also organized 12 courses and seminars at various
locations across the region, in an effort to broaden understanding of the Court’s jurisprudence,
mandate, and powers and to raise awareness about the inter-American human rights protection
system.

3.2       INTER-AMERICAN COMMISSION ON HUMAN RIGHTS (IACHR)

1.        PRINCIPAL ACHIEVEMENTS

Among the main achievements of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) in
2016 was the establishment of the “Special Follow-Up Mechanism for the Ayotzinapa
Investigation,” in implementation of precautionary measure resolution 42/16, of July 29, 2016.
The Mechanism is being implemented through official and technical visits, in keeping with the

                                                    75
-----------------------Page 78 End-----------------------

published work plan. The Commission also worked on the implementation of precautionary
measures to safeguard the life and personal integrity of human rights defenders, indigenous
leaders, and labor union members. It also put into effect measures for reducing its procedural
backlog in accordance with IACHR resolution 1/16, to which some States objected, on the
grounds that it would impair their ability to mount a timely defense. Also of note is the progress
made in defining and enhancing standards on the rights of persons living with HIV, informed
decision-making with regard to health, preventing and ending violence against women, and the
exercise of political and reproductive rights. Other achievements are the consolidation of case
law promoted by the IACHR in the area of grave human rights violations, such as forced
disappearances, extrajudicial executions, and torture, in contexts such as armed conflict and the
fight against drug trafficking and organized crime. As regards progress in compliance with
IACHR recommendations and friendly settlement agreements, it is of note that of the 207
monitored cases included in the Annual Report of the IACHR of 2016, in 48, the member state
concerned had fully implemented the recommendations, and in 126, the recommendations had
been implemented in part. Another achievement is the presentation and dissemination of six
thematic reports on standards and recommendations on the rights of LGTBI persons, migrants,
women, children and adolescents, Afro-descendants, and indigenous peoples. Lastly, of note is
the scope of the dissemination campaigns on situations of human rights in the region conducted
by the IACHR through social media, which, in 2016, reached 83 million people.

2.   PRINCIPAL RESULTS
Among the principal results of the IACHR, the following are of note:
    At its four sessions, in Washington, D.C., Santiago, Chile, and Panama, and by
     videoconference, the IACHR adopted: 16 merit reports; eight friendly settlement
     reports; 43 admissibility reports; two inadmissibility reports, and five merit reports for
     publication.
    The IACHR granted and held 96 public hearings and 66 working meetings with States and
     civil society.
    In the exercise of its authorities, the IACHR referred 16 cases to the Inter-American Court
     of Human Rights in which the following main rights were affected: life, personal liberty,
     personal integrity, access to justice, equality, and non-discrimination, among others.
     The Commission also participated in hearings of the Court during eight of its sessions.
    Activities were carried out to publish and promote the five thematic reports adopted in
     2015, on indigenous peoples, Afro-descendent communities and extractive industries;

were promoted by means of the 2030 ICT Alliance for the Americas to improve the quality of
education in the Americas and develop talents for the new digital economy.

2.     Information demonstrating results
 A new value of the associate member contributory unit and the 2017 plan of operations
   were adopted to strengthen the 2014-2018 strategic plan of CITEL. Demonstrating the
   interest in the strengthening and growth of CITEL, an ad hoc working group was formed to
   identify opportunities to increase associate member participation.
 Thirty-three inter-American proposals were introduced at the World Telecommunication
   Standardization Assembly (WTSA-16) to assist governments, the private sector, and
   academic institutions in fulfilling their objectives for 2020 in connection with fifth generation
   networks, artificial intelligence, smart cars, and other ICT areas in the framework of the
   United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Also promoted were training sessions on
   mobile device theft and regulatory practices to combat fraud in subscriber satellite
   television reception, benefiting 20 member states.
 The Inter-American Convention on the International Amateur Radio Permit (IARP) was
   updated. Under this Convention, an alternative platform can be generated when other
   communications services are inoperable. Also adopted were recommendations on
   frequency allocations for public protection and disaster relief and on authorizing orbiting
   stations to communicate with geostationary space stations in the fixed satellite service in
   specific frequency bands in the Americas. The 2030 ICT Alliance for the Americas was
   launched with the telecommunications/ICT industry. Implementation began of a
   memorandum of understanding between the OAS and Telefónica Educación Digital to make
   available to citizens of the Americas digital education products with social impact; as was
   another memorandum with Profuturo for the provision of digital classrooms with mobile
   devices, training, and high quality content to improve education in vulnerable areas of Latin
   America and the Caribbean. This was the framework for the launch of the Stem4Good
   Américas competition.
 Further implementation of ICT initiatives with the Inter-American Commission of Women
   (CIM), which include mainstreaming gender on CITEL’s global agenda. At the same time, the
   competition “ICTs to prevent and eradicate violence against women” was launched. Forty-
   five proposals for using ICTs as a tool for women’s empowerment were received.

In 2016, the OIG conducted and completed seven audits. Thus far, 24 recommendations have
been issued. The OIG concentrated on operations with a high degree of risk and those with
most potential to improve performance and use of resources in the General Secretariat.

The operational audits and its reviews and evaluations covered: the Regular Fund transition
costs; the specific fund disbursement process; reports and data transparency; the offices of the
General Secretariat in Peru and Bolivia; administration and use of travel miles; and travel by
non-OAS employees.

Investigations
The OIG has a direct hotline by which alleged fraud and any other type of misconduct may be
reported. In 2016, six matters were reported to the OIG for investigation. Two referred to
reports of workplace harassment, one to abuse, one to contract fraud, one to misconduct, and
one to the criminal history of a General Secretariat employee. The OIG continued four
investigations that were pending or at the preliminary review stage.

The OIG closed three matters after completing full investigations. It also closed another two
investigations that were pending or at the preliminary review stage.

In consequence, the OIG issued five recommendations in two cases: four regarding a case of
workplace harassment and one that referred to reports of misconduct.

The OIG dealt with two special assignments: evaluation of the Virtual Educa program and fraud
monitoring in the health care program.

Other activities
The Office continued to advise and assist the General Secretariat through analyses, risk
assessments, verifications, investigations, and recommendations. It also participated as an
observer in a number of General Secretariat committee meetings and presented reports to
various established bodies.

3.8    OFFICE OF THE OMBUDSPERSON (OMB)

The Office of the Ombudsperson (OMB) was created by the current administration in response
to member state concerns and as an indication of General Secretariat commitment to promote
a respectful work environment that emphasized equity and more rights for more people.

The addition of an informal intake point for dispute resolution, separate from existing formal
processes, helped create a framework for more timely resolution. OMB assistance was sought
owing to a desire for confidentiality, providing an approach to the resolution of workplace
disputes.

In under a year, the OMB began full operation as an alternative dispute resolution mechanism,
working directly with staff members and non-official personnel.

The OMB held an informational meeting to raise staff member awareness and a series of
interactive dialogues for staff member education and confidence-building.

Those efforts met with a positive response from OAS staff members and non-official personnel.
Fifty-nine percent of those who sought OMB services occupied professional level posts, 23%
were consultants, 10% occupied General Services posts, and 9% belonged to other categories
(interns, scholarship holders, volunteers).

Eighty cases, representing on average two separate areas of concern, were handled through the
OMB. Most cases were resolved satisfactorily through this alternative dispute resolution
process and did not proceed to formal procedures, resulting in significant cost savings for the
Organization.

The development of a comprehensive case management system created an analytical
framework with objective reference points for General Secretariat use to measure progress in
specific areas.

A cooperation network was created with the United Nations, World Bank, PAHO, IDB, and U.S.
Department of State, among others, improved operating practices and advisory support for the
OMB, without cost to the Organization.

Another positive result of the OMB was the emergence, at staff member initiative, of a
departure interview process within the Secretariat. Upon separation from the organization
(whether or not voluntarily), individuals have begun to visit the Office, providing information
useful for future selection, promotion, and retention activities.

3.9    BOARD OF EXTERNAL AUDITORS

Pursuant to General Assembly resolution AG/RES. 123 (III-O/73), adopted in April 1973, and
Permanent Council resolution CP/RES. 124 (164/75) of June 1975, the Board of External Auditors
is responsible for the external auditing of the accounts of the General Secretariat of the
Organization of American States (GS/OAS).

The Board held its annual meeting from April 18 to 22, 2016, to prepare its report on the
external audit of the accounts and financial statements of the General Secretariat for the years
ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.

On May 18, 2016, the Board submitted its observations (OEA/Ser.S, JAE/doc.46/16, dated May
9, 2016) to the Permanent Council. The report has four sections: (a) Report of the Board of
External Auditors; (b) Financial Statements of the OAS; (c) Financial Statements of Agencies and
Entities related to the OAS; and (d) OAS Retirement and Pension Fund.

Based on the unqualified opinions issued by Ernst & Young, LLP, the financial statements of the
audited entities tally with the books, documents, and supporting evidence of the General
Secretariat.

Recommendations:
    That the OAS adopt the draft resolution “Measures to Encourage Prompt Payment of
     Quotas and Increase Liquidity.”
    That the General Assembly adopt the Strategic Plan and budget for 2017 as soon as
     possible in order to allow the OAS sufficient time to take the necessary steps for
     operation at a reduced level as of January 2, 2017.
    That once the budget for 2017 has been approved, the OAS ensure that future budgets
     incorporate the operating deficiencies that have been identified, such as deferred real
     estate maintenance and information technology infrastructure needs.
    That the OAS approve and implement the real estate and fixed asset maintenance
     strategy.
    That the member states fund a sustainable corporate enterprise system.

The Board highlighted the fact that in the case of the following 2015 financial statements, the
firm of independent auditors Ernst & Young, LLC had issued unqualified or “clean” opinions,
which is the best possible outcome of an audit:
     Regular Fund, Development Cooperation Fund, Specific and Service Funds of the OAS
     Leo S. Rowe Pan American Fund and Rowe Memorial Benefit Fund
     Trust for the Americas
     Medical Benefits Trust Fund
     Inter-American Defense Board
     Retirement and Pension Fund

4.     SPECIALIZED ENTITIES AND ORGANIZATIONS

4.1    INTER-AMERICAN DEFENSE BOARD (IADB)

BACKGROUND

The Inter-American Defense Board (IADB) is an independent international organization founded
on March 30, 1942. In 2006, the General Assembly of the Organization of American States (OAS)
established the IADB as an “entity” of the Organization and adopted its Statutes. The IADB
currently has 28 member states and seven observer states, and its structure comprises the
Council of Delegates, the Secretariat, and the Inter-American Defense College (IADC). Its
purpose is to provide the OAS and its member states with technical advice on matters related to
military and defense issues in the Hemisphere.

ACTIVITIES

In 2016, the IADB was strengthened as a facilitator in different forums of the Hemisphere that
address military and defense matters. It participated in the XII Conference of the Defense
Ministers of the Americas, providing support as the historical memory, and in the development
of the conference’s thematic areas. The IADB continued its actions in Colombia in support of
the Program for Comprehensive Action against Antipersonnel Mines (AICMA) of the Secretariat
for Multidimensional Security (SSM). Ties were strengthened with the Inter-American
Committee on Natural Disaster Reduction (IACNDR) for natural disaster monitoring,
satisfactorily monitoring assistance provided in connection with the Ecuador earthquake. To
disseminate experiences and lessons learned, two seminars were organized: on natural
disasters and on humanitarian demining. In the area of education, the Master of Science in
Inter-American Defense and Security, imparted at the Inter-American Defense College, was
strengthened, with 62 Master’s degrees awarded to candidates from 13 countries of the
Hemisphere.

The activities of the IADB were:

 Ties with organizations at the hemispheric, regional, subregional, and service level;
   The Conference of American Armies (CAA), the Inter-American Naval Conference (CNI),
     the Conference of American Air Force Chiefs (CONJEFAMER), the Conference of Central
     American Armed Forces (CFAC), the South American Defense Conference (SOUTHDEC),
     the Central American Security Conference (CENTSEC), and the Caribbean Nations Security
     Conference (CANSEC);
   The Regional Security System (RSS), CARICOM Implementation Agency for Crime and
     Security (CARICOM IMPACS), and Inter-American Committee against Terrorism forums;




                                              90
-----------------------Page 93 End-----------------------

       Humanitarian demining:
       Participation with Colombia in the Colombia Monitoring Mission Group (GMI-CO); the
        OAS authorized one additional monitor from Mexico, benefiting monitoring tasks;
       Contributed to the development of four courses on monitoring and leadership and
        provided instructors in this area through the Inter-American Technical Advisory Group in
        Colombia (GATI-CO);
       Participation in the 19th Annual Meeting of National Mine Action Programme Directors
        and United Nations Advisors, in Geneva;
       Ten representatives sent to the demining and munitions deactivation course, offered by
        the Kingdom of Spain;
       Seminar on humanitarian demining at the Casa del Soldado;

 XII Conference of the Defense Ministers of the Americas (CMDA), in Trinidad and Tobago;
  The rules of procedure of the CMDA were amended to include the IADB as responsible for
  preparing its historical memory.

       Natural disasters:
       Collaboration with the IACNDR for analysis of information on the Ecuador earthquake
       Tracking and monitoring of Hurricane Matthew, which struck Haiti. That information
        was disseminated to the Permanent Council;
       Seminar on natural disasters, in coordination with the OAS;

 Confidence- and security-building measures in the Americas:
   Collaboration with the OAS to prepare the new Consolidated List of Confidence- and
     Security Building Measures (CSBMs);
   Participation in the development of the seventh meeting of the Forum on CSBMs;

       New threats and other military and defense aspects:
       Participation in different events that discussed issues of public security, organized crime,
        cybersecurity, terrorism, public health issues (such as the Zika virus), and human rights.

 Education:
  The Inter-American Defense College completed its second year as a Master’s degree
  awarding institution. Academic freedom is an imperative of the university. The IADC’s basic
  courses include international relations and the inter-American system; strategic thinking for
  hemispheric defense and security; political economy of defense and security;
  multidimensional security in the Americas; hemispheric defense and security policy; and
  dispute analysis and resolution. Lastly, the College began exploratory efforts in additional
  areas of current interest, including cybersecurity and gender mainstreaming.

4.2      INTER-AMERICAN INSTITUTE FOR COOPERATION ON AGRICULTURE (IICA)

In 2016, the Inter-American Institute for Cooperation on Agriculture (IICA) deepened the
implementation of its results-based cooperation model by executing five hemispheric projects,
12 multinational projects, 31 rapid response actions, and coordinating 12 regional integration
mechanisms. This group of initiatives was supplemented by 209 externally-funded projects that
called for total expenditure of nearly US$110 million.

The main objectives of these projects and actions were to: (1) build capacities of public
institutions to devise and implement agricultural and rural policies and strategies, and to
promote the modernization of research, extension, agricultural health, and marketing services;
(ii) build organizational and individual capacities for the meshing of production chains, increase
resilience, health, inclusion, and market access; and (iii) promote innovation, with emphasis on
technologies associated with production systems, agri-business, renewable energy sources,
water harvesting, packaging, greenhouse gas management, and the improvement of seeds,
among others.

The following were the most significant results achieved through the execution of IICA’s project
portfolio:

 More competitive agricultural chains: Over 3,500 persons working in 11 chains in 20
  countries are better equipped to access markets, add value to their products, strengthen
  partnerships, create new businesses, and innovate.
 Family farming with greater opportunities: Honduras, Peru, Colombia, Paraguay, and
  Venezuela received proposed policies for improving the performance of family farming, while
  Chile, Paraguay, and Guatemala expanded the capabilities of their family farming extension
  services.
 Social inclusion in rural areas: Nine countries have area-based development plans or
  coordination entities that promote economic, social, and political integration of vulnerable


                                               94
-----------------------Page 97 End-----------------------

   groups in rural areas, such as Esmeraldas (Ecuador), Manpoliza (Guatemala), Cariri (Brazil),
   and Marowijne (Guyana).
  More resilient agro-food systems: Training was provided for 450 technical officers from 65
   institutions on implementing plans that integrate climate change management into
   agricultural programs; and another 60 received training on risk mapping.
  Agricultural health: Timely assessments were carried out on the status of current or
   potential pests and diseases, such as mollusks (Andean region), coffee leaf rust (Central
   America and Jamaica), the carambola fruit fly (Guyana and Suriname), and Huanglongbing
   (Argentina).
  Knowledge management: Through over 700 training events, the expertise of 51,750 people
   was enhanced and knowledge shared about different subjects: Codex Alimentarius, best
   agricultural practices, climate change adaptation, water management, land use, renewable
   energy sources, food safety, risk management, associative enterprises, financing, and market
   entry, among others.

 IICA directs its cooperation toward implementation of the mandates established in its 2014-
 2018 Medium-term Plan (adopted by the Inter-American Board of Agriculture - IABA), and has
 incorporated a results-based approach in its technical cooperation model, which is also based
 on in different resolutions of the regular meetings of the IABA, held in 2011, 2013, and 2015.

 Lastly, in 2016, the Institute produced 48 open access publications, as well as online courses,
 audios, videos, and information systems, all available at: http://www.iica.int/en/information-
 resources.

4.3    INTER-AMERICAN JURIDICAL COMMITTEE (CJI)

In 2016, the Inter-American Juridical Committee held two regular sessions, where it adopted
two reports: "Principles and Guidelines on Public Defense in the Americas,” which urges the
States to provide access to justice to their citizens through a free State legal assistance service;
and “Principles for Electronic Warehouse Receipts for Agricultural Products,” whose aim is to
facilitate access to credit in the agricultural sector.

The Committee adopted the resolution “International Protection of Consumers,” for the
protection of consumers in cases of online disputes arising from cross-border transactions; and
received two new mandates from the General Assembly at its 2016 session, on “Conscious and
Effective Regulation of Business in the Area of Human Rights,” and “Protection of Cultural
Heritage.” Other items on the agenda were: Immunity of States; immunity of international
organizations; law applicable to international contracts; representative democracy; guide for
the application of the principle of conventionality; and considerations on the work of the Inter-
American Juridical Committee: compilation of topics of public and private international law.

The Committee held a working meeting at Permanent Council headquarters, in Washington,
D.C., and another at its headquarters in Rio de Janeiro. In addition, in October 2016, the
Committee, jointly with the Department of International Law, held the 43 rd Course on
International Law. The Committee met with the Secretary General at OAS headquarters to
discuss matters of interest in international law.

The Committee held two roundtables: one in Washington, D.C., which discussed the future of
private international law; and another, in Rio de Janeiro, which discussed, in particular, three
matters: the work of the OAS in the codification and promotion of private international law;
international protection of consumers; and international contracts.

The Committee met with legal advisors of member states where they engaged in dialogue on
immunities, cybersecurity, international commerce, institutional agreements, and consumer
rights.


4.4    PAN AMERICAN DEVELOPMENT FOUNDATION (PADF)

Established in 1962, the Pan American Development Foundation (PADF) is a private, nonprofit,
nongovernmental institution that operates under a unique cooperation agreement concluded
with the OAS. All members of its Board work on a volunteer basis.

The PADF’s mission is to promote integral development among the region’s most
disadvantaged, in order to “create a Hemisphere of opportunity for all.”



                                                96
-----------------------Page 99 End-----------------------

A highlight of 2016 were the many activities that mobilized funding for development programs
that benefited nearly 8 million people in 18 countries, through job creation projects, technical
training, agricultural development, community development, strengthening of civil society,
human rights protection, and assistance to victims of natural disasters and humanitarian crises.
The PADF is the only independent entity of the inter-American system that contributes funds to
the OAS, and it works in coordination with groups such as the IACHR.

In 2016, the PADF continued working to rebuild Haiti following the devastating 2010 earthquake
and Hurricane Mathew in 2016.

The PADF continued to expand its programs to support displaced persons, Afro-descendants,
indigenous peoples, women victims of domestic violence, at-risk youth, and other vulnerable
groups in Colombia. The Foundation continued strengthening nongovernmental organizations
without political affiliation as an inter-American instrument to strengthen democratic values
and principles through greater citizen participation in the protection of human rights.

The PADF continued to implement its 2013-2017 Strategic Plan, and raised US$350 million
during this period, benefiting low-income communities in several countries of the region in
support of the inter-American system, and strengthening the role of communities, civil society,
and the private sector in boosting integral development in the OAS member countries.

PADF achievements in 2016

      Reached nearly 8 million in 18 countries through development and disaster response
       programs.
      Raised US$95 million in development and disaster response programs in Latin America
       and the Caribbean.
      The Ministry of Agriculture of Colombia and the PADF assisted 8,000 farmers in boosting
       their productivity and reaching new markets.
      Impacted the quality of life of nearly 4 million Colombians. Beneficiaries included
       displaced persons, conflict victims, persons of African descent, indigenous peoples,
       women, at-risk youth, and other vulnerable groups.
      Offered training on basic life skills, vocational training, and job placement services to
       over 2,500 at-risk youth in Suriname.
      Training provided for over 15,500 on the Belize coast on how to prepare for and respond
       to climate change-associated risks.
      Nearly 5,200 survivors of the Ecuador earthquake obtained access to drinking water
       through the efforts of PADF and its partners.
      8,000 persons attended a crime prevention course in Suriname, Trinidad and Tobago,
       and the Bahamas.
      1,200 Haitian families have drinking water after Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. and the

4.5    PAN AMERICAN HEALTH ORGANIZATION (PAHO)

The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), founded in 1902, serves as the World Health
Organization’s Regional Office for the Americas.

2016 was a hard year for public health in the Americas region. Having sidestepped the Ebola
epidemic without much impact, the region found itself fighting its own serious epidemic caused
by a new and unknown pathogen: the Zika virus. Following the initial detection of the virus in
Brazil in mid-2015, Zika spread throughout the region, affecting almost every country and area.
In late 2016, 48 countries and areas of the region had confirmed local vector-borne transmission
of the Zika virus.

Throughout this work PAHO maintained active coordination with the World Health Organization
(WHO), other UN agencies, and other key associates, while keeping the OAS and its member
states informed of the evolution of the epidemic and the regional response led by the WHO.



                                              99
-----------------------Page 102 End-----------------------

PAHO also provided support during other health emergencies in the region, such as the 7.8
magnitude earthquake that struck Ecuador in April 2016, affecting over 720,000; the flooding
caused by El Niño, which displaced over 130,000 in Paraguay; the nutrition crisis and food
shortages stemming from a prolonged drought in Guatemala, and the migration crises in
Colombia, Costa Rica, and Haiti. PAHO also assisted Bahamas, Cuba, Jamaica, and Haiti in their
recovery from Hurricane Matthew. In Haiti, this assistance included a cholera vaccination
campaign that reached nearly 730,000 Haitians.

Other significant achievements in 2016 were the holding of the 14 th Vaccination Week In The
Americas and the adoption by the PAHO member countries of a group of new strategies and
plans of action for the elimination of malaria and neglected diseases, and to prevent and control
the HIV infection and other sexually transmitted infections, mitigate disaster risk, and increase
health systems resilience in the region.

Other achievements of the year were the substantial progress made towards a regional
Framework of Engagement with Non-State Actors (FENSA), as part of the WHO reform process,
and the first joint evaluation performed by the Pan American Sanitary Bureau and the PAHO
member countries on the execution of the PAHO Program and Budget 2014-2015 and the first
two years of the PAHO Strategic Plan 2014-2019.
