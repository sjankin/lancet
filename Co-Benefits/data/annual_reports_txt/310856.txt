Message from the
Secretary General
As my second term as Secretary General draws to a close, I am proud to look back on how
the OSCE has responded to a rapidly evolving security landscape and the growing array
of threats and challenges facing our region in recent years. The Organization has proved
to be an effective tool for addressing conflict, providing political space for dialogue
and tools to follow up and deliver. In so doing, it has reasserted its relevance, increased
its visibility and aligned its work ever more closely with the global peace and security
agenda.
In 2016, efforts to de-escalate the crisis in and around Ukraine and restore peace and
stability in the broader OSCE region remained a central priority of the Organization. Since
the beginning of the crisis, the OSCE has responded quickly and nimbly, facilitating the
political process through the Trilateral Contact Group and efforts to reduce tensions on
the ground through the Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine (SMM). As the conflict
unfolded, the Organization adapted flexibly to new tasks, and it proved to be a bridgebuilder, trusted by all sides. Yet, as our role has evolved, expectations for the OSCE have
increased. It is worth recalling that the Organization is a facilitator, and that it is up to
the sides to end the conflict.

OSCE ANNUAL REPORT 2016

-----------------------Page 6 End-----------------------

The OSCE continued its engagement in the negotiation formats dedicated to the
protracted conflicts in the South Caucasus and Moldova. Despite a deadly spike in the
confrontation over Nagorno-Karabakh and limited progress overall, we persist in striving
towards peaceful and durable settlements to these conflicts.
Although the SMM is the most visible of the OSCE’s 16 field operations, all of them
are important partners for their host countries. They play a key role in supporting
participating States in implementing their OSCE commitments, and the Organization
always engages with host-country governments to ensure that they are providing added
value. In several cases, participating States voiced strong interest in reviewing the
mandates of certain field operations to make sure that they continue to reflect the
priority needs of their host countries. While we need not be shy about revisiting the
activities of our field operations at regular intervals, with a view to providing continuing
support to host countries, we should never lose sight of the OSCE’s core mandate to
promote security and stability. Such a review, under the leadership of the Chairmanship,
should be inclusive and transparent.
In 2016, terrorist attacks in the OSCE area and adjacent regions occurred with worrying
frequency, marking a deadly trend that has intensified in recent years. Terrorism and
violent extremism are among the most serious transnational and global challenges we
face today, along with organized crime and trafficking, mass movements of people and
climate change. Addressing these challenges effectively requires joint action at the local,
regional and global levels. We continue to strengthen our relationship with the United
Nations (UN) and other international and regional organizations. At the same time, the
Sustainable Development Goals serve as a lodestar for our activities in support of global
peace and security.
In 2016, we took steps to better define the OSCE’s role in the governance of large
movements of people. An OSCE Security Days event that I convened in Rome marked the
beginning of an informal but comprehensive discussion among participating States that
paved the way for a declaration on migration at the Hamburg Ministerial Council. This
timely effort is in step with the New York Declaration for Refugees and Migrants adopted
by the UN General Assembly in September 2016 and ties the OSCE into global efforts to
address the impact of mass migration.
Security in the OSCE area is inextricably linked to that of adjacent regions, and today’s
complex global security environment has brought us even closer to our Asian and
Mediterranean Partners for Co-operation. Strengthened OSCE engagement with our
Partners provides a valuable platform for dialogue on security issues of common concern.
We also continue to strengthen OSCE engagement with civil society, academia, media and
business. The OSCE Network of think tanks and academic institutions and the New-Med
Network continue to provide valuable analysis and recommendations. These connections
are all the more important in times of growing divisions both between countries and
within societies.
We continued to mainstream gender into OSCE policies, programmes and activities,
and we stepped up our efforts to engage young people in our debates and activities,
recognizing that youth can play an important role in preventing and resolving conflicts
and countering global and transnational challenges.
The German OSCE Chairmanship spared no effort to renew dialogue, rebuild trust and
restore security. The OSCE’s core function is to prevent conflict, so steps taken by
the Chairmanship and participating States to revitalize dialogue and strengthen the
Organization’s role in all phases of the conflict cycle were very welcome. However, both
the Hamburg Ministerial Council and the Informal Ministerial Council in Potsdam, which
provided an additional platform for open debate among ministers, once again showed
how difficult it has become to engage in constructive, forward-looking dialogue while
fundamental differences over the violation of key principles and the implementation
of commitments persist. The Chairmanship also initiated a renewal of discussions
on conventional arms control. This was a welcome attempt to renew momentum in a
fundamental area of OSCE engagement. With respect to both discussions, I sought to
stimulate informal debate by holding OSCE Security Days events in Berlin and Vienna. The

7

-----------------------Page 7 End-----------------------

Austrian OSCE Chairmanship has vowed to pursue these efforts in 2017, and I am certain
that it will invest considerable energy in fostering dialogue and rebuilding confidence.
In closing, I would like to express my deep appreciation to all OSCE staff in the
Secretariat, Institutions and field operations who through their commitment and
professionalism have tirelessly helped to fulfil heightened expectations for our
Organization in these challenging times. I am confident that the OSCE will continue
to play a major role in Euro-Atlantic and Eurasian security in the years to come. As an
inclusive platform for dialogue and joint action, the OSCE provides a unique space to
manage and overcome differences, demonstrating time and again its capacity to provide
effective responses to security challenges in our region.

Germany: Renewing
Dialogue, Rebuilding
Trust, Restoring
Security
www.osce.org/cio

Germany assumed a special responsibility for the OSCE at a time of
ongoing threats to security and co-operation in Europe and beyond.
Conflicts in the OSCE area, terrorist attacks and radicalization, the
movements of refugees and migrants and their effects on our societies or
the shrinking space for civil societies and violations of human rights and
fundamental freedoms are just some examples of the major challenges
the OSCE participating States are facing today.
Following the leitmotiv “Renewing dialogue, rebuilding trust, restoring
security”
, the German OSCE Chairmanship addressed these challenges
through efforts to promote sustainable conflict management by
providing impulses for renewed political dialogue and by identifying
ways to enable the OSCE to make best use of its potential and experience.
“I firmly believe that
the OSCE principles,
commitments and
values set out jointly
by East and West in
the past still provide
the basis and guidance
for finding peaceful
solutions to the evergrowing number of
serious security threats
we are facing today.”

CONFLICT MANAGEMENT
Conflicts in the OSCE area continued to dominate the
Organization’s agenda in 2016. In particular, the crisis in
and around Ukraine remained a key concern throughout
the year. In addition, the renewed escalation of violence
in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict in spring 2016
necessitated intensified crisis management. The German
Chairmanship invested considerable efforts in addressing
these and other conflicts with the aim of strengthening
OSCE formats for conflict resolution and improving the
living conditions of people affected by these conflicts.
The Chairmanship was able to secure the timely adoption
of the mandates and budgets of the Special Monitoring
Mission to Ukraine and the Observer Mission at the
Russian Checkpoints Gukovo and Donetsk, and provided
both field operations with political and operational
guidance, resources and capabilities. The Chairmanship
urged all parties to ensure the safety and security of the
monitors, as well as their freedom of movement, and to
implement the provisions of the Minsk agreements as the
sole framework for a political solution to the crisis in and
around Ukraine. As a member of the Normandy format and
through its Special Representative in Ukraine and in the
Trilateral Contact Group (TCG), Ambassador Martin Sajdik,
the Chairmanship contributed to regular output-oriented
discussions on the implementation of all aspects of the
Minsk agreements and to the achievement of concrete
agreements such as on disengagement of forces and
hardware.
OSCE Chairperson-in-Office and German Foreign Minister
Frank-Walter Steinmeier underpinned his commitment to
a peaceful political solution to the conflict and to the
OSCE’s indispensable role in monitoring and mediation
during two visits to Ukraine, including one to the city

12

of Kramatorsk in eastern Ukraine together with French
Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault.
With regard to the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, the
Chairmanship reacted swiftly after the escalation of
hostilities at the line of contact in April 2016, initiating
a special meeting of the Permanent Council (PC) and
advocating the implementation of agreements reached
at the presidential level in Vienna and St. Petersburg
concerning the expansion of the Office of the Personal
Representative of the Chairperson-in-Office, Ambassador
Andrzej Kasprzyk, and the establishment of an investigative
mechanism. The Chairmanship called for the resumption of
a political negotiation process to settle the conflict.
Germany also intensified efforts to create conditions
allowing further steps to be taken in the resolution of
other conflicts in the OSCE area. The Chairperson-inOffice appointed experienced diplomats Ambassador
Günther Bächler and Ambassador Cord Meier-Klodt as
Special Representatives for the South Caucasus and the
Transdniestrian settlement process, respectively. In both
areas of activity, positive developments were achieved,
as illustrated by the resumption of the Gali Incident
Prevention and Response Mechanism (IPRM) within the
framework of the Geneva International Discussions (GID)
and the resumption of the talks in the 5+2 format and
the agreement on an output-oriented roadmap in the
Transdniestrian settlement process. During his visits to
both regions, Chairperson-in-Office Steinmeier underlined
his personal commitment to the OSCE’s efforts to resolve
these conflicts and explored possibilities for further steps
towards confidence building and dialogue.

TRILATERAL CONTACT GROUP

The German Chairmanship placed particular emphasis
on further strengthening the OSCE’s capabilities in early
warning, conflict prevention, crisis management, conflict
resolution and post-conflict rehabilitation. To this end,
the Chairmanship conducted structured discussions with
participating States throughout the year. Four roundtable
discussions organized jointly with the OSCE Secretariat,
an internal workshop at the expert level, a focused
ambassadorial retreat and a side event at the ministerial
level on the margins of the 71st UN General Assembly laid
the groundwork for concrete recommendations to further
enhance the OSCE’s capabilities in this area and were
summarized in a Chairmanship report.
STRENGTHENING OSCE RESPONSES TO
SECURITY CHALLENGES
The Chairmanship invested considerable efforts into
rebuilding trust by means of renewed dialogue at all
levels and co-operation in addressing major challenges
to security and stability. To improve exchanges of
political approaches and best practices and to foster
future co-operation, the Chairmanship organized, funded
or supported more than 300 events throughout the
OSCE area reflecting the broad range of topics on the
Organization’s comprehensive agenda. The Chairmanship
placed special emphasis on introducing new elements for
inclusive, informal and output-oriented dialogue within,
and in addition to, existing formats and on stimulating
discussions about new challenges. In all formats, the
Chairmanship aimed to increase the participation of civil
society, youth and academia, people engaged in the
cultural and creative sectors and other relevant actors
and stakeholders in order to tap into the full range of
expertise and experience available.
Illustrating this approach, the Chairmanship conference
on “Connectivity for Commerce and Investment” in Berlin
in May 2016 brought together over 800 representatives
of participating States, academia, civil society, and
the business community to develop new ideas about
how to strengthen economic connectivity and good
governance in the OSCE. In the human dimension, over

REPORT OF THE CHAIRMANSHIP-IN-OFFICE

The Trilateral Contact Group and its working groups
continued their activities throughout the year
with regular meetings in Minsk co-ordinated by the
Special Representative of the OSCE Chairperson-inOffice in Ukraine and in the Trilateral Contact Group,
Ambassador Martin Sajdik.
As in previous years, a major focus of these talks
were efforts to improve the security situation and to
agree concrete steps to facilitate the implementation
of the respective provisions of the Minsk agreements.
In this context, the TCG adopted decisions on mine
action and on the prohibition of live-fire exercises,
both signed on 3 March 2016, and the framework
decision on disengagement of forces and hardware of
21 September. These decisions were prepared by the
Working Group on Security Issues co-ordinated by
Ambassador Ertugrul Apakan.
Regarding political matters, the TCG and the
Working Group on Political Issues, co-ordinated
by Ambassador Pierre Morel, conducted thorough
discussions on modalities for local elections in
certain areas of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions,
on amnesty, on the enactment of the law on special
order of self-governance in certain areas of the
Donetsk and Luhansk regions and on the so-called
Steinmeier formula, laying a solid groundwork for
discussions and future decisions in the TCG, the
Normandy format and the Ukrainian parliament.
In the humanitarian and economic fields, coordinated by Ambassador Toni Frisch and Mr. Per
Fischer, work continued on issues such as access
to, and the release of, detainees; social payments;
rehabilitation of vital infrastructure, including the
delivery of energy and water; as well as support
for the work of the international humanitarian
organizations in the conflict zone.

there focused on challenges to the European security

the part of the OSCE. Intense and, in part, controversial
debates at the ministerial level continued at the
Ministerial Council in Hamburg. These discussions and
the decisions and declarations that were adopted by
the Ministerial Council underlined the OSCE’s continuing
ability to act and to serve as a unique platform for

 23rd MINISTERIAL COUNCIL
  8–9 DECEMBER, HAMBURG, GERMANY
The 2016 Ministerial Council in Hamburg was the
culmination of the German OSCE Chairmanship’s efforts
to strengthen the OSCE in the face of growing security
threats. It was able to draw on the discussions of OSCE
foreign ministers at the informal meeting in Potsdam on
1 September 2016.
During the two-day event, discussions were led in both
the official plenary and in more informal settings, such
as a ministers-only working lunch and a dinner at the
Hamburg town hall, as well as during various topical
side events and Troika meetings with the Partners for
Co-operation. Issues of particular interest were efforts
to settle existing conflicts in the OSCE area, especially
the crisis in and around Ukraine, strengthening the
OSCE’s capacities in civilian crisis management, reviving
conventional arms control and empowering the OSCE to
effectively address new global challenges, including in
the human dimension of security.
Foreign ministers adopted ten decisions and declarations
in Hamburg. In the area of migration, participating States
agreed to use the Organization as a platform for exchange
and to continue addressing migration-related issues where
the OSCE has expertise. The Ministerial Council took a wideranging decision on strengthening good governance and
promoting connectivity in the economic and environmental
sphere. Participating States declared that they were
committed to exploring how negative developments with
regard to conventional arms control can be reversed and,
recognizing the interrelation between conventional arms
control, confidence- and security-building measures and

REPORT OF THE CHAIRMANSHIP-IN-OFFICE

The comprehensive agenda of the Hamburg Ministerial Council required intensive
preparations, 7 December 2016. (photothek)

“We are faced with the fundamental
question of whether or not we want to
continue pursuing the vision of co-operative
and comprehensive security. What was
envisaged in Helsinki, Paris and Astana is at
risk, because of both the current frequency
of international crises and the violation of
rules and principles by participating States.
But in Hamburg we took an important stand
against this trend. Despite all our differences
of opinion, we met and negotiated
constructively. We reached agreement on a
number of joint texts that reflect the OSCE’s
wide spectrum of action. However, we
cannot be content with this. We now need to
make use of this impetus and to ensure that
the OSCE becomes even more effective and
more capable of taking action in the future.”

of a structured dialogue on these matters.
In addition to the texts adopted by consensus, the 2016
Chairperson-in-Office summarized his perception of the
meeting’s proceedings in a statement of his conclusions.
Also, a summarizing report issued by the Chairmanship took
stock of the comprehensive work done throughout 2016 in
preparing the Ministerial Council. Moreover, the 2017 OSCE
Chairmanship Troika (Germany, Austria, Italy) spelled out
five lines of action in the Hamburg Declaration comprising
an agenda for future work on the part of the OSCE aimed at
promoting “a strong OSCE for a secure Europe”.
The Hamburg Ministerial Council saw the establishment
of an innovative area for debates and exhibitions in the
margins of the official meeting, named the “#mxdzone –
Hamburg Forum for Dialogue”. The first space of its kind
at an OSCE Ministerial Council served to foster exchange
among delegations, civil society representatives, media and
youth. Ahead of the Ministerial Council, the Chairpersonin-Office received recommendations from civil society that
were the outcome of an event organized in Hamburg by the
OSCE-wide NGO coalition Civic Solidarity Platform.

2016 was a difficult year, with instability and the highest
number of casualties on the front lines since the ceasefire
came into force.
Following violent clashes in April, and at the request
of the sides, the Office of the Personal Representative
conducted eight full-day visits in support of humanitarian
operations for the search and retrieval of fallen
servicemen located between the front-line positions. The
procedures used for monitoring exercises were applied to
secure the safety of the sides’ search teams and of the
International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), present
under their own mandate. During this period, the Office
kept the Chairmanship, the co-chairs of the Minsk Group
(MG) and the MG itself informed about developments on
an ongoing basis.

and enhance the effectiveness of the planning of a
possible peacekeeping operation for the area of conflict
dealt with by the OSCE Minsk Conference.

REPORT OF THE CHAIRMANSHIP-IN-OFFICE

Working in support of the Chairperson-in-Office and cochairs in negotiating a peaceful settlement, the Office of
the Personal Representative supported the Chairpersonin-Office’s visit to the South Caucasus in June and two
visits by the MG co-chairs to the region in April and
October. The Personal Representative also supported
the co-chairs in a series of separate meetings with the
foreign ministers of Armenia and Azerbaijan in February,
May, June and September, as well as joint meetings in
July and December, and helped them prepare for the
meetings of the presidents of Armenia and Azerbaijan
in May and June. Together with the co-chairs, he
participated in briefings with ministers of foreign affairs
and senior diplomats in Washington, Berlin, Moscow and
Vienna, as well as regular briefings for the MG and the
Chairperson-in-Office.
The Personal Representative also continued to co-operate
throughout the year with representatives of international
organizations, including the United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the ICRC.

Monitoring activities
With the support of the sides, the Personal
Representative and his team conducted 22
monitoring exercises, five on the ArmenianAzerbaijani border and 17 on the line of contact.
Representatives of the High-Level Planning Group
were also able to take part in four monitoring
exercises in February, May, July and October. In
addition, representatives of the Chairmanship took
part in monitoring exercises in May and October.

“We should be aware
that planning for
a peacekeeping
operation will involve
a "whole-of-OSCE
approach". It is therefore
better to adopt this approach
sooner rather than later.”

Special

Chairperson-inOffice for the
Transdniestrian
Settlement Process
In the Transdniestrian settlement process, the concretestep approach chosen by Special Representative MeierKlodt and the OSCE Mission to Moldova was unanimously
supported by mediators and observers of the 5+2 format.
A joint visit to Chisinau and Tiraspol reinvigorated the
political process, followed by a first round of official
talks in the 5+2 format, following a two-year standstill,
in Berlin on 2 and 3 June, with a substantial agenda and
a roadmap known as the Berlin Protocol.
The visit of the Chairperson-in-Office and the traditional
Bavaria Conference in July 2016 further strengthened
the process and led to a commitment by the Moldovan
Government to work out a vision for a special status for

Federation and their families residing in Latvia. The
latest available overview comprises 8,282 people falling
under the special provisions of the bilateral agreement.
As a stable trend since 2008, no individual complaints
were brought to the attention of the Commission
by military pensioners in 2016. There were no new
fundamental issues concerning the work of the
Commission throughout the past year. The 2016 report
to the Permamnent Council concluded that a stand-by
arrangement could be appropriate for the future role of
the Representative.

LEGAL FRAMEWORK
The legal status of the OSCE and its impact on
operations continued to be a focus in 2016. The German
Chairmanship and its Special Advisor, Ambassador
John Bernhard, intensified the search for solutions, in
particular during the three meetings of the informal
working group on strengthening the legal framework
of the OSCE. Short of elaborating a solution that would
grant international legal personality in accordance with
the four options discussed in the informal working group,
participating States explored ways to enhance the legal
status of the OSCE through domestic legislation and/
or through bilateral agreements with the OSCE. The
Chairmanship further supported a conference organized
by the Max Planck Institute for Comparative Public Law
and Public International Law in Berlin-Dahlem on 13
July 2016, entitled “Between Aspirations and Realities:
Strengthening the Legal Framework of the OSCE”, to
discuss issues related to the international legal status of

YOUTH AND SECURITY
MILENA STOŠIĆ, PAUL STEINER AND
ANNA-KATHARINA DEININGER
Special Representatives of the
Chairmanship-in-Office on Youth
and Security

Building upon the initiatives of the Swiss and Serbian
Chairmanships, the German Chairmanship placed a special
focus on younger generations.
In order to strengthen the voice of young people and
to increase youth participation within the OSCE, Milena
Stošić, Paul Steiner and Anna-Katharina Deininger,
three young people from the Troika countries – Serbia,
Germany and Austria – were appointed as Special
Representatives of the Chairmanship-in-Office on Youth
and Security. They advised the Chairmanship on youth
issues; voiced the views of young people on issues such
as countering radicalization and terrorism, migration and
human rights at OSCE events; and actively championed
the concerns of young people in the OSCE region.

With the aim of strengthening youth participation,
facilitating youth mainstreaming and fostering closer
co-operation in the implementation of commitments on
youth and security, the Special Representatives organized
side events at the Human Dimension Implementation
Meeting and at the Ministerial Council, as well as the
first-ever OSCE-wide meeting of OSCE Youth Focal Points,
in close co-operation with the OSCE Centre in Bishkek.
Furthermore, the Representatives supported the incoming
Austrian Chairmanship with preparations of a series of
regional youth workshops on preventing and countering
violent extremism and radicalization that lead to
terrorism.

The 2016 Serbian Chairmanship of the Asian Contact
Group actively promoted inclusive and constructive
dialogue between the OSCE participating States and the
Partners for Co-operation.
Throughout the year, the Contact Group’s chair continued
to work with the Asian Partners as suggested in the joint
work plan created by Switzerland and Serbia, who held
the 2014 and 2015 OSCE Chairmanships, respectively.
Supporting a demand-driven approach and responding to
the interests of the Asian Partners, Serbia consistently
followed up on the recommendations made in the 2014
Basel Ministerial Declaration on Co-operation with the
Asian Partners. The focus of last year’s work was to
deepen and operationalize dialogue and co-operation
with the Partners and to exchange experiences and
lessons learned on issues of mutual concern.
The Contact Group met five times in 2016 and discussed
the following topics, among others:
 The security situation on the Korean Peninsula: recent
developments and their implications for the OSCE;
 Japan’s enhanced contribution to peace, security and
stability in Asia;
 ASEAN-OSCE: enhancing co-operation between the two
regions;
 Implementation of UNSCR 1325 on Women, Peace and
Security: Australian perspectives;
 Security, stability and development in Afghanistan:
transforming threats into opportunities for younger
generations;
 Cybersecurity and the activities of the Informal
Working Group on cybersecurity, with a focus on
cybersecurity-related confidence-building measures;
 The OSCE network of think tanks and academic
institutions, its projects and activities;
 The role of the OSCE in the implementation of the
Women, Peace and Security agenda.

2016 OSCE ASIAN CONFERENCE
The 2016 OSCE Asian Conference took place in Bangkok,
Thailand, on 6 and 7 June, focusing on strengthening
comprehensive security with an emphasis on
cybersecurity, sustainable development, trafficking in
human beings and illegal migration. The event provided
a timely opportunity for OSCE participating States and
Asian Partners for Co-operation to share views and
experiences with a view to identifying avenues for
specific forms of co-operation.
The three thematic sessions reflected the OSCE’s three
dimensions while incorporating discussions on current
topics of particular interest, including the potential for cooperation in preventing and countering violent extremism
and radicalization that lead to terrorism; in combating
terrorism; in promoting measures to lift people out of
poverty and improve their living conditions; in enhancing
the role of women in social life and economic development;
and in addressing the root causes of trafficking in human
beings and irregular migration.

The major themes of the 2016 Austrian Chairmanship
of the Mediterranean Contact Group were dialogue and
inclusivity, with the first meeting attended by the Nobel
Peace Prize-winning Tunisian National Dialogue Quartet.
Youth representatives, civil society actors and religious
representatives were key participants in meetings and
other initiatives throughout the year. These events
included the first-ever retreat of the Contact Group
outside Vienna, organized together with Spain, and a
workshop on the Code of Conduct on Politico-Military
Aspects of Security, jointly organized with Switzerland
and Germany, in Amman, Jordan. The highlight of the
Chairmanship, the 2016 OSCE Mediterranean Conference,
discussed challenges for comprehensive security and
youth north and south of the Mediterranean. The OSCE’s
Mediterranean Partners for Co-operation participated
actively in various OSCE events and numerous projects.
In 2016, the Contact Group held five meetings on the
following topics:
 Strengthening dialogue and the Mediterranean
dimension of the OSCE;
 Lessons learned in dealing with the challenge of the
current migration and refugee crisis on both sides of
the Mediterranean;
 The role of dialogue and religion in preventing violent
extremism;
 Preventing and responding to the terrorist
radicalization of youth north and south of the
Mediterranean;
 Job opportunities and business creation for youth
north and south of the Mediterranean.
Political dialogue was complemented and reinforced
by a growing variety of practical co-operation projects
that covered all three OSCE dimensions and key areas
of the current OSCE and Mediterranean agendas. Most
notably, in collaboration with Spain, Austria organized
the first-ever retreat of the Contact Group outside
Vienna to discuss ways to further strengthen the OSCE
Mediterranean Partnership. The retreat was preceded by
an expert workshop on the topic of civil society dialogue
for social cohesion. The Austrian Chair also organized a
regional roundtable event in Tunisia for North African

youth on preventing and countering violent extremism.
To present the outcomes of that workshop to delegations,
it organized a side event during the OSCE Chairmanship's
counter-terrorism conference in Berlin, which dealt with
OSCE-wide issues.
2016 OSCE MEDITERRANEAN CONFERENCE
The annual Mediterranean Conference entitled “Youth
north and south of the Mediterranean: facing security
challenges and enhancing opportunities” took place on 5
and 6 October at the Hofburg in Vienna. The Conference
was attended by no fewer than ten ministers and deputy
ministers, including Libyan Foreign Minister Mohammed
Taher Siala, who reaffirmed Libya’s interest in becoming
an OSCE Partner for Co-operation. All participants
expressed the belief that the active participation of
youth representatives in all sessions of the Conference
ensured that their voices were included in discussions.

“We have to learn from one another to
prevent a lack of meaningful perspectives
and extremism both north and south of
the Mediterranean. The OSCE has the
expertise and tools to contribute with
our comprehensive security concept,
and together with other international
organizations.”
Sebastian Kurz,
Austrian Federal Minister for Europe,
Integration and Foreign Affairs

Libya was given a prominent place also due to the
participation of Martin Kobler, the UN Secretary-General’s
Special Representative and Head of the UN Support
Mission in Libya, who delivered opening remarks during
the high-level segment of the Conference. Keynote
speeches were also made by Sebastian Kurz, Austrian
Federal Minister for Europe, Integration and Foreign
Affairs; and Vincenzo Amendola, Italian Undersecretary of

Permanent Council
www.osce.org/pc

During the 2016 German OSCE Chairmanship, the weekly
meetings of the Permanent Council in Vienna were
chaired by Germany’s Permanent Representative to the
OSCE, Ambassador Eberhard Pohl.
Throughout the year, Ambassador Pohl welcomed
distinguished guest speakers to the Permanent
Council, including ministers and deputy ministers from
participating States and OSCE Partners and high-level
representatives from international organizations. Guest
speakers highlighted issues of special relevance to the
Chairmanship, such as the humanitarian situation in
the conflict zone in eastern Ukraine, migration-related
issues, Holocaust remembrance and gender equality.
Besides the work of the OSCE institutions and field
operations, various conflict settlement efforts in the
OSCE area played an important role in many of the
41 sessions of the Permanent Council in 2016. On
the crisis in and around Ukraine alone, the Personal
Representative of the Chairperson-in-Office to the
Trilateral Contact Group, Martin Sajdik, and SMM
Chief Monitor Ertugrul Apakan briefed the Permanent
Council five times. The Chairperson also called a special
meeting following the escalation of violence in the
Nagorno-Karabakh conflict zone.
The German Chairmanship strived to strengthen the
role of the OSCE Secretary General in the Permanent
Council and invited Lamberto Zannier to address the
participating States on the OSCE’s co-operation with
regional and international organizations, on migrationrelated activities and important regional developments.
Twice in 2016, the Permanent Council convened in joint
sessions with the Forum for Security Co-operation,
dedicated to the themes of dialogue for enhanced
European security and the OSCE’s work in the field of
arms control.

“The Permanent
Council served as the
central platform for
in-depth exchanges,
often reflecting the
deep divisions that must
be overcome in the OSCE area
to restore lasting security in Europe.
The German Chairmanship pursued
the objective of renewing dialogue
and rebuilding trust among OSCE
participating States. The Permanent
Council was a valuable instrument to
put these priorities into practice week
after week.”

Forum for Security
Co-operation
www.osce.org/fsc

The situation in and around Ukraine remained the dominant topic of
discussions at the Forum for Security Co-operation (FSC). An active
dialogue took place on other topical European security issues, including
arms control and CSBMs, the Code of Conduct on Politico-Military
Aspects of Security, small arms and light weapons (SALW) and stockpiles
of conventional ammunition, and subregional military and defence cooperation. The FSC adopted five decisions supporting the implementation
of existing commitments and their further development. In particular, the
FSC adopted a decision to extend the assistance on SALW and stockpiles
of conventional ammunition to the OSCE Partners for Co-operation.
Furthermore, the participating States decided to allow the publication on
the OSCE website of certain information they exchange on anti-personnel
landmines, conventional arms transfers and SALW.
A PLATFORM FOR DIALOGUE
The strategic discussions during Security Dialogues
emphasized the FSC’s importance as a platform for
addressing and discussing security issues.
All three FSC Chairmanships in 2016 – the Netherlands,
Poland and Portugal – actively stimulated discussions by
organizing a total of 19 Security Dialogues, which allowed
participating States to discuss issues related to European
security within the FSC mandate.

FSC CHAIRS

The FSC further demonstrated its relevance as a platform
for dialogue and an assistance provider in the areas
of non-proliferation and strategic trade controls. The
Forum continued to complement global efforts in these
areas by facilitating the implementation of UN Security
Council Resolutions 1540 (2004) on the non-proliferation
of weapons of mass destruction and their means of
delivery, and 1325 (2000) on Women, Peace and Security.
Discussions focused on further steps and best practices in
the implementation of these resolutions.
ARMS CONTROL AND CONFIDENCE- AND
SECURITY-BUILDING MEASURES
The issue of arms control and CSBMs was accorded
particular importance through a number of activities.
Many delegations regularly seized the opportunity of the
weekly Forum meetings to put forward their perspectives
on the crisis in and around Ukraine. The CSBMs outlined
in the Vienna Document 2011 were used to raise
and address security concerns, as well as to conduct
inspections and evaluation visits.

Under the Chairmanship of the Netherlands, the FSC
organized a High-Level Military Doctrine Seminar on 16
and 17 February, following the provisions of the Vienna
Document 2011. This event provided a much-needed
opportunity to facilitate military-to-military contacts
and to examine recent developments in participating
States’ military doctrines. The Dutch FSC Chairmanship

AND INSTITUTIONS in 2016

Under the Chairmanship of Poland, the FSC contributed
to the Annual Security Review Conference from 28 to
30 June. The discussions during Working Session II on
problems and prospects of conventional arms control and
CSBMs demonstrated that the FSC can play a key role in
promoting co-operative responses to current and future
challenges.

and Confidence- and SecurityBuilding Measures

International and Security Affairs

Under the Chairmanship of Portugal, the FSC devoted a
Security Dialogue to the changes in the role of military
forces, focusing on practical and military doctrinal
implications. Moreover, a joint meeting of the FSC and
the Permanent Council was dedicated to revisiting the
1996 OSCE Framework for Arms Control. The meeting
showed that arms control, together with disarmament
and confidence- and security-building, remains integral
to the OSCE’s comprehensive and co-operative concept of
security.
Following the discussions initiated at the FSC, a
Ministerial Declaration entitled “From Lisbon to Hamburg:
Declaration on the Twentieth Anniversary of the OSCE
Framework for Arms Control” was adopted in December
2016. The document highlights the continued importance
of conventional arms control and CSBMs for advancing
comprehensive, co-operative and indivisible security in
the OSCE area, and welcomes the launch of a structured
dialogue on the current and future challenges and risks to
security in the OSCE area.
Beyond the regular discussions on arms control and
on modernizing and updating the Vienna Document,
several participating States published a number of foodfor-thought papers and proposals for Vienna Document
Plus decisions as provided for in the Vienna Document
2011. The FSC Chairperson’s Co-ordinator for the Vienna
Document organized several informal meetings to discuss
certain aspects of updating the Vienna Document and
its reissuance. A special meeting of the FSC was held;
however, it did not result in reissuance due to a lack of
consensus.

The Forum continued to work towards enhanced
implementation of the Code of Conduct on PoliticoMilitary Aspects of Security. The fifth Annual

undiminished value of complying with all principles and
norms set out in the Code and examined its application in
the context of the current security situation in the OSCE

Throughout the Parliamentary Assembly’s
25th anniversary year, members of the
Assembly demonstrated political leadership
on such critical issues as the attempted coup
and its aftermath in Turkey, the refugee and
migrant crisis, and conflict mediation. It
was also a particularly active year for OSCE
PA election observation activities, with 334
parliamentarians participating in eight
missions across the OSCE area.

Attempted Coup in turkey and ITS
Aftermath
The PA responded rapidly to the attempted seizure
of power by factions of the military in Turkey on 15
July, with President Christine Muttonen (MP, Austria)
immediately condemning the violent attack and stressing
the importance of respecting Turkey’s constitutional
order. President Muttonen led a high-level delegation
to Turkey the next month, meeting on 16 and 17 August
with the Turkish President, Speaker of Parliament, Prime

32

Minister, Foreign Minister, opposition party leaders and
other officials.
In the following months, the PA continued to engage
with the country. While expressing solidarity with the
Turkish people following the coup attempt, PA officials
raised concerns in response to subsequent developments
over challenges to the rule of law and reiterated that
human rights must be upheld when addressing security
threats.

Providing Leadership on the Refugee
and Migrant Crisis
The Assembly was engaged on the issue of migration
throughout the year, with working visits to the Czech
Republic, France, Italy and Serbia. Members debated the
crisis at the Assembly’s Winter Meeting in Vienna, where
a special report was distributed containing concrete
proposals for action by the OSCE and its participating
States. Also at the Winter Meeting, the PA’s Standing
Committee formed an Ad Hoc Committee on Migration
to spearhead the Assembly's efforts in the field. The PA
continued to address the issue at its Annual Session in
Tbilisi and its Autumn Meeting in Skopje.
Members exchanged views on migration-related work with
government representatives of the OSCE participating
States on several occasions, providing political input to
their efforts. The PA’s Ad Hoc Committee Chair, Filippo
Lombardi (MP, Switzerland), briefed the OSCE Permanent
Council in July on the Assembly’s plan of action, which
includes monitoring the situation on the ground and
developing policy recommendations.
Promoting Dialogue on Ukraine
The crisis in and around Ukraine remained high on the
Parliamentary Assembly’s agenda. It was one of several
conflicts within the OSCE area that featured at a seminar
on conflict resolution hosted by the German delegation in
April. In June, then-President Ilkka Kanerva (MP, Finland)
paid a four-day visit to Kyiv, meeting with the Ukrainian
President, the Foreign Minister and the pilot and MP
Nadiya Savchenko, who had recently been released from a
Russian prison. In his meetings, Kanerva stressed the PA’s
support for Ukraine’s territorial integrity and called for
the full implementation of the Minsk Agreements.
These points were reiterated by President Muttonen
during a visit to Moscow in November. “Our
parliamentarians have consistently expressed grave
concern about the situation stemming from the violation
of the principles enshrined in the Helsinki Final Act,”
Muttonen said. “We support the Minsk Agreements, and
have regularly called for their full implementation.”

The 25th Annual Session of the OSCE Parliamentary
Assembly brought together nearly 300 parliamentarians
in the Georgian capital under the theme “25 Years of
Parliamentary Co-operation: Building Trust through
Dialogue”. The Session culminated in the adoption of
the 2016 Tbilisi Declaration and the election of Christine
Muttonen as Assembly President, as well as the election
of several vice-presidents and committee officers.
Autumn Meeting, Skopje, 30 September - 2 October
Winter Meeting, Vienna, 18–20 February
The 2016 Autumn Meeting of the OSCE Parliamentary
Assembly was held in Skopje under the theme
“Strengthening Confidence-Building Measures and
Good Governance in the OSCE Region”. Some 170
parliamentarians from across the OSCE area attended
the meeting. Nearly 250 parliamentarians from OSCE
participating States gathered on 25 and 26 February at
the Hofburg Congress Centre in Vienna for the Assembly’s
15th Winter Meeting, which included a special debate on
the refugee and migrant crisis.

Election Observation
The Parliamentary Assembly continued to provide
political leadership to OSCE election observation
activities throughout 2016, with PA members
serving as Special Co-ordinators of OSCE shortterm observer missions in Kazakhstan, Belarus,
the Russian Federation, Georgia, the United States
of America, Montenegro, Moldova and the former
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. OSCE PA observers
worked closely with colleagues from the OSCE Office
for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights and
other international organizations, contributing their
political experience and judgement to this essential
OSCE endeavour.

the CPC supported the organization of a confidencebuilding conference in Bavaria with participants from
Chisinau and Tiraspol in June.
The CPC supported the work of the Special Representative
of the Chairperson-in-Office for the South Caucasus,
Ambassador Günther Bächler, during the four rounds of
the GID, which address the consequences of the 2008
conflict in Georgia, and the 11 meetings of the Incident
Prevention and Response Mechanism held in Ergneti
in 2016. The CPC actively participated in numerous
consultations in Tbilisi, Sukhumi, Tskhinvali and Moscow,
and co-moderated the GID working group dealing with
humanitarian issues. In support of the GID, the CPC
organized an OSCE Summer School in Vienna to familiarize
youth from the region and beyond with OSCE values
and commitments and to build ties among populations
divided by the conflict. Other CPC projects focused on
humanitarian issues, such as missing persons from the
2008 conflict.

contribution by the Kyrgyz Government.
ACTIVITIES IN SOUTH-EASTERN EUROPE
The CPC continued to support the States Parties to
Article IV of the Dayton Peace Accords. The Centre for
Security Cooperation (RACVIAC) received the support of
the CPC in organizing the second peer review conference
for the States Parties of South-Eastern Europe to jointly
discuss and review their annual information exchange
under the Code of Conduct on Politico-Military Aspects of
Security. The CPC, with the support of the OSCE Mission
to Montenegro, organized a regional workshop on security
sector governance and reform (SSG/R). In this region,
Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro and Serbia
were assisted in disposing of surplus ammunition and
in improving the safety and security of stockpiles of
small arms and light weapons. After assistance had been

human displacement from the 19911995 conflict and remains a positive
example of regional co-operation. The
OSCE continues to provide support and
expert advice to this Programme, which
will ultimately assist approximately
27,000 of the most vulnerable refugee
families (74,000 people) with their
housing and reintegration needs.

of Security.
EARLY WARNING
The CPC continued to promote a structured and
systematic approach to early warning activities across the
Organization, specifically through the network of early
warning focal points in OSCE executive structures. In
2016, the CPC organized the fifth annual meeting of the
OSCE early warning focal point network in Vienna, with 30
representatives of field operations and other executive
structures, for information sharing and capacity building.
In recognition of the essential role of conflict analysis
for early warning reporting, CPC-facilitated conflict
analysis workshops remain a key capacity-building tool
for interested field operations. In addition, the CPC
facilitated a number of regional meetings and capacitybuilding events focused on the use of the OSCE’s overall
conflict cycle toolbox.
MEDIATION
In 2016, the CPC organized several mediation and
dialogue facilitation capacity-building events, including
coaching for Special Representatives of the Chairpersonin-Office. It also designed an assessment process to
support the exploration by the incoming Chairmanship of
possible dialogue initiatives in Ukraine. In the field of

operational guidance, it commissioned the drafting of a
study on insider mediation.
IMPLEMENTING POLITICO-MILITARY
COMMITMENTS
The CPC’s Forum for Security Co-operation (FSC) Support
Section held a dozen capacity-building events on
issues related to the Vienna Document 2011, SALW, the
Code of Conduct and other agreed CSBMs. Particularly
in Albania, Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Georgia,
Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Montenegro, Serbia and Tajikistan,
it contributed to progress in SALW and conventional
ammunition stockpile security and capacity building, as
well as in destroying surplus weapons and ammunition. In
addition, the FSC Support Section compiled all exchanged
military information and provided regular reports to
participating States. It organized several country-specific
dialogues and helped develop and implement national
action plans for the implementation of UNSCR 1540 on
the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. It
also assisted with the development of a more coherent
approach to SSG/R, particularly through the development
and launch of a set of internal OSCE guidelines.
SHARING MILITARY INFORMATION
The CPC facilitates the exchange of military information
between participating States as stipulated in the Vienna
Document 2011. This sharing of information is a key
element to building confidence and trust within the OSCE
area. The OSCE Communications Network, established by
the 1990 Charter of Paris for a New Europe, provides all
participating States with a reliable, timely and secure
channel for transmitting military information.
PROGRAMME AND PROJECT MANAGEMENT
SUPPORT
The CPC continued to provide programme and project
management support to the Secretariat and field
operations, and ensured the quality control and
compliance of all extrabudgetary project proposals with
the OSCE Common Regulatory Management System.
Expert advice was provided on 95 project proposals worth
€31.4 million, as well as on voluntary contributions
to the SMM amounting to €19.8 million. Furthermore,
the CPC facilitated training sessions on project cycle
management, programme and project planning and selfevaluation for some 173 OSCE staff members.

COUNTER-TERRORISM
Counter-terrorism remained a high priority on the OSCE’s
agenda. Preventing and countering violent extremism
and radicalization that lead to terrorism (VERLT), how
to deal with the return of foreign terrorist fighters,
activities concerning the fight against terrorism, with
a focus on youth and women, were among the subjects
discussed at the OSCE-wide counter-terrorism conference
held in Berlin. This conference’s outcomes helped to
later focus the work of the participating States as the
year concluded with an OSCE Ministerial Declaration on
Strengthening the OSCE Efforts to Prevent and Counter
Terrorism and a second Ministerial Decision on Enhancing
the Use of Advance Passenger Information (API).

40

The first Declaration reconfirmed the OSCE’s resolve
to fight terrorism in all aspects while it took positive
note of the continued implementation of the OSCE
#UnitedCVE campaign. The OSCE United in Countering
Violent Extremism (#UnitedCVE) campaign reached
some 16 million people through social media in 2016,
to raise awareness and mobilize the public in support of
efforts to prevent and counter VERLT. Several outreach
activities were organized under the campaign, including
a #LetsDoodle drawing contest to challenge violent
extremism, and a regional student competition in the
margins of the Ministerial Council in Hamburg as part
of the “Peer-2-Peer: Challenging Extremism” initiative
supported by Facebook. API shows how the OSCE actively
promotes and extends the implementation of UN Security
Council resolutions. Increasing the use of API will hamper
the ability of known terrorist suspects to move across
borders, including those returning from conflict zones.
CYBER/ICT SECURITY
Many states now consider cyber capabilities a legitimate
and necessary part of their strategic toolbox alongside
diplomacy, economic influence and military might. A key
challenge is that the intangible nature of cyberspace can
foster ambiguity, speculation and misunderstanding that
can lead to tensions or conflicts between states.
In 2016, participating States expanded the list of OSCE
confidence-building measures (CBMs) to reduce the risks
of conflicts stemming from the use of ICTs, including on
the protection of critical infrastructure, a key national
security concern. At the Hamburg MC, foreign ministers

POLICE-RELATED ACTIVITIES IN ADDRESSING
TRANSNATIONAL THREATS
TNTD focused on enhancing law enforcement co-operation
when addressing priorities in migration-related crime,
illicit drugs, counter-terrorism investigations and
cybercrime.
Through training courses and workshops, TNTD, in coordination with the Office of the Special Representative
and Co-ordinator for Combating Trafficking in Human
Beings, assisted in strengthening law enforcement
capacities to investigate cases and identify victims of
trafficking in human beings and smuggling of migrants.

further pledged to implement existing CBMs, to work
towards additional ones and to strengthen the OSCE to
work in this field.
TNTD continued supporting participating States in
implementing relevant OSCE ICT confidence-building
measures, and in 2016, the rate of implementation of
the CBMs rose to almost 90 per cent, up from 70 per cent
in 2015. In addition, a first communication check (ping
test) confirmed the readiness of nearly all participating
States to engage in crisis communication over a potential
cyber/ICT security incident between states.
BORDER SECURITY AND MANAGEMENT
Foreign terrorist fighters remain a serious challenge for
border security agencies. The OSCE has been proactive in
helping border agencies deal with this threat. The first
OSCE mobile training team is prepared to assist first-line
border officials to address this phenomenon.
The OSCE is working to improve the operational capacities
of Police Co-operation Centres and Police and Customs
Co-operation Centres in South-Eastern Europe to
ensure better information exchange and co-operation
mechanisms among the border security and management
services in the region.

In combating illicit drugs, TNTD focused on the training
of Afghan law enforcement officers, as well as capacity
building for Eastern European countries in tackling new
psychoactive substances.
TNTD and ODIHR jointly developed a training module for
law enforcement on “Counter-Terrorist Investigations and
Human Rights”. Two joint pilot training events were held
in Albania and Spain.
Intelligence-led policing (ILP) was the topic of the
2016 OSCE Annual Police Experts Meeting. The meeting
requested that TNTD draft an OSCE guidebook on ILP, due
to be published by mid-2017.
The venue of traditional crime is increasingly moving into
cyberspace. To address this new challenge, TNTD delivered
basic and advanced training courses for cybercrime
investigators in South-Eastern Europe and the South
Caucasus.
In co-operation with the German OSCE Chairmanship,
TNDT organized the OSCE-wide conference “UNGASS 2016:
Roadmap for Tacking the World Drug Problem” to discuss
proposals on how to assist the OSCE participating States
and Partners for Co-operation in implementation of the
UNGASS outcome document.

A November 2016 workshop in Malta showed the
importance of improving co-operation mechanisms in the
Mediterranean region. The event led to the development
of an initiative to establish sustainable co-operation
and exchange networks between border agencies in the
Mediterranean region.
A workshop in Dushanbe to improve co-operation
between Afghanistan and Tajikistan in combating the
increase in illicit trafficking of cultural property across
borders led to the development of similar workshops for
other regions planned for 2017.
TNDT established the OSCE Gender Equality Platform for
Border Security and Management to promote women's
leadership and mainstream gender equality on all levels in
border services.

Anti-money laundering
The Office continued to strengthen the participating
States’ ability to prevent and suppress money laundering
and to strike at the financial core of criminal activity,
including through several specialized training courses
on anti-money laundering and combating the financing
of terrorism conducted in Austria, Moldova and Ukraine.
In Tajikistan, a scoping mission and a workshop were
conducted, together with the UN Office on Drugs and
Crime (UNODC) and the Eurasian Group on Combating
Money Laundering and Financing of Terrorism, which
identified the technical assistance needs of national
authorities and provided training on skills to detect
money laundering using modern corporate vehicles
and financial instruments. In June, a regional meeting
of financial intelligence units on countering terrorism
financing was conducted in Belgrade to discuss trends
and best practices in combating terrorism financing
in the region. In October, the Office supported the
development of a money laundering national risk
assessment in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

establishing national trade facilitation committees and
developing a roadmap for implementing comprehensive
trade facilitation reforms, including a regional workshop
on trade facilitation in Astana. The OCEEA supported the
participating States’ efforts to create and strengthen
a regulatory framework that is conducive to a more
attractive business and investment climate. The OCEEA
hosted the 14th session of the UN Economic Commission
for Europe's (UNECE) Group of Experts on Euro-Asian
Transport Links in Yerevan. Recent developments in
facilitating initiatives along Euro-Asian routes to further
boost regional economic growth through improving
existing legal agreements were discussed.

Labour migration management
Capacity-building initiatives to improve labour migration
policies were identified as a result of several scoping
missions. An expert meeting organized in June allowed
the identification of priority actions in the framework
of the informal working group on migration established
under the guiding role of the Ambassador of Switzerland
to the OSCE. On 14 December, the OCEEA and the
International Organization for Migration (IOM) organized
a panel discussion in Vienna dedicated to the future
development of the UN Global Compact for Safe, Orderly
and Regular Migration. The panelists explored future
steps and challenges for upcoming negotiations aimed
at the adoption of the Compact in 2018 and how the
two organizations can jointly facilitate a broad-based
consensus in the OSCE region to this end.

Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction.
The annual gathering of the Aarhus Centres in Vienna in
November revealed the growing engagement of the 60
members of the Aarhus Centres Network in addressing
environment and security challenges in 14 participating
States. It also demonstrated the potential for the
Aarhus Centres to be players in the transition to a green
economy and resource efficiency, which will be priorities
for the OCEEA in 2017. The meeting marked the launch of
a new website, aarhus.osce.org.
Disaster risk reduction
Wildfire management continued to be at the core of
OCEEA activities in the field of disaster risk reduction. In
the South Caucasus region, the OCEEA together with the
Global Fire Monitoring Center and the Canadian Forestry
Service developed a fire danger rating system as an earlywarning tool for decision makers. The experience gained
in the South Caucasus region paved the way for launching

through co-operation on good governance,
which contributed to the Ministerial
Council Decision on Strengthening Good
Governance and Promoting Connectivity.
Over 670 participants took part in two

in Prague. Keynote speakers included
Peter Eigen, founder of Transparency
International, who emphasized the need
for a new form of co-operation between
government, the private sector and
civil society in fighting corruption. “A
triangular co-operation of state, business
and civil society can contribute to better
governance and a secure world,” he said.
Furthermore, the Economic and
Environmental Committee also
offered a constructive discussion
platform on thematic topics in the
economic and environmental field.

The Office of the Special Representative and
Co-ordinator for Combating Trafficking in Human
Beings helps participating States to better prevent
human trafficking, to prosecute those who commit
these crimes and to protect victims of trafficking.
Against the backdrop of current crisis situations
in and around the OSCE region, the Office of the
Special Representative continued to lead the OSCE’s
efforts in enhancing criminal justice responses,
providing assistance to trafficked persons and
raising awareness among vulnerable groups.

Migration and Human Trafficking
Human trafficking is largely still overlooked in situations
of crisis-driven migration. To witness first-hand the
progress made by relevant authorities in identifying
potential victims of trafficking in human beings among
mixed flows of migrants and refugees, the Special
Representative carried out several official visits to
temporary protection and reception centres, including
in Lampedusa, Italy, and Gaziantep, Turkey. These factfinding visits were critical to improving understanding
of the impact of the current crisis at grass-roots level
and facilitating the development of informed, tailormade policy recommendations, capacity-building and
awareness-raising initiatives. In Ukraine, the Special
Representative continued to work with the authorities
and the SMM to raise their awareness, as well as that
of displaced persons themselves, of the risks the crisis
poses.
Forced Criminality
The topic of the 16th Alliance against Trafficking in
Persons High-Level Conference in April 2016 focused on
the rampant yet inadequately addressed phenomenon
of human beings trafficked for the purpose of forced
criminality across the OSCE region. The conference aimed
to further enhance the ability of criminal justice systems
in our region to clearly detect forced criminality, and,
on the one hand, prosecute those really responsible and
dismantle their criminal networks, while, on the other,
applying the non-punishment principle and providing
victims with proper assistance.

Country Visits
Country visits remain integral to the OSCE’s efforts to
combat human trafficking by providing a platform for
the Office to liaise on a national level with governments,
parliamentarians, members of the judiciary, international
organizations and NGOs. These official visits are an
essential tool in accordance with the mandate of the
Special Representative for enabling and encouraging
governments to place combating all forms of human
trafficking high on their political agenda. During 2016,
the Office of the Special Representative carried out
country and follow-up visits to several OSCE participating
States, including Armenia, the Czech Republic, Romania,
Turkey and the United States of America. The office
also published country reports on the Czech Republic,
Kazakhstan, Tajikistan and the former Yugoslav Republic
of Macedonia.

PRACTICAL TRAINING FOR COMBATING HUMAN
TRAFfICKING ALONG MIGRATION ROUTES

PREVENTION OF TRAFFICKING IN HUMAN
BEINGS IN SUPPLY CHAINS

More than 55 law enforcement officials, prosecutors,
labour inspectors, financial investigators and civil
society representatives from countries of origin,
destination and transit along migration routes
participated in the OSCE's first live simulation
exercise. Focusing on trafficking for sexual and
labour exploitation, the exercise also included a
simulation of financial investigation cases, a key
element in the dismantling of complex criminal
organizations. “By enhancing criminal justice
responses to human traffickers operating along
migration routes, we aim to better equip front-line
operators to identify and protect potential victims
while ensuring the development of adequate and
effective referral mechanisms,” said Ambassador
Jarbussynova.

Seeking to prevent trafficking for all forms of
exploitation, the Office of the Special Representative
held, in Berlin in September, the first in a series of
five workshops on preventing trafficking in human
beings in supply chains through measures that
include the leveraging of government procurement.
More than 170 experts representing governments,
civil society, international organizations, the private
sector, trade unions and academia gathered to
discuss promising practices in the field of preventing
human trafficking through ethical sourcing from a
variety of perspectives. A second two-day workshop
on this topic took place at the UK Home Office
in London in November, bringing together over
40 experts and policymakers from different OSCE
participating States.

Women And Conflict
To highlight the link between gender equality and
comprehensive security, the Gender Section co-operated
with two expert institutions on strengthening the
implementation of UNSCR 1325 on Women, Peace and
Security.
The Section partnered with the Institute for Inclusive
Security to organize the OSCE-supported 1325 National
Action Plan Academy, which gathered government and
civil society practitioners from across the OSCE region.
During interactive small-group discussions, they reflected
on global trends in national action plan implementation,
considered the benefits and shortcomings of different
operational strategies and shared challenges and best
practices for advancing women’s inclusion. Participants
used Inclusive Security tools to evaluate their current or
envisioned plan architecture, identify gaps and design
potential outcomes.

To bridge the gap between policymakers and academics
working on UNSCR 1325, the Gender Section hosted the
Swedish think tank Folke Bernadotte Academy's annual
gathering of academics assessing the implementation of
this resolution. This enabled OSCE policymakers to join
in the discussions and find synergies and entry points
for co-operation with academia to strengthen the role of
women in conflict prevention and resolution.
MENTORING
The Gender Section initiated the next phase for the
establishment of mentor networks in the OSCE region.
Mentoring schemes have a great potential to empower
women and enhance their participation in all spheres of
life. The Section brought trainers from Serbia to Kyiv to
provide Roma women’s organizations with skills and tools
to implement the OSCE's practical roadmap for creating
mentor networks. The methodology will be expanded

GENDER-BASED VIOLENCE
Violence against women has a lasting impact not only
on the victim, but also on the people around her, her
community, and the wider society in which she lives;
combating it is therefore a priority for the OSCE.

Femicide is one of the gravest violations of human rights
and the most serious form of gender-based violence.
On the International Day to Eliminate Violence against
Women, the Gender Section organized a symposium in
partnership with the UNODC, the UN Special Rapporteur
on Violence against Women, the Academic Council on the
UN System and Women Against Violence Europe to raise
awareness about this issue. Participants identified areas
where data collection and analysis on femicide could be
improved and systematized, with a view to improving
prevention and response.

Democratization
In 2016, ODIHR supported independent and diverse
judiciaries, fair trial rights during times of emergency
and transition, criminal justice reform and civil society
capacity-building and advocacy. Democratic principles

52

and gender equality were promoted in parliaments,
political parties and during elections, with a focus on
political ethics and fighting corruption, strengthening
women’s role in decision-making processes and promoting
the political participation of underrepresented groups.
Responding to increasing needs, ODIHR assisted 15
participating States in developing rights-based migrant
integration and labour migration policies, trained over
500 professionals in these topics and on migrant rights
and advised on secure frameworks for the issuance
of travel documents. ODIHR’s legislative support to
participating States, appraising law-making procedures
and reviewing legislation focused in particular on
constitutional reform.
Human Rights
In 2016, ODIHR completed its third cycle of assembly
monitoring and presented a report with findings
and recommendations from observations in seven
participating States. ODIHR continued to monitor the
situation of human rights defenders across the OSCE area.
ODIHR offered capacity-building and expert advice
to state and non-state actors on human rights issues
through the organization of events and training activities.
Freedom of religion or belief, the protection of human
rights defenders, the strengthening of national human
rights institutions and human rights education were the
focus of a number of activities. Other projects covered
human rights and counter-terrorism, the policing of public
events and freedom of peaceful assembly, mainstreaming
gender and human rights in the security sector and the
prevention of torture. In co-ordination with the OSCE
Special Representative and Co-ordinator for Combating
Trafficking in Human Beings, ODIHR reactivated its antitrafficking portfolio at the end of 2016.
Tolerance and Non-Discrimination
ODIHR pursued its effort to counter hate crimes
and intolerance in 2016. This was achieved through
reporting and capacity-building efforts, publishing
data on hate crimes in the OSCE region and delivering
training programmes for law enforcement officials,
prosecutors and civil society groups. These activities
were strengthened by the launch of a three-year project
on countering anti-Semitism, the annual meeting of the
national points of contact on hate crime in November and
conferences dedicated to countering intolerance and hate

The High Commissioner on National Minorities
(HCNM) was established in 1992 to identify and
seek early resolution of ethnic tensions that might
endanger peace, stability or friendly relations
within or among OSCE participating States.
In 2016, the HCNM continued to implement her
mandate in the OSCE area to address a range of
challenges to the integration of societies and
promote good governance, respect for human rights,
including minority rights and effective equality as
fundamental to preserving stability in societies.

Integration of Diverse Societies
While visits in the OSCE region enable the High
Commissioner to obtain first-hand information and remain
at the heart of the HCNM mandate, exchanging information
and recommendations, legislative advice and project
assistance remain important tools in the HCNM’s work.
In 2016, the HCNM conducted nine visits to support
the integration of society and held events in Georgia,
Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan on education, policing and
political participation in multi-ethnic societies.
In December, the Moldovan Government adopted an
integration strategy that strengthens social cohesion
while protecting and promoting national minority rights.
The HCNM assisted in the development of the strategy.

In 2016, the safety of journalists remained the
top priority of the Office of the Representative
on Freedom of the Media, an OSCE institution
mandated to assist participating States in fulfilling
commitments on free media and free expression.

Murders, assaults and intimidation of media across the
OSCE region continued in 2016, with little progress
recorded on preventing violence or, just as importantly,
taking effective steps to apprehend and prosecute
those responsible. To quantify the extent of the issue,
Representative Dunja Mijatović produced a comprehensive
table of media professionals killed in participating States
since 1992, along with data on investigations into the

crimes and asked States to assist the Office by providing
information that would reveal the scope of the problem.
That information is to be published in early 2017.
Safety and impunity for crimes committed against
journalists were two of a plethora of issues addressed
by the Representative in her effort to help participating
States create an environment conducive to free media
and free expression.

MAJOR ISSUES
The Representative placed combating violent extremism
high on the list of priorities in 2016 and highlighted
this matter and possible solutions by issuing a
communiqué setting forth ways to protect free expression
while fighting terrorism. Shortly thereafter, she coorganized an expert meeting in Sarajevo with the OSCE

practices in the implementation of online strategies to
counter violent extremism on the Internet.

of legal, regulatory and ethical questions, the
Representative continued to address the issue by
focusing on the role of Internet intermediaries in the
newsgathering and distribution process.

The scourge of propaganda persisted unabated during
the year, as the Representative continued the battle for
professional journalism free from control and influence.
The Representative joined the Chairmanship-in-Office
in organizing an expert meeting, “Propaganda for War
and Hatred and Freedom of the Media”, at which more
than 100 journalists, media experts, diplomats and
policymakers addressed the human rights and legal
implications of propaganda.
She continued working with young journalists from
Russia and Ukraine on projects in the region designed to
build confidence among the two groups and to improve
standards of journalism ethics.
In addition, her Office arranged meetings between
representatives from the Russian and Ukrainian
journalists associations to foster dialogue and improve
professionalism. As a result of these meetings, the Office
published a book called Two Countries – One Profession,
which captures the dialogue between the groups.
Recognizing that the availability of government-held
information is essential to a fully functioning democracy,
the Representative also addressed the right of access to
information by hosting a high-level conference on the
occasion of the 250th anniversary of the passage of the
world’s first freedom-of-information act in Sweden. The
conference served as a forum for identifying important
milestones in access-to-information policy, as well as
for highlighting crucial gaps that remain in the practical
implementation of access-to-information commitments.

COMMITMENTS
The Representative’s activities can be divided into two
distinct areas: observing media developments to provide
early warning about potential challenges to media
freedom and free expression and helping participating
States to honour their commitments in those areas. In
2016, the Representative engaged the governments of
41 participating States more than 170 times on a broad
array of issues, among them violence and threats against
journalists, criminal libel charges, verdicts and prison
sentences precipitated by unfavourable media coverage
and the enactment of statutes that are damaging to
media freedom and pluralism.
TRAINING ACTIVITIES
The Representative devoted considerable time and
resources to the training and professional development of
media members, including:
 workshops for young Russian and Ukrainian journalists;
 seminars on free-expression issues for Turkish judges
and prosecutors; and
 roundtable discussions between Russian and Ukrainian

conferences for participating States in Central Asia
and the South Caucasus, bringing together media
practitioners from those areas to share experiences with
colleagues, government authorities and international
experts. In 2016, the topic of these conferences was
the multifaceted challenges to free media and free
expression. Together with the OSCE Mission to Serbia,
the Representative also held a media conference for
participating States in South-Eastern Europe called
“Gaining a Digital Edge: Freedom of Expression”.

Field operations
in 2016
The OSCE’s field operations assist host countries in putting their OSCE
commitments into practice and fostering local capacities through
concrete projects that respond to their needs. Activities vary with the
context of the individual field operation and host country, and are
governed by the mandate of each field operation. The field operations
enable the OSCE to tackle crises as they arise, and they play a critical
post-conflict role in many places, helping to restore trust among affected
communities.

Regional solutions to
regional challenges
South-Eastern Europe
Field operations in South-Eastern Europe have consistently strived to incorporate a
regional dimension into their activities in an effort to cement regional co-operation,
promote reconciliation and improve inter-community relations. Regional activities
such as the “Follow Us” project, which supports dialogue among prominent women
from Belgrade and Prishtinë/Priština, and the “Skopje Process”
, which is working
towards sustainable conditions for return and integration, contribute significantly
to promoting regional dialogue among people in the region. The Regional Housing
Programme (RHP) is another positive example of regional co-operation that
addresses human displacement from the 1991–1995 conflict and assists the most
vulnerable refugee families with their housing and reintegration needs.

Recognizing the prominent role played by young people
in reconciliation processes and in addressing emerging
challenges, such as violent extremism and radicalization
that lead to terrorism, the OSCE’s field operations in
South-Eastern Europe are stepping up their efforts
to promote regional youth exchanges and people-topeople contacts. Exchange visits and summer schools
for Albanian and Serbian youth, organized jointly by the
Presence in Albania and Mission to Serbia, are a good
example. The establishment of the Regional Youth Cooperation Office (RYCO) in Tirana – a direct outcome
of the Paris Western Balkans Summit – is an important
step towards strengthening regional co-operation. The
OSCE, through its field operations in the region, has
already begun identifying ways to engage with the RYCO
to support youth exchanges and raise the profile of the
youth and security nexus.

Acknowledging that regional co-operation is
indispensable to fighting transnational threats, the
Presence in Albania and the Mission in Kosovo are
supporting a project to enhance criminal intelligence and
proactive capabilities in the region.

60

Addressing regional challenges will remain a focus for
the South-Eastern Europe field operations in the coming
years, taking into account the Organization’s distinctive
ability to build bridges, bring people together and deliver
regional solutions.

Albanian authorities in achieving sustained progress,
improving trust in institutions and addressing
emerging regional challenges.

Supporting Citizens and Civil Society
Voter information campaigns, especially for women,
young people and Roma, were conducted ahead of
the 2016 by-elections and the planned 2017 general
elections. Participants were encouraged to cast their vote
and take a stand against family voting.

The Presence helped Albanian authorities develop local
action plans to protect children from trafficking and
exploitation. The plans were based on the findings from
an in-depth analysis and consultations with 150 child
protection professionals.

To help Albanian citizens orient themselves better in
the legislative field, the Presence launched an online
platform called "I know the law" (www.njohligjin.al).
Providing simplified legal summaries about everyday
matters, the platform has been accessed by thousands of
people so far.
The public debate on Albania’s totalitarian past
significantly increased in 2016 after the Presence
conducted a survey about citizens’ knowledge,
perceptions and expectations. Through documentaries
and a travelling theatre play, the Presence encouraged
citizens to learn more about their country’s past. With
OSCE encouragement and support, the public broadcaster
dedicated a series of discussions to this subject.

62

Community structures prescribed by the new law on
local government units were established with the
Presence’s support in four pilot municipalities. Their aim
is to improve municipal services and increase citizens’
participation in decision-making.
Enhancing THE effectiveness and
accountability of institutions
The Presence assisted Albania’s parliament in increasing
transparency and reaching out to citizens. Parliamentary
staff – trained in the past by the OSCE – provided
information sessions on democracy and civil participation
in the legislative process to around 500 high school and
university students in Presence-facilitated events. With
the Presence’s support, a cross-party constituency office
was opened in Shkodra. Members of parliament used this

office and another one established in Korça in 2015 to
exchange views with citizens.
The town of Elbasan established a local public safety
council – the first structure of this kind in Albania – with
the Presence’s assistance. The primary goal of the council
is to mobilize all local stakeholders to jointly address
issues linked to criminality, domestic violence and violent
extremism.
In 2016, the Presence assisted the Albanian government
in organizing a high-level event on the topic of foreign
terrorist fighters and irregular migration routes. It also
supports the work of the authorities on a comprehensive
action plan against cannabis cultivation and trafficking.
The Presence continued to support the improvement of
the administrative justice system in 2016 by building
the capacity of relevant stakeholders and presenting
recommendations that were developed after monitoring
administrative trials. The Justice without Delays project
was expanded to six more districts in 2016. The number
of unproductive trial sessions has been reduced in all
courts that have embraced the initiative.

“The OSCE Presence
has significantly
contributed to the
improvement of
Albanian parliamentary
activities by supporting an
increase in transparency standards and
bringing parliamentary activities closer
to citizens.”

Speaker of the Assembly of Albania

The Presence also supported the relevant authorities
in improving standards for the treatment of people
in detention, with a particular focus on the needs of
women offenders. The Presence raised awareness among
judges and prosecutors about the Probation Service,
and increased the capacity of probation officers with
respect to the psychological assessment of offenders on
probation. As a result, the use of electronic monitoring
increased from fewer than 40 cases in 2015 to over 150 in
2016.
The Presence assisted the Albanian authorities in their
demilitarization efforts. In 2016, some 160 tonnes of
two napalm components – aluminium oxide and xylenol –
were safely repacked and then shipped to France for final
disposal.
Fighting Corruption
The Presence supported Albanian authorities at the
central and local level in their efforts to fight corruption
and promote good government at all levels. Capacitybuilding events were organized to combat bribery and
promote proper conduct in business, to raise awareness
among young people of corruption-related issues and
to encourage greater engagement of civil society in
consultative processes on policy.

Partnerships
In 2016, the Presence co-ordinated
its activities with a range of Albanian
Government agencies and institutions and the
Parliament, as well as with the Council of Europe,
the European Broadcasting Union, USAID, the
EU, several UN agencies, the European Assistance
Mission to the Albanian Justice System (EURALIUS)
and the U.S. International Criminal Investigation
Training Assistance Program.

Despite increasing political tensions in Bosnia
and Herzegovina, particularly surrounding local
elections, the country saw some progress in 2016,
including with the acceptance of the country’s EU
membership application in September. Although there
are heartening signs of strong community values at
the local level, fragility in some locations was met
with rapid engagement by the Mission, once again
reflecting the crucial importance of an extensive field
presence and comprehensive response capabilities.

QUALITY, NON-DISCRIMINATORY EDUCATION
The Mission increased its engagement against the
“two schools under one roof” system, focusing on
administrative unification as a vital step towards
eliminating school segregation. In July 2016, following
the decision to establish a new school in Jajce, the
Mission engaged with state and cantonal authorities and
rallied the international community to block segregation
and support students who opposed the move. The
decision was not implemented for the 2016/2017 school
year, but remains a matter of concern.
The Mission continued its efforts to resolve the issue
concerning the Bosnian language in Republika Srpska,
where authorities created a discriminatory practice by
replacing the wording “Bosnian language” with “language
of the Bosniak people” in schools. Engagement with
interlocutors at the political and grass-roots level
prevented further escalation of tensions and school
boycotts, thereby ensuring children’s attendance in
schools and their continued education. This issue remains
to be resolved at the political level.

64

STRENGTHENING THE RULE OF LAW
Working with domestic institutions and international
partners, the Mission completed a detailed analysis of
war crimes processing at the state level and proposed
improvements in that area. Furthermore, the Mission
organized over 50 training sessions for the judiciary and
police on selected topics identified through its trial
monitoring programme. It also continued to provide
technical assistance to its counterparts in an effort to
find effective solutions to problems affecting the judicial
response to war crimes, hate crimes and trafficking in
human beings.
PREVENTING AND RESPONDING TO HATE AND
EXTREMISM
The 22 Coalitions against Hate sponsored by the Mission
organized 60 events in 24 locations across the country
during the Week of Tolerance campaign. The campaign
was aimed at encouraging all citizens to take part in
activities that promote tolerance and positive stories
related to diversity, inter-ethnic co-operation and interreligious dialogue. To counter potential prospects for
violent extremism, the Mission expanded its support for
inter-religious dialogue initiatives on the local level.
SUPPORTING REFORM PROCESSES
The Mission supported Parliamentary Assembly
Committees in organizing public discussions on issues
relevant to the country’s reform processes by inviting
the public, as well as representatives of lower-level
legislatures, government and NGOs. Political party
leaders in 18 municipalities joined the Mission-supported
initiative to create a code of ethics for the behaviour of
political parties and their candidates during pre-election
periods in the interest of fair and professional election
campaigns.

INTEGRATING THE MARGINALIZED
Significant progress has been achieved in the
implementation of the Regional Housing Programme. To
date, 1,118 beneficiaries have been selected, and 126
families have moved to new homes. The Mission, together
with the UNHCR, supports the country’s efforts to develop
tools to monitor the sustainability of return and design
actions to ensure equal access to rights and services for
returnees. The Mission supported the Ministry for Human
Rights and Refugees in developing amendments to the
Law on the Prohibition of Discrimination.
SECURITY CO-OPERATION
Bosnia and Herzegovina suffered two terrorist attacks
in 2015. Through its pioneering activities with civil
society, religious communities, youth, educators and
individual citizens, the Mission extended its assistance
to local-level actors in preventing violent extremism and
radicalization that lead to terrorism, building on the
Action Plan accompanying the Counter-terrorism Strategy
for 2015-2020. The Mission led international efforts
to guarantee safe storage of weapons and ammunition
and supported the host country in complying with its
international security commitments.
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND
ENVIRONMENTAL AWARENESS
The Mission worked with the Office of the Co-ordinator
for Economic and Environmental Activities on a
regional project to enhance disaster risk reduction that
strengthens capacities and reinforces transboundary cooperation between Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia.
Marking Earth Day, the Mission gathered decision
makers from the Herzegovina-Neretva Assembly and the
Ministry of Trade, Tourism and Environmental Protection,
local communities and Aarhus Centre leaders to discuss
environmental governance and the role of civil society in
creating relevant legislation, agendas and policies.
Election Legislation
In 2016, the Mission provided considerable support to
an inter-agency working group tasked with amending
the Law on Elections and the Law on Political Party
Financing. In co-operation with the Central Election
Commission, international partners and NGOs, multiple
recommendations from ODIHR and the Group of States
against Corruption were implemented.

Mission in Kosovo
The Mission continued its comprehensive work
with institutions and communities in Kosovo,
focusing on enhancing the response of local and
central government to the needs of non-majority
communities, on the one hand, and on strengthening
their effectiveness and accountability, on the other.
www.osce.org/kosovo
Throughout 2016, the Mission oriented its activities towards promoting
democracy and human rights. It did so through various programmes such
as the “Follow Us” initiative, the Dialogue Academy, interfaith forums and
an apprenticeship programme, with women and youth as special targets.
In addition, in two of Kosovo’s five regions, the Mission brought together
mayors and ensured their commitment to hold joint inter-ethnic initiatives
and dialogue.
In the area of human rights, the Mission worked with institutions to
create sustainable conditions for return and integration – under the Skopje
Process – as well as with the Serbian Orthodox Church and with Kosovo
institutions to advocate for the protection of cultural and religious sites.
By conducting a collection-of-votes operation on 24 April 2016, the
Mission enabled eligible voters in Kosovo to participate in the Serbian
parliamentary elections and contributed to alleviating possible tensions.

GOOD GOVERNANCE
The Mission worked closely with central and local
institutions to improve their performance and ensure
that good governance principles such as accountability,
inclusiveness and transparency were respected.
For example: it worked with the Local Government
Administration Ministry to reach out to municipalities
and mobilize support for the implementation of the 2016–
2020 local self-government strategy; developed digital
public participation platforms for the municipalities of
Prishtinë/Priština and Gjakovë/Ðakovica; and drafted
communication strategies for 16 municipalities, eight of
which were approved.
MEDIA DEVELOPMENT
Together with the European Union Rule of Law Mission
in Kosovo (EULEX Kosovo), the Mission established the
Justice Transparency Forum, a formal space for dialogue
between the media and justice institutions. Its aim is
to enhance the transparency of the justice system by
having judges and prosecutors explain court procedures
to journalists in order to ensure respect for the right
to access information, the right to privacy and the
presumption of innocence in judicial processes.

HUMAN RIGHTS
In April 2016, the Mission facilitated an agreement
between the Kosovo Police, Judicial Council, Prosecutorial
Council and Bar Association to establish a co-ordination
mechanism for the provision of free legal representation
for individuals charged with criminal offences who cannot
afford to engage private lawyers. The agreement is being
implemented by the parties and ensures consistency and
oversight over the performance of the appointed defence
counsel.

To strengthen media outlets and media pluralism in
northern Kosovo, the Mission organized a journalism
school for 20 young people. The best five candidates
were provided with an opportunity to undertake an
apprenticeship with Serbian language media, four of
whome were ultimately offered full-time employment.
PUBLIC SAFETY
At the request of the government, the Mission was closely
involved in drafting strategies and action plans on the
prevention and protection from violent extremism and
radicalization that lead to terrorism, as well as cyber and
nuclear threats. To translate these documents into action
and enrich the repertoir of methods used to address these
threats, the Mission organized various expert events and
regularly provided advice, support and expertise to the
responsible agencies and institutions. One such event
was a conference on countering violent extremism that
gathered over 200 participants and representatives from
acclaimed international and regional institutions and
organizations.

Assistance in Preparation for
Parliamentary Elections
The Mission provided technical assistance to the
State Election Commission (SEC) ahead of the October
parliamentary elections, which were held under a revised
legal framework. The Mission’s support included: a
training programme for election commissioners; helping
to develop public outreach activities, such as the redesign of the SEC’s website; and the production of TV
spots on voter education. In addition, the Mission
provided international expert advice to the news team
from the public service broadcaster prior to election day
on professional standards for the media in relation to
elections.

Promoting Principles of Gender
Equality
In partnership with the Ministry of Human and Minority
Rights, the Mission developed a video clip called “Count
Me In” that was aired on 11 TV stations during the global
campaign 16 Days of Activism against Gender-Based
Violence. The Mission also supported the development
of a commentary on the Gender Equality Law and, in cooperation with the Geneva Centre for the Democratic
Control of Armed Forces (DCAF), conducted training
courses for facilitators on the promotion of gender
equality at the Interior Ministry and Police Directorate.
The Mission continued to build the capacity of municipal
gender focal points, and started working on an analysis
of gender mainstreaming at the local level. The analysis is
based on the commitments contained in 23 memoranda of
understanding on the promotion of gender equality that
were signed by all municipalities, the Ministry for Human
and Minority Rights and the Mission.

Freedom of expression in South-Eastern
Europe
As the co-ordinator of a joint activity involving six OSCE
field operations in the region, the Mission commissioned
the production and airing of a 45-minute TV documentary
film on freedom of expression and freedom of the
media. The film addresses common challenges, such as
political and financial pressure on independent media and
journalists, lack of implementation of media legislation
and unsustainable financing of public service media.
The film places a special emphasis on the importance of
preserving the editorial independence of public service
broadcasters. The documentary was broadcast by the six
public service broadcasters in the region in December.

Strengthening Transparency and
Accountability in Local Communities
In co-operation with the Interior Ministry and the Union of
Municipalities, the Mission supported the annual programme
on best practices in local government, which provides an
opportunity to all municipalities to showcase their good
practices and present innovative solutions in the provision
of local public services. The aim of the programme is to
strengthen transparency, efficiency, accountability and to
improve the working conditions in local communities.

Fighting Cross-Border Crime
In partnership with the Office of the
National Anti-trafficking Co-ordinator,
the Mission trained more than 450
border police officers on a victimcentred approach to investigating
human trafficking, and promoted
regional co-operation in that regard.
It also supported regional border cooperation and enhancement of the work
of Montenegrin-Albanian joint patrols,
which resulted in joint operations with
neighbouring police services on drugs
seizures and supressing illegal fishing.

Supporting Implementation of the Law
on the Prohibition of Discrimination
In co-operation with the Ministry for Human and
Minority Rights, the Mission organized six training
seminars for employees of local social care centres to
implement the Law on the Prohibition of Discrimination
by fully recognizing and adequately addressing cases of
discrimination. The seminars dealt with the practical
challenges faced in implementing the law and the main
causes of discrimination.
Action Plan for a More Gender-Sensitive
Parliament
Based on the roadmap towards a gender-sensitive
parliament and in co-operation with the Parliamentary
Committee for Gender Equality, the Mission supported
the development of an action plan for a more gendersensitive parliament. The activity is supported by the
experts from ODIHR.

The Mission continued to support Serbia in strengthening
judicial independence and a merit-based selection and
career system, monitoring the legal framework and
disciplinary proceedings and providing recommendations
for improving the legal practice in this field. The Mission
fostered participatory discussions among experts
on the constitutional reform process regarding the
judiciary. To combat corruption, the Mission supported
the government, civil society and the private sector
through training activities on corporate governance as
well as on the investigation and prosecution of financial
crimes, anti-money laundering techniques and counterterrorism financing investigations. The Mission started
supporting the State Attorney’s Office to promote the
rule of law in public administration. The Mission promoted
a victim-centred criminal justice system by endorsing
the Instructions on the Operation of Prosecutorial
Victim Support Services. In the area of war crimes trial
monitoring, the Mission attended 500 hearings before the
Higher Court and Court of Appeals in Belgrade.

an advanced IT system to handle complex investigative
data that was developed and donated by the Italian
Anti-Mafia Directorate. The Mission helped organize a
meeting of organized crime prosecutors from Albania,
Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, the former
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Italy, Montenegro,
Romania, Serbia and Slovenia. This resulted in the signing
of a declaration of intent and reinforced prosecutors’
commitment to improving regional co-operation and
to identifying modalities for the direct exchange of
information. The Mission organized follow-up discussions
on the implementation of the declaration, including plans
to continue this process in 2017.

CONNECTING SERBIAN AND ALBANIAN YOUTH
To complement the efforts of the Governments of Serbia
and Albania, OSCE field operations in the two countries
supported youth connectivity, co-operation and dialogue.
In 2014, the two countries signed an agreement to
stimulate long-term youth co-operation. In 2016, 20
young men and women from both countries were trained
in digital skills and project cycle management and
learned about core OSCE committments.

MEDIA FREEDOM IN THE DIGITAL AGE
Media professionals, academia and civil society
contributed to Serbia’s upcoming Media Strategy by
providing recommendations at the “Speak Up! FollowUp” conference, organized by the Mission, together
with the Technical Assistance for Civil Society
Organizations project, the People2People Programme
and the EU Delegation to Serbia. The working group for
the development of a new Media Strategy submitted
its recommendations to the Ministry of Culture and
Information. Key recommendations cover the economic
sustainability of information and media content of public
importance, the use of new technologies in journalism
and the creation of digital information space, existing
legislation, self-regulation and media freedom and
accountability of media professionals.
Support for the development and
implementation of a national
action plan on UNSCR 1325
The Mission fostered the government’s
participatory approach in developing
the National Action Plan 2016–2020
for the implementation of UNSCR
1325 on Women, Peace and Security by
organizing five public consultations and
a final conference. The working group
and the government received Mission
support in establishing a network of 15
civil society organizations specialized
in gender and security to monitor the
implementation of the new Action Plan.

In 2016, the OSCE Mission to Skopje worked with state
authorities and civil society organizations on projects
to assist the implementation of reforms in democratic
policing, local governance, elections and the judiciary.
Support for the implementation of the Ohrid Framework
Agreement remained a priority, with special focus on
advancing inter-ethnic relations. The Mission also
focused on monitoring and providing early warning on
security-related developments, including the challenges
posed by mixed migration flows.

RULE OF LAW AND TRIAL MONITORING
Being the only international organization with the
experience and operational capacity to monitor trials in
the country, the Mission continued its trial monitoring
activities in 2016 by observing some 90 trial sessions
in 18 high-profile court cases. Additionally, the Mission
supported the monitoring of some 450 court sessions
by the NGO Coalition All for Fair Trials, which in turn
resulted in a comprehensive assessment report on the
implementation of parties’ procedural rights. The Mission
also monitored all procedural developments with regard
to cases handled by the Special Public Prosecutor’s Office.

FIELD PRESENCE
One area where the Mission continues to add value is
through its field presence, which monitors and provides
early warning on security-related developments and also
implements activities aimed at advancing constructive
inter-ethnic relations. In an effort to promote coexistence and defuse potential tensions, the Mission
undertakes confidence-building measures and facilitates
dialogue among all relevant stakeholders.

INTEGRATED EDUCATION THROUGH THE
BUILDING BRIDGES PROJECT
In addition to the Mission’s ongoing efforts to support
integration in schools, 2016 saw the continuation of the
implementation of the Building Bridges project, which
is aimed at enhancing interaction among children from
different ethnic backgrounds and strengthening interethnic relations. In 2016, the project supported 27
schools across the country, which have in turn completed
more than 70 activities involving some 800 students.

RESPONSE TO MIXED MIGRATION FLOWS AND
HUMAN TRAFFICKING
Responding to challenges posed by mixed migration
flows, the Mission used a victim-centred and human
rights-based approach when implementing specific
activities in the area of strengthening border
management and combating trafficking in human beings.
In 2016, the Mission worked to increase the capacity of
front-line social workers to identify victims of trafficking
and supported lawyers who provide legal aid for victims.
In an effort to help address the security-related aspects
of the migration issue, the Mission also deployed mobile
teams to affected border zones.

DEMOCRATIC POLICING AND FIGHTING
ORGANIZED CRIME
The Mission continued to work on strengthening the
institutional capacity of the Interior Ministry by focusing
on the principles of democratic policing in a multi-ethnic
society. To improve public trust in democratic policing,
the Mission organized roundtable discussions with 36
police officers and 45 local journalists. The role of women
in creating safer communities was also discussed with
citizens at workshops on gender-based discrimination.
The Mission organized cross-border exercises and provided
tailor-made training courses on data exchange with

COUNTERING VIOLENT EXTREMISM AND TERRORISM
In partnership with regional experts and key
stakeholders, the Mission organized a focus group
workshop on countering violent extremism that resulted
in gathering information on the causes of, and possible
responses to, this phenomenon. To strengthen the
capacity of front-line police officers in identifying and
preventing violent extremism and radicalization that lead
to terrorism, the Mission also supported the publication
of a training manual and a guidebook. Moreover, the
Mission worked to develop the capacity of youth
organizations to prevent radicalization.
PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION REFORM AND
LOCAL GOVERNANCE SUPPORT
In the run-up to the December parliamentary elections,
the Mission signed a memorandum of understanding with
the State Election Commission designed to support a
series of activities aimed at enhancing its capacities in
election administration. It also assisted in establishing
two pools of trainers, one for the implementation of
human resources management standards in municipalities
and one on functional review analysis in order to increase
the efficiency of public institutions.

Partnerships

In the light of mixed migration flows,
the Mission to Skopje increased its cooperation with the UNHCR and the IOM, as well
as with relevant state agencies and civil society
organizations on combating trafficking in human
beings and illegal migration. The Mission also
worked with OSCE field operations in Albania and
Montenegro, the Police Cooperation Convention for
South-Eastern Europe and the European Border and
Coast Guard Agency, Frontex, in organizing training
courses for border police. The Mission continued
to play an important role within the Security

The core mandate of the OSCE Mission to Moldova is
to assist in negotiating a comprehensive, peaceful and
sustainable settlement of the Transdniestrian conflict
based on the sovereignty and territorial integrity of
the Republic of Moldova within its internationally
recognized borders, with a special status for
Transdniestria that fully guarantees the human,
political, economic and social rights of its population.
To this end, the Mission facilitates interaction between
the two sides of the Dniester/Nistru River, ranging
from technical working group meetings to tackle
practical issues impacting the daily lives of people on
both banks to high-level political negotiations in the
5+2 international format on shaping a final settlement.

Highlights in 2016
 The resumption of the 5+2 negotiation
process after a two-year hiatus
with a new approach to dialogue;
 The signing of the Berlin Protocol, the
first such agreement since 2012, which
injected a new substantive outputbased dynamic into the 5+2 process;
 The adoption of a national strategy for
consolidation of inter-ethnic relations
for 2017-2027 that is consistent with
the OSCE Ljubljana Guidelines on
Integration of Diverse Societies.

74

RE-ENERGIZING THE DIALOGUE IN THE
TRANSDNIESTRIAN SETTLEMENT PROCESS
A new dynamic of strong cohesion among the mediators
and observers in the 5+2 talks was evident in the
negotiation process in 2016. This was reflected in
their joint visit in April to Chisinau and Tiraspol that
led to the resumption of the 5+2 process after a twoyear hiatus. The June 5+2 meeting in Berlin echoed the
international partners’ view that an output-based process
is a requirement for progress. The meeting resulted in
the signing of the Berlin Protocol, the first such protocol
since 2012, in which the sides committed to undertake
concrete steps to build mutual confidence, including
in the fields of ecology, education, transportation and
telecommunication. The targeted outcomes benefit the
population on both banks of the Dniester/Nistru River
and reflect the internationally agreed parameters of
the Transdniestrian conflict settlement that define the
Mission’s mandate. However, electoral campaigns after
the summer break on both banks distracted the sides
from the agreement's implementation despite several
meetings at the working group level.
ENHANCING THE SAFETY OF AMMUNITION
STORAGE SITES
In 2016, multiple storage facilities were renovated and
security and surveillance systems were upgraded. The
Mission also facilitated training courses by international
instructors from Austria, Canada, Germany, Sweden
and Switzerland on physical security and stockpile
management for 71 Moldovan officers.

OSCE ANNUAL REPORT 2016

-----------------------Page 74 End-----------------------

PROMOTING HUMAN RGHTS
The Mission facilitated public lectures in local
communities to raise awareness about free legal services
for defending people’s fundamental rights. It published a
comprehensive guide on primary legal aid and equipped
law students and paralegals with the skills and knowledge
needed to represent vulnerable individuals. In a series
of Human Rights Club meetings, the Mission brought
together 190 active lawyers from both banks of the
Dniester/Nistru River to discuss and share everyday legal
issues local people face.
In 2016, the Mission allocated almost 70 per cent of its
anti-trafficking and gender budget to address challenges
in communities outside the capital, where people are
more vulnerable and affected to a greater degree by
domestic violence and trafficking. The Mission also
supported state agencies in training police officers for
the purpose of implementing new amendments to the
Law on Domestic Violence, which are in line with ODIHR
recommendations.
STRENGTHENING FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION
Some 200 high school students from both banks of
the Dniester/Nistru River had an opportunity to hone
their debating skills at training events organized by
the Mission. The goal was to empower young people,
including representatives of national minorities, to
engage in civic life and public discussions. The Mission
also continued its efforts to strengthen professional
journalism and independent media through media
development projects, especially by building the capacity
of journalism students.
FOSTERING A RESILIENT AND INCLUSIVE
SOCIETY
Together with the High Commissioner on National
Minorities (HCNM), the Mission supported the Moldovan
Government in drafting a national strategy for
consolidation of inter-ethnic relations for 2017-2027. The
strategy was finalized at the end of 2016 and will serve
to facilitate the integration of society while protecting
the cultural and linguistic rights of minorities. In this
context, the Mission, in co-operation with the HCNM,
organized a series of events and meetings with decision

makers and representatives of national minorities. The
Mission also continued to support the HCNM in working
with the parliamentary working group, created in 2015,
to ensure the full implementation of the Republic of
Moldova’s 1994 Law on the Special Status of Gagauzia,
which created an autonomous territorial unit in southern
Moldova.

ENGAGING YOUTH THROUGH
the MODEL OSCE
The Model OSCE project brought together
32 students from both banks of the
Dniester/Nistru River who took on the
roles of OSCE participating States in a
simulation of the Permanent Council
to learn diplomacy, negotiation and
decision-making skills. The four best
performers were rewarded with a visit
to Vienna to attend a meeting of the
Permanent Council. The aim of the
Model OSCE is to teach young people
from both banks the skills needed to
promote confidence and strengthen
dialogue in order to resolve a conflict.

period 1 April 2016 to 31
March 2017, with €79,019,800

With over 1,100 members in 23 locations throughout
Ukraine, the main effort and impact of the Special
Monitoring Mission to Ukraine (SMM) is in the field.
In addition, to reduce tensions and foster peace,
stability and security, the Mission has also been
actively engaged in the work of the Trilateral Contact
Group, chairing the working group on security issues.
Progress has often been slow and sometimes even
stalled, but a notable breakthrough was reached on
21 September with the signing of the Framework
Decision on Disengagement of Forces and Hardware.
In the absence of the full implementation of the Minsk
Agreements, especially regarding a ceasefire and the
withdrawal of proscribed weapons beyond designated
lines, the Framework Decision builds on these key
elements.
The Mission also contributes to discussions held in the
Normandy format, where its monitoring and reporting
has informed decision-making. Moreover, the Mission
contributed to an event with the United Nations
General Assembly, in which the Chief Monitor gave an
assessment of the security and humanitarian situation
in eastern Ukraine.

DISENGAGEMENT
Throughout the year, the security situation in eastern
Ukraine remained volatile. In particular, the proximity
of forces and hardware has long been identified as an
exacerbating and potentially escalatory factor, with
several instances where opposing sides moved closer to
one another, resulting in major sustained flare-ups, most
notably around Yasynuvata-Avdiivka.

Therefore, the decision of the signatories on 21
September to disengage forces and hardware from three
pilot areas – Stanytsia Luhanska, Petrivske and Zolote
– was welcomed. The Mission has had a monitoring
presence in these areas since the signing of the
agreement, supported by cameras in the three areas.

made it impossible to confirm if disengagement is
complete. However, forces and hardware are still present
in the Stanytsia Luhanska disengagement area.
Violence has continued in and around Stanytsia Luhanska,
but it has decreased considerably in Zolote and Petrivske
since 21 September.
24/7 MONITORING
Given that many of the ceasefire violations occur at
night, the SMM has increased its night-time monitoring
capacity. Employing a range of technology, including
unmanned aerial vehicles and other surveillance
technology, the establishment of additional forward
patrol bases along the contact line (where a constant
presence allows for 24/7 monitoring) and the installation
of cameras in key hotspots and disengagement areas
has meant that the SMM has been able to overcome
significant risks and limitations associated with
deploying night-time mobile ground patrols. Risks,
which include the presence of mines and unexploded
ordnance, are exacerbated by the lack of visibility. Since
the increase in monitoring capacity and following the
installation of cameras, the SMM has noted decreased
levels of violence.

FIELD OPERATIONS  |  Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine

Restrictions on freedom of movement
The OSCE Permanent Council decided that SMM monitors
should have safe and secure access throughout Ukraine.
The signatories of Trilateral Contact Group decisions
have repeatedly specified that any restriction of this is
a violation. Freedom of movement on the part of SMM
monitors has, however, continued to be restricted,
including through denial of access; the jamming and
sometimes consequent downing of SMM unmanned aerial

vehicles; interference with, and destruction of, other
SMM technology; the lack of security guarantees from the
sides; direct threats to monitors’ security by positioning
and firing weapons close to them; direct pointing of
weapons at SMM monitors; and refusal to remove or fence
off mines and unexploded ordnance.
Agreed provisions for a rapid response to such
restrictions are rarely implemented, creating a sense of
impunity.
Civilian Lives on the Line
With the conflict now entering its third year, the plight
of civilians has become particularly acute. Their freedom
of movement remains curtailed, with just five approved
entry-exit checkpoints in operation along a contact
line almost 500 kilometres long. One of them – at the
destroyed Stanytsia Luhanska bridge – serves the entire
Luhansk region.

Two SMM monitors assessing the situation in the Donetsk region, 30 August 2016
(OSCE/Evgeniy Maloletka)

With state benefits unavailable and industry largely at
a standstill in areas not controlled by the government,
residents are forced to travel across the dangerous contact
line and/or rely on limited humanitarian assistance and
some financial aid from those in effective control.
The plight of civilians is worsened by major disruptions to
utility supplies when shelling damages water, electricity
and gas infrastructure. The SMM regularly engages in
facilitating and monitoring repair work, but the lack of
security guarantees from the sides sometimes restricts
access to the sites for repair crews and the SMM.

With almost 25,000 people crossing every day, often
stuck for hours and even days at what are essentially
fortified choke points, the risk of civilians getting caught
up in violence is high. Four people were killed at the
Olenivka checkpoint on 27 April when artillery shells
struck.
Many Ukrainian citizens cross to government-controlled
areas to collect pensions or buy food and medicine,
which reflects the dire socio-economic and humanitarian
conditions in areas not controlled by the government.

The OSCE Project Co-ordinator expanded its support
to Ukraine’s efforts to implement reforms during the
crisis in and around the country. The Co-ordinator
increased operations in critical areas, such as educating
the reformed police force and mine action response
units, and made substantial contributions towards
the progress of more than 30 Ukrainian partner
organizations in many other areas.

The Project Co-ordinator
supported:
 training of over 7,800 police officers from
patrol and neighbourhood services, cyber
and anti-human trafficking departments;
 participation of over 500 civic activists;
in discussions on the draft law on
public consultations and on the
concept paper on the national fund to
support civil society development;
 capacity-building activities for
over 1,500 judges in the areas of
corruption and human rights; and
 training of over 700 advocates in the
area of human rights protection.

“People must be
certain that their
constitutional rights
are protected, that
the constitutional
jurisdiction authority –
the Constitutional Court of Ukraine –
is open to addressing their concerns
through an independent and fair
process. Therefore, allowing the
Constitutional Court to receive
applications from ordinary citizens is
of paramount importance for restoring
trust in the judicial system.”

Adding impetus to justice system reform
With Ukraine making decisive moves in the reform of
its judicial system to make the judiciary independent of
political influences yet accountable to society, the Coordinator promoted inclusive dialogue in the process of
developing key legislation to reflect these changes, also
including the amendment of the country’s Constitution.
To ensure that these reforms are compliant with OSCE
commitments, the Co-ordinator supported the elaboration
of relevant laws by providing advice and legal opinions. To
strengthen the role of the Constitutional Court, the Coordinator was instrumental in introducing a constitutional
complaint mechanism, a tool enabling citizens to address
the Court if they feel the actions of the government
violate fundamental law. For the first time in the country’s
history, the Court referred to the Co-ordinator’s expert
opinion and to ODIHR's guidelines in its ruling to abolish
discriminatory provisions limiting freedom of religious
assembly.
These systemic changes were accompanied by efforts to
improve the legal education system for judges and legal
professionals, including the introduction of three online
and four trainer-led courses for judges, as well as an
entry exam at the level of a master’s degree.

Ensuring the role of civil society in
governance
After the government of Ukraine adopted a revised civil
society development strategy for 2016-2020, elaborated
with OSCE support, the Co-ordinator contributed to its
implementation by developing a draft law on public
consultations and a concept paper for the state-financed
national fund to support civic initiatives. The Coordinator also supported the National Reforms Council,
an advisory body under the President of Ukraine, in the
use of online tools to support dialogue within society
on reconciliation and reform. For further practical use
of dialogue in reforms, notably in the decentralization
process, the Co-ordinator developed an online course for
experts who are able to facilitate such dialogue.

Taking care of crisis-affected
communities
While providing an opportunity for conflict-affected
communities in eastern Ukraine to bring issues to the
attention of the central authorities at OSCE-facilitated
dialogue events, the Co-ordinator also worked to enhance
their security, notably by providing equipment to clearly
designated mine areas. International organizations noted
the appearance of markers and signs at the contact line as
one of the improvements in the humanitarian situation in
the conflict zone. Recommendations on the improvement
of access to justice in eastern Ukraine were also supported.
To help mitigate the impact of the crisis, the Co-ordinator
helped draft a state programme on the rehabilitation of
former combatants and their families and developed a
course on gender aspects of conflict for social workers,
police and military. Helping to ensure that media
coverage of the conflict is in line with journalistic ethics
and standards, the Co-ordinator supported research into
media content, provided training courses, facilitated
discussions in the media community and developed
a manual on practices related to conflict-sensitive
journalism.

Efforts to involve civil society in governance included
support for the monitoring of detention facilities to
prevent human rights violations and the development of
a methodology for monitoring court trials and training.
The Co-ordinator also began promoting a new role for
civil society in the democratic control of security sector
agencies.
Responding to threats from cybercrime,
terrorism and money laundering
The Co-ordinator helped Ukraine to develop methodology
and, for the first time, to conduct a national assessment
of risks related to money laundering and financing of
terrorism. The assessment is fundamental to identifying
weaknesses and vulnerabilities of the country’s financial
monitoring system; it is also a requirement of the
Financial Action Task Force (FATF) responsible for the
international response to those crimes. To help respond
to another growing criminality trend, the Co-ordinator
helped launch a newly reformed police cyber division by
providing equipment for education, developing curricula
and training 170 officers.

 3,778,040 people
 6,371 people in military-style uniforms
 13 funeral vans
 5 vans with a “Cargo 200”
inscription (“Cargo 200” is a known
military code used for “military
personnel killed in action”)
 10 Russian convoys observed

CONTACTS WITH RUSSIAN AUTHORITIES
AND the MEDIA
The Observer Mission further improved its relations with
authorities in the area of its operation. On 2 August,
representatives of the Russian authorities visited the
Mission’s offices in Donetsk, Gukovo and Kamensk.
This visit helped to improve information exchange
with the Russian Emergency Situations Ministry on
convoy crossings and allowed the border observers to
better communicate with people crossing at the two
checkpoints.
The Observer Mission also developed its relations with the
local media, which, as a result, began to issue a monthly
article about the Mission’s activities and the work of
its observers. This helped the local population better
understand the mandate of the Observer Mission and the
role of the OSCE in efforts to facilitate a settlement of
the crisis in and around Ukraine.

OBSERVATIONS IN TRENDS
In 2016, observers noted a 60 per cent decrease
in the number of people in military-style uniforms
crossing the two border crossing points in comparison
to 2015. The traffic of passenger and other vehicles
remained regular during the year. The average number
of people crossing the border slightly increased during
the summer and has decreased since the start of the
winter. According to the statistics from the Rostov
Region Border Guard Service, 36 per cent of the people
crossing the border between the Rostov Region and
the Donbas did so through the Gukovo and Donetsk
checkpoints.
CHIEF OBSERVER
Mr. Flavien Schaller has been the Chief Observer since
May 2016. Prior to his appointment, Mr. Schaller held a
number of positions as a career officer at the General
Staff in the Swiss Army. He succeeded Mr. Simon
Eugster, who led the Mission from October 2015 until
the end of April 2016.

Partnerships
The Observer Mission co-operated with
the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission
to Ukraine in exchanging information
concerning trains crossing into Ukraine
via the Gukovo border crossing point. The
Mission also received weekly statistics from
the Rostov Region Border Guard Service
on cross-border movement of people
between the Rostov Region and Donbas. In
September, the Observer Mission started
receiving information from the Russian
Emergency Situations Ministry regarding
Russian convoys crossing into Ukraine
through the Donetsk border crossing point.

contaminated land have been cleared. Tajikistan aspires to
meet the Ottawa Convention obligations for a mine-free
country by 2020. In September, the Office and the Centre
launched a mine risk awareness and education campaign
in the affected areas near the borders with Afghanistan
in the south and Uzbekistan in the west, alerting civilian
communities to the dangers posed by explosive materials.

WATER AND ENERGY SECURITY
In 2016, the Office, in co-operation with the Ministry
of Water and Energy Resources, conducted activities on
water resources management and renewable energy at the
national and regional levels. Following the launch of a
water sector reform programme by the host country, the
Office organized training activities on integrated water
resources management. It also worked on developing dam
safety regulations and supported research on climate
change and natural hazards in river basins.

The Office supports a network of Women’s
Resource Centres (WRCs) in 18 locations
throughout the country. They assist women
in difficulty, promote gender equality and
the empowerment of women and girls.
The WRCs offer community-based legal
assistance, psychological counselling and
vocational training. They help combat
domestic violence and human trafficking
through education programmes.
The Interior Ministry's Gender-Sensitive
Police Units, also launched with the
Office’s support, co-operate closely
with the WRCs. From 2011 to 2016, the
WRCs provided individual assistance
to over 40,000 women in crisis.

The Office strongly advocated for completing the
construction of two micro-hydropower plants in eastern
Tajikistan and connecting remote settlements with the
national electricity network.
WOMEN’S POLITICAL PARTICIPATION
To secure the participation of women in every aspect of
political and public life, the Office supports a working
group of women politicians from all established political
parties, which also includes young women activists,
members of civil society, national gender experts and
youth.
The Office also launched five regional Women Leaders
Forums where politicians, authorities and communities
discussed how to support women’s participation
in political life. Two study visits to Albania and
Serbia provided an opportunity for an exchange of
experiences related to legislation on gender quotas and
implementation of national action plans on UNSCR 1325.
THE BORDER COLLEGE – A PLATFORM FOR
the exchange of BEST PRACTICES AND COOPERATION

ADVANCING
SECURITY AND
CO-OPERATION
THROUGH
PARTNERSHIPS
Security in the OSCE area is inseparably linked
to that of neighbouring regions and can be
strengthened through dialogue and the sharing of
norms, commitments and expertise. This is why the
OSCE maintains privileged relations with 11 Asian
and Mediterranean Partners for Co-operation and
continues to build on its extensive network of cooperative relationships with other international and
regional organizations.

In 2016, the OSCE-Asian Partnership continued to serve
as a solid platform to exchange experiences and lessons
learned on issues of mutual concern with a view to
enhancing the involvement of the Asian Partners in the
OSCE’s political dialogue and activities (also see the
section on the Asian Contact Group).
The Asian Partners for Co-operation actively contributed
to OSCE dialogue and provided significant financial and
human resources to the Organization’s activities, including
the OSCE Border Management Staff College, the OSCE's
engagement with Ukraine, the OSCE's engagement with
Afghanistan and ODIHR's election observation missions.
The OSCE Secretary General actively promoted political
dialogue with the Asian Partners for Co-operation
throughout the year. In his engagement with senior
government officials from Afghanistan, Japan, the
Republic of Korea and Thailand, Secretary General Zannier
highlighted the OSCE experience and reiterated the
readiness of the Organization to share its experience
and tools in promoting sustainable and comprehensive
security. He also took part in the 2016 OSCE-Asian

The OSCE Mediterranean Partnership intensified in 2016,
as participating States and Partners for Co-operation
focused on common challenges and shared priorities,
from countering violent extremism and radicalization that
lead to terrorism to managing movements of migrants
and refugees across the Mediterranean. Mediterranean
issues were discussed at a number of high-level events,
including the Annual Security Review Conference and
the Mediterranean Conference held in Vienna on 5 and 6
October, which saw the participation of several ministers.

Throughout the year, representatives from the
Mediterranean Partners for Co-operation were involved
in OSCE Secretariat-designed projects and workshops
in the field of sustainable energy, democratic control
of armed forces and border security. Representatives of
Mediterranean Partners were also invited to participate
in the first of three simulation-based learning exercises
on combating human trafficking along migration routes,
which took place at the Centre of Excellence of Stability
Police Units in Vicenza, Italy, from 14 to 18 November.

The Austrian Chairmanship of the Mediterranean Contact
Group continued along the path of increased engagement.
Meetings in various formats focused on youth, migration,
preventing and countering violent extremism and
radicalization, intercultural and inter-religious dialogue,
as well as employment and economic development.
The Austrian Chairmanship also explored new formats.
Together with Spain and with the support of the OSCE
Secretariat, a special event was organized in Madrid
to stimulate participating States and Partners for Cooperation to discuss the situation in Libya and the future
of the OSCE Mediterranean Partnership, including possible
innovations in its format and modalities (also see the
section on the Mediterranean Contact Group).

The Secretary General continued to personally invest
in dialogue with the Mediterranean Partners, also by
promoting participation in OSCE Security Days.

Co-operation with
International and
Regional Organizations
THE SECRETARY GENERAL
United Nations (UN)
The UN-OSCE partnership was further
strengthened in 2016. Co-operation focused
on priority areas such as peacekeeping
and peace-building, disarmament and transnational
threats, tolerance and non-discrimination, as well as
women, peace and security. Upon the initiative of the
OSCE Secretary General, the UN Secretariat established a
Liaison Office on Peace and Security in Vienna, which is
expected to enhance institutional dialogue between the
two Secretariats.
The Secretary General continued to represent the OSCE
and actively contributed to several UN events. These
included the first-ever World Humanitarian Summit and
the High-Level Meeting of the UN General Assembly on
Refugees and Migrants. In his statements, Secretary
General Zannier highlighted the crucial role that regional
organizations such as the OSCE play in preventing and
addressing conflicts, as well as promoting good migration
governance.
At the operational level, 2016 saw the successful renewal
of the OSCE-UNODC Plan of Action for another two years,
and the continued implementation of the existing cooperation agreements with the UN family, including the
UNDP, the UNODA and the UNHCR.
Council of Europe (coe)
Co-operation with the CoE continued to
develop steadily in the four agreed areas of
tolerance and non-discrimination, protection of rights of
persons belonging to national minorities, the fight against
terrorism and combating trafficking in human beings. In
this framework, the two annual meetings of the CoE-OSCE
Co-ordination Group provided a good opportunity to jointly
examine a broad range of issues of mutual interest. The
Group called for strengthening synergies on initiatives
taken by both organizations to address the issue of
refugees and migrants in the medium and long term.
Close and regular expert-to-expert contacts were
developed in many areas, including the promotion of
human rights and democratization, legislative reform,
election observation, freedom of the media, gender
equality, anti-money laundering policies and other issues
of common concern.
