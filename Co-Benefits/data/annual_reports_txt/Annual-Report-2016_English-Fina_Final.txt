MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE ECOWAS COMMISSION
The year 2016 witnessed the assumption of office of new Commissioners, Vice President and President
of the ECOWAS Commission, as well as inauguration of the Fourth Legislature of the Community
Parliament.
In the area of integration, significant strides have been made in policy harmonisation and
implementation of activities geared towards the free movement of persons and goods in the
Community.
The official inauguration of the Task Force on the ECOWAS Trade Liberalisation Scheme in May 2016 in
Ouagadougou, is expected to reduce non-tariff barriers that hinder intra-regional trade development
alongside improving the current low level of trade.
It should be recalled that the Task Force is composed of seven eminent persons and chaired by Mr.
Salou DJIBO, former Nigerien Head of State.
With respect to peace and security, efforts made by the Heads of State and Government culminated in
significant progress in the consolidation of peace in Member States and resolution of the crisis in
Guinea Bissau.
However, many challenges remain in the form of terrorist attacks that continue to hit hardworking
populations particularly in Mali, Burkina Faso, Cote d’Ivoire, Niger and Nigeria.
On maritime security, it is important to emphasise the operationalisation of the West African Regional
Centre for Maritime Security (CRESMAO) based in Cote d'Ivoire, which will enhance the capacity of the
Member States concerned in the fight against maritime piracy. The implementation of the conclusions
of the recent African Union Summit held on 15 October 2016 in Lomé on Maritime Security and Safety
and Development in Africa will help develop systematic measures to combat maritime piracy, improve
security at ports and facilitate trade.
As regards the economy, the year 2016 was characterised by varying degrees of success in Member
States. While growth remained robust in certain Member States such as Cote d’Ivoire and Senegal, it
was, however, very slow, if not negative in other countries of the Community. For instance, Nigeria,
the region’s largest economy, experienced negative growth rate due to the combined effect of lower
oil prices and acts of vandalism on oil facilities in the Niger Delta region. Indeed, from 6.3% in 2014,
Nigeria’s growth rate declined to 2.7% in 2015 and IMF projections published in October 2016 indicate
a growth rate of -0.2% in 2016.
In this connection, the 2016 ECOWAS economic outlook indicates a contraction in growth rate
projected to reach -1.7% against 6.1% and 3.0% in 2014 and 2015 respectively.
In view of the challenges encountered by Member States, it is imperative to shift attention to policies
aimed at promoting the structural transformation of our economies and boosting intra-Community
trade.

In deciding on the theme of the 2015 Annual Report, “ECOWAS Common External Tariff:
Achievements, Challenges and Prospects”, we wanted to emphasise the importance of trade among
Member States in the construction of the economic and monetary union, viz, the advent of the 16th
economy that is an ECOWAS working and evolving as a single entity.
Through this theme, we also intend to call on Member States yet to ratify and implement the ECOWAS
CET, to speed up the process and urge all countries in our Community to work towards the effective
implementation of the ECOWAS Trade Liberalisation Scheme.
Our desire to build a Community of shared prosperity and achieve the aspirations of our Founding
Fathers cannot be fulfilled without true mobility of persons and goods. I avail myself of this
opportunity to express my appreciation to the Heads of State and Government for their continued
support to ECOWAS Institutions in the implementation of integration projects.
On behalf of Community Institutions, I would like to express our gratitude to the Heads of State and
Government and extend our sincere appreciation to Her Excellency Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, President of
the Republic of Liberia and current Chairperson of the ECOWAS Authority of Heads of State and
Government, for her leadership and wise counsel in steering the affairs of ECOWAS.
Our Community remains the benchmark for preventive diplomacy in the area of peace and security.
Despite a few rough spells, the region has always been able to arrive at a compromise through
dialogue, particularly under the supervision of the Heads of State and Government. In that regard, I
would like to commend the Agreement reached on the resolution of the political crisis in Guinea Bissau
alongside the conclusions of the mediation that took place from 11 to 14 October 2016 in Conakry,
under the chairmanship of His Excellency Prof Alpha Conde, President of the Republic of Guinea, which
resulted in a consensus to end the crisis. It is my hope that this agreement will mark a new beginning
for this country that has suffered so much from instability.
I should also like to express my deep gratitude to all partners who trust ECOWAS and accompany us
through various technical and financial support.
Notwithstanding the challenging environment, the results achieved in the execution of programmes
are a source of satisfaction. I, therefore, extend my warmest congratulations to all staff of Community
Institutions for their selfless dedication and contribution to the success of ECOWAS.
I am confident that together, and with the continued and renewed support of Statutory Bodies of the
Community, we will achieve ECOWAS Vision of peace, prosperity and happiness.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
i. The 2016 Annual Report was prepared from the contributions of the different Departments of
the Commission and other Community Institutions regarding the progress made in the
implementation of their work programmes in the period under review. It is divided into four
major chapters. Chapter l reviews recent economic developments in the region, against the
backdrop of the global economic environment, while Chapter II highlights the status of
implementation of the Community work programme. Chapter III covers the theme of the report
which for 2016, focuses on the implementation of the ECOWAS Common External Tariff.
Chapter IV analyses the activities of other ECOWAS Institutions and the last section presents
the conclusions and recommendations.
ii. Economic Performance: The global economy is expected to grow at 3.1 percent in 2016
compared to 3.2 percent in 2015, however, it has been forecasted to increase by 3.4 in 2017.
Factors driving the subdued performance in 2016 include shocks such as the Brexit on Euroarea, rebalancing in China, protracted low commodity prices, persistent low inflation in
advanced economies as well as noneconomic factor such as geopolitical conflicts.
III. This growth prospect differs substantially across countries and regions, with emerging Asia and
particularly India achieving a robust growth, while Sub-Sahara Africa undergoes a harsh
slowdown due to protracted low commodity prices.
iv.

West Africa, which for a long time was one of the highest performing regions of the continent,
will be the most affected by the decline in global activity in 2016. Average real GDP growth is
expected to be negative at -0.2%, compared to 3.1% in 2015. The sharp fall in the region’s
growth dynamics is due essentially to the economic recession in Nigeria, the major economy in
the region, which will record a significant drop of -1.7% in real GDP in 2016, compared to 2.7%
in 2015. However, the overall negative ECOWAS situation contrasts with the favourable
economic performance of most of the countries in the West African region. Thus, regional
economic forecasts highlight the disparities among countries and the sometimes asymmetric
nature of the shocks affecting Member States.

Macroeconomic Policy and Research
V. Monetary Integration : The Commission, in collaboration with the regional institutions involved
in the implementation of the ECOWAS Monetary Cooperation Programme, facilitated the
effective monitoring and implementation of the ECOWAS Multilateral Surveillance Mechanism
and the roadmap for the ECOWAS Single Currency through the execution of several activities
including the conduct of half-yearly Joint ECOWAS Commission – West African Monetary
Agency (WAMA)- West African Monetary Institute (WAMI) multilateral Surveillance Missions to
ECOWAS Member States to evaluate the status of macroeconomic stability and convergence in
the region.
vi. Research and Statistics: the major activities in this area concern: (i) ongoing diagnostic study on
the status of research, which led to the finalisation of the Regional Economic Research
Programme (2017-2021 RERP), ii) continued implementation of statistics harmonisation
methodology on the consumer price index, national accounts, balance of payments, and (iii)
monitoring of ECOBASE.
vii. Community Development Programme (CDP): activities revolved around preparations for the
donor roundtable for financing CDP projects, which will be held in Abidjan in March 2017. The
activities focused on the technical preparation of documents for the seven priority projects,

meetings with technical and financial partners and the private sector, with a view to obtaining
support in the organisation of the roundtable.
viii. Economic Policy Analysis Unit: activities centred on knowledge production to aid decisionmaking, including the organisation of the International Conference on child poverty and social
welfare in West and Central Africa in collaboration with UNICEF, study on innovating funding
mechanisms for the Commission and study on the reduction of travel costs at the Commission.
Private Sector Promotion, Trade, Customs, Industry, Free Movement and Tourism
ix. Private Sector: In addition to the establishment of the West African Securities Regulators
Association, (WASRA) in July 2016 by a charter among the Securities and Exchange
Commissions of Nigeria and Ghana respectively, the Commission reviewed and finalized the
draft ECOWAS Investment Code and Policy in collaboration with the Member States and
organised a Transfer Pricing Conference for all Tax and Revenue Administration authorities in
ECOWAS from 11th to 13th of October, 2016 to share experiences and build requisite capacities
in Transfer Pricing regulatory frameworks.
x. Trade: Significant progress was made in the formulation of an ECOWAS Common Trade Policy
(CTP) and the implementation of trade promotion activities in the region including the
strengthening of regional capacities in trade negotiations and the establishment of ECOWAS
Regional Competition Authority (ERCA) in The Gambia. The ECOWAS Commission also
embarked on a number of priority activities to prepare the region for the implementation of
the Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) between the EU and West Africa which has already
been signed by 28 EU countries and 14 of the 16 West African Member States.
xi. Customs: in 2016, the Commission focused efforts on making the Customs Union effective
through the application of the ECOWAS Common External Tariff (CET) and formulation of a
strategy for enhanced implementation of the ECOWAS Trade Liberalisation Scheme (ETLS).
Also, a Task Force on the trade liberalisation scheme was set up during the year to facilitate
implementation of Community texts by Member States.
xii. The ECOWAS CET is currently being implemented in ten Member States, the last country to
commence implementation was Guinea Bissau which officially launched the tariff on 24
October 2016.
xiii. In order to improve the regional trade environment and encourage Member States to implement
ETLS Protocols and Regulations as was directed by the extraordinary session of the Authority of
Heads of State held in Dakar, Senegal on 25 October 2013, a Task Force on the free movement
of goods within ECOWAS was created. Task Force members were officially inaugurated by the
President of Burkina Faso on 20 May 2016 in Ouagadougou.
xiv. Free Movement: the ECOWAS Biometric ID, which replaces the ECOWAS Travel Certificate, is
currently being implemented. Senegal, Mali and Niger were the first countries to commence
implementation.
xv. In order to check racketeering and guarantee the security of people, an operational mechanism
to monitor vehicles was launched in Cote d’Ivoire, Mali, Togo, Benin, Burkina Faso and Niger.
xvi. Tourism: ECOWAS has prepared a regional tourism policy and action plan (ECOTOUR 17/27)
which is in the process of adoption and has commenced introduction of new rules on the
classification of hotels and other accommodation and foodservice establishments.

Agriculture and Environment
xvii. Agriculture and Food Security: an appraisal of the ten years of implementation of the ECOWAS
Agricultural Policy (ECOWAP) revealed:
-

a number of activities deployed aimed at improving productivity and the production
of strategic crops (rice, maize, cassava) and livestock products through the
intensification of farming systems and improvement of productivity, as well as the
restructuring of sub-sectors;

-

implementation of initiatives by ECOWAS to guarantee food security for West
Africans through the “Zero Hunger” initiative aimed at overcoming hunger and
malnutrition by 2025. This will involve the revision and adoption of the Charter for the
prevention and management of food crises in West Africa, extended to Chad and
Mauritania and the establishment of the “Global Alliance for Resilience in Sahel and
West Africa;

-

establishment of a Regional Food Security Reserve as a regional instrument founded
on solidarity and to complement national strategies.

xviii. Other activities were carried out in the period under review including support for fruit fly control,
fertiliser development, seeds development, management of pesticides and obsolete pesticides
and cross-border transhumance and pastoralism.
xix. Environment: The Commission’s 2016 activities in the environment sector contributed to the
region’s sustainable development and focused on the three priority areas of the ECOWAS
Environment Policy, namely: (i) enhancement of environmental governance and capacity
building, (ii) promotion of sustainable resource management for the development of an
environment-friendly sub-regional economy, and (iii) enhancement of the management of
pollution, nuisance and dangerous waste.
Infrastructure Development
xx. Transport: The principal activity in the Land Transport Sector was the continued implementation
of the ECOWAS Regional Road Transport and Transit Facilitation Programme including the
ECOWAS Joint Border Posts (JBP) Programme, the Nigeria-Cameroon Multinational Highway
and Transport Facilitation Programme and the Abidjan-Lagos Corridor Development
Programme.
xxi. The principal activity in the air transport sector focused on the continued implementation and
sensitisation on the Yamoussoukro Decision (YD) for air transport liberalization with specific
focus on the World Bank “Open Sky in West Africa” Regional Air Transport Policy Reform
Programme.
xxii. Project Preparation and Development Unit (PPDU): Achievements recorded included the
establishment and operationalisation of the Project Preparation and Development Unit (PPDU)
in Lomé and the completion of some regional priority infrastructural studies including the
submission of the final study report on the establishment of a Fund for the Development and
Financing of the Transport and Energy Sectors - (FODETE-ECOWAS).
xxiii. Energy: The main activities undertaken were preparations towards the meeting of ECOWAS
Energy Experts and Ministers and the meeting of ECOWAS Agencies and Specialized Institutions
in the energy sector. The selection process for a consultant to conduct the Study for the
ECOWAS Energy Policy and the survey on rural and semi-urban electrification in West Africa
continued during the period under review. The ECOWAS Commission continued to supervise

the implementation of the emergency electrical supply programmes of ECOWAS in The
Gambia, Mali and Sierra Leone, which are now at the practical implementation phase.
xxiv.

In the mining sector, the Commission continued implementation of activities related to the
‘Promotion of Multi-stakeholder Consultation Mechanisms in all aspects of the Mineral Sector’ by
organising the ECOWAS Joint Working Group / Regional Geo-extractives Sector Civil Society
Organizations (CSOs) Joint Forum in Abuja, Nigeria. The Commission also pursued the procurement
of services for the formulation of an ECOWAS Mining and Minerals Development Act (Code,
EMMDA) and the ECOWAS Hydrocarbons Development Policy (EHDP)

Human Development
xxv. Education, Science and technology: the following major activities were carried out: organisation
of the international symposium on mathematics from 16 to 20 May 2016 in Abuja; Capacity
building workshop for Science journalists in Anglophone and Lusophony countries; and
organisation of the African Union Kwame Nkrumah Award for women scientists.
xxvi.

Humanitarian and social affairs: the main activities undertaken related to follow-up on the
commitments already made in 2015 which include the management of the post-Ebola period in
the 3 countries affected by the epidemic (Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone), including support
for orphans and survivors. ECOWAS Commission signed the grant agreements to provide these
countries with funds amounting to $70,000. The Commission also adopted its standard
framework for disaster risk management and disaster reduction.

xxvii.

Youth and Sports Development: To promote the development and empowerment of the youth
in the region and the development of sports as a tool for the promotion of regional peace, the
activities focused on sports development, youth empowerment and the volunteers
programme.

xxviii. In the area of sports development, as part of the implementation of the ECOWAS Sports Policy
adopted in 2010, several sports competitions took place in Member States, thus providing
greater visibility to ECOWAS of the People. The regular organisation of the ECOWAS traditional
wrestling tournaments impacted positively on the culture of West African regional integration
among sports movement stakeholders and enhanced the sense of belonging to the same
Community.
xxix. With respect to youth development and empowerment, the activities were part of the
implementation of the youth programme adopted in 2007. Regarding capacity building for the
youth, a partnership agreement was signed with the Centre de Formation Professionnelle de
Référence de Ziniaré (Burkina Faso) on the modules Refrigeration and Air-conditioning and
Motor Vehicles.
xxx. As part of the ECOWAS Volunteers Programme, the Commission continued the implementation
of the last activities of the Programme’s pilot phase. In that regard, the ECOWAS Commission
supported the last set of 40 ECOWAS volunteers. Consequently, on 28 July and 26 September
2016 respectively, the ECOWAS Commission organised a ceremony where certificates were
awarded to the last set of 40 ECOWAS volunteers in Sierra Leone and Guinea. The
Commission’s continued technical collaboration with the United Nations Volunteers
Programme (UNV) resulted in a financial support of more than USD 330.000 for the Volunteers
Programme.
xxxi. Drug and illegal trafficking control: The ECOWAS Commission officially launched the capacity
building programme for the ECOWAS Drug Control Unit, on the margins of the 71st Session of
the United Nations on 19 September 2016 in New York. Alongside the West African
Epidemiology Network on Drug Use (WENDU), the Commission held a technical workshop for

xxxii. Integration of Gender and Children into development programmes: The main activities centred
on the (i) launch of the pilot phase of the Business Incubator for African Women Entrepreneurs
(BIAWE) programme in Burkina Faso and Sierra Leone financed by the Spanish Cooperation
through NEPAD and (ii) holding of the technical meeting for the review of the ECOWAS
Strategic Framework on Gender and Elections in Lomé from 21 to 23 June.
xxxiii. Excellence-based scholarships for girls: In order to promote gender-equality and equity in the
education sector, the Commission is currently supporting one hundred and eighty-three (183)
brilliant but needy girls in specialised technical and professional training in all ECOWAS
Member States through the award of scholarships.
xxxiv. Medical and financial support to women and girls suffering from obstetric fistula: Activities
have been undertaken and culminated in the holding of national coordinating meetings in
thirteen (13) Member States to provide a status report on the implementation of the
programme and work out modalities for the implementation of the 2016 and 2017 programme.
xxxv. Technical and financial support to women involved in the processing of agricultural, forestry
and artisanal products: Aside the meetings the women took part in, the main activity was
capacity building in the processing of agricultural, fishery and artisanal products to enable
women create and manage profitable and sustainable businesses
Political Affairs, Regional Peace and Security
xxxvi. Political Affairs and International Cooperation: Key activities implemented included the (i)
collaboration with various development partners and attendance at several international and
regional fora to assess the security environment in the region including the adoption of the 6point roadmap to resolve the Guinea-Bissau crisis and setting up of the International Support
Group for the Consolidation of Democracy and Economic Recovery in Burkina Faso (GIS-BF).
Sensitisation workshops on awareness creation on the ECOWAS Conflict Prevention Framework
(ECPF) were organised for civil society organisations and relevant regional stakeholders to
facilitate its effective implementation in the Member States.
xxxvii. Early Warning and Response Mechanism: In order to enhance ECOWAS Member States’
capabilities to engage in the prevention, management and resolution of local and national low
intensity conflicts, the Commission, through National Early Warning and Response Mechanisms
(NEWRM), continued to undertake activities for the effective and efficient deployment of the
NEWRM through a participatory approach involving key stakeholders in the Member States.
xxxviii. Mediation and Facilitation: The Commission implemented several initiatives that helped mitigate
political tensions, and strengthened knowledge management and mediation capacity in the
region. These, among others, include supporting the efforts of the ECOWAS Special Envoy for
Guinea Bissau and the ECOWAS Mediator in facilitating political dialogue involving stakeholders
in Guinea Bissau

xl. Electoral Assistance: In line with its electoral assistance mandate, the Commission deployed a
Pre-electoral fact-finding Missions and Long Term Election Observation Missions to observe the
successful conduct of presidential and parliamentary elections in five Member States namely,
Niger, Benin, Cabo Verde, The Gambia, and Ghana.
xli. Peace Support Operations: Achievements recorded by the ESF during the review period
included the execution and evaluation of Amani Africa II Field Training Exercises; completion of
Western Accord 2016 Planning Life Cycle; and participation in several training courses including
courses in the counter-terrorism and peace. The Commission also continued with the
implementation of the ECOWAS Convention on Small Arms and Light Weapons, their
Ammunition and Other Related Materials continued both at regional and national levels based
on the 5 – year priority plan, 2010 – 2015. Sustained efforts were also made to address the
lingering outstanding financial obligations owed to the ECOWAS Mission in Guinea Bissau
(ECOMIB) and the Africa-Led International Support Mission in Mali (AFISMA).
International Cooperation and Institutional Matters
xlii. International Cooperation: The ECOWAS Commission continued measures aimed not only at
ensuring ownership of regional programmes by Member States but also strengthening
coordination in resource mobilisation for the implementation of the regional agenda in
compliance with international commitments.
xliii. In the area of development cooperation, the Commission signed Memoranda of Understanding
with the Islamic Development Bank and the African Petroleum Producers’ Association (APPA).
Other Memoranda are being finalised in particular with the International Monetary Fund and
the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa.
xliv. Strategic Planning: The Commission focused its efforts primarily on the finalisation of the
Community Strategic Framework (CSF) 2016 – 2020 through a participatory process involving
Civil Society Organizations (CSOs), Professional bodies and National Planning Experts in
Members States to ensure the alignment of the CSF with the AU Agenda 2063 and National
Development Strategies of Member States.
xlv. Monitoring and Evaluation: In line with its mandate to ensure probity and accountability in the
implementation of all regional integration programmes and projects, the Commission finalised
the Draft Result Framework for the Community Strategic Framework (CSF), 2016 -2020, and

Report, 2016 Quarterly Performance Reports and 2016 Community Performance Report.
xlvi. Communication: The Commission contributed immensely to building the capacity of Regional
journalists and media practitioners practice in understanding and reporting on the regional
integration programmes. In sustenance of its efforts to key into the online platform as a medium
to enhance visibility, the Commission upgraded and modernized the ECOWAS website to a
modernized html5 standard in which users can now access it with different kinds of devices
ranging from smartphones to computers as well as social media platforms including Facebook and
Twitter.
Other Community Institutions
xlvii. ECOWAS Parliament: At its inaugural session of the Fourth Parliament, the ECOWAS Parliament
adopted its Rules of Procedure and appointed the permanent members of its thirteen
committees. A new five-member bureau chaired by Honorable Moustapha Cissé Lo of Senegal
was appointed as well as a new management team for the general secretariat of Parliament.
Furthermore, in the 5-year Strategic Plan (2016-2020), the activity programme of the Fourth

Parliament and the draft Supplementary Act on the enhancement of the powers of Parliament
were also considered and adopted at an extraordinary session.
xlviii. ECOWAS Court of Justice: Judicial activities of the Court during the period January to October
2016 included an increase in the number of cases filled before it to 36 while the number of
sessions held stood at 75 and 25 judgements delivered and eight rulings at its headquarters.
Eleven other cases were heard at the 2016 External Court Session held in Cote d’Ivoire during
which judgements were rendered in six of the cases. On the margins of the Session in Abidjan,
the Court inaugurated the West African Jurists Association (WAJA), the culmination of years of
efforts by the Court to deliver on this platform through which it will engage with Judges and
Jurists as critical stakeholders in the sub-regional effort to develop synergy in the delivery of
justice and the enthronement of a region-wide regime of respect for the rule of law.
xlix. West African Health Organisation (WAHO): Key activities implemented to address disease
control and epidemics and health emergencies in the region included development and
validation of a regional plan on Non-communicable Diseases (NCD), provision of support to
countries for vitamin A supplementation and care for key populations under HIV AIDS control,
and the establishment of the ECOWAS Regional Centre for Surveillance and Disease Control for
addressing epidemics and health emergencies in the region. Other accomplishments included
the setting up of an expert committee to develop the herbal pharmacopoeia for the treatment
of newly emerging diseases and targeted interventions in addressing health related issues in
the various ECOWAS Member States.
l. Intergovernmental Action Group Against Money Laundry in West Africa (GIABA) : During the
year under review, in addition to attending different international meetings and conferences
on activities related to the fight against Money Laundering and Terrorism Financing (AML/CFT),
The GIABA Secretariat carried out activities as part of the mutual evaluation process, training,
technical assistance and regional and international cooperation.
li. With regard to the mutual evaluation process, GIABA undertook four (4) activities including: (i)
the on-site visit for Ghana’s mutual evaluation from 19 September to 4 October 2016.
Furthermore, as part of the training and technical assistance in the fight against money
laundering, GIABA implemented eleven (11) activities during the period under review including:
seven (7) technical workshops, two (2) advocacy visits, one (1) open day and one (1) Regional
Stakeholders’ Forum on AML/CFT emerging issues and implications for GIABA Member States..
lii. ECOWAS Bank for Investment and development: As at 30th September 2016, the operational
activities of the Bank have largely been impacted by the pressure on its treasury as a result of
the constraints linked to the lack of concessional resources to meet up with the financing
requests from Member States.
liii. The financial situation of the bank was characterised by a fall of UA 16.4 million observed in the
balance sheet, while a surplus of UA 4.2 million was realized.
liv. In the area of resources mobilisation, the Bank continues to intensify efforts in mobilizing
adequate resources to finance its project portfolio, ensure its viability and its profitability. In
this regard, some arrears of the first and second tranches of the called-up capital for a total
amount of UA 10.2 million were paid to the Bank.
lv. Notwithstanding these, the major challenge facing the Bank remains the mobilization of
adequate resources, especially at the Community level. To this end, the payment of the arrears
on the first and second tranches of the called up capital by all Member States constitutes an
important leverage to mobilize resources from other partners. In the same vein, it has become
necessary to put in place in the ECOWAS region, a mechanism for the mobilization of

concessional resources with a view to financing major infrastructure projects to accelerate
regional integration. In this regard, the strengthening of cooperation with the ECOWAS
Commission portends good prospects.
Conclusion and Recommendations
lvi. The review of the status of implementation of the Community's work programme, despite the
current challenges that slowed the pace of implementation of the activities, mainly during the
first half of the year, shows a good level of execution.
lvii. The results achieved in this particularly difficult context reflect the commitment of men and
women committed to the causes of regional integration. Therefore, in order to continue and
strengthen the current dynamism and consolidate ECOWAS Institutions, the following
recommendations are made to the Member States:
-

Continue efforts at the structural transformation of the economies of the region and
the development of infrastructure in the light of developments in the international
economic environment;

-

Continue and intensify efforts to implement the regional integration programmes
such as the ECOWAS CET, trade liberalisation scheme, free movement of persons and
goods;

-

Continue efforts at consolidating good macro-economic management of the national
economies, a necessary condition for the establishment of a stable and viable
monetary union;

-

Compliance with the provisions of the protocol on Community levy;

-

Sustained efforts at the consolidation of regional peace and security;

-

Accelerate the institutional reforms of the commission and other institutions with a
view to making them more efficient and operational.

INTRODUCTION
1.

The year 2016 was marked by the renewal of Management with the appointment of a new
President for the Commission as well as new members of the Community Parliament. The region
equally faced many security challenges during the year under review.

2.

Despite the challenges, significant results have been achieved in the area of peace and security as
well as in the implementation of regional integration programmes and policies. The remarkable
progress made in the implementation of the ECOWAS Common Agricultural Policy, which is being
assessed this year and the application of the Common External Tariff in most Member States
consolidate the efforts of Community Institutions to make the ECOWAS Economic and Monetary
Union come into effect.

3.

With regard to the economy, the recent economic downtrend in Nigeria, the region’s largest
economy, has continued unabated. The fact that Nigeria’s economy went into recession in the
second quarter of 2016 negatively affected the economy of some Member States. The expected
growth rate for 2016 would be -1.75%. Due to the poor performance of the Nigerian economy,
ECOWAS growth rate initially projected to reach 3% would decline to -0.2% in 2016.

4.

In the area of regional peace and security, the year under review was marked by significant
progress in the fight against terrorism and political instability. The Nigerian Government’s military
strikes against Boko Haram in the North-Eastern part of the country succeeded in weakening the
sect alongside reducing the frequency and death toll resulting from the operations of the sect, as
well as its influence in the area. Despite the success recorded by the military intervention, Boko
Haram continues to launch isolated attacks in the area particularly in Borno State and Niger
Republic.

5.

What is more, the increased number of clashes between farmers and cattle breeders is regarded
as a security concern for the region. Although this situation is currently widespread in Nigeria, it
also poses a real threat in Cote d'Ivoire and Ghana. Repeated clashes between herdsmen and
farmers have caused thousands of deaths. There is the need to implement a coordinated system
for exploiting natural resources linked to transhumance (pasture, water and salt), which could
promote a conflict-free environment and be beneficial to both farmers and cattle breeders.

6.

While reviewing 40 years of ECOWAS in 2015, the Heads of State and Government reaffirmed their
determination to make every effort to achieve the vision, values, commitments and principles of
ECOWAS Founding Fathers, particularly with regard to:
-

7.

achieving Free Movement of Persons and Goods;
establishing the Common Market;
consolidating Peace, Security and Good Governance and
making Community Institutions more efficient through the full implementation of
reforms.

These commitments therefore served as guidelines for the preparation of the 2016 Community
Work Programme. Thus, with a view to accelerating the regional integration process and
consolidating the achievements of Community Institutions, the following areas have been selected
in conformity with the ECOWAS Strategic Plan in order to:
-

ECOWAS Commission

support political reforms aimed at improving socio-economic integration in the area
of Free Movement of Persons and Goods, Security and Food Self-sufficiency;
sustain the process for the integration of economies in the global market and step
up the monetary integration;
promote infrastructural development and a competitive business environment;

The 2016 Annual Report is structured into four major chapters. Chapter I reviews recent economic
developments of the region within the context of the global economic environment. Chapter II
highlights the status of implementation of the Community Work Programme. Chapter III deals with
the theme of the report which, this year, focuses on the implementation of the ECOWAS Common
External Tariff and Trade Liberalisation Scheme while Chapter IV reviews the activities of other
ECOWAS Institutions. The last section is on conclusion and recommendations

CHAPTER I: RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS IN WEST AFRICA.
1.1

Global economic situation

9.

Global economy has been forecast to grow at a slower pace of 3.1 percent in 2016 compared to
3.2 percent in 2015. However, growth is expected to be recuperating to 3.4 percent in 2017. Based
on quarterly economic performance reviews, global economic performance has been slackening
successively since the beginning of the year. This fading trend is mainly the result of a slowing
down in emerging and developing economies, particularly in China, Russia and Brazil. Advanced
economies performed better in the first and second quarters of the year, even though they too are
now portraying signs of fatigue. The main factors responsible for this subdued performance in
2016 include some new shocks such as the Brexit vote on June 23, 2016, rebalancing in China and
adjustment of commodity exporters to protracted decline in the terms of trade due to persistent
low commodity prices. Other factors have also contributed to the global economic downturn,
including low world trade, low inflation in advanced economies, or non-economic factors such as
geopolitical conflicts.

10.

This growth prospect differs considerably across countries and regions, with emerging Asia,
particularly India, achieving a robust growth, while Sub-Sahara Africa undergoes a harsh
slowdown. Generally, downward revision was made to the growth forecast for the commodity
exporters, in the midst of serious domestic uncertainties and a more challenging external
environment. The subdued outlook for the advanced economies is mainly due to the uncertainty
and downside risks that may arise from the Brexit and weaker–than-expected growth in the US
economy in the third quarter of 2016.

11.

The value of world output is projected to increase by 2.19 percent from US$73.599 trillion in 2015
to US$75.213 trillion in 2016 and further increase by 5.75 percent in 2017 to reach US$79.536
trillion output. (Table 1). These modest increases in 2015 and 2016 were preceded by a severe
decline in the value of global output by 5.7 percent in 2014 due mainly to the sharp decline in
commodity prices that year. The sluggish increase in the world output is due to less than expected
pickup in global commodity prices and decline in the China’s economy following the domestic
rebalancing as well as gradual adjustment of commodity exporting countries to the protracted low
commodity prices.

12.

The major areas of concerns that are likely to have significant impact on the 2016 economic
outlook and forecast include the following: The emergence of political tensions and inward-looking
policies in advanced economies such as the Brexit vote and the ongoing US Presidential election
campaign which has raised concerns about cross border economic integration and the impact of
foreign competition on jobs and wages.

13.

Stagnation in industrialized countries as global growth remains weak, hence the scare of
protracted decline in private demand and investment, especially in extractive industry, which may
further exacerbate the already sluggish growth and lower inflation and in some cases deflation.

14.

China’s ongoing adjustment and its consequence on other economies still persist. The effect of
China’s rebalancing from reliance on investment, industry and exports in favour of greater
dependence on consumption and services could trigger uncertainty than anticipated. This may
have further serious implications for commodity and machinery exporting countries and those that
relays heavily on China for financial services.

15.

The fragile financial situations in emerging countries - high corporate debts, declining profitability
and high banks’ bad debts and commodity dependence leaves the economies exposed to external
shocks without any serious defensive mechanism.

16.

Other noneconomic factors in various regions such as severe shortage of rainfall in eastern and
southern Africa, civil and domestic conflicts in Middle East and North Africa, refugee crisis in
Europe and Zika virus disease in Latin America and Caribbean are having
devastating
consequences on global economic activities.

Most industrialized countries are at various stages of post-crisis recovery but are generally
expected to post weak growth in 2016. High and rising public debt and near -zero lower bound
monetary policy rate are some of the concerns of these economies. Thus, growth is projected to
rise by 2.1 percent in 2016 compared to 1.9 percent in 2015. However, due to recent economic
developments, especially in Europe and and America, the momentum cannot be sustained in the
coming years. Growth is expected to be down to 1.8 percent in 2017.

18.

In US, economic activities remain subdued in spite of the development of optimism in the second
and third quarters of the year. GDP is forecast to grow by 1.6 percent in 2016 compared to 2.1
percent in 2015. Employment growth and positive housing trends, supported by consumer
spending, are not a sufficient stimulus for the economy to perform better than 2015 level. The
effect of continued appreciation of the dollar on manufacturing activity and lower oil prices
limiting investment in extractive industry and equipment, are the crucial sources of sluggish U.S
economic performance. The US economy is forecast to grow at 1.8 percent in 2017. However, a
combination of rising wage levels and low productivity provides an increasing threat to the
forecast.

19.

The Euro-Area is projected to post a modest growth of 1.7 percent in 2016 compared to 2.0
percent in 2015. In general, the short-term economic environment in Europe is relatively
favourable compared to other advanced economies as improvement in domestic demand and

labour markets continue to sustain the current moderate performance. Investment and output are
forecast to continue to improve considerably in the medium term. However, the forecast is
dependent on the final outcome of the Brexit on the rest of the Euro-Area Economy which, for the
moment, is not very much felt outside the United Kingdom.
20.

In Japan, the economy is expected to grow at the same rate as n 2015, at 0.5 percent. The
economy is barely growing despite the injection of fiscal stimulus in recent years trying to
stimulate growth and fight deflation. The economy is also suffering from currency appreciation,
having appreciated more than 18 percent against the US dollar in 2016. That hurts exporters by
making goods produced in Japan more expensive abroad.

21.

in the emerging markets and developing countries is expected to improve slightly to 4.2 percent in
2016 compared to 4.0 percent in 2015; growth is expected to pick up to 4.6 percent from 2017
onward. However, the forecast for this group is uneven and fragile because of some glaring
challenges. These conditions include a slowing pace of growth in China, which has chain effects
because of the import dependent and nature of the economy. Commodity exporting countries will
continue to have terms of trade difficulties because of lower revenues, the effect of persistent
weak demand in advanced countries and several political discords and tensions. In addition, while
emerging Asia, particularly China and India, continue to post impressive growth, Nigeria, South
Africa and Angola, the biggest economies in Africa, are facing sharp declines, even recession in
some cases, mainly as a result of lower commodity prices and domestic political conditions. The
challenging macroeconomic situations facing Brazil and Russia are expected to continue.
However, recent forecast indicated an improvement and they may as well be heading out of
recession.

Figure 1 Global economic performance

22.

In terms of growth performance, Latin America is trailing behind the other regions. Sharp and
continuous falls in oil and commodity prices have adversely impacted Latin American economies,
especially Brazil, the biggest economy in the region. Growth of the region is expected to decline to
-0.6 percent in 2016 compared to 0.0 percent in 2015. Regarding Brazil, even though economic
indicators point to the direction that the economy may be out of recession, as it is expected to
post a positive growth of 0.5 percent in 2017, it still requires more foreign investment and private
intervention as well as integration of the informal sector into the formal modern business sector
to lift the economy out of the woods.

In Sub-Sahara Africa, the current positive growth projection is still tentative because of the
protracted low commodity prices, as well as fragile growth in Nigeria and South Africa. The region
is facing eminent slowdown of their economies with growth rates falling from 5.1 percent in 2014
to 3.4 in 2015 and now projected to further decline to 1.4 percent in 2016, which is the region’s
slowest growth performance in two decades. Weaker exports demand, lower commodity prices,
net capital inflow and weak investment growth and, in some cases military conflict, natural
disaster and adverse weather effects on agricultural output, exerted downward pressure on
growth. Notwithstanding, the region still has a lot of prospects for economic development in the
medium to long term, largely due to its huge demographic dividend and sufficient opportunities
for catch-up. However, significant challenges including political and institutional constraints
remain to be overcome.

Average global inflation continues to decline amid persistently subdued economic activity, modest
wage growth and lower commodity prices. In 2015, average inflation in advanced economies was
estimated at 0.3 percent, the least since 2009, due to declining oil and commodity prices.
However, in 2016 it is projected to rise to 0.8 percent as the effects of oil prices moderate.
Inflation level in Emerging Markets and Developing Economies is expected to be maintained at 4.7
percent in 2016, same as in 2015, due to stable exchange rates. In developing countries, inflation
is expected to rise in 2016 due to currency depreciation in a number of countries and higher
import prices.

Risks of deflation, however, still persist in developed countries, mainly in Japan and the Euro Area,
and to a lesser degree in US. Low energy prices is the main driver of the current disinflationary
situation in the advanced economies. In response, many central banks have reduced interest rates
to the barest minimum and introduced relevant monetary policies.

Growth of the African Economy
Growth forecasts indicate a further slowdown of Africa’s Gross Domestic Product. Following the
decline to 3.3% in 2015, the continent’s real growth rate will slump to 1.7% in 2016, its lowest
level in at least two decades. Economic difficulties in major African economies (in particular
Nigeria and South Africa), which feel the impact of falling commodity prices, contribute to the
downturn. This negative trend is observed in all the main regions1 of the continent, even though
the scale of contraction in global activity is quite heterogeneous (see table 1 and figure 2).

West Africa, with 30% and 28% of Africa’s population and GDP respectively (at current price in
2015), is the hardest hit by the downswing in overall economic activity. Its average real GDP
growth is set to decelerate sharply to -0.2%, largely due to the economic recession in Nigeria, the
region’s largest economy. The region’s wealth is projected to decrease to USD 571.4 billion in 2016
against USD 637.4 billion in 2015. Consequently, ECOWAS‘ average per capita income is expected
to decline by almost 13% to USD 1629 compared to USD 1866 in 2015. However, West Africa’s
overall negative situation contrasts with the favourable economic performance of most countries
in the region. Section 1.3 below provides a detailed analysis of ECOWAS Member States’ growth
prospects and provides the opportunity to better appreciate the disparities and at times, the
asymmetric nature of shocks that affect Member States.

28.

Southern Africa, accounting for 17% and 23% of the continent’s population and GDP respectively,
is the second region expected to record a sharp deceleration in its real GDP growth. The 2016
projected growth rate of 0.7% is a marked downturn compared to the 2% achieved in 2015.

Nominal GDP would decline to USD 472.4 billion in 2016 against USD 528.2 billion in 2015. This
mixed result that has now lasted several years is largely due to the difficult economic situation in
South Africa, the region’s largest economy, which is set for a sluggish real growth in 2016 (0.12%).
Since the onset of the global financial crisis in 2008, the country has been affected more than any
other country in the region, and even on the continent, by the negative impact of the fragile
international economic conditions. To a lesser extent, Southern Africa’s difficult economic
situation is also spurred by a significant decline in growth in Angola (0%) which is affected by the
adverse consequences of falling commodity prices, most especially oil.
Figure 3 : Real GDP growth of African regions

29.

Central Africa represents 11% and 5% of Africa’s population and GDP respectively. Real GDP
growth is projected to fall from 3.7% in 2015 to 1.8% in 2016, following the expected downturn in
overall economic activity in oil producing countries such as Equatorial Guinea and Chad, whose
growth rates are set to decline to -9.9% and -1.1% respectively. In addition, the recurrent political
violence due to lack of consensus on the electoral process in Congo and DRC continue to cast
serious doubts on the economic prospects of these countries whose real GDP would decrease
from 6.9% to 2.3% in 2015 and from 3.9% to 1.7% in 2016 respectively.

30.

East Africa would consolidate its position as the continent’s most dynamic region in recent years,
particularly in the wake of the economic meltdown in West Africa. Although in decline, its real
growth would be sustained in 2016 at 4.2% following the rate of 6.2% achieved in 2015, that is,
2.5% above Central Africa (3.7%) which occupies the second position in terms of growth rate. East
Africa’s economy would grow by 4 percentage points above the African average (1.7%) and 4.3
points above Sub-Saharan Africa (1.4%). This positive and sustained performance is largely due to
the robustness and economic dynamism of Ethiopia, Kenya and Tanzania. As regards the first
country, its growth rate would be pegged at 6.5% in 2016, following the strong acceleration of
10.2% in 2015. With respect to Kenya, its real GDP would increase to 6% in 2016 against 5.6% a
year ago. Finally, growth in Tanzania would remain at 7.2% in 2016, following the rate of 7%
recorded in 2015.

31.

North Africa is gradually recovering from the Arab Spring and has become Africa’s leading
economy with share of 30% of the Continent’s GDP (at current price in 2015). It took over this
position from ECOWAS in the wake of the Nigerian recession. Although in a slight decline of 2.9%
compared to 3.3% in 2015, its 2016 projected economic growth is well above this level following
the political crisis in Egypt, the region’s largest economy, and Tunisia. The positive momentum

recorded in recent years is linked to the return to growth in those two countries, which is
expected to be pegged at 3.8% and 1.5% in 2016 against 4.2% and 0.8% in 2015 respectively. The
region’s positive result is also due to the relative performance of Algeria, the second largest
economy in North Africa, whose growth rate would slightly decrease to 3.6% in 2016 compared to
the 3.9% recorded in 2015. However, the continuing crisis in Libya is affecting the region’s
economic strength.
1.3 West African Economies
32.

Representing 17% and 30% of Africa’s surface area and population respectively, West Africa (or
ECOWAS) is the most densely populated area on the continent. It is one of the best performing
regions in terms of production, accounting for 28% of GDP at current price on the entire continent
and 40% of Sub-Saharan Africa’s GDP in 2015

1.3.1. Economic growth
33.

Real growth of the ECOWAS region has consistently been above 5% from the beginning of 2000
until 2014, mainly driven by the dynamism of the Nigerian economy, which is by far West Africa’s
economic powerhouse (nearly 70% of the region’s GDP). The region’s economic forecasts clearly
underpin this pro-cyclical bias, that is reflecting the fluctuations of the Nigerian economy (see
table 3 and 4).

Growth prospects suggest an economic recession in 2016, with an expected growth rate of -0.2%,
which has been unprecedented for about two decades. The main reason for this significant
slowdown in the region’s growth dynamics is the fall in commodity prices, particularly oil, which
declined by at least 50% since the last quarter of 2014. The adverse cumulative effects of the
sharp reduction in oil prices on the Nigerian economy, Africa’s largest oil producer, are quite
critical and are summed up as follows: sharp fall in export revenues, sharp depreciation of the
Naira, resulting in a drop in real GDP, which is expected to fall sharply to -1.7% against 2.7% in
2015 (see table 5).

Although strongly significant for the region’s economic growth prospects, the negative result
recorded by Nigeria appears to be an isolated case (see table 3 and 4). Thus, in 2016, economic
growth excluding Nigeria would be pegged at 5.3% against 4.7% in 2015. This positive momentum
is linked to sustained growth in almost all Member States. Six of them, namely Burkina Faso
(5.2%), Cote d’Ivoire (8%), Mali (5.3%), Niger (5.2%), Senegal (6.6%) and Togo (5.3%) would have
sustained growth rates higher than 5%. Real GDP would grow positively in Cabo Verde (3.6%),
Guinea (3.8%), Liberia (2%) and Sierra Leone (4.3% following the sharp decline of -21.1% in 2015).

36.

However, although the impact of the economic recession in Nigeria is not yet felt beyond its
borders, the protracted economic downturn in the country could adversely affect other countries,
in particular Benin due to the close economic ties between the two countries.

1.3.2. Inflation
37.

ECOWAS annual average inflation rate, which was below 10% in the last decade and pegged at 8%
in 2015 would rise to 12.1% in 2016 (see table 6). This negative result could further undermine the
gains made in recent years with regard to the Community target of achieving a single-digit
inflation rate below 5% starting 2019.

The four-percentage point rise in inflation rate in the region in 2016 is partly attributable to the
sharp increase in commodities price index in Nigeria (15.4% against 9.0% in 2015). The direct and
indirect effects of the significant depreciation of the Naira, alongside higher electricity and fuel
prices, explain mainly the spike in inflation in the country (see table 7).

In addition, the protracted price hike in Ghana, which is expected to be at approximately 17% in
2016 just as the previous year (17.2%) and 15.5% in 2014, contributes to a situation of uncertainty
regarding the reduction and stabilisation of average inflation rate within ECOWAS. Beyond the
specific case of those two countries, which is arguably due to a slowdown in economic activity, it is
particularly interesting to note the heterogeneity of inflation dynamics between the two ECOWAS
monetary zones, namely UEMOA including Cabo Verde and WAMZ, as well as disparities between
countries of the latter zone.

Figure 5: Countries above the inflation threshold

Two strong trends can be identified. All UEMOA countries including Cabo Verde have price levels
that would be permanently pegged below the long-term 5% threshold (see figure 4). UEMOA’s
average inflation rate would be at 1.8% in 2016 against 1.2% in 2015. On the other hand, no
WAMZ country would have an inflation rate below the 5% threshold. WAMZ average inflation rate
would be at 14.2% in 2016 against 9.4% in 2015. It is, however, encouraging to note that almost all
countries within this second zone have inflation rates converging below the short-term 10%
threshold. Nigeria, in view of its current economic situation, alongside Ghana would arguably be
the only countries to miss out on this inflation convergence threshold in 2017 (see figure 5).
Nonetheless, persistent inflationary pressures in Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia call for vigilance .

Figure 6 : ECOWAS growth-to-inflation ratio

41.

On the whole, monitoring the trend in price index variation is of fundamental importance given its
impact on the population’s standard of living and economic growth. Figure 6 shows a negative but
significant relation (correlation coefficient of -0.70) between average inflation and real growth in
ECOWAS.

1.3.3. Budget deficit
42.

ECOWAS public finance generally deteriorated in recent years, threatening to undermine
macroeconomic management measures being implemented since 2000. The region’s average
deficit-to-GDP ratio would further deteriorate in 2016 to 4.5% from 4% in 2015, against an average
of 2.2% between 2012 and 2014 (see table 7 and figure 7). During the reporting period, only Cabo
Verde, The Gambia, Ghana, Senegal and Togo had public deficit ratio well above the Community’s
maximum threshold of 3 percent set out in the ECOWAS Multilateral Convergence Mechanism
(see table 7).

43.

By contrast, in 2015, only Burkina Faso (2.3%), Cote d’Ivoire (3.0%) and Mali (1.8%) recorded
deficit ratio below the threshold. The public finance of countries in the region is not expected to
improve in 2016, with the notable exception of Guinea and Guinea Bissau where the ratio is
expected to attain 1.9% and 2.1% against 8.8% and 7.1% respectively a year ago. On the other
hand, the positive result recorded by Mali and Cote d’Ivoire in 2015 would quickly result in a
negative situation in 2016 with ratios of 4.3% and 4% respectively.

In addition, the analysis of this ratio brings to the fore certain important developments, breaking
with current historic trend. They include:
- Rapid deterioration of the fiscal deficit in Benin which, before 2015 was one of the
model countries in fiscal discipline. The budget deficit ratio averaged barely 1%
between 2006 and 2014 before increasing sharply to 7.5% in 2015. The expected
level in 2016 is 4.2%;
- Consistent tight fiscal policy in Burkina Faso where the budget deficit ratio is
permanently pegged below the 3% threshold for at least a decade;
- Continued deterioration of budget deficit in The Gambia, which is expected to
reach 9.8% and even 12.9% in 2017 after a level of 6.5% in 2015 and 7.6%
between 2012 and 2014 ;
- Expected deterioration of the fiscal deficit in Liberia, with the ratio sharply rising
to 11.4% in 2015 and 7.1% in 2016 ;

- Lastly, deterioration of public finance in Nigeria, which is expected to reach 3.8%
in 2015 and 4.6% in 2016, a development breaking with the country’s previous
budgetary performance.

Figure 7: ECOWAS’ Public deficit

45.

Figure 9 : investment/growth

Figure 8: Expenditure/growth

Overall, the difficulties encountered in meeting the budget deficit threshold as set out in the
ECOWAS multilateral convergence mechanism is to a large extent linked to the significant role of
public expenditure as a source of growth. Indeed, there is a positive but significant relation
(correlation coefficient of 0.93) between government expenditure and ECOWAS economic growth
(figure 8). However, the positive impact of government expenditure depends on its allocation.
Public expenditure is more efficient when it is mainly allocated to investment whose positive
effect on economic growth is theoretically and empirically established. Thus, the positive but
highly significant relation (correlation coefficient of 0.94) in the case of ECOWAS confirms the role
of investment as a driver of growth (figure 9).

1.3.4. Public Debt
46.

ECOWAS public debt to GDP ratio remains broadly within the 70% threshold, the economically
sustainable limit for the region’s countries. However, there is a tendency for re-indebtness,
sometimes worrisome, which may erode the gains made under debt cancellation and relief
initiatives the region’s countries benefited from with the exception of Cabo Verde. Thus, ECOWAS
public debt ratio is expected to reach 24% in 2016 against 22% in 2015 and 18% on average over
the period from 2006 to 2014 (see table 9 and figure 10).

However, ECOWAS’ aggregated position hides significant disparities between countries. Cabo
Verde and The Gambia, with projected debt ratios of 119% and 99% respectively in 2016 remain
the only Member States whose debt stock would be largely pegged above the threshold set by the
Community. Similarly, the rate of debt accumulation in some countries portends a detrimental
cumulative situation. In particular, Ghana’s debt ratio rose sharply to 71% in 2015 with an
anticipated decline by 66% in 2016. Togo’s debt would also increase to 63% in 2016 against 62% in
2015. Senegal’s debt ratio would be pegged at 57% in 2015 and 2016.

Apart from the above cases, the debt situation in other countries is economically sustainable and
would be largely between 30% and 50% with the exception of Nigeria whose ratio is the lowest in
the region, and expected to be set at 15% in 2016 against 12% in 2015. The 3 percentage point
change is linked to the planned borrowing by government to deal with the economic recession
facing the country.
Figure 10 : Debt ratio of ECOWAS

49.

Figure 11: Growth/Debt Ratio

The analysis of ECOWAS data shows a negative but highly significant (correlation coefficient of 0.95) between public debt and economic growth (figure 11). This situation reflects the negative
impact of debt accumulation on economic performance.

1.3.5. Current account balance
50.

ECOWAS current account balance is expected to be at negative 2.2% in 2016, an improvement
from the sharp deterioration of 4.2% in 2015 (see table 10 and figure 12). These overall negative
results represent a drastic change in the ratio of the current account balance, from a historically
surplus position (3% between 2006 and 2014) to a deficit situation since 2015. This situation is
largely due to the sharp deterioration of Nigeria’s external position, a country traditionally with a
surplus account (see table 10). Thus, the sharp contraction of Nigeria’s export sector, following the
steep rise in oil prices, led the country from a comfortable surplus of current account balance (an
average of 6% between 2006 and 2014) into a deficit of 3% in 2015.

Despite, the expected rise in oil prices, especially following OPEC’s decision to reduce its oil
production with a view to prompting a rebound in prices, prices would remain below the record
levels reached between 2011 and 2014, due to a fragile global recovery. The expected rise in oil
prices would reduce Nigeria’s external deficit to about 1% in 2016 and 0% in 2017. Although there
is no critical threshold regarding this ratio in the ECOWAS multilateral convergence mechanism, an
uncontrolled deterioration, in particular beyond 5%, constitutes a major risk for the external
balance of countries. As shown in figure 13, the deterioration of the current account balance
negatively and significantly affects economic growth (correlation coefficient of 0.70).

Figure 12 : Trend in ECOWAS current account

Figure 13 : Growth-to-Current account balance ratio

52.

Aside Nigeria, Cote d’Ivoire and Guinea Bissau would be the only countries to maintain this ratio
below the economically sustainable limit. The ratio would be pegged at 2% in 2016 in those two
countries. Estimates of the ratio of current account balance for 2016 in Ghana (6%), Burkina Faso
(6%), Mali (6%) and to a lesser extent Cabo Verde (8%), Senegal (8%) and Togo (8%) show the
relative fragility of their external position. In contrast, the situation of these countries is far from
alarming, contrary to Liberia (30%), Sierra Leone (16%), The Gambia (13%), Guinea (13%), Benin
(10%) and Niger (18%). The situation of the last two countries, alongside UEMOA countries, could
to a certain extent be less problematic since the institutional arrangement for streamlining
external reserves is an automatic adjustment mechanism for negative shocks to their current
account balance. This arrangement within UEMOA provides a collective assurance against
asymmetric shocks and beyond, against the deterioration of the external position of countries.
However, the effectiveness of this mechanism calls for the mitigation of the moral hazard
associated with any shared system. Indeed, the assurance against external shocks provided to
UEMOA Member States should not encourage actions that are likely to cause instability of the
external account balance.

53.

On the whole, the difficult economic situation in Nigeria, arising from the fall in oil prices and
casting doubts on the region’s growth prospects, underpins the need for a structural
transformation of ECOWAS economies. Efforts made by ECOWAS Member States for accelerated
growth and development are always affected by some structural factors including poor
diversification and processing of primary commodities, due to overly rigid economic structures in
the region, as well as poor production capacity, particularly in the manufacturing sector.

54.

In this connection, countries in the region should expeditiously adopt appropriate measures to
adapt to low commodity prices, make their economies less vulnerable to shocks and develop new
sources of sustainable growth that will benefit all Community citizens. Improved agricultural

productivity will increase household income, especially in rural areas, reduce food prices and
develop the agro-processing industry in the region. Medium and long-term priorities should
revolve around measures that may transform economic structures in order to diversify the sources
of growth to make it more robust and resilient as well as create more jobs in all sectors of the
economy.
1.4

Review of Economic Performance and Reforms in ECOWAS Member States

Benin
55.

Following successful presidential elections in the country, a new President was sworn into office in
April 2016. The government found a difficult macroeconomic and treasury situation upon
assumption of office. While fiscal policy was generally sound in earlier years, the fiscal deficit
increased to around 8.5 percent of GDP in 2015, with continued spending overruns in the first
quarter of 2016. This widening fiscal deficit was financed by large bond issuances on the regional
financial market, adding significantly to future debt service. In order to deal with this challenge
the government initiated reforms to improve governance and the regulatory framework, in
particular for energy, to facilitate private sector investment.

56.

These efforts were directed not only at reducing the investment burden on the budget, but also
at facilitating the private-sector led growth necessary to create employment. The efforts also
included reforms to improve the efficiency of government spending, in particular, by addressing
severe weaknesses in audit, mobilize additional revenues and to develop the appropriate
regulatory framework for PPP which will be necessary to safeguard against future risks for the
budget. The government also started initiatives to improve the governance of state-owned
enterprises in support of a privatization agenda.

Burkina Faso
57.

The presidential and parliamentary elections in late 2015 ended a period marked by the 2014
popular uprising and the foiled military coup in September 2015. The political uncertainty took a
toll on economic activity, with GDP growth remaining at 4 percent in 2014 and 2015 (compared
with 6.4 percent in 2009-13). The January 2016 terrorist attack tendered to dampen the postelection rebound. However, growth was projected to increase to 5.2 percent in 2016 supported by
a broad-based recovery and the coming on stream of new gold mines. Quick implementation of a
supplementary budget law and a favourable agricultural campaign could support growth further.
In the medium term, growth is projected to recover gradually to historical averages (6-6.5
percent).

58.

The 2016 supplementary budget focuses on raising domestic revenue collection in order to rebuild
fiscal space for priority investments, in the context of a two percentage points of GDP decline in
tax revenue between 2013 and 2015. The revised budget targets an ambitious revenue increase of
about 1.5 percent of GDP relative to 2015, supported by new measures aimed at strengthening tax
and customs administration. The budget also incorporates new investments as well as a number of
new health, education and youth employment measures aimed at addressing pressing social
needs. Also, measures have been taken to contain the public wage bill and to accelerate the
preparation of their new National Plan for Economic and Social Development (PNDES).

Cabo Verde
59.

Cabo Verde’s economy is expected to resume a higher growth trajectory in 2016, driven mainly by
tourism, foreign direct investment and a recovery in domestic demand. While the impact of the
global financial crisis, and in particular the euro crisis, slowed growth markedly in 2012-15,

E P O R T

P a g e | 37

spillovers from these crises have now subsided. Rising external demand, in particular in the
tourism sector, a very strong FDI pipeline and the gradual recovery of private sector credit indicate
a marked acceleration of growth in 2016. Cabo Verde’s public debt relative to the size of the
economy has risen more than planned due to lower nominal growth since 2012 but remains in
comfortable position servicing the debt in view of the concessional nature of the bulk of the debt.
The authorities have taken measures to mitigate the risks associated with the high level of public
debt by containing public spending, in particular externally financed public investment, prioritizing
projects with the highest impact on growth and employment over the nearest term and delaying
others.
60.

The government continues to direct efforts at improving the performance of State-owned
enterprises (SOEs) which deliver essential infrastructure services to the economy. The introduction
of mandatory performance contracts in all of the six strategic SOEs has produced encouraging
results in most of them, improving their operational performance which remains critical to
restoring their financial health and reducing contingent fiscal liabilities

61.

In addition to raising public sector efficiency, Cabo Verde’s long-term growth depends on
bolstering productivity. Consequently, strong emphasis has been placed on reforms in that regard,
focusing on the business environment, labour market flexibility, access to financing, and education
and training to further reduce the skill mismatch. This would support job creation and inclusive
growth in tourism and related local businesses and economic diversification. A new labour code
which was expected to become effective in October 2016 will support this process, close the
gender gap—which is most pronounced for young and rural women—and help raise economic
growth

Côte d’Ivoire
62.

Economic performance has been impressive over the past four (4) years, buoyed by political
normalization, together with supportive fiscal policy and structural reforms to improve the
business climate. Solid macroeconomic performance continued in 2015 and the first quarter of
2016, driven by strong investment and private consumption, notwithstanding the adverse impact
of lower-than-expected rainfall on agriculture. Growth has been accompanied by a modest decline
in poverty, but other human development indicators have been slow to improve. Strong revenues,
an under execution of externally-financed capital spending and expenditures containment
measures helped limit the 2015 fiscal deficit and contributed to satisfactory budget execution in
the first quarter of 2016.

63.

The authorities recently adopted a National Development Plan (NDP) 2016 – 2020 that aims at
achieving sustained, strong and inclusive growth. Under the NDP, the private sector would play a
major role, supported by a continued expansion in public infrastructure and further structural
reforms to improve the business climate. Successful NDP implementation will depend on the pace
at which structural bottlenecks are tackled and productivity-enhancing reforms are carried out, as
well as on financing conditions and how domestic and external risks are addressed.

The Gambia
64.

The Gambian economy continued its recovery in the first half of 2016 supported by the rebound in
agriculture and tourism. Real GDP growth is forecast to pick up to around 5.0 percent in 2016 from
the 4.7 percent recorded in 2015. The country continued the implementation of its medium-term
development plan - the Programme for Accelerated Growth and Employment (PAGE) - which
elapses at end-2016 while a successor plan for 2017-2020 – the National Development Plan (NDP)
is being finalised.

Budget implementation in the first half of 2016 was quite challenging with tax receipts below
expectations coupled with spending pressures amidst the looming elections in December 2016. As
a result, government borrowing from the domestic money market picked up, putting upward
pressure on interest rates. The government continued its support to major State Owned
Enterprises (SOEs), particularly to the National Water and Electricity Company (NAWEC), The
Gambia Telecommunications Company Limited (GAMTEL) and The Gambia National Petroleum
Corporation (GNPC).

Ghana
66.

Faced with a challenging economic environment the authorities signed on the IMF’s ECFsupported programme whose implementation entered the third year in 2016. There has been
progress in stabilizing the macroeconomic situation and reducing financial imbalances, but fiscal
risks remain elevated. Consequently, the authorities are continuing their fiscal consolidation
programme and aim at strengthening policy and reform implementation. Further efforts are being
made to address revenue shortfalls and strengthen expenditure control measures to contain the
wage bill and other current spending. The government is running a primary surplus this year,
which, along with the stability of the cedi, should contribute to a marked decline in the debt-toGDP ratio.

67.

To ensure that the gains from fiscal consolidation are sustained over the medium term, measures
have been taken to effectively implement a wide range of ambitious reforms. These include
measures to broaden the tax base and enhance tax compliance, strengthen control of the wage
bill, and enhance public financial management (PFM). In this regard, the authorities recently
adopted a PFM legislation which is an improvement over previous laws. Steps have been taken to
address SOEs financial problems as a measure to reduce risks to the economy, the financial sector,
and the government budget from their underperformance. The central bank, Bank of Ghana,
continues to maintain a tight monetary stance to bring down inflation back to target. New
amendments were recent introduced into the Bank of Ghana Act to improve central bank
governance and reduce the scope for financing of government.

Guinea Bissau
68.

The political situation in Guinea Bissau has improved considerably. The government appointed in
June 2016 has made steadfast efforts to improve the management and transparency of public
finances through rigorous organization of weekly treasury committee meetings, and to implement
some key reforms. The government has declared the expensive bank bailout contracts (5.5
percent of GDP) null. As a precautionary measure, the bank bailout has been put on hold by the
regional court through an injunction until the courts rule on the validity of the bailout contracts.

69.

The fiscal situation in 2016 has been under severe strain, mainly owing to a loss of budget support
from development partners. To mitigate the situation and put the economy on track, the Council
of Ministers took a decision to sell part of seized wood to raise revenue for the government to
close the fiscal gap in 2016. Government’s economic programme currently being implemented
aims at consolidating the fiscal position through better expenditure management and enhanced
revenue mobilization, deepening institutional reforms, mitigating vulnerabilities, and developing
the private sector to support growth and job creation. The programme focuses on strengthening
budgetary transparency as well as public investment and debt management, improving the
compilation of statistics, and addressing governance and security reform issues.

Guinea
70.

Guinea’s economic performance over the past four years fell significantly short of the authorities’
projections. After a period of early gains (2012–13), the country was hit by the Ebola epidemic, a
sharp decline in commodity prices, and political uncertainty. The economy is recovering from the
effects of the Ebola epidemic. Growth is projected to rebound to 3.7 percent in 2016 on the back
of higher electricity provision from the Kaleta hydroelectric dam and a strong increase in bauxite
production. Inflation rose to 7.9 percent in April 2016, driven by stronger domestic demand and a
weaker exchange rate. Bank credit to the private sector continued to grow at rapid rates, and
reserve buffers increased and stabilized at 2.4 months of imports, after significant losses in 2014–
15.

71.

The medium-term outlook is favourable but continues to be clouded by downside risks. Growth is
projected to average 4.5 percent over the next five years, and inflation would decline gradually to
5 percent by 2019. The basic fiscal balance is projected to remain around 0.5 percent of GDP,
reflecting financing constraints and prudent policies to strengthen reserves. The authorities’
economic strategy for 2016–22, under preparation, aims at unlocking broad-based and inclusive
growth, driven by investments in electricity, roads, and agriculture. The private sector would also
play a role through new mining projects, new transformation units of agricultural products, and
large residential housing projects and administrative buildings through PPPs.

Liberia
72.

The Ebola epidemic and the fall in commodity prices revealed the vulnerabilities of Liberia’s
economy. After barely positive growth in 2014, GDP was flat in 2015 mainly due to the decline in
activity in the iron ore and rubber sectors. The current account deficit deteriorated, reflecting
weaker export receipts and the Ebola-related surge in imports. Lower revenue from the natural
resource sectors and higher Ebola-related spending, largely financed by donor support, pushed the
FY2015 overall government deficit to 8.4 percent of GDP. The FY2016 deficit is estimated to have
declined to 7 percent of GDP as continued revenue weakness forced the government to contain
spending.

73.

The economy is expected to experience recovery in 2016, with growth rising to 2.5 percent, on
account of a rebound in services and the start of gold production, while inflation should stay in the
single digits. The overall government deficit is projected to remain broadly constant, owing to
strong fiscal measures to address lower natural resource revenues, declining external budget
support, the cost of the 2017 elections, and the take-over of security from UNMIL. Over the
medium term, economic growth is expected to increase to 5.5 percent on average, due to a
recovery in mining, improvement in infrastructure, particularly energy and roads, and higher
agricultural productivity. The fiscal position is expected to improve on account of the authorities’
commitment to improve domestic revenue mobilization and contain spending.

Mali
74.

Mali’s economy continues to grow at a strong pace, supported both by public capital spending and
the regional central bank’s (BCEAO) accommodative policy. Inflation is falling and is projected to
decline to 0.5 percent by end-December. Structural reform programmes being implemented
continue to advance in most areas. The 2016 fiscal programme provided for a temporary loosening
of the fiscal stance to accommodate higher public investment and peace-related and security
needs. Although public investment increased in the first half of the year, the fiscal deficit was
below target. While progress on tax administration and public financial management (PFM)
reforms has continued, the implementation of reforms to foster good governance has been slower
than envisaged, particularly regarding legislation to combat corruption and unlawful enrichment.

Structural reforms being undertaken by the government include measures to support revenue
mobilization and strengthen PFM and governance, as well as other measures to support
sustainable long-run economic growth and poverty reduction. Efforts to address financial sector
weaknesses are ongoing. Priorities include strengthening the balance sheet of the restructured
housing bank, reforming the microfinance sector, and further modernizing the framework for antimoney laundering and combating the financing of terrorism.

Niger
76.

Despite security concerns, commodity price shocks, and the regional economic slowdown, Niger’s
economy continues to grow, albeit at a slower pace. The decline reflects slower activity in the
agricultural and natural resource sectors. Inflation remains subdued, partly reflecting a good
harvest and the stabilizing role played by government food programmes.

77.

Budgetary revenues from non-resource sources have increased significantly, but shortfalls in
resource revenue and external financing, coupled with a surge in capital spending, led to slippages
in meeting fiscal targets and accumulation of domestic expenditure arrears during 2015. Overruns
in spending also reflect budget execution weaknesses, including a lack of effective oversight over
the expenditure chain. To preserve fiscal sustainability and limit the incurrence of new arrears, the
government has adopted a number of measures to reinforce revenue mobilization and improve
expenditure control to ensure that spending commitments are in line with available resources.

Nigeria
78.

The Nigerian economy is facing substantial challenges. While the non-oil sector accounts for
90 percent of GDP, the oil sector plays a central role in the economy. Lower oil prices have
significantly affected the fiscal and external accounts, decimating government revenues to just 7.8
percent of GDP and resulting in the doubling of the general government deficit to about
3.7 percent of GDP in 2015. Exchange restrictions introduced by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN)
to protect reserves have impacted significantly on segments of the private sector that depend on
an adequate supply of foreign currencies. Coupled with fuel shortages in the first half of the year
and lower investor confidence, growth slowed sharply from 6.3 percent in 2014 to an estimated
2.7 percent in 2015. The authorities formally announced the economy falling into a recession in
the second half of 2016.

79.

Recovery in economic activity is expected to be modest in the medium term given the uncertain
global outlook and the likelihood of oil prices remaining low. The authorities have recognized the
need for significant macroeconomic adjustment to move and put the economy back on track. This
entails, among others, implementation of a coherent package of policies to safeguard fiscal
sustainability and reduce external imbalances as well as advancing structural reforms to support
inclusive growth.

Senegal
80.

The economy of Senegal has witnessed strong macroeconomic performance in recent years, with
growth increasing from 4.3 percent in 2014 to 6.5 percent in 2015 and 2016. Inflation remains low,
and a fiscal deficit target of 4.2 percent of GDP has been planned for 2016. Recognising that
raising growth rates to 7 to 8 percent over the 20-year period of the Plan Sénégal Emergent
requires steadfast action to reduce patronage and rent-seeking so as to open economic space to
small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and foreign direct investment (FDI), the authorities have
cancelled Senegal Airlines’ flying rights, closed five public agencies with no formal existence, taken
steps to improve the business environment, promoted agricultural development, and reformed
university scholarships. In addition, energy subsidies were eliminated in the 2016 budget as part of

reforms to boost electricity generation and lower costs. These reforms signal improving economic
governance while positively impacting public finances.
81.

With strong sustainable and inclusive growth in mind, efforts have been made to rebalance
public expenditure towards investment in human capital and public infrastructure, accelerate
efforts to curtail tax expenditures, and strengthen the efficiency of public expenditure by
controlling subsidies and the wage bill.

Sierra Leone
82.

Sierra Leone’s economic reforms over the last three years have been largely successful. The
economy proved resilient in the face of two major exogenous shocks: the Ebola epidemic and
collapse of iron ore prices and associated loss of production in 2014-2015. Sound macroeconomic
policies, together with generous support from development partners helped ensure fiscal and
external sustainability, while providing sufficient resources to begin implementing the post-Ebola
Recovery Strategy. Since the last quarter of 2015, economic growth has resumed, and it remains
on an upward trend, supported by new investments in mining, agriculture and fisheries. The
recovery underway is projected to remain sustainable over the medium term.

83.

Implementation of structural reform programmes have contributed to improvement in the
transmission of economic policies. Reforms of revenue mobilization and administration,
expenditure control and public finance management have contributed to fiscal sustainability,
while providing a framework for transparency and accountability in the use of public resources.
Reforms of the monetary policy operating framework have been instrumental to proactive
monetary policy.

Togo
84.

Economic growth has remained strong in recent years, averaging 5.4 percent in 2013-14, on the
back of productivity gains in the agricultural sector and public investment in transport
infrastructure. The fast pace of public investment has laid the basis for higher growth but has also
contributed to a pronounced increase in public debt and current account deficit. Output growth is
expected to be sustained over the medium term, although current account and debt pressures are
unlikely to abate. Growth is expected to average 5.5 percent in 2015–18, supported by
agricultural production, transportation services linked to international trade, and the impact of
investments in transport infrastructure, which should facilitate private economic activity.

85.

The authorities have underscored the need to place fiscal balance on a sustainable path to ensure
debt and external sustainability and create space for social spending. They advised anchoring
public finances on a domestic primary balance to reduce the public debt-to-GDP ratio over the
medium term. In this regard, emphasize has been placed on control of recurrent spending,
including reduction of fuel subsidies, raising the efficiency of public investment, enhancing public
financial and debt management and accelerating implementation of key fiscal reforms, including
the reorganization of the Ministry of Finance, developing an effective treasury cash management,
establishing a treasury single account, and modernizing revenue administration

1.5 Global Commodity Prices
86.

Commodities, raw or partially processed, are often the most significant exports of developing
countries, and sometimes the single most important source of government revenue. Prior to
2014, international commodity prices have generally been high and increasing, but started
experiencing downward trends from 2014(see fig 3). Below are highlights of price developments of

some major commodities most of which have direct consequence on the economies of ECOWAS
Member States.
87.

Crude oil: The annual average price of a barrel of crude oil has been persistently low since the
beginning of the year and is expected to further decline by 15.4 percent in 2016 to an average
price of $42.96 per barrel, from $50.55 in 2015. The current decrease is lower when compared to
the -47.3 percent decline between 2013 and 2014. Since 2011 the price of crude oil has been
estimated to have declined by about 59.1 percent. The further plunge in price is driven by the
additional from mainly from Canada, Iran and Saudi Arabia.

88.

. Natural Gas: Natural gas price jumped from US$2.61/mmbtu2 in 2015 to an average of
US$4.31/mmbtu in 2016, representing an increase of about 64.8 percent. However, the price of
the commodity declined by 40.2 percent in 2015. The price hike in 2016 is due to an excess of
global demand over supply, and therefore less stock build-up, especially in US and Japan.

89.

Coal: The average price of a metric ton (mt) of coal is expected to cap at US$63.3 in 2016
compared to US$57.04 in 2015, which is about 11.0 percent increase, on account of modest
increase in global demand and
restricted production in China due mainly to government
regulation of the environment and adverse weather conditions in the coal producing areas.

90.

Rubber: The average price of rubber per metric ton is expected to increase by 0.1 percent in 2016
compared to a decline of 20.3 percent in 2015. This unimpressive price increase is attributed to
currency volatility of the three (3) main producers; Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand.

91.

Cocoa: The global average price of cocoa is expected to decline by 0.6 percent in 2016 compared
to an increase of 2.4 percent in 2015. This reflects expectations of a significant surplus in the
2016/2017 crop season. West African production will recover from many noneconomic factors and
the Latin American production will equally expand.

92.

Cotton: The average world price of a kilogram of cotton is expected to improve by 5.4 percent in
2016 compared to a decline of 15.3 percent in 2015. In other words, a kilogram of cotton was
traded at an average of US$1.64 in 2016 compared to $1. 55 in 2015.

93.

Sugar: The average world price of sugar is expected to decline further in 2016 by 39.8 percent.
The decline could be explained by the good harvest in Brazil, the world’s largest producer and
exporter of sugar.

94.

Wheat: For four years in a row the average world price of wheat has declined and in 2016 it is
expected to decline further to $148.68 per metric ton from $206.38 per metric ton in 2015,
representing a decline of about 28.0%. In 2014, the average global price fell by 8.76 % compared
to 0.32 % in 2013. On average, the world price per metric ton in 2014 was estimated at US$ 284.9
compared to US$ 312.25 in 2013.
Figure 16 : Price of Rice/Wheat/Sugar

95.

Rice: The world price of a metric ton of rice appreciated this year by about 7.9 percent after
successive declines since 2013. On average, the price of rice rose to $416.45 per metric ton in
2016, from US$386.0 in 2015.

Gold: The price of gold rose to US$1,259.18 per ounce in 2016 compared to US$1,160.66 in 2015,
representing an 8.5 percent rise. The surge in price is due to strong additional demand, in
response to the US Federal Reserve delays of an expected increase in interest rate.
Figure 17: Price of Iron Ore/Gold/Uranium

97.

Iron Ore: The average price of iron ore declined by 3.4 percent in 2016, compared to a decline of
42.4 percent in 2015. In other words, price decreased to US$53.94/mt in 2016 from US$55.83/MT
in 2015. The slow down in price is a result of China’s transition to a consumption driven economy,
together with other reforms and environmental concerns.

98.

Platinum: The average price is expected to decline this year due mainly to surplus in many
markets. The global price will be lower than that of last year by 4.05 percent, a decline from
US$1,161 per pound in 2015 to US$1,114 per pound in 2016.

CHAPTER II: IMPLEMENTATION OF THE COMMUNITY WORK PROGRAMME
2.1

Harmonization of macroeconomic policies and private sector promotion

2.1.1 Multilateral Surveillance
99.

Multilateral surveillance of economic and financial policies of ECOWAS Member States constitutes
the basis for the implementation of the ECOWAS monetary and integration programme and the
realisation of the ECOWAS Single Currency Initiative. It is principally achieved through the
monitoring and evaluation of the status of macroeconomic convergence in the Member States and
the effective implementation of the roadmap for the ECOWAS Single Currency Programme. The
implementation of multilateral surveillance activities contributes to deepening monetary and
economic integration and facilitating progress towards macroeconomic convergence. The key
activities implemented in this domain during the review period relate to the ECOWAS Multilateral
Surveillance Mechanism; strengthening coordination and cooperation with key development
partners; production of ECOWAS Annual and Interim Reports; the Roadmap for the ECOWAS
Single Currency Programme; and facilitation institutional convergence between ECOWAS and
UEMOA Commissions.
 Implementation of the ECOWAS Multilateral Surveillance Mechanism

100. Key achievements and outputs realised in the implementation of the programme were as follows:
101. The Joint ECOWAS Commission, the West African Monetary Agency (WAMA) and the West
African Monetary Institute (WAMI) surveillance missions: During the reviewed period, the
Commission, in collaboration with the West African Monetary Agency (WAMA) and the West
African Monetary Institute (WAMI), organised two Joint Multilateral Surveillance missions to
ECOWAS Member States in April and September 2016. The Member States visited concurrently
were The Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria and Sierra Leone Burkina Faso, Cape Verde and
Senegal. The Joint Multilateral Surveillance Missions enabled the evaluation of the performance of
the economies and status of macroeconomic convergence in ECOWAS Member States in 2015
and the first half of 2016 and held dialogue on policy harmonisation measures with key
stakeholders involved in economic and financial management. The key findings from the joint
surveillance missions provided the basis for the preparation of the ECOWAS Macroeconomic
Convergence Report for 2015.
102. Strengthening the Effective Operations of the Institutional Organs of the ECOWAS Multilateral
Surveillance Mechanism: Activities undertaken in 2016 included the disbursement of ECOWAS
annual subvention of US$50,000 to each of the National Coordinating Committees (NCC) in the
Member States to support their operations and payment of salaries of the macroeconomists and
bilingual secretaries working in the NCC secretariats. The Commission also organised the technical
meeting of the ECOWAS Joint Secretariat of regional institutions involved in the ECOWAS
Multilateral Surveillance Mechanism in Abuja from 11 to 13 July followed by the regional meeting
of the National Coordinating Committees (NCCs) in Ouagadougou from 18 to 22 July 2016. The
meetings reviewed the Country economic reports of the NCCs and discussed the status of
macroeconomic stability and convergence in the ECOWAS Member States in 2015. The NCC
meeting in Ouagadougou also discussed the status of implementation of the ECOMAC database
and measures needed to facilitate the timely and regular online updating of the ECOMAC
database in the Member States. The report of the meeting provided critical inputs into the
production and publication of the ECOWAS Macroeconomic Convergence for 2015. The
Convergence report assessed the status of macroeconomic stability and convergence in the
ECOWAS Commission

ECOWAS Member States in 2015 and provided concrete recommendations for enhancing the
performance of Member States in achieving macroeconomic stability and convergence on a
sustainable basis.
103. The Commission has also undertaken preparatory activities for the organisation of the statutory
meeting of the ECOWAS Convergence Council in early December 2016 in Abuja. The meeting is
expected to review and adopt the ECOWAS Convergence Report for 2015 and assess the status of
implementation of the roadmap for the ECOWAS Single Currency Programme and progress made
towards the realization of the single currency in the region by 2020. The report of the
Convergence Council will be tabled before the next meeting of the Presidential Task Force
scheduled to hold in Abuja in the first quarter of 2017.
104. Cooperation with IMF AFRITAC West 2: The Commission organised a video conference with the
IMF AFRITAC West 2 based in Accra on 18 March 2016 in Abuja to identify concrete areas of
cooperation and collaboration in the implementation of multilateral surveillance activities and in
the development of regional statistics. The conference ended with a commitment by the two
institutions to the signing of a memorandum of understanding (MoU) that will provide the
framework for capacity strengthening and implementation of joint activities in multilateral
surveillance activities. The Commission also participated in the Steering Committee meeting of the
IMF-AFRITAC West 2 in Banjul in May 2016 to review the operations of AFRITAC West 2 in 2015.
 Studies and Institutional Coordination
105. The activities executed under the programme contributed to strengthening capacity in the
production and publication of ECOWAS Interim and Annual Reports, enhancing cooperation and
collaboration with key development partners and international development and financial
organisations such as the World Bank, International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the African
Development Bank (AfDB).
106. During the period under review, the Commission participated in the 2016 Spring and Annual
Meetings of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in Washington D.C. in
April 2016 and October 2016 respectively. The Commission’s delegation to the meetings held wide

on Finance, Monetary Affairs, Economic Planning and Integration and the Economic Commission
for Africa (ECA) Conference of African Ministers of Finance, Planning and Economic Development
held in Addis Ababa from 31 March to 5 April 2016. The theme of the conference was “Towards an
Integrated and Coherent Approach to Implementation, Monitoring and Evaluation of Agenda 2063
and the SDGs”.
 Implementation of the Roadmap for the ECOWAS Single Currency Programme
108. The implementation of activities under the programme facilitated the robust monitoring and
evaluation of progress made towards the realisation of the ECOWAS single currency by 2020. The
following activities were carried out during the period under review:

Development Bank (AfDB), to solicit for funding and support for payment of the subscription of
ECOWAS Countries to the membership of ATI.
123. This project, highly anticipated by financial institutions, is intended to facilitate the financing of
major public and private projects and provide covers for commercial and political risks for
investors in the region. After the adoption of this programme by the Council of Ministers in
December 2013, the Commission continued work with the Project Implementation Committee
(PIC) and the African Trade Insurance Agency for the operationalization of the programme.

pursue Tissue Culture (SHEEL BIOTECH Ltd) development and Agro-Business Farms (GALOP TRADE
Ltd – Pulses, Pickles, etc) investment.
- Implementation of ECOWAS-US Projects
130. The US has of late shown heightened interest in forging closer relations with the ECOWAS
Commission. The US private sector? led by the US Chamber of Commerce signed a Memorandum
of Understanding with the ECOWAS Commission in October 2015. As part of the implementation
of the MOU, the US Chamber paid a visit to the Commission in February 2016 and expressed
interest to take part in the implementation of ECOWAS projects. To facilitate the process, the
Commission set up a project bank which was presented to the US Chamber of Commerce during
a return visit on the sidelines of the AGOA Forum held in August 2016.
131. The Commission also collaborated with USA Chambers of Commerce including Microsoft, John
Deere (Agric Machines manufacturers), etc to organize and execute a business mission to Nigeria
(ICT, Agric and Finance) and ECOWAS Commission on 17th March, 2016 to promote business
partnerships, investment and general support to the functioning of regional business groups.
 Engagements with the Gulf Cooperation Council Countries (GCC)
132. The Commission initiated engagements with the United Arab Emirates (UAE) with a view to signing
cooperation agreement frameworks with the Member States of the Gulf Cooperation Council
(GCC). As a result, the Director General of the Annual Investment Meeting (AIM), an annual
investment promotion event organized by the Ministry of Economy of Dubai visited the
Commission. The Minister of Economy of Dubai is expected to visit the Commission in January
2017 to hold discussions with the President of the Commission on cooperation between Dubai and
ECOWAS Commission.
 Cooperation with The Islamic Development Bank (IsDB)
133. Following discussions with officials of the Islamic Development Bank’s regional office in Dakar, the
IsDB and the ECOWAS Commission have expressed the need for the two institutions to strengthen
their cooperation in the funding and implementation of regional integration projects.
Consequently, a Memorandum of Understanding has been prepared as a cooperation framework
document and is expected to be finalised and signed before the end of the year
2.1.3 Research and Statistics
134. The major research and statistics activities carried out by the Commission are divided into the
following areas: (i) Research and Development, (ii) Economic and Social analysis, (iii) Coordination
and Harmonisation of Research Methods (iv) Data Management and Statistical Publications.
135. As part of its research and development, the Commission is in the process of finalising the
Regional Economic Research Programme (RERP 2017-2021). Following the recommendations of
major national stakeholders in the economic research sector, the draft programme paper will be

of economic research, presently underway in the 15 Member States, should lead to the finalisation
of the 2017-2021 RERP in the first quarter of 2017.
136. Furthermore, a fiscal transition study will be carried out in ECOWAS Member States, within the
framework of research publications. A concept note on the study was prepared and the goal is to
open substantive debate on fiscal transition and consequently, its effect on economic balances, at
a time when ECOWAS is taking giant steps in trade liberalisation with the signing of the EPA.
137. Economic and social analysis activities involved the preparation of a preliminary report on
developments in poverty reduction strategies in countries, in collaboration with the UEMOA
Commission. The report should enhance the regional strategy complementing socio-economic
development efforts in countries. This is in response to the need to adapt the regional strategy to
ongoing changes in Member States in development strategy and the fight against poverty. The
validation meeting by Member States will be held in December 2016.
138. Regarding coordination and harmonisation of statistical methods for public finance statistics, the
Regional Action Plan for the harmonisation of public finance statistics within ECOWAS (PASFP
2016-2020), validated by national experts, was updated. The draft methodology guide on
preparation of the Table of Government Financial Operations for ECOWAS Member States
(ECOWAS TOGF) is being developed. The pre-validation meeting by the specialised TOGF technical
group will be held in November 2016 while the compilation model for ECOWAS regional TOGF is
being developed and will be finalised by the end of the year.
139. For national accounts, the draft regional Action Plan for the implementation of the National
Accounting System (NAC 2008) within ECOWAS (2016 – 2020 PARSCN) was updated and is being
implemented.
140. Concerning prices, the operationalisation of the roadmap for the methodology guide on
compilation of the Harmonised Consumer Price Index (HCPI) within ECOWAS, which was validated
by Member States, is ongoing with the financial support of GIZ. Thus, in the first quarter 2016,
technical assistance missions were deployed in Guinea, The Gambia and Sierra Leone. In Guinea,
the product list, based on the most recent household spending survey, was updated in
collaboration with officers of the country’s National Statistics Institute Price Division.
Subsequently, the IPC list was re-classified based on the 12 COICOP functions, to promote
comparability with other ECOWAS Member States. In Sierra Leone, capacity building was provided
for Price Officers of the Statistics Institute and there was a fundamental change in their IPC for the
most recent period. In The Gambia, capacity building was also provided for Price Officers of the
country’s Statistics Institute, with the support of Experts from Ghana.
141. In the area of Balance of Payments and the International Investment Position (BOP_IIP), the
planning paper on activities for the operationalisation of the action plan on compilation of
ECOWAS regional external accounts was jointly prepared with WAMI. The terms of reference for
the development of a software application specific to BOP preparation in ECOWAS countries have
been finalised and will be submitted to GIZ for funding. The two draft Regulations, one on the
establishment of a Regional Committee for Reconciliation of intra-Community data on external
trade and the other on the creation of the Regional Committee on ECOWAS BOP and IIP statistics
will be submitted to the Council of Ministers in the first quarter 2017.
142. On developments in international merchandise trade (IMT), the process is underway to
implement the Single Guide for the compilation of ECOWAS external trade statistics, validated by
experts and Directors General of National Statistics Institutes. The Commission financed the
participation of four Member States in the session of the United Nations Statistical Commission in
March 2016 and continues to work closely with the UN Statistics Division which provided support

for a capacity building meeting on environment statistics for Member States. AfDB funding for
capacity building on production of IMT statistics is being finalised and will be submitted to
Member State experts for validation in the first quarter 2017.
143. For data management and statistical publications, visits to monitor implementation of the
Economic, Financial, Monetary and Social database “ECOBASE”, adopted in 2013, were carried out
to Guinea, Gambia, Guinea Bissau and Liberia. Data was gathered on these countries for the 2000
– 2015 period and forecasts were made for 2016 and 2017. The metadata obtained from
producers should lead, after processing, to more comparable data. Also, capacity building
activities involved the provision of training on ECOBASE functioning and use to the technical group
comprising focal points from the aforementioned countries and their deputies, in addition to
management methods training. The training will enable the group to regularly update regional
databases (ECOWAS ECOMAC, NUEMOA BDSM, etc.) Efforts are underway to set up an efficient
online integrated management system for ECOBASE.
144. The joint tool (EUROTRACE package) for compilation and processing of statistics on international
trade in goods is undergoing migration from Access to SQL. The major challenge presently being
experienced is the acquisition of IT equipment with which to configure SQL/ORACLE for all
Member States, in order to better secure external trade databases. A workshop on assessing the
migration of databases to the Eurotrace SQL Server, bringing together all Experts from Member
States, will be held in the last quarter of 2016. Concerning questionnaires to collect sectoral data
for publication in ECOWAS bulletins in 2015, the consolidated data is being prepared.
145. For statistical publications, a paper on the 2016 and 2017 economic outlook of ECOWAS was
prepared. Resources and funds from current GDP and real GDP from ECOBASE were updated for
all countries for the 1990 – 2015 period. Data is currently being processed for other
macroeconomic accounts for the same period.
146. To prepare the 2015 ECOWAS Statistical Directory, compilation models for regional GDP and
regional TOGF were designed and set up while those for public debt, BOP and currencies are
underway.
147. The draft documents being prepared for 2016 are: (i) analysis of ECOWAS external trade, (ii) paper
on ECOWAS national accounts, (iii) statistical bulletin and paper on ECOWAS socio-economic
indicators.
2.1.4 Community Development Programme (CDP)
148. At its 45th session in July 2014 at Accra, Ghana, the Conference of Heads of State and Government
adopted the Community Development Programme (CDP) and directed the ECOWAS Commission
to take all necessary measures to finance the programme. Thus, in the period under review, the
following activities were carried out by the Commission with a view to organising a donors’
roundtable to finance CDP projects.
149. The Commission organised a technical meeting of the Resource Mobilisation Committee for CDP
financing in Abidjan, Cote d’Ivoire, from 3 to 5 May 2016. This led to the validation of the third
study on the contribution of Public Private Partnerships (PPP) to the financing of regional projects
and the relaunch of preparations for the CDP Roundtable. At the end of the meeting, the major
recommendations bordered on the following, among others:
-

officially contact the Cote d’Ivoire President and Chair of the ECOWAS Authority of Heads
of State and Government to fix specific dates for the two events,

conduct in-depth analysis of the 106 CDP projects eligible for public private partnerships
and select the projects with high maturity levels likely to attract the targeted private
investors,
finalise the Memorandum of Understanding between ECOWAS and AfDB to facilitate
AfDB support for the Roundtable on the financing of CDP priority projects.

150. At its 49th session in Dakar, Senegal in June 2016, the Authority decided that a roundtable on CDP
financing will be held before the end of 2016 in Abidjan, Cote d’Ivoire. In that regard, the President
of the ECOWAS Commission led a mission to the Ivorian authorities, hosts of the event and the
African Bank for Development (AfDB) on 20 and 21 June 2016. At the end of the mission, the
ECOWAS Commission and the Ivorian authorities agreed to postpone the roundtable to the end of
March 2017 due to some of the country’s scheduling constraints (elections, etc.) and to enable the
Commission work closely with AfDB for the success of the event. Moreover, the African
Development Bank gave its consent to support ECOWAS Commission and EBID as the lead donor,
for the preparation of the technical dossiers for projects and mobilisation of partners and private
investors.
151. Seven regional priority projects have been selected to be presented for funding at the roundtable
scheduled to hold in March 2017. They are: (1) the three-lane dual carriage Lagos-Dakar highway
(in two phases, the 1,028 km long Abidjan-Lagos section and the 3,000km long Abidjan-Dakar
section), (2) Cotonou-Niamey-Ouaga-Dori-Abidjan railway loop and the Ouangolodougou –
Bamako railway section, (3) creation of a sea transport comp-any “Sealink”, (4) interconnection of
225kV and 330kV electric power grids in West Africa (Nigeria-Niger-Benin-Burkina; Ghana-Burkina
Faso-Mali-Guinea), (5) solar and wind power plants in ECOWAS Member States, (6)
implementation of the Regional Offensive for Sustainable Rice Production in West Africa (with a
component on boreholes for agricultural and food use), and (7) construction of 6 specialised
referral hospitals and an ECOWAS Centre for disease control (ECOWAS CRSCM). These are highly
strategic regional projects expected to yield considerable benefit for regional integration. The total
cost of the seven projects is estimated at US$12.45 billion and the chosen mode of financing is
through Public Private Partnerships (PPP).
152. An inter-departmental technical committee was set up within ECOWAS to coordinate and
implement all necessary activities for the conduct of the roundtable on CDP financing. Moreover, a
communication plan was prepared and a website created to ensure visibility for the event.
153. At the second ECOWAS-JICA-UEMOA meeting which was held in Abidjan, Cote d’Ivoire on 27 and
28 July 2016, the status of the draft Masterplan on the development of the West Africa growth
ring and the Abidjan-Lagos highway project was presented. The meeting recommended that the
outcome of the study on the draft Masterplan for the logistic chains development for the West
Africa Growth Ring be capitalised upon in the feasibility study for the Abidjan – Lagos highway
project.
154. In continuing collaboration with the African Bank for Development (AfDB), a joint technical
working group comprising ECOWAS and AfDB was set up in July 2016 which met several times to
consider the maturity of projects and their potential mode of funding. The working group will also
schedule and organize all practical aspects of the roundtable. Regarding the flagship project on the
Abidjan-Lagos corridor, the AfDB Board on 21 September 2016, approved funds for a feasibility
study and detailed work plan estimated at US$15.6 million. It is expected that AfDB will send
notification for the selection of firms for the study. Furthermore, a meeting of infrastructure
experts and ministers will be held in November 2016, to relaunch the Steering Committee of the
Abidjan – Lagos corridor comprising Cote d’Ivoire, Ghana, Togo, Benin and Nigeria.

155. The World Bank also provided support for the roundtable through its regional office in Abuja,
Nigeria. A series of video conferences were held with the technical departments of the World Bank
in Washington and the sub-region on 20 and 21 September 2016. These meetings discussed the
eligibility of the seven priority projects to be financed through PPP, as well as the institutional
arrangements and financial structuring of each project. A team, led by the ECOWAS Commission
President, took part in a meeting on CDP with the Directors of Operations, World Bank Vice
President Africa region, Mr Makhtar Diop and ECOWAS ambassadors, in the margins of the IMFWorld Bank annual assembly. It was suggested that projects with sufficiently high maturity levels
(feasibility study, APD, etc. available) should be emphasised and accorded priority. At the end of
the meeting, Dr Albert G. Zeufack, Chief Economist Africa region, was selected to lead the
discussions with ECOWAS. In addition, the Commission requested that the Bank field a technical
team to the ECOWAS Commission in Abuja, to assist in structuring the different projects into PPP,
with a view to obtaining the involvement of regional and international private investors for the
donor roundtable in March 2017.
156. As part of cooperation with the Islamic Development Bank (ISDB), a delegation led by the ECOWAS
Commission President met with the ISDB President, Dr Banda Al-Hajjar in the margins of the IMF –
World Bank annual assembly, to discuss ISDB support for the roundtable on CDP financing. The
ISDB also expressed interest to support the Commission in enhancing intra-regional trade,
increasing energy supply and combating food insecurity and pandemics. A Memorandum of
Understanding (MoU) is being prepared and will be signed in November 2016 in Jeddah, Saudi
Arabia, to consolidate the cooperation between the two institutions.
157. To sensitise development partners and the private sector on funding for priority projects,
Commission held several meetings with investors from China and the region:
- the Commission, in a video conference on 23 September 2016 with the China - Africa
Development Bank, raised awareness on the seven ECOWAS priority projects and the
donor roundtable. At the end of the meeting, it was agreed that further information will
be gathered from the Chinese company which had undertaken a technical visit on the
Lagos – Dakar highway. The Chinese Bank promised to sensitise companies in China on
the Sealink and Rice Offensive projects and the construction of solar plants in Burkina
Faso and Mali.
-

ECOWAS Commission also met with the Chinese group “China Gezhouba Group
Corporation (CGGC)” on 21 October 2016 in Abuja, Nigeria, within the framework of
mobilizing funding for CDP projects. The meeting explored the possibility of collaboration
between the ECOWAS Commission and the CGGC Group, particularly on the structuring
and financing of CDP priority energy projects.

-

Similarly, the Commission met with the OSPREY Investments Group on 21 October 2016
in Abuja, on the implementation of the priority development project – the Abidjan –
Lagos highway.

-

A meeting was held in Abuja, Nigeria on 27 October 2016, between the ECOWAS
Commission and the company SIJ Global/GSR-MBH. The company specializes in the
financing and construction of renewable energy projects (solar, wind power, radiant
energy).

158. As part of efforts to prepare the priority projects for the roundtable, a meeting of ECOWAS
maritime transport ministers was held in Lome, Togo, on 17 October 2016. The meeting created
awareness among Member States and obtained political support for the proposal to grant the
SEALINK project Community company status within ECOWAS. The Ministers endorsed the creation
of the ECOWAS Transnational Sea Transport Company and made the following recommendations:

organise a joint ECOWAS - FEWACCI tour to inform and sensitise potential investors and
political decision-makers in all ECOWAS Member States,
define the formula for allocating responsibilities, in collaboration with FEWACCI and EBID,
taking into account the recommendations of the Protocol on the creation of Community
companies,
leave the decision on location of the SEALINK headquarters to the discretion of the
Authority of Heads of State and Government,
grant observer status to the Kingdom of Morocco on the SEALINK project with a view to
facilitating the extension of the project to North Africa and promoting the mobilisation of
Moroccan investors for the project.

159. It is envisaged that a series of activities and meetings will be held up till December 2016, to
consolidate the technical and financial support of partners for the successful organisation of the
donor roundtable on financing the region’s priority projects, expected to hold in Abidjan, Cote
d’Ivoire in March 2017.
2.1.5 ECOWAS Sahel Strategy
160. The ECOWAS Commission launched the development of a strategy for the Sahel region based on
the decision of the Authority of Heads of State and Government held in Abuja, Nigeria on 17 and
18 July 2014. The ECOWAS Sahel Strategy aims at providing a regional response to the long-term
development and stability challenges of Sahel-Saharan areas.
161. In the period under review, the Commission consolidated its cooperation with other partners of
the Sahel Strategy in the region, particularly G5 Sahel, Sahel Mission (MISAHEL) of the African
Union. The Commission is expected to hold political dialogue with Mauritania and Chad to
strengthen cooperation with G5 Sahel. In order to make platform for the coordination of the
ECOWAS Sahel Strategy operational, leaders for the infrastructure, resilience and security,
education, advocacy and monitoring and evaluation activity groups have been selected.
162. A series of technical meetings were held on the European Union fiduciary fund for the Sahel.
These meetings presented the activity areas of the fiduciary fund and the Commission was able to
submit project sheets to the European Union on projects in the agriculture and food security
areas.
163. Consultations were held in Abuja on 20 October between the Commission and the UN Office for
Africa and the Sahel during which the two institutions discussed the action plan for the ECOWAS
Sahel Strategy.
2.1.6 Economic Policy Analysis Unit (EPAU)
164. Economic policy analysis activities focused on the production of knowledge to aid decision-making.
The activities include:
 organisation of an International Conference on child poverty and social welfare in West and
Central Africa in collaboration with UNICEF
165. The Conference issued a Communique calling for and encouraging collaboration among the
governments of West and Central African countries, development partners and the entire

ECOWAS Commission

international community, to develop and implement strategies on the fight against child poverty
and social welfare in a coordinated manner.
 study on innovating funding mechanisms for the Commission
166. The study revealed that the performance of ECOWAS institutions in carrying out their functions
was greatly affected by the reduction in resources from the Community Levy and development
partners to the extent that the future remains uncertain.
167. The study noted the importance of leadership as an essential element in the mobilisation of the
Community Levy and funding from development partners and proper use of mobilised funds. The
study recommended capacity building for the Community Levy Unit and proposed other possible
ways of mobilising additional resources.
 study on rationalisation of travel costs at the Commission
168. The study confirmed the high cost of tickets purchased by the Commission in comparison to
prevailing market prices. It highlighted the failure to implement the agreement and contract signed
with ASky and CBM Travel Agency and recommended a review of the agreements and contracts
and enhanced monitoring of the implementation of any new agreement and the provision of travel
data to the Commission for regular analysis.
 study on the relevance of the salary mass ratio on fiscal revenues as a Community convergence
criteria
169. Due to financial constraints, the Unit was unable to carry out the study in all Member States. Only
some countries were able to conduct the study, the outcome of which will be validated shortly

Trade, Customs, Industry, Mines, Free Movement and Tourism

2.2.1 Trade
 Trade Policy and Promotion
170. Trade Policy: As a follow up to the First Regional Meeting on the Formulation of an ECOWAS
Common Trade Policy (CTP) in Accra, Ghana, in January 2016, the first meeting of the Technical
Working Group (TWG) on the CTP was convened in Abuja, Nigeria, in May, 2016. The meeting
considered the formulation of an ECOWAS CTP, and established scope, guidelines and
recommendations for consideration by the ECOWAS Commission and Member States. Three levels
of Working Groups – in concentric circles – were also established in the CTP formulation process:
Drafting Committee; Enlarged Group and General Group. The scope of the ECOWAS CTP was also
agreed upon. The Drafting Committee has since met on two occasions to draw the roadmap for
producing the draft CTP framework.
171. Trade Promotion (8th ECOWAS Trade Fair): Following the approval of funds for the organisation of
the 8th ECOWAS Trade Fair, the Commission undertook preparatory activities towards its official
launching. An MOU between the ECOWAS Commission and the Republic of Niger has also been
adopted, and ready for signature. However, due to the fragile financial situation of the
Commission, the 8th Trade Fair was postponed for the second time to a date to be mutually agreed
upon in 2017. A status update report, outlining issues such as actions taken so far, budgetary
implications of a second postponement as well as the way forward, was also prepared for
consideration by the ECOWAS Trade Ministers meeting.
172. Trade Information: To surmount the challenge of availability of reliable and up-to-date
information on trade and trade-related Protocols and Supplementary Protocols, the Commission is
working towards the development of a trade information database on the ECOWAS website. The
ECOWAS Commission

overall objective of this exercise is to enhance transparency of trade policy developments in the
region and to provide Member States and other stakeholders with an up-to-date picture of trends
in the implementation of trade and trade-related Protocols and Supplementary Protocols. To this
end, the Commission has collated up to date list of trade and trade-related Protocols and
Supplementary Protocols.
173. ECOWAS Regional Services Policy Review (SPR): Following the development of a methodology for
the conduct of the ECOWAS Regional Services Policy Review (SPR), with support from the United
Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) and GIZ, the ECOWAS Regional Services
Policy Review (SPR) was formally launched in July 2016. The SPR seeks, among other things, to
investigate regulatory, institutional and policy gaps and make recommendations on how to
address such gaps in selected services sectors across the West African region and to prepare the
region adequately for the Continental Free Trade Area (CFTA) negotiations and the West Africa –
European Union Economic Partnership Agreement (WA – EU EPA). The SPR will also serve as a
guide towards the formulation of a coordinated and consistent ECOWAS approach to services
trade. The ECOWAS Commission, in collaboration with UNCTAD and GIZ, also held a Trade in
Services Workshop in July 2016, which was aimed at strengthening the capacity of ECOWAS
services-related Directorates and private sector service suppliers
 Competition and Informal Trade
174. Competition: The signing of the Regional Authority Headquarters Agreement of the ECOWAS
Regional Competition Authority (ERCA) between the Republic of The Gambia and the Commission
in June 2016 during the Conference of Heads of State and Government remains a very significant
event for the future of business and fight against anti-competitive practices and unfair
competition in our region.
175. The ERCA created by the Supplementary Act A / SA.2 / 12/08 is the agent responsible for the
implementation of the Community Standards Competition rules and regulations within the
ECOWAS Community. To this end, the Commission is in the process of making arrangements for
the operationalization of the ARCC from 2017.
176. Informal trade: The Status of the Regional Programme of Support for the Regulation of Informal
Trade (ITSRP) in the ECOWAS were updated and submitted for co-financing of research under the
Community Development Programme (CDP). In addition, this programme has been shared with
other identified partners who indicated interest in being part of its operationalization.
 Trade and Development
177. ECOWAS – U.S. Trade & Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA): The 2nd ECOWAS – U.S. TIFA
Council meeting was held in Washington in September 2016, on the margins of the 15th AGOA
Forum. The ECOWAS – U.S TIFA, provides a strategic framework and principles for dialogue on
trade and investment issues between the United States and ECOWAS. The meeting discussed ways
of advancing the U.S.-ECOWAS trade and investment relationship in both the near and long term.
The Council meeting was preceded by the Technical Working Group and the Expert Group
meetings in April 2016.
178. Doha Development Round and WTO Ministerial Conferences: Following the 10th WTO Ministerial
Conference held in Nairobi in December 2015, the ECOWAS Commission commenced, in 2016, the
development of Post-Nairobi work programme to support Member States in implementing the
decisions of the Conference. Particular attention is being given to providing support for the
implementation of the WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA), with capacity building support
being provided through the TNCB project.

179. Aid for Trade: Following the adoption of the ECOWAS Aid for Trade strategy by the ECOWAS Aid
for Trade Expert Group in 2015, priority activities from the Action Plan are being implemented in
2016 in the following areas: building production capacity, trade related infrastructure and trade
policy and regulation.
 Trade Negotiation Capacity Building (TNCB) Project
180. Following the successful collaboration on the 1st e-learning course between TNCB Project and
UNITAR in 2015, the second e-learning course focusing on Trade Facilitation is being organised
from October – December 2016. The objective of the course is to provide 800 participants with a
greater understanding of the concept of WTO trade facilitation, its impact on domestic and
regional economy, as well as ECOWAS trade facilitation rules and regulation.
181. The TNCB project, in collaboration with the Trade Advocacy Fund (TAF) and GIZ/EU, held a
Regional Capacity Building workshop on WTO Dispute Settlement System in July 2016. The
workshop built the capacity of ECOWAS Member States and the ECOWAS Commission on the WTO
Dispute Settlement Mechanism, and also informed participants on the services of the Advocacy
Centre for WTO Law (ACWL) in order to increase their use of such services, which are readily
available to them.
182. Capacity workshops for the National Inter Institutional Committees of The Gambia and Senegal
were held on areas of support requested by the respective Member State. Additional workshops
are planned for Benin, Cabo Verde, Liberia and Togo in the last quarter of the year.
183. Hub & Spokes Programme: A memorandum on the status and challenges being experienced on
the implementation of the Hub & Spokes programme has been submitted to the President of the
Commission.
 Trade Negotiations and Management of Agreements
-

Economic Partnership Agreement

184. After the final approval of the EPA by the Heads of State and Government in July 2014, the
ECOWAS Commission is continuing preparatory activities for the implementation of the
Agreement by West Africa in 2016. The status of these activities is as follows:
185. Finalisation of the EPA signature: As part of processes for completing the signing of the EPA
between the EU and West Africa by the three remaining countries (Gambia, Mauritania, Nigeria),
the ECOWAS Commission has collaborated with the EU on the organization of workshops for
Nigeria’s key economic actors comprising manufacturers associations (MAN), chambers of
commerce and industry (NACCIMA), traders and other stakeholders throughout the year. The
objectives of the workshop were to raise awareness on the content and objectives of the EPA and
provide a high level platform allowing foreign (Europeans) and local investors in Nigeria to
understand and exchange ideas on the potential benefits arising from the entry into force and
implementation of the EPA.
186. Meetings with Representatives of Manufacturers Association of Nigeria: Furthermore, the EU
Delegation in Abuja and ECOWAS Commission held a number of technical meetings with the
representatives of the Manufacturers Association of Nigeria in April and October 2016. The
meetings involved discussions on the impact of the WA-EU EPA market access offer on certain
production sectors in Nigeria and the possibility of amending the agreement offered for
consideration during the regional EPA policy review mechanism every five years. Further
discussions were also held in collaboration with the European Commission for the organization of

a regional workshop for the private sector and civil society in West Africa in the last two quarters
of 2016.
187. Operationalisation of the EPA institutional framework: The EU and West Africa met in 2016 to
examine the draft rules of procedure of the joint EPA organs. The two sides agreed to continue
discussions to finalize these rules. Furthermore, the ECOWAS and UEMOA Commissions continued
working on the establishment of a regional consultation mechanism to ensure the appropriate
participation of the region, including the non-State actors, in the joint bodies of the EPA.
188. Implementation of the EPA Development Programme (EPADP): The EU and the ECOWAS
Commission agreed to commence the implementation of the EPADP prior to the entry into force
of the EPA. The earlier implementation of the EPADP aims at preparing West African States to
improve the competitiveness of their economies. In this regard, the EPA Regional Preparatory Task
Force (RPTF) meeting was held in 2016 with the participation of the EU member States and
European Investment Bank. The meeting considered the concrete modalities of the contribution of
these actors to the EPADP implementation. Furthermore, the implementation process of some
projects started, under the National Indicative Programmes (NIP) of the 11th EDF, particularly in
the areas of support for agriculture, energy and civil society. The identification of EPADP related
projects also continued in 2016 under the Regional Indicative Programme (RIP) of the 11th EDF,
particularly for tax reforms, infrastructure and strengthening private sector competitiveness. The
EU and West Africa continued working towards a common methodology to evaluate the fulfilment
of the EU commitment in the amount of 6.5 billion euros for the implementation of the EPADP.
189. Competitiveness Observatory: The EU and ECOWAS Commission adopted the Terms of Reference
for a feasibility study on the establishment of the Competitiveness Observatory. The draft report
proposing the methods of operation of the Observatory and the evaluation indicators was
concluded during the year and will soon be submitted to the Member States for validation. This
draft report provided relevant indicators and the modalities for establishing the Observatory as a
key tool for monitoring and evaluation of the EPA.

Ratification of Interim EPAs by Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire

190. In view of the delay in completing the signing of the WA-EU regional EPA, coupled with the fear of
losing the preferential trade terms currently enjoyed on the European markets, the Republics of
Cote d’Ivoire and Ghana have had to adopt measures for the implementation of their interim EPAs
with the EU in 2016. This is in compliance with the 2009 resolution of the European parliament.
191. Considering the threats posed to ECOWAS regional integration by Cote d’Ivoire’s and Ghana’s
implementation of interim EPAs with the EU, the Commission has proposed the organisation of a
meeting of the ECOWAS Trade Ministers for management consideration and approval. Subject to
approval, the meeting will consider the following recommendations:
a. For Member States that are yet to sign the EPA to accelerate their internal consultations; to
finalise political decisions and fast track the signing of the EPAs by the appropriate authorities
or their Ambassadors in Brussels. In this regard, these States may seek technical support of
the ECOWAS and UEMOA Commissions for the organization of internal consultations.
b. b. On the part of the ECOWAS and UEMOA Commissions;
- Intensify information dissemination and training of stakeholders on the content of the
EPA in all states of the West African region, and
- Continue, on the one hand with sensitization of stakeholders at regional level
(parliaments, private sector and civil society) and on the other hand, work with the
European Commission on the texts concerning the functioning of the joint bodies of
ECOWAS Commission

the EPA, to commence their implementation as soon as the signing of the regional
EPA is accomplished.
192. EPA communication plan: Following the adoption of the joint ECOWAS – UEMOA EPA
Communication Action Plan in November 2015, the ECOWAS Commission collaborated with the
EU in holding a sensitisation meeting on the EPA with Nigerian stakeholders in Lagos and Kano. A
national Media workshop on International Trade Agreements, with a focus on EPA, was held in
September 2016 for over 40 media practitioners from all the major media houses in Nigeria. This
workshop was followed by West Africa Regional Media workshop on the same subject area. The
workshops built the capacity of media practitioners to understand and improve their reporting on
Trade Agreements. These media workshops were followed with a dialogue with the MAN of
Nigeria with the objectives of further deepening and understanding the needs and concerns of
Nigeria’s major trade stakeholders, jointly review the status of the Commission’s efforts in
resolving the concerns and lastly jointly adopt a work programme and roadmap for engagements
with all the sector groups of MAN.
-

Continental Free Trade Area

193. Continental Free Trade Area (CFTA) negotiations: The Commission began the process of
formulating an ECOWAS regional strategy for engagement with other partners in the Continental
Free Trade Area (CFTA) negotiations with the organisation of a regional stakeholder consultation
meeting in March 2016. A draft ECOWAS strategy for the CFTA negotiations is currently ready for
validation. The ECOWAS Commission also participated in meetings of the African Union (AU) to
prepare Draft Agreements for the CFTA Negotiations in Nairobi – Kenya in May 2016, where the
Commission was given responsibility to chair the Trade in Goods Committee. At the Continental
level, the Commission participated in meetings (3 Meetings – February; May and October 2016) of
the CFTA Negotiating Forum. Other meetings that the Commission participated in included the
Continental Task Force on the CFTA and the Boosting Intra-Africa Trade (BIAT) workshops.
-

ECOWAS – China FTA

194. The Commission also began preparatory activities towards ascertaining the feasibility of an
ECOWAS China FTA with the formation of a Technical Working Group (TWG) to work with the
Chinese counterpart. Subsequently, the Commission held preliminary discussions with its Chinese
counterpart. It was agreed that Joint Feasibility Studies (JFS) should be conducted to determine
the feasibility of any possible agreement between the two parties. The JFS is to focus on
assessment of the economic structures, trade and investment policies, sensitive products, and
possible impacts. An MOU to launch the JFS is currently under consideration by both parties.
2.2.2 Customs
195. In 2016, the Commission focused efforts on the effective implementation of the Customs Union
particularly through the application of the ECOWAS Common External Tariff (CET) and
development of a strategy for more efficient implementation of the ECOWAS Trade Liberalisation
Scheme (ETLS). In the course of the year also, a new mechanism, the Task Force on the trade
liberalisation scheme, was set up to promote enhanced implementation of Community texts by
Member States.
196. It will be recalled that the ECOWAS Common External Tariff (CET) received the political
endorsement of the Authority of Heads of State and Government at the Extraordinary Summit of
25 October 2013 in Dakar. The Summit also instructed the ECOWAS Commission to take all

necessary measures to ensure the application of the CET in all Member States with effect from 1st
January 2015.
197. As at 31 December 2016, ten Member States would have started CET implementation, eight
Member States (Benin, Burkina Faso, Cote d’Ivoire, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal and Togo) started
implementation in 2015 while Ghana commenced on 1st February 2016. The last Member State to
implement this Community instrument is Guinea Bissau which officially launched the CET on 24
October 2016.
198. In conformity with the decision of ECOWAS Heads of State and Government, the Commission, in
between June and July 2016, fielded monitoring and evaluation and support missions to all
Member States, except Cabo Verde, to observe CET implementation at first-hand and make
specific recommendations to each Member State. In order to coordinate the technical and political
activities, the Commission organised the 57th meeting of the Technical Committee on Trade,
Customs and Free Movement, followed by a meeting of Finance Ministers in Dakar from 16 to 18
August 2016. At the meeting, the Ministers whose countries were behind schedule committed to
take all necessary measures to ensure implementation of the CET in their respective countries by
1st January 2017.
199. Concurrently with work on the CET, the Commission has finalised the technical aspects of the draft
ECOWAS Community Customs Code. In consultations with the UEMOA Commission held in early
April 2016, an agreement was reached on the content of the Code before it is transmitted to
Member States for validation. Technical validation of the Code will occur in the last quarter of
2016.
200. The Commission has also established a Regional Automated Transit System (RATS) for goods to
facilitate regional trade. A meeting of technical and financial partners to set up this important
project took place in Abuja in November 2016 with the support of the World Bank and World
Customs Organisation Group.
201. Concerning the formulation of a strategy for more effective implementation of the ECOWAS Trade
Liberalisation Scheme (ETLS), several applications approved under the scheme by the National
Approval Committees (NAC) of Member States were received at the Commission in the first four
months of 2016. Subsequently, the usual investigations were conducted and all Member States
were notified of the decision to issue product approvals where the applications met the
requirements on content and presentation. During the year, approval applications were submitted
by eleven of fifteen Member States, namely Benin, Burkina Faso, Cote d’Ivoire, Ghana, Guinea,
Guinea Bissau, Mali, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone and Togo. This bears evidence to the growing
interest of companies for the ECOWAS sub-regional market. All in all, 90 companies and 273
industrial products were approved and notifications issued to the 15 ECOWAS Member States
from March to September 2016.
202. A meeting between the ECOWAS and UEMOA Commissions was also held in the period under
review, to revise the legal texts relating to the Scheme in order to ensure uniformity of the texts.
203. Furthermore, ECOWAS Commission initiated an awareness creation and training campaign in
Member States on the Scheme which started in May 2016. Tours were also conducted in Cote
d’Ivoire and Senegal to assess implementation of the pilot project on automation of the certificate
of origin between these two Member States.
204. In order to have reliable data on products and companies approved under the scheme with an upto-date harmonised system (HS) from now till 2017 and for future statistical use, the Commission
commenced the harmonisation of nomenclature from 1990 to date. Similarly, in August, the

Commission conducted an assessment mission of the Scheme in all Member States. The mission
report will be presented at the next meeting of National Approval Committees in November 2016.
205. The Commission received a complaint by The Gambia against Senegal over the latter’s noncompliance with Convention A/P4/5/82 relating to Inter-State Road Transit (ISRT) of goods. In
early April 2016, the Commission dispatched a fact-finding mission to the two Member States with
the aim of determining the cause of the misunderstanding between the two Member States which
poses a threat to the free movement of goods within the Community and also propose measures
to resolve the dispute.
206. In order to improve the trade environment in the region and encourage Member States to
implement the Protocols and Regulations on the ECOWAS Trade Liberalisation Scheme as directed
by the extraordinary session of the Authority of Heads of State and Government held in Dakar,
Senegal on 25 October 2013, a Task Force on free movement of goods within ECOWAS was
established. The members of the Task Force were officially inaugurated by the President of
Burkina Faso in Ouagadougou on 20 May 2016.
207. The Task Force is an ad-hoc consultative body under the authority of the President of the ECOWAS
Commission. At the President’s behest, the Task Force will provide arbitration and amicable
settlement of disputes between Member States arising from ECOWAS ETLS implementation. It will
also provide advocacy and mediation with the high political authorities of Member States for the
full and proper implementation of texts relating to the ETLS.
208. The Task Force comprises seven imminent persons drawn from Member States with wide
experience regarding impediments to the growth of regional trade. Given the challenge of the free
movement of goods in deepening the regional integration process, the Task Force is chaired by Lt.
General Salou Djibo, former Head of State of Niger and Chairman of the Salou Djibo Foundation
(Fonsad).
209. For the harmonisation of indirect domestic tax and fiscal transition, the ECOWAS Commission
conducted a mission to Liberia in February 2016 to assess the status of preparations for the
introduction of VAT in line with Directive C/DIR1./05/09. The mission held discussions with the
relevant national authorities and identified a number of challenges, after which recommendations
on the way forward were made.
210. In the area of capacity building for tax authorities and implementation of the priority activities of
the ECOWAS fiscal transition programme, the Commission held training sessions for experts from
ECOWAS and Member States on specific areas of domestic taxation. Thus, a training was organized
with the support of the firm PricewaterhouseCoopers on modelling of tax revenue forecasts.
Training on auditing telecom, mining and petroleum companies, bank and insurance firms was
provided to experts from Member States.
2.2.3 Industry
211. The main activities undertaken in the context of industry relate essentially to the implementation
of the West Africa Common Industrial Policy (WACIP) which was adopted in 2010 and reviewed in
2015 by Ministers of Industry. Programmes that continued to be implemented and achievements
made during the review period are presented as follows:
 ECOWAS Quality Policy (Ecoqual)
212. The ECOWAS Quality Policy (ECOQUAL) is one of the key elements of the regional competitiveness
strategy and embodies: ECOWAS-EU Programme for Quality Infrastructure System, ECOWAS

 ECOWAS SECTORAL STRATEGY
221. In line with the revised industry strategy, processes have been initiated for the development of a
regional plan for the identified regional priorities (agro industry, pharmaceutical, automotive and
machinery).
-

AGRO INDUSTRY STRATEGY

222. An Agro industry value chains development framework has been set up which will focus on the
regional industrialization plan for three groups of products:
- products to be exported, such as cocoa, cashew, mangoes, cotton, shea butter, etc
- product for the regional market such as palm oil, cassava, rice, meat, sugar etc
- products to support the agro industry such as fertilizers, packaging, etc
223. A regional workshop was held in August 2016 to develop a regional framework for cocoa and
cashew processing in West Africa. Similar workshops for the development of investment plans will
be organized in 2017 with subsequent submission of resolutions to the sector Ministers.
-

ECOWAS REGIONAL PHARMACEUTICAL PLAN

224. The ECOWAS Regional Pharmaceutical Plan aims to increase access to essential medicines by
strengthening regional industrial production of quality medicines. Following the validation of the
plan and subsequent presentation to the sector Ministers, an experts workshop was held in March
2016 to consider the collection and revision of the regional list of medicines, pharmaceutical raw
materials and equipment and their respective tariffs under the Common External Tariff.
Furthermore, an experts meeting was held in Cote d’Ivoire in April 2016 on the development of
tariff lines for essential medicines within the framework of the Common External Tariffs.
-

ECOWAS AUTOMOTIVE AND MACHINERY INDUSTRY STRATEGY

225. In response to the directive of ECOWAS Ministers responsible for industry for the development of
regional Automotive Industry Strategy, efforts were made to develop the strategy within the
period under review (2016). Some regional discussions are ongoing, in particular with the Nigeria
Automotive Council with the view to setting up a regional consultation committee to harmonize
and develop the regional automotive industry strategy and promote a regional market for locally
assembled automobiles.
226. As a preliminary step, a regional workshop was organized in December 2015. One of the key
recommendations of that workshop was the drafting of regional trategy for the development of an
Automotive Industry in the region. Discussions are ongoing with the African Development Bank
(AfDB) to support the initiative to formulate a regional strategy for the development of the
automobile industry, which has been accepted for funding.

Commission in its engagement with Civil Society Organisations. The meeting reviewed the draft
Concept Framework of the Joint Forum and formulated the framework’s Implementation Matrix.
The CSOs on the Working Group have been tasked to engage in broad consultations on the drafted
documents for input from their peers.
228. Also, the Commission reviewed the ECOWAS Mining & Petroleum Forum’s (ECOMOF) Operational
Plan and Conference Planner’ through a retreat organized in March 2016, in Abuja as a follow-up
to the first Event (ECOMOF 2015) held in Accra in October 2015. The Abuja meeting also served
to conclude the activities of the Joint Committee of ECOMOF 2015.
229. The meeting made recommendations to guide the preparatory activities for ECOMOF 2017 and
formulated a ‘Model Operational Manual’ which provides details of the framework and modalities
for the operations of the Local organizing Committee (LOC) in particular, and the implementation
of activities towards successful hosting of the Forum in general. The main objective was to outline
the means by which human, financial, material and administrative resources allocated for the
organization of the Forum may be synchronized to ensure efficiency, effectiveness, and uniformity
of purpose. The Manual is intended to serve as a convergence tool and guide the organizing
partners.
230. In accordance with its regional cooperation activities in the geo-extractives sector, the Commission
has been facilitating the establishment of an ECOWAS Federation of Chambers of Mines. The Regional
Chamber is expected to be incorporated and privately owned by the National Chambers and mining-related
associations/affiliates. With the approval of the Draft Constitution by the Councils of Burkina Faso, Cote
d’Ivoire, Ghana, Guinea, Mali, Senegal, and Abuja Chamber of Commerce & Industry (Nigeria), the agreed
minimum criteria of the consent of at least five (5) Councils of the National Chambers has been satisfied,
thus paving the way for the establishment of the Federation of Chambers of Mines. An inaugural meeting has
therefore been planned for November 2016, in Accra, Ghana at which a Draft Resolution and the Draft
Constitution would be adopted.
231. In furtherance of the development of the ECOWAS Guiding Framework on Local Content
Development & Regional Cooperation in Geology and Hydrocarbon Sectors, the Commission has
undertaken preparatory activities towards the organization of the Joint National Mining / Geology
/ Hydrocarbons Experts and Joint Mining / Petroleum Ministers Technical Validation Meeting in
the last quarter of 2016.‘ The Guiding Framework outlines key issues on quality standards and
regional safety in relation to the geo-extractives sector, corporate social responsibility, localization
and local content development, regional cooperation in the Geology Sector and in Integrated
Industrial Development of Hydrocarbons.
232. On other policy development, considerable progress was made towards the procurement of
services for the formulation of an ECOWAS Mining and Minerals Development Act (Code, EMMDA)
and the ECOWAS Hydrocarbons Development Policy (EHDP) as well as the preparation of a
technical feasibility report for the ECOWAS Geo-extractives Observatory and Cadastre System and
ECOWAS Geo-extractives Database and Statistical Information Reporting Framework to guide how
development progress in the Sector s reported.
2.2.5 Free Movement of Persons and Tourism
 Free Movement

235. Surveys carried out on board Taxi and hidden cameras at the Côte d'Ivoire-Ghana, Ghana-Togo,
Togo-Benin, Benin-Nigeria borders revealed Police, immigration and customs Officers of these
borders withdrawing money from the citizens. Faced with this persistent and increasingly criticized
situation by the population, it is urgent to take severe sanctions.
 Tourism Development
236. ECOWAS has acquired a regional tourism policy and action plan (ECOTOUR 17/27) which is in the
process of being adopted. In addition, a new regulation for the classification of hotels and other
accommodation and feeding establishments has been put in place.
2.3 Agriculture, Environment and Water Resources
2.3.1 Agricultural Development
237. In 2016, the 10th anniversary of the adoption by ECOWAS Heads of State and Government of the
regional agricultural policy (ECOWAP) in January 2005 was celebrated. NEPAD, established by the
African Union, focuses on ECOWAP as part of its continental agenda. In addition, the main
achievements of this policy over the past 10 years, the activities implemented in 2016 in the area
of agriculture and rural development are included in this report.
a. 2005 - 2015 ECOWAP Implementation - Highlights
238. The 2008 global food crisis once more placed the Regional Agricultural Policy at the heart of the
region’s agenda and gave a decisive boost to ECOWAP implementation through the National
Agricultural Investment Plans (NAIP) and the Regional Agricultural Investment Plan (RAIP). These
programmes made it possible to inverse some historical trends and achieve initial results at the
institutional level and in terms of the impact on agriculture and food security in West Africa.
239. For the intensification of farming systems, crop farming and particularly cereals, recorded
considerable growth in the region. Cereal production grew by 59% between 2000 and 2012. The
highest increases were recorded in rice (95%) and maize (130%) production. There was also
appreciable growth in livestock and poultry production (48% for bovines and small ruminants, 85%
for poultry and 59% for pork). Other sectors are however hard-pressed to keep up with this trend,
such as the dairy and fish products. In spite of the intensification drive, increased production
volumes are linked primarily to the increase in the cultivated areas and livestock numbers. The
71% rise in paddy rice production between 2000 and 2010, is explained by the increase of the
yields
240. The achievements recorded include the deployment of a number of activities aimed at improving
productivity and strategic crops (rice, maize, and cassava) and pastoral farming, particularly the
intensification of production systems and enhanced productivity and structuring of sub-sectors,
making it possible to take the issues into account ahead of production.
241. Initiatives implemented by ECOWAS to guarantee food security for West African peoples include:
-

the “zero hunger” initiative to conquer hunger and malnutrition by 2025. It is a governance
reform framework which facilitates understanding of all aspects of food and nutritional
security. The following activities are part of this initiative (i) revision and adoption of the
Charter for food crises prevention and management in West Africa, extended to Chad and
Mauritania, and (ii) establishment of the Global Alliance for Resilience in Sahel and West
Africa (AGIR),

framework, table and indicator manual were validated by a group of ECOWAP-CAADP monitoring
and evaluation experts from ECOWAS Member States and regional and international stakeholders.
The process involves the preparation of the first 2016 annual report on ECOWAP-CAADP
monitoring and evaluation which will be validated and transmitted to the African Union.
-

Resilience, Prevention and Management of Food Crises

246. In close cooperation with CILSS, UEMOA, SWAC and partner institutions, meetings of the Food
Crises Prevention and Management Network (RPCA and PREGEC) led to the regular production of
early warning newsletters and newsletters on foodstuff price variations. The technical monitoring
group of the Global Alliance for Resilience (AGIR) Sahel and West Africa validated the draft
framework for the definition of resilience indicators and a roundtable on financing the country
Resilience Priority Plan (RPP) was held from 8 to 10 June 2016 in Lome to mobilise funds for
Member States.

States; (v) the preparation and publication of information on the West Africa fertilizer market
through a chart that shows all fertilizer manufacturers and mixers, as well as newsletters on the
consumption of fertilizers.
-

Supporting Seed Development

249. In 2008, ECOWAS adopted Regulation C/REG.4/05/2008, on the “harmonisation of rules
governing quality control, certification and marketing of plant and vegetable seeds within the
ECOWAS region”. Under the West Africa Seeds Programme (WASP/PSAO), the following activities
were carried out in 2016: (i) the 2nd Statutory Meeting of the Regional Seeds Committee that
helped to validate the updated Regional Catalogue of Plant Varieties and Species, the draft
implementing regulations, and the status of implementation of the above-mentioned regulation at
the national level; (ii) the meeting of the Alliance for Seeds Industry in West Africa (ASIWA) and
the launch of its e-platform for seed marketing (www.waxis.net); (iii) the preparation and
publishing of the West African Catalogue of Plant Varieties and Species with a record of 1,330
high-yield agricultural varieties of 11 species distributed to the 17 Member States of the ECOWASUEMOA-CILSS zone. The regulation’s level of implementation has progressed from 41% in 2013 to
87% in 2016. Countries that recorded significant progress with the application of 12 of the
regulation’s specifications are Benin, Burkina Faso, Nigeria, Cote d’Ivoire, Mali, Gambia, Senegal
and Togo. Followed by Ghana, Guinea and Niger (80-99%). Countries recording an averagely low
implementation are Sierra Leone, Liberia, Chad, Mauritania, Guinea Bissau and Cape Verde.
-

Management of Pesticides and Control of Obsolete Pesticides

250. At the beginning of 2016, the Regional Project for Pesticide Management and Pesticide Elimination
in the Sahel and in West Africa (PPM-SWA) was launched with the support of the Global
Environment Fund. Within this framework, six (6) out of nine Member States were able to set up
and restructure their National Pesticide Management Committee (CNGP) in keeping with
Regulation C/REG.3/05/2008 on the “harmonisation of rules governing the validation and
management of pesticides within the ECOWAS region”. An additional project was planned upon
recommendation from the FEM Steering and Advisory Committee and at the request of the
ECOWAS Commission. The project will cover the remaining Member States such as: Togo, Sierra
Leone, Guinea, Ghana, Nigeria and Liberia. A draft Memorandum of Understanding between
ECOWAS and UEMOA for the implementation of this regulation was submitted for signature to
synergise activities in the sector.
-

Cross-border Transhumance and Pastoralism

251. The 2016 activities were in line with Decision A/DEC.5/10/98 on Transhumance within the
ECOWAS region and regulation C/REG.3/03/01 that defines the Decision’s implementation and
identifies the roles and responsibilities of the stakeholders. The following actions were carried out
in the course of the year in conjunction with partners (the Billital Maroobé Network(RBM), APESS,
FAO and Ministries of Member States): (i) sensitizing States on the implementation of the
regulation, the publication, printing and distribution of the International Transhumance Certificate

Agricultural Productivity and Increase

254. A sum total of USD 456.8 million has so far been mobilised for the implementation of the West
Africa Agricultural Productivity Programme for the 13 participating countries of the ECOWAS.
Seeds weighing 8,500 tonnes, provided to Guinea, Liberia and Sierra-Leone towards rebuilding the
countries following the Ebola epidemic, enabled 200,000 farmers to produce in 2016. The 2016
evaluation of WAPP shows that after 8 years of implementation, the project has (i) affected 7
million direct beneficiaries, about 45 million indirect beneficiaries of which 42% are women
farmers (ii) generated 160 technologies inducing a rise in yield from 30% to 150%. The
technologies are currently being adopted by 3.5 million farmers and food processing plants.
Regarding the nine centres created for specialized learning created, 916 researchers have been
trained and are undergoing their PhD and MSc programmes.

404. The financial support and grants made it possible to immediately conduct Community sports
activities, providing great visibility to the ECOWAS of people.
405. Regular participation by most of the national wrestling teams is an indication that the practice of
this sport, recognised as a Community sport, has spread geographically in the ECOWAS region.
Subsequent years should lead to an established practice of the sport in Member States and will
involve the capacity building of national actors: federal boards, referees and coaches.
406. The regular organisation of ECOWAS wrestling tournaments, as a means to regional integration,
has had a positive impact on actors in the sector, and strengthened their sense of belonging to one
Community. The transmission of wrestling matches via national media as well as cable channels,
has wrought in Community citizens and those residing outside the ECOWAS geographic region, a
pride in belonging to a community that is capable of offering such sporting events, based on
shared cultural values.
- Development of Youth Employment
407. The youth employment programme, established in 2007, in line with ECOWAS youth capacity
building, enables trained youth to (i) increase their employability within the Member States; (ii) be
self-employed and able to employ other youths; and (iii) develop business relationships with other
youths, a medium for experience-sharing.
408. In preparation towards the 2016 training sessions for the agro-sylvo-pastoral sectors, and for
modules on refrigeration-air conditioning and automobile mechanics for youths of the 15 Member
countries, a preliminary mission was fielded to the partner learning centres. A Partnership
Agreement with the Centre de Formation Professionnelle de Reference, Ziniare (Burkina Faso)
with respect to the Modules on refrigeration-air conditioning and automobile vehicles, was signed.
A Partnership Agreement is yet to be signed with the Centre Songhai de Porto-Novo (Benin) for
modules on Agro sylvo pastoralism (Crafts – Fish farming – pig farming- gardening – agro-forestry
and on processing – mushroom– biogas – layer hens – broiler hens).
409. The training sessions are scheduled to hold before the end of 2016. Youth will come from the 15
Member States, 5 per State.
410. The Centre also forms a platform for the general public to make contributions towards the funding
(Crowdfunding) with a view to assisting trained youth with good business plans, to have the
necessary resources to finance their promising projects.

November 2016
436. The third activity is the meeting on the validation of the study on 2015 scientific productivity of
ECOWAS to be held in Abidjan from 21 to 23 November 2016. The study, developed by the African
Observatory for Science, Technology and Innovation (AOSTI), made it possible to obtain the
following indicators: the total number of publications in the region, the growth index (GI), the
specialisation index (SI), the average relative impact factors (ARIF), the average relative citation
(ARC), the collaboration index (CI), the most active researchers and research institutes, the
newspaper Classification used. The meeting brought together scientific experts from Member
States.
 Popularization of STI
437. The activity focused on the organisation of the African Union Kwame Nkrumah Award for women
scientists. The award is part of the promotion of scientific excellence and it aims at enhancing the

enhancement of ECOWAS collective cultural heritage, including museums and West African
languages.
 Forum on education for a culture of peace through inter and intra religious dialogue
441. A forum on education for a culture of peace through intra and inter religious dialogue, coorganised by ECOWAS and the Government of Niger, will be held on 22 and 23 November 2016 in
Niamey, Niger. The forum aims to create tools and trade frameworks to prevent crises that are
recurrent in our sub-region. In addition, it helps to create mechanisms for dialogue between
communities and ensures ownership of certain fundamental values which bear the stamp of
peace, tolerance and cohesion. The forum brought together ministers of culture, expert panellists
and three representatives per Member State. It was organised under the patronage of the Head of
State of Niger, the sponsorship of the Sultan of Sokoto and the Cardinal of Abuja with the
participation of prominent personalities.
 Co-production of a film about the red tape at borders
442. ECOWAS co-produced a film titled "borders" on the red tape at borders. ECOWAS co-produced
the film with the company, Selmon Film, Burkina Faso. The co-production of the film falls within
the context of the development of viable cultural enterprises capable of generating jobs and
income for the region. The film will help educate the West African people on ECOWAS
achievements as regards the free movement of people and goods within the region and reduce
barriers still present on the road corridors. The film will be shown at FESPACO 2017 which will
bring together festival-goers in West Africa.
2.6. Political Affairs, Peace and regional Security
 Early Warning and Response Mechanism
443. In the area of Early Warning, the Commission made significant strides in 2016 towards achieving
its overall mandate as contained in the 1999 Mechanism for Conflict Prevention, Management,
Resolution, Peacekeeping and Security. Key in this effort is the initiative to effectively bridge the
gap between early warning and response. Summary of these activities in 2016 include the
following:
- Operationalisation of National Early Warning and Response Mechanisms (NEWRM) in
Member States
444. The Commission undertook a mission in January 2016 to five pilot countries earmarked for the
establishment of the National Early Warning and Response Mechanism (NEWRM). The mission
visited Mali, Guinea-Bissau and Liberia to obtain information from the relevant authorities for the
provision of a suitable office space for the Centre to be established - an AUTOCAD floor plan of
the entire office building, and an implementation Task Force responsible for the launching of local
recruitment process of staff of the Centre. Another mission was undertaken in February 2016 to
the United States Department of State to update the State Department on the status of
preparedness of the five (5) pilot countries and solicit support for the establishment and
operationalisation of the NCCRMs.
445. In February 2016, the Commission organized a technical expert workshop on the EGDI in order to
prepare the Terms of Reference (ToR) for the setting up of the EGDI clearing house and training of
representatives of national mapping agencies from Member States. The Commission also
conducted NEWRM Implementation missions to the five pilot countries to ensure that
mechanisms were put in place for the full operationalization of the National Centres The key

objectives of the mission were to ensure the setting up of a Taskforce, identify a location for the
Centre and provide the floor plan, and prepare for the recruitment of staff of the National Centres.
446. Technical Study Workshop with the Environmental System Research Institute (ESRI), Redlands,
California A technical workshop was organised with the Environmental System Research Institute
(ESRI) in Redlands, California to discuss, among other things, an enterprise agreement for access
to the ArcGIS software platform which will make it easier and cheaper for ECOWAS to deploy the
ArcGIS software in the ECOWAS region and agree on a roadmap for the deployment of a
Geoportal for the Early Warning Directorate.
- Monitoring the Environment for Security in Africa (MESA)
447. A Monitoring the Environment for Security in Africa (MESA) receiving station is expected to be
installed in the ECOWAS Commission. The project will involve the installation of indoor and
outdoor equipment and continuous capacity building through onsite and online courses as well as
remote support from AGRYHMET and JRC for the technical staff of the Commission that will
manage the equipment. There will be connection to live data from EUMETCAST that will be
analysed to support decision makers in ECOWAS through the generation of periodic bulletins.
ECOWAS will also play the role of advocacy for earth observation data use.
- Deployment of Response at National Level
448. In order to enhance ECOWAS Member States’ capabilities to engage in the prevention,
management and resolution of local and national low intensity conflicts, the ECOWAS Authority of
Heads of State and Governments in July 2014 adopted the Framework on the establishment of
National Early Warning and Response Mechanisms (NEWRM) in Member States. With the
adoption of this framework, the Commission, in 2016, continued to undertake activities for the
effective and efficient deployment of the NEWRM through a participatory approach involving key
stakeholders.
449. Achievements realized included: (i) signing of a Presidential Decree in Mali on the establishment
of the National Centre for the coordination of the response mechanism and the setting up of a
taskforce to spearhead the implementation of NEWRM; (ii) provision of an office space for the
National Centre in Liberia as well as the AUTOCAD floor plans for the allocated building and the
first country ready for the shipment of materials/equipment; (iv) appointment of the chairperson
of the Task Force by the Vice President and commitment of other Ministries to nominate their
representatives on the Task Force; and (vii) signing of a decree on 2 March 2016 in Cote d’Ivoire
for the creation of the National Centre for the Coordination of the Response Mechanism.
 Political Affairs and International Cooperation
450. The President of the Commission attended the African Union Summits in January in Addis Ababa,
Ethiopia and in June in Kigali, Rwanda. In the course of the Summits, the ECOWAS delegation held
meetings and consultations with, among others: the African Regional Economic Communities
(RECS); the Danish International Development Agency (DANIDA); the Government of the Islamic
Republic of Iran; IDEA; the United Nations Department of Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO);
African Leaders Malaria Alliance (ALMA); and the United Nations High Commission for Refugees
(UNHCR). The ECOWAS delegation also attended the Donors’ Conference on the Multinational
Joint Taskforce (MNJTF) Against the Boko Haram Insurgency Group.
451. It would be recalled that the Fifth Meeting of the International Support Group on Burkina Faso
(GISAT-BF) was held in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso on 1st April 2016. The Group welcomed the
efforts of the Burkinabe government and pledged sustained support for the various efforts at

reconciliation, reform and recovery being undertaken by the government of Burkina Faso. In that
regard, they set up the International Support Group for the Consolidation of Democracy and
Economic Recovery in Burkina Faso (GIS-BF).
452. The 49th Ordinary Summit of the ECOWAS Authority of Heads of State and Government was held
on 4th June 2016 in Dakar, Senegal. It was preceded by the 36 th Mediation and Security Council
meeting held on 12th May 2016 in Dakar, Senegal and the 24th Mediation and Security Council
(MSC) meeting at Ambassadorial level held on 4th May 2016 in Abuja, Nigeria. The MSC at the
three levels discussed the latest political, peace and security developments in the region,
proffered a number of recommendations on how to improve the peace and security situation in
the region.
453. The ECOWAS delegation attended the 71st UN General Assembly in New York in September 2016
and held several meetings on the margins of the UN General Assembly, notably with the RECs and
the UN Agencies. In addition, a consultative meeting with the Heads of State and Government was
held to endorse the 6-point roadmap to resolve the Guinea-Bissau crisis, and a Ministerial meeting
on the situation in Mali.
454. The Internal Steering Committee (ISC) on the implementation of the ECOWAS Conflict Prevention
Framework (ECPF) convened two meetings at the ECOWAS Commission in 2016. The first meeting,
held on 11 April, 2016, focused on the development of a fund raising strategy for the effective
implementation of the ECPF and priority programmes for 2016. The second meeting, held on 14
June 2016, sought to inform Focal Point Directorates on the outcome of meetings with
Development Partners and lessons learnt from a Results-Based Management Training attended by
selected ECOWAS staff.
455. A Civil Society Organization (CSO) Sensitization Workshop on the implementation of the ECPF in
Member States was organized in Dakar, Senegal. Presentations were made on the progress made
in the operationalization of the ECPF, studies on the ECPF conducted by the Centre for Democracy
and Development (CDD), the Kofi Annan International Peacekeeping Training Centre (KAIPTC) and
the Goree Institute, and the urgency of preventing the effects of psychoactive substances among
youth in West Africa.
456. A Sensitization Workshop on the Implementation of the ECPF in Member States was held from
29 – 30 August, 2016 in Abuja Nigeria, at the ECOWAS Commission. The objectives of the
workshop were to: increase understanding of the ECPF as a practical guideline on conflict
prevention and peacebuilding, map priority areas in Member States on issues that need conflict
prevention interventions; and encourage Member States to take active steps to incorporate
regional and international statues on peace and security into national legislation.
 Democracy and Good Governance
457. A meeting on the establishment of a Civil Society Organization (CSO) Platform to Promote
Transparency and Accountability was held in Accra, Ghana. The objective of the meeting was to
institutionalize CSO involvement in the promotion of accountability and transparency in
governance.
458. The Annual General Assembly of NNHRI and NCSOHRM was organized in Abuja, Nigeria to review
and evaluate the report on the human rights situations and the rule of law in the ECOWAS region

459. A meeting on Promoting Media involvement in Participatory Governance was held in Accra,
Ghana, in August 2016, for preventive measures to address the issues of ‘hate media’ and other
matters related to electoral violence.
 Electoral Assistance
460. In the course of the year 2016, presidential elections were scheduled in five ECOWAS Member
States namely Niger, Benin, Cabo Verde, The Gambia, and Ghana. So far, elections have been
successfully conducted in Niger, Benin, and Cabo Verde.
461. Following on from the successes of Niger and Benin, the presidential election in Cabo Verde was a
huge success and a testament to significant advances in electoral democracy in the West African
region.
462. Earlier in the year, Cabo Verde held legislative elections in March 2016 and September 2016, and
organized municipal elections, closely followed by a presidential election in October 2016. In line
with its electoral assistance mandate, ECOWAS deployed a pre-electoral fact-finding Mission to
Cabo Verde in July 2016, followed by a Long Term Election Observation Mission in September
2016 and, finally, a Short Term Election Observation Mission a few days ahead of the 2 October
2016 election date. The Cabo Verdean electoral process went on smoothly with a number of
lessons drawn from it.
463. In response to rapidly rising tensions in The Gambia, a joint ECOWAS-AU-UNOWAS High-Level
Good Offices Mission went to the country in May to meet with stakeholders in ensuring peace and
stability in the country. In July, ECOWAS dispatched a Pre-election Fact-finding Mission to The
Gambia, whose findings indicated that the process has so far been characterized by disrespect for
fundamental human rights of citizens, absence of freedom of information, general lack of
confidence in State institutions, and the lack of an even playing field for all contestants in the race.
464. Ahead of the presidential polls scheduled to hold in Ghana, a Pre-election Fact-finding Mission
was deployed to the country in August. Mutual distrust between political actors in Ghana has led
to political tensions with accusations and counter-accusations regarding the alleged recruitment of
private militias by political parties. The level of preparedness of the Electoral Commission has also
been a cause for concern coupled with widespread scepticism regarding the credibility of the
electoral umpire. As a rapid follow-up to the situation in Ghana, a joint ECOWAS-AU-UNOWAS
High-Level Mission also went to Ghana in August to attempt to douse the tensions among
stakeholders. In line with its electoral assistance mandate, a Long Term Election Observation
Mission would be deployed from 15 November to 15 December 2016 and a Short Term Election
Observation Mission a few days ahead of the 7 December 2016 Ghana election date.
 Mediation and Facilitation
465. The ECOWAS Mediation and Facilitation Directorate (MFD) was established to backstop Mediation
efforts in the region. This entails operational mediation support to ECOWAS Mediators and Special
Envoys; knowledge and information management on mediation as well as capacity building of
ECOWAS staff and mediators working in Tracks I, II and III levels through competence and skills
enhancement on dialogue and mediation. As a newly established structure within the Commission,
the MFD, since 2015, have been successfully accompanying preventive diplomacy and mediation
efforts in the region.
466. In the course of the year 2016, the MFD has undertaken several initiatives that helped mitigate
political tensions, and strengthened knowledge management and mediation capacity in the
region. These, among others, include supporting the efforts of the ECOWAS Special Envoy for
Guinea Bissau and the ECOWAS Mediator in facilitating political dialogue involving stakeholders in

Guinea Bissau; embarking on due processes for the drafting and adoption of the Statute of the
ECOWAS Council of the Wise; facilitating the training for the enhancement of mediation and
negotiation skills of ECOWAS Special and Permanent Representatives and staff of ECOWAS
involved in conflict prevention; enhancing complementarity and coherence by undertaking
exchange visits to the African Union Commission (AUC) and the United Nations’ (UN) Preventive
Diplomacy and Mediation structures. In the last quarter of 2016, preparations are ongoing to hold
a Retreat of ECOWAS Special Envoys and Mediators as well as a Conference on Mediation
Experiences in West Africa and development of Mediation Guidelines, Standard Operating
Procedures and curricula on Dialogue and Mediation.
 Peace Support Operations
467. The ECOWAS Standby Force (ESF), in conjunction with the US AFRICOM, participated in the Initial
Planning Event and the Final Planning Event of Exercise Western Accord 16 held in January and
February 2016 in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso.
468. Other key activities that were implemented during the review period include: the organisation of
a Lessons Learned Workshop on Exercise AMANI AFRICA II FTX in Abuja, with the support of GIZ ;
the conduct by ECOMIB Headquarters in Guinea Bissau of a Contingent Owned Equipment (COE)
Inspection for the ECOMIB TCCs and PCCs in Guinea Bissau; participation in the Child Protection
Training and Standardization Workshop in Accra (Ghana)and the AU’s Comprehensive Protection
of Civilians (POC) Training Standards Framework and Strategy for the dissemination and utilization
of the POC Aide Memoire; and organisation of the inaugural meeting of the TCEs Working Group
in Accra, Ghana, in collaboration with KAIPTC and Training for Peace.
469. Besides, the Police Component is developing its strategies, programmes and activities with the
support of GIZ and work is in progress towards the organisation of a workshop to plan the
activities of the Police Component. .
 ECOWAS Standby Force-Task Force (ESF-TF)
470. During the period under review, the ESF-TF completed the following activities: reception and
handling of the equipment and other items donated by the American and Chinese Governments;
and participation in several training courses including a course in counter-terrorism in Ghana.
471. The ESF-TF also developed and deepened its relationship with partners such as the International
Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). Some other activities have been done jointly with the other
segments of the PSOD, namely the Review of Operational Framework and the SOPs for the ESF,
Amani Africa FTX Lessons Learned, Workshop, Western Accord 2016 Final Conference, and
ECOWAS CCDS extraordinary meeting on ECOMIB.
 Small Arms Control and Practical Disarmament
472. The implementation of the ECOWAS Convention on Small Arms and Light Weapons, their
Ammunition and Other Related Materials continued both at the regional and national levels based
on the 5 – year priority plan, 2010 - 2015 as approved by the Council of Ministers of Defence and
Security. The Member States continue to comply with the provisions of the Convention, especially
the ECOWAS Exemption Procedure which is the flagship of ECOWAS policy on arms transfers in the
region. In the same vein, Weapons Marking exercise continued, with Member States instituting
regional standards as provided for by ECOWAS with the assigning of unique markings for weapons
stockpiles in their armories.

473. The Arms Trade Treaty (ATT) has been in full force since December 2014 with the ECOWAS region
recording the highest rate of ratifications on the African Continent. Other disarmament and non –
proliferation initiatives such as the Chemical, Biological, Radioactive and Nuclear (CBRN) Weapons
Conventions are being coordinated at regional level in support of the effective compliance in
Member States in the region.
 APS Finance Cell
- ECOMIB
474. ECOWAS Mission in Guinea Bissau (ECOMIB) has had financial constraints since its deployment in
2012 despite the sustained resource mobilization efforts. A financing agreement was reached
between ECOWAS Commission and The European Union which was extended to 30 June 2016, the
end date of the Mission’s mandate.
- AFISMA
475. ECOWAS was charged with the responsibility for reimbursement of Contingent-Owned Equipment
(COE) to Troops Contributing Countries. Since the re-hatting of the Africa-led International Support
Mission in Mali (AFISMA) to the UN in July 2013, liabilities amounting to US$20,129,180 remained
outstanding to troop- contributing countries for COE reimbursement. At the same time,
contingents from some of the same countries are deployed to ECOMIB, thereby compounding the
financial burden on ECOWAS.
476. Several correspondence and follow-up actions to the United Nations for the disbursement from
AFISMA Trust Fund administered by the UN was met with little success. Efforts are still underway
in collaboration with African Union and UN Under-Secretary General for Field support to access
funds for COE reimbursements which is very critical in maintaining the integrity of ECOWAS and
the International Community in our collective will to pursue peace and security as well as facilitate
positive collaboration towards future Missions.
2.7. Information and Communication Technology (ICT)
 Strengthening the business information system (ECOBIZ)
477. Some initiatives were taken to broaden the scope of sensitization activities on the ECOBIZ system.
These include:
- Preparation of a concept note and terms of reference for review of ECOBIZ with the aim
of transferring its management to a private sector technical partner;
- Continuation of the process for identification and appointment of a technical partner for
the management of the ECOBIZ system.
 ECOWAS regional computer society consultation exercise
478. The Commission has played a key role in setting up an ECOWAS Regional Computer Society (ERCS).
The mission of the ERCS is to provide an avenue for the development of Information and
Communication Technologies (ICTs) and promote best practices within the region. The major
activity in this area has been assistance to the establishment and strengthening of national
computer societies in all ECOWAS Member States. To date, national computer societies have been
established in the Gambia, Nigeria, Senegal, Ghana and Cote d’Ivoire. The national computer
society in Cabo Verde is expected to be established by November 2016.

 Systems Development Activities (Intranet, Document Management, Work-Flows System, Etc.)
479. The ECOWAS email and collaboration systems were revamped to support and fully integrate with
the SAP solution. The email system has been deployed while the messaging and Intranet portal will
be launched before the end of 2016. The Commission’s intranet is to be linked to the Intranet of
other ECOWAS institutions to form the ECOWAS organisational intranet to provide collaboration,
communication and coordination facilities to improve ECOWAS’ organisational performance.
480. Ecosuite, the ECOWAS Intranet is a suite of applications made available to staff through a single
portal. It is designed to provide a one-stop location to provide collaborative and communication
tools to enhance productivity of staff.
481. Ecosuite is currently being configured to cater for general and specific needs of all the
Departments of the Commission. It is already available and accessible on the network through
using ECOWASmail username & password as credentials while within any of the Commission
premises or securely through virtual private network from outside. The second phase of this
project is the deployment to other Institutions and agencies of ECOWAS for seamless connection
and exchange of information.
 ECOWAS network & communications modernisation
482. The following were achieved in support of timely and efficient realization of the ECOWAS
mandate: - The first and second phases of the Network Infrastructure Modernization project were
implemented successfully, leading to the deployment of a Unified Communication System
with the Integration of Skype for Business, IP phones, and the E1 land line. This provides
Voice Over Internet Protocol (VOIP) communication between the Commission
Headquarters at Asokoro and the two annexes at River Plaza and Niger House in Abuja
and to the liaison office in Lagos respectively. The E1 line that had been dormant at the
Commission headquarters has now been integrated to enable the use of direct land lines
from the various offices at the Commission (thereby helping to reduce cost of using
mobile phones). With this deployment, the Commission now has 100 extension lines with
30 simultaneous calls. This deployment has been tested and is awaiting final
commissioning by Management. With this facility, staff of the Commission will now have
telephone lines directly to their offices and public phone number that can be accessed
directly from outside. Staff can now receive their calls directly on their IP phones,
computers and their smartphones thus providing flexibility and huge cost savings on
telephony. Plans are also in the pipeline to deploy solutions to effectively monitor and
control the usage before commissioning.
- The Data Centre Modernisation project commenced and is ongoing;
- Supported all Departments/Directorates of ECOWAS Commission as Internal IT support
team in acquiring, installing and maintaining IT systems.
- IT Service Management Support to the SAP project team was sustained during the period.
 E-Learning for Staff
483. The staff e-Learning facility was launched in July 2015. The facility will assist staff to acquire skills
and knowledge in disciplines related to the job function which engages their interest. Any staff,
regardless of institution and location is eligible and only needs to request for clearance to use the
facility from the HR Department of the Commission.

493. Considering the critical roles of the Member States in the implementation of the CSF, the Annual
Meetings of Heads of National Offices was organised in Lagos, Nigeria to discuss their role in the
CSF process as well as modalities for monitoring and enhancing their ownership of the process.
During the meeting, an institutional framework for mainstreaming the CSF into National
Development Plans of Member States was also discussed.
494. The costing and result framework for the CSF was done. Overall, the financing requirement is huge
and the Commission will need the support of international and regional Development Partners to
provide both financial and human resources. In this regard, the Commission will seek partnership
with NEPAD, South Africa and UNECA in Addis Ababa to finalise the Financial and Technical
Assistance roadmap prepared in 2015.
495. The Commission, going forward, would focus on the orderly implementation of the CSF by all
ECOWAS Institutions and Agencies. In this regard, a document on “Setting Programme Policy
Standards and Procedures” will be developed that will guide program implementation and
facilitate bi-annual reviews of program implementation.
2.8.3 Monitoring and Evaluation System
496. In line with its mandate to ensure probity and accountability in the implementation of all regional
integration programmes and projects, the Commission executed the following activities under
Monitoring and Evaluation during the period under review:
 Preparation of Programme Performance Reports
497. In order to provide Management with update on the status of implementation (physical and
financial) of the Work Programmes and Budgets of the Commission and other Community
Institutions / Agencies, the Commission prepared various reports namely, the 2015 Annual
Programme Performance Report; 2016 Quarterly Performance Reports; and 2016 Community
Performance Report
 Technical Collaboration with AUC/UNECA/AfDB and other RECs on the development of the
M&E Framework for Agenda 2063
498. In support of the implementation plan for the strategic framework developed to drive the socioeconomic transformation of Africa over the next 50 years i.e. the Agenda 2063, the Commission
participated in technical meetings of the African Union Commission (AUC), United Nations
Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA), African Development Bank (AfDB) and Regional
Economic Communities (RECs) on the development of the Monitoring & Evaluation (M&E)
Framework for the First Ten Years Implementation Plan of Agenda 2063.
 Finalisation of the draft Result Framework for the Community Strategic Framework (CSF),
2016 -2020
499. The CSF Result Framework is a management tool that will assist ECOWAS monitor and improve its
performance to achieve the Community goals set out in the CSF. It translates the goals outlined in
the CSF into a detailed set of indicators and targets to help ECOWAS plan its work better and
sharpen its focus on delivering result. Therefore, it is a primary tool for mainstreaming managing
for result across the Community. The draft Result Framework of the CSF was reviewed by technical
experts during the 2nd M&E Coordination team meeting held in March 2016 in Nasarawa State,
Nigeria. The experts provided comments and inputs for the finalisation of the framework.

 Technical Support to the African Capacity Building Foundation
500. The African Evaluation Association noted that most Member States have domesticated laudable
policies for economic development but implementation is at highest 7%. In order to ensure the
achievement of Agenda 2063 and SDG 2030, the ECOWAS Commission participated in the regional
monitoring and evaluation capacity building programme and provided key inputs to the
brainstorming session. Basically, problem analysis of the prevailing capacity dearth of M&E both
from the demand and supply side was carried out and specific interventions were proffered.
2.8.4 External Relations
501. The period under review was characterised by the continuation of actions aimed at promoting
Member States’ ownership of regional programmes and strengthening coordination in resource
mobilisation for the implementation of the regional agenda in line with international
commitments.
502. Following the adoption of the Operational Manual for use by ECOWAS National Offices by the 71st
Ordinary Session of the ECOWAS Council of Ministers, the Commission initiated an outreach
process of the Manual, both at Commission level and in Member States, in order to ensure
effective internalisation and ownership.
503. To strengthen its relations with Member States, the Commission has strengthened its cooperation
with the Permanent Representatives of ECOWAS in Nigeria through regular high-level quarterly
meetings which ensure better communication between the two parties. Regarding Resource
Coordination and Mobilisation, the period under review was characterised by various
consultations in line with the implementation of coordination mechanisms established to ensure
regular discussions on the regional agenda and support strategies of development partners. The
activities of Thematic Groups: Agriculture – Peace, Security and Humanitarian Affairs were carried
out in accordance with established schedules. However, those relating to capacity building,
infrastructure and economic integration and trade had modest activities.
504. Concerning bilateral cooperation which aims at strengthening diplomatic relations, the
Commission accepted the accreditations of eleven (11) new ambassadors3.
505. In pursuit of its goal to boost cooperation with Asian countries, the Commission signed, in January
2016, five (5) cooperation agreements with the People's Republic of China for the implementation
of development projects relating to the construction of the Abidjan - Lagos highway, railways, a
headquarters for the Commission and support in the areas of information and communication
technology and aviation. Negotiations with the country in March resulted in donations of
equipment and other military equipment worth about $ US5 million for the ECOWAS Standby
Force (ESF).
506. Regarding cooperation with Japan, the Commission participated in the 67 th Tokyo International
Conference on African Development (TICAD VI) held in August 2016 in Nairobi, Kenya. The highlevel meeting enabled the Commission to take stock of its cooperation with Japanese authorities,
particularly with senior executives of the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) and to
state the prospects for its enhancement through the effective involvement of Japan in the funding
of ECOWAS priority projects with the resources pledged at TICAD VI amounting to over USD 30
billion.
507. As regards the strengthening of its strategic partnerships, particularly multilateral ones, the
Commission initiated a series of consultations, including consultations with the Organisation for

Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) with which advanced discussions are ongoing to
enable it obtain observer status and get many benefits through the partnership, including the
benefit of obtaining the attention of the OECD members and the mobilization of technical and
financial resources necessary for the implementation of community programmes.
508. Consultations and efforts to strengthen cooperation with the World Bank, the African
Development Bank (AfDB), Sweden (support for the climate change programme), the French
Development Agency (AFD for agriculture projects), the USAID, Spain (migration Fund and
multisectoral support), Denmark (CPCC 4), Germany (multisectoral support), continued during the
period under review, with good prospects.
509. With regard to cooperation with the EU, the Commission shall ensure the implementation of
ongoing projects under the 10th EDF. It initiated the establishment of a more dynamic
coordination mechanism (EU-ECOWAS bi-monthly coordination meetings), and works with the
UEMOA, the EU and Member States to finalize the process of identifying and formulating projects
under 11th EDF RIP which has a budget of EUR 1.15 billion and covers the 2014-2020 period.
510. Expert meetings (Technical Working Group: TWG) and high level meetings (Strategic Orientation
Committee: SOC) set up as part of the new governance of the RIP, and alternately organised in
West Africa and Europe by both parties (AO + EU) were actually held in June 2016 in Lomé, with
the participation of the Authorising Officers (AO) of the EDF. They provided an opportunity to take
stock of cooperation between the AO and EU. Under the Commission's achievements, another
point worth noting is the signing of new cooperation agreements, notably with Turkey (private
sector), the World Bank (multi-sectoral), Israel (agriculture), Portugal (language capacity building),
Germany (multi-sectoral), the Conseil de l’Entente (multi-sectoral) aimed at strengthening the
cooperation and contribution for the implementation of the regional integration agenda.
511. Lastly, it should be noted that the Commission participated in the Conference on AGOA held in
September 2016 in Washington and in the 71st United Nations General Assembly held in New York
in September 2016
2.8.5 Relations with other ECOWAS Institutions
512. This relatively new programme of the Commission is intended to deepen the Commission’s
relationship with other ECOWAS institutions by improving cooperation, coordination and
harmonization of activities and programmes and engagement dialogue. Pursuant to this objective,
the Commission deepened its engagement with the ECOWAS Parliament and Community Court of
Justice by actively participating in the working sessions of the two institutions.
513. The relationship received further boost during the year with the assumption of duty of the new
Management of ECOWAS Commission. At the 4th Extraordinary Session of the ECOWAS
Parliament held in Abuja on 11 April 2016, the President of the Commission reassured Parliament
of the Commission’s support and close collaboration to ensure synergy and attainment of the
common goal of the community.
514. Following fruitful consultations and discussions with the leadership of Parliament, the President
set up an Ad’ hoc Committee on the enhancement of the Power of the ECOWAS Parliament,
headed by the Vice President of the Commission, to study the issue which has hitherto marred the
relationship between the two Institutions and make appropriate recommendations on how to
move the process forward. After several working sessions and dialogue with the Parliament, the
Committee finally agreed on September 2016 on the Supplementary Act on the enhancement of
the Power of ECOWAS Parliament.

515. The Commission also moved to initiate dialogue with the ECOWAS Bank for Investment and
Development (EBID) with a view to revitalizing relationship between the two institutions.
2.8.6 Human Resources
516. With respect to human resources, the Commision’s activities during the review period related to
the following:
 Recruitment into the eighty-five (85) critical positions
517. It would be recalled that the Council of Ministers at its 73 rd Session held in Abuja in December
2014 approved the recruitment into seventy-five critical positions across all Institutions and
thereafter approved an additional ten (10) critical positions making a total of eighty-five (85). A
phased-approach was adopted for the recruitment as the HR Recruitment portal could not
handle the huge volumes of applications that were submitted. Sixty-four (64) positions have been
advertised so far with ten (10) Director positions interviewed and background checks underway.
The publication of the third and final batch (twenty-one in all) as well as other positions that are at
various stages of the recruitment process, have been suspended following the adoption of the
cost-cutting measures proposed by the Commission and adopted by the 76 th Session of Council in
Dakar on 13th May, 2016.
 Recruitment of Statutory Staff
518. It will be recalled that at its 43rd Ordinary Summit held on 18th July, 2013, the Authority of Heads of
State expanded the ECOWAS Commission from a nine (9) member to a fifteen (15) member
Commission. Consequently, six (6) new Commissioners and a Financial Controller who were
recruited assumed duty in February 2014. This created a two years gap between the tenures of the
two sets of Commissioners. In a bid to harmonise the *end of tenure of Statutory Appointees, a
new batch of Commissioners was appointed in February 2016 for a two years’ tenure, to replace
the outgoing nine Commissioners whose mandate ended on 31st January, 2016, in accordance with
the Decision of the Authority of ECOWAS Heads of State and Government at their 48 th Ordinary
Summit held on 16-17 December, 2015, in Abuja, Nigeria.
 The Institutional Reform Process
519. Following the engagement of the Institutional Reform Consultants, Maxwell Stamp Plc, and as
directed by the 66th and 68th Ordinary Sessions of Council, the Institutional Reform Process began
in earnest on 1st July, 2013. The Consultants met and discussed with all Heads and management
teams of the various ECOWAS Institutions and are already at an advanced stage of their proposals.
They have already made and reviewed various proposals with Management. The reports of Phases
I and II have been presented to Council and have been approved accordingly and the
implementation phase is to be initiated.
 Laissez-Passer
520. Following the signing of the contract and the user-acceptance test, the biometric Laissez-Passer
(LP) that conforms to international security standards, has already been delivered. The
Commission received approval for the three-letter code of XEC in December, 2015. Samples of the
e-biometric laissez-passer were distributed to Member States at the 40 anniversary ceremony held
in December 2015 for dissemination. The e-Biometric Laissez-Passer was fully launched in
January, 2016 and issuance has officially started. Specimen LPs are yet to be circulated to RECS,
International Organisations and all other countries in the world.

 Pension Scheme
521. The ECOWAS Pension Scheme was expected to be operational from 1 st January, 2015, following
the signing of the contract with Alexander Forbes, Kenya. However, due to some administrative
issues mainly associated with the late submission of relevant data from some of the Institutions,
the Scheme was delayed. Following the submission of the relevant data, the Consultant, Alexander
Forbes, Kenya, submitted their Report as agreed on 20 September, 2015. From 11 to 13
November, 2015, the Consultants presented their valuation and progress reports to the Board of
Trustees (BoT) which exposed a number of key issues regarding the state of the pension.
522. Following a series of delays due mainly to absence of requisite data, the Scheme finally took off
this year with the initial payments effected in June. Meanwhile the possibility of handing over the
management of the Fund to an independent pension fund administrator is being explored.
 Revision of Staff Regulations
523. One of the major objectives of the Commission in the area of human resources is the revision of
the ECOWAS Staff Regulations to make them more responsive to staff needs and to reflect the
expected outcome of the current Institutional Reform Process. In line with this, and using the
participatory approach (involving all staff of the various Institutions) for the review, a draft
document was agreed upon by staff and Management of the various ECOWAS Institutions. The
said document was submitted for vetting by the relevant ECOWAS Sectoral Organs: the Ministries
in charge of Public Service and Legal Affairs in the various Member States at a meeting held in
Guinea Bissau from 15 to 19 March, 2016. The final document as reviewed and amended in Bissau,
is due for submission to the AFC and Council in November this year, for recommendation and
adoption respectively.
 Human Resource Management Actions
524. Over the period, the Commission has improved its Performance Management System as it is
equally important that the Performance Planning and Evaluation exercise enables it to closely align
staff aspirations to the strategic goals of the organization and give supervisors a clear way to
improve the performance of their staff. The exercise has enabled the Commission to provide the
basis for human resource management actions such as salary increments, promotions, training
and development, career management, talent management, redeployments etc. The
Commission’s bid to address staff complaints has led to the institution of regular meetings of the
various Advisory Committees on a quarterly basis to handle such matters.
525. This has also resulted in quarterly visits to Institutions and Agencies to address critical human
resources issues to ensure alignment and synergy of all HR practices, activities and processes.
These visits have resulted in the following:
- Increased knowledge of services available to ECOWAS staff in different Institutions (eg.
Contract Renewals, Benefits & Allowances; Leave Administration, Medical
reimbursements etc);
- Resolution of issues faced by ECOWAS staff and Institutions (eg. Discipline, Career
Development, Training, Promotions, and General Motivation etc.);
- Improved relationships amongst ECOWAS staff;
- Harmonisation of procedures, processes and policies in ECOWAS Institutions (e.g.
Structures, staffing needs, etc.).

 Major Issues/Challenges

527. Precariousness of employment - One of the major issues that the Commission is confronted with
is the precariousness of the situation of contract staff. One of the resultant effect of the
continuous embargo placed on recruitment has been a serious human resources deficit in all the
offices and departments in Community Institutions. With the mandate given to the Commission
and its institutions to drive the integration process, it is impossible to make any meaningful
progress without the requisite staff to execute programmes.
528. In this regard, Community Institutions, sometimes with the assistance of Development Partners,
resort to the hiring of contract staff to help in the implementation of regional integration activities
and programmes as well as the Commission’s priority projects.
2.8.7 General Administration
529. In the area of General Administration, the following activities were carried out:
- Conducive work environment was provided to ensure that all staff carried out their work
and responsibilities in an efficient, effective and continuous manner. In the area of security,
sufficient arrangements were made to prevent any serious breach of security despite the lack
of the requite security equipment.
-

Administrative services and support were provided to the nine new Statutory Appointees
that arrived in March 2016 to enable their smooth installation, while support was given to
the old appointees who had served their term in the transportation of their personal effects
home.

-

Providing a decent accommodation for the President of the Commission is considered a sine
qua non for the effective and efficient performance of his duties and responsibilities. To this
end, a contract has been awarded for the renovation of the official residence of the President
of the ECOWAS Commission. It is expected that the works will be completed by end of
October, 2016 to enable the President assume occupancy.

-

Other activities that were carried by the Commission in the area of general administration
that are intended to improve the work environment of staff and raise productivity included:
the installation of a biometric attendance system that helps monitor staff movement,
development of an Operational Manual that provides information on the various services
provided by the relevant departments / directorates /units and how they can be accessed as
well as the award of a contract for the installation of a mini solar plant at the Headquarters of
the ECOWAS Commission.

-

Following the completion of the first phase of the ECOWAS Logistics Depot in Lungi, Sierra
Leone and subsequent hand over to the Commission in October 2015, the process for the
commencement of the second and third phases of the project was initiated with the
convening of the Meeting of Experts of the Ad Hoc Ministerial Committee on Construction of
Headquarters of Community Institutions in Freetown, 26th – 27th September, 2016.

-

An important accomplishment during the year was the resolution of the long standing debts
owed Messrs N. Stephens Builders Limited and AIM Consultants through an out-of-court
settlement initiated by the Commission. The two entities took the Commission to court for
non-payment of fees with respect to the renovation of the Headquarters building in 2009.
The initiative saved the Commission a total of one million, four hundred and eighteen
thousand, five hundred U.S. Dollars (US $1, 418, 500. 00).

530. The Commission’s activities related to support services includes procurement of goods, works and
services. In this aspect, the total volume of procurement activities carried out as at 30 th September
2016 amounted to UA 6, 798, 138.90 (U.S.D. 9,510,875.01) with the breakdown as follows:
- Goods UA 900,215.23
(U.S.D. 1,259,438.00)
- Works UA 96,0456.35
(U.S.D. 134, 372. 78)
- - ServicesUA 5,801,877.32
(U.S.D. 8, 117, 064.23)
2.8.8 Communication
531. The Commission has been contributing immensely towards the support of regional journalists and
media practitioners in building their capacity through specialized training and harmonization of
the regulatory environment for media practice. During the year under review, the Commission, in
conjunction with the Friedrich Ebert Stiftung Foundation, kicked off a “Get to know ECOWAS”
Training initiative for regional journalists, comprising journalists from 15 Member States under the
age of 35. The training provided an opportunity for the Commission to engage young regional
journalists towards gaining in-depth knowledge of ECOWAS and its activities and understanding
the role of the media in advancing “ECOWAS of the people” within the context of ECOWAS’ Vision
2020.
532. In sustenance of its efforts to key into the online platform as medium to enhance visibility, the
Commission upgraded the ECOWAS website to a modernized html5 standard in which users can
now visit the website with different kinds of devices ranging from smartphones to computers. The
website, which is now also available in the three official ECOWAS languages, has also been
revamped with a feedback mechanism that allows visitors to share information and opinions. In
order to consolidate its online presence and increase visibility, the Commission also tapped into
major social media platforms including Facebook and Twitter which enables a wider reach for
information dissemination and a window for feedback from community citizens.
533. During the year under review, the Commission published and circulated two editions of the
ECOWAS Newsletter “ECHOES of ECOWAS” which highlights the activities and major achievements
of the Commission. The newsletter has also now been improved from a leaflet to a widely
circulated 20 - page publication which is now available for the first time in French and Portuguese.
534. The Commission also made great strides towards standardizing the ECOWAS Corporate Identity
and the development of a Corporate Identity Management Manual. This project is aimed at
harmonizing the visual representation of the institution in line with international standards and is
being realized through the donor support from GIZ. The implementation of this project
commenced with the recruitment of a consultant/specialist by GIZ.

535. In fulfilment of Article 9 (6) of the Revised Treaty on the publication of documentation of the
activities and decisions of the Council, new issues of the Official Journal Volumes 63-66 were
collated and processed for printing
536. Over 1800 reference enquiries were received and attended to from within the community and
outside. These enquiries ranged from simple facts on the institution to requests for documents
relating to integration as a concept and achievements of the ECOWAS Commission.
537. Adequate reprographic, minor printing and binding services were provided during the period.
Video/photo coverage of over 1200 meetings and events held within and outside the Commission
during the period were adequately documented.
538. An ECOWAS Repository database D-Space has also been configured and installed for use in the
Library. These will represent the institutional memory, providing the historical evidence of its
actions and decisions.
2.8.9 Finance
 Implementation of Community levy Protocol
539. Although ECOWAS Institutions have enjoyed a steady flow of revenue since the inception of the
full regime of the Community Levy in July 2003, last year’s operations of the Institutions
experienced serious financial strains. There were issues of compliance of the Community Levy
Protocol by Member States. In response, the Council of Ministers established the Community Levy
Management Committee whose role, among others, is to report regularly on the implementation
of the Community Levy Protocol. The Committee has consistently and regularly drawn the
attention of Council, through its reports to the Administration and Finance Committee (AFC), on
the status of
implementation of the Community Levy Protocol. However, the Community
continues to face funding limitations due to non-compliance of the Protocol by Member States.
540. During the review period, the Commission in execution of the provisions of the Community Levy
Protocol and the Supplementary Decisions of the Council of Ministers, continued to undertake
both High Level and Technical Monitoring Missions to Member States to ensure implementation of
the Protocol. Also, due to the mounting challenges of non-compliance by Member States the new
Management took upon itself to embark on an aggressive drive for revenue generation.
541. Thus on the High level drive, the new Management undertook various visits to and consultation
with Member States with a view to improving the cash position of the Commission. The Member
States visited include Cape Verde, Cote d’Ivoire, Guinea, Guinea Bissau and Nigeria. In addition,
the President of the Commission made direct formal and informal contacts with all Member States
regarding their financial position with the Community. These efforts have yielded significant
results in the year under review with many Member States improving significantly on their
previous years’ performance.
542. Thus, out of the 2016 approved Community Levy revenue budget of UA195,939,332, an amount of
UA127,166,937 was collected as at 30th August 2016, representing 65% of the 2016 Community
Levy revenue budget. This shows that the revenue budget was on target, and has also enabled the
proper functioning of the Community Institutions which were earlier hampered by inadequate
funding in previous years.

 Implementation of Ecolink in ECOWAS Institutions
543. During the reporting period the Commission continued with the implementation of ECOLink,
which resulted in the development of an integrated administrative and financial management
system on a real-time basis in ECOWAS Institutions. This is expected to improve transparency and
prudent financial management, corporate governance and risk management. It is also helping to
align ECOWAS organizational strategies and plans through visibility of operations and improved
decision making processes.
544. It is expected, upon full implementation and resolution of post-implementation issues, that the
system will contribute to significant improvement of the Community’s financial management
system and in addressing various concerns from the Council of Ministers and ECOWAS Donor
Partners alike who are yearning for a more robust, transparent and comprehensive reporting
system for ECOWAS Community Institutions.
545. In this regard, Management set up a Project Governance structure which comprises a Project
Steering Committee (PSC), chaired by the Commissioner for Finance, and a dedicated Project
Team. The PSC comprises Heads of Finance of ECOWAS Institutions, Directors of Administration,
Human Resources and Community Computer Centre from the Commission as well as the Financial
Controller and the Chief Internal Auditor. It is the body that provides the Project Team with policy
direction and ensures effective monitoring, coordination and reporting to Management on the
project progress.
546. Sequel to the implementation of Wave 1 (Financial Management & Control, Material
Management) of the project, the Commission, with the assistance of the European Union,
engaged the services of Quality Assurance (QA) Consultants to review all the activities of Wave 1.
The QA report highlighted series of shortcomings that occurred in Wave 1 that require rectification
to enable the Commission enjoy the full benefits of the system. Thus, an Implementer has been
engaged to work with the Commission to rectify the issues raised on Wave 1 implementation to
enable the Community proceed to Wave 2 (Human Capital Management & Travel Management) of
the project. Furthermore, the Commission has also engaged a Support Consultant to accompany it
in resolving Wave 1 issues and preparation for the implementation of Wave 2.
 implementation of international public sector accounting standards (IPSAS)
547. During the review period, ECOWAS Commission with assistance of the World Bank, engaged the
services of an IPSAS expert who conducted a Gap Analysis (‘as-is’ vs ‘should be’) between ECOWAS
existing accounting practices and IPSAS (International Public Sector Accounting Standards). This
Gap Analysis contains the identification and analysis of current ECOWAS financial policies and
practices and assessment of important issues and problems associated with current financial
policies and practices. The expert identified accounting issues by reviewing various ECOWAS
documents, including ECOWAS’s financial statements and the ECOWAS Revised Treaty, Financial
Regulations, and Manual of Accounting Procedures, and by corroborative enquiries during
interviews with ECOWAS staff. Subsequently, position papers were developed exploring
accounting issues in the transition to IPSAS and presenting various accounting treatments
regarding:
- Presentation of budget information in the financial statements
- Segment reporting
- Related party disclosures - key management remuneration and loans
- Revenue recognition of transfers by donors
- Functional and presentation currencies
- Concessionary loans

ECOWAS Institutions. The team has adopted a work plan and is also developing additional
position papers for the ‘Gaps’ identified by the consultant. In addition, training of staff on the
Principles of IPSAS is scheduled to hold at the IAS Seminar facility in London, United Kingdom and
Paris, France in October 2016 and January 2017.

CHAPTER III: ECOWAS COMMON EXTERNAL TARIFF: ACHIEVEMENTS, CHALLENGES AND
PROSPECTS
3.1 Background
549. Article 3 of the revised ECOWAS Treaty makes the establishment of a free trade area and the
creation of a Customs Union the important steps for the achievement of regional economic
integration.
550. Since its establishment in 1975, ECOWAS has made significant progress, notably in the adoption
and establishment of a regulatory framework to regulate the movement of people and products
originating in the Community. Although tariff and non-tariff barriers and obstacles still exist here
and there, the ECOWAS free trade area is a reality, and actions are taken by all stakeholders to
improve the functioning of the intra-community trade.
551. Regarding the Customs Union which is a higher step than that of the free trade area, the process
of its implementation has been extremely difficult due to the complexity of work and economic
and political issues for Member States to move towards the harmonisation of customs tariffs at
Community level.
552. It is worth recalling that in 1999, given the slow pace noted in the achievement of the objectives of
regional integration as set out by the revised Treaty, the 22nd session of the Authority of Heads of
State and Government approved in Lomé, by Decision A/DEC.2/12/99, the strategy for speeding
up the ECOWAS integration process for the creation of a single regional market in West Africa
based on trade liberalisation, the establishment of the common external tariff and the
harmonisation of economic and financial policies of Member States.
553. During the 24th session of the Authority of Heads of State and Government, held in Bamako on 16
December 2000, the operational modalities of the strategy for the acceleration of the sub-regional
integration process in West Africa were adopted. In that regard, the ECOWAS Executive Secretariat
was asked to strive for the advent of the ECOWAS Common External Tariff using as reference the
UEMOA Common External Tariff which was adopted by UEMOA Member States in 1997.
554. On that basis, an analytical work was undertaken by the ECOWAS Executive Secretariat since 2001
to assess the feasibility of migration of the national customs tariffs of seven (7) non-Member
States of UEMOA (Cabo Verde, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria and Sierra Leone) to the
UEMOA CET.
555. Impact studies were carried out in each of the non-UEMOA States to assess the impact of the
scenario on public finances, the economic fabric and businesses. After several meetings with
Member States, the action plan for the implementation of the ECOWAS CET was submitted for
consideration to the Authority of Heads of States and Government held in Niamey in 2006.
556. Against that background, the Authority of the Heads of State and Government at its twenty-ninth
(29th) session in Niamey (Niger), adopted by Decision A/DEC.17/01/06 of 12 January 2006 the
Common External Tariff for ECOWAS Member States (CET/ECOWAS) as a vehicle for the creation
of a Customs Union and a Common Market in West Africa.
557. During the extraordinary session of their Authority held on 25 October 2013 in Dakar (Senegal),
the ECOWAS Heads of State and Government endorsed the structure of the ECOWAS CET and
approved the date of 1 January 2015 for the effective launch of its implementation in all Member
States. The Authority launched the implementation in the Community at its 46th Summit held in
Abuja on 15 December 2014.

558. The document seeks to identify the progress, challenges and prospects of the implementation of
the ECOWAS Common External Tariff (CET) in Member States.
3.2 Presentation of the ECOWAS CET
3.2.1 Objectives of the ECOWAS CET
559. The ECOWAS CET, through the harmonisation of customs duties and taxes of equivalent effect at
the borders of Member States, has the following major objectives:
- to deepen regional economic integration: Customs Union, platform conducive to the
development of the ECOWAS Common Trade Policy and regional trade negotiations such as
the Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) between West Africa and the European Union;
- to boost regional productive capacity and investment;
- to consolidate the regional market.
560. With the establishment and the implementation of the ECOWAS CET, our region is on the
threshold of a Customs Union. The customs union will be complete when the region harmonises
customs procedures in order to implement free circulation.
3.2.2 International requirements
561. The CET was established taking into account the requirements of the Harmonised System of the
World Customs Organisation (WCO) and those of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) relating to
Regional Trade Agreements (Article 24 of the GATT).
3.2.3 Structure of the ECOWAS CET
562. Decision A/DEC.17/01/06 of 12 January 2006 adopting the ECOWAS Common External Tariff,
together with its amendment Supplementary Act A/SA.1/06/09 of 22 June 2009, shows the
structure of the CET as follows:
 a Tariff and Statistical Nomenclature (TSN), based on the Harmonised Commodity
Description and Coding System (HS) of the World Customs Organisation (WCO) adopted by
the Community;
 A table of Duties and Charges applicable to imported products which includes:
- customs duty (CD);
- Statistical Tax (ST);
- ECOWAS Community Levy (ECOWAS CL)).
563. Trade defence measures if necessary can generate additional that may affect the final price of
products imported into the Community from third countries.
564. The statistical tax rate is fixed at 1% applicable indifferently to all imported products, exempted or
not.
565. The tax base for the application of the Common External Tariff is Ad Valorem.
566. The products in the Tariff and Statistical Nomenclature were divided into four (4) categories
shown as follows, and reflecting those of the UEMOA CET:
- Category 0: at the rate of 0%: essential social goods.
- Category 1: at the rate of 5%: goods of primary necessity, basic raw materials, capital
goods, specific inputs;
- Category 2: at the rate of 10%: inputs and intermediate goods;
- Category 3: at the rate of 20%: final consumption goods.

567. The list of goods making up each category was to be adopted through the Council of Ministers
Regulation on the proposal of the relevant Technical Committee.
568. To guide work and discussions among Member States on the categorisation of products between
the different tariff bands of the ECOWAS CET and to discuss other matters relating to the
implementation of the instrument, the 29th Authority of Heads of State and Government approved
in Niamey by Resolution A/DEC.14/01/06 of 12 January 2006, the creation of an ECOWAS-UEMOA
Joint Committee on the management of the ECOWAS Common External Tariff (CETJC).
569. The ECOWAS-UEMOA Joint Committee on the management of the ECOWAS CET, comprising
experts from Member States and UEMOA and ECOWAS Commissions adopted a roadmap to
complete the work and meetings on the ECOWAS CET and to submit for thorough analysis and
discussion all the requests made by Member States as well as requests from the departments in
charge of regional sectoral policies of both institutions (agriculture, industry, health, energy, etc.).
570. The objective of the Joint Committee is to advise UEMOA and ECOWAS Commissions on all
matters relating to the management and monitoring of the ECOWAS CET. To that end, it is
approached by the two Commissions concerning any project related to the categorisation of goods
in the tariff or the import duties and charges included in the ECOWAS CET.
571. The Committee takes its decisions by consensus. The Committee has made it possible for the
participatory process to be the driving force of the development process of the ECOWAS CET.
572. The ECOWAS CET expected to start on 1st January 2008 could not meet the deadline for several
reasons but mainly because a Member State requested that a fifth category at the rate of 50% be
introduced into the ECOWAS CET to enable it protect its economic sector. The highest rate of the
ECOWAS CET, as provided for by Decision A/DEC.17/01/06 of 12 January 2006, was 20%.
573. The new problem required in-depth studies by the ECOWAS Commission and several meetings of
the Joint Technical Committee to assess the impact of the introduction of the 5th tariff band. The
results of the analyses showed that the 50% rate was excessive and that a rate of 35% would be
enough to protect vulnerable industrial sectors.
574. At the end of the process, the 36th ordinary session of the Authority of Heads of State and
Government of 22 June 2009 approved in Abuja the Supplementary Act A/SA.1/06/09 amending
Decision A/DEC.17/01/06 of 12 January 2006 and establishing the ECOWAS Common External
Tariff focusing on the creation of a 5th tariff band at 35%. The higher category (No. 4) of the
ECOWAS CET is referred to as "specific goods for economic development".
To that end, Regulation C/REG.1/06/13 of 21 June 2013 defines the list of goods which make up
the categories of the tariff and statistical nomenclature of the ECOWAS Common External Tariff
(CET); the structure of the CET is as follows:

3.2.4 CET, Instrument for the implementation of sectoral policies
- CET and the agricultural sector
575. The agricultural sector is very important in the economy of West African States. It weighs between
20-40 percent of the Gross Domestic Product of many States and contributes strongly to the
export revenues of the States. In that regard, the ECOWAS common agricultural policy main
guidelines were reflected in the regional tariff.
576. Thus, agricultural seeds, livestock and agricultural capital goods (farm tractors and other farm
machinery) are imported into the region at a rate of 5%. The import duty for agricultural inputs
such as urea and superphosphates (chapter 31) is 0% to facilitate the access of agricultural
producers to such goods.
577. However, in order to make regional production competitive, processed agricultural products such
as flour (wheat, corn, chapter 11) are taxed at 20%. Milk imported for retail sales is taxed at 20%
to encourage local production. Live reproductive animals (chapter 1) necessary for the
development of livestock are taxed at 5%. To encourage the production of meat in the sub-region,
imported meat and edible offal (Chapter 2), some meat food products (sausages, hams in Chapter
16) are mostly taxed at 35%.
- CET and the industrial sector
578. The ECOWAS CET is pro-industry. It was developed by taxing imported goods based on their level
of processing. Imported inputs necessary for the production of finished products in the regional
market are classified in category 1 and taxed at 5%. Imported finished industrial goods competing
with regional productions are mostly taxed at 20%. Intermediate products are taxed at 10%. Some
strategic industrial products such as textiles (WAX) manufactured in the region are protected at
the rate of 35%.
579. Machines and equipment as well as transport equipment (chapter 84-89) necessary for
production are mostly taxed at 5% to facilitate their import by operators.
580. On the issue of pharmaceuticals, work is ongoing with the collaboration of the West African Health
Organization (WAHO) to determine the list of drugs manufactured in the region. In that regard, a
survey was conducted in ECOWAS Member States for the development of the list. WAHO in
coordination with ECOWAS Customs Directorate will propose to the management committee of
the CET optimal taxation which will ensure the protection of the regional pharmaceutical industry.
- CET and the social sector
581. The import duty for most drugs and vaccines (Chapter 30), butane (Chapter 27), school textbooks
(Chapter 49), treated mosquito nets (Chapter 67) and solar panels (Chapter 85) is at 0% to
facilitate the access of the people to such products.
3.2.5 Support measures of the ECOWAS CET
582. As part of the package of accompanying measures, the following texts support the
implementation of the CET for products imported into the community from third countries. The
adoption of trade defence measures is derived from the premise that customs duties as listed in
the regional tariff are not always sufficient to provide optimal protection to production sectors.
Thus, ECOWAS has approved the regulations based on the provisions of the World Trade

Organization (WTO) which enable the correction of distortions to trade that could endanger the
production of some goods in the region.
-Regulation C/REG.2/06/13 of 21 June 2013 on the determination of customs value of goods in
ECOWAS
583. The purpose of the Regulation is to enable the application of a uniform customs valuation system
throughout the region, as a basis for ad valorem rates provided for by the CET. The regulation is
based on the WTO agreement on customs valuation. However, in the absence of free circulation in
the Community, access fees were included in customs valuation.
-Regulation C/REG.3/06/13 of 21 June 2013 defining the procedure applicable to inputs which are
more heavily taxed than finished products
584. The purpose of the text is to ensure that inputs used for the production of goods belonging to the
first tariff band (0%) are not more heavily taxed than finished products. The Regulation provides
for temporary admission for inward processing to cover such inputs without penalty charges or
interests arising therefrom.
-Regulation C/REG.4/06/13 of 21 June 2013 on safeguard measures
585. The measures are intended to address any damage or threat thereof to a production sector of the
Community resulting from massive and uncontrolled imports.
-Regulation C/REG.5/06/13 of 21 June 2013 on the imposition of countervailing duties
586. The Regulation is intended to address any damage or threat thereof to a production sector of the
Community as a result of subsidies which imported products would have enjoyed.
-Regulation C/REG.6/06/13 of 21 June 2013 on anti-dumping measures
587. The objective of the Regulation is to address any damage or threat of material damage to
production sectors of the Community as a result of dumped imports. It is intended to mitigate the
effects of dumped products released for consumption in the Community which cause or threaten
to cause damage to an industry or which delay its creation in the Community.
-Regulation C/REG.1/09/13 of 30 September 2013 on Supplementary Protection Measures
588. It introduced some flexibility and is designed to provide additional protection for Community
industries in the initial phase of the application of the CET. The measures are intended to manage,
for a period of five (5) years, the transition to uniform ECOWAS CET.
3.2.6 Transitional period for the implementation of the ECOWAS CET
589. During the transitional period of five (5) years, the ECOWAS Member States may not set aside the
CET except on 3% of tariff lines by applying an import adjustment tax in cases where the rate of
the ECOWAS CET is lower/higher than the duties applied in the Member State concerned before
1st January 2015
590. The ECOWAS Commission shall be notified within a period of thirty (30) days before the
introduction of the measures. The time schedule of the adjustment over the five (5) year period
must be specified in the letter. The purpose of the import adjustment tax is to allow, for a limited
number of tariff lines, a smooth transition to the CET uniform duty rate.

591. Furthermore, within the limit of the 3% of the above-mentioned tariff lines, ECOWAS members
can impose Supplementary Protection Tax in addition to the CET tariff and any import adjustment
tax to a maximum cumulative tariff rate of 70% under the following conditions:
- imports to a Member State at regular tariff rates increased by at least 25% compared to
the three preceding years for which statistics are available; or
- the average import price falls below 80% of the average import price in force during the
three preceding years for which statistics exist; and
- the ECOWAS Commission allows the Supplementary Protection Tax.
592. For the first alternative, tax can be applied for a maximum of two years and the latter for a period
of one year.
593. Downward deviations from the CET are allowed under Regulation C/REG.3/06/13 determining the
Procedure Applicable to Inputs which are more Heavily Taxed than some finished products. In
accordance with Article 2 of the Regulation, inputs for the production of products in category 0
may be imported under a duty suspension scheme and manufactured goods can be released for
internal consumption without duties and penalty interest.
-

Example 1: If printed plastic products (sub-heading 3921 90 20, 20% duty free) are
imported for packaging pharmaceutical products (Chapter 30, duty free) by virtue of Article
2 of this Regulation, the finished product may be released duty free for consumption.
Article 3 of this Regulation envisages facilitation measures for these «inputs» in keeping
with international conventions, Community texts and international rights. This rule is
understandable because the importation and processing of heavily taxed inputs released
for consumption and taxing manufactured products at the rate of finished (customscontrolled production) are permissible if the finished product falls under category 1 or 2
because the revised Kyoto Convention does not restrict this customs procedure to dutyfree goods.

-

Example 2: If printed woven cotton fabrics (sub-heading 5209 51, 35% duty rate) are
imported for the production of headbands (heading 6507, 10% duty rate), why not use this
procedure to encourage local production??

3.3 PROGRESS ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ECOWAS CET
3.3.1 Status of implementation of the ECOWAS CET
594. As at 31st October 2016, the status of implementation of the ECOWAS CET is as follows:
- Ten (10) of the fifteen (15) Member States (Benin, Burkina Faso, Cote d’Ivoire, Ghana,
Guinea Bissau, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Togo) are applying the ECOWAS CET while it is
not being implemented in the five others for various reasons;
- Guinea, Gambia, Liberia and Sierra Leone have announced that measures are underway to
commence the implementation of the CET from 1st January 2017;
- ECOWAS will provide adequate support for Cape Verde in 2017 to ensure its transition
towards the ECOWAS CET.
595. As at today, Cote d’Ivoire, Nigeria, Ghana, Senegal and Burkina Faso are applying supplementary
protection measures.

3.3.2 Evaluation of the implementation of the ECOWAS CET
596. In approving the CET and its related regulations, the ECOWAS Council of Ministers instructed the
Commission to present it with regular reports on the implementation of the CET. In that regard,
the Commission organized in August 2015 and June/July 2016 visits to Member States with the
triple objective of:
- Assessing the implementation of the CET;
- Identifying challenges in the implementation process;
- Proposing measures to address these challenges.
597. At the end of the two assessment missions, the status of implementation of the ECOWAS CET in
Member Status indicated below was established and the following observations made:
- Sensitisation and trainings efforts on the CET were inadequate. A good number of
stakeholders had very little knowledge of the CET;
- Poor capacity of certain administrations hindered the take-off of the CET;
- In the countries that the implementation of the CET commenced, customs duties have
improved significantly thus dispelling the negative apprehensions about the impact of the
CET on the West African economies.
- The ECOWAS CET has become an instrument of public finance in Member States and it
has introduced discipline in fiscal policy.
3.3.3 ECOWAS CET and consolidation of the regional market
598. ECOWAS is in the process of establishing a West African common market with a common external
tariff and a common trade policy. Many provisions of the ECOWAS Treaty are very important for
the development of West Africa. These include:
- The development of agriculture and food security thanks to the liberalisation of inputs and
agricultural equipment, harmonisation of food security policies and protection of
agricultural exports on the international market;
- A CET, based on a common nomenclature to ensure that customs procedures are
transparent, easily tracked and reduce delays at the border;
- The free movement of goods in consonance with Articles 38 (Community Tariff Treatment)
and 40 (Fiscal Charges and Internal Taxation). There is the need to implement and comply
with these articles relating to intra-ECOWAS trade to ensure the smooth functioning of the
Common External Tariff, which protects the regional market from foreign competition.
599. If these conditions for an effective customs union are not fully implemented, West Africa would
continue to suffer from trade diversion, smuggling and inefficient collection of fiscal revenue.
3.4 CHALLENGES OF THE ECOWAS CET
3.4.1 The issue of renegotiating tariff concessions
600. All ECOWAS Member States are members of the World Trade Organisation (WTO). As members,
they have made tariff concessions as part of their WTO obligations within the framework of the
Multilateral Trade System (MTS). The entry into force of the CET therefore implies that ECOWAS
Member States are obliged to renegotiate their tariff concessions at the WTO because by
implementing the CET they may have violated their commitments.
601. The ECOWAS and UEMOA Commissions have commenced a technical and legal assessment
mission to the WTO, Permanent Missions of Member States in Geneva, Switzerland and other
organisations. This has enabled them to identify appropriate actions with a view to renegotiating
their tariff concessions during the 2015-2017 cycle. The problems were identified and proposals

made; a regional road map has been prepared taking due account of steps to be taken in order to
conclude the renegotiations. It is in this regard that Member States were requested to contact the
WTO Secretariat to reserve their rights as provided by Article XXVIII, paragraph 5, of GATT 1994.
Eleven (11) Member States have complied with this directive. It should be pointed out that the
Joint ECOWAS/UEMOA Joint Management Committee on the ECOWAS CET has expressed its
desire for the renegotiations to be done in group.
602. Following the request by ECOWAS Member States, the WTO has done a comparison of the
concessions of these members with the 20 March 2013 edition of the ECOWAS Common External
Tariff
603. The transposed bound duties were compared with the ECOWAS CET at the HS sub-heading (6-digit
HS codes) level. The average bound tariffs, minimum and maximum rates are compared with the
average ECOWAS CET, at the minimum and maximum rates and termed as possible contraventions
when higher. These are indicative and should be interpreted with care as they refer to HS subheading and may relate to one or several tariff lines.
604. With the exception of Cape Verde, where certain concessions have one more year to run (ex.
2013, 2014, 2016 and 2018, ECOWAS Member States have fully implemented their concessions.
For 2018, 29 lines are involved). There is the likelihood that about 9 countries may violate their
commitments and these involved 3 to 889 HS sub-headings (see Table 1 below). The worst cases
of contraventions have been observed on industrial products (NAMA). Machinery, textiles and
clothing are some of the tariff lines recording the highest cases of default. In agriculture, the
chapter on meat recorded the highest number of violations.

605. In the light of the foregoing, the ECOWAS Commission in collaboration with WTO organised a
training workshop in Dakar from 18 to 20 May 2016 on the renegotiation of tariff concessions for
Member States as well as a meeting of ECOWAS Experts on renegotiations of tariff concessions
also in Dakar, from 23 to 25 May 2016. The meetings were aimed at discussing the link between
the ECOWAS Common External Tariff and Member States’ obligations to the WTO. It was also to

familiarize the participants with the various stages of the procedures for modifying these
commitments.
606. Furthermore, from 2017, the Commission and Member States should commence, at the WTO in
Geneva renegotiating violations with third countries indicated in the table above. A regional
strategy should be defined to ensure that trade compensations that may be required of the region
by our primary trade partners do not negatively affect our regional trade or development policies.
3.4.2 The CET and establishment of an ECOWAS regional and national mechanism for the
implementation of trade defence measures.
607. Apart from the final CET structure, ECOWAS has also adopted the prescribed regulations
introducing the trade defence and supplementary protection measures to support the
implementation of the CET regarding products imported into the Community from third countries.
608. There are no administrative structures in place in ECOWAS nor in Member States to investigate
dumping, subsidies and other adverse practices; therefore, it is difficult, in practice, to address
these complaints and impose additional duties.
609. ECOWAS should therefore consider establishing a mechanism in charge of requests for the
application of antidumping, countervailing and safeguard measures. The administrative structures
should also be involved in conducting the necessary investigations to enable ECOWAS Commission
fulfil its obligations as prescribed by law.
3.4.3 CET and entry into force of the next revision of the HS (HS 2017)
610. The Preamble to the International Convention on Harmonised Commodity Description and Coding
System (HS) underscored the importance of ensuring that the revision of the Harmonised System
is determined by developments in technology and patterns of international trade as well as
environmental and social factors. In that regard, the Harmonised System has been subjected to a
revision every five (5) years to sustain its relevance in international trade.
611. The next version of HS Nomenclature will enter into force on 1st January 2017. As members of the
World Customs Organization (WCO), ECOWAS countries are obliged to implement this new
version.
612. ECOWAS should put in place measures to ensure not only its participation in the on-going
discussions within the HS Committee in Brussels at the World Customs Organisation but also
review the CET as may be required to align it with the latest version of the Harmonised System
under implementation.
3.4.4 CET and the harmonisation of exemptions of customs duties
613. Regulation C/REG.1/06/13 of 21 June 2013 relating to the CET does not specify if the exemptions
applied by ECOWAS Member States on inputs and equipment in specific agricultural and industrial
sectors can be sustained and if they apply only to the 5-year transition period.
614. The period of transition should therefore be used in elaborating binding Community provisions on
duty exemptions regarding the harmonisation of relevant procedures and conditions for granting
these exemptions

3.4.5 Monitoring/evaluation mechanism for the implementation of ECOWAS CET
615. Apart from regular assessment missions on the implementation of the CET in Member States,
there is no monitoring/evaluation mechanism in place at the moment. Additional efforts need to
be made to establish such an instrument for an effective monitoring of the CET.
3.5 PERSPECTIVES AND PROSPECTS OF THE ECOWAS CET
3.5.1 Deepening regional integration: coordination of fiscal and trade policies
616. By adopting the CET, ECOWAS has taken another major step for the economic integration of West
African States. More than ever before, there is the need for regional coordination of economic,
trade and customs policies. National trade policies would gradually be replaced by a common
trade policy. It would no longer be possible to conclude free trade agreements between an
ECOWAS Member State and a third country. This obliges Member States to resort to the regional
mechanism before embarking on any national policy reform.
617. In the light of the foregoing, it is evident that Member States, with ECOWAS support and
supervision are obliged to meet on a regular basis at the regional level to arrive at a consensus on
how to implement national trade measures or modify the CET in order to meet sectoral policy
issues.
618. With the implementation of the CET, Member States are compelled to intensify efforts on their
customs reforms particularly the harmonisation and simplification of customs procedures and
operations for compliance with international standards (Revised Kyoto Convention, Trade
Facilitation Agreement, etc.). In addition, the CET is hastening the pace of adopting a Community
Customs Code, which will provide another platform for Member States to reconcile customs
administrations while strengthening cooperation and partnership with the private sector.
619. The implementation of the free circulation which envisages the attainment of the full customs
union is the next major step in the series of measures relating to the adoption of the CET. The free
circulation involves the abolition of customs barriers within the Community. In that regard, once
goods have been cleared at any Community border, it may be moved within the Community
territory and across all ECOWAS Member States without being subjected to further customs
formalities (as is the case with the European Union).
3.5.2 Trade negotiation instrument
620. The adoption of the CET has given ECOWAS, as a single customs territory, the capacity of signing
trade agreements with other third countries. Even if the revised Treaty envisages this possibility
(Article 83 of the Revised Treaty), it had not been possible for ECOWAS to sign a trade agreement
with another party in the world because that partner would have been presented with fifteen (15)
national tariffs.
621. The CET ensures the standardisation of customs and import duties of the fifteen (15) Member
States. ECOWAS has become a single customs territory with a Community border which will
enable the Community to conclude free trade agreements with third countries. These types of
agreement are negotiated on the basis of customs duties, involving each party giving the other
party concessions in the form of reducing/eliminating customs duties on foreign trade goods. The
CET is the ideal ECOWAS instrument for conducting this negotiation with other entities.
622. In effect, the Economic Partnership Agreements between ECOWAS and the European Union were
signed based on the CET. The trade liberalisation referred to in the EPA will be carried out using

the CET. The CET would also serve as the basis for the forthcoming ECOWAS trade agreement
negotiations with China and Turkey.
CONCLUSION
623. The implementation of the CET by all Member States is a major step towards the consolidation of
the regional market, boosting the regional production and investment capacity, and deepening
economic integration in West Africa.
624. The ECOWAS Common External Tariff (CET) was adopted in 2006 as an engine for the completion
of the Customs Union and the creation of a Common Market in West Africa.
625. The CET offers an enormous potential for achieving economic integration in West Africa.
626. The CET is a catalyst and a manifestation of the regional integration process. Its implementation
would open the path for the establishment of new instruments that would oblige Member States
to strengthen cooperation and old their individual national interests into common interests.
627. It is therefore necessary that the ECOWAS CET is well known and owned by the public in general
and economic operators of the West African region in particular.

CHAPTER IV: ACTIVITIES OF OTHER COMMUNITY INSTITUTIONS
4.1

THE ECOWAS PARLIAMENT

628. The Third Legislature of the ECOWAS Parliament ended on 10th August 2015 while the Fourth
Legislature was inaugurated on 5th February, 2016. Consequently, there was a period of lull in the
Parliament, thereby no parliamentary activities took place. Furthermore, the end of the Third
Legislature also coincided with the end period of the implementation of the Parliament’s Strategic
Plan.
 Inaugural Session
629. The Inaugural Session of the Parliament took place in Abuja, from 5 th to 9th February, 2016. During
the said Session, the Parliament elected a new Speaker, in the person of His Excellency,
Moustapha Cissé Lo of the Republic of Senegal. His election was sequel to the decision of the
ECOWAS Authority of Heads of State and Government, to allocate the position of the Speaker of
Parliament to the Republic of Senegal, based on alphabetical order of Member States. In addition,
the Parliament elected Four Deputy Speakers to constitute the Bureau.
630. The Parliament used the opportunity provided by the Inaugural Session to adopt the Rules of
Procedure of the Fourth Legislature. It also constituted the membership of the Thirteen Standing
Committees and elected the bureaux of each of the Committees. By this development, all the
structures of the Parliament, notably; the Bureau, Conference of Bureaux and the Standing
Committees, were reconstituted.
 The Extra Ordinary Session
631. The Parliament held an Extra Ordinary Session in Abuja, from 11th to 15th April, 2016. The main
subject before the Extra Ordinary Session was, the consideration and adoption of the draft
Strategic Plan (2016-2020) of the Parliament and the Activity Plan for the Legislature. The Extra
Ordinary Session also addressed the issues concerning the draft Supplementary Act on the
Enhancement of the Powers of the ECOWAS Parliament.
632. The Strategic Plan of the Parliament (2016-2020), was derived from the strategic orientation of the
Community Strategic Framework (CSF). The Parliament is to operate its activities under Goal 3 of
the CSF. This Goal aims at deepening the process of political cohesion and participation. This is in
line with the core mandate of the Parliament, which is to promote popular participation in
community issues and provide a voice for the people. The Parliament adopted the following
objectives:
- Enhance the participation and representation of the entire population in the decision making
process of the community;
- Strengthen the institutional role and powers of the ECOWAS Parliament;
- Contribute towards peace, security, good governance and human rights; and
- Promote relations with Community Institutions, National Parliaments, Inter-Parliamentary
bodies and Partner Organisations.
633. Concerning the project on the Enhancement of Powers of the Parliament, Members resolved to
embark on wide consultation and advocacy, especially among Member States. Parliament also
agreed to reconsider certain provisions contained in the draft Act and review them, in an attempt
to facilitate consensus and early adoption.

 The Inter-Parliamentary Union
634. The ECOWAS Parliament participated at the 134th General Assembly of the Inter-Parliamentary
Union (IPU) and Related Meetings, held from 19th to 23rd March, 2016, in Lusaka, Zambia. The
theme of the Assembly was the Rejuvenation of Democracy to encourage youth participation.
635. At the end of deliberations, a Resolution was adopted with the following highlights:
- Increase the presence of youths in our Parliament, by establishing a quota system and
reviewing the legal age restriction for contesting elections;
- Entrust key positions to young parliamentarians, by making them examples for other youths
to emulate;
- Reform the parliamentary process so as to make them more receptive (accessible) to youths;
and
- Facilitate effective participation of young parliamentarians at international debates and fora.
 Appointment of a new set of Management Staff
636. During the period under review, a new set of Management Staff was appointed to run the affairs
of the General Secretariat of the Parliament. Earlier in 2015, advertisements for the positions of
the Secretary General D2, the Director of Administration and Finance D1 and the Director of
Parliamentary Affairs and Research D1 for the ECOWAS Parliament were published. This was done
in accordance with the ECOWAS Staff Regulations. Subsequently, interviews were conducted and
the following candidates were successful and therefore appointed, as follows:
- Dr. Nelson Magbagbeola - Secretary General
- Mr. K. Bertin Some
- Director of Parliamentary Affairs and Research
- Mrs. Anna Jagne
- Director of Administration and Finance
637. The Secretary General assumed duty on 11th February, 2016, while the two Directors assumed
duty on 1st April, 2016.
 2016 Ordinary Sessions of Parliament
638. As it is statutory, the 2016 First Ordinary Session of the Parliament took place from 16 – 31st May,
2016. During the Session, the Standing Committees of the Parliament were officially inaugurated,
with their membership formally confirmed at plenary. Furthermore, the Parliament established an
Adhoc Committee to consider and review the draft Supplementary Act on the Enhancement of
Powers of the Parliament. The Adhoc Committee was mandated to drop all provisions in the draft
Supplementary Act considered contentious. In the meantime, the President of the ECOWAS
Commission had put in place an Inter-Institutional Technical Committee to review the draft Act. As
is customary with every Ordinary Session, the Parliament considered the Activity Report of the
President of the ECOWAS Commission, as well as Country Reports from each National delegation.
639. In addition, a seminar on “Harmonizing Synergies for Parliamentary Action against Large- Scale
Child Trafficking and Child Labour” was organised on 25th and 26th May, 2016. The Regional
Seminar was co-organised by the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU), International Labour
Organisation (ILO) and the ECOWAS Parliament.
640. The 2016 Second Ordinary Session was held from 22nd September to 7th October, 2016. During the
Session, the Parliament considered and adopted the report of the Adhoc Committee that prepared
the 2017 budget. Similarly, the Adhoc Committee on the Enhancement of Powers of the
Parliament, considered and adopted the recommendations of the Inter-Institutional Committee, in
which some aspects of the draft Act considered contentious were dropped. The Adhoc Committee

also considered and adopted the proposed roadmap for adopting the draft Supplementary Act.
Report of the Ad-hoc Committee was adopted by the Plenary. The Second Ordinary Session also
considered the Activity Report of the President of the ECOWAS Commission and Country Reports
from each of the National Delegations.
641. On the side-lines of the Session, the Parliament, in conjunction with the United Nations High
Commission for Refugees (UNHCR), organised a workshop for all Members of Parliament on the
theme “The Role of Parliamentarians in Addressing Statelessness and Internal Displacement
Challenges in ECOWAS sub-region.” At the end of the workshop, the following recommendations
were made:
a. ECOWAS Members of Parliament undertake to:
- work together and tirelessly for the promotion of the Kampala Convention for its
ratification and transformation into an internal positive law to the 15 Community
Member States; and
- work relentlessly for the ratification, by the few Member States that have not yet
done so, of the 28 September 1954 Convention relating to the status of Stateless
Persons as well as the 30 August 1961 Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness
to make ECOWAS the pioneer region in this area.
b. Adopt, for that purpose, a 2016/2017 joint action plan, particularly including:
- fact-finding missions with logistical support from the United Nations High Commission
for Refugees (UNHCR) on the conditions of refugees and Internally Displaced Persons
(IDPs), starting in particular by the sites of the IDPs and refugees’ camps of NorthEastern Nigeria and in Niger;
- an inter-parliamentary regional workshop on the status of implementation of
international conventions and the other instruments at the African and regional
levels, relating to Statelessness, refugees and displaced persons.
c. Urge the Office of Representation of the UNHCR accredited to ECOWAS and the Bureau of
the Joint Committee on: Human Rights and Political Affairs, Peace and Security and the
African Peer Review Mechanism (APRM) to do all they can to monitor the implementation
of the joint action plan.
d. Appeal to all players in the region involved in the protection and promotion of Human
Rights to support the implementation of the said plan.
 Delocalised Committee Meetings
642. As a result of paucity of funds, Delocalised Committee meetings, scheduled for the earlier part of
the year, could not hold. Consequently, the Committee meetings were rescheduled to hold in the
last quarter of the year, with the following schedule:
- The meeting of the Joint Committee on Communication & Information Technology;
Agriculture, Environment, Water Resources & Sustainable Development; Infrastructure,
Energy, Mines & Industry; Education, Science & Technology; Heath & Social Services, on
the theme, “ The Process of revision of the Regional and National Agriculture Investment

COMMUNITY COURT OF JUSTICE

643. In the discharge of its four-fold mandate, the ECOWAS Court of Justice has, through a combination
of judicial rigour, collaboration with Member States, the Commission and partners, strengthened
its value as an important instrument for deepening the culture of democracy, good governance
and human rights in the ECOWAS sub-region. This is exemplified by the progressive increase in the
number of cases filed before the Court which stood at 36 between January and October 2016, a
period during which the Court held 75 sessions, delivered 25 judgements and 8 rulings at its
headquarters.
644. Eleven other cases were heard at the 2016 External Court Session held in Cote d’Ivoire during
which judgements were rendered in six of the cases. External sessions are annual activities of the
Court rotated among Member States designed as a flag-showing opportunity, but critically
intended as a window for citizens to appreciate the Court and engage with stakeholders in order
to familiarize them with its operations to enhance the Courts’ visibility and utility as an important
recourse, particularly on the issue of human rights which accounts for the preponderance of its
cases.
645. Although it held more sessions (91) in the corresponding period for 2015, there was a marginal
increase in the number of judgements for the corresponding period in 2016 from 23 to 25 in 2016.
646. On the margin of the session in Abidjan, the Court inaugurated the West African Jurists Association
(WAJA), the culmination of years of efforts by the Court to deliver on this platform through which
it will engage with Judges and Jurists as critical stakeholders in the sub-regional effort to develop
synergy in the delivery of justice and the enthronement of a region-wide regime of respect for the
rule of law. Moreover, the session enabled the Court to undertake the complementary activity of a
radio and sensitization programme in Abidjan, one of the two such outings undertaken in 2016,
with the first held in March in Dakar, Senegal.
647. In order to reduce the knowledge gap about the Court in Member States, the Court is engaged in a
capacity building initiative for judges and magistrates of the Member States that is intended to
acquaint them with the specificities of the Court, which is particularly useful for those that might
appear before the Court. The only such programme allowed within the constraints of the budget
for 2016 has been scheduled for Ghana in November.
648. While the Court has coped admirably with the progressive increase in the number of cases filed by
citizens, it has sought to improve its internal arrangements for the management of cases in
response to the dynamics of the environment and for greater efficiency in the delivery of justice.
Consequently, it initiated the process for updating its practice directions on case management as
well as harmonizing its basic texts to be finalized within the last quarter of 2016. As part of the
preparatory process, the 2016 annual judges and judicial retreat of the Court focused on the
theme “Improving the Case Management System of the Court” in order to sign post issues that
needed to be addressed for a more efficient case management system.
 Stakeholder Sensitisation, Mobilisation and Advocacy
649. An effective public information support is indispensable for ensuring citizen and stakeholder
sensitization, mobilization and advocacy in order to attract critical stakeholder support which is
decisive for citizen utilization of the Court and part of the justification for Member States support.
650. Beside the radio and television campaigns that was only implemented in two Member States in
2016 due to budgetary constraints, the Court also relied on a variety of information tools, mainly
press releases, which recorded a remarkable increase this year due, mainly, to the tweaking of the

emphasis with the intensive coverage of Court sessions, the publication of a monthly newsletter
and special activities that involve local journalists. The Court also worked on updating its website
to make it more user-friendly and improve its aesthetics while deploying social media to leverage
the possibilities offered by platforms to improve access to information on the Court and citizen
engagement.
651. In this regard, more than 50 local journalists covered various activities of the Court including Court
sessions and special events reflecting the increasing media interest in the Court, locally and
internationally. In statistical terms, the Court issued more than 30 press releases during the period
which were circulated to the local, regional and international press as well as uploaded on the
website. Moreover, a process was initiated for the electronic distribution of the monthly
newsletter internally and to partners as well as members of the diplomatic community. As an
ancillary to this, the Court hosted four press conferences on the margins of various programmes in
Member States.
652. In order to expand the scope of the Court’s citizen awareness, advocacy and mobilization
campaign, the Court has resuscitated the bi-annual Court bulletin through which it engages with
its stakeholders on various issues affecting the Court. The bulletin provides a policy platform for
the robust discussion of the mandate of the Court, its rich jurisprudence, the vexed issue of the
implementation of its decisions and the discussion of International Human Rights Law. The first
edition of the revitalized journal is scheduled to be published by the last quarter of 2016.
 Library and Documentation
653. A well-equipped library is an indispensable resource for the judiciary. In this regard, the Court
continues to improve the capacity of its library to provide reference support for staff through the
procurement of books, periodicals and documents. The library has painstakingly accumulated a
diverse inventory of 4,000 reference materials, mainly books, periodicals and other publications in
the three Community languages that will assist the Court in the discharge of its mandate(s). The
operations of the library are also being computerized to improve access for staff and citizens in
anticipation of a future when it would be opened to the public.
 Human Resources and Capacity Building
654. The effectiveness of the Court is correlated to the quality and quantity of its human and material
capacity. In recognition of this imperative, the Court had elaborated outstanding professional and
other level positions that needed to be filled in order to capacitate it for better service delivery.
Consequently, it identified fourteen professional positions which were forwarded to the
Commission which coordinates recruitment based on the decision of the Council of Ministers.
655. However, as at 30th September 2016 only three (3) managerial positions namely: Director of
Administration and Finance, Director of Research, Communication and Documentation as well as
Deputy Chief Registrar, were processed and filled. These officials have since April 2016 assumed
duty, thus strengthening the strategic level capacity of the Court. It is anticipated that the position
of Registrar which became vacant with the elevation of the previous occupant to the post of
Deputy Chief Registrar, would be filled before the end of the year in order to strengthen the
Registry which is at the core of the mandate of the Court.
 finance
656. For sometime the court has had to operate on a shoestring, forcing management to resolve at a
time to concentrate on core issues based on the lean finances of the Court, a manifestation of the
difficult financial situation confronting the entire Community. As an institution which by its nature

is constrained to solely rely on the Community levy, with a very narrow possibility of alternative
resources from partners, the Court was particularly hit with a Community budget process that
emphasized across-the- board cuts in 2015, without due regard to the peculiarities of the
Institutions, especially, the Court.
657. However, 2016 has marked a significant turnaround in the funding of the Court with total income
of UA9, 505,132 for the period January- September representing 78.16 per cent. For the last
quarter, we anticipate the receipt of UA2, 656,544 representing another 21.84 per cent. But for
the 10 per cent across the board reduction in 2015, the Court would have been in better financial
health as it is still stuttering from the collateral damage inflicted on staff welfare and other issues.
658. On the expenditure front, out of a total expenditure budget of UA 12,161,676 for the year 2016,
UA 6,416,353 had been committed at the end of September, representing 62.76% of the budget.
This was a marked improvement in implementation compared to the 43.28% recorded for the
corresponding period in 2105. It is projected that the last quarter expenditure would amount to
UA2, 432,335 which is 20% of the budget.
659. Administration and staff expenses constituted about 93.33% of the expenditure, with the
organization of the West African Judges conference, the external Court session, the Judicial and
budget retreats and equipping the Court accounting formed the bulk of the expenditure for 2016.
 Collaboration
660. In 2016 the Court participated in various fora organized mostly by Community institutions,
international organisations and partners mainly in Addis Ababa, Dakar, Geneva, Nairobi, Praia,
Arusha, Kigali, and Cotonou. In order to operationalize the MOU signed with the UNHCR in 2015, a
work plan has been agreed with the UNHCR under which two capacity building seminars for staff
of both institutions on issues of common interest will take place during the last quarter of 2016.
661. The Court is also collaborating with GIABA to address the challenges of money laundering and
financing of terrorism. It is within this context that the Director General of GIABA delivered the
Guest Keynote Speech at the opening of the 2016/2017 legal year where he spoke on “The role of
the ECOWAS Community Court of Justice in the fight against money laundering and financing of
terrorism within the West African sub region: A perspective from GIABA”. Remarkably, by
delivering the speech, he entered into the history books as the first Community Staff to deliver the
guest speech in the history of the Court.
662. The Court is also exploring the possibilities of other partnerships in 2016 and beyond in support of
its activities without compromising its mandate, jurisprudence and independence.
 Miscelleneous
663. One of the profound developments for 2016 in the Court was the election, in June, of the first
male President of the Court in the person of Honorable Justice Jerome Traore from Burkina Faso.
He was elected by his peers along with Honorable Justice Micah Wilkins Wright from Liberia as
Vice President and Honorable Justice Hameye-Foune Mahalmadane from Mali as the Dean.
 Challenges
664. The delay in translation of Court processes is posing a very serious threat for the Court because
the Translators cannot cope with the large volume of court process requiring translation. The
result is inordinate delay in translation of Court processes which in turn causes delay in the
hearing of cases. Therefore, there is a need to address the problem of insufficient Translators in
the three working languages of the Community.

665. The inadequacy of office space remains a major challenge for the Court. The institution is
therefore encouraged by the recent steps taken by the Government of the Federal Republic of
Nigeria, working with the Court, to discharge its Treaty obligation towards the expedited
resolution of the problem.
 Prospects
666. Other activities anticipated to be concluded before the end of the year include the adoption of the
Court’s 2016/2020 strategic action plan, its practice direction and a workshop towards the review
and harmonization of its basic texts.

essential equipment to the five weakest FIUs in GIABA member States under the joint GIABAEuropean Union Project (SAMWA), October – December, 2016, Guinea, Guinea Bissau, Liberia,
Sierra Leone, The Gambia; Typologies study on “AML and Extraction Industries in West Africa” for

690. The following activities are also planned for the year, Strengthening Human Resource Capacities

Capacity Building on Economic and Financial Crimes for Judges, December 13 – 15, 2016, AbujaNigeria.
691. It should be recalled that the cardinal ambition of the Strategic plan is to make GIABA a modern
and model institution that is a reflection of ECOWAS's ambitions to fight against transnational
organised crime in general, and money laundering, terrorism and its financing in particular.
Consequently, the expertise gained during its activities and the quality of technical assistance
provided to member States primarily helped prepare them for the second round of the Mutual
Evaluation process started in September 2016 with Ghana.
692. In view of the significant deficiencies in our countries' AML/CFT regimes, and the new
requirements of the evaluation process linked to strict compliance with internationally-accepted
technical compliance and effectiveness standards, GIABA's excellent expertise and the
effectiveness of its technical assistance to key players in the AML/CFT chain should be strongly
encouraged and supported through sufficient budget allocations to allow it meet in real time and
as effectively as possible ECOWAS's high expectations in terms of consolidating overall security
and good governance within its zone.

701. With regard to approvals during the first three (3) quarters of the year under review, the Board of
Directors approved the financing of two projects amounting to UA 23.4 million (USD 32.5 million).
The projects are:
- Project to set up a clinker production plant at Sougueta, by Diamond Cement, in the
Republic of Guinea;
- Project to facilitate the granting of loans to Ghana Home Loans Ltd, an establishment that
gives mortgage loans in the Republic of Ghana.
702. The new commitments signed during the period under review, amounted to UA 14.8 million (USD
20.6 million), for three (3) loan agreements for projects in Ghana, Cote d’Ivoire and Togo. These
financing are essentially dedicated to the funding of road infrastructure in Cote d’Ivoire and in
Togo. They are:
- Project for the development and upgrading of the national highway no 17 Stretch
Katchamba-Sabori (60km), in Togo in the amount of FCFA 2.98 billion (USD 5 million) ;

establishment that gives mortage loans in the Republic of Ghana.
-

Status of Commitments

703. As at 31st August, 2016, the net cumulative commitments of the Bank to Member States stood at
UA 905 million for 135 active projects compared to UA 928.1 million for 138 projects as at
December 31, 2015, representing a fall of 2.5 %. This decline in the net cumulative commitments is
essentially on account of matured projects, cancelled projects, and projects for which the
promoters could not meet the conditions precedent for first disbursement.
704. As indicated in the chart below, after twelve (12) years of operation, the Bank has been able to
increase its level of net cumulative commitments from UA 121 million in 2004 to UA 905 million as
at 31st August, 2016.

 COOPERATION AND MOBILISATION OF RESOURCES
705. The implementation of cooperation, partnership and resource mobilisation activities constitute an
important component of EBID strategic development. It is carried out with the double objective of
strengthening its visibility within the Community and with development partners, and having
adequate resources to give the necessary impetus to the financing of its activities, thus ensuring
its profitability as well as its sustainability.
- Cooperation and Partnership
• AfDB/FAPA Technical Assistance Programme
706. In the area of partnership and cooperation, the main actions embarked upon during the course of
2016 essentially centered around the implementation of the technical assistance programme
signed with the African Development Bank (AfDB), on 4th March, 2013, financed by a grant from
the Fund for the Support of the African Private Sector (FAPA) for an amount of USD 950,400. The
progamme consists of six (6) components, namely:
-

Study on Visibility and Positioning of the Bank;

-

Strengthening of Human Capital;

-

Pricing Policy Model;

-

Private Sector Intervention Strategy

-

Resource Mobilisation Strategy; and

-

Strengthening Legal Department of the Bank

707. As at the end of September 2016, all the contracts had been signed with all the service providers
selected. The programme will come to an end on 31st December, 2016.
•

Cooperation with the ECOWAS Commission

708. Within the framework of strengthening ties between the two sister institutions, EBID participated
in several meetings organised by the ECOWAS Commission, notably those related to the
preparation of the high level round table of donors scheduled for the first quarter of 2017 in
Abidjan, for the mobilisation of resources intended to finance the ECOWAS Community
Development Programme (CDP).

Member States to pay up capital subscription arrears. During the period under review, he paid
courtesy calls on the Presidents of Nigeria, Cote d’Ivoire and Ghana. The Bank received five (5)
payments in the total amount of UA 10, 221, 936, reducing the total amount of arrears from UA
185 775 066 at the end of December 2015 to UA 175 553 130 on 30th September 2016,
representing 44.7 % of the called up capital. To date, only five countries (Benin, Burkina Faso,
Guinea, Mali and Niger) have paid up the first and second tranches of their called up capital.

711. With respect to borrowings, discussions were held with several partners, notably, Great Joint
International / African Network Finance and Development, the China Development Bank, the
OPEC Fund for International Development (OFID), the Banque Marocaine du Commerce Extérieur
(BMCE), Exim bank India, etc. Discussions are far advanced with the China Development Bank for
a line of credit in the amount of 50 million euros.
712. Furthermore, the Bank also commenced the process of issuing a debenture on the UEMOA
financial market in the amount of FCFA 50 billion.
713. For special resources which principally concern the mobilization of internal resources at the
Community level, namely a portion of the Community Levy, no significant progress was made.
However, it is important to note that the new authorities at the ECOWAS Commission have shown
real commitment to help the Bank in its resource mobilization strategy, internally as well as
externally.
714. Overall, the issue of resource mobilization remains a major challenge for the Bank given the
enormous financing needs for projects and programmes at the regional and Member State levels .
 FINANCIAL SITUATION OF THE BANK AS AT END AUGUST 2016
715. An analysis of the Bank’s financial statements show a reduction of 3.0 % in its balance sheet, from
UA 547 million as at end December 2015 to UA 530 million as at end August 2016, driven primarily
by a decline of 5.6% in the Bank’s portfolio of projects.

716. Regarding the provisional result, the Bank recorded a surplus of UA 4.2 million as at end-August
2016, consolidating the surplus of UA 2.4 million recorded in 2015 .
- Balance Sheet
717. The provisional accounts of the Bank as at 31st August 2016 show a balance sheet of UA 530
million against UA 547 million as at 31st December 2015, corresponding to a decline of 3.0 %. This
reduction in the balance sheet is explained by a 9.3 % decrease in the Bank’s debt and the exiting
of some projects from its project portfolio, on account of their maturity, cancellation and
promoters not meeting conditions precedent for first disbursement during the period under
review.

CONCLUSION
719. As at 30th September 2016, the operational activities of the Bank have largely been impacted by
the pressure on its treasury as a result of the constraints linked to the lack of concessional
resources to meet up with the financing requests from Member States.
720. A fall of UA 16.4 million was observed in the balance sheet while a surplus of UA 4.2 million was
realized.
721. The Bank continues to intensify efforts in mobilizing adequate resources to finance its project
portfolio, and to ensure its viability as well as its profitability. In this regard, some arrears of the
first and second tranches of the called-up capital for a total amount of UA 10.2 million were paid
to the Bank.
722. Notwithstanding these, the major challenge facing the Bank remains the mobilization of adequate
resources, especially at the Community level. To this end, the payment of the arrears on the first
and second tranches of the called up capital by all Member States constitutes an important
leverage to mobilize resources from other partners. In the same vein, it has become necessary to
put in place in the ECOWAS zone, a mechanism for the mobilization of concessional resources with
a view to financing major infrastructure projects to accelerate regional integration. In this regard,
the strengthening of cooperation with the ECOWAS Commission portends well for EBID.

GENERAL CONCLUSION
723. This edition of the ECOWAS Annual Report gives a complete overview of key activities realised
during the period under review. It presents the level of implementation of activities as well as
challenges faced in building the economic, political and monetary union. Apart from financial
challenges which had some negative impact on the smooth running of the Community work
programme particularly in the first half of the year, the economic situation of Member States had
varying degrees of success. The current economic crisis in Nigeria is unprecedented in the history
of the country in the last two decades, leading to its economic recession in the second quarter of
2016.
724. For the ECOWAS region, using the October 2016 International Monetary Fund’s World Economic
Outlook (WEO), the report presents a negative economic growth rate of -0.2%. The situation of
the Nigerian economy, the largest economy in the Community affected the overall economic
growth of the ECOWAS region. Indeed, the negative and cumulative impact of the fall in the price
of oil on Nigeria, coupled with the fall in production as a result of vandalisation of oil installations
led to the fall in export revenue, devaluation of the Naira and contraction of the GDP projected at
1.7% compared to 2.7% in 2015.
725. A review of the status of implementation of the Community work programme indicates a
satisfactory level of performance, despite the current challenges. The record is itemized as
follows:
 Trade and free movement of goods and persons
726. A task force on free movement of goods in the ECOWAS region has been created in order to
improve the level of intra-regional trade and remove obstacles to the free movement of goods in
the region. Members of the Task Force were sworn in on 20 May 2016 in Ouagadougou, Burkina
Faso.
727. The Task Force is an ad-hoc consultative body under the authority of the President of the ECOWAS
Commission. At the request of the President, the Task Force will be invited to settle disputes
amicably among Member States arising from the implementation of the ECOWAS Trade
Liberalisation Scheme (ETLS). It shall also field advocacy and mediation missions to political
authorities in Member States to ensure effective and full implementation of Community texts on
ETLS. The Task Force comprises seven (7) eminent persons selected from Member States and with
a wide experience in obstacles to the improvement of regional trade. The Task Force is chaired by
H.E. Salou Djibo, former Head of State of Niger.
728. The Commission also continued to monitor the process of implementing the ECOWAS Biometric
Identity Card which is replacing the ECOWAS Travel Certificate. Three Member States, namely,
Senegal, Mali and Niger have already commenced its implementation.
729. Lastly, an operational mechanism for monitoring passenger and goods vehicles to combat
trafficking and ensure the security of persons has been launched in Cote d’Ivoire, Mali, Togo,
Benin, Burkina Faso and Niger.
 Economic and monetary integration
730. In 2016, the Commission directed efforts at making the Customs Union a reality, with particular
focus on the application of the ECOWAS Common External Tariff (CET), which entered into force
on 1st January 2015. To date, ten (10) Member States have implemented the CET. They are:
Benin, Burkina Faso, Cote d’Ivoire, Ghana, Guinea Bissau, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal and Togo.

731. Activities were also undertaken to ensure compliance with directives on the harmonisation of
indirect domestic taxation and statistics in Member States.
732. Concerning monetary integration, the Commission continued the implementation of the road map
for the creation of the single currency. In that regard, missions have been organized to evaluate
the macro-economic convergence of countries in relation to the convergence criteria adopted by
the region. The information gathered during the missions and an analysis of the country
convergence reports enabled the Commission to produce the ECOWAS 2015 Convergence Report,
and to update the Multilateral Surveillance database.
 Agriculture and food security
733. A review of the ten (10) years of implementation of the ECOWAS Common Agricultural Policy
(ECOWAP) reveals various achievements at the institutional level; emanating from the signature of
a pact by the major stakeholders of agricultural development in the region; the pact has made
ECOWAP the reference framework for the various interventions in the agricultural sector. The
achievements include the intensification production systems, particularly the production of grains
which witnessed strong growth in the region.
734. The activities carried out in 2016 focused among other things on the coordination, steering,
governance of the ECOWAP/CAADP as well as on Resilience, Prevention and Management of Food
Crisis in cooperation with CILSS, UEMOA, SWAC and other partner institutions. The meetings of
the Food Crisis Prevention Network (RPCA and PREGEC) resulted in the preparation of regular
early warning bulletins; these are information bulletins on trends in food prices.
735. The Commission also contributed to the fight against fruit-flies and development of improved
seeds. Other activities were focused on cross-border transhumance and pastoralism, food and
nutrition security, veterinary governance and the fight against cross-border animal diseases.
736. Concerning human development, gender and culture, the Commission continued the
implementation of a number of activities, among which are; i) strengthening Community tools for
child protection by formulating the West African Child Protection Strategy with the support of
UNICEF, «Save the Children», ISS, WAN and «Terre des Hommes», ii) strengthening regional
instruments for better gender management ; iii) implementation of humanitarian and social
activities and iv) support for youth, employment and sports activities.
737. The education sector also received attention with the award of ECOWAS scholarships, in
collaboration with the Association of African Universities, for masters and doctorate degree
programmes. There was also the harmonisation of primary education.
738. In the cultural sector, efforts were made towards making the ECOWAS Regional Intellectual
Property Observatory operational and completing the feasibility study on the establishment of a
West Africa Academy of Arts and Culture (WACA).
739.

Concerning infrastructural development, the Commission continued with making functional the
Noepe juxtaposed border post at the Ghana/Togo border, and finalising construction works of the
Seme/Krake juxtaposed border post at the Benin-Nigeria border.

740. The Commission also lent its support to the implementation of the Nigeria/Cameroun
multinational highway, the development programme of the Abidjan-Lagos corridor and the transGambia transport corridor. Other activities in this sector related to the development of the West
African air transport.
741. Activities were continued with the organisation of the Roundtable for financing the ECOWAS
Community Development Programme (CDP). In that regard, several meetings were organized with
the ADB and the World Bank, which are partners of the Commission in the implementation of this

programme. Meetings were also held with the Ivoirian authorities, the host country for the
Roundtable.
742. In the energy sector, the Commission monitored the implementation of the Study for the
development of rural and semi-urban electrification in West Africa as well as the Feasibility Study
for the extension of the West Africa Gas Pipeline. Three regional workshops on the Feasibility
Study were organised in Accra, Ouagadougou and Dakar respectively to validate the data
collection report, preliminary report and draft final report.
743. The Commission commenced activities on a programme for improving the quality of petroleum
products in the region. It also supervised the programmes for emergency power supply in
Gambia, Mali and Sierra Leone which are at the practical phase of implementing the programme
on the ground.
744. The major achievements in the field of governance, regional peace and security were on
strengthening the ECOWAS Early Warning System, supporting elections monitoring in Member
States (Benin, Niger, Cabo Verde and Ghana) and continuation of mediation efforts. In this
context, the combined efforts by various stakeholders to end the institutional crisis in Guinea
Bissau should be mentioned. Other activities have also been undertaken to strengthen the
ECOWAS Stand-by Force as well as the fight against the proliferation of small arms and light
weapons.
745. Finally, it is important to point out the remarkable achievements recorded in other Community
Institutions, particularly the ECOWAS Parliament which witnessed the inauguration of the Fourth
Legislature in February 2016, the ECOWAS Court of Justice, the West African Health Organisation,
the ECOWAS Bank for Investment and Development (EBID) and GIABA. Accounts for these
achievements have been given elsewhere in this report.
746. The measure of success achieved under the particularly difficult prevailing environment reflects
the commitment of devoted men and women to the ideals of regional integration. It is necessary
therefore that, in order to sustain and strengthen the current pace of work and consolidate
ECOWAS Institutions, the following recommendations should be made for the attention of
Member States:
-

Continued efforts at the structural transformation of the economies of the region and the
development of infrastructure in the light of developments in the international economic
environment;

-

Continued and intensified efforts to implement the regional integration programmes, such as
the ECOWAS CET, trade liberalisation scheme, free movement of persons and goods;
-

Continued efforts at consolidating good macro-economic management of the national
economies, a necessary condition for the establishment of a stable and viable
monetary union;

-

Compliance with the provisions of the protocol on Community levy;

-

Sustained efforts at the consolidation of regional peace and security;

- Accelerate institutional reforms of the Commission and other Community Institutions
to make them more functional and operational.
