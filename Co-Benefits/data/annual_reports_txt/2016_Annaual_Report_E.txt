The New Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD) Agency has a bold primary objective, namely to
Transform Africa. To achieve these sustainable development priorities, it continues to transform into a
development agency focusing on:
•	 incubating high impact projects that demonstrate proof-of-concept to translate the African Union’s (AU)
   continental strategic development frameworks into national development priorities,
•	 enhancing knowledge-sharing among countries, supported by evidence-based feedback on best practices
   for regional integration, and
•	 brokering partnerships and resource-mobilisation for the implementation of the First Ten Year
   Implementation Plan of Agenda 2063.

The programme focuses on the acceleration of modern agriculture to scale-up production, improve
productivity and encourage beneficiation. This is achieved by transforming commodities and introducing
services that contribute towards national prosperity, as well as food and nutrition security. The programme
outcomes include mitigating climate change, improving sustainable land and water management, improving
environmental governance, while promoting the blue economy and extractive industries.

ABOUT
The programme prioritises continental integration and infrastructure development to increase mobility,
thus increasing employment, as well as trade and socio-economic development. Its priority framework is
the Program for Infrastructure Development in Africa (PIDA), which addresses the infrastructure deficit
that blights the continent’s industrialisation and international competitiveness. Outcomes focus on trade
facilitation, as well as the roll-out of energy, transport, water and ICT infrastructure.

ABOUT
A key focus point of the programme is the harmonisation of country and regional-level industrialisation
policies to ensure synergies with continental-policy frameworks. Capacity enhancement in science,
technology, innovation, health and education are integral to support a revolution in science, technology and
innovation (STI) skills and capabilities. The main frameworks that are being implemented by the programme
include the Science, Technology and Innovation Strategy for Africa (STISA 2024), African Health Strategy,
Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Plan for Africa (PMPA), Continental Education Strategy (CESA) and Accelerated
Industrialisation Development for Africa (AIDA).

  7.4.	   The low staff costs can mainly be attributed to the delay in recruiting and on-boarding. At least
      12 core positions were advertised during August 2016 on NEPAD’s website and the vacancies closed
      in October 2016. It is, therefore, not expected that the total budget execution rate will be achieved at
      year-end for the category staff costs.

  7.5.	   In terms of operating costs, execution exceeded the budget, but more funds will be replenished
      within the approved budget.

  7.6.	        All of the earmarked capital items for purchase were procured during the fourth quarter of the year.

  7.7.	   Programmatic delivery stood at USD 6 million by the third quarter of the year. This is expected to
      significantly increase during the last quarter of the year to at least USD 10 million.
