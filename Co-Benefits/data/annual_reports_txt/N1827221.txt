Visits of the Security Council to Africa
8.
The Council undertook three missions to Africa in
the reporting period.
9.
From 1 to 7 March, the Council sent a mission to
the countries of the Lake Chad basin region, namely
Cameroon, Chad, the Niger and Nigeria. Later in March,
the mission’s Co-Chairs briefed the Council on the
situation in the region and emphasized the need for an
enhanced and holistic response to the challenges facing
the subregion. The Council also heard from the Deputy
Secretary-General, Amina J. Mohammed, who addressed
the 15-member organ for the first time in that capacity.
10. During the second mission, from 6 to 8 September,
the Council visited Ethiopia for the 11th annual joint
consultative meeting between the members of the
United Nations Security Council and the Peace and
Security Council of the African Union at the
Headquarters of the African Union, in Addis Ababa. At
the meeting there was discussion on the situations in
Somalia, South Sudan and the Lake Chad basin. This
mission was the first stand-alone visit by the members
of the Security Council to the African Union
Headquarters in Addis Ababa, and strengthened the
partnership and enhanced cooperation between the two
Councils.
11. The third mission was to the Sahel region and
comprised visits to Mali, Mauritania and Burkina Faso,
from 19 to 22 October, to assess the operationalization
of the Joint Force of the Group of Five for the Sahel.

society as well as actors involved in the implementation
of the Agreement on Peace and Reconciliation in Mali.
The Council saw evidence of great determination among
regional actors in the Sahel to overcome security
challenges through deployment of the regional force.
Burundi
12. The Council was briefed concerning the political,
socioeconomic and humanitarian situation in Burundi.
The Council noted that the Arusha Agreement must
remain the cornerstone of all efforts, and the first
priority was to promote an inclusive dialogue.
13. In August, the Council issued a presidential
statement (S/PRST/2017/13), in which it expressed
concern over the political and humanitarian situation,
noted that the security situation in Burundi had
remained generally calm, commended regional efforts to
help Burundians to find political solutions and reiterated
its support to the facilitation led by the East African
Community through the Special Envoy.
Central African region
14. The activities of Boko Haram continued to have
devastating
consequences
for
the
political,
socioeconomic, humanitarian and human rights
situations in the affected areas of Central Africa. While
progress continued in the fight against the Lord’s
Resistance Army, the group continued to demonstrate its
intention and capacity to conduct attacks against
civilians in the Central African region.
15. The Council received briefings on the Central
Africa region in June and December. The Special
Representative of the Secretary-General and Head of the
United Nations Regional Office for Central Africa
(UNOCA), briefed the Council on challenges in the
political, security, electoral and humanitarian situations
and in upholding human rights in the region and on the
implementation of the United Nations regional strategy
to combat LRA. The Council urged UNOCA to continue
to facilitate coordination among regional actors in
addressing the challenges the region faced.
Central African Republic
16. Despite the efforts made by the Government of the
Central African Republic and positive progress in the
political process coordinated by the African Union, the
security situation in the Central African Republic during
2017 continued to be critical, with an upsurge of
violence committed by the armed groups.
17. The Council issued statements to the press
expressing condemnations of attacks on the United
Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization
18-14247

Mission in the Central African Republic (MINUSCA) in
January, April, May, July and November. In February,
Council members released a press statement, deploring
attacks against civilians and incitement to ethnic and
religious hatred and violence. They also reaffirmed their
support for the African Initiative for Peace and
Reconciliation in the Central African Republic as the
main framework for a political solution.
18. In February, the Under-Secretary-General for
Peacekeeping Operations briefed the Council on the
latest report of the Secretary-General on the situation in
the Central African Republic. The Chair of the Central
African Republic configuration of the Peacebuilding
Commission and the Chair of the Committee established
pursuant to resolution 2127 (2013) concerning the
Central African Republic also made statements.
19. In March, the Under-Secretary-General for
Peacekeeping Operations and the President of the
Central African Republic, Faustin Archange Touadera,
briefed the Council on the situation in the country. The
briefers stressed that international support and
partnerships were vital to the stability of the Central
African Republic.
20. In April, the Council issued a presidential
statement (S/PRST/2017/5), in which it reaffirmed the
Council’s support for President Touadera, expressed
concern at the ongoing violence between armed groups,
acknowledged reconciliation efforts, and condemned
attacks against civilians.
21. In June, the Council received a briefing from the
Special Representative of the Secretary-General for the
Central African Republic, on the implementation of the
mandate of MINUSCA. The Special Representative
described the recent increase in violence in the Central
African Republic, and insisted that MINUSCA would
maintain a robust posture towards armed groups, and
that this would need to be accompanied by increased
peacebuilding efforts.
22. In July, the Council issued a presidential statement
(S/PRST/2017/9), in which it condemned the ongoing
clashes between armed groups and reiterated its support
for President Touadera and the Government and people
of the Central African Republic.
23. The Council had another briefing on the Central
African Republic in November, which was followed by
consultations in which the Under-Secretary-General for
Peacekeeping Operations participated.
24. The Council adopted resolution 2339 (2017) in
January, by which it renewed the sanctions regime
against the Central African Republic until 31 January
2018 and the mandate of the Panel of Experts until

troop increase of 900.
Côte d’Ivoire
25. In February, the Council was briefed by the
Special Representative of the Secretary-General and
Head of the United Nations Operation in Côte d’Ivoire
(UNOCI) on the latest developments in the country and
the Secretary-General’s report.

Secretary-General and Head of UNOCI delivered her
final briefing to the Council ahead of the mission’s
closure on 30 June. Members of the Council
commended the Government, and some stressed that
lessons learned in Côte d’Ivoire could be used for future
United Nations peacekeeping operations. Later in June,
the Council adopted a presidential statement
(S/PRST/2017/8) welcoming the closure of UNOCI.
Democratic Republic of the Congo
27. The Council held briefings and consultations
frequently on the situation in the Democratic Republic
of the Congo. In the briefings, the Council was informed
that, despite the efforts made by international partners
and the Transitional Government, political tensions in
the Democratic Republic of the Congo continued to rise,
amid continuing challenges to the full implementation
of the political agreement of 31 December 2016 and a
rising number of displaced people and an increase in
human rights abuses, which were prolonging political
uncertainty.
28. The security situation remained fragile in several
areas in the country, notably in the eastern Democratic
Republic of the Congo and the Kasaï region. The United
Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the
Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUSCO)
continued to readjust itself to best project force and
enhance the protection of civilians. The Council issued
a statement to the press in February, strongly
condemning violence in the Kasaï region, and in March,
in another press statement, the Council condemned the
killing of two members of the Group of Experts who
were monitoring the sanctions regime in the Kasai
Central region.
29. The Council issued three presidential statements
during 2017. In the first (S/PRST/2017/1), in January,
the Council welcomed the “comprehensive and
inclusive political agreement” signed in Kinshasa on
31 December 2016; in the second (S/PRST/2017/12), in
July, the Council stressed the urgent need for swift
10/234

implementation of that political agreement, and
condemned the violence in the Kasai region; and in the
third (S/PRST/2017/23), issued in November regarding
the investigation into the death of the two experts, the
Council reiterated the need for the Government to fully
investigate the killing of the two experts and bring the
perpetrators to justice.
30. In March, by resolution 2348 (2017), the Council
extended the mandate of MONUSCO until 31 March
2018, reducing its troop ceiling by 3,600 military
personnel to 16,215 troops, from 19,815 under its
previous mandate. The Council requested that the
Secretary-General conduct a strategic review of
MONUSCO and examine the continued relevance of its
mandated tasks, with a view to providing advice on a
further troop-level reduction and on an exit strategy.
31. In June, by resolution 2360 (2017), the Council
renewed until 1 July 2018 the measures relating to the
arms embargo, asset freeze and travel ban affecting the
Democratic Republic of the Congo, expanding those
sanctions to cover individuals and entities engaging i n
or providing support for acts that included planning,
directing, sponsoring or participating in attacks against
MONUSCO peacekeepers or United Nations personnel.
It also extended until 1 August 2018 the mandate of the
Group of Experts assisting the Committee established
pursuant to resolution 1533 (2004) concerning the
Democratic Republic of the Congo. In August, the Chair
of that Committee gave a briefing on the Committee ’s
work.
Great Lakes region
32. The Council convened an open meeting in April
with a briefing by the Special Envoy of the SecretaryGeneral for the Great Lakes Region, who described
efforts to implement the Peace, Security and
Cooperation Framework for the Democratic Republic of
the Congo and the Region.
33. In December, the Council adopted resolution 2389
(2017), in which it reiterated its call for States which
had signed the Framework to abide by the commitment
to non-interference in the internal affairs of
neighbouring countries and the prohibition against
abetting armed groups or war criminals. The Council
also encouraged enhanced cooperation among all
signatory States and urged enhanced regional
cooperation in countering armed groups.
Guinea-Bissau
34. In February, the Special Representative of the
Secretary-General for Guinea-Bissau briefed the
Council on the Secretary-General’s latest report and

Commission also briefed the Council and statements
were made by the representatives of Guinea-Bissau and
Liberia on behalf of the Economic Community of West
African States (ECOWAS).
35. In February, the Council adopted resolution 2343
(2017), by which it renewed the mandate of the United
Nations Integrated Peacebuilding Office in GuineaBissau (UNIOGBIS) until 28 February 2018. The
Council fully endorsed the recommendations outlined in
the report of the Secretary-General regarding the need
for UNIOGBIS to refocus its efforts towards political
capacities in support of the Special Representative’s
good offices and political facilitation role.
36. In May, Council members received a briefing in
consultations from the Under-Secretary-General for
Political Affairs on Guinea-Bissau, focusing on the
ongoing political crisis. In a statement to the press
issued after the meeting, Council members called on
relevant stakeholders to strictly respect and comply with
the Conakry Agreement and the ECOWAS road map and
expressed their readiness to take necessary measures to
respond to a further worsening of the situation in
Guinea-Bissau.
37. In August, the Council received a briefing on the
Secretary-General’s report on Guinea-Bissau from the
Special Representative of the Secretary-General and

leadership of Guinea-Bissau to implement the Conakry
Agreement of 14 October 2016.

on the presidential elections in Liberia and the
drawdown of UNMIL towards its final withdrawal.
Libya
43. In February, the Council discussed the latest
situation in Libya, focusing on the efforts to reach an
inclusive and sustainable political settlement in Libya.
The Special Representative of the Secretary-General for
Libya and Head of the United Nations Support Mission
in Libya (UNSMIL) briefed the Council and said that,
despite some important advances in Libya, not enough
progress had been made in implementing the Libyan
Political Agreement forged in 2015. Terrorism remained
a threat, living conditions were poor and armed groups
continued to abuse human rights with impunity. During
a meeting in April, the Special Representative cautioned
that Libya risked a return to widespread conflict and
urged parties to adhere to the Libyan Political
Agreement.
44. In May, the Council issued a statement to the press,
in which it condemned the military escalation in
southern Libya including the recent attack at Birak
al-Shati’ and the escalation in violence in Tripoli. The
Council called on all parties to exercise restraint,
reiterated that there can be no military solution and
urged all parties to express their support for national
reconciliation.
45. In June, the Council adopted resolution 2357
(2017), extending the authorizations under which States,
obtaining the consent of the vessel’s flag State prior to
any inspections, may inspect vessels on the high seas off
the coast of Libya believed to be in violation of the arms
embargo, as set out in resolution 2292 (2016), for a
further 12 months, until 12 June 2018. At the end of
June, by resolution 2362 (2017), the Council extended
until 15 November 2018 the sanctions measures relating
to illicit petroleum exports, adding “attacks against
United Nations personnel” as criteria for the ongoing
travel ban and asset freeze measures.

Report of the Security Council to the General Assembly for 2017

46. In July, the Council issued a statement to the press,
in which it welcomed the appointment of the new
Special Representative of the Secretary-General,
Ghassan Salamé, and looked forward to supporting his
efforts to facilitate a political solution in Libya. The
Council also welcomed the meeting of Faiez
Serraj,President of the Presidency Council of Libya, and
General Khalifa Haftar, Commander of the Libyan
National Army, hosted in Paris by the President of
France on 25 July, and the resulting joint declaration in
which they urged all Libyans to support a negotiated
political solution, national reconciliation and an
immediate ceasefire.
47. In September, the Council extended for one year
the mandate of UNSMIL, as an integrated special
political mission, by resolution 2376 (2017).
48. In October, by resolution 2380 (2017), the Council
extended for a third one-year period the authorization,
established under resolution 2240 (2015), for Member
States to inspect, as permitted under international law,
on the high seas off the coast of Libya, vessels that have
been, are being, or imminently will be used by organized
criminal enterprises for migrant smuggling or human
trafficking from Libya.
49. In October, the Council adopted a presidential
statement on the situation in Libya (S/PRST/2017/19),
in which it endorsed the United Nations Action Plan for
Libya presented by the Special Representative of the
Secretary-General, in support of a Libyan-led transition
that would lead to the establishment of stable, unified,
representative and effective governance in the
framework of the Libyan Political Agreement, which
remained the only viable framework to end the Libyan
political crisis.
50. In November, the Special Representative briefed
the Council on the United Nations Action Plan for Libya
and UNSMIL efforts to amend the Libyan Political
Agreement, organize a national conference, prepare for
elections and provide humanitarian assistance. Given
the division among Libyans, the Special Representative
emphasized the need to rebuild the national polity,
without which effective institutions could not form.
51. In December, reports of migrants being sold into
slavery in Libya were also of grave concern to the
Council. In a presidential statement (S/PRST/2017/24)
issued in December, it condemned such actions as
heinous abuses of human rights and possible crimes
against humanity. Later that month, the Council
reiterated in a presidential statement (S/PRST/2017/26)
that the Libyan Political Agreement was the only viable
framework to end the political crisis and that its

12/234

implementation was essential for holding elections and
finalizing the transition.
52. Throughout the reporting period, the Chair of the
Committee established pursuant to resolution 1970
(2011) concerning Libya regularly briefed the Council
on the activities and decisions of the Committee.
53. The Council heard briefings from the Chief
Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, in May
and November.
Mali
54. In January, the Council heard a briefing by the
Under-Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Operations,
who presented the latest report of the Secretary-General
on the situation in Mali, condemned the attack that
killed more than 50 people at a military base in Gao, and
called for speeding up implementation of the Agreement
on Peace and Reconciliation in Mali. The Minister for
Foreign Affairs, African Integration and International
Cooperation of Mali attended the meeting and addressed
the Council.
55. In April, the Council was briefed by the UnderSecretary-General for Peacekeeping Operations, who
presented the Secretary-General’s latest report and
provided an update on the situation in Mali, including
recent positive developments. He called for enhanced
efforts to combat transnational organized crime and to
implement the peace agreement, emphasized that
combating the accelerated activities of terrorists and the
transnational networks funding them continued to
require international support, and welcomed the
decision by the countries of the Group of 5 for the Sahel
(G-5 Sahel) to establish a regional force to combat such
activities. The Minister for Foreign Affairs of Mali
attended the meeting and addressed the Council.
56. In June, the Council held a briefing on Mali. The
Special Representative of the Secretary-General and
Head of the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated
Stabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA) reported
significant progress on implementation of the
Agreement on Peace and Reconciliation over the past
months, but agreed that terrorists and extremists were
gaining ground as existing tensions threatened to derail
achievements. The Minister for Foreign Affairs of Mali
emphasized that the Council’s authorization was
required to deploy a new joint counter-terrorism force
involving the G-5 Sahel States.
57. In October, the Special Representative of the
Secretary-General and Head of MINUSMA briefed the
Council. He said that all parties must redouble their
efforts to re-establish trust between them and, despite

18-14247

-----------------------Page 14 End-----------------------

Introduction

the prolonged delays in the implementation of the Peace
Agreement, engage in necessary reforms and provide a
peace dividend to the people. The Minister for Foreign
Affairs of Mali addressed the Council.
58. In 2017, the Council adopted two resolutions on
Mali, resolution 2364 (2017) in June, by which it
renewed the mandate of MINUSMA, and resolution
2374 (2017) in September, by which it established a
sanctions regime against individuals or entities that
threaten the peace, security or stability of Mali.
Somalia
59. In 2017, Somalia made significant progress in the
political process and security sector reform. At a
briefing in January the Council heard that the election
of a new Parliament in Somalia marked a milestone. In
May, the Deputy Special Representative of the
Secretary-General for Somalia added that peaceful
presidential elections in Somalia had created a unique
opportunity to forge a functional State.
60. With Somalia still facing the threat posed by
Al-Shabaab, drought and the humanitarian crisis, the
Council
issued
a
presidential
statement
(S/PRST/2017/3) in February, in which it called upon
the new President of Somalia to focus on the immediate
risk of famine and address the consequences of the
severe drought, and to accelerate political and security
reforms. In statements to the press issued in February
and June, the Council condemned terrorist attacks in
Mogadishu. In another press statement in August the
Council condemned a fatal attack by Al-Shabaab against
the Ugandan contingent of the African Union Mission in
Somalia (AMISOM), and in a press statement in
October it condemned a terrorist attack in Mogadishu in
which hundreds of civilians were killed. At a briefing in
September the Council was informed that hard-won
gains could be swept away without predictable funding
for AMISOM.
61. By resolution 2355 (2017), adopted in May, the
Council authorized States members of the African
Union to maintain the deployment of AMISOM until
31 August. On 30 August, by resolution 2372 (2017),
the Council extended its authorization of AMISOM until
31 May 2018, and approved a reduction of the level of
its uniformed personnel to a maximum of 21,626 by
31 December 2017, amid a transition of responsibilities
to Somali security forces. The Council emphasized that
the long-term objective for Somalia, with international
support, was for the Somali security forces to assume
full responsibility for security, recognizing that
AMISOM remained critical during the transition.

18-14247

62. In March, the Council adopted resolution 2346
(2017), by which it extended the mandate of the United
Nations Assistance Mission in Somalia (UNSOM) until
16 June. By resolution 2358 (2017), adopted in June, it
further extended the mandate of UNSOM until 31 March
2018.
63. In November, the Council adopted resolution 2385
(2017), by which it extended the modified arms embargo
on Somalia and the authorization for maritime
interdiction of illicit arms imports and charcoal exports
until 15 November 2018, and renewed the arms ban on
Eritrea for the same period. It also extended the mandate
of the Somalia and Eritrea Monitoring Group until
15 December 2018. The resolution was adopted by
11 votes in favour, with 4 abstentions.
64. Also in November, the Council adopted resolution
2383 (2017), by which it renewed for another year the
authorization for international naval forces to help to
fight piracy off the coast of Somalia.
Sudan and South Sudan
Darfur
65. The security situation in Darfur improved in 2017:
the armed groups have largely been defeated and there
was no new large-scale displacement. However, Darfur
still faced challenges in several areas, including the
political process and the humanitarian situation. During
the briefings held in January and April, the Council was
informed that, despite a decline in armed conflict,
civilians were still faced with violence and criminality,
while long-term solutions for 2.6 million displaced
persons remained elusive. It was suggested that the
mandate of the African Union-United Nations Hybrid
Operation in Darfur (UNAMID) should be amended. In
June, the Council was presented with the findings of a
strategic review recommending that the focus of
UNAMID should be adjusted.
66. In June the Council adopted resolution 2363
(2017), by which it renewed the mandate of UNAMID
until 30 June 2018, and endorsed the recommendations
in the strategic review, including a two-phase
restructuring of the mission that would lower troop and
police levels to 8,735 and 2,500, respectively. After that,
the Council held several meetings to follow up the

the
Intergovernmental Authority for Development (IGAD)

opposition embraced it. The Council welcomed and
strongly supported the establishment by IGAD of the

and several statements to the press. In the presidential
statement issued in March (S/PRST/2017/4), the

conflict and all other armed groups”, stressed that there
was no military solution to the conflict, and condemned
reported human rights violations and attacks on
humanitarian workers. In the presidential statement
issued in December (S/PRST/2017/25) the Council
strongly supported the convening of an inclusive forum
as proposed by IGAD to get the Agreement back on
track and aim for substantive progress on the initiative
when it convened at the end of December. In press

Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process, highlevel officials from the Department of Political Affairs
of the Secretariat and other invited guests briefed the
Council with a general concern for the aggregate
situation on the ground.
122. Following the adoption of resolution 2334 (2016),
the international community did not see the shift in
behaviour among the parties that was called for in the
resolution. Instead, the international community
continued to witness the expansion of settlement
activities, the demolition of Palestinian private
properties and increasing violence between Israel and
Palestine. These assessments were orally reported by the
Special Coordinator to the Council in March, June,
September and December.
123. In mid-July, an emergency consultation was
convened by the Secretariat, in response to the
immediate and dire humanitarian situation in the Gaza
Strip. The Special Coordinator briefed the Council on
the alarming humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip.
Members of the Council called for urgent action by all
relevant parties in order to alleviate the suffering of the
people in Gaza and welcomed the continued external
support provided to Gaza. In November, speaking in
reference to an intra-Palestinian reconciliation
agreement reached in October, the Special Coordinator
said that a genuine change in Gaza, including full
Palestinian Authority control over security, would help
to restore confidence in the feasibility of a
comprehensive peace agreement.
124. The Jerusalem situation drew the attention of the
Council throughout the year. In July, the Council
discussed the situation in Jerusalem in consultations.
The Special Coordinator briefed the Council on the
latest developments with regard to the Haram al-Sharif.

during which the Special Coordinator warned the
Council that developments at holy sites in Jerusalem
over the previous days had demonstrated the grave risk
18-14247

-----------------------Page 20 End-----------------------

Introduction

of a dangerous escalation, including the transformation
of the conflict into a religious one, emphasizing the risk
of dragging Israel and Palestine and the rest of the
region into a vortex of violence. He called for a focus
on the need to restore a political perspective, to bring
Israelis and Palestinians back into an environment
conducive to negotiations on a final status arrangement
and to avoid turning the national Israeli-Palestinian
conflict into a religious one. Council members and
speakers expressed their views.
126. A briefing was held in December, following the
announcement by the United States of America of its
decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel
and to move its embassy to that city from Tel Aviv. The
Special Coordinator reported that the position of the
United Nations on the status of Jerusalem had not
changed: it remained a final status issue for which a
comprehensive, just and lasting solution must be
achieved through negotiations between the parties, and
on the basis of relevant United Nations resolutions and
other agreements. Expressing concern about the potential
risk of a violent escalation, he called on all parties to
refrain from engaging in provocative actions and rhetoric.
Council members exchanged views on the issue.
127. Later in December in a briefing and consultations,
the Special Coordinator noted with regret that there had
not been significant positive moves towards advancing
peace, and the parties remained more divided than ever.
Following the consultations, the Council took action on
a draft resolution tabled by Egypt on the status of
Jerusalem. The Council failed to adopt the draft
resolution owing to the negative vote of one permanent
member of the Council, leading to a recorded result of
14 in favour and 1 against.
The situation in the Middle East
(Syrian Arab Republic)

for the Council in 2017. Meetings were held on the

High Representative for Disarmament Affairs and the
Head of the Organisation for the Prohibition of
Chemical Weapons-United Nations Joint Investigative
Mechanism briefed Council members on chemical
weapons in the Syrian Arab Republic. The Council
failed to adopt a draft resolution seeking to impose
sanctions on individuals and entities associated with the
Government of the Syrian Arab Republic. In April, the
Council held a briefing on the reports of alleged use of
chemical weapons in the Syrian Arab Republic,

18-14247

following the chemical weapons attack in the Khan
Shaykhun area of Idlib. The Council failed to adopt a
draft resolution relating to the Khan Shaykhun attack.
From August, the renewal of the mandate of the Joint
Investigative Mechanism received particular attention
by the Council. In October and November, the Council
failed to adopt four draft resolutions by which it would
have renewed the mandate of the Mechanism before its
expiration on 17 November.
130. Throughout the year, a series of meetings was held
in Geneva and Astana as part of the intra-Syrian talks
and Astana dialogues. Nearly every month, the Special
Envoy of the Secretary-General briefed the Council on
the progress of the intra-Syrian talks. In January, the
Council issued a statement to the press on the
international meeting on the Syrian Arab Republic in
Astana. The Council issued another statement to the
press in March, mainly welcoming the announcement by
the Special Envoy of a clear agenda for future
negotiations, in accordance with resolution 2254 (2015).
At the fourth round of Astana talks in Kazakhstan, the
Russian Federation, the Islamic Republic of Iran, and
Turkey signed an agreement to create four
“de-escalation zones” in the Syrian Arab Republic,
which came into effect on 6 May.
131. The Council continued to receive monthly
briefings on the implementation of resolutions 2139
(2014), 2165 (2014) and 2191 (2014) from the UnderSecretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and other
officials from the Office for the Coordination of
Humanitarian Affairs, who introduced the reports of the
Secretary-General and detailed the humanitarian
situation in the Syrian Arab Republic and the cross-line
and cross-border humanitarian assistance. In December,
the Council adopted resolution 2393 (2017), which
renewed for a further period of one year the
authorization established by the Council in resolution
2165 (2014) regarding cross-border and cross-line
humanitarian access to the Syrian Arab Republic.
132. In April, the Council released a statement to the
press condemning the terrorist attack in Rashidin,

of the Kurdistan Regional Government to unilaterally
hold a referendum.
134. In February and July, the Council issued

Lebanon
137. The Council met regularly on Lebanon, including
in consultations on resolutions 1559 (2004) and 1701
(2006) and on the operations of the United Nations
Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL). In August, by
resolution 2373 (2017), the Council extended the
mandate of UNIFIL until 31 August 2018. The Council
further authorized UNIFIL to take the steps necessary to
ensure that its area of operations was not used for hostile
activities of any kind, and requested the SecretaryGeneral to explore ways to enhance the Force’s efforts
by increasing its visible presence.
138. The Council issued a statement to the press in
December in which it welcomed the return of the Prime
Minister, Saad Hariri, to Lebanon and his decision to
continue his term. The Council also welcomed previous
efforts, which contributed to the resumption of the
Council of Ministers of Lebanon on 5 December. The
Council also reaffirmed its support for the ongoing
efforts of the Lebanese authorities to restore normal
functioning of institutions and prepare for the holding
of legislative elections by May 2018, and encouraged
the international community to continue and increase its
support for the political, social and economic stability
of Lebanon.

maximum restraint. The Council welcomed the progress
made in returning UNDOF to its former headquarters at
Camp Faouar, on the Bravo side of the area of
separation.
Yemen
140. Throughout 2017, the continuing and escalated
armed conflict in Yemen brought a deteriorating security
situation and increased fragmentation and division
among parties. As a result, the humanitarian crisis
continuously worsened, with an outbreak of cholera and
increasing threats of famine, and the expansion of
Al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula and ISIL in Yemen
was also witnessed. Despite the commitment and
tireless efforts of the Special Envoy of the SecretaryGeneral for Yemen to bring the parties to negotiations
with a view to ending the conflict in Yemen, there was
unfortunately no significant progress on resuming
political talks.
141. In February, by adopting resolution 2342 (2017),
the Council renewed for one year, until 26 February
2018, the targeted sanctions measures imposed by
resolution 2140 (2014).
142. In
June,
in
a
presidential
statement
(S/PRST/2017/7), the Council expressed grave concern
about the devastating humanitarian impact of the
conflict on civilians and called on all parties to engage
constructively with the Special Envoy’s proposals for
increasing commercial and humanitarian shipments
through Red Sea ports, in order to allow safe, rapid and
unhindered access for humanitarian supplies and
personnel to all affected governorates. The Council also
called on the parties to immediately agree on the
modalities for a durable cessation of hostilities and to
engage in peace talks in a flexible and constructive
manner, without preconditions and in good faith.
143. In December, the Council issued a statement to the
press, in which it condemned the ballistic missile attack
by Houthi forces against Saudi Arabia, stressing that all
Member States must fully implement all aspects of the
arms embargo, as required.

Issuing
a
presidential
statement
(S/PRST/2017/21), the Council stated that the
protection of children in armed conflict should be an
important aspect of any comprehensive strategy to
resolve conflict and sustain peace, and remained deeply
concerned over the lack of progress on the ground where
parties to conflict continued to violate with impunity the
relevant provisions of applicable international law
relating to the rights and protection of children. It also
called upon all parties to armed conflict to allow and
facilitate safe, timely and unhindered humanitarian
access to children.
