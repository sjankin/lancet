             The Bank Group approved a total of USD 253.0 million in loans to the
             Governments of Kenya (USD 147.3 million) and Uganda (USD 105.7
             million) for upgrading a 118 km road connecting the two countries,
             building a 32 km bypass around the Kenyan town of Eldoret, and setting
             up a one-stop border-post in Suam.

             The new road will half travel time between Kapchorwa (Uganda) and
             Kitale (Kenya) and, together with the one-stop border-post, will help
             boost regional trade. The Eldoret bypass will reduce traffic congestion
             in the town, increasing the average speed from 26 km per hour along
             the existing road to 42 km per hour via the bypass.
