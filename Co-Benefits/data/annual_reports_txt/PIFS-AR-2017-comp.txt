     Introduction
     For almost five decades, the countries of the Pacific have addressed common interests through a variety of regional,
     and increasingly sub-regional, approaches. The motivation for this is simple: we know that we can achieve more
     together, than alone.
     A political community of 18 independent states and self- governing territories, the Pacific Islands Forum seeks to
     address the challenges and opportunities that face the Pacific through political dialogue and decision-making. The
     Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat supports the Leaders of the Pacific Islands Forum to utilize regional action to realize
     their vision for the Pacific region.
     The Forum is also united by shared values which guide all its policy making and implementation. These have evolved
     over the history of the Forum, with their most recent expression articulated in the Framework for Pacific Regionalism.

     The Framework for Pacific Regionalism
     The Forum further committed to deepening regionalism with the endorsement of The Framework for Pacific Regionalism
     in July 2014. The Framework commits Leaders to:
      “working together to address our common challenges, harness shared strengths and ensure that our individual and
                            collective advancements bring practical benefits to all Pacific peoples.”
     The Framework for Pacific Regionalism recognizes the need for a new inclusive and game-changing approach to Pacific
     regionalism that enables Leaders to lead and navigate the Pacific through the global and regional geopolitical forces
     that impact on our region’s ability to realize the unmet development needs of Pacific Island peoples.
     Through the Framework, Leaders recognize that Pacific Regionalism now and into the future must be adaptable,
     innovative, inclusive and most importantly, it must positively impact the lives of our people.
     In support of the realization of the Leaders’ vision, the Framework for Pacific Regionalism identifies four principal and
         enduring objectives :
     •	 Sustainable development that combines economic social, and cultural development in ways that improve
        livelihoods and well-being and use the environment sustainably;
     •	 Economic growth that is inclusive and equitable;
     •	 Security that ensures stable and safe human, environmental and political conditions for all; and
     •	 Strengthened governance, legal, financial, and administrative systems .

The Context for Pacific Regionalism
The global and regional geopolitical and development
context is shifting and the region is faced with a range of
external and internal factors that are acting to reshape
it. Such factors impact on the Forum’s ability to advance
the Leaders vision for the region and achieve the
objectives of the Framework for Pacific Regionalism. The
region faces some enduring challenges:


 •	 Ongoing vulnerabilities to environmental and
    economic shocks;
 •	 Continued dependencies on aid and external
    financing;
 •	 Low levels of economic growth;
 •	 Stubborn levels of poverty and rising inequalities;
 •	 Structural constraints, generally recognized in

     2017 PERFORMANCE ACHIEVEMENTS
     48th Pacific Islands Forum and ‘The Blue Pacific’
     The 48th Pacific Islands Forum took place from 5 – 8
     September, in Apia, Samoa under the theme of The Blue
     Pacific: Our Sea of Islands; Our Security through Sustainable
     Development, Management and Conservation.
     As outlined in the 48th Pacific Islands Forum Communique,
     Leaders endorsed The Blue Pacific identity as the core
     driver of collective action for advancing the Leaders vision,
     under the Framework for Pacific Regionalism. Through this
     endorsement, Leaders also recognised The Blue Pacific as
     a new narrative that calls for inspired leadership and a
     long-term Forum foreign policy commitment to act as one
     “Blue Continent”. The Blue Pacific provides new emphasis
     for Pacific Regionalism, strengthening the narrative and
     the concept of regionalism within existing regionalism
     policy frameworks.
     The 48th Pacific Islands Forum comprised of key meetings
     and dialogue sessions with Forum Leaders, culminating in
     the Forum Leaders Retreat, which was held on Friday 8
     September, at Taumeasina Resort, Apia. These meetings
     included the Smaller Island States (SIS) Leaders Meeting,

                         PACIFIC ISLANDS FORUM SECRETARIAT




    Secretary General’s Statement

    I am pleased to present the Secretariat’s financial statements and independent auditors’ report
    for the year ended 31 December 2017.

    During the year, we expended FJD42m, while our total cash and investment holdings at year
    end amounted to FJD35m.

    I remain conscious of the responsibility entrusted to the Secretariat by Members of the Pacific
    Islands Forum, and by our development partners, to manage such a substantial level of funding.
    I therefore reaffirm our commitment to ensure that these financial statements provide an
    accountable and transparent summary of the Secretariat’s financial activities for the 2017
    financial year.

    In my opinion:

    (a)    the accompanying General fund statement of profit or loss is drawn up so as to give a
           true and fair view of the results of the Secretariat for the year ended 31 December 2017;

    (b)    the accompanying statement of financial position is drawn up so as to give a true and
           fair view of the state of the Secretariat’s affairs as at 31 December 2017;

    (c)    the accompanying statement of changes in funds is drawn up so as to give a true and
           fair view of the movement in funds of the Secretariat for the year ended 31 December
           2017; and

    (d)    the accompanying statement of cash flows is drawn up so as to give a true and fair view
           of the cash flows of the Secretariat for the year ended 31 December 2017.



    Dated at Suva this              27th    day of       April      2018

     Independent Auditor’s Report

     To the Members of Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat

     Report on the audit of the financial statements

     Opinion

     We have audited the accompanying financial statements of Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat (the
     ‘Secretariat’), which comprise the statement of financial position as at 31 December 2017, and the
     general fund statement of comprehensive income, statement of changes in funds and statement of
     cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of
     significant accounting policies.

     In our opinion, the accompanying financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial
     position of the Secretariat as at 31 December 2017, and of its financial performance and cash flows
     for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards.

     Basis for Opinion

     We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs). Our
     responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the
     Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report.

     We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis
     for our opinion.

     Independence

     We are independent of the Secretariat in accordance with the ethical requirements of the International
     Ethics Standards Board for Accountant’s Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (IESBA Code)
     that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in Fiji, and we have fulfilled our other ethical
     responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the IESBA Code.

     Other information

     Members and management are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises
     the information included in the Secretariat’s Annual Report for the year ended 31 December 2017 (but
     does not include the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon).

     Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express
     any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

     In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other
     information identified above and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially
     inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears
     to be materially misstated.

                                                                                                                3




   If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material statement of this other
   information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard, except that
   not all other information was available to us at that date of our signing.

   Responsibilities of Members and Management for the Financial Statements

   Members and management are responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial
   statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards and for such internal
   control as the members and management determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial
   statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

   In preparing the financial statements, the members and management are responsible for assessing the
   Secretariat’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going
   concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the members and management either
   intend to liquidate the Secretariat or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

   The members and management are responsible for overseeing the Secretariat’s financial reporting
   process.

   Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements

   Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole
   are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report
   that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee
   that an audit conducted in accordance with the ISAs will always detect a material misstatement when
   it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or
   in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken
   on the basis of the financial statements.

   As part of an audit in accordance with the ISAs, we exercise professional judgement and maintain
   professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:

    • Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to
      fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit
      evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not
      detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error,
      as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override
      of internal control.

    • Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures
      that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the
      effectiveness of the Secretariat’s internal control.

    • Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting
      estimates and related disclosures made by the members and management.

-----------------------Page 21 End-----------------------

                                                                                                                  4




      • Conclude on the appropriateness of the members and managements use of the going concern basis
        of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists
        related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Secretariat’s ability to
        continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to
        draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if
        such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit
        evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may
        cause the Secretariat to cease to continue as a going concern.

      • Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the
        disclosures, and whether the financial statements represents the underlying transactions and events
        in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

     We communicate with members and management regarding, among other matters, the planned scope
     and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal
     control that we identify during our audit.

     Restriction on Use

     This report is made solely to the Secretariat’s Members, as a body. Our audit work has been
     undertaken so that we might state to the Members those matters we are required to state to them in
     an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept
     or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Secretariat and the Members as a body, for our audit
     work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

                                       FORUM COMMUNIQUÉ

             The Forty-Eighth Pacific Islands Forum was held in Apia, Samoa from 5 – 8 September

     Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, French Polynesia, Republic of Kiribati, Republic of the
     Marshall Islands, Republic of Nauru, New Caledonia, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon

     New Zealand by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and Niue by the Minister for Social Services.
     The Forum Leaders’ Retreat was held at Taumeasina Island Resort in Apia on 8 September 2017.

     2.      Tokelau attended the formal session as an Associate Member. American Samoa, Wallis and
     Futuna, the African, Caribbean and Pacific Group of States Secretariat; the Asian Development
     Bank, the Commonwealth Secretariat, the United Nations (UN), the Western and Central Pacific
     Fisheries Commission (WCPFC), the International Organisation for Migration and the World Bank
     attended as Observers. The Council of Regional Organisations of the Pacific (CROP): the Pacific
     Islands Forum Fisheries Agency (PIFFA); the Pacific Power Association (PPA); the Secretariat
     of the Pacific Community (SPC); the South Pacific Tourism Organisation (SPTO); the Secretariat
     of the Pacific Regional Environment Programme (SPREP); and the University of the South Pacific
     (USP) were represented by their respective Heads of Organisation and senior officials.

     3.     Forum Leaders expressed their warm appreciation to the Prime Minister of Samoa, the
     Government and the people of Samoa for the kind and generous hospitality extended to all
     delegations. Leaders commended the outstanding preparations and facilitation of the 2017
     Leaders’ and related meetings which enabled Leaders and all participants to hold inclusive and
     constructive discussions, and contributed to the overall success of the 48th Pacific Islands Forum.


     THE BLUE PACIFIC – OUR SEA OF ISLANDS – OUR SECURITY THROUGH
     SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT, MANAGEMENT AND CONSERVATION

     4.      Leaders reaffirmed the Framework for Pacific Regionalism (FPR) as their platform for a
     renewed commitment to collective action to drive the region’s policy agenda towards the
     realisation of the Leaders vision for a region of peace, harmony, security, social inclusion, and
     prosperity so that all Pacific people can lead free, healthy and productive lives.


                                                                                                      2

-----------------------Page 28 End-----------------------

5.      Leaders further reaffirmed the value of ownership of the regional agenda through an
inclusive and transparent policy development process. Leaders recognised the value of dialogue
processes with the Associate Member, Observers, Forum Dialogue Partners, CROP Heads, civil
society and private sector to inform the Leaders meeting.

6.      Leaders endorsed The Blue Pacific identity as the core driver of collective action for
advancing the Leaders vision under the Framework for Pacific Regionalism. Through this
endorsement, Leaders recognised The Blue Pacific as a new narrative that calls for inspired
leadership and a long-term Forum foreign policy commitment to act as one “Blue Continent”. In
considering the shifts in the global and regional contexts, Leaders recognised the opportunity of
The Blue Pacific identity to reinforce the potential of our shared stewardship of the Pacific Ocean
and reaffirm the connections of Pacific peoples with their natural resources, environment, culture
and livelihoods.

7.      Leaders further recognised The Blue Pacific as being about all Pacific peoples comprising
our ocean of islands, who recognise their needs and potential, who plan and own their development
agenda, and who can act collectively for the good of all, rather than a few. The Blue Pacific is the
catalyst for deeper Pacific regionalism.

8.      Leaders reiterated their support for existing regional ocean policy and declarations, and
strengthening of the Office of the Pacific Ocean Commissioner for coordination and advocacy of
cross-sectoral ocean issues. Leaders called for the commencement of the negotiations in the UN
for a new Implementing Agreement on the Conservation and Sustainable Use of Biodiversity on
Areas Beyond National Jurisdiction.

9.      Leaders committed to fast track the development of policies to ban the use of single-use
plastic bags, plastic and styrofoam packaging and called on Pacific Rim partners to join and
commit to action on addressing marine pollution and marine debris, to maintain the environmental
integrity of the Pacific Ocean for people, planet and prosperity.

10.    Leaders called for a united regional effort that establishes and secures international
recognition of the permanent protection and integrity of the maritime zones and sovereignty from
the impacts of climate change and sea-level rise. Leaders noted the leadership of Cook Islands,
French Polynesia, New Caledonia, Palau and Vanuatu toward integrated ocean management of
their maritime and exclusive economic zones.


ANALYSIS OF REGIONAL GOVERNANCE AND FINANCING

11.     In considering the need for coherent implementation of the Forum Leaders’ decisions as
well as the need to address the current fragmentation of actors in their support of the regional
policy agenda, Leaders confirmed they are the apex of the regional architecture and the driver of
regional priority setting and resource allocation. Leaders’ committed to ensuring a whole-of-
government engagement with the regionalism agenda to strengthen the regional architecture and
maximise effective use of resources, regional actions and initiatives; embed the Forum agenda
across the CROP and its member agencies, including at ministerial and institutional governance
levels; and commence a Member-driven process to converge regional meeting platforms and
agenda setting processes.

                                                                                                  3

-----------------------Page 29 End-----------------------

     12.      In relation to implementing the Forum agenda, while recognising national needs and
     priorities, Leaders encouraged donors and partners to the region to align their resources, including
     through a regular regional donor roundtable linked to the Forum Economic Ministers Meeting.

     13.    Leaders instructed CROP and its member agencies to ensure that meetings and their
     agendas are rationalised to take forward the Forum agenda in a synchronised way, and directed
     the CROP Chair to work closely with the Heads of CROP agencies and their respective Governing
     Boards to develop an implementation plan of the recommendations above and to report to Leaders
     on progress.


     SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT PRIORITIES

     14.     In endorsing the Pacific Roadmap for Sustainable Development (PRSD), Leaders
     reinforced the centrality of the FPR in contextualising global commitments under the 2030
     Agenda and the SAMOA Pathway. Leaders acknowledged with appreciation the work of the SDG
     Taskforce and all key stakeholders in preparing the PRSD. Leaders committed to focusing their
     national as well as regional collective efforts to ensure that “no one is left behind” and requisite
     resources are secured. Leaders recognised that the five elements of the Roadmap provided the
     requisite guidance for the achievement of the 2030 Agenda by the region. Specifically, the
     elements are: (i) leadership and coordination; (ii) advocacy and communications; (iii) regional
     monitoring and indicators; (iv) integrated reporting; and (v) supporting the means of
     implementation.

     15.    Leaders agreed to strengthen Pacific solidarity by ensuring collective efforts through
     improved ownership and returns from The Blue Pacific by way of specific initiatives including the
     following regional priorities:

         (a) Fisheries
     16.     Leaders acknowledged the progress made by the Fisheries Task Force in implementing its
     agreed work programme, and noted the need for national level policy coherence to support
     regional policy positions as highlighted in the Tuna Political Mapping Report and noted the need
     to consult further with the relevant fisheries experts on the proposed recommendations in the
     report. Leaders recognised from their dialogues with stakeholders that the increasing demands for
     fisheries resources across the region requires coherent and coordinated approaches to address
     multidimensional issues including illegal, unreported, unregulated (IUU) fishing, and monitoring,
     control and surveillance.

     17.     Leaders noted with concern reports that the negotiation of a new management measure for
     tropical tuna in the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC) is being used by
     some WCPFC members, including some Forum Dialogue Partners to undermine zone based
     measures, that Forum Members have developed in exercise of their sovereign rights under
     international law. Leaders called on such partners to withdraw proposals for flag State based
     measures and to actively support Forum members’ efforts to gain benefits from sustainable
     management of fisheries in their EEZs.




                                                                                                       4

    (b) Climate Change and Resilience
18.     Leaders reaffirmed their call for the Framework for the Resilient Development of the
Pacific (FRDP) to be fully elaborated to reflect the outcomes of the Paris Agreement and called
on the Forum Secretariat to undertake a process for this elaboration.

19.     Leaders supported, on a trial basis for an initial period of two years, the proposed Pacific
Resilience Partnership (PRP) governance arrangements agreed by the PRP Working Group to
ensure effective implementation of the FRDP while encouraging flexibility to allow the
participation of Members in the Task Force; and committed the Forum Secretariat to support the
successful implementation of the FRDP.

20.    With regard to the issue of fragility and vulnerability, Leaders reiterated their call to the
World Bank for an expanded definition of “fragility” to take into account the vulnerabilities faced
by Forum Island Countries.

21.    Leaders welcomed the early entry into force of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change in
November 2016, at the twenty-second Conference of the Parties (COP 22), in Marrakech, and
reaffirmed the Pacific Islands Forum’s commitment to continue to work with others who remain
steadfast on their obligations under the Paris Agreement. Leaders welcomed the adoption of the
Kigali amendment to the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer
(“Montreal Protocol”) and urged countries to accede to the amendment.

22.     Leaders recognised the unique opportunity that the twenty-third Conference of the Parties
(COP 23) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change provides to the
Pacific, building up on the outcome of the UN Ocean Conference, and expressed their support
towards Fiji’s COP 23 Presidency.

23.      Leaders acknowledged Fiji’s five key priorities for the COP 23 presidency, namely: (i)
facilitative dialogue; (ii) implementation guidelines and the Paris Agreement Rule Book; (iii)
Gender, local communities and indigenous peoples platform; (iv) Adaptation and loss and damage;
and (v) Oceans pathway through 2020 that strengthens the ocean-climate change nexus.

24.     Recognising the significant vulnerability of Forum Island Countries to the adverse impacts
of climate change, Leaders called for urgent, ambitious action from the global community to
address climate change, including the provision of finance to implement the Nationally
Determined Contributions, finalising the Paris Agreement Guidelines by 2018, and launching an
inclusive process to elaborate the Facilitative Dialogue.

25.    Leaders tasked the Forum Secretariat to coordinate, in consultation with Members, the

     SECURITY

         (a) Radioactive contaminants in the Republic of the Marshall Islands
     28.     Leaders recalled that the Republic of the Marshall Islands was placed by the international
     community under the trusteeship of the United Nations administered by the United States of
     America, both of which therefore have ongoing obligations to encourage a final and just resolution
     for the Marshallese people. Leaders welcomed the recommendations in the Special Rapporteur’s
     report submitted to the UN Human Rights Council in September 2012, and that the statement of
     the UN Secretary-General on 14 August 2017 that “finding a solution to this issue is critical for
     the future of the Republic of the Marshall Islands” and his assurance that the relevant United
     Nations entities stand ready to respond to requests for assistance.

     29.     Leaders supported bilateral, regional and multilateral action to assist the Republic of the
     Marshall Islands in its efforts to engage the United States towards a justified fair and just resolution
     to the U.S. Nuclear Testing Programme. Leaders agreed to submit letters to the US Government
     urging the US to take further action to meaningfully address the ongoing impacts resulting from
     the US Nuclear Testing Programme, and to the United Nations Secretary General regarding any
     requests for assistance submitted to relevant United Nations agencies by the Republic of the
     Marshall Islands, and any other measures which may assist to address the ongoing impacts of
     nuclear testing in the Pacific.

     30.     Leaders recalled their decision from 2016 and reaffirmed that the Forum Secretariat
     coordinate assistance by CROP Agencies to the Republic of the Marshall Islands in addressing
     ongoing impacts of nuclear testing, including, inter alia, human rights, environmental
     contamination, and health impacts. Leaders further tasked the Forum Secretariat to report to the
     49th Pacific Islands Forum on actions taken in this regard.

         (b) Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands (RAMSI)
     31.     In reflecting on the state of Pacific regionalism since the Forty-Seventh Pacific Islands
     Forum in 2016, Leaders acknowledged the conclusion of RAMSI and recognised it as a true
     testament to the benefits of regionalism and a shining example of regional cooperation and
     diplomacy, embodying more than a decade of partnership and cooperation amongst Forum
     members.

     32.    Leaders congratulated the Government and the people of Solomon Islands for the success
     of RAMSI and acknowledged with appreciation the support of all Forum countries to RAMSI
     through the deployment of personnel, and to Australia and New Zealand for the significant
     investment of resources to RAMSI.

     33.     In considering the recommendation by Forum Foreign Ministers to expand and strengthen
     collective action for regional security due to emerging security threats to the region, Leaders
     agreed to build on the Biketawa Declaration and other Forum security related declarations as a
     foundation for strategic future regional responses, recognising the importance of an expanded
                                                                                                           6

concept of security inclusive of human security, humanitarian assistance, prioritising
environmental security, and regional cooperation in building resilience to disasters and climate
change. Leaders tasked the Forum Secretariat to initiate consultations on developing a
comprehensive ‘Biketawa Plus’ declaration for Leaders consideration at their next meeting.

34.    In their dialogues with various stakeholders, Leaders acknowledged the need to strengthen
cooperation and information sharing in maritime domain awareness. Leaders also recognised the
importance of addressing cyber-security issues.

      (c) Tensions in the North Pacific
35.     Leaders condemned repeated efforts by the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea
(DPRK) to test nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles, and the threat posed to Guam, which
constitutes a threat to the wider Pacific Islands region. Leaders also agreed on the importance of
ensuring the full implementation of relevant UN Security Council Resolutions.

36.     Leaders committed to deregistering any DPRK trading or fishing vessels currently flagged
on Pacific states’ shipping registers. New Zealand and Australia will assist other member states
with intelligence gathering to identify illegally flagged DPRK vessels and offered to off-set the
financial burden incurred.

     (d) West Papua (Papua)
37.     Leaders recognised the constructive engagement by Forum countries with Indonesia with
respect to elections and human rights in West Papua and Papua and to continue dialogue in an
open and constructive manner.


FORUM MEMBERSHIP AND MEETINGS

of Samoa this year, Leaders reaffirmed their commitment to reinvigorate their dialogue with all
stakeholders in order to ensure more meaningful and robust engagement.

    (a) Ministerial Meeting Charters
39.     Consistent with this, Leaders also considered meeting charters aimed at ensuring greater
alignment and coherence to a prioritised regional agenda, in support of the delivery of the vision
and objectives of the FPR.

40.    Leaders endorsed the meeting charters for the Forum Economic Ministers Meeting and
the Forum Foreign Affairs Ministers Meeting respectively.

41.    Leaders endorsed fisheries and climate change to be standing agenda items for Forum
Leaders given that they are both key regional priorities that require a whole-of-government
approach, foremost Leaders’ close oversight.

     (b) Forum Membership
42.      Leaders noted that French Polynesia has deposited its instruments of ratification to
formalise its membership status. New Caledonia is close to concluding its instruments of
ratification. Leaders agreed that the authoritative text be in English only.

                                                                                                7

     43.    Leaders further noted that future applications should be subject to agreed criteria and due
     process.


     PACIFIC ISLANDS FORUM SECRETARIAT SUSTAINABLE FUNDING STRATEGY

     44.     Leaders emphasised the need to demonstrate members’ equitable ownership of the
     Secretariat and ensure adequate and predictable funding of the Secretariat in order to safeguard its
     role as an independent body providing high quality policy advice to advance Pacific regionalism.

     45.     Leaders agreed to delay implementation of the Sustainable Funding Strategy of the
     Secretariat, which updates the membership shares in the 2000 Agreement Establishing the Pacific
     Islands Forum Secretariat tasking further work to be carried out on the new sustainable funding
     arrangements to be implemented, to be tabled at the next meeting. Leaders noted the special
     position of Smaller Island States (SIS), especially their smallness and lack of capacity.


     RENEWAL OF THE SECRETARY GENERAL’S TERM

     46.    Leaders unanimously agreed to reappointing Meg Taylor, DBE, as Secretary General for
     a second, three-year term.


     COUNTRY INITIATIVES

           (a) Insurance Facility
     47.     Leaders considered the concept of a Pacific Island Climate Change Insurance Facility
     (PICCIF) to cover the impacts of Climate Change and noted a taskforce would be established to
     further elaborate it. Leaders further supported the idea that the taskforce would report to the
     Forum Economic Ministers Meeting in 2018 and later to the Leaders meeting.

     48.   Leaders also received an update on the establishment of the PCRAFI initiative which is
     now operational.

           (b) Pacific Connect
     49.     Leaders noted the Pacific Connect initiative of Australia, which aims to forge stronger
     relationships between Pacific and Australian leaders across the public and private sectors.

          (c) Visa fee free Entry (Papua New Guinea)
     50.    Papua New Guinea advised that they are formalising visa fee free entry for all Pacific Island
     Forum members and encouraged members to consider offering similar arrangements to strengthen
     regional integration.

           (d) Upper Air Space and Air Services
     51.     Leaders acknowledged the importance of addressing equitable and accessible air services,
     including maximising benefits of greater ownership of upper airspace management by SIS.
     Leaders further recognised the urgency of addressing air services and upper airspace management
     and the importance of addressing these as separate issues.

                                                                                                       8

55.    Leaders expressed strong solidarity with the Government and people of Antigua and
Barbuda, and the Caribbean region following the destruction and loss of lives in the wake of

Caribbean region and called on the international community to urgently consider the provision of
necessary support and immediate relief supplies.

56.     Leaders recalled the impact of recent cyclones in the Pacific and in particular the
significant destruction to infrastructure and economies of small states. Leaders reiterated the
importance for the international community to recognise the ‘existential threat’ climate change
poses to the Pacific, the Caribbean and throughout the Commonwealth and the critical need to
provide the necessary support as small states continue to adopt resilient and innovate approaches
to pursue a development agenda and to meet the goals of the SDGs.

     5.     Ministers conveyed their condolences to the Government and people of the Republic of

     The Pacific’s political and security environment

     7.      Foreign Ministers discussed a wide range of issues affecting the political and security
     environment of the Pacific, including current shifts in global power relations, challenges to

-----------------------Page 36 End-----------------------

     (ii)     Congratulated the Government and the people of Solomon Islands in ensuring
              the success of RAMSI. Ministers acknowledged RAMSI as a strong example of
              mutual trust and regional cooperation, and committed to harnessing the lessons
              learned. Ministers commended the role of all Forum Members in their
              contributions to RAMSI;

     (iii)    Considered that it was timely to build on the Biketawa Declaration and other
              security related declarations of the Forum. Ministers recommended that Leaders
              initiate consultations on developing a ‘Biketawa Plus’ security declaration, as a
              foundation for future regional responses. Ministers recognised the importance
              of an expanded concept of security inclusive of human security, prioritising
              environmental security and regional cooperation in building resilience to
              disasters and climate change;

              withdraw from the Paris Agreement. Ministers urged the US to remain engaged
              in international efforts to combat climate change. Ministers also agreed that the
              impacts of climate change and environmental degradation could erode
              development gains, undermine economic growth and compound human security
              challenges;

     (vi)     Identified the need for coordinated collective approaches to accessing finance
              to address climate change issues in the region, particularly smaller island states,
              and supported the call by the Prime Minister for Papua New Guinea, on behalf
              of Forum Leaders in 2016, for continued advocacy to multilateral institutions,
              such as the World Bank, to ensure that existing definitions of fragility take into
              account the specific vulnerabilities faced by Forum Island Countries;

     (vii)    Reaffirmed their commitment to collectively promoting peace and stability
              throughout the Pacific region, and expressed continued support for the
              government and people of the Republic of the Marshall Islands in addressing
              the ongoing consequences of nuclear testing. Ministers further stressed the
              importance of upholding the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone established under
              the Rarotonga Treaty and other disarmament and non-proliferation treaties;

     (viii)   Expressed their concern over the instability and current tensions on the Korean
              Peninsula which are the result of the illegal actions by North Korea in violation
              of numerous UN Security Council Resolutions. Ministers particularly expressed
              concern about the threat posed to Guam, which constitutes a threat to the wider
              Pacific region. Ministers called upon all parties to continue dialogue through the
              appropriate diplomatic channels to ease tensions; and

     (ix)     Agreed on the need for a collective Forum foreign policy to address challenges
              and harness opportunities to safeguard the Pacific’s interests.

                    Charter for the Forum Foreign Ministers Meeting (DRAFT)


     Purpose and Role of the Meeting

     1. Forum Leaders have recognised that Foreign Ministers have a key role to play in deepening
        regionalism through strengthening policy cohesion on agreed regional political priorities
        and policy positions, and engaging on these in regional and international fora.

     2. This Charter reflects the decision by Forum Leaders to establish a standing meeting of
        Forum Foreign Ministers (FFMM) and to assist and inform Leaders of relevant regional
        and international issues facing the region.

     3. The purpose and role of the FFMM is to discuss and direct action on:

             foreign policy issues affecting Forum priorities and the pursuit of deeper regionalism;
             regional security and governance issues, including the development and implemen-
              tation of regional norms and standards;
             opportunities presented by regional and international meetings to engage on agreed
              Forum political priorities and policy positions;
             partnership arrangements with non-Forum members, including for example all Forum
              Dialogue partners, relevant inter-governmental organisations and the development of
              relevant multi-stakeholder partnerships;
             applications for membership of the Forum, including admission of Associate
              Members and accreditation as Observers;
             High level international candidacies by Forum members; and
             Ensuring policy coherence and cohesion across regional Ministerial meetings on
              relevant political priorities and policy issues.

     Governance arrangements

     4. The FFMM will be chaired by the relevant Ministerial representative of the incumbent
        Forum Chair. This alignment of chairing arrangements serves to support the Forum Chair
        in their representational responsibilities, which include leading Forum delegations in
        summitries with Forum Dialogue partners and in international conferences and
        negotiations.

     5. The Chair shall manage the meeting and ensure that decisions are recorded in writing.

     6. Forum Foreign Ministers shall receive, examine and comment on recommendations made
        by the Forum Officials Committee and report their meeting outcomes to Forum Leaders,
        through the Secretary General of the Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat.

     7. The FFMM may, as necessary, oversee and task intermittent or ad hoc ministerial, officials
        or multi-stakeholder groups as needed to advance the Forum’s political and security
        interests.

     Mobility and Business Harmonisation do not overlap with similar work as part of the proposed PACER Plus and MSG
     Trade agreements. On the issue of fisheries, Ministers noted the work of the Fisheries Taskforce and the importance
     of supporting their work. Economic Ministers also noted the Framework for Resilient Development in the Pacific
     and stressed the importance of fragility and vulnerability related to climate induced events on issues such as debt
     sustainability.

for the Rights of Persons with Disabilities within national inclusive development policies.

FINANCING FOR DEVELOPMENT

6. Discussions in this session considered how Forum Island Countries (FICs) can access new sources of development
finance, particularly looking at their comparative advantage, planning for increases in development financing and
support from development partners, as well as steps for mobilisation of new sources of development finance based on
the UNDP-PIFS survey. Innovative financing modalities, such as debt for nature swap were identified and Economic
Ministers recognised the importance of incorporating Financing for Development in medium term budgetary
frameworks. Members requested clear guidelines on the specific financing modalities and noted the challenges of

     limited absorptive capacity. Members requested remaining countries to submit their UNDP-PIFS survey responses to
     improve country coverage and strengthen the conclusions of the report.

     7. Members commended the Secretariat for its innovative paper on a Regional Financing Facility. It was highlighted
     that the proposed initiative is a good example of regionalism. However, members noted that more work is needed
     before development of a roadmap. Economic Ministers supported further work on this proposal but suggested a
     process of country consultations to provide advice on areas of work that would be needed before the development of
     a roadmap.

     8. Economic Ministers considered presentations from the World Bank Group and the Asian Development Bank in
     relation to disaster responsive financing instruments and options which encompassed both, ex-post and ex-ante
     instruments for their respective Member States. Ministers also considered an intervention from Australia highlighting
     the effectiveness of humanitarian cash transfers, commending the action of the Fijian Government following Tropical
     Cyclone Winston in 2016. Ministers also noted an update from the Cook Islands on the progress of the Pacific
     Catastrophe Risk Assessment and Financing Initiative and commended the considerable work undertaken to date
     on the initiative. Ministers urged multilateral institutions to adopt similar products – tailored to suit the needs of the
     region.

     9. Economic Ministers considered an update on Members’ efforts to access global climate financing, noting that
     climate finance forms a critical component of financing for development. Ministers also considered an update on
     national climate assessments undertaken to date, noting that with the completion of Palau in the coming month, eight
     FICs would have completed national assessments for climate financing. Ministers welcomed Fiji’s Presidency of the
     COP23 and identified the need to work closely as a region. Ministers also recognised the need for greater focus and
     innovation in the area of climate change adaptation rather than just mitigation.

     the country level before they are presented to the Board, and that the underlying drivers of vulnerability in the Pacific
     and other small island developing states are well considered as part of the framework;
