    For All Who Serve
    NATO’s commitment to safeguarding the freedom and security of all its members
    is made possible by the service of men and women from across its member and
    partner countries.

    In 2016, tens of thousands of Allied service members were deployed on land, in
    the air, and at sea to provide for NATO’s defence and to project stability beyond
    NATO’s borders. Whether engaged in security operations, military exercises, or
    training missions, the security and stability of the Alliance would not be possible
    without their contributions.

    NATO recognises the dedication of all who serve. The Alliance owes a debt
    of gratitude to every man and woman in service for the risks they take and the
    sacrifices they and their families make while serving NATO’s common purposes
    and values.

 Energy Security

 The availability of energy, including supply disruptions or volatile energy prices, can have far-reaching
 security implications. In this context, NATO is working to raise its collective awareness in this area and
 develop its competence in supporting the protection of critical energy infrastructure.

 NATO works to enhance energy efficiency in the military, both with a view to making its armed forces less
 dependent on fossil fuels and to reducing its environmental footprint. NATO’s renewed focus on collective
 defence, through its forward presence, for example, has focused attention on the availability of sustainable
 and resilient energy supplies. As a result, NATO is supporting efforts to improve interoperability, provide
 new means of mobile power generation, and offer new energy-related training courses for the military.
 Through military exercises, NATO is helping to ensure that individual technologies can work seamlessly
 together in a contested environment where conventional energy supplies may be disrupted.

 NATO’s activities in 2016 focused on the way energy and security are increasingly interlinked.

 -- After the successful demonstration of the operational relevance of energy-efficient equipment (for instance
    solar and wind power, smart grids, advanced insulation) at a multinational exercise in 2015, NATO began
    to integrate energy efficiency into its policies and standards.
 -- The North Atlantic Council discussed global energy developments and their security implications with
    prominent energy experts, including EU Commission Vice President Maroš Šefčovič.
 -- NATO conducted its second course on building strategic awareness in relation to energy security at the
    NATO School in Oberammergau, Germany with participants from Allied and partner countries.
 -- NATO worked with the NATO Energy Security Centre of Excellence in Vilnius, Lithuania to organise a
    table-top exercise on protecting critical energy infrastructure, focusing on the impact of electricity supply
    disruption in the Baltic region for national security and defence. The Centre also published several studies
    on Ukraine’s energy challenges after Russia’s illegal annexation of Crimea and developed a “Green Book”
    which provides advice on critical infrastructure protection.

Relations with Russia
Prior to 2014, NATO and Russia had worked to build a partnership, developing dialogue and practical cooperation
in areas of common interest. Following Russia’s illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014, NATO suspended practical
cooperation programmes with Russia. However, political and military channels of communication remain open
and efforts to reduce risk and increase transparency are ongoing.

In response to Russia’s illegal annexation of Crimea as well as increasingly assertive Russian behaviour, NATO
has increased its rotational military presence in the eastern part of the Alliance. NATO’s measures are defensive,
proportionate and in line with international commitments, including the NATO-Russia Founding Act.

At the Summit in Warsaw, NATO leaders reaffirmed that the nature of the Alliance’s relations with Russia and
aspirations for partnership will be contingent on a clear, constructive change in Russia’s actions – demonstrating
compliance with international law and its international obligations and responsibilities. Allies also agreed that
deterrence and defence should be complemented by periodic, focused and meaningful dialogue with a Russia
willing to engage on the basis of reciprocity in the NATO-Russia Council. This is important in order to avoid
misunderstanding, miscalculation and unintended escalation, and to increase transparency and predictability.

The NATO-Russia Council met three times in 2016: in April, in July and in December. At each meeting, the group
discussed the conflict in and around Ukraine including the full implementation of the Minsk Agreements; issues
related to military activities, transparency and risk reduction; and the security situation in Afghanistan, including
the regional terrorist threat.

The Secretary General met with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in February and September. The
Deputy Secretary General maintained regular contact with the Russian Ambassador to NATO throughout the
year, as well as with other Russian officials. NATO’s military leaders have also continued to seek discussion with
their Russian counterparts through existing military channels of communication.



Exercises
In 2016, NATO Allies continued to strictly adhere to the letter and spirit of the Vienna Document. This included
regularly notifying OSCE participating states of exercises, including those below the required threshold of
9,000 troops. Notification of Allied exercises throughout the year allowed Russian observers to visit ten Allied
military exercises, including Cold Response (March, Norway), Joint Warrior (April, United Kingdom), Anakonda
(June, Poland) and Parmenion (October, Greece).

  Within NATO, there are a number of forums in which discussions on arms control, disarmament and non-
  proliferation take place:

  -- the High-Level Task Force on Conventional Arms Control sets arms control policy
  -- the Committee on Proliferation meets in political-military and defence formats to discuss WMD non-
     proliferation efforts and defence against chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear (CBRN) threats
  -- the Special Advisory and Consultative Arms Control, Disarmament and Non-Proliferation Committee is a
     forum for discussion of strategic stability and nuclear transparency
  During 2016, NATO met in the High-Level Task Force on Conventional Arms Control format four times, and
  15 times in subordinate committees. These discussions were not always limited to NATO members: in 2016,
  NATO also consulted partners such as Finland, Georgia and Sweden on arms control matters.

  In 2016, the NATO Committee on Proliferation met more than ten times in various formats to discuss
  WMD/CBRN risks and threats, the implementation of the 2009 NATO comprehensive strategic-level policy
  on WMD/CBRN and to develop policy guidance for NATO’s responses to proliferation. The Committee
  also held partner meetings with Finland, Israel and Sweden on WMD proliferation issues and on recent
  developments in the non-proliferation and nuclear disarmament field in the United Nations (UN) General
  Assembly framework.

end, NATO drafted guidelines in 2016 and convened
a major workshop of experts from Allied and partner
countries and international organisations.

Although Allies have different approaches to the
Arms Trade Treaty, the Ottawa Convention on anti-
personnel mines and the Convention on Cluster
Munitions, they all fully support strengthening global
norms in these areas.

Part of NATO’s contribution involves destruction
of surplus or dangerous materiel. To date, NATO
has helped to destroy 5.2 million anti-personnel
landmines, 44,500 tonnes of various munitions,
2 million hand grenades, 15.9 million cluster sub-
munitions, 1,540 man-portable air defence systems
(MANPADS), 626,000 small arms and light weapons,
164 million rounds of ammunition, 642,000 pieces
of unexploded ordnance, 94,500 surface-to-air
missiles and rockets, 3,530 tonnes of chemicals,

All these activities contribute to a more secure
environment, enhance cooperation between NATO
and partner countries, and integrate individual,
national and regional security.



Weapons of Mass Destruction and
CBRN
NATO is committed to working with Allies, partners,
and other international organisations to combat the
proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMD)
and defend against chemical, biological, radiological
and nuclear (CBRN) threats. In May, NATO held
its annual conference on these issues, gathering
over 100 participants from 44 countries, as well as
high-level representatives from the UN, the EU, the
Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons

      Centres of Excellence

      NATO Centres of Excellence are international military organisations that train and educate
      leaders and specialists from NATO member and partner countries. These Centres are nationally
      or multinationally funded. They are not NATO bodies and are not part of the NATO Command
      Structure. They assist in doctrine development, identify lessons learned, improve interoperability
      and capabilities, and test and validate concepts through experimentation. They offer recognised
      expertise and experience that is of benefit to the Alliance, and support the transformation of
      NATO, while avoiding the duplication of assets, resources and capabilities already present within
      the Alliance.

      NATO’s work in relation to arms control and non-proliferation is supported by a number of these
      NATO-accredited national entities. The Joint CBRN Defence Centre of Excellence in Vyškov
      in the Czech Republic has a new coordination element that ensures the availability of expert
      information and fused CBRN technical and scientific expertise to support NATO commanders
      and their staffs.

      In 2016, the Centre organised nine residential courses for participants from NATO and partner
      countries, supported by speakers from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA),
      the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), and the World Health
      Organization (WHO), among others. A live-agent training funded by the NATO Science for
      Peace and Security Programme took place in October for first responders from Egypt, Jordan
      and Tunisia. It was organised in cooperation with the Centre and reinforced by OPCW trainers.

      The NATO Maritime Interdiction Operational Training Centre in Crete, Greece conducted three
      training courses in May, July and September related to illicit trafficking of CBRN material at sea
      and WMD in maritime interdiction operations.

      In October, the Explosive Ordnance Disposal Centre of Excellence in Trenčin, Slovakia hosted
      the first staff officer training for CBRN explosive ordnance disposal incident management, as well
      as a course on the safe handling and elimination of explosives with a chemical payload, including
      staff procedures and safety considerations for the disposal of chemical weapons.

the fullest range of cyber defence capabilities and
fostering better education, training and exercises.

will be reviewed on an annual basis.

can also benefit from economies of scale. For NATO,




  Highlights of these efforts in 2016 include:

  -- Under the Smart Defence umbrella – an initiative launched in 2012 to facilitate multinational capability
     delivery – Allies completed four projects in 2016, bringing the total number of projects completed to 12.
  -- Through the complementary Evolved Approach to Multinational Cooperation, NATO is pursuing a political,
     top-down approach to fast-track new capability cooperation efforts. This work yielded important results in
     2016:
     •	 Eight Allies signed a Memorandum of Understanding in February 2016 to acquire air-to-ground
        Precision-Guided Munitions (PGM), with a ninth Ally joining in October. The participating Allies have
        already launched the first round of multinational procurement for delivery in 2017-2019 and a second
        round is expected in 2017.
     •	 In the area of Special Operations Aviation, four Allies built on a broader cooperation initiative launched
        in 2015 by adopting a common approach to related training. The Chiefs of Defence of Bulgaria, Croatia,
        Hungary and Slovenia signed an arrangement for the creation of a multinational solution for training
        Special Operations Aviation forces.
     •	 At the Warsaw Summit, Poland and Turkey signed a Letter of Intent on multinational cooperation in the
        area of airborne escort jamming capabilities, the purpose of which is to increase cooperation to help
        protect Allied air assets through jamming of enemy radars and missile systems during Alliance missions.
        Given the high costs of developing this capability as well as the prospect for modular solutions,
        multinational cooperation is a compelling option in this area. It is anticipated that more Allies will join this
        effort in due course.




     The Conference of National Armaments Directors (CNAD) – the senior NATO committee responsible
     for the promotion of armaments cooperation – celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2016. The CNAD
     focuses on enhancing interoperability, facilitating multinational cooperation and overseeing major
     NATO programmes – including the Ballistic Missile Defence programme and the Joint Intelligence,
     Surveillance and Reconnaissance initiative – in order to ensure the delivery of vital capabilities.

Joint Intelligence, Surveillance and
Reconnaissance
The Alliance has long recognised the fundamental
importance of Joint Intelligence, Surveillance and
Reconnaissance (JISR) to its strategic preparedness
and the success of its operations and missions.
However, lessons drawn from recent operations
have highlighted NATO’s limitations when it comes
to building and sharing a common picture based on
data collected by a wide variety of JISR assets.

Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance
(ISR) plays a vital role in all military operations.

achievement. By improving proficiency in collecting,
processing and exchanging intelligence, the system
can provide enhanced situational awareness for the
NATO Response Force.

The JISR trial Unified Vision 2016 in June built
upon these achievements and further evaluated and
demonstrated the breadth of JISR missions. The
trial involved over 400 participants from 17 countries
and took place at ten different locations, including
live and simulated JISR assets.

In October, Luxembourg announced that it will
provide resources for the acquisition of servers to
support the automated sharing of JISR information

  Notable progress in 2016:

  -- In the land domain, progress was made in the areas of soldier-to-soldier situational awareness, jammers
     against radio-controlled improvised explosive devices, improving the ability of NATO forces to operate in
     degraded visual environments, and augmented reality for armoured vehicle survivability.
  -- In the maritime domain, NATO developed standards that will enable the first digital underwater
     communications network, which among other things will provide vastly improved support to autonomous
     and unmanned maritime capabilities. NATO also promoted multiple efforts to reduce shipbuilding costs
     while increasing operational flexibility and interoperability through modular ship design initiatives.
  -- In the air domain, the Alliance continued to improve aircraft survivability through trials on countering
     infra-red and radar-guided threats; efforts related to air-to-air refuelling; work on the development of the
     NATO Suppression of Enemy Air Defence capability; further development of ISR interoperability through
     the Unified Vision trial; and improvements to an Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) capability through
     continued development of NATO standards and a NATO UAS Policy.

     Anti-Submarine Warfare

     Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) is a key capability area in which NATO is pursuing quantitative and
     qualitative improvements in order to keep pace with the evolving threat environment.  In 2016, NATO
     initiated an effort to develop a more consistent, structured and coordinated approach to enhance
     the understanding across NATO of all ongoing and planned efforts related to ASW, as well as their
     interdependence.  This effort highlighted the need for a concept that would help define a common
     “direction of travel” to better align NATO and national initiatives.

     Other NATO ASW-related efforts in 2016 included:

     -- support to seven multinational cooperation projects
     -- experimentation and testing of innovative ASW solutions (for instance next-generation sonar and
        underwater gliders)
     -- development and maintenance of more than ten standards and doctrinal products
     -- sponsorship of over 20 science & technology and industry research projects
     -- conduct of seven large-scale NATO and multinational ASW exercises

    Working with Partners to Develop Policy

    Part of the value of consulting with partners is the development of policies and action plans that Allies
    and partners can take forward together. Policy discussions and negotiations are enriched by the unique
    perspectives that partners bring to the table. In 2016, Allies and partners agreed a number of new
    policies and plans, including:

    -- The 2016-2017 Interoperability Platform Roadmap on Crisis Management and Interoperability. This
       roadmap sets out joint tasks to improve cooperation between NATO and partners on education,
       training, exercises and lessons learned for interoperability.
    -- The NATO 1325 Action Plan, which supports the implementation of UN Security Council Resolution
       1325 and related Resolutions. With this action plan, NATO and partners aim to ensure that the gender
       perspective is mainstreamed into policies, activities and efforts to prevent and resolve conflicts.
    -- The NATO Building Integrity Policy and the accompanying Action Plan. Both support the promotion
       and implementation of integrity, transparency and accountability within Allied and partner countries
       alike to ensure transparent and democratically accountable defence institutions. These include efforts
       to understand corruption as a security risk and its impact on peace and stability.
    -- The NATO Policy on the Protection of Civilians. This covers all efforts to protect civilians from conflict-
       related physical violence and to avoid, minimise and mitigate the negative effects on civilians arising

     Defence and Related Security Capacity Building Trust Fund

     The Defence and Related Security Capacity Building Trust Fund was established in 2015 to provide additional
     support and resources to implement the Initiative. The Trust Fund allows Allies and partners to contribute to
     specific projects developed for recipient countries, as well as to contribute to a financial pool to be used to
     support future projects.

     Since the Trust Fund was established, six Allies (Denmark, Italy, Luxembourg, Norway, Turkey and the United
     Kingdom,) have made financial contributions totalling nearly EUR 4 million. Additionally, five Allies (Germany,
     Italy, Luxembourg, Norway and Turkey) and two partner nations (Finland and Ireland) have promised further
     financial contributions to the Trust Fund. These pledges currently total over EUR 3 million.

     Support to Ukraine

     NATO’s partnership with Ukraine began in 1991 and was strengthened in 1997 with the signing of
     the Charter on a Distinctive Partnership and the establishment of the NATO-Ukraine Commission. In
     response to the Russia-Ukraine conflict, NATO has reinforced its support for capability development and
     capacity-building in Ukraine. At a number of meetings throughout 2016, NATO and Ukraine discussed
     Russia’s continued aggressive actions, the importance of implementing the Minsk Agreements, and
     NATO’s enduring support for Ukraine.

     At the 2016 Warsaw Summit, NATO leaders adopted the Comprehensive Assistance Package for
     Ukraine, which aims to help make the country’s defence and security institutions more effective,
     efficient and accountable. They also reviewed the security situation in eastern Ukraine and Crimea
     and welcomed the Ukrainian government’s plans for reform. As Ukraine continues on its reform path,
     NATO and NATO members will continue to provide strong practical and political support for Ukraine’s
     sovereignty and territorial integrity and for its efforts to build a better future for all Ukrainians.

     Under the Comprehensive Assistance Package, NATO will provide strategic level advice in key areas
     of the security and defence sector reform. Furthermore, 40 tailored support measures have been
     developed in areas such as capacity and institution building, command, control, communications
     and computers (C4), logistics and standardization, defence-technical cooperation, cyber defence,
     energy security, medical rehabilitation, explosive ordnance disposal, improvised explosive devices
     and demining, strategic communications, countering hybrid warfare, security services reform and
     civil emergency planning. Concrete projects are being implemented through NATO capacity-building
     programmes, Trust Funds, and the Science for Peace and Security Programme, among others.

Gender Balance Statistics
At the NATO Summit in Warsaw, Allied leaders welcomed the high-level appointments made in
NATO’s civilian and military structures in 2016, which are firsts in all cases:

-- Allied Joint Force Command Naples Commander Admiral Michelle Howard (USA) in June
-- NATO Defense College Commandant Lieutenant General Christine Whitecross (CAN) in
   September
-- NATO Deputy Secretary Rose Gottemoeller (USA) in October
Allies agreed that there is still more work to be done regarding the representation of women at
NATO. The percentage of women NATO-wide increased to 26% in 2016, whereas the percentage
of women in the International Staff remained at 39%. Women constitute 16% of NATO’s
International Military Staff.

The NATO International Military Staff Office of the Gender Advisor collected data in 2016,
reflecting the status of women in the armed forces in 2015.

-- 85% of NATO members have all positions in their armed forces open to women
-- 11% of armed forces of NATO countries are made up of women, on average
-- 6% of military personnel deployed in NATO operations in 2015 were women
-- 65% of NATO members have support structures in place for single, divorced or widowed parents
   caring for children
-- 62% of NATO members have programmes or policies to encourage work-life balance
-- 52% of NATO members have programmes or measures in place to support parents when both
   are in the armed forces
-- 69% of NATO members have a military entity dealing with gender perspectives

NATO Standardization Office (NSO)
Standardization is critical to the delivery of
interoperable capabilities. In 2016, the Alliance
focused on the identification, development and
implementation of NATO standards directly
supporting agreed defence planning priorities.
Lessons identified have been gathered from NATO’s
increased exercises for Allies’ use in improving
NATO standards and their implementation.
The Alliance agreed a revised NATO Policy for
Standardization representing significant progress
in the area of integration with other agreed NATO
processes, national implementation and timeliness
of standardization.

Headquarters
While NATO is active in many different parts of the
world, its headquarters in Brussels is a forum for
the discussions and consultations that shape NATO
policy and practice.

In addition to housing NATO’s International Staff
and International Military Staff, the Headquarters
is home to 28 Allied delegations and military
representations, 19 partner delegations, and staff
from several of NATO’s Agencies.

In 2016, almost 5,500 meetings were held at NATO
Headquarters. More than half of these required
simultaneous interpretation, usually in NATO’s two
official languages, English and French, but also in
languages used by NATO’s partners, such as Arabic,
Georgian, Macedonian, Montenegrin, Mongolian,
Russian and Ukrainian.

With two official languages, there is high demand
on NATO’s translation service, which is available
to provide official translations of NATO documents
seven days a week, 365 days a year. In 2016, the
translation service received requests to translate,
on average, 143 pages a day – equivalent to an
annual total of more than 15 million words.

Discussions in the North Atlantic Council and its
committees require large numbers of documents,
including agendas, reports, working papers, and
decision sheets. In 2016, the International Staff
circulated nearly 19,000 documents in support of
committee business. The International Staff and the
Committees began using a new electronic records
system in 2010 and went to full electronic distribution
in 2014. The next challenge is to improve electronic
information exchange with NATO’s partners to
reduce the nearly 4,000,000 pages that are still
printed each year.

Preparation for the move to NATO’s new
headquarters continued in 2016. The oxidised steel
sculpture known as the “NATO star” had stood in
front of NATO’s current headquarters since August
1971. It was moved to its new location in May.

Improving Transparency
At the Wales Summit in September 2014, NATO
leaders charged the Organization with improving its
financial transparency and accountability. As part of
a wider effort to be as open as possible, the Alliance
also continues to increase the amount of non-
financial information – both current and historical – it
makes available to the public.

Documents released in 2016 included 13 current
Standardization Agreements relating to Ammunition
Safety, two current documents relating to NATO’s
diversity policies, two current documents from the
Office of the Secretary General concerning the
treatment of civilians, 24 documents relating to the
history of the Conference of National Armaments
Directors in celebration of the 50th anniversary
of the CNAD, and more than 15,000 documents
issued by the North Atlantic Council, the Military
Committee, and their sub-committees in the years
1984-1985.

Efforts to make it easier to access this information
via the NATO website are ongoing, including through
a dedicated module on NATO’s history.9

Defence Expenditure of NATO Countries (2009 – 2016)

NATO collects defence expenditure data from Allies on a regular basis and presents aggregates and subsets of this
information. Each Allied country’s Ministry of Defence reports current and estimated future defence expenditure
according to an agreed definition of defence expenditure. The amounts represent payments by a national government
actually made, or to be made, during the course of the fiscal year to meet the needs of its armed forces or those of Allies.
NATO also makes use of up-to-date economic and demographic information available from the Directorate-General for
Economic and Financial Affairs of the European Commission, and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development. In view of the differences between this definition and national definitions, the figures shown may diverge
considerably from those which are quoted by media, published by national authorities or given in national budgets.
Equipment expenditure includes both spending on major equipment and on Research & Development expenditure
devoted to major equipment. Personnel expenditure includes pensions paid to retirees.
The cut-off date for information used in this report is 15 February 2017. Figures for 2016 are estimates.
