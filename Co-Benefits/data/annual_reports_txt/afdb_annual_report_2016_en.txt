                                                                                        3,380

2.	 Focusing Bank Group Operations on the High 5s




    BOX 1

    A New Deal and a New Initiative
    The Bank’s approval, in May 2016, of the New Deal on Energy for Africa
    2016–2025 and its aspirational target of providing universal energy access
    for Africa by 2025 underlines a commitment to achieve the High 5s priority
    to Light Up and Power Africa (Box Figure 1). Complementing the New
    Deal is the Africa Renewable Energy Initiative. Launched in December
    2015 at COP21, the Initiative seeks to boost Africa’s renewable energy
    generation capacity by 10 GW by 2020. The Bank has been mandated
    by the African Union to host the Initiative’s independent delivery unit
    and to act as a trustee.

    The Initiative also represents a step in Africa’s transition toward inclusive
    and green growth with an appropriate energy mix. The Bank worked with
    governments, the private sector, and bilateral and multilateral agencies to        Egypt’s supercritical thermal stream power plant at Ain Sokhuna

                           Beckie’s Online Vegetable Basket
                           Beckie Nakabugo traces the origins of the Online Vegetable Basket to the miseries sustained by Ugandan farmers at the
                           hands of unscrupulous middlemen, who extract huge profit at their expense. “In Uganda, you cannot sell any perishables
                           without going through a middleman. So it was stressful selling our products”, lamented Beckie. “So we sat down and asked
                           what can really change in our life in order to make agriculture interesting? We came up with the Online Vegetable Basket.”

                           The Basket is a platform that sends order forms to offices, collects orders, then prepares and delivers them—all on a
                           Friday—and “receives cash instantly and happily.” “It is so enjoyable,” says Beckie, “that it has reduced post-harvest losses.”
                           The small group of youth who pioneered the idea has now grown to a dynamic enterprise of 30 officers.

                           Beyond providing direct jobs to youth, the enterprise has given a boost to local farming. “We have created 100 farmer groups
                           and the farmers are enjoying agriculture,” says Beckie. “We have become a better middleman!”

 Visa-free Travel for African Citizens across the Continent
 Free movement of persons is one area of African regional integration where progress has been particularly
 slow and uneven. Still, initiatives are under way. The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS)
 is one of the rare regional economic communities in Africa to include a Protocol on Free Movement of
 Persons, Residence, and Establishment. The first of the three phases foreseen by the Protocol—90-day
 visa-free entry—has been implemented by all ECOWAS countries, and the proposal for a common passport
 has been adopted by about half the membership.

 At continental level, the African Union moved closer to its goal of achieving visa-free travel for African
 citizens across the continent by 2020 when it launched the African Passport in 2016. Receiving his African
 Passport in October 2016, the President of the Bank Group said that the document “will reduce the cost
 of doing business on the continent” and expressed hope that “all the walls that separate us will go down.”

additional finance from public and private sources, and enhancing
the capacities of RMCs to tap global climate finance.

 Kenya—Sustainable Town Water Supply and Sanitation
 The government of Kenya selected the Bank as a partner of choice to
 finance the UA 284.3 million program that improves access to, and quality
 of water supply and wastewater management services in 28 towns. The
 project’s goal is to catalyze commercial activities, drive economic growth,
 create jobs, build resilience against climate variability and change, and
 ultimately improve the quality of life of the people. More than 15,000 new
 jobs are expected to be created during and after construction. The major
 beneficiaries will be eight water service boards, more than 15 water service
 providers, and town residents—with more than 2.1 million benefiting from
 better water supply in 19 towns and more than 1.3 million benefitting from
 better sanitation in 17 towns.
