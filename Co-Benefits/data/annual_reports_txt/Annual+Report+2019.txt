13 percent lower than the 2018 level of UA 4.37 billion,
and lower than the levels in 2016 and 2017 (Figure 2.3).
The decline is due largely to a drop in ADB sovereign
and non-sovereign operations, from UA 3.0 billion                Container ship, Walvis Bay, Namibia
in 2018 to UA 2.51 billion in 2019. The drop in
disbursement volumes on ADB sovereign and
non-sovereign operations is partly a result of the
close monitoring and phasing of disbursements for
fast-disbursing operations in 2019, as Management
sought to preserve the Bank’s triple-A rating pending
the conclusion of negotiations for the Seventh
General Capital Increase (GCI-VII). A revised limit of
UA 2,583 million was set on total ADB disbursements
to maintain the Fitch ratio within prudential levels.
Leveraging on the Bank’s country and regional
presence, Management undertook reforms and
initiatives aimed at addressing these issues and
gradually improving portfolio performance.

     LIGHT UP AND POWER AFRICA


Access to energy is crucial for improving
health and education outcomes, reducing
the cost of doing business, unlocking
economic potential, and creating jobs.
                           Insufficient energy access manifests itself in hundreds of
                           thousands of deaths annually due to the use of wood-
                           burning stoves for cooking. It handicaps the operations of
                           hospitals and emergency services, compromises educational
                           attainment, and drives up the cost of doing business. Energy
                           access for all is thus one of the key drivers of inclusive
                                 growth—creating opportunities for women, youth, and
                                             children in both urban and rural areas.

ARCH Africa Renewable Power Fund, in which the Bank has an equity
stake, reached first close and will provide equity for the development
and construction of 10–15 greenfield renewable energy projects, adding
approximately 533 MW of installed energy generation capacity from
renewable sources in the region. The Redstone 100 MW Concentrated
Solar Power IPP in South Africa, for which the Bank provided a senior loan
and mobilized the remaining debt from nine banks, reached dry financial
close. Another milestone is the newly commissioned Lake Turkana Wind
310 MW IPP in Kenya.

•	 The Board of Governors approved the conversion of the Sustainable
Energy Fund for Africa into a special fund, with significant additional
contributions expected from donors.

          IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF LIFE
          FOR THE PEOPLE OF AFRICA


Africa’s growth and entry into higher value-
added areas of production and competitiveness
will enable Africans to develop their potential,
escape poverty, and support the continent’s
trajectory toward inclusive growth and
economic transformation.

Approvals for Improve the Quality of Life for the
People of Africa totaled UA 1.67 billion (23 percent of
total approvals), compared with UA 2.38 billion in 2018.

Water and sanitation
Approvals for water and sanitation totaled UA 334.5
million in 2019. They support one regional operation,
cutting across Malawi and Tanzania, and 12 country
operations to provide access to improved water and
sanitation for an estimated 7.4 million people as well as
create 6,400 jobs. These multisectoral projects aim to
expand water supply and sanitation services; improve
water resource management for productive use,
disaster risk management, and ecosystem integrity; and
strengthen institutional and human capacity. Projects
in urban and rural areas as well as at the national and
regional levels target the needs of the poor, including
women, children, youth, and vulnerable groups.
Approvals in 2019 will support, among others:

•	 The Program for Integrated Rural Sanitation in Upper

expanding ADB non-sovereign operations and its support for private
sector development in ADF countries, using ADB re-sources to more
actively promote ADF countries’ graduation to blend and ADB status, and
increasing ADB resources for regional integration projects that benefit ADB
and ADF countries alike. This will ensure that not only will lending levels to
ADB countries rise, but also ADF countries will see tangible benefits from
their increased capital subscriptions. Further information on the program of
reforms supported by GCI-VII is in Appendix 10.

ADF-15 replenishment
At their final meeting in Pretoria, South Africa, on 4–5 December 2019 and
in subsequent announcements, the Deputies reached agreement on the
15th replenishment of the African Development Fund (ADF-15). They agreed
on an ADF-15 resource level of UA 5.6 billion for the three-year operational
period 2020–2022. Three RMCs—Angola, Egypt, and South Africa—pledged
contributions to ADF-15.
                                                                                 Raising of the La Gogue Dam under the
Addressing the roots of fragility and improving resilience were confirmed        Mahe Sustainable Water Augmentation
as key ADF-15 priorities, with a 26.4 percent increase in resources allocated    Project in Seychelles
to the Transition Support Facility (TSF). Management also agreed with ADF
donors to replenish the ADF Project Preparation Facility with UA 75 million
and to increase the Regional Operations Envelope from 21 percent to 25
percent of the total resources available for commitment. Finally, donors
confirmed the relevance of the Private Sector Credit Enhancement Facility
in low-income countries, particularly in transition states, and approved an
additional allocation of UA 100 million. Further information on commitments
under ADF-15 is provided in Appendix 11.

                                          Trust funds
                                          The Bank continues to engage with traditional and emerging donors,
                                          including foundations, to mobilize additional resources across various themes
                                          and sectors. The Bank launched two new trust funds in 2019—the Urban
                                          and Municipal Development Fund (UMDF) and the Africa Digital Finance
                                          Inclusion Facility (ADFI)—and a number of others are in the pipeline. The
                                          UMDF is a timely response to the challenges of rapid urbanization in Africa
                                          and the strong need for integrated city planning expertise. The ADFI is a
                                          new innovative financing vehicle designed to accelerate digital financial
                                          inclusion across Africa. In addition, high-value legacy bilateral funds—the
                                          Korea-Africa Economic Cooperation and the Nigeria Technical Cooperation
                                          Fund—are being extended to provide direct support to the Bank and its
                                          RMCs. The Bank continues to explore options to better rationalize the use of
                                          thematic trust funds (such as the efforts to merge several funds in the water
                                          sector) and innovative partnerships with regional organizations (such as the
                                          NEPAD Infrastructure Project Preparation Facility), in support of the Bank’s
                                          operational priorities.

                                          In 2019, the Bank mobilized UA 174.3 million from multidonor and
                                          bilateral trust funds, almost double the UA 90 million target (Table 3.1). This
                                          performance is driven largely by the contributions to the Affirmative Finance
                                          Action for Women in Africa (AFAWA) from the Netherlands
                                          (UA 49.1 million) and the Women Entrepreneurs Finance Initiative
                                          (UA 44.6 million). Management will continue engaging potential donors
                                          and conducting awareness and campaigns to user departments in order
                                          to improve the mobilization and utilization of trust fund resources.

External representation
In 2019, the Asia External Representation Office
emphasized development needs in Africa, the Bank’s
High 5 priorities, and the importance of the Africa
Investment Forum, particularly through the Seventh
Tokyo International Conference on African Development
(TICAD7) and the First China–Africa Economic and
Trade Expo. At TICAD7—attended by representatives
of 53 African states, including 42 Heads of State—the
President of the Bank strongly urged Japan’s business
community to invest in the continent. Together with
the Senior Management of the Bank, the Bank’s
delegation to TICAD7 emphasized the importance of
investing in Africa to support development. The Office                    Tokyo International Conference on African Development, Japan

The meetings culminated in the endorsement by the GCC, at its 19th
Meeting, of a “Programme of Priority Reforms,” structured around 35 actions
and designed to achieve seven strategic objectives:

1.	 Increase the strategic alignment and operational focus on the High 5s.

2.	 Improve the quality and development impact of operations.

3.	 Increase the effectiveness of policy dialogue.

4.	 Strengthen the African Development Bank’s capacity to deliver
    on its mandate.

Standing Committees of the Boards
To ensure the effectiveness of their operations, the Boards work through
seven standing committees and delegate certain responsibilities to them
(Figure 4.1 and Appendix 9). The committees conduct exhaustive reviews of
matters within their areas of competence and make recommendations to the
Boards as appropriate. Each committee also oversees the performance of
the various organizational units related to its responsibility.

                                     The mission of Independent Development Evaluation (BDEV) is to help the
                                     African Development Bank foster sustainable growth and poverty reduction
                                     in Africa through independent and influential evaluations of its strategies,
                                     policies, and operations. Since the first evaluation unit was set up at the Bank
                                     40 years ago, the function has grown in scope, scale, and depth alongside
                                     the Bank, taking on greater challenges. In 2019, BDEV conducted evaluations
                                     and facilitated knowledge-sharing events and capacity development activities
                                     in more than 26 countries. It delivered 13 evaluation products, including an
                                     evaluation manual, contributing to learning and accountability for achieving
                                     the Bank’s High 5 priorities.

                                     The independent evaluation of the Bank’s implementation of its Development
                                     and Business Delivery Model was the most influential. It was presented to
                                     the Board of Governors at the 2019 Annual Meetings and informed the
                                     discussions on a general capital increase for the Bank and the replenishment
                                     of the African Development Fund. Corporate evaluations also assessed
                                     the Middle-Income Countries Technical Assistance Facility and the Bank’s

   The subscription position, including the distribution of voting rights, reflects the differences in the timing of subscription payments by member countries. After all shares created
by the Bank have been fully subscribed and paid for, the regional and non-regional groups are expected to hold 60 percent and 40 percent voting rights, respectively.
b.
   Slight differences may occur in totals due to rounding.

Appendix 9:
Oversight Activities of the Board’s Committees

Board effectiveness: Committee on Administrative Matters concerning the Board (AMBD)
AMBD considers issues related to policies and administrative procedures concerning members of the Boards of Directors,
their Alternates, Senior Advisers, and Advisers. In 2019, the committee initiated discussions on potential amendments to
the regulations governing the employment of Senior Advisers and Advisers of Board constituency offices. It also considered
reports from the various consultation missions and study tours, the outcomes of which were expected to be considered in
joint AMBD/CODE sessions and to provide strategic input into the development of Country Strategy Papers. AMBD also
reviewed instruments to enhance the effectiveness of the Boards, including a Boardroom and Meetings Guide.

Accountability and risk management: Audit and Finance Committee (AUFI)
AUFI oversees the Bank Group’s finances, accounting, risk management, internal controls, and institutional integrity. In
2019, the Committee reviewed reports of several audits as well as the Audit Action Plan for Country/Regional offices. It
continued to provide effective oversight and monitoring of the implementation of audit recommendations, the adminis-
trative budget, the 2019 lending program, Special Operations Unit Portfolio, group risk management, reports on capital
adequacy and exposure, and market risks. Together with CAHR, AUFI reviewed and provided input into proposed revi-
sions—in line with GCI-VII and ADF-15 commitments—to the cost sharing formula, used to reasonably allocate shared
expenses among the Bank Group’s three legally distinct entities (ADB, ADF, and NTF), and to the cost-to-income ratio, a
strategic measure of the Bank’s operational efficiency in managing its resources, which serves as an indicator of the Bank’s
financial sustainability. AUFI also reviewed and cleared the work plans of independent accountability units reporting to it,
including PAGL and PIAC.

Staff welfare and corporate efficiency: Committee on Administrative and Human Resource Issues (CAHR)
CAHR considers policies and issues related to the Bank Group’s general administration and human resources (HR). In 2019,
it provided strategic guidance on the internal administration of justice to enhance the rule of law and accountability. It also
continued discussions on the Bank's real estate footprint in Abidjan as well as the long-term strategy for the acquisition and
management of real estate for Regional and Country Offices as part of the decentralization action plan. CAHR provided
strategic input toward implementing a roadmap and action plan for HR-related initiatives for 2019 and beyond. The action
plan includes conducting a staff survey, revising staff regulations, refining the performance management framework, devel-
oping a people management strategy, and strengthening the HR function. In addition, the Committee initiated discussions
on other initiatives such as right-sizing the organization and coming up with a new total compensation framework.

Focus on results and impact: Committee on Operations and Development Effectiveness (CODE)
CODE assesses the Bank Group’s development effectiveness, guides its strategic directions, and monitors the quality and
results of its operations. In 2019, it reviewed several evaluations of Country Offices, performance of the portfolio, and the
mid-term review of the Bank Group’s Ten-Year Strategy (2013–2022). It also reviewed and provided significant input into a
variety of operational documents, including the draft Central Africa Ten-Year Strategy; the Regional Integration Strategy
Paper (2019–2025); the Quality Assurance Implementation Plan (2019–2021); proposed amendments to the Independent
Evaluation Policy; draft Country Strategy Papers (CSPs) for Burundi, Cabo Verde, Eswatini, Ghana, Kenya, Liberia, Mauritius,
Namibia, South Sudan, and Tanzania; and updated Country Strategy Papers for Algeria, Democratic Republic of Congo, and
Egypt; and a country brief for Zimbabwe. CODE ensured that the Country Strategy Paper-related instruments were aligned
with each country’s socio-economic development priorities, focused on inclusion as well as selectivity, and addressed eco-
nomic diversification, climate change, engagement with the private sector, fragility, gender mainstreaming, and regional
integration. CODE also oversaw the recruitment of a new Evaluator General. In addition, it reviewed and cleared the work
plans of independent accountability units reporting to it, including BCMR and BDEV.

Appendix 9:
Oversight Activities of the Board’s Committees (continued)

Client orientation and stakeholder management: External Communications and Preparation of the Bank
Group Annual Meetings (ECAM)
ECAM oversees the Bank Group’s external communications and preparations of the Annual Report and Annual Meetings. In
2019, it provided strategic direction toward developing a draft Bank Group Communication and External Relations Strategy
2019–2022. It also oversaw the successful convening of the Annual Meetings of the Bank Group in Malabo, Republic of
Equatorial Guinea. ECAM also provided direction for preparing the 2019 African Economic Outlook.

Fostering an ethical culture: Committee for the Enforcement of the Code of Conduct for Executive
Directors (ECBD)
ECBD enforces the Code of Conduct for Executive Directors, which applies to Executive Directors, the President of the
Bank Group, and the Senior Advisers and Advisers of Executive Directors. In 2019, no cases were referred to the committee.

Cost effectiveness and efficiency: Committee of the Whole on the Budget (CWHOLE)
In 2019, in line with its mandate, CWHOLE conducted mid-term and end-of-year reviews of the performance reports on
implementing the budget and the work program. It also reviewed and shaped the strategic orientations for the three-year
work program and budget framework paper (2020–22) for consideration by the Boards.

Appendix 10:
GCI-VII Program of Priority Reforms

The Bank has a clear mission—to promote inclusive and green growth and address Africa’s development challenges by
implementing the High 5 strategies. With its unique mandate and position in Africa’s development finance architecture, the
Bank is exceptionally well placed to support African countries in its areas of comparative advantage.
The GCI-VII Program of Priority Reforms aims to strengthen the Bank’s ability to realize this mission and to maximize its
ability to use additional capital resources effectively. The program outlines the critical steps the Bank will take over the next
five years to achieve seven objectives, as summarized in the matrix below:

Appendix 10:
GCI-VII Program of Priority Reforms (continued)

Each of these objectives will be achieved through clearly defined actions and time-bound deliverables. The actions and
deliverables consider lessons learned by Management in implementing the Development and Business Delivery Model
(DBDM). They are also informed by the findings and recommendations made by the DBDM evaluation commissioned by
Governors at the Busan Annual Meetings in 2018.
For the purposes of internal monitoring, the Bank will establish a tracking sheet and a dashboard, setting out the status of
each action and indicating whether each commitment is on track. This information will be presented to Senior Management
each month, allowing Senior Management to undertake additional actions required to accelerate progress. This dashboard
will also provide a means for biannual updates to the Board of Directors.
The Bank will prepare an overall progress report, providing a narrative report on the status of planned actions under each
commitment and an overall assessment of progress towards the intended impacts. This report will be supplemented by
data from the Bank Group’s Annual Development Effectiveness Review (ADER), which tracks progress in several relevant
areas, such as staffing issues and organizational efficiency. The report will be approved by the Board of Directors and trans-
mitted to the Board of Governors for discussion at the Annual Meetings.
The implementation of these reforms will be assessed at mid-term through an independent evaluation scheduled to start
in 2024. To this end, the Board of Directors—through its approval of the Work Program of the Bank’s Independent Devel-
opment Evaluation Department (BDEV)—will ask BDEV to evaluate the extent to which the Bank delivers on the actions
to which it has committed in the context of GCI-VII. BDEV will submit its report to the Board of Directors for approval, and
the report will also be discussed with the Board of Governors. The formulation of this program of actions was informed by
learning from the previous evaluation covering GCI-VI commitments. Compared with those commitments, this program sets
out more clearly what the actions are intended to achieve or contribute to, with a focus at a strategic level.8 This will provide
an opportunity for the Bank, its Board of Directors, and the Board of Governors to take stock and adjust course if necessary.

Appendix 11:
ADF-15 Strategic and Operational Priorities

The theme for ADF-15 is Creating an Enabling Environment for Inclusive and Sustainable Growth and Transformation,
Decent Jobs, and Greater Resilience (Figure A11.1). The Ten-Year Strategy and the High 5s will continue to guide the ADF’s
operations, but activities over the cycle will be more selective, respond more closely to countries’ priorities, and focus more
intently on high-impact areas. Deputies agreed that while the High 5s are an ambitious and aspirational set of goals for
Africa and the Bank Group, their achievement does not depend on the Bank Group alone. They also agreed that while the
High 5s should anchor ADF-15, there is a need to focus the replenishment on even more selective high-value objectives.

Appendix 11:
ADF-15 Strategic and Operational Priorities (continued)

Under this general strategic umbrella, Deputies thus agreed on two strategic pillars for ADF-15—quality and sustainable
infrastructure and capacity building:
•	 Pillar I: Quality and sustainable infrastructure to support decent job creation and economic transformation and integra-
   tion. Infrastructure—most notably transport, renewable energy, agriculture, and water and sanitation—that promotes
   sustainable development and regional integration.
•	 Pillar II: Governance, human, and institutional capacity for inclusive and sustainable transformation and decent job cre-
   ation. Capacity development that supports the delivery of quality and sustainable infrastructure while enabling Africans
   to participate in job opportunities for inclusive growth.
The two pillars are linked operationally and strategically. Pillar I will focus on “hard physical quality and sustainable infra-
structure” to support economic transformation across the High 5s, albeit in a selective manner. Achieving Pillar I effectively
and efficiently requires investing in “soft infrastructure,” which will be done under Pillar II by building institutional capacity,
improving infrastructure procurement, promoting an enabling environment for private sector involvement in infrastructure
financing, and enhancing vocational skills development for decent job creation via infrastructure and its maintenance.
The ADF-15 strongly supports the cross-cutting themes of fragility, gender, governance, climate change, and private sector
development, which will be essential to inclusive growth and sustainable transformation, decent jobs, and greater resilience.
These themes are not viewed as stand-alone initiatives but are central to the operations, directly influencing how projects
are developed, prepared, and implemented. Mitigating the root causes of fragility and vulnerability will be key during the
three-year cycle, with a view to creating an enabling environment for private sector development, youth, women, and job
creation, thus combating irregular migration as well as regional sources of insecurity.
To deliver on its strategic agenda, the ADF-15 has elaborated a matrix of policy commitments that will drive its actions
during the three-year cycle. The matrix of policy commitments aims at setting objectives and measurable commitments
to strengthen ADF’s accountability as well as its contribution to poverty reduction and economic and social development.
These commitments are designed to be cost-effective and based on SMART indicators (strategic, measurable, attainable,
relevant, and timebound). Some commitments are common to the Bank’s Seventh General Capital Increase (GCI-VII).
The commitments revolve around institutional priorites and cross-cutting themes of fragility, gender, governance, climate
change, and private sector development. Gender and climate change commitments have been mainstreamed and embed-
ded throughout the different sections of the commitment matrix.
Management will track the implementation of the commitments during the cycle and issue a progress report to Deputies
during the ADF-15 mid-term review and the Annual Meetings.
