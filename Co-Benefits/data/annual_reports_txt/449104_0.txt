Thomas Greminger, OSCE Secretary General, at the Economic and Environmental Dimension Implementation Meeting, Vienna, 14 October 2019. (OSCE/Micky Kroell)

Message from the
Secretary General
In yet another challenging year for European security, the
OSCE continued in 2019 to offer participating States a
unique platform for inclusive security dialogue and joint
action.

disturbing trends undermine our common security and
stand in the way of our joint ambition to protect and improve
the lives of our citizens. They need to be addressed with
renewed rigour.

Last year, many complex and interrelated security
challenges continued to beset our region: growing divisions
within and between states; armed conflict; terrorism; violent
extremism and trafficking of drugs, arms and people;
as well as heightened risks related to climate change.
To find sustainable solutions to these challenges, OSCE
participating States need to work together and engage in
genuine dialogue.

Dialogue is an integral part of the OSCE’s DNA. In 2019, the
Structured Dialogue initiative allowed for further constructive
discussion on military transparency, risk reduction and
incident prevention. Significantly, it has continued to foster
military-to-military contacts, which have become so rare
in other forums. If OSCE participating States manage to
maintain the positive momentum of these discussions,
incremental progress appears possible.

Despite unequivocal OSCE human rights commitments, civil
society and independent media continued to experience
severe restrictions in a number of participating States, and
manifestations of intolerance, xenophobia, hate speech and
hate crime continued to spread in the OSCE area. These

Increasing opportunities for dialogue can help us to find
ways to move from confrontation to co-operation. Cyber/
ICT security is a good example of a shared concern, where
taking small but concrete steps towards joint goals has
been possible. Implementation of the 16 OSCE cyber/

4

OSCE ANNUAL REPORT 2019

-----------------------Page 6 End-----------------------

ICT confidence-building measures progressed further last
year. This can help rebuild trust, which is a prerequisite for
reducing tensions and preventing conflict.
The OSCE’s rich institutional fabric offers distinct
expertise in multiple areas of comprehensive security. The
complementary efforts of our network of 16 field operations,
our institutions, the Parliamentary Assembly and the
specialized departments in the Secretariat help to prevent
conflict, manage crises, strengthen resilience to challenges
that undermine stability and promote the rule of law and
respect for human rights.
Last year saw a number of encouraging developments in
different parts of the OSCE region. The agreement between
Skopje and Athens, ending a long-standing dispute,
gives hope for diplomacy, contributes to regional stability
and promotes reconciliation. In Central Asia, we saw the
continuation of a welcome trend towards greater openness
for regional co-operation. This affords the OSCE new
opportunities to support the ambitious agendas of Central
Asian governments on issues such as youth, economic
connectivity, good governance, water management and
countering violent extremism. Last year, we also stepped
up co-operation with Armenia through the comprehensive
and cross-dimensional Armenia Co-operation Programme,
which offers a useful model for support in other participating
States without an OSCE presence.
Meanwhile, new dynamics in and around Ukraine offer
renewed hope for conflict resolution. Although the situation
remains fragile, the opening of the rebuilt section of the
bridge at Stanytsia Luhanska on 20 November carries
great symbolic and humanitarian value. Throughout the
year, the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine kept
the international community informed about developments
on the ground and played an important role in easing the
hardship of civilians on both sides of the contact line. The
Mission stands ready to support further steps towards
disengagement through dialogue facilitation, reporting and
verification.
In the South Caucasus, we saw yet another demanding
year for both the Geneva International Discussions and the
Minsk Process. The OSCE stays strongly committed to its
role in co-chairing the Geneva International Discussions
and fully supports the OSCE Minsk Group Co-Chairs in
their ongoing efforts. In the Republic of Moldova, a lot of
hard work went into building on earlier tangible results in the
Transdniestrian Settlement Process. Further confidencebuilding efforts are essential.
Throughout the year, I continued to advocate for
strengthening the OSCE’s organizational effectiveness and
responsiveness. This includes improving the Secretariat’s
ability to provide strategic support to the Chairmanship,
Troika and participating States and enhancing the OSCE’s
impact in the field. Empowering young people has emerged
as a key priority, and we are paying greater attention to
engaging with youth and integrating their perspectives into
our work.

Budget reform, human resources policies and the use of
technology continue to be priorities for strengthening the
OSCE’s ability to deliver. Secretariat management reform
has produced tangible efficiencies in our internal processes,
and I will continue to seek further improvements.
Ensuring the effective running of the Organization also
involves efforts to maintain a professional working
environment for all OSCE staff. This notably requires equal
representation between women and men across all levels
of the Organization and I have made it a personal priority to
improve the representation of women in decision-making
positions. I am also committed to zero tolerance for any
form of harassment, including sexual harassment, and
to preventing serious violations of OSCE staff rules in the
workplace.
Over the past year, we continued our efforts to put
effective multilateralism into practice, including through
intensified co-operation with other international and regional
organizations. I am particularly happy about the longoverdue update and expansion of our co-operation with
the United Nations as a key strategic partner on the conflict
cycle and many other operational issues. Further developing
our external relations, including with our Mediterranean and
Asian Partners for Co-operation, helps us to maximize our
impact and work towards common goals.
In response to manifest interest on the part of many
participating States and as a means to strengthen synergies
with both state and non-state partners, we are increasingly
highlighting the multiple linkages between the OSCE
agenda and the UN Sustainable Development Goals.
Following on from an OSCE Security Days event that I
convened on the subject, we are conducting a systematic
mapping exercise as a first step towards a more joined-up
approach to tackling global issues that affect our common
security.
The opportunities and risks associated with new
technologies, digitalization and artificial intelligence was
another prominent theme last year. The impact of rapid
technological development, including in changing the nature
of conflict, will be a critical part of our thinking on security as
we move forward.
I thank the 2019 Slovak OSCE Chair and Troika members
Italy and Albania for their co-operation and leadership last
year. I am grateful to all the women and men who, through
their daily work for the OSCE, help to prevent conflict,
strengthen security and promote peace throughout our
region.

The OSCE Chairmanship is selected by the OSCE Ministerial
Council for a one-year term. The post of Chairpersonin-Office is held by the foreign minister of the selected
participating State.

For People, Dialogue and Stability

Chairperson-in-Office: Miroslav Lajčák
www.osce.org/chairmanship

Slovakia took over the Chair of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe
(OSCE) at a time when the Organization was in more need of dialogue and multilateralism
than ever. Indeed, the situation at the end of the second decade of the 21st century looked
bleak: a dire global and regional security environment; participating States turning away
from co-operation while seeing themselves confronted with new and emerging threats
too big for one country alone; voices spreading hate speech, intolerance and nationalist
rhetoric getting louder.
Believing that the OSCE, as the most inclusive and comprehensive regional security
organization in the world, has stood the test of time and that it continues to provide
a unique forum for open dialogue, preventing and settling conflicts, building mutual
understanding and fostering co-operation to provide for a more secure, peaceful and
prosperous future for all people, the Slovak OSCE Chair stood ready to respond to the
challenges of a changing world. But at the same time, the Chairmanship could not ignore
that the most vulnerable people continue to suffer and that the fundamental – and crucial –
principles that underpin the OSCE’s work are under increasing threat. Therefore, Slovakia
focused on small, realistic but important steps to make life easier for people on the ground,
and worked tirelessly to promote the OSCE’s principles and commitments, which – if
implemented – hold the key to lasting security and stability in Europe.

“The Organization for Security and Co-operation
in Europe was created to help participating States
overcome Cold War divisions and move towards
a more secure, peaceful and prosperous future
– for the benefit of all. Central to the OSCE’s
foundation was something very simple: the idea
that, when states come together to talk and to
co-operate on the basis of agreed principles and
commitments, conflict can be prevented, and life
can get better for people. Yet today, we are in
more need of dialogue and multilateralism than
ever.”
Miroslav Lajčák
OSCE Chairperson-in-Office and Slovak Foreign
and European Affairs Minister

PUTTING PEOPLE FIRST – IN RESOLVING AND
PREVENTING CONFLICTS, PROVIDING FOR A
SAFER FUTURE AND PROMOTING EFFECTIVE
MULTILATERALISM
Dialogue, multilateralism and co-operation are key
ingredients for resolving ongoing conflicts and preventing
new ones; for providing solutions to phenomena such
as terrorism, radicalization and violent extremism leading
to terrorism, cyber threats and climate change; and for
bringing about real change in people’s lives. Committed
to using its year at the helm of the OSCE to advance all
three of these ingredients, the Slovak Chair decided to
focus its activities for people, dialogue and stability on three
overarching priorities.

for a political solution to the crisis in and around Ukraine.
Through its Special Representative in Ukraine and in
the TCG, Ambassador Martin Sajdik, the Chairmanship
contributed to regular output-oriented discussions on the
implementation of all aspects of the Minsk agreements
and to the achievement of concrete agreements such as
on the disengagement of forces and hardware and also
on ceasefires. In December, Chairperson-in-Office Lajčák
announced the appointment of Ambassador Heidi Grau to
succeed Ambassador Sajdik.

1. Supporting the resolution and prevention of
conflict, and mitigating its impact on people
With a primary focus on people, the Slovak Chair found
ways to take small steps forward in conflict settings.
The crisis in and around Ukraine was at the top of the
Slovak agenda. On his very first trip in early January,
OSCE Chairperson-in-Office and Slovak Foreign and
European Affairs Minister Miroslav Lajčák visited Kyiv and
eastern Ukraine. Early in the year, the OSCE Chair invested
considerable efforts in proposing, discussing and actively
advocating for nine tangible confidence-building measures
dealing with issues like improving the situation with regard
to checkpoints, facilitating the exchange of detainees,
boosting humanitarian demining and, importantly, repairing
the damaged section of the bridge in Stanytsia Luhanska.
Throughout 2019, OSCE Chairperson-in-Office Lajčák
demonstrated that the OSCE is engaged in crisis settings at
the highest level. He underpinned his personal commitment
to a peaceful political solution to the crisis in and around
Ukraine and to the OSCE’s indispensable role in monitoring
and mediation during four visits to Ukraine, including two
to the now reconstructed bridge in Stanytsia Luhanska,
and by welcoming developments that give hope for future
progress from the endorsement of the text of the Steinmeier
formula in the Trilateral Contact Group (TCG), to a restart of
demining activities or long-delayed exchange of detainees,
and ultimately the Normandy Four meeting at the leadership
level at the end of the year.
The Slovak Chair not only ensured a smooth transition
between the outgoing Chief Monitor of the Special
Monitoring Mission to Ukraine (SMM), Ambassador Ertuğrul
Apakan, and the incoming Chief Monitor, Ambassador
Yaşar Halit Çevik, but also urged all parties to ensure the
safety and security of the monitors, and to implement the
provisions of the Minsk agreements as the framework
8

Other conflicts and settlement processes were also
placed high on the Chairmanship agenda in 2019. While
the Slovak Chair aimed to strengthen OSCE formats for
conflict resolution, to improve the living conditions of people
affected by conflict and to encourage dialogue among
OSCE mediators through retreat such as a ‘Mediation Hub’,
he also intensified efforts to create conditions allowing
further steps to be taken towards a resolution of other
conflicts in the OSCE area.
Chairperson-in-Office Lajčák appointed the experienced
diplomats Ambassador Andrzej Kasprzyk, as his Personal
Representative on the conflict dealt with by the OSCE
Minsk Conference, and Ambassador Rudolf Michalka, as
his Special Representative for the South Caucasus, as well
as the politician and Judge Franco Frattini as his Special
Representative for the Transdniestrian settlement process.
Throughout 2019, the Chairperson-in-Office remained in
close contact with all his representatives and was briefed
regularly. In all three areas, some positive developments
were achieved, such as continued discussions on further
measures to reduce tensions and maintain an atmosphere
conducive to peace facilitated by the Minsk Group;
Slovakia’s engagement through the Geneva International
Discussions and the Incident Prevention and Response
Mechanisms to promote stability and de-escalation; or
the 5+2 meeting in Bratislava in October 2019, which took
stock of the Berlin Plus confidence-building measures and
outlined an implementation phase with prospects for further
progress in the months to come.
During his visits to all conflict-affected regions in the
first three months of 2019, Chairperson-in-Office Lajčák
underlined his personal commitment to the OSCE’s efforts
to resolve these conflicts and explored possibilities for
further steps towards building trust and encouraging
dialogue.
2. Providing for a safer future
From day one, the Slovak Chair understood that rapid
technological change, digitalization and innovation both
hold immense opportunities and pose major security risks.

OSCE ANNUAL REPORT 2019

-----------------------Page 10 End-----------------------

“I firmly believe that the OSCE has an irreplaceable role
in bringing the dream of lasting peace in Europe to life.
During the year as Chair, I visited 15 field missions in
the first six months of our Chairmanship, and I saw the
vast potential the OSCE holds. Visiting the missions, I
witnessed field teams working side by side with local civil
society, governments and young people, as partners and
friends. The field missions are one of the greatest assets
this Organization has.”

Engaging Youth for a Safer Future, 28 October 2019. (MFA Slovakia/Tomáš Bokor)

To work towards a safer future for all, the Slovak Chair
aimed to advance the security and prosperity of the people
in the OSCE region across all dimensions. This included
engaging with young people during all official visits and
involving them in all events, as well as organizing an OSCEwide Youth Forum in Bratislava in October to generate
policy recommendations on how to better engage young
women and men in the OSCE’s work; strengthening
tolerance and non-discrimination through dedicated events
in Vienna and Bratislava; using the OSCE toolbox to prevent
and counter terrorism, as well as violent extremism and
radicalization leading to terrorism (VERLT) as an important
topic of the OSCE-wide Counter-Terrorism Conference in
Bratislava in March; promoting sustainable development,
education and energy co-operation through Slovakia’s
work in the economic and environmental dimension;
managing enhanced connectivity and cybersecurity, among
other things, during the OSCE-wide conference on cyber/
ICT security for a safer future in June; enhancing good
governance and accountability by promoting nationally
led security sector governance and reform (SSG/R) in
the OSCE through dedicated events in Vienna, regional
workshops and a high-level conference in Bratislava in
September; and putting a spotlight on exchanging best
practices and lessons learned on how to better involve
women across the different areas of the OSCE’s work,
ranging from contributions in the field to mediation or
climate action.
3. Ensuring effective multilateralism
Since its very beginning, the OSCE, as the largest
regional security organization under Chapter VIII of the UN
Charter, has been an example of multilateralism in action.
It is Slovakia’s firm belief that no one country alone can
overcome the challenges Europe or, indeed, the world
is facing today – whether it be terrorism, cross-border
conflict or climate change – without stronger multilateral
co-operation. As diverse as the 57 participating States
of the OSCE region are, all of them – from Vancouver to
Vladivostok – are experiencing common problems. But
multilateralism requires commitment and compromise to
reach consensus from all 57. And at a time when the world
and the region are in urgent need of co-operation, attempts
to weaken multilateral systems are commonplace.
In 2019, the Slovak OSCE Chair supported strategic
complementary partnerships within this multilateral
landscape – from regional organizations, like the European
Union, to the United Nations. This included involving
multilateral speakers in events organized by the Slovak
Chair, promoting the OSCE in other formats (UN, EU,
Council of Europe) and achieving specific outcomes
such as issuing a joint statement with the UN Secretary

Meeting dedicated to effective multilateralism.
PROMOTING DIALOGUE
As an underlying component of all its efforts in 2019, the
Slovak Chair sought new and innovative ways of spurring
real and interactive dialogue on all levels to ultimately rebuild
trust and promote co-operation in addressing existing, new
and emerging security challenges.
To encourage inclusive political dialogue, the Slovak Chair
organized an Informal Ministerial Gathering in the High
Tatras, where 23 foreign ministers, 11 deputy foreign
ministers, political representatives and ambassadors from
the OSCE participating States discussed the role and
relevance of the OSCE in the future of prevention and its
place in the global multilateral landscape under the theme
“From past action to future prevention: the OSCE’s niche
in fostering stability in Europe and beyond”. To lay the
groundwork for a productive and interactive discussion
in the High Tatras, the OSCE Chairperson-in-Office
convened small-group Chair’s Dialogues with Viennabased permanent representatives. The approach bore
fruit. Ministers came without prepared statements, and,
as a main takeaway, participating States reconfirmed the
relevance of the OSCE for European Security and voiced a
common understanding that the OSCE has a well-stocked
toolbox to prevent conflict and build confidence, which, for
political reasons, is not always fully used.
Dialogue came first in 2019, not only at the highest political
level but also in the OSCE’s daily work. The Slovak
Chair invited special guests to participate in the weekly
Permanent Council in Vienna and thus to contribute to
the priorities for 2019: the President of the International
Committee of the Red Cross, Peter Maurer, spoke about
his organization’s work for people affected by conflicts,
while the Secretary General of the Council of Europe,
Marija Pejčinović Burić, stressed the importance of closer
multilateral ties. Other events benefited from esteemed
guest speakers as well, from Heinz Fischer, Co-Chair of
the Ban Ki-Moon Centre and a former President of Austria,
and Rt. Hon. Baroness Catherine Ashton, former European
Union High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security
Policy, at the Annual Security Review Conference, to Mary
Robinson, former President of Ireland and former United
Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, former UN
Special Envoy on Climate Change and founder of the Mary
Robinson Foundation – Climate Justice, at a discussion on
the role of women in addressing environmental and security
challenges.

operations in the first six months of 2019, the Slovak Chair
made it an objective to strengthen the links between Vienna
and the field and to put a spotlight on the important work
done by OSCE staff on a daily basis – whether in conflict or
settlement settings or by implementing projects across all
three dimensions from supporting national reform efforts to
strengthen good governance and democratic institutions,
to providing training, empowering women or promoting
regional co-operation in Central Asia, as well as Eastern and
South-Eastern Europe.

Gathering in High Tatras, Slovakia, 9 July 2019. (MFA Slovakia)

Complementing the Organization’s agenda and its priorities,
the Chair organized events on a wide range of topics
spanning the OSCE’s work, with the aim of improving
exchanges of best practices and lessons learned and
fostering future co-operation. These events ranged from
high-level conferences on issues such as anti-Semitism,
counterterrorism, cybersecurity and SSG/R to a Youth
Forum and smaller events on the role of women and climate
change or freedom of peaceful assembly.
In all its efforts, the Slovak Chairmanship aimed to increase
the participation of civil society, women, youth, multilateral
representatives, academia and other relevant actors and
stakeholders in order to benefit from a vast spectrum of
expertise and experience.
STRENGTHENING STABILITY IN THE REGION
AND THE ORGANIZATION
With a comprehensive understanding of strengthening
stability, the Slovak Chair focused just as much on
supporting the resolution, mediation and prevention of
conflict in the OSCE region as on the working methods and
procedures employed in the Organization itself.
This meant that the Chairperson-in-Office showed that
the OSCE is engaged in, and supportive of, the work done
in the region at the highest level. By visiting all 15 field

In its efforts to strengthen stability, the Chairmanship
supported the OSCE Secretariat, as well as the High
Commissioner on National Minorities (HCNM), the Office for
Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) and the
Representative on Freedom of the Media (RFOM) in their
work to assist the participating States in upholding their
commitments.
At the same time, the Slovak Chair paid close attention to
one of the OSCE’s core areas of expertise, the monitoring
of elections, and helped to secure additional means
to respond to the high number of unexpected election
monitoring requests in 2019.
Stability includes a solid basis for the work of the
Organization. By appointing Slovak State Secretary and
Special Representative for the Chairmanship Lukáš Parízek
as Chair of the Informal Working Group on scales of
contribution, the Slovak Chair managed to put firm financing
and organizational building blocks in place.
Similarly, Slovakia not only fulfilled its commitment to
organize almost all mandated events, such as the Economic
and Environmental Forum in Prague and the Human
Dimension Implementation Meeting in Warsaw, but it also
pushed back against negative institutional precedents and
organized the latter with all necessary decisions in place
and with the participation of a wide range of stakeholders.
More than 1,500 representatives from governments and civil
society attended the two-week conference in September
2019 – a record level of participation.

26TH MINISTERIAL COUNCIL
5–6 DECEMBER 2019, BRATISLAVA
The 2019 Ministerial Council in Bratislava – the OSCE’s
biggest and most important annual gathering – brought
together almost 50 decision makers and more than 1,500
delegates from across the OSCE region and beyond. It
was the biggest international conference Bratislava has
ever hosted and marked another peak in the Slovak Chair’s
efforts to strengthen the OSCE in a shifting global and
regional security environment.
Reflecting on the current state of multilateral co-operation
and urging OSCE foreign ministers to recommit to
the values at the core of the Helsinki Final Act, OSCE
Chairperson-in-Office Lajčák issued his Bratislava Appeal,
which was joined by more than 40 OSCE ministers.
During the two-day event, discussions were led in both
the plenary hall and in more informal settings, such as a
ministers-only dinner on the eve of the Ministerial Council, a
working lunch and a dinner at Bratislava Castle, as well as

during various side events and meetings with the Partners
for Co-operation. Topics discussed ranged from reviving
and strengthening a culture of interactive dialogue in OSCE
formats to promoting the OSCE’s role in the multilateral
landscape and better equipping the Organization to
address emerging global challenges in all three security
dimensions. Discussions also addressed efforts to settle
existing conflicts in the OSCE region and mitigate the
humanitarian impacts on the civilian population in conflictaffected areas (a special focus was placed on the crisis
in and around Ukraine and the SMM’s fifth anniversary),
empowering young people, improving capacity-building
in protecting critical energy infrastructure through a virtual
training centre and strengthening the role of women in
peace negotiations.
While foreign ministers adopted six decisions and
declarations in Bratislava, the most important outcome was

“The OSCE is a platform for dialogue among diverse
states; its consensus decisions are a result of extensive
and inclusive consultations. Yet, it can only be effective if
- while fully respecting our principles and commitments –
it is based on a shared pursuit of compromise.
A failure to reach consensus is a failure of us all, who are
accountable to our citizens and responsible to each other
for the full implementation of the OSCE norms, principles
and commitments. I therefore call for increased flexibility
and willingness to compromise in order to broaden and
strengthen our interactive dialogue; to put the hopes,
expectations and well-being of our people before our
own political objectives; to focus on finding what unites
us rather than divides us; and to harness the OSCE as
the unique forum for open dialogue and joint action it was
created to be.”

thus ensuring important stability and strategic continuity
in the Organization’s work. The Slovak Chair expressed its
gratitude to Sweden for taking over the Chairmanship in
2021 and Poland in 2022.
As an outcome of the Ministerial Council, participating
States reaffirmed their commitments to the Code of
Conduct on Politico-Military Aspects of Security through a

from certain areas of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions.
The TCG, with its four working groups, is the only forum
where its participants meet on a regular basis to discuss
issues of essential importance to the civilian population,
as well as the implementation of the Minsk agreements.
The TCG’s agenda covers a wide spectrum of topics
in the political, security, economic and humanitarian
spheres. Effective co-ordination with the SMM is ensured
by the SMM Chief Monitor, who acts as the co-ordinator
of the TCG Working Group on Security Issues.
In 2019, the TCG’s efforts helped to contain violence on
the contact line and to noticeably decrease the number
of civilian casualties. Broad success was achieved on
the disengagement of forces and hardware in three
pilot zones near the villages of Stanytsia Luhanska

and Zolote in the Luhansk region and Petrivske in the
Donetsk region. Together with the sides’ approval of the
sequencing of the local elections and of the application
of the special status foreseen by the Minsk agreements,
this paved the way for a summit of the Normandy format.
Meeting in Paris on 9 December 2019, the Normandy
leaders agreed on concrete deliverables, thus providing
guidance to the TCG work for the months to come. In
this vein, an exchange of detainees took place on 29
December 2019.
The TCG also facilitated talks to repair the pedestrian
section of the bridge near Stanytsia Luhanska, where
the only operating crossing point in the Luhansk region
is located. This was a major improvement for the local
population. With the same objective and thanks to
the SMM’s support on the ground, the TCG devoted
constant attention to enabling the continued supply of
water, electricity, gas and telecommunications across the
contact line, in particular by making possible essential
repairs and the operation of critical infrastructure in
conflict-affected areas.

“One of the values we need to incorporate in our planning
is respect for both the environment and the people who
live in it. Sound environmental planning will enable the
HLPG to deliver on these values.”

THE HIGH-LEVEL PLANNING GROUP
https://www.osce.org/chairmanship/high-level-planning-group

Throughout 2019, the sides reported comparatively low
levels of ceasefire violations, leading to a period of relative
stability and calm on the front lines. The Office is the only
OSCE field presence in the South Caucasus and the only
international presence with access to the front lines.
The Personal Representative, Ambassador Andrzej
Kasprzyk, and his team conducted monitoring exercises,
provided a continuous review of the situation on the ground,
supported the Chairperson-in-Office and the Minsk Group
Co-Chairs and continued to look for opportunities to
promote further confidence-building measures with the
consent of the sides.
The Office conducted monitoring exercises 18 times on the
line of contact and five times on the Armenian–Azerbaijani
border. These monitoring activities and the logistical
support provided by the Office enabled representatives of
the High-Level Planning Group to visit the region in April and
June and facilitated the Co-Chairs’ visits to the region in
February, May and October. The Office also supported visits
by the Chairperson-in-Office to the region in March. At the
request of the sides, the Office was involved in supporting a
humanitarian operation to recover the body of a serviceman
from between front-line positions in September.
In addition, the Office provided reports and briefings
to the Chairperson-in-Office, the OSCE Chairmanship
and the Co-Chairs on an ongoing basis. The Personal
Representative also briefed and co-operated closely with
key interlocutors like the International Committee of the Red
Cross (ICRC) and the United Nations High Commissioner
for Refugees (UNHCR). Together with the Co-Chairs,
he briefed and exchanged views with the UN High
Commissioner for Refugees and the President of the ICRC
in Geneva in September. He accompanied the Co-Chairs to
consultations with senior officials from the foreign ministries
of France, Sweden and the United States of America. He
assisted the Co-Chairs in organizing meetings at the level of
foreign ministers in January, April, June and September and
was actively engaged in the preparations for the Summit
meeting between the President of Azerbaijan and the Prime
Minister of Armenia in Vienna in March.

CHAIRMANSHIP

In accordance with the decisions of the 1994 Budapest
Summit on intensification of CSCE action in relation to
the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, the High-Level Planning
Group (HLPG) was established to make recommendations
to the OSCE Chairperson-in-Office regarding a possible
multinational OSCE peacekeeping force. In keeping with this
mandate, the HLPG engaged in ongoing discussions with a
range of like-minded organizations, actors and other entities
in 2019 in order to update its planning options for a possible
peacekeeping mission. Arising from this engagement and
in co-operation with a range of organizations and subjectmatter experts, a programme to scope and integrate
environmental protection and risk management into the
HLPG planning was initiated, with a view to minimizing
the forces’ environmental footprint. Close liaison was
maintained with OSCE executive structures, and focused
briefings were provided to OSCE delegations. The HLPG
continued to integrate a gender perspective into its planning
process. As part of its engagement with other organizations
and institutions, and with the aim of capturing valuable
lessons, the HLPG engaged with the European Association
of Peace Operations Training Centres and a range of
training institutions in Slovakia. It also continued its close
co-operation with the UN Global Services Centre Brindisi
and other UN entities. Previous contact was maintained
with the Multinational Peace Force Southeast Europe in
Tyrnavos and EU military staff in Brussels.

TRANSDNIESTRIAN CONFLICT
FRANCO FRATTINI

AMBASSADOR
RUDOLF MICHALKA

Special Representative
of the OSCE
Chairperson-in-Office
for the Transdniestrian
settlement process

Special Representative
of the OSCE
Chairperson-in-Office
for the South Caucasus

While the overall situation related to the aftermath of the
August 2008 war in Georgia remained free of military
hostilities, developments along the administrative boundary
lines threatened stability. The OSCE Special Representative
of the Chairperson-in-Office for the South Caucasus,
Ambassador Rudolf Michalka, and his fellow Co-Chairs
from the European Union and the United Nations facilitated
four rounds of the Geneva International Discussions (GID).
Discussions of a potential joint declaration on the non-use
of force and related measures continued, supported by
an OSCE-sponsored info session on the topic prior to the
50th round in Geneva. The GID and its associated Incident
Prevention and Response Mechanisms (IPRM) proved once
again to be the only platforms for de-escalating tensions
and addressing concrete issues on the ground. The Ergneti
IPRM and related technical meetings in particular proved
essential to temporarily defusing tensions after an increase
in the presence of armed security forces in the Chorchana/
Tsnelisi forest in late summer. However, a regular meeting
of the IPRM in Ergneti has not taken place since 29
August 2019 and the Gali IPRM remains deadlocked.
The Co-Chairs continued to call for an immediate
resumption of both IPRMs in their regular formats without
preconditions. The Chairmanship also supported further
confidence-building measures related to missing persons;
environmental threats; youth; and women, peace and
security.

In 2019, the Slovak Chairmanship worked in close cooperation with the OSCE Mission to Moldova to promote full
implementation of the Berlin Plus “package of eight” and to
facilitate discussions between the Sides. During meetings
in Chisinau, Bratislava and Tiraspol, Special Representative
Frattini stressed the importance for the Sides to apply an
output-oriented approach. The chief negotiators met three
times in the 1+1 format, while the working groups convened
on 19 occasions throughout the year. On 9-10 October, a
conference in the 5+2 format was organized in Bratislava.
One of the main achievements of 2019 was the Sides’
decision to implement a pilot project eliminating the need
for prior notification in case of official representatives’
personal visits to either territory. The support of the Special
Representative on the matter was decisive and made it
possible to reach this decision.
During the Ministerial Council in Bratislava on 5-6 December,
the accomplishments and the progress achieved during
the year were presented in a Ministerial Statement on the
negotiations on the Transdniestrian Settlement Process in
the 5+2 format, which was adopted by the 57 participating
States at the 26th OSCE Ministerial Council.

Special Representative
of the OSCE

on Gender

Professor Severino, in her capacity as OSCE Special
Representative of the Slovak OSCE Chairmanship,
continued her work to enhance the visibility of the OSCE in
the international fight against corruption.
In her endeavours in 2019, Professor Severino actively
promoted OSCE principles and commitments by calling
on and encouraging governments and international
organizations to intensify their anti-corruption efforts. In
2019, Special Representative Severino visited a number
of OSCE countries, including Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and
Slovakia, where she met with members of Government,
senior officials and representatives of civil society.
In February, Professor Severino also had the opportunity to
address the 18th Winter Meeting of the OSCE Parliamentary
Assembly.
Her commitment to creating conditions conducive to
inclusive and co-operative responses to corruption has
led to greater awareness within the OSCE region of
crucial issues related to the ownership of anti-corruption
governance; the awareness of, and support from, civil
society; the engagement of, and association with, the
private sector; prevention and incentives; and the role of
digitalization.

Safety of Women. She also advanced the discussion on
women’s participation in the economic and environmental
dimension through an event on the role of women in security
and environmental threats that featured former Irish President
Mary Robinson. Throughout the year, Ambassador Verveer
promoted the full implementation of UN Security Council
Resolution 1325 in the OSCE region in line with the Slovak
Chairmanship’s focus on conflict prevention and resolution,
and she engaged with participating States and the
Secretariat in Vienna.

THREE PERSONAL REPRESENTATIVES OF
THE OSCE CHAIRPERSON-IN-OFFICE ON
TOLERANCE AND NON-DISCRIMINATION

RABBİ ANDREW BAKER

AMBASSADOR MEHMET PAÇACI

PROFESSOR INGEBORG GABRIEL

Personal Representative of the
OSCE Chairperson-in-Office on
Combating Anti-Semitism

Personal Representative of the
OSCE Chairperson-in-Office
on Combating Intolerance and
Discrimination against Muslims

Personal Representative of the
OSCE Chairperson-in-Office on
Combating Racism, Xenophobia
and Discrimination, also focusing
on Intolerance and Discrimination
against Christians and Members of
Other Religions

The Personal Representative of the OSCE Chairperson-inOffice on Combating Anti-Semitism, Rabbi Andrew Baker,
worked closely with the Slovak Chairmanship to organize
a high-level conference on combating anti-Semitism that
was held in Bratislava on 5–6 February 2019. The event
was also attended by Special Representatives Paçacı and
Gabriel. In June, Rabbi Baker conducted a country visit to
Dublin and in November to Copenhagen. In October, he
visited Sofia to review the work of Bulgaria’s National Coordinator on Combating Anti-Semitism. Through his visits
and in presentations to OSCE conferences, Rabbi Baker
stressed the importance for participating States to address
the critical security needs of Jewish communities and to
develop targeted educational programmes that make it
possible to counteract negative attitudes towards Jews.
He also referenced the pragmatic value of state institutions
employing the International Holocaust Remembrance
Alliance’s working definition of anti-Semitism in their dayto-day work and highlighted the growing number of
governments and international organizations that have
adopted it.
The Personal Representative of the OSCE Chairperson-inOffice on Combating Intolerance and Discrimination against
Muslims, Professor Mehmet Paçacı, held discussions
with civil society members, local authorities, government
representatives and diplomatic delegations from many
countries throughout 2019. An undeniable increase in antiMuslim intolerance and discrimination cases throughout the
world, including the OSCE region, was a common concern
in all these meetings. He also drew attention to the fact that,
in a global world, groups that are intolerant and discriminate
against Muslims are actively interacting through traditional
and social media, nurturing their destructive ideology, and
that they are increasingly resorting to violence. He also

16

called attention to legislative regulations that jeopardize
the implementation of the fundamental human right to
freedom of religion or belief as one of the constructive
principles of the modern world. In his contacts, Personal
Representative Paçacı persistently encouraged civil society
and government representatives to recognize, define and
report anti-Muslim hate crimes, as these steps constitute
a crucial stage in combating discrimination and intolerance
against all members of religions.
Professor Ingeborg Gabriel, the Personal Representative
of the OSCE Chairperson-in-Office on Combating
Racism, Xenophobia and Discrimination, also Focusing
on Intolerance and Discrimination against Christians and
Members of Other Religions, was a panellist and keynote
speaker at a number of OSCE events. In her speeches,
she stressed the need for networking and for co-ordinated
activities in the field of religious education, dialogue and
the inclusion of members of religious communities in
activities related to tolerance and non-discrimination and
peacemaking. Professor Gabriel also took part in an event
to mark the 25th anniversary of the European Commission
against Racism and Intolerance of the Council of Europe
held in Paris on 26–27 September 2019. She gave many
individual talks on issues concerning her mandate, which
showed the importance of an exchange of ideas in this
sensitive area.
The Personal Representatives jointly took part in the Human
Dimension Implementation Meeting in Warsaw on 25
September 2019. They also attended the Mediterranean
Conference held in Tirana on 23–24 October 2019, which
they combined with a country visit to Albania to hold talks
with government officials, civil society representatives and
religious communities.

ASSISTANCE WITH BILATERAL
AGREEMENTS

YOUTH AND SECURITY

DR. VOLKER
FROBARTH
OSCE Representative
to the Russian-Latvian
Joint Commission on
Military Pensioners
The Representative continued to assist in the
implementation of the 1994 bilateral agreement between
the governments of Latvia and the Russian Federation on
social guarantees for military pensioners from the Russian
Federation and their families residing in Latvia. Some 6,520
people currently fall under the special provisions of the
agreement. No individual complaints by military pensioners
were submitted in 2019, continuing the trend of previous
years. The nature of issues considered by the Commission
has shifted from individual cases to matters concerning
the framework for providing services according to the
specifications of the bilateral agreement. The 2019 report to
the Permanent Council concluded that the function of the
Representative should continue as a standby arrangement.

LEGAL FRAMEWORK
AMBASSDOR HELMUT TICHY
SPECIAL ADVISER to the Slovak Chairmanship
on Strengthening the Legal Framework of the
OSCE and Chairperson of the Informal Working
Group on Strengthening the Legal Framework of
the OSCE
Ambassador Helmut Tichy chaired three meetings in
2019 of the Informal Working Group on Strengthening
the Legal Framework of the OSCE. The discussions in
the Informal Working Group again focused on finding a
solution that would grant international legal personality to
the OSCE, in accordance with one of four options that had
emerged during the discussions in the previous years. The
Secretariat also provided delegations with valuable updates
on the operational consequences of the lack of a clear legal
status for the OSCE, and the March and October meetings
allowed for intensified discussions between delegations and
experts who provided input on the legal issues at hand from
an academic point of view. The participating States also
continued to explore ways to enhance the OSCE’s legal
status through domestic legislation and/or through bilateral
agreements with the OSCE, as well as by concluding an
agreement on the legal status, privileges and immunities of
the OSCE between interested participating States outside
the OSCE framework.

CHAIRMANSHIP

ALBA BROJKA AND SAMUEL GODA
Special Representatives of the
Chairperson-in-Office on Youth and Security
The Special Representatives on Youth and Security
dedicated their efforts to advancing the targeted and
meaningful implementation of youth and security-related
commitments, in particular last year’s Ministerial Council
Declaration on the Role of Youth in Contributing to Peace
and Security Efforts and United Nations Security Council
Resolutions 2419 and 2250. The Special Representatives
strengthened the voices of young women and men
within the OSCE region and beyond by highlighting the
role of youth in peace and security efforts, integrating
youth perspectives and promoting active and meaningful
participation on the part of young people across the OSCE
institutional setting and its three dimensions of security.
Their work was driven by a vision to incorporate the
perspectives and expertise of young leaders more
systematically. This resulted in the launching of the
#perspectives2030 initiative in co-operation with the Office
of the Secretary General and the Friedrich Ebert Stiftung’s
Regional Office for Peace and Cooperation in Europe.
The initiative culminated in the OSCE-wide Youth Forum in
Bratislava that took place on 28–29 October. The Special
Representatives on Youth and Security took part in over 50
OSCE and external initiatives, field visits and consultation
meetings across the OSCE area, and engaged with
participating States, OSCE staff, international organizations,
academia, civil society practitioners and, above all, youth.
Throughout the year, they paid particular attention to
co-ordination and co-operation among different youth
stakeholders, especially work with youth in the field. In this
spirit, they fully supported the Chairmanship’s OSCE-wide
Expert Workshop on Youth, Peace and Security in Sando,
Sweden, co-organized by the Folke Bernadotte Academy.
The Special Representatives represented the voice
of youth within the OSCE and also paved the way
for other young experts to engage on topics such as
human rights, tolerance and non-discrimination, good
governance, preventing and countering violent extremism
and radicalization that lead to terrorism, youth economic
participation and entrepreneurship, climate change, cyber/
ICT security and digitalization.

PARTNERS FOR CO-OPERATION
The OSCE maintains special relations with five Asian and six Mediterranean Partners for Co-operation to address shared
security challenges. In 2019, the OSCE Slovak Chairmanship continued to promote ongoing dialogue and joint activities
with the Partners for Co-operation with support from the outgoing Italian and in-coming Albanian OSCE Chairmanships.

During its Chairmanship of the Asian Partners for Cooperation Group in 2019, Italy focused on further promoting
and strengthening an open and interactive dialogue
between the participating States and the Asian Partners
for Co-operation. In elaborating the agenda of the Asian
Contact Group, Italy worked with the Slovak OSCE
Chairmanship and the Asian Partners to ensure that the
agenda corresponded to the interests and concerns of the
Asian Partner countries and supported the priorities of the
OSCE Chairmanship.
In 2019, five meetings of the Asian Partners for Cooperation Group were held in Vienna, which allowed the
OSCE participating States and Asian Partners to engage
in timely and insightful discussions on key security issues
of interest to all parties and to share best practices and
experiences with each other based on the Ministerial
Council decisions adopted in Milan in 2018. Each meeting
featured speakers from one of the Asian Partner countries,
as well as presentations on selected topics by experts
from international organizations, diplomats, academia and
civil society. They included discussions on the topics of
the OSCE’s commitment to women, peace and security;
advancing partnership for sustainable security; countering
trafficking in human beings and modern slavery; the current
situation and ways forward on the Korean Peninsula; and
democratic institutions and the safety of journalists in
Afghanistan.

2019 OSCE ASIAN CONFERENCE
The 2019 OSCE Asian Conference, “How to Achieve
Comprehensive Security in the Digital Era: The Perspectives
of the OSCE and Its Asian Partners”, was held in Tokyo on
2–3 September. More than 130 political representatives,
policy experts, and practitioners from international, regional
and subregional organizations, academia, business and civil
society from across the OSCE’s participating States and
Asian Partners for Co-operation gathered to explore ways
to tackle common security challenges arising from the use
of digital technology in the three dimensions of security.
During the high-level opening session, many speakers
reconfirmed that strengthening co-operation between
OSCE participating States and its Asian Partners for Cooperation was key to achieving comprehensive security in
the digital era. The opening was followed by three thematic
sessions, which covered all three security dimensions and
specific topical areas of comprehensive security in the
digital age, namely tackling ICT security risks; the digital
economy as a driver for promoting co-operation, security
and growth; and risks to the safety of journalists. The
conference also featured a side event called “Enhancing
security, building partnerships: Co-operation between
OSCE field operations in Central Asia and Afghanistan on
border management”, which showcased how, since 2009,
the OSCE has supported the professionalization of border
guards and mid- and senior-level border and custom
officials in Afghanistan, mainly through extrabudgetary
contributions.

Chairmanship: Albania

During its Chairmanship of the OSCE Mediterranean
Partners for Co-operation Group in 2019, Albania fostered
an inclusive political dialogue that followed a demand-driven
approach and responded to the interests and priorities
of the Mediterranean Partners. The celebration in 2019 of
the 25th anniversary of the Mediterranean Contact Group
allowed for brainstorming throughout the year about the
future of the Partnership and the available Partnership tools.
In co-ordination with the 2019 Slovak OSCE Chairmanship
and in line with the efforts of previous Chairmanships of the
Mediterranean Contact Group, Albania strived to take the
Partnership to the next level by building on the progress
made in previous years.
Six meetings of the Mediterranean Partners for Cooperation Group were held in Vienna during the course of
the year, which provided a valuable platform for information
exchange, dialogue and sharing of best practices between
the OSCE participating States and the Mediterranean
Partners for Co-operation. The subjects of the six meetings
were jointly selected with the Mediterranean Partners in
order to reflect the wide range of topics of interest to the
individual Mediterranean Part-ner countries and to support
the priorities of the 2019 Slovak OSCE Chairmanship.
Apart from the Contact Group meetings, a special
ambassadorial retreat took place in Valletta on 7–8 June, with
the aim of taking stock of the Partnership on its 25th anniversary.
The retreat was followed by the OSCE Mediterranean
Conference, which was held in Tirana on 24–25 October.

2019 OSCE MEDITERRANEAN
CONFERENCE
The 2019 OSCE Mediterranean Conference organized
by the Albanian Chairmanship of the Mediterranean
Contact Group was entitled “The 25th anniversary
of the Mediterranean Contact Group: achievements,
challenges and future opportunities for the Partnership”.
It commemorated the anniversary of the Partnership and
focused on the next 25 years by fostering a conversation
among participating States and Mediterranean Partners for
Co-operation on what has been achieved, and what can
be improved in the OSCE’s approach to Mediterranean cooperation.

CHAIRMANSHIP

The conference was attended by a plurality of foreign
ministers and deputy foreign ministers and more than 250
high-level representatives of the Mediterranean Partners for
Co-operation, OSCE participating States, OSCE executive
structures, international organizations, civil society,
academia and the media. It considered ways to deepen
Mediterranean co-operation and further common security
in the Mediterranean region. It consisted of a high-level
political session focusing on what has been achieved and
what was still missing in the relationship between the OSCE
participating States and the Mediterranean Partners for
Co-operation. The political segment was followed by three
working sessions covering all three security dimensions
dedicated to countering terrorism, youth participation and
engagement, and economic connectivity.

FROM CONTACT GROUPS TO PARTNERS
FOR CO-OPERATION GROUPS
In order to better reflect the Partnership’s realities and
tools, the 2019 OSCE Ministerial Council renamed
the two Contact Groups with the Mediterranean
and Asian Partners for Co-operation into the OSCE
Mediterranean Partners for Co-operation Group and
the OSCE Asian Partners for Co-operation Group.
Established in 1994 and 2003, respectively, the
Contact Groups provided regular venues for dialogue and a framework for co-operation between
the OSCE participating States and the Partners
for Co-operation. By renaming the Contact
Groups as Partners for Co-operation Groups, the
participating States stressed their commitment to
strengthening political dialogue and practical cooperation with the Partners for Co-operation.
“We reaffirm our commitment to the relationship
and dialogue with our Mediterranean and Asian
Partners for Co-operation to address common
security challenges and threats. The security of
the OSCE area is inextricably linked to that of the
Mediterranean. Building on our interdependence,
we are ready to develop this process further.”

www.osce.org/permanent-council

During the 2019 Slovak OSCE Chairmanship, the weekly
meetings of the Permanent Council were chaired by
Slovakia’s Permanent Representative to the OSCE,
Ambassador Radomír Boháč.
Throughout the year, Ambassador Boháč welcomed
distinguished guest speakers to the Permanent Council,
including foreign ministers and deputy ministers from the
participating States and high-level representatives from
international organizations. Guest speakers highlighted
issues of special relevance to the Chairmanship, such
as the humanitarian situation in conflict-affected areas of
eastern Ukraine, inclusive dialogue, effective multilateralism
and a safer future.
Besides the work of the OSCE institutions and field
operations, in view of unresolved conflict and crisis situations
in the OSCE area, various conflict settlement efforts played an
important part in many of the 43 sessions of the Permanent
Council in 2019, as well as four joint sessions with the Forum

FORUM FOR
SECURITY
CO-OPERATION
The Forum for Security Co-operation (FSC) is the OSCE’s
key decision-making body on politico-military aspects of
security. Its participants meet weekly in Vienna to discuss
issues such as arms control and confidence- and securitybuilding measures. The Forum Chairmanship rotates among
the OSCE participating States, with each state chairing
the FSC for four months. In 2019, the FSC was chaired by
Switzerland, Tajikistan and the Czech Republic.

Security
Co-operation

www.osce.org/forum-for-security-cooperation

The strategic discussions that took place during Security Dialogues in 2019 indicated the
FSC’s importance as a platform for dialogue by addressing security issues of common
interest and concern. Even though the situation in and around Ukraine remained the
dominant topic in the FSC, discussions also took place on matters related to subregional
military and defence co-operation; normative and project-related aspects in the field of
small arms and light weapons (SALW) and stockpiles of conventional ammunition (SCA);
implementation of the women, peace and security agenda; the OSCE Code of Conduct
on Politico-Military Aspects of Security and the implementation of United Nations
Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 1540; the Vienna Document 2011 and confidenceand security-building measures (CSBMs); private military and security companies; and
aspects of modern warfare. The three 2019 FSC Chairmanships stimulated discussions by
organizing a total of 21 Security Dialogues. Several initiatives undertaken by participating
States led to the adoption of five decisions, all designed to support the implementation
of existing commitments. Two commemorative declarations related to FSC topics were
adopted at the 26th Ministerial Council: a Commemorative Declaration on the Occasion of
the 25th Anniversary of the OSCE Code of Conduct on Politico-Military Aspects of Security
(a joint proposal of the Czech FSC Chairmanship and the Slovak OSCE Chairmanship)
and a Commemorative Declaration on the Occasion of the 25th Anniversary of the OSCE
Principles Governing Non-Proliferation and 15th Anniversary of UNSCR 1540.

With a view to promoting regional stability and
comprehensive and co-operative security, the three 2019
FSC Chairmanships dedicated a total of five Security
Dialogues to subregional military defence co-operation,
which, in geographical terms, spanned the Višegrad Group,
regional organizations in Central Asia and the Collective
Security Treaty Organization (CSTO). In particular, under the
FSC Chairmanship of Switzerland, the Security Dialogues
focused on regional co-operation aimed at promoting a

“transparency and confidence” approach. Tajikistan’s FSC
Chairmanship oversaw discussions on politico-military
aspects of border management and the challenges and
opportunities related to a regional approach in Central Asia,
the role of CSBMs in Central Asia and synergies between
regional organizations and the OSCE. A Security Dialogue
on politico-military co-operation among the Višegrad Group
countries was organized by the FSC Chairmanship of the
Czech Republic.

-----------------------Page 27 End-----------------------

In accordance with the task stemming from OSCE
documents and various FSC and Ministerial Council
decisions on small arms and light weapons and stockpiles
of conventional ammunition, all three FSC Chairmanships
conducted a range of related activities. Given the impressive
implementation results of many project activities, the topic
of SALW and SCA remained one of the most enduring
and promising items on the FSC agenda, with five Security
Dialogues and many informal meetings dedicated to the
subject during the year. The OSCE’s efforts focused in
particular on reviewing and updating the OSCE Best
Practice Guides on SALW and on conventional ammunition,
with a clear roadmap for this process being agreed before
the end of 2019. Regrettably, the OSCE meeting to review
the implementation of the OSCE assistance projects in the
field of SALW and SCA – a firm commitment by all OSCE
participating States, as decided at the 2017 Ministerial
Council – was not implemented in 2019 on account of a
lack of consensus on the agenda.
Two other topics highlighted during the year were the nonproliferation of weapons of mass destruction and UNSCR
1540 – on its 15th anniversary – which one Security
Dialogue was devoted to under the FSC Chairmanship of
Tajikistan and another under the FSC Chairmanship of the
Czech Republic.
All three FSC Chairmanships co-operated closely with
the Slovak OSCE Chairmanship-in-Office and the OSCE
Permanent Council on cross-dimensional issues of
relevance to both bodies in line with the OSCE’s concept
of comprehensive and indivisible security. To this end,
four joint meetings of the Forum for Security Co-operation
and the Permanent Council were held: two on structured
dialogue, one on SSG/R and one on lessons learned in the
field of conflict resolution.
The 29th Annual Implementation Assessment Meeting
(AIAM) took place in March 2019 during Switzerland’s

FSC Chairmanship. Led by Lithuania and Liechtenstein,
the AIAM provided an opportunity to discuss various
issues related to the present and future implementation
of agreed CSBMs. The discussions resulted in a number
of suggestions about how the current CSBMs could be
implemented more effectively and improved in the future.
Furthermore, in May 2019 the FSC Chair’s Co-ordinator on
the Vienna Document organized an Expert-Level Workshop
on the Exchange of Major Weapon and Equipment Systems
Data. Additionally, in an effort to ensure that the Vienna
Document remains up to date with respect to the current
politico-military realities and technological developments, a
Vienna Document Plus proposal, building on suggestions
made earlier, was put forward by a group of 32 participating
States, indicating that many participating States recognize
the need to update the Vienna Document and the
importance of continuing efforts in Working Group A in this
regard.
The eighth Annual Discussion on the Implementation
of the Code of Conduct on Politico-Military Aspects
of Security was held in June 2019 under the Tajik FSC
Chairmanship. The meeting provided a valuable opportunity
for participating States to review the enforcement of the
Code and to exchange views on ways to further improve its
implementation.
The FSC also contributed to the 2019 Annual Security
Review Conference, providing inputs to relevant sessions
and focusing on politico-military elements, including
conventional arms control and CSBMs.
The year 2019 saw three Security Dialogues devoted to the
following aspects of gender equality: integrating gender
perspectives in the politico-military dimension; the role of
the military in implementing UNSCR 1325; and enhancing
the role of women in both conflictrelated and peacetime
operations, paving the way to the 20th anniversary of
UNSCR 1325, which will be commemorated in 2020.

Active across the OSCE area, the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly (PA) continued to
promote parliamentary engagement on issues high on the international agenda in 2019. The
PA deepened its relations with other OSCE institutions and developed its partnerships with
outside organizations. Georgian parliamentarian George Tsereteli was re-elected President
of the Assembly at the Annual Session in Luxembourg in July. Secretary General Roberto
Montella was re-elected by the Standing Committee in Luxembourg for a second five-year
term starting 1 January 2021.
PARLIAMENTARY DIPLOMACY
President Tsereteli and Secretary General Montella
visited more than 20 countries throughout the OSCE
area, conducting timely bilateral diplomacy on matters
of international concern. They met in Belgrade with the
Speaker of the Grand National Assembly of Turkey, Mustafa
Şentop, following Turkey’s military operation in northeastern Syria in October. Tsereteli, Montella and OSCE
Secretary General Thomas Greminger also received
Albanian President Ilir Meta on the sidelines of the spring
Bureau meeting in Copenhagen, which Meta addressed, in
preparation for the Albanian OSCE Chairmanship.
In May, Tsereteli, Montella and several members of the
OSCE PA visited Norway to learn about challenges
facing the Arctic region. In Svalbard, one of the world’s
northernmost inhabited areas, the OSCE parliamentarians
explored environmental and security risks posed by climate
change. Tsereteli, Montella and French parliamentarian
Pascal Allizard, an OSCE PA Vice-President and Special
Representative on Mediterranean Affairs, visited Egypt in
November to strengthen Mediterranean co-operation. The
PA held its 18th Autumn Meeting in Marrakech, Morocco,
the first time ever meeting in a Mediterranean Partner State.

The OSCE’s Conflict Prevention Centre (CPC) is the main point of contact
on all matters concerning OSCE field operations. It addresses all phases of
the conflict cycle by providing policy and operational guidance and advice,
including through early warning and support of the OSCE’s response in crisis
situations and through efforts to find lasting political settlements for existing
conflicts. The CPC is also a core structure of the OSCE’s work in the politicomilitary dimension and provides Organization-wide support for project
management.

CONTINUED FOCUS ON THE CRISIS IN AND
AROUND UKRAINE
The CPC continued its important role in the co-ordination
of the OSCE’s response to the crisis in and around
Ukraine, including by supporting efforts to stabilize the
security situation and foster implementation of the Minsk
agreements. It assisted the OSCE Special Monitoring
Mission to Ukraine (SMM) in reinforcing the Mission’s
dialogue facilitation efforts in conflict-affected areas;
consolidating the Mission’s procedures, policies and
reporting; and strengthening its technical monitoring
capabilities. The CPC continued to assist the TCG in its
mediation and conflict resolution efforts. 2019 saw progress
on the disengagement process in three pilot zones and the
reconstruction of the broken span of the bridge in Stanytsia
Luhanska. The CPC also supported the work of the OSCE
Project Co-ordinator in Ukraine and the Observer Mission at
the Russian Checkpoints Gukovo and Donetsk.
ACTIVITIES IN SUPPORT OF CONFLICT
RESOLUTION
The CPC supported the Transdniestrian settlement process
in Moldova by working closely with the OSCE Mission
to Moldova and the Special Representative of the OSCE
Chairperson-in-Office for the Transdniestrian Settlement
Process. It actively supported efforts by the Chairmanship
and the Mission to Moldova to reach an agreement on
outstanding points of the so-called “package of eight”, a list
of measures agreed upon by the Sides at the start of 2017.
The CPC continued to support the Mission to Moldova’s
efforts to secure the implementation of the “package of
eight”, leading to an improvement in the quality of life for
residents of both banks. Additionally, the CPC supported
a 5+2 meeting in Bratislava in October 2019, where
discussions were held on engaging in further confidencebuilding measures (CBMs) beyond the “package of eight”.
The CPC supported the work of the Special Representative
of the OSCE Chairperson-in-Office for the South Caucasus,
Ambassador Rudolf Michalka, during four rounds of the
GID, which address the consequences of the August
2008 war in Georgia, and at regular (until 29 August 2019)
and technical meetings of the IPRM in Ergneti. The CPC

provided mediation support and other expertise, together
with other Secretariat units to Special Representative
Michalka, with a view to contributing to initiatives in support
of the Chairmanship’s engagement in the context of the
GID and to improving the situation of conflict-affected
populations. The CPC co-moderated the GID working
group dealing with humanitarian issues and actively
contributed to developing a strategy on women, peace and
security for the GID Co-Chairs – representatives of the EU,
OSCE and UN. In further support of the GID, and to provide
opportunities for mutual understanding of conflict-affected
youth, the CPC organized a session of the OSCE summer
school in Vienna and Bratislava. The CPC continued to
engage in initiatives on other humanitarian issues, including
in relation to cases of missing persons.
The CPC supported the OSCE Minsk Group Co-Chairs, the
Personal Representative of the Chairperson-in-Office on the
Conflict Dealt with by the OSCE Minsk Conference, as well
as the High-Level Planning Group.
ACTIVITIES IN CENTRAL ASIA
The CPC facilitated liaison between Vienna and field
operations in Central Asia, including a visit by OSCE
Permanent Representatives to the region. The CPC
supported the work of the two regional flagship
projects, the OSCE Academy in Bishkek and the Border
Management Staff College in Dushanbe. In addition to
its regular activities, the CPC supported the Programme
Office in Dushanbe and the Chairmanship in presenting and
promoting the work of Women’s Resource Centres (WRCs)
in Tajikistan to donors and other participating States. WRCs
offer legal support, vocational courses and entrepreneurial
training to women in various areas of the country. As in
previous years, the CPC also hosted an OSCE Academy
student in the framework of the Academy internship
programme designed to provide students from Central Asia
with an opportunity to gain further professional experience.
ACTIVITIES IN SOUTH-EASTERN EUROPE
In addition to regular activities, the CPC continued to
support the Chairmanship, the Secretary General and
field operations in South-Eastern Europe in constructively

responding to political developments as they unfolded in
the region by providing tailored advice and by facilitating
OSCE responses. In addition, the CPC invested efforts in
enhancing synergy between OSCE structures, in particular
with OSCE institutions, through co-ordinated actions and
joint statements, hence amplifying their impact.
EARLY WARNING
The CPC continued to promote a structured and systematic
approach to early warning across the Organization,
specifically through the Network of Early Warning Focal
Points in OSCE field operations and other executive
structures. It organized the Network’s eighth annual
meeting, gathering 30 representatives for information
sharing and capacity building. Recognizing the essential
role of conflict analysis in early-warning reporting, the CPC
continued to facilitate conflict analysis workshops as a key
capacity-building tool, alongside regional meetings and
other events focused on the OSCE’s overall conflict cycle
toolbox.
MEDIATION SUPPORT
The CPC’s Mediation Support Team (MST) provided
mediation and dialogue facilitation support, for example,
by observing the negotiations within the Transdniestrian
settlement process and providing methodological feedback
to the mediators. Through debriefings, coaching and
handover retreats, the MST supported continuity between
the Chairperson-in-Office’s special representatives and
made that expertise available throughout their assignments.
SHARING INFORMATION AMONG
OSCE PARTICIPATING STATES
The CPC facilitates the exchange of military information
between and among participating States as stipulated in
the Vienna Document 2011. This sharing of information
is key to building confidence and trust within the OSCE
area. The OSCE Communications Network, established
by the 1990 Charter of Paris for a New Europe, provides
participating States with a reliable, timely and secure
channel for exchanging information.

33

-----------------------Page 35 End-----------------------

The MST facilitated strategy retreats for special
representatives for the Transdniestrian settlement process
and in the TCG, as well as workshops for field operations on
mediation process design. The MST deployed an external
expert to support negotiation formats, such as the GID
and the Incident Prevention and Response Mechanism in
Ergneti. Together with the OSCE Gender Section, the MST
developed the OSCE Toolkit on Inclusion of Women and
Effective Peace Processes.

2019 MODEL OSCE CONFERENCE IN GEORGIA
The CPC, as part of OSCE efforts to promote youth
participation in fostering peace and security, organized
the first Model OSCE Conference in Georgia from 18
to 22 November. The event helped build confidence
and links among young people from Georgia and other
participating States. A total of 23 students and young
professionals took part in a four-day simulation of the
OSCE Permanent Council. The event followed up on
the 2018 Ministerial Council Declaration on the Role
of Youth in Contributing to Peace and Security Efforts
and other related documents by seeking to enhance
relevant skills and experience of young people.

IMPLEMENTING POLITICO-MILITARY
COMMITMENTS
The FSC Support Section continued to support the
implementation of CSBMs, especially the Vienna Document,
by supporting subsequent FSC Chairs in organizing weekly
FSC meetings, preparing Security Dialogues, processing
the exchange of military information, preparing CSBM
implementation reports and providing assistance to the
OSCE participating States in this regard. The Section also
took several steps to improve the way the CPC processes
data and reports on exchanged military information by
developing a new Information Management and Reporting
System (iMARS).

The participants actively and enthusiastically engaged
in the exercise and provided positive feed-back. A
participant named Tamar (24) said after the conference:
“I really enjoyed all these days. [It was an] amazing
experience; it was so educational for me. I learned a lot
not only about the OSCE, but also about negotiation
skills and culture and history of your countries.”
The event was supported by the Slovak OSCE
Chairmanship and the delegations of Finland
and Italy. The CPC may expand activities of this
nature in 2020 depending on an assessment of
the event’s impact and lessons learned, as well as
interest on the part of other participating States.

The Section provided technical and administrative support
to the Informal Working Group on the Structured Dialogue
to foster a greater understanding of current and future
challenges to security in the OSCE area.
It supported work on the Code of Conduct on PoliticoMilitary Aspects of Security by examining ways in which it
can promote the implementation of norms for transparency
and co-operation among the armed forces of participating
States. The Annual Implementation Discussion on the Code
of Conduct was organized, as was a regional outreach
seminar in Larnaca, Cyprus, and a commemorative 25thanniversary symposium in Budapest.
The CPC managed nine extrabudgetary projects providing
assistance for project activities on SALW and SCA. A key

A security sector that is
accountable and inclusive
and respects human rights
is more effective in providing
security to a state and its
people. It also prevents the
outbreak and recurrence
of conflicts and supports
sustainable development.
The OSCE has a long track
record in supporting states in
reforming and strengthening
the governance of their security
sector. Its engagement in the
area of SSG/R reflects the
Organization’s comprehensive
approach to security. With
SSG/R being a priority of the
Slovak OSCE Chairmanship, the
CPC worked towards a more
coherent and co-ordinated
OSCE approach to SSG/R.

DURABLE HOUSING SOLUTIONS
The Regional Housing Programme (RHP) was
established to provide durable housing solutions
to vulnerable refugees and displaced persons
following the 1991–1995 conflicts on the territory of
former Yugoslavia. It is implemented by Bosnia and
Herzegovina, Croatia, Montenegro and Serbia and
mostly financed by the international donor community.

Students from the Central Asian Youth Network (CAYN) during a study tour to
the OSCE organized by the CPC and the Programme Offices in Bishkek and
Nur-Sultan. They met with the OSCE Chairmanship, the Secretary General and
other OSCE officials to learn about current and prospective OSCE work in their
respective countries and shared their views on how the CAYN model could be
replicated in other regions, Vienna, 3 October 2019. (OSCE)

reduce and prevent destabilizing excessive accumulation
and uncontrolled spread of SALW and conventional
ammunition.
Work also continued in 2019 to remove and dispose of
rocket fuel components in Armenia and Kyrgyzstan in order
to address threats to human security and the environment.
It is estimated that, by 2022, overall stockpiles of 180
tonnes of the rocket fuel components mélange and samin
in Kyrgyzstan and 160 tonnes of samin in Armenia will be
removed and disposed.

The OSCE, together with the UNHCR, continues
to support the fair, transparent and consistent
implementation of the RHP, focusing on beneficiary
selection to ensure that assistance is provided to the
most vulnerable refugees, as well as support to the
four partner countries in ensuring sustainability of
the solutions offered by housing projects. The RHP
has had an enormously positive effect on the lives of
ordinary people who previously lived in deplorable
housing conditions and who now have a place they
can call home. Not only has the RHP helped foster
greater regional co-operation between the four partner
countries, but it has also had a positive impact on
regional reconciliation in South-Eastern Europe.
As of the end of December 2019, almost 6,400 housing
units had been delivered to RHP beneficiaries, with
an additional 3,300 projected for 2020 and 800 for
2021. In 2019, the RHP was selected from 700 project
submissions from 115 countries to be showcased
at the second Paris Peace Forum in November.

The Section also assisted participating States in their
implementation of UN Security Council resolution 1540 on
the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.
PROGRAMME AND PROJECT MANAGEMENT
SUPPORT
In 2019, the CPC continued to facilitate a comprehensive
overview of project management portfolios and helped
all OSCE executive structures develop key performance
indicators. It continued to provide programme and project
management support to the Secretariat and field operations
and ensured quality control and the compliance of all
extrabudgetary project proposals with the OSCE Common
Regulatory Management System. In 2019, in consultations
with donors and focal points throughout the OSCE, the
CPC thoroughly updated all project-related templates.
Expert advice was provided on 108 project proposals
worth €79.3 million, including with respect to SMM activities
funded through voluntary and extrabudgetary contributions
amounting to €16.9 million. Furthermore, the CPC facilitated
eight training sessions at field operations on project cycle
management, programme and project planning, monitoring
and evaluation and extrabudgetary project handling, in
which 155 OSCE mission members (89 women; 66 men)
took part.

Throughout 2019, the Office of the Co-ordinator of OSCE Economic and Environmental
Activities (OCEEA) continued to support participating States in the implementation of their
commitments in the economic and environmental dimension with the aim of strengthening
security and stability, building confidence and preventing conflicts in the OSCE area.
The Office supported participating States in meeting objectives set by international
frameworks, including the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and assisted the
Slovak Chairmanship with its priorities on energy co-operation, new technologies, good
governance and connectivity in the digital era.
The 27th OSCE Economic and Environmental Forum
(EEF) focused on promoting economic progress and
security in the OSCE area through energy co-operation,
new technologies, good governance and connectivity in
the digital era. The EEF, which includes two preparatory
meetings and a concluding meeting, is the main annual
OSCE event in the economic and environmental dimension.
At the 2019 forum, participants engaged in constructive
discussions and shared best practices on the impact of the
digital transformation and new technologies on economies
and societies in the OSCE region.
In October 2019, the Economic and Environmental
Dimension Implementation Meeting reviewed the

THE OSCE E-LEARNING PLATFORM
E-learning, such as through massive open online
courses (MOOCs), addresses the growing need for
lifelong learning while reaching a wider audience
and adapting to a digitalized world. The OSCE now
offers several courses at https://elearning.osce.org/.
Anti-corruption training
The OCEEA developed free online training modules on
preventing and combating corruption for government
officials, representatives of law enforcement
agencies, the private sector, and civil society. The
curricula cover legal and non-legal tools, the latest
legislative and policy trends, and other relevant
measures and practices in anti-corruption efforts.
It aims at providing a base knowledge and raising
awareness of the range of international instruments available to national policymakers, anticorruption practitioners, and assisting them in developing/ implementing effective anti-corruption
measures designed to reduce possibilities for corruption, instability, and transnational crime.
Energy security training
Electricity blackouts caused by natural and man-made disasters are a serious security concern
across the OSCE area. Storms, floods and wildfires can destroy critical energy infrastructure;
human failure and fatal errors can exacerbate natural disasters, resulting in widespread
power outages with negative effects on people, the economy and the environment.
The OCEEA established the Virtual Competency and Training Centre for the Protection
of Critical Energy Networks to respond to this threat. The Centre offers online training
materials to build the capacities of energy-related decision makers on how to anticipate,
manage and mitigate risks to critical energy networks, with a focus on electricity grids.
The Centre makes use of the latest training methods for an interactive user experience
such as simulations in virtual reality/3D, augmented reality and gamification.

In the context of the project “Strengthening anti-corruption
reform in Armenia”, the OCEEA supported the development
of a National Anti-Corruption Strategy for 2019–2022
and an Action Plan, which the Cabinet of Ministers of
the Republic of Armenia adopted both in October 2019.
Following recommendations of OSCE experts, the
Government of Armenia also established a Corruption
Prevention Commission in November 2019.
Human Capital Development
Promoting the regulation of labour mobility particularly in
Central Asia is a key area of action to harness the economic
potential of migrants to improve household income and
GDP. In 2019, the OCEEA supported concerted actions to
improve the effectiveness of migration policies by involving
countries of origin and destination in annual round tables
held in Tashkent.
The OCEEA has also been engaged for a long time in
promoting the upskilling of marginalized women and youth
and in supporting an effective ecosystem for innovative

ENVIRONMENTAL CO-OPERATION
In 2019, the OCEEA continued to support activities aimed at
transboundary water co-operation, disaster risk reduction,
environmental good governance, hazardous-waste
management and potential security risks stemming from
climate change.
Transboundary Water Co-Operation
The OCEEA continued to focus on transboundary water
co-operation and water diplomacy in a number of river
basins in the OSCE area. Since 2017, the OCEEA has been

The Office of the Special Representative and Co-ordinator for Combating Trafficking in
Human Beings (OSR/CTHB) assists the OSCE participating States in their efforts to prevent
human trafficking, investigate and prosecute perpetrators and protect victims. In 2019,
the OSR/CTHB implemented a wide range of programmes using a “policy to practice”
approach.

TECHNOLOGY AND TRAFFICKING:
ADDRESSING NEW CHALLENGES AND
OPPORTUNITIES
In recent years, technology has transformed the human
trafficking landscape both in terms of how human traffickers
misuse it to advance their interests—including recruitment,
control and exploitation of victims—and in how it can be
deployed to advance the prosecution, protection and
prevention goals of the OSCE participating States.

Banner of the 19th
Alliance against
Trafficking in Persons,
which was held in Vienna
on 8 and 9 April 2019.

On 8 and 9 April 2019, more than 400 practitioners from
across the OSCE participating States and Partners for Cooperation took part in the 19th High-level Alliance against
Trafficking in Persons Conference.
The conference entitled “Using Technology to Combat
Trafficking in Human Beings: Turning a Liability into an
Asset”, highlighted the misuse of technology to facilitate
trafficking, as well as its use as a tool for preventive and
victim-protection measures. The urgent need to adopt
policies to disrupt ICT-facilitated trafficking was also a
significant focus.
Building impactful partnerships has also been a high
priority for the Office, including in the context of technology.
In 2019, the OSR/CTHB collaborated with Tech Against
Trafficking, a coalition of technology companies, on a
publication identifying over 300 tech tools for combating
trafficking in human beings (THB).
ETHICAL SUPPLY CHAINS AND PUBLIC
PROCUREMENT: LEADING BY EXAMPLE AT
THE OSCE AND BEYOND
While human trafficking for labour exploitation is one of the
most prevalent forms of THB, it is also among the least
addressed. In 2019, the OSR/CTHB supported participating
States by updating its Compendium of relevant reference
materials and resources on ethical sourcing and prevention
of trafficking in human beings for labour exploitation
in supply chains. Moreover, the Model Guidelines on
Government Measures to Prevent Trafficking for Labour
Exploitation in Supply Chains were published in all the
OSCE official languages.
The OSR/CTHB in co-operation with the United Kingdom
and the Ethical Trading Initiative, also organized the
42

International Conference on Tackling Modern Slavery,
Forced Labour and Human Trafficking in Public Sector
Supply Chains. The conference promoted the importance
of leadership and implementation of measures to prevent
THB in supply chains of administrations, governments and
multilateral organizations.
Leading by example, the OSR/CTHB also undertook
activities aimed at developing the capacities of OSCE
executive structures to prevent human trafficking in internal
procurement activities. In 2019, a pilot project conducted
with the OSCE Mission to Serbia in partnership with the
University of Nottingham to analyse procurement data for
risks of human trafficking was finalized.
The Office also aims to advance
implementation of harmonized
procurement measures across
international organizations.
Engagement with the UN’s 25th HighLevel Committee on Management
Procurement Network Meeting in
March 2019 marked an important first
step to achieve this goal. As a result,
a Task Force for the Development of a
Joint Approach in Combating Human Trafficking in Supply
Chains was established within the UN’s procurement
network.

FINANCIAL INVESTIGATIONS
AND TRAFFICKING
IN HUMAN BEINGS:
FOLLOWING THE MONEY

On the margins of the 19th Alliance Conference, participants can get a firsthand impression of how cutting-edge technology can be used to combat human
trafficking, Vienna, 8 April 2019. (OSCE)

Trafficking in human beings is
principally a financially motivated
crime. Financial evidence can
be used to identify victims
and perpetrators, and seizing
illegal profits can undermine the profit motives of
traffickers and support reparation for victims.
In November, the OSR/CTHB, in co-operation with the
Secretariat to the Liechtenstein Initiative’s Financial
Sector Commission on Modern Slavery and Human
Trafficking, housed at the UN University Centre for
Policy Research, published Following the Money:
Compendium of Resources and Step-by-Step Guide to
Financial Investigations Related to Trafficking in Human
Beings. The publication contains a compendium
of resources for financial investigations related to
THB, a comprehensive list of financial indicators of
THB and a step-by-step guide to help practitioners
in both the public and private sectors to develop
systems for financial investigations into THB.

COMBATING HUMAN TRAFFICKING ALONG
MIGRATION ROUTES: VICTIM IDENTIFICATION
AND ASSISTANCE
People in migration flows can be exposed to numerous
threats, including trafficking for sexual and labour
exploitation. The OSCE supports policymakers and
practitioners in adopting responses to THB in migration
flows that emphasize the identification and protection of
victims and accountability for criminal actors.
After consultation with relevant stakeholders from those
participating States most affected by migration, the
OSR/CTHB issued, in 2019, Uniform Guidelines for the
Identification and Referral of Victims of Human Trafficking
within the Migrant and Refugee Reception Framework
in the OSCE Region. The Guidelines aim to facilitate the
coordinated, harmonized and victim-centred identification
of trafficking cases within mixed migration flows across the
OSCE region.
SIMULATION-BASED TRAINING: BUILDING
CAPACITY THROUGH EXPERIENTIAL
LEARNING
The OSR/CTHB has been a pioneer in developing
simulation-based, anti-trafficking training exercises. The
training framework brings together law enforcement officers,
financial investigators, labour inspectors, prosecutors,
migration and asylum authorities, NGOs and social service
providers to tackle simulated cases of THB in a live-action
and multi-agency setting.
The simulation-based training accomplishes three
goals: It builds the skills and knowledge of practitioners,
disseminates OSCE principles and concepts throughout the
participating States and builds networks of practitioners that
have already led to the solving of real cases.

SECRETARIAT  n  Combating trafficking in human beings

The training has also been adapted to national, regional
and international contexts. In June 2019, the second
international Russian-language exercise in Kazakhstan
was undertaken with the support of the Regional Hub for
Countering Global Threats within the Academy of Law
Enforcement Agencies of Kazakhstan. In September, in
Italy, the first international English-language exercise with a
focus on Mediterranean migration routes took place; it was
hosted by, and carried out with the core support of, the
Carabinieri Center of Excellence for Stability Police Units
(CoESPU).
COUNTRY VISITS: IDENTIFYING GOOD
PRACTICES AND SHARING KNOWLEDGE
Country visits serve to establish a direct and constructive
dialogue with participating States on anti-trafficking policy
and to raise the profile of anti-trafficking efforts in the OSCE
region. In 2019, the OSR/CTHB undertook three country

Partnership is key to effective anti-trafficking
response systems and to the approach of the OSR/
CTHB. In 2019, in partnership with UN Women,
the OSCE served as the first non-UN entity to cochair the Inter-Agency Coordination Group against
Trafficking in Persons (ICAT). This ground-breaking
arrangement highlights the OSCE’s regional
expertise on THB and reflects the inclusiveness and
interagency co-operation that the ICAT stands for.

Gender equality is an important cross-dimensional component of the OSCE’s comprehensive
approach to security. It is also a priority area in the OSCE’s fit-for-purpose agenda. The
Organization has intensified its efforts to build internal capacities for mainstreaming gender
in all of its programmes, activities and initiatives. It also continues to provide vital support
to participating States in key areas such as implementing the women, peace and security
agenda; combating violence against women; and promoting the role of women in mitigating
the negative impacts of natural disasters and environmental degradation.

THE GENDER FOCAL POINTS NETWORK
The OSCE Gender Issues Programme co-ordinates an
Organization-wide network of Gender Focal Points (GFPs).
Currently, there are 88 GFPs across the Organization, in
the Secretariat, institutions and field operations. The GFPs
play an instrumental role in mainstreaming gender in OSCE
programmes and activities: They provide in-house capacity
to enhance knowledge and skills on gender equality and
to advise OSCE staff members on how to implement
gender commitments in practice. The GFPs also collect
and consolidate data used to measure progress made in
implementing the 2004 OSCE Action Plan for the Promotion
of Gender Equality.
GENDER PARITY ON PANELS
As part of the Secretary General’s commitment as an
International Gender Champion, he has made attaining
gender parity and ending male-only panels at OSCEorganized events a priority. In order to monitor progress, the
OSCE Gender Issues Programme conducted an analysis

44

of gender parity in 194 panels and conferences organized
by the OSCE in 2018 that covered all three dimensions of
security. This baseline research was discussed with staff
and participating States. The Gender Issues Programme
will continue to monitor and report on progress in achieving
gender parity in OSCE panels and events.
WOMEN, PEACE, AND SECURITY
A key OSCE contribution to the implementation of the
women, peace and security agenda is the support that
OSCE executive structures provide to the participating
States, upon their request, in designing and strengthening
their national action plans on UNSCR 1325. In 2019,
the Gender Issues Programme launched a project that
aims to accelerate the implementation of the women,
peace and security agenda in the OSCE region by
assessing progress and gaps in operationalizing national
action plans and developing capacities and strategies
to effectively implement them. The project’s results and
recommendations will support both interested governments

and psychological violence and on sexual harassment
and stalking by partners and non-partners. Women were
asked about their experiences of violence in general and in
connection with armed conflict and/or with their belonging
to a disadvantaged group. The findings demonstrate high
levels of violence against women in all countries surveyed
and the impact of violence on women’s physical and
psychological well-being. Recommendations included in the
survey reports aim to improve protection of, and support
for, survivors of gender-based violence. Throughout 2019,
local launch events and a dissemination campaign on social
media were held in the seven countries where the survey
was conducted. A launch event was also organized in
Kosovo. All reports are available on the project website.

WOMEN AS ADVOCATES FOR CLIMATE ACTION
Environmental degradation and climate change affect
women and men disproportionately. Women are more
vulnerable and account for a higher percentage of
casualties than men in the aftermath of natural and humanmade environmental disasters, in part due to unequal
access to information and resources. In July 2019, the
Gender Issues Programme, in co-operation with the Slovak
Chair-in-Office, the OCEEA and the Permanent Mission
of Ireland to the OSCE, brought together experts and
practitioners to reflect on how environmental challenges
impact women in particular and explore how to integrate a
gender perspective in environmental planning and decisionmaking. The event featured a conversation with Mary
Robinson, who, as former President of Ireland, former
United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and
former UN Special Envoy on Climate Change, brought
multiple perspectives to the discussion. The event raised
awareness on the part of participating States and executive
structures about the environment–gender–security nexus,
as well as gender-mainstreaming in environmental policymaking and disaster risk reduction.
COMBATING VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN
In 2019, the Gender Issues Programme published the
results of its Survey on the Safety and Well-being of
Women in South-Eastern and Eastern Europe. The study

In May 2019, the Gender Issues Programme, in
collaboration with the Department of Human Resources,
the Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine, the Project
Co-ordinator in Ukraine, the Office of Internal Oversight,
the Office of Legal Affairs, the Office of the Special
Representative and Co-ordinator for Combating Trafficking
in Human Beings and ODIHR, organized a round table
in Kyiv on preventing sexual exploitation and abuse by
individuals engaged by the OSCE. Representatives from the
OSCE Secretariat, institutions and field operations learned
about international good practices and discussed ways to
improve current OSCE policies and practices to prevent
sexual exploitation and abuse. As a first result, an OSCEwide task force was established on the topic, and a review
process of OSCE policies was initiated.

As the primary institution within the OSCE focusing on the human dimension of security,
the Warsaw-based Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) provides
support, assistance and expertise to governments and civil society in OSCE participating
States to promote democracy, the rule of law, human rights, tolerance and nondiscrimination and respect for the rights of Roma and Sinti.

“This year we are celebrating the thirtieth
anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall,
which gave so many people hope for a
future based on democracy and human
rights. It is for the sake of that future that
we must safeguard the principles to which
all OSCE countries have committed: strong
and independent institutions, the rule of
law, respect for the universality of human
rights and fundamental freedoms, and
democratic elections.”

ELECTIONS
ODIHR continues to support democratic elections across
the OSCE region. In 2019, ODIHR observed 15 elections in
14 participating States. Over the year, the Office published
some 60 election-related reports, which comprehensively
assessed electoral processes for consistency with OSCE
commitments, international obligations and other standards.
Final reports provided recommendations to participating
States on how their elections could be improved. In 2019,
the Office supported 13 participating States4 in their
efforts to address ODIHR’s electoral recommendations
by providing technical expertise during country visits or
reviewing proposed amendments to electoral legislation.
ODIHR additionally supported participating States by

DEMOCRATIZATION
ODIHR continued to support OSCE participating States
in 2019 in strengthening their judicial independence and
accountability. For example, the Office deployed a mission
to monitor a major judicial appointment process and also
released the publication Gender, Diversity and Justice.
The Office’s democratic governance work focused on
regional initiatives to promote parliamentary oversight (in
co-operation with the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly),
strengthening networks for women leaders at the national
and regional levels, engaging young leaders as academics
and policymakers and publishing new Guidelines on
Promoting the Political Participation of Persons with
Disabilities.

YOUTH FOR TOLERANCE
Last year, ODIHR convened its first forum of youth
activists entitled “Engaging the OSCE to Address
Anti-Semitism, Racism and Xenophobia”. Twentythree activists from 21 participating States were
introduced to the work of the OSCE and ODIHR in
this field, and they actively engaged in the annual
Human Dimension Implementation Meeting by
presenting young peoples’ concerns and proposals
in a number of working sessions and side events.

Markowski)

Another key aspect of ODIHR’s democratization work in
2019 was the promotion of transparency, openness and
inclusiveness in law-making processes. The Office reviewed
21 pieces of draft legislation from 12 different OSCE
participating States – often at the request of OSCE field
operations – on a range of issues, from the judiciary, political
party regulation and national human rights institutions to
equality, freedom of expression and hate crimes.
Throughout the year, ODIHR also responded to requests for
support in the field of migration and freedom of movement,
facilitating the sharing of good practices, contributing to the
development of migration-related policies and providing
capacity-building and awareness-raising activities focused
specifically on the special needs of women and youth.

HANDBOOK FOR THE
OBSERVATION OF ELECTION
DISPUTE RESOLUTION
As part of its efforts to develop
and refine its election observation
methodology, ODIHR published
a Handbook for the Observation
of Election Dispute Resolution in
September. Election observers
pay close attention to the
handling of election disputes, including the availability
of effective remedies, legal standing, accessibility
and timelines for handling cases. The Handbook
establishes a more systematic and comprehensive
approach to observing this key aspect of the election
process, thus contributing to greater protection and
promotion of the fundamental rights and freedoms
necessary for ensuring democratic elections.

provided practitioners in the criminal justice system with
a targeted new tool to tackle an often overlooked issue:
Preventing and Addressing Sexual and Gender-Based
Violence in Places of Deprivation of Liberty. ODIHR engaged
youth at the local level in dialogue about the right to
freedom of religion or belief and issued new policy guidance
in the publication Freedom of Religion or Belief and Security.
The Office’s support for human rights defenders, including
national human rights institutions, aimed to strengthen their
ability to prevent and address human rights violations and
to help victims obtain redress. ODIHR also worked with
partners on new tech tools that will provide training and
knowledge resources to human rights defenders working at
the grass-roots level.

HUMAN RIGHTS
To support security sector institutions in promoting and
protecting human rights in their day-to-day work with
communities, ODIHR trained law enforcement officials on
human rights–compliant policing of peaceful assemblies
and on human rights aspects of anti-terrorism issues and
the prevention of violent extremism and radicalization that
lead to terrorism.

TOLERANCE AND NON-DISCRIMINATION
In recognition of the need for a co-ordinated response
to address hate crime, ODIHR continues to work
alongside criminal justice actors, civil society and victim
representatives to this end. Throughout 2019, ODIHR held
training events and workshops that brought together state
institutions and civil society to jointly improve the monitoring,
reporting and recording of hate incidents. These efforts
were accompanied by the publication of new resources,
including a trainers’ manual for civil society workshops on
building coalitions for tolerance and non-discrimination, as
well as country-specific tools to guide police in recording
and investigating hate crimes.

ODIHR also continued to sensitize OSCE participating
States to crucial aspects of the prevention of torture and

contexts. In 2019, this included an expert round table on
intersectionality held by ODIHR to explore approaches
to preventing and responding to hate crimes committed
with multiple bias motivations. Addressing intolerance
and discrimination requires the combined efforts of many
communities, and ODIHR therefore held a meeting in
October where faith groups could share good practices
and gain practical skills on responding to manifestations of
intolerance.
CONTACT POINT FOR ROMA AND SINTI ISSUES
In 2019, ODIHR implemented local awareness-raising
activities in ten municipalities in North Macedonia, Poland,
Romania and Slovakia relating to the enrolment of Roma
children in pre-school and primary education, as well as
facilitating dialogue between parents, schools and local
authorities on challenges precluding Roma children,
especially girls, from accessing and continuing education.
In November, ODIHR organized the regional seminar
“Promoting equal access to quality early childhood
education for Roma and Sinti children”, which brought
together 30 experts and educational workers from ten
countries. ODIHR’s Contact Point on Roma and Sinti Issues
also held events to draw attention to Roma youth and
women as agents of change.

High
Commissioner
on National
Minorities

High Commissioner: Ambassador Lamberto Zannier
Budget: €3,504,000 (Unified budget), €829,330 (Extrabudgetary actual expenditure)
Staff: 20 international, 12 local (including 5 under extrabudgetary projects)
www.osce.org/hcnm

During the early 1990s, interethnic hostilities swept across Eastern Europe, causing
devastation and deep rifts between communities. To prevent this from happening again,
the position of OSCE High Commissioner on National Minorities (HCNM) was established
in 1992. Today, the High Commissioner regularly travels the length and breadth of the
OSCE area, identifying the main factors of potential instability within societies, as well as
the underlying causes of tensions, which, if neglected, could lead to crises and potentially
violent conflict within or among the 57 OSCE participating States. The role of the HCNM in
promoting sustainable integration of diverse societies remains key. Throughout 2019, High
Commissioner Lamberto Zannier carried out his mandate through quiet diplomacy, highprofile public events and programmatic work on the ground.

A common feature shared by many societies today is
their diversity. When managed well, diversity brings
untold benefits such as new skills, improved relations with
neighbouring states and trading opportunities. Conversely,
when identity issues become polarized, interethnic conflict
in society can increase. Policymakers can harness the
benefits of diversity with well-informed integration policies,
government bodies dedicated to interethnic relations and
diversity training toolkits for civil servants. In 2019, the
HCNM advocated for these and other inclusive measures
during his visits to OSCE participating States.
Multilingual education policies promote integration and social cohesion. The HCNM
organized a visit for multilingual education practitioners from Ukraine, Kyrgyzstan,
Kazakhstan and Georgia to trilingual primary schools in the Ortisei/St Ulrich/Urtijëi,
region of South Tyrol where pupils are taught in Italian, German and Ladin, 23

MULTI-YEAR COMMITMENTS
With conflict prevention, long-term policy solutions are
more enduring than quick fixes, as demonstrated by the
HCNM’s multi-year regional and country programmes. In
diverse societies, meeting the needs of all people requires
a balanced approach, especially in education. A recurring
event in the HCNM’s Central Asia Education Programme
is, therefore, the annual Regional Summer School on
Multilingual and Multicultural Education in Central Asia.
Ninety education professionals and policymakers took
part in last year’s edition. The HCNM also supported
the expansion of multilingual education piloting for
kindergartens in Kazakhstan and Uyghur-language schools
in the Almaty Region. Other milestones included a signed
memorandum of understanding between the HCNM and
Tajikistan’s Ministry of Education and Science to further
develop multilingual and multicultural education, as well
as training workshops and study visits for the Ministry of
Education of Ukraine on multilingual education.
Tolerance and understanding should be nurtured with
the next generation. A positive step are “tolerance and
diversity” courses targeting youth in Georgia. The HCNM
also pioneered the development of a bilingual Macedonian–
Albanian/Albanian–Macedonian phrasebook for general
use. The development of interactive content for the digital
versions of the phrasebook is also underway. Recognition
of the need for all citizens to learn the state language,

High Commissioner Zannier is committed to finding
concrete ways to prevent conflicts, particularly through
regional partnerships. Responding to UN Secretary-General
António Guterres’ call for greater collaboration on conflict
prevention, the office of the HCNM continued its series of
panel discussions at the UN. In July 2019, a follow-up panel
discussion enabled regional organizations such as the
African Union, the League of Arab States, the Organization
of American States and the OSCE, as well as the UN, to
exchange experiences and working methods in this field.

the participation of various groups, including minorities, in
media content production and delivery; and restraint by
states in their interference in other countries’ affairs.
Several high-profile events focusing on the HCNM’s
thematic guidelines and recommendations also provided
space for related issues such as integration, equality, nondiscrimination and statelessness. Round tables in Tashkent
and Bukhara, Uzbekistan, presented the HCNM’s Ljubljana
Guidelines on Integration of Diverse Societies, and events
in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan, and Nur-Sultan, Kazakhstan,
presented The Graz Recommendations on Access to
Justice and National Minorities. During one occasion, High
Commissioner Zannier observed: “In multi-ethnic societies,
it is important that law-enforcement agencies not only
reflect the ethnic diversity of society, but [that they] are also
trained to operate effectively in multi-ethnic environments
together with the communities involved.”
The year concluded with a conference in Sweden marking
the 20th anniversary of The Lund Recommendations on
the Effective Participation of National Minorities in Public
Life. The event, which brought together academics,
experts and practitioners, addressed issues of political
representation, as well as economic participation and
cross-border co-operation, and it offered a specific gender
angle. Epitomizing the High Commissioner’s approach,
it advocated the full participation of national minorities in
society as a pathway to integration with respect for diversity.

Representative: Harlem Désir
Budget: €1,603,100 (Unified budget), €508,427 (Extrabudgetary actual expenditure)
Staff: 17
www.osce.org/representative-on-freedom-of-media

The Representative on Freedom of the Media observes media developments in the
participating States, advocates and promotes full compliance with the Organization’s
principles and commitments in respect of freedom of expression and free media, and
responds to serious non-compliance therewith. 2019 was the first year since the adoption
of the Ministerial Council Decision on the Safety of Journalists in Milan in December 2018.

MAJOR ISSUES
In 2019, the OSCE Representative on Freedom of the
Media addressed, in particular, the safety of journalists
and responded to attacks and threats against them. Two
journalists were killed in the OSCE region in 2019: Lyra
McKee, who was shot while covering riots in Northern
Ireland, the United Kingdom; and Vadim Komarov, who
died after being attacked in Cherkasy, Ukraine. Many other
journalists were attacked, wounded or threatened because
of their investigations, reports or critical views. The fight for
the protection of journalist’s safety and against impunity is
a priority of the Office. During the year, the Representative
intervened over 300 times in 39 participating States on
incidents or legal issues that affect media freedom or the
work of journalists.

fines and attempts to reveal journalists’ sources. Several
journalists in different participating States, on whose behalf
the Representative intervened, were released in 2019.

The Office’s Safety of Female Journalists Online (#SOFJO)
project continued to raise awareness of the threats and
harassment specifically faced by female journalists online.
The Office organized screenings of the documentary film A
Dark Place in 16 participating States.

At the Global Conference for Media Freedom, in London in
July, the Representative, together with Special Rapporteurs
from the UN, the Organization of American States
and the African Commission on Human and Peoples’
Rights, issued a Joint Declaration on the Challenges to
Freedom of Expression in the Digital Age. This included
recommendations on building and maintaining a free, open
and inclusive Internet.

The legal safety of journalists was also a key issue
covered by the Office. Too many journalists are being
prosecuted and even detained because of their work. The
Representative intervened with authorities on their behalf
and called for the release of imprisoned journalists. He also
raised numerous cases involving the blocking of websites,
forced closures of media outlets, defamation, administrative

The Representative also intervened on new laws in
participating States on such issues as media regulation,
tackling terrorism and violent extremism, and new Internet
regulations that have an impact on media freedom. The
Representative assisted the participating States in ensuring
that such laws would be in line with OSCE commitments
and international standards on freedom of expression and
media freedom. The Office published legal reviews with
accompanying recommendations for Albania, Austria,
France, Kyrgyzstan, Montenegro, North Macedonia, the
Russian Federation, Slovakia and Uzbekistan.

PROJECTS

The Representative launched the second exchange
opportunity for journalists within the Cyprus Media Dialogue
project, with 15 journalists from both Cypriot communities
selected to work at a host media outlet for one week. The
project encourages and furthers dialogue and co-operation
between media and journalists across the island, and it
aims to advance accountable, quality journalism in Cyprus.
The Office also launched a new project on the impact
of artificial intelligence on freedom of expression. The
project aims to promote a clearer understanding of policies
and practices in the development and use of artificial
intelligence, and the profound impact this will have on the
future of the realization of human rights online, in particular
the freedom of expression and freedom of the media.

INSTITUTIONS  n  Representative on Freedom of the Media

The Office organized, in Vienna in February, the “#SOFJO
Increasing Opportunities for Freedom of Expression
and Media Plurality” conference on the safety of female
journalists online. More than 100 international media experts
and policymakers from across the OSCE region discussed
policy developments and challenges, the identification
of countermeasures and the nature of offences against
women journalists.
The Office organized, in Vienna in April, the conference
“Journalists Under Attack: A Threat to Media Freedom”,
which aimed to assist OSCE participating States in
implementing the 2018 Ministerial Council Decision on the
Safety of Journalists and to provide safe working conditions
for journalists. Over 200 participants from over 30 countries
discussed the safety of media workers and listened to
the testimonies of journalists who had suffered attacks
and those of the relatives, colleagues and friends of killed
journalists.
The Office took part in the OSCE’s Human Dimension
Implementation Meeting in Warsaw in September, with four
side events: one called “Journalism behind bars in Turkey”;
another on the impact of artificial intelligence on freedom
of expression; a screening of the SOFJO documentary A
Dark Place; and a fourth side event on media freedom and
tolerance and non-discrimination.
The Office of the Representative held, in Moscow in
November, a conference called “Freedom of the Media and
Safety of Journalists in the Russian Federation and in the
OSCE Region: Challenges and Opportunities in the Digital
Age”. The Office organized the event with the support of
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation.
The conference brought together representatives of diverse
Russian media (both independent and state-owned),
media experts and representatives of the authorities and
institutions of the Russian Federation.
In November, the Office, together with members of
the Transatlantic High-Level Working Group on Online
Content Moderation and Freedom of Expression, held
an event in Vienna that addressed the question of how to
curtail the spread of hate speech, violent extremism and
disinformation online while protecting free speech.

In 2019, the OSCE Presence in Albania continued to work with Albanian partners in support
of justice and electoral reform, the rule of law and progress towards gender equality; to
empower civil society and young people; to strengthen the capacities of the parliament;
and to fight corruption, illegal migration and trafficking in human beings.

JUSTICE REFORM
As part of the justice reform process, the Presence
provided technical support to new self-governing bodies by
fostering regional co-operation through peer-to-peer visits
and exchange of best practices. It also offered capacitybuilding activities for members of the justice institutions
in charge of the re-evaluation of judges and prosecutors,
aimed at enhancing their capacities in conducting the
process in an efficient manner.
ELECTORAL REFORM
The Presence assisted the parliamentary Ad Hoc
Committee on Electoral Reform in addressing ODIHR’s
recommendations on elections by organizing a number of
round tables and conferences. It also supported the Central
Election Commission in addressing the issue of the misuse
of state resources and in implementing the legal framework
on decriminalization process. The Presence also organized

BORDER MANAGEMENT CO-OPERATION
The Presence assisted in the drafting and
negotiation of Hot Pursuit Protocols between
Albania and its neighbors and facilitated on-theground exercises with law enforcement agencies.
This helped to significantly increase co-operation
and mutual trust between the Albanian border
police and their counterparts in the region.

a voter education campaign for Roma and Egyptian
populations and offered election training for police officers
engaged in election duties.
ANTI-CORRUPTION
The Presence supported the National Co-ordinator against
Corruption in conducting a mid-term evaluation of the
Intersectoral Strategy against Corruption. It also supported
the High Inspectorate on the Declaration and Audit of
Assets and Conflict of Interest by conducting capacitybuilding activities, providing technical assistance to the
institution in conducting an initial evaluation of whistleblower legislation and also by reviewing the legislation on
conflict of interest.
COUNTERING VIOLENT EXTREMISM (CVE)
The Presence supported the Albanian Co-ordination
Centre on CVE in holding outreach meetings across the
country, as well as co-ordination meetings with regional
partners and activities with neighboring states on CVE. It
provided training courses on the promotion of a police–
public partnership model in the prevention and countering
of violent extremism. Over 100 probation officers were
trained on CVE in prisons and probation, while more than
80 young offenders on probation were made aware of
violent extremism. Albanian officials were also trained on
combating cybercrime and cyber-enabled crime.
BORDER MANAGEMENT AND TRANSNATIONAL
THREATS
The Presence supported the Albanian State police in
tackling transnational threats by facilitating intensified crossborder and interagency co-operation and information
exchange. In addition to hosting working meetings at the
regional and central level between Albania and neighboring
countries to strengthen co-operation and ensure
uninterrupted communication between law enforcement
agencies in the region, the Presence also conducted an
assessment of the green border between Albania and
Montenegro and organized a study visit to the airport in
Pristina and a similar peer visit to the Integrated Border
Management Centre in Skopje.

the protection of minorities. The Presence also followed up
on legislative developments by monitoring and commenting
on legislation pertaining to the protection and promotion of
human rights.

ANTI-TRAFFICKING
The Presence supported Albania in combating all forms of
human trafficking and exploitation, with a particular focus
on child trafficking and child labor. The Presence focused
on policy development, inter-institutional co-ordination
and capacity development for professionals engaged
with child protection issues. In co-operation with the
Magistrates’ School, the Presence trained some 60 judges
and prosecutors on the new anti-trafficking legislation. In
order to address trafficking in the context of migration, it
also helped to develop new procedures for the treatment
of irregular migrants by strengthening the multi-agency
approach to anti-trafficking.

ASSEMBLY SUPPORT
The Presence continued to support Albanian’s Parliament,
the Assembly, in its efforts to improve its legislative and
oversight functions and to strengthen the capacities of
its administrative staff. It assisted various parliamentary
committees and members of parliament (MPs) in
broadening their networking and outreach efforts through
assessment visits at both the national and international
level. These activities had a dual impact in encouraging MPs
to establish stronger links with the public while at the same
time expanding knowledge of the Assembly’s functioning
among institutions under its oversight, as well as among a
diverse group of citizens in the areas and regions covered.
PRISON REFORM
The Presence worked with Albanian institutions to improve
the implementation of rehabilitation and reintegration
mechanisms for offenders in compliance with international
standards. It provided assistance aimed at improving
legislation related to the penitentiary system and the
Probation Service. Having identified the lack of a unified
practice of maintaining statistics in detention facilities
countrywide, the Presence organized a workshop aimed
at establishing unified and standardized guidelines on the
collection and reporting of statistics.
MEDIA FREEDOM
Following a government initiative to draft an anti-defamation
package of legislative amendments, the Presence provided
support for the OSCE Representative on Freedom of the
Media in advising the Albanian authorities with the aim of
ensuring that the laws are in compliance with European
standards on media freedom and freedom of expression.
The Presence also supported the local media by providing
a platform for discussion through a Media Partners Group
that is taking the first steps towards local ownership.

The OSCE Mission to Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) continued to play a vital role in
enhancing BiH’s ability to foster a sustainable and stable security environment, to strengthen
environmental governance and to encourage its consolidation as a democratic society
governed by the rule of law. The Mission supported key reforms and worked to promote and
protect the human rights of every citizen.
STRENGTHENING THE RULE OF LAW
Due to the Mission’s advocacy and capacity-building, the
Banja Luka District Court issued the country’s first judgment
awarding a victim of human trafficking full compensation.
The Mission also issued a spot report titled “War Crimes
Case Management at the Prosecutor’s Office of Bosnia and
Herzegovina”, which raised public awareness about systemic
problems hindering the processing of war crimes cases at
the state level, and consequently denying victims justice.
NON-DISCRIMINATORY QUALITY EDUCATION
The Mission supported the implementation of
recommendations from its report on “two schools under
one roof”. As a result, a Žepče school unified two journalism
clubs, while Maglaj and Stolac schools organized joint sports
activities and an environmental protection debate. The
Mission facilitated the implementation of the first-ever PISA
international student assessment in BiH, and the use of its
results for improving the quality of education in BiH.
STRENGTHENING INTER-RELIGOUS DIALOGUE
The Mission organized events across the country, including
workshops on inter-religious dialogue and peacebuilding
among Islamic, Catholic, Serbian Orthodox and Jewish
communities for youth and training on freedom of religion or
belief, in co-operation with ODIHR. Additionally, the Mission
conducted a mapping exercise with municipal commissions
to identify mechanisms of co-operation and promotion of
inter-religious dialogue at the local level.
SUPPORTING ANTI-CORRUPTION AT ALL LEVELS
The Mission supported the development of the BiH Anticorruption Strategy and the replication of the Sarajevo

Mission also published its second report on the effectiveness
of the judicial response to corruption, underscoring the
substantial failure to prosecute high-level corruption in BiH.
Furthermore, the Mission trained 750 civil servants of the
Federation of BiH and 600 institutional anti-corruption focal
points in Republika Srpska.
FUNDAMENTAL FREEDOMS
Marking the tenth anniversary of the Law on Prohibition
of Discrimination, the Mission launched a report on
discrimination in BiH with specific recommendations for
institutions. The Mission also supported the sixth OSCE
South East Europe Media Conference, which examined the
issues of media development and sustainability, safety of
journalists, legal and policy framework for media freedom,
and sustainable solutions for public service broadcasters.
RECONCILIATION
The Mission facilitated co-operation among five municipalities
in the Federation of BiH and Republika Srpska in the area of
the Majevica mountain range. After establishing a permanent
working group, the municipalities drafted a co-operation
plan and jointly mapped and cleared a bicycle path to boost
tourism in the area. The five Majevica municipalities, once
divided by battle lines, are now committed to building a
systemic partnership for sustainable tourism development.
The Mission organized a joint concert performed by pupils
from two ethnically divided music schools at the symbolically
significant premises of the pre-war joint music school of
Mostar. The event attracted significant attention from the

EXTREMISM
Cross-departmental Mission support led to the development
of guidelines for the prevention of VERLT through education
and media reporting on violent extremism and terrorismrelated incidents.
ARMS CONTROL
The Mission improved the physical security and safety of
ammunition and weapons stockpiles at storage sites across
BiH. The risk of accidents, theft and proliferation decreased,
owing also to Mission-procured intrusion detection systems
and firefighting equipment.

facility at an Armed Forces ammunition-testing laboratory,
augmenting the expertise of military personnel on weapons
and ammunition life-cycle management.
COMBATING GENDER-BASED VIOLENCE

of UNSCR 1325, as well as the socio-economic status of
women and their role in peacebuilding and BiH’s political
life. Additionally, the Mission finalized curricula on teaching
gender equality in political parties and organized train-thetrainer sessions for female members of a number of political
parties in BiH.
EMPOWERING YOUTH PARTICIPATION
The Mission continued to strengthen the role of its Youth
Advisory Group in the Mission’s activity planning and
implementation, which was supported by engagement with
the Mission’s youth focal points.

The annual Mission-supported Youth and Security School
enabled future security experts to engage with policymakers
and decision makers and thus to improve their knowledge of
security issues.
ENVIRONMENTAL ACTIVITIES
In expanding citizen access to information and involvement
in environmental decision-making, the Mission collaborated
with the NGO Eko Forum and the City of Zenica to establish
a new Aarhus Centre in the industrial centre of Zenica.
Together with Aarhus Centre Sarajevo and Sarajevo and
Istočno Sarajevo universities, the Mission implemented a
semester-long Environmental Legal Clinics Programme,
offering future lawyers practical experience of working
on real-life environmental cases. In fostering local-level
environmental action, the Mission organized a series of cleanup activities in communities struggling with illegal dumping.
The Mission facilitated an update of the document on
Disaster Risk Assessment from Natural and Other Disasters
in BiH, ensuring a strong foundation for disaster prevention
and preparedness planning.
PARTNERSHIPS
The Mission signed a co-operation statement with the Islamic
community in BiH, further strengthening long-standing
co-operation on prevention of VERLT and promotion of
freedom of religion and belief, including the development and
implementation of specialized training for imams. The Mission

The OSCE Mission continued to work closely with public institutions in promoting intercommunity dialogue and community rights, gender equality and youth participation;
enhancing public safety and security; facilitating election reform processes; and assisting
public universities in expanding media and information literacy teaching in the higher
education system.
INTER-COMMUNITY DIALOGUE
In 2019, the Mission continued to engage with institutions
to enhance communication and dialogue between
communities. In July 2019, following Mission facilitation, four
municipalities in the Mitrovicë/Mitrovica South region signed
the Inter-municipal Declaration to Promote Inter-community
Dialogue, which outlines municipalities’ commitment
to improving and strengthening relations between
communities through a variety of activities. In October
2019, Mitrovicë/Mitrovica South organized the first activity
stemming from the declaration, a youth camp bringing
together over 50 members of Kosovo Albanian, Kosovo
Serb, Kosovo Bosniak, Kosovo Roma, Kosovo Turk and
Kosovo Ashkali youth, who gave their feedback to municipal
officials on their projects and discussed finalization and
implementation of the 2020 Inter-municipal Activity Plan. Of
the 38 municipalities, 33 are multi-ethnic, 29 of which have
signed the declaration and are engaged in implementing a
variety of inter-municipal civic activities.
To help increase communication between communities,
the Mission organized, between March and June 2019,
Albanian and Serbian language classes in the Obiliq/Obilić
municipality. Youth forums for Albanian, Roma and Serb
communities focused on improving their advocacy and
negotiating skills, while also discussing the importance of
dialogue and understanding, issues of non-discrimination,
hate speech and hate crimes. A Youth Employment Camp
was held in an effort to increase employment opportunities
for young people from Roma, Ashkali and Egyptian
communities through training on how to write CVs and
cover letters, while employment fairs to increase their
employment prospects served as a medium between these
communities and companies, as well as international and
local organizations.
ENGAGING WITH YOUTH
The Mission stepped up its support for law graduates with
traineeship programmes with relevant institutions. In its
efforts to enhance access to justice in northern Kosovo, it
supported the inclusion of young legal professionals from
the four northern Kosovo Serb–majority municipalities in the
community of legal professionals in Kosovo. In co-ordination
with the Kosovo Bar Association, eight law graduates
were given one-year internships in law firms in northern
Kosovo. This is the third generation of young lawyers
benefiting from the internship programme supported by the
Mission. So far, 21 young law graduates have participated

GENDER EQUALITY AND MAINSTREAMING
The Mission strengthened its advocacy for the inclusion
of advanced domestic violence–related provisions in the
Criminal Code of Kosovo, which entered into force in
April 2019 with most of the Mission’s suggestions taken

expand the existing curricula on Media Literacy, Academic
Writing and Mass Communication from one to three
comprehensive courses. As of October 2019, modules from
the Mission-developed syllabuses are being taught in the
Journalism Department at UP.
COUNTERING VIOLENT EXTREMISM AND
RADICALIZATION THAT LEAD TO TERRORISM
In September 2019, the Mission organized a training
course on post-traumatic stress disorder in relation to
foreign fighters and spouses repatriated from Syria. The
training targeted psychiatrists, psychologists, teachers and
representatives of the Ministry of Internal Affairs. Upon the
request of the Kosovo Co-ordinator on Counterterrorism/
Countering Violent Extremism (CT/CVE), training was
organized with the aim of increasing knowledge and
necessary skills so as to develop a sound methodological
approach for the process of rehabilitating adults repatriated
from Syria.
The office of the Co-ordinator on CT/CVE was created
based on advice from the Mission, with a view to merging
strategies on violent extremism and terrorism. In addition,
the Mission, jointly with the Kosovo Police, delivered
presentations on preventing violent extremism through a
community policing approach to around 350 students and
university professors from public universities.

Office of the Representative on Freedom of the Media, the
Mission supported regional initiatives on issues involving the
media, including the safety of journalists.

With the completion of the assessment of the 2012–
2019 police reform process, the Police Directorate now
has a tool for evidence-based programme planning and
evaluation that ensures a gender perspective for use in the
further implementation of reforms.

Mission to
Serbia

Head of Mission: Ambassador Andrea Orizio
Budget: €6,258,600 (Unified budget), €1,348,469 (Extrabudgetary actual expenditure)
Staff: 21 international, 117 local (including 15 under extrabudgetary projects)
www.osce.org/mission-to-serbia

Building on its expertise and trusted position, the Mission worked in partnership with
Serbia’s institutions, media and civil society in 2019 to foster their ownership over the
country’s ambitious reforms. The Mission tailored its assistance to help Serbia strengthen
the rule of law and separation of powers; to foster an accountable security sector; to
combat organized crime, corruption and transnational threats; to increase media freedom
and improve ethics and professionalism; and to promote human rights, gender equality and
the integration of national minorities, while considering the important regional context. The
Mission most notably focused on two key endeavours – the inclusive development of the
country’s new media strategy and constitutional amendments on the judicial independence
– and engaged in OSCE-wide electoral efforts in view of elections planned for 2020.

COMBATING CORRUPTION, ORGANIZED
CRIME AND TRANSNATIONAL THREATS
In 2019, the Mission worked with the Ministry of Interior,
the prosecution and the judiciary to build their capacities
to combat constantly changing forms of corruption and
economic crime, cybercrime, organized crime, the financing
of terrorism and transnational threats. The Mission facilitated
meetings of the expanded Permanent Conference of
Organized Crime Prosecutors and supported operational
exchanges between the Task Force against Human
Smuggling and its regional counterparts.

SUPPORTING CITIZENS’ LINKS WITH THE
NATIONAL ASSEMBLY
The Mission has been strengthening Serbia’s Parliament,
the National Assembly, as a venue for dialogue, legislative
scrutiny and oversight. Despite strained party relations,
the Mission helped reinvigorate cross-party initiatives in
2019 such as the Green Parliamentary Group and the
Women’s Parliamentary Network, and it supported contacts
between women members of parliament (MPs) from the
region. Through mobile sessions and field visits, the Mission
also facilitated MPs’ contacts with citizens from across

the local level.
PROMOTING THE RULE OF LAW, DEMOCRATIC
VALUES, AND MEDIA LITERACY AMONG
YOUTH
Having pioneered an innovative youth mainstreaming
approach across its programmes, the Mission led several
youth education initiatives in 2019. The Mission helped
further develop curricula and teacher training in civic
education and media literacy, and it worked with law
faculties to strengthen students’ knowledge in the areas
of gender equality, non-discrimination, anti-corruption and
environmental protection. To help law students from national
minorities become part of Serbia’s legal community,
the Mission launched a two-year Legal Learning Project
for Serbian and Bosnian law students, building upon
successful bar exam training conducted earlier for Serbian
and Albanian law students. The Mission also supported
the Academic Alumni Network of high-achieving MA and
PhD students, and it taught young professionals about
the functioning of democratic institutions and political and
electoral systems during the fourth cycle of the Democracy
Academy.

officers towards citizens, to improve their communication
and to ensure a more inclusive police service. The Mission
also fostered a police partnership with Municipal Safety
Councils and built the capacities of local emergency
response services to effectively help the country’s most
vulnerable citizens. By promoting contacts between the
police, local authorities and civil society, the Mission worked
to improve the police response to domestic violence and to
promote UN Security Council Resolution 1325 on Women,
Peace and Security at the local level. The Mission also
worked together with the police, prosecution and journalists
to improve the safety of journalists.
CROSS-CUTTING APPROACH TO
DISCRIMINATION AND HATE CRIMES
To strengthen a comprehensive criminal justice response
to hate crimes, the Mission facilitated meetings of the
intersectoral working group of the police, prosecution, the
judiciary, the government, independent institutions and
civil society. The Mission also developed Guidelines for
Criminal Prosecution of Hate Crimes and organized a series
of comprehensive training sessions for prosecutors from
across Serbia. In 2019, the Mission also hosted a regional
conference on hate crime education and worked with civil
society to raise awareness of hate crime among youth. The
Mission also organized specialized training for the police to
recognize and respond to discrimination and bias motivation
with elements of hate crime.

Budget: €6,506,100 (Unified budget), €550,529 (Extrabudgetary actual expenditure)
Staff: 40 international, 114 local
www.osce.org/skopje

In 2019, the OSCE Mission to Skopje continued to support reforms pertinent to
judicial independence, media freedom, community rights, democratization, police
professionalization, strengthening Parliament and improving electoral processes. The
Mission focused on assisting further implementation of the Ohrid Framework Agreement
and provided early warning on security-related developments in the country.

EARLY WARNING
The Mission monitored local and national political and
intercommunity developments. Mission staff from Skopje
and Tetovo engaged with political interlocutors, civil society,
religious leaders and state and local authorities to provide
timely information on important developments. The Mission
reported on the security situation and implemented local
confidence-building activities with a focus on interethnic
dialogue and social inclusion.
STRENGTHENING THE RULE OF LAW
The Mission assisted the Ministry of Justice in implementing
the National Judicial Reform Strategy by helping to
introduce amendments to the Law on Criminal Procedure
and the new Criminal Code. It provided targeted capacity
building for 430 practitioners from judicial institutions on
criminal procedure, evidentiary procedure, direct and crossexamination, as well as appeals procedure.
TRIAL MONITORING
The Mission monitored more than 400 court hearings in 32
high-profile cases, including many that had the potential
to affect the security situation. The cases included those
arising from the illegal interception of communications
previously prosecuted by the Special Prosecutor’s Office
(SPO). The Mission published its second interim report on
the SPO cases which provided recommendations to the
prosecution, judiciary, Parliament and Government.

“The OSCE Mission to Skopje has been supporting the
implementation of the strategic plan of the Assembly. The
primary aim of this plan is to strengthen the representative
role of the Assembly, highlighting the Network of
Constituency Offices for MPs as an important mechanism
for outreach to citizens. The OSCE’s support for this
network, including capacity-building for MPs and office
assistants, has brought people closer to the decisionmaking process and made MPs more accountable to their
constituents.”

ADVANCING FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS
The Mission worked with 460 legal practitioners, 130
young people and 40 institutions and activists on effective
ways to address intolerance. It supported the authorities in
adopting the new Law on Anti-discrimination and Criminal
Code amendments pertaining to hate crime. The Mission
was instrumental in helping to register 123 hate crimes
and delivered countrywide public awareness campaigns
addressing gender bias against women and intolerance
during sporting events. To advance human rights in prisons,
the Mission supported the development of by-laws that
introduce into practice standards in line with the UN’s
Nelson Mandela Rules. It also monitored the functioning of
the complaints mechanism in prisons, including the female
wing of the largest prison in the country.

In 2019, the Mission expanded its “Learning from the
Women to Women” mentoring programme for women
in the police to other public sector institutions. In cooperation with the Ministry of Labour and Social
Policy, the Mission initiated a one-year programme
that aims at individual empowerment and further
career development for 20 mentors and 20 mentees
representing key ministries in the country.
“My participation in the mentoring programme for
women in the police was an extremely positive
experience. It made our section more visible
and recognizable. During the programme, I was
approached by many female police officers and,
more importantly, by male colleagues who requested
to be included in the mentoring process.”

Hrizantema Rendevska
Head of the Women’s Section of the Police Union

FOSTERING MEDIA FREEDOM
The Mission supported media development in the country
by implementing activities that improved communications
among journalists, police officers, judges and prosecutors.
The Mission also conducted a media literacy survey and
a major public campaign promoting media literacy, and it
supported a helpline for journalists who had been victims of
attacks.
STRENGTHENING THE ROLE OF PARLIAMENT
The Mission worked to build the capacity of Parliament
to more effectively assume its representational and
oversight roles. The Mission provided training for
parliamentarians and parliamentary staff, supported the
renewed constituency relations network and organized
study visits and networking opportunities. In addition, the
Mission worked with parliamentary committees to advance
oversight capacity and gender sensitivity.
SUPPORT FOR THE STATE ELECTION
COMMISSION
The Mission provided technical assistance to the State
Electoral Commission (SEC) as it organized the 2019
presidential election. With a longer-term focus, the Mission
supported the SEC with respect to electoral participation
on the part of people with disabilities, as well as gender
mainstreaming in electoral administration, including
conducting a gender audit of the SEC, the first of its kind in
South-Eastern Europe.

ADMINISTRATION REFORM
The Mission continued to be a key partner for the Ministry
of Information Society and Administration as it implemented
the Public Administration Reform Strategy. The Mission
supported the development of a merit-based, equitable
and professional human resources management system
through the revision of laws on public sector employees and
on civil servants.
SUPPORTING FURTHER
PROFESSIONALIZATION OF THE POLICE
In support of the professionalization of law enforcement in
North Macedonia, the Mission facilitated the development
of the Ministry of Internal Affairs’ new strategies on human
resource management, training, disciplinary procedures,
community engagement and communication. The Mission
also supported a joint working group set up by the police
and prosecution to draft a new protocol for co-operation
between the two institutions. The Mission also conducted
a gender equality and mainstreaming workshop for senior
police officers and trained 72 junior police officers on
policing in a multicultural context, thus contributing to the
development of more transparent and democratic policing
practices.
PARTNERSHIPS
The Mission worked closely with national and local
authorities and agencies, political parties, civil society
organizations, religious communities, media associations,
diplomatic missions and international organizations.

Mission to
Moldova

In 2019, the OSCE Mission to Moldova continued facilitating the Transdniestrian settlement
process in line with the principles endorsed by all 57 OSCE participating States: the territorial
integrity and sovereignty of the Republic of Moldova, with a special status for Transdniestria
within Moldova’s internationally recognized borders.

CONTINUED DIALOGUE IN THE
TRANSDNIESTRIAN SETTLEMENT PROCESS
With a particular focus on conflict resolution and
confidence-building by the Slovak Chairmanship, the
Transdniestrian settlement process benefited from the
strong support of the OSCE Chairmanship in 2019. The
Chief Negotiators from the Republic of Moldova and
Transdniestria and their teams continued working towards
improving the lives of people on both banks and achieving a
final settlement.

enabled them to pursue studies abroad. Moldovan farmers
from the Dubasari district reported tilling their lands and
collecting harvests without any obstruction.

The Sides achieved notable progress in facilitating
unimpeded travel by officials and consolidated the
achievements reached since 2016, in particular with
regard to the Berlin-plus package of confidence-building
measures. These measures were jointly designed by the
Sides and reflect the internationally agreed principles of
the Transdniestrian settlement that define the Mission’s
mandate.

The international partners were particularly unified in their
efforts to advance the settlement process during a period
of political transition in Moldova. This was reflected in highlevel visits by OSCE Chairperson-in-Office Miroslav Lajčák
and Secretary General Thomas Greminger, as well as a
joint visit by the mediators and observers in the 5+2 format
led by the Special Representative of the Chairperson-inOffice, Franco Frattini. The latter was key to resuming the
talks between the two Sides after a six-month break. Later
in the year, the Sides continued their dialogue during a 5+2
round of talks in Bratislava and at a conference on CBMs in
Bavaria organized with the support of the German Federal
Foreign Office.

For the first time in years, the number of pupils enrolled
in Moldova-administered Latin-script schools located
in Transdniestria increased. Jointly operated vehicle
registration offices in Ribnita and Tiraspol enabled more
than 3,000 Transdniestrian vehicle owners to travel on
international roads with Moldovan neutral-design licence
plates. More than 330 students from the Transdniestrian
university received apostilles on their diplomas, which

In a statement adopted on 6 December at the 26th
OSCE Ministerial Council, the foreign ministers of the 57
OSCE participating States commended the commitment,
leadership and political will of the two Sides, which led to
the resolution of the above-mentioned long-standing issues
affecting lives of people on both banks.

groups. The Mission commissioned a technical assessment
of the Gura Bicului–Bychok bridge, which is part of an
international transport corridor. The assessment provided
an estimate of repair works necessary to bring the bridge
to its initially designed capacity and to unlock economic
potential.
In 2019, Chisinau and Tiraspol engaged in an active
discussion of issues related to the protection of human
rights both in the working groups and among civil society.
The Mission organized a workshop on human rights
monitoring for ombudspersons’ representatives from both
banks and 37 confidence-building activities for legal and
civil society professionals. These activities promoted better
communication, co-operation and capacity-building for
professionals on topics related to the thematic areas of the
expert working groups, such as gender equality, obtaining
civil status documents and combating human trafficking.
SUPPORTING EFFORTS TO PROMOTE
TOLERANCE AND INCLUSIVITY
The Mission continued supporting Moldova’s efforts to fulfil
its human rights obligations and to promote tolerance and
inclusivity, which are important CBMs for the settlement
process.
The Mission continued assisting the Moldovan Government
in implementing the national strategy on the consolidation
of interethnic relations, promoting efforts to combat hate

crimes and increasing awareness and understanding of the
Holocaust in a local context. One of the highlights of this
co-operation was the development of an optional course
called “The Holocaust: History and Life Lessons”, which
addresses the issue of the Holocaust in a local context.
Since the start of the 2019/2020 academic year, the course
has been offered to high school students across Moldova.
The Mission provided expert support to the development of
the course and a supplementary methodological guide for
teachers.
ENGAGING THE NEXT GENERATION
As a confidence-building measure, the Mission organized,
for the sixth time, a Model OSCE for young people from
both banks of the Dniester/Nistru River to improve their
understanding of compromise and consensus, as well as
to establish gender hubs in five regions of Moldova, which
provide a venue where young people can talk about gender
equality and issues of domestic violence.
MONITORING THE SECURITY ZONE
In 2019, the Mission, in keeping with its mandate and
the 2004 Agreement on the Principles of Co-operation
between the Mission and the Joint Control Commission
(JCC), continued to gather information on the situation in the
Security Zone. The observations collected during over 150
monitoring visits were shared with all the delegations to the
JCC and all OSCE participating States, including the host
country.

Since the start of the 2019/2020
academic year, 35 schools in
Moldova have offered high school
students an opportunity to study
an optional new course called “The
Holocaust: History and Life Lessons”.
Designed with expert support from
the OSCE, the course promotes
tolerance and mutual respect.

Special
Monitoring
Mission to
Ukraine

Chief Monitor: Ambassador Yaşar Halit Çevik
Budget: €100,8 million for the mandate period from 1 April 2019 to 31 March 2020
(€84,7 million from assessed contributions and €16,1 million from extrabudgetary
contributions). Total expenditure as of 31 December 2019 is € 69,1 million, including €5,6
million extrabudgetary actual expenditure.

The OSCE Special Monitoring Mission (SMM) to Ukraine was deployed in March 2014. The
SMM is an unarmed civilian mission operating 24/7 with 10 monitoring teams throughout
the country. The Mission’s mandate includes establishing facts, gathering information
and reporting on the security situation throughout Ukraine. The SMM also monitors and
supports respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, including the rights of persons
belonging to national minorities, and facilitates dialogue. With over 1,300 staff members, the
SMM aims to contribute to reducing tension and fostering peace, stability and security.

MONITORING OF THE SECURITY SITUATION IN
EASTERN UKRAINE
The Mission continued to apply a comprehensive approach
to the monitoring of the security situation, including its
human dimension, in eastern Ukraine. More specifically,
the Mission continued to support the implementation
of the Minsk agreements by monitoring and reporting
on compliance with their various provisions, including
adherence to the ceasefire, withdrawal of proscribed
weapons and the disengagement of forces and hardware,
as well as relevant mine action activities.
In 2019, the Mission recorded four percent fewer ceasefire
violations compared with 2018, especially following a
recommitment to the ceasefire, which started on 21 July.

The SMM continued to observe the presence of weapons,
some of which were in or near populated areas.
The SMM monitored the disengagement of forces and
hardware in the Stanytsia Luhanska disengagement area,
as well as the renewed disengagement process in the
Petrivske and Zolote disengagement areas. To that end, the
Mission enhanced its presence on the ground, including
through the use of technical means – additional SMM
cameras and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).
Disengagement near Stanytsia Luhanska enabled the repair
of the broken section of the Stanytsia Luhanska bridge, as
decided in the framework of the TCG. Part of the bridge had
been destroyed in 2015 due to the conflict, adding to the

and those with limited mobility, who had to walk on unstable
and steep makeshift ramps to cross the contact line on a
daily basis at the only entry–exit checkpoint (EECP) in the
Luhansk region. On 20 November, the new section of the
bridge opened for civilians.

SMM OUTSIDE DONETSK AND LUHANSK
REGIONS
In line with the OSCE’s mandate and its approach to
comprehensive security, the SMM continued to implement
its mandate across Ukraine. Eight monitoring teams outside
Donetsk and Luhansk regions regularly monitor, among
other things, the following issues: the security situation;
the situation concerning internally displaced persons and
national minorities; the impact of, and reaction to, decisions
and policies adopted by the government in relation to the
crisis in and around Ukraine; freedom of the media and
expression; and mandate-related high-profile court cases.

The SMM also continued to monitor other aspects of the
impact of the conflict on civilians. It recorded 147 civilian
casualties (19 fatalities and 128 injured) and damage to
about 550 civilian properties, including 15 operational
educational facilities. Civilians’ freedom of movement
remains limited: only five EECPs are operational along the
almost 500-kilometre-long contact line. The Mission issued
a thematic report on the challenges civilians face when
crossing the contact line.
The Mission continued to observe anti-tank mines and
unexploded ordnance (UXO), including some for the
first time, both in government- and non-governmentcontrolled areas. Some were seen near residential areas,
EECPs and roads frequently used by civilians and the
SMM. Additionally, the Mission issued a thematic report
highlighting the threats posed by mines and UXO: between
1 January and 31 December 2019, 11 civilians were killed
and 36 injured due to the explosion of mines, UXO or
improvised explosive devices.
The Mission’s freedom of movement continued to be
restricted, predominantly in non-government-controlled
areas, particularly in parts of the southern Donetsk region
and border-crossing areas near the border with the Russian
Federation. The use of the Mission’s technical means
for remote observation as a supplement to the physical
presence of SMM patrols allowed the Mission to partially
mitigate this and other impediments. Notwithstanding,
SMM UAVs continued to be subjected to signal interference
and small-arms fire on a regular basis on both sides of the
contact line.
The Mission dispatched 3,714 patrols in Donetsk and
Luhansk regions and facilitated 1,141 “windows of silence”
(localized adherence to the ceasefire) to enable repairs and
maintenance of critical civilian infrastructure on both sides
of the contact line. The SMM published a thematic report
on this topic, highlighting that such work helped restore,
among other things, water, gas and electricity to over 4
million people.

FIELD OPERATIONS  n  Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine

TECHNOLOGY
The Mission proved to be agile in responding to rapidly
changing developments on the ground, tailoring the
use of technology to support monitoring patrols on
both sides of the contact line. Twenty-eight static
cameras show images from along the contact line 24/7.
This, combined with footage from unmanned aerial
vehicles and other aerial imagery, constitutes partial
mitigation against security risks, including the presence
of mines and UXO, and helps overcome freedom-ofmovement restrictions. The use of technology has been
particularly instrumental in the Mission’s monitoring
and verification of the withdrawal of forces and
hardware from the three pilot disengagement areas.

Since the establishment of the Orthodox Church of Ukraine,
the Mission has been following developments, in particular
changes in affiliation at the local level.
MEDIATION
At TCG meetings held in 2019, the Chief Monitor, in his
capacity as Co-ordinator of the Working Group on Security
Issues, called for measures that resulted in a reduction
in tension and the protection of civilians. The sides also
agreed to recommit to the ceasefire (starting from 21 July)
and on renewed disengagement of forces and hardware
from the areas near Zolote and Petrivske and, for the first
time, near Stanytsia Luhanska. Additionally, agreement
was reached to repair the broken section of the Stanytsia
Luhanska bridge (see above).
GENDER MAINSTREAMING
The Mission continued to mainstream its gender-equality
action plan across all activities, in particular throughout
the monitoring and reporting cycle, which resulted in a
more in-depth understanding of security, socio-economic
and human dimensions. Although women remain underrepresented, the Mission continued taking steps to improve
gender balance, including for managerial positions. The
SMM also continued engaging with women involved in
dialogue initiatives and provided briefings to women about
the SMM’s mandate and activities.
PUBLIC COMMUNICATION
In 2019, the Mission carried out 76 outreach activities,
raising awareness of the SMM’s role, activities and
objectives, in particular comprehensive security with civic
engagement and dialogue. In addition to addressing gender
equality issues and prevention of gender-based violence,
the Mission focused on UNSCR 1325 on Women, Peace
and Security, which recognizes that sustainable peace
is built on broad inclusivity. A series of stories for social
media called “Women on the Contact Line”, on both female
community leaders and female monitoring officers living
and working in conflict-affected areas, as well as videos
“I used to visit my father, who lives on the other side
of the contact line, only once or twice a year. Now I
can go every week. I am very happy that the bridge
was rebuilt. This means I can see my father much
more often. For that, I have to thank the OSCE.”

awareness activities among children living along the contact
line.
“For children living close to the contact line, mine
awareness is a sad but necessary part of growing
up. We conduct outreach in schools, which includes
responding to real-life experiences as recounted
by students who find tripwire mines and explosive
objects near their schools and their houses, or in
parks. We teach practical ways to minimize the
risks, but kids can only be safe when the mines are
removed. As long as they are laid and weapons
fired, children along the contact line remain at risk.
In the absence of demining, safe-behaviour rules
are the difference between life and death.”

“We are exposed to the risks of mines and
UXO here. There is a military presence in the
village, so people think we are safe, but mines
choose no insignia, age or sex, as the SMM has
shown us. We are grateful for these sessions
because they raise both teachers’ and children’s
awareness about the risks; everyday prevention
and repetition will keep us safe in the long run.”

In 2019, the 20th anniversary of the OSCE Project Co-ordinator’s work in Ukraine provided
an opportunity to highlight joint efforts aimed at strengthening democracy, rule of law,
human rights and security of the country’s people. In pursuit of those goals, the Project Coordinator continued achieving practical results through projects implemented across all
OSCE dimensions, with several examples highlighted in this report.

GOOD PRACTICES AND TECHNOLOGIES HELP
PEOPLE USE THEIR VOTING RIGHTS
Millions of Ukrainians went to polling stations nationwide
three times in 2019 to elect a president (in two rounds of
voting) and a new parliament. To help prepare for these
elections, the Project Co-ordinator updated its online
training system for election commissioners and developed
and distributed 200,000 brochures outlining administrative
procedures to about 30,000 polling stations. At the
parliamentary elections, the OSCE supported an online
training system that was used by 138,000 people, mostly
leading members of district and precinct commissions;
almost half of them used the resource more than once.
International observers, notably ODIHR, stated that the
election processes were well administered, and opinion
polls showed increased trust on the part of Ukrainians in
democratic procedures.

otherwise. Some 315,000 Ukrainians used this opportunity
to enable them to vote in the presidential election, and
280,000 people changed their registered address for the
parliamentary election.
The data of 35.6 million people stored in the State Voter
Register was well protected with software and equipment
provided by the Project Co-ordinator in late 2018, with
no cyber-disruptions reported during either election. To
strengthen the transparency of the election administration,
the CEC used the OSCE-procured equipment to start
showing its meetings online in November.

Flexibilities offered by the digital voter register, established
years earlier with the support of the Project Co-ordinator,
enabled the Central Election Commission (CEC) to simplify
the procedure used to change voters’ registered address.
This eased the situation for voters who were not living or
working in the area of their registration, and it was of critical
importance for those displaced by the conflict in the eastern
part of the country, who would not have been able to vote

DIALOGUE AND PRACTICAL INSTRUMENTS
FOR CO-OPERATION BETWEEN THE
AUTHORITIES AND CIVIL SOCIETY
In a move to recognize the value of dialogue for managing
conflicts, the National Agency of Ukraine for Civil Service
proposed making dialogue a part of the new public service
culture, with a memorandum to this effect signed by the
Agency and the Project Co-ordinator. The government
used OSCE support in organizing dialogues to address
reform challenges in the education of national minorities,
decentralization, public administration and healthcare. To
strengthen the community of local experts in dialogues,
the Project Co-ordinator trained 340 civil servants and

activists, 15 of whom received mentorship support in
running dialogues to address a variety of conflicts in their
communities.
In promoting practical ways to enhance co-operation
between the authorities and civil society, the OSCE
trained 704 officials and staff from 693 non-governmental
organizations (NGOs) on public consultation mechanisms,
management of state-funded projects and provision of
social services by civil society. An online course on statefunded projects was launched. In addition, Kyiv and
Cherkassy selected five civil society organizations as
providers for palliative care services as part of an OSCEsupported pilot effort.
INTERAGENCY CO-OPERATION TO COMBAT
HUMAN TRAFFICKING GOES LOCAL
2019 capped five years of efforts by the OSCE Project
Co-ordinator to establish a functional system to provide
assistance to survivors of trafficking in human beings and
to prosecute perpetrators of this crime in 13 regions of
the country, including the capital city of Kyiv. The purpose
was to develop a national referral mechanism (NRM) – a
system where such work is done through co-operation
among social service providers, law enforcement, medical
practitioners, educators and NGOs. To enable NRMs at
the local level, the Project Co-ordinator trained 26,480
NRM stakeholders and supported 750 meetings for
multidisciplinary co-ordination councils.
As the remaining regions in the country benefit from support
from the IOM in this regard, the co-ordinated efforts of the
OSCE and the IOM have resulted in an overall improvement
in government response: In 2014, only 27 people were
recognized as victims, with 86 criminal cases opened, while
185 people were recognized as victims in 2019, and 306
investigations were launched. Co-operation also resulted in
eight nationwide information campaigns to warn Ukrainians
of the risks associated with trafficking.
PREVENTION OF CHEMICAL SECURITY RISKS
STRENGTHENED
The Project Co-ordinator helped the Medved’s Research
Center of Preventive Toxicology, Food and Chemical Safety
of the Ministry of Health of Ukraine establish a national
reference centre that will support national authorities with

credible analysis of chemicals to respond to incidents and
conduct investigations. With equipment provided by the
Project Co-ordinator, the Centre will be able to reliably
identify unknown toxins.
To help Ukraine enhance chemical security at its borders,
the OSCE Project Co-ordinator taught 100 customs officers
and border guards how to detect dangerous substances
and respond to incidents: This was done at training grounds
and during interactive simulation exercises at land, air and
sea border-crossing points.
As chemical security risks are exacerbated by ongoing
hostilities in industrialized eastern Ukraine, the Project Coordinator worked to strengthen water monitoring in the
basin of Siverskyi Donets and performed an environmental
audit of three endangered enterprises near the contact line
to produce recommendations on disaster prevention. To
spread awareness of conflict-related environmental risks, a
study tour for 15 journalists was organized to the region.

Observer
Mission at
the Russian
Checkpoints
Gukovo and
Donetsk

Chief Observer: Ambassador György Varga
Budget: €1,499,200 (for the period from 1 February 2019 to 31 January 2020)
Staff: 22 observers, two Vienna-based staff (Chief of Fund Administration and
Administrative/Finance Assistant)
www.osce.org/observer-mission-at-russian-checkpoints-gukovo-and-donetsk

In 2019, the Observer Mission marked the fifth anniversary of its deployment at the two
Russian checkpoints Gukovo and Donetsk. Operating under the principles of impartiality
and transparency, the Observer Mission (OM) has ensured an uninterrupted presence
at the two border-crossing points (BCPs) since the beginning of its mandate. As part of
the OSCE’s overall efforts to foster stability and security in the region, the OM continues
to represent a unique and reliable source of information on movements across the two
BCPs. The OM continues to issue weekly updates and spot reports, which inform the
Chairmanship, the participating States and the OSCE Secretariat and institutions about
movements across the two BCPs. Originally distributed in English, these reports have
also been distributed in Russian since July 2017. Last year, the OT issued 12 spot reports
concerning Russian convoys bound for Ukraine. The OSCE Permanent Council extended
the mandate of the Observer Mission until 31 May 2020. As of 2018, following a decision
of the Permanent Council, the usual duration of the OM’s mandate was extended to four
months instead of three.

Since the launch of the Mission on 30 July 2014, the OM’s
mandate has remained unchanged, tasking the OSCE
international observers with monitoring and reporting on the
situation at the checkpoints (BCPs) of Donetsk and Gukovo,
as well as on the movements across the border.
The Mission continues to implement a 24-hour shift rotation
system at the two border checkpoints. The Observer
Mission is currently working with 22 observers – including
the Chief Observer – from 15 participating States. At the
moment, the Observer Mission ranks sixth among the
16 OSCE field operations in terms of both the number of
international secondees and the number of seconding
states.
CONTACTS WITH RUSSIAN AUTHORITIES AND
THE MEDIA
The Observer Mission continued to strengthen its
working relationship with the authorities present at both
border checkpoints, as well as with the Rostov Regional
Administration and the Rostov representative office of
the Foreign Ministry of the Russian Federation. The Chief
Observer also held meetings at the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs of the Russian Federation in May 2019.
The Observer Mission also continued to co-operate with
representatives from local and regional media outlets in
order to help the local population better understand the
Mission’s mandate and the role of the OSCE in the region.

of the fifth anniversary of the deployment of the OM, the

my reports to the OSCE Permanent Council, I have
had the opportunity to realize that the geographical
scope and the content of the Observer Mission’s
mandate continue to remain the main differences
between the positions of the participating States. The
Observer Mission has gathered enough experience
during the last five years to be able to react in a
quick way to potential operational changes based
on the consensus of the participating States.”

Chief Observer to RIA Novosti on 31 July 2019

OM’s activity was actively followed by numerous Russian
and Ukrainian news agencies. The Chief Observer gave
interviews to several media agencies on the OM’s activities.
OBSERVATION TRENDS
In 2019, the Mission’s observers noted a 57 per cent
decrease compared to 2018 in the number of people in
military-style uniforms crossing at the two checkpoints. The
number of passenger cars and other vehicles crossing the
border remained steady throughout the year.
PARTNERSHIPS
Good working relations, information exchange and cooperation in relevant areas continued between the OM and
the SMM in 2019. The OM regularly delivered information to
the SMM on trains crossing the border at the Gukovo BCP
and on convoys crossing the border at the Donetsk BCP.
On 9 July, Chief Observer Ambassador Varga met in Kyiv
with the newly appointed Chief Monitor, Ambassador Halit
Çevik, to discuss areas of co-operation and to maintain
synergy in the OSCE’s activities.

In 2019, the OSCE Programme Office in Dushanbe celebrated both the 25th anniversary
of the OSCE’s presence in Tajikistan and the tenth anniversary of its Border Management
Staff College (BMSC). The Office expanded its engagement with the host country to
support the implementation of its commitments in all three dimensions of security. This
was evidenced by a newly introduced focus on disaster risk reduction, practical support
and awareness-raising to pave the way for Tajikistan’s ratification of the UN Convention
on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and investing in the knowledge and skills of
young people. The Office also focused on increasing national ownership and regional cooperation throughout its work, with the inauguration of the Regional Explosive Hazards
Training Centre in Dushanbe and regional, tailored training courses for law enforcement
from all five Central Asian states and Afghanistan, just being some of the examples.

COUNTERING SECURITY THREATS: STRENGTHENING
REGIONAL CO-OPERATION
The Office has increasingly applied a regional lens to
addressing explosive threats, while furthering the capacity
of, and partnership with, Tajikistan’s Ministry of Defence.
This culminated in the inauguration of the Regional
Explosive Hazards Training Centre in Dushanbe in 2019.
The Centre will serve as an internationally recognized
platform for training instructors on explosive ordnance
disposal, and it will foster co-operation among relevant
ministries and agencies in Central Asia and beyond.
Tajikistan’s First Deputy Minister of Defence, the US
Ambassador to Tajikistan and the Head of the OSCE
Programme Office in Dushanbe officially opened the
Centre in August 2019. The Ministry of Defence will take full
ownership of the Centre by 2021 and will thereby ensure
sustainability and institutionalization of the training offered
by the Centre. The Office’s Explosive Hazards Programme
has also promoted regional confidence-building, jointly
training experts from all five Central Asian states and

MAINSTREAMING YOUTH ENGAGEMENT
The Office involved young people in its work from a
variety of angles. Initiatives included expanding the
Network by Consensus, a platform engaging over
500 young people from Tajikistan and the region to
actively shape civic and political life; holding start-up
weekends that focused specifically on improving the
skills of young female entrepreneurs; and nurturing
the OSCE-established network of young gender
champions, who tackle gender stereotypes in all
areas of Tajikistan through a peer-to-peer approach.

IMPROVING DISASTER
RISK AWARENESS IN TAJIK
COMMUNITIES
Some 93 per cent of the territory of
Tajikistan is mountainous, making the
country prone to natural disasters
and the impact of climate change.
In its newly developed Disaster Risk
Reduction project, the Office focused
on building community resilience
and enhancing national emergency
response. Together with Tajikistan’s
Committee on Emergency Situations
and Civil Defence (CoESCD) and
the Tajik Red Crescent Society,
the Office increased the disaster
risk awareness of 1,000 people
from remote villages in the Khatlon
region by offering tailored courses
on disaster preparedness, climate

assisted the CoESCD and the local
administration in clearing 45,900
cubic metres of soil and debris caused by mudflows,
which ensures access to, and the safety of, 620 affected
households, a school and a highway in the Shaartuz district.
The CoESCD also organized a large-scale simulation
exercise to test the government’s preparedness to respond
to natural disasters and emergency situations, to which
the Office and other partners of the Rapid Emergency
Assessment and Co-ordination Team contributed.
PROMOTING THE RIGHTS OF PERSONS WITH
DISABILITIES
Tajikistan signed the UN Convention on the Rights of
Persons with Disabilities in 2018. Support from the Office
to advance ratification constituted a strong focus in 2019.
The Office co-operated with government and civil society
across Tajikistan to raise awareness about the Convention,
local laws and issues of restricted rights through training,
public events and the production of videos using sign
language. The Office empowered more than 80 persons
with disabilities and representatives of disability rights
organizations to claim their rights through a series of
inclusive moot courts, where they practised their newly
obtained skills in fictitious court cases, which included
appeals, lines of argument andaddressing the court.
Round-table discussions held throughout the country for
several hundred people helped to expand awareness and

gather momentum to promote the
participation of persons with disabilities
in public life and establish a rightsbased approach to disability. Feeding
into these public debates, government
and community representatives jointly
visited public buildings to assess their
accessibility for disabled persons.
The Union of People with Disabilities
followed up on improvements discussed
during these visits, which were coorganized by the Office, to ensure a
tangible impact.
CELEBRATING THE TENTH
ANNIVERSARY OF THE
BORDER MANAGEMENT
STAFF COLLEGE
Since its establishment in 2009, the
BMSC provided high-quality education
for more than 3,400 border security
management officials from 45 OSCE
participating States and nine countries
representing the Partners for Co-operation. Paying
particular attention to Tajikistan’s security co-operation with
Afghanistan, 55 per cent of staff course participants were
from Afghanistan and Tajikistan. Since the introduction
of the annual women-only staff course in 2014, female
participants have accounted for nearly half of the annual
staff course graduates. The tenth-anniversary celebration at
the beginning of October was attended by 16 visiting heads
of OSCE delegations in the framework of a week-long
working visit to Central Asia.
In the spirit of providing internationally recognized and
specialized training, the College successfully ran its
one-year Postgraduate Diploma in Border Security and
Management for Senior Leadership course for 21 border
and customs officials, the first completed course since its
accreditation by Estonia’s Quality Agency for Higher and
Vocational Education in 2018. In September, Slovakia’s
OSCE Chairmanship hosted the BMSC’s first-ever
advanced course, which explored the connection between
security sector governance and reform and border security
and management. Furthermore, the College broadened
its educational programme by hosting a joint Afghan–
Tajik–Turkmen regional border management awareness
workshop in co-operation with the OSCE Centre in
Ashgabat.

In 2019, the OSCE Project Co-ordinator in Uzbekistan (PCUz) continued to support the host
country’s efforts to address transnational threats, promote transparency in governance, fight
corruption, combat money laundering and counteract trafficking in human beings and drugs.

COUNTERING TRANSNATIONAL THREATS
The PCUz continued activities in support of the fight against
terrorism, addressing P/C VERLT and the question of
returning ftfs, with a focus on women and youth.
The PCUz organized a national tabletop exercise on
countering the use of the Internet for terrorist purposes,
which was conducted in Tashkent. The exercise focused on
increasing national capacities to counter the development
and spread of online content for terrorist purposes by
enhancing international co-operation and sharing best
practices in engaging with private companies and other
non-state actors.
The exercise’s findings led to the development of a national
road map on how to address threats posed by the use
of the Internet for terrorist purposes. This road map is
expected to help policymakers in particular in formulating
human rights–compliant and gender-mainstreamed policies
and frameworks on preventing and countering online
content promoting violent extremism and terrorism.

STRENGTHENING ANTI-TRAFFICKING
EFFORTS
Throughout 2019, PCUz anti-trafficking efforts continued
to address new and emerging issues in counter-trafficking
by highlighting good practices and challenges. The PCUz
contributed to strengthening the capacities of actors at the
national and local levels through the provision of national
and local platforms. More than 110 investigators from all
regions of Uzbekistan acquired expert knowledge and
skills on new forms and methods of recruitment of potential
victims of human trafficking and explored the link between
human trafficking and related crimes such as terrorism
and money laundering. Particular attention was paid to the
gender aspects of human trafficking and the importance of
women in policing.
EMPOWERMENT OF WOMEN
The PCUz started co-operating with the newly created
Committee on Women and Gender Issues of the Senate
of the Oliy Majlis of the Republic of Uzbekistan with the
aim of enhancing women’s role in the political and social
affairs of the country. For example, a series of training
events and round-table discussions in various regions of
the country contributed to advancing the role of women
in political participation and provided comprehensive
support for businesswomen, especially in the context of
the development of family entrepreneurship and networking
activities. In addition, the PCUz aims to promote women’s
participation and women’s role in crime prevention and
to raise awareness of the different perspectives of law
enforcement and women’s organizations on how to deal
with these issues. In this regard, a series of round-table
discussions were launched in November and December
on the role of women in preventing crime within their
communities by elaborating on the concept of community
policing and the importance of civic-law enforcement
partnership in preventing criminal activities.

LEVERAGING
PARTNERSHIPS
Security in the OSCE area is inseparably linked to that of
neighbouring regions and can be strengthened through
dialogue and the sharing of commitments, resources and
expertise. The OSCE maintains privileged relations with
11 Asian and Mediterranean Partners for Co-operation
and continues to build on its extensive network of cooperative relationships with other international and regional
organizations.

Asian and
Mediterranean
Partners for
Co-operation

In 2019, the OSCE continued its political dialogue and shared experience
with its five Asian and six Mediterranean Partners for Co-operation.
To better reflect the growing co-operation between the OSCE and
its partners, the OSCE Ministerial Council in Bratislava renamed the
existing contact groups the Asian Partners for Co-operation Group and
the Mediterranean Partners for Co-operation Group, respectively.

ASIAN PARTNERS FOR CO-OPERATION

MEDITERRANEAN PARTNERS FOR CO-OPERATION

The OSCE participating States and the Asian Partners
continued to explore ways to further strengthen their cooperation by cultivating an open and interactive dialogue
both within the established meeting formats and beyond. The
rolling schedule of the Asian Contact Group featured several
innovative topics, such as the OSCE’s commitment to women,
peace and security; advancing the Partnership for sustainable
security; countering trafficking in human beings and modern
slavery; the current situation and ways forward on the Korean
Peninsula; and democratic institutions and the safety of
journalists in Afghanistan. The Asian Partners continued to
contribute to the OSCE’s dialogue and to provide significant
financial and human resources in support of OSCE activities.

2019 marked the 25th anniversary of the Mediterranean
Contact Group. This occasion provided the opportunity
not only for commemoration but also for Organization-wide
reflection about the future of the Mediterranean Partnership.
As the Chair of the Mediterranean Contact Group, Albania
promoted a forward-looking discussion, including through
a dedicated ambassadorial retreat that took place in Malta
in June. At the retreat and in other formats, a plurality of
participating States and Partners called for strengthening
the Mediterranean Partnership, including by revising the
Partnership tools in the direction of more action-oriented
dialogue. The Mediterranean Conference in Tirana, held on
24–25 October, provided a high-level political platform for
presenting ideas about the future of the Partnership. The
OSCE Secretary General, the OSCE Troika and a number of
delegations put forward specific proposals.

Throughout the year, the Secretary General and his team
participated in high-level events organized by Asian Partners,
as well as in several Asian Contact Group Meetings, and
held numerous high-level meetings with senior government
representatives from all five Asian Partner countries, as well
as various informal consultations aimed at exchanging best
practices in the area of promoting comprehensive security
across all three dimensions.
The 2019 OSCE Asian Conference in Tokyo was called “How
to Achieve Comprehensive Security in the Digital Era: The
Perspectives of the OSCE and Its Asian Partners”. In view of
the 25th anniversary of the OSCE Asian Partnership to be
celebrated in 2020, the conference was a unique opportunity
to exchange best practices in tackling complex transborder
threats and challenges, and in ensuring that technological
advances are harnessed for the benefit of all. The OSCE
Secretariat further supported South Korea in organizing
another interregional conference that focused on cyber/ICT
security in 2019.

Celebrations were supplemented with a rich programme of
political dialogue in 2019. Albania organized six meetings
of the Mediterranean Contact Group. To ensure continuity
with previous Chairs, key topics included youth, terrorism,
economic connectivity, interfaith dialogue, energy and
cybersecurity. The Partnership Fund supported a significant
number of co-operation projects in 2019, including training
in the human and economic and environmental dimensions
and a host of activities in the domain of transnational threats.
In November, ODIHR organized the first Young Policy
Advisers Course for OSCE Mediterranean Partners for
Co-operation in Florence. The course strengthened the
participants’ knowledge of democratic institutions and
OSCE commitments in the field of democratic governance,
facilitating a deeper understanding of the role of policy
advisers and the skills they need.

Co-operation with international
and regional organizations
2019 was a particularly important year for the OSCE’s dialogue and practical co-operation
with other international and regional organizations. It marked the 20th anniversary of
the OSCE Platform for Co-operative Security: a document designed to strengthen the
mutually reinforcing relationship between organizations and institutions concerned with
the promotion of security within the OSCE area. Adopted by the OSCE heads of state and
government at the 1999 Istanbul Summit, the Platform was a key milestone in the OSCE’s
efforts to develop a network of relations with partner organizations active in the politicomilitary field and in the human and economic dimensions of security. To celebrate this
anniversary, the Secretariat organized a side event on the margins of the OSCE Ministerial
Council held in Bratislava on 5–6 December.

Political dialogue
UNITED NATIONS (UN)
2019 marked a major step forward in
advancing the enduring partnership between
the UN and the OSCE. The Secretary General, the
Slovak Chairperson-in-Office of the OSCE and the United
Nations Secretary General endorsed a “Joint Statement
to Supplement the UN-OSCE Framework for Cooperation
and Coordination”. Through this document, the parties
committed to further enhancing their co-operation in
the maintenance of international peace and security and
the promotion of respect for human rights, fundamental
freedoms and the rule of law.
At the operational level, 2019 saw the successful
finalization of a joint action plan between the OSCE
Secretariat and the UN Office of Counter-Terrorism
(UNOCT). The action plan is aimed at implementing
joint activities in priority areas identified in the relevant
memorandum of understanding signed between the
parties the previous year.

The OSCE was the first regional organization to hold
consultations with the Chair of the recently established UN
Group of Governmental Experts on advancing responsible
state behaviour in cyberspace in the context of
international security in 2019. The consultations provided
the OSCE participating States with the opportunity
to express their expectations about the UN process
regarding cyber/ICT security, as well as to share examples
of best practices applied in the OSCE region.
COUNCIL OF EUROPE (COE)
Co-operation between the OSCE and the
CoE continued to develop successfully in the
four agreed areas of co-operation dedicated to the fight
against terrorism; combating human trafficking; protection
of the rights of persons belonging to national minorities,
particularly through the work of the High Commissioner on
National Minorities; and promotion of tolerance and nondiscrimination. Two annual meetings of the CoE–OSCE Co-

ordination Group once again proved to be an effective format
for sharing views on issues of mutual interest. As in 2018, the
OSCE Secretary General took the opportunity to personally
welcome the Group at its autumn meeting in Vienna and to
reiterate the relevance and impact of joint activities by the
OSCE and the CoE.
Regular communication between experts, day-to-day
informal dialogue and co-ordination of activities, including
in the field, continued to be the foundation of OSCE–CoE
interaction. Political contacts intensified thanks also to the
well-established practice of special briefings that share
the priorities of the respective Chairmanships. In 2019,
the OSCE Chairperson-in-Office personally presented
Slovakia’s priorities in Strasbourg. Both the Chairperson-inOffice and the Secretary General further participated in the
commemorative ceremony of the 70th anniversary of the
Council of Europe and the 129th session of the Committee of
Ministers of the Council of Europe in Helsinki. The Secretary
General also met with the new Secretary General of the
Council of Europe, Marija Pejčinović Burić, at the UN General
Assembly in New York and in Vienna on the occasion of
her first address to the Permanent Council. They discussed
issues of particular concern to both institutions and agreed
on a pragmatic approach to strengthening co-operation.
EUROPEAN UNION (EU)
In 2019, the OSCE and the EU carried out
a mid-term review of the implementation
of the exchange of letters signed in December 2018
with the European External Action Service and the
European Commission. During the reporting period,
both organizations further enhanced operational cooperation through the implementation of EU-funded
projects. Furthermore, the new EU Strategy on Central
Asia expressed political support for the role of the OSCE
in the region, reflecting a renewed consideration for the
Organization as a partner.

-----------------------Page 93 End-----------------------

Operational Co-operation
In 20 years of co-operation with international and regional organizations, the OSCE has
developed a large network of contacts and relations with organizations and institutions
active in the politico-military, economic and environmental, and human dimensions of
security. Today, most of the OSCE’s operational activities are carried out in collaboration
with partner organizations. The following are a few highlights of joint activities implemented
in 2019.
SUPPORTING THE SECURITY SECTOR
The OSCE has a long record of co-operation with other
international organizations in supporting the security sector
in OSCE participating States. This includes partnerships
to assist national efforts to reform security institutions
and strengthen good governance. In 2019, the CPC
continued to exchange experiences with UN agencies
and the European External Action Service about ways to
develop guidance and policy, leverage expertise across
organizations and undertake SSG/R assessments.
2019 also saw many capacity-building activities for law
enforcement officials that were implemented with the
support of other organizations. In the area of border
security and management, Frontex is one of the OSCE’s

key partners. In October, the OSCE signed a working
arrangement with Frontex, laying the ground for even closer
co-operation between the two organizations in the area of
border security.
UNODC is another important OSCE partner, including
in building capacities to counter cross-border crime. In
Kyrgyzstan, the Office in Bishkek and the UN agency
organized advanced train-the-trainers courses on the
detection of human beings, as well as explosive and
narcotic substances, for the canine officers of the State
Service for the Execution of Punishment, State Border
Service and the State Customs Service. In Albania, the
Presence works with UNODC to further international law
enforcement co-operation. In the area of crime prevention,

THE OSCE SCHOLARSHIP FOR PEACE AND SECURITY
The OSCE Scholarship for Peace and Security is a joint initiative of the OSCE and the United
Nations Office for Disarmament Affairs in Vienna (UNODA), in partnership with several organizations
whose work contributes to arms control, disarmament and non-proliferation. It supports the
implementation of UN Security Council resolutions on women, peace and security; youth; and
Sustainable Development Goal 5 on gender equality and Goal 17 on building partnerships.
In 2019, the OSCE granted 100 scholarships to young professionals from 52 OSCE participating States and
10 countries representing the OSCE Partners for Co-operation. They took part in the training programme
Conflict Prevention and Resolution through Arms Control, Disarmament and Non-proliferation in the OSCE
Area carried out from April to June 2019. In 2019, the training programme was awarded the OSCE Secretary
General Gender Award for being an outstanding initiative to support young women in the security sector.

the OSCE Mission to Serbia and UNODC joined forces in
organizing a regional “Line Up Live Up” train-the trainers
programme on the use of sports in youth crime prevention
and local training sessions on the prevention of drug abuse
among youth for more than 125 school police officers.
In Turkmenistan, the Centre in Ashgabat and the IOM
continued their co-operation in support of an advance
passenger information (API) system as required by the
International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). With
the latter, the OSCE concluded a memorandum of
understanding in November 2019 in favour of more
systematic co-operation in air transport facilitation and
border security. With IOM, the OSCE Mission to Bosnia
and Herzegovina organized capacity-building events for
law enforcement and the judiciary on the links between
migration and human trafficking, human trafficking and
information technologies, and criminal proceedings involving
migrants and refugees.
The OSCE’s diverse partners in supporting national security
sectors further includes INTERPOL, which worked with the
OSCE Mission to Montenegro to provide basic training for
law enforcement agencies on how they can best access
INTERPOL investigations to fight illicit trafficking of cultural
property. It also includes the Southeast European Law
Enforcement Center (SELEC), which joined forces with the
OSCE Mission to Skopje to organize a task force meeting
addressing trafficking in human beings and illegal migration.
COUNTERING THE THREATS OF CORRUPTION,
MONEY LAUNDERING AND TERRORISM
FINANCING
Several OSCE executive structures have joined forces with
other international organizations to assist participating
States in combating corruption, money laundering and the
financing of terrorism.
In South-Eastern Europe, OSCE field operations, the
Secretariat’s CPC and ODIHR have been co-operating
with the EU to assist authorities in the region in tackling
corruption and organized crime. The OSCE Mission to
Serbia also works with the EU to enhance the quality and
efficiency of the reporting of suspicious transactions and the
administration of core functions for the prevention of money
laundering.
Also, in the area of AML/CFT, the OSCE Programme
Office in Bishkek, the UN Office of Counter-Terrorism and
the Eurasian Group on Combating Money Laundering
and the Financing of Terrorism (EAG) organized the first
Eurasian Forum on Anti-Money Laundering and Combating
Financing of Terrorism. The event led to the creation of a
regular AML/CFT platform in Kyrgyzstan.
In Uzbekistan, the Project Co-ordinator works with the
OECD in an anti-corruption partnership, and partners with
the EAG in support of the country’s AML/CFT efforts in
trilateral co-operation with the UNODC. The Programme
Office in Dushanbe also collaborated with the UN’s
anti-crime agency to build the AML/CFT capacities of
representatives of law enforcement and banking authorities.
In Albania, UNODC, the OSCE Presence and the TNT
Department of the OSCE Secretariat have joined forces to
implement a multi-year training programme on countering
terrorist financing.

RAISING AWARENESS AMONG JUDICIAL
ACTORS: PAVING THE WAY FOR THE
2020 AGENDA ON PROSECUTION
Judges play a crucial role in upholding the rights of
victims of trafficking in human beings and in determining
the guilt and punishment of perpetrators. OSCE
Ministerial Council Decision No. 6/17 recognizes this
role and urges co-operation between the judiciary
and law enforcement. In this spirit, the Office of the
Special Representative and Co-ordinator for Combating
Trafficking in Human Beings, the Supreme Court of
Uzbekistan, the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation
(SCO) and the OSCE Project Co-ordinator in Uzbekistan,
in co-operation with other OSCE field operations,
organized an international conference for judges.
The conference gathered judges of the supreme or
cassation-level criminal courts from more than 20
OSCE participating States, countries representing
the OSCE Partners for Co-operation and SCO
member states to discuss the role of the judiciary
in combating trafficking in human beings.

PROMOTING DEMOCRATIC DEVELOPMENT
AND HUMAN RIGHTS
Specialized UN agencies, the Council of Europe and the EU
were the OSCE’s primary partners in support of activities in
the human dimension in 2019.
Among the UN agencies, UNDP partnered with the OSCE
Mission to Serbia in supporting the Women’s Parliamentary
Network and with the Programme Office in Bishkek
in opening the Civic Education Centre at the Central
Election Commission. The Centre is open to the public
and serves as a central place for receiving information on
electoral rights and processes, also in view of upcoming
parliamentary elections in 2020. In co-operation with the
Project Co-ordinator in Uzbekistan, the Office of the High
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) and UNDP
supported the enhancement of capacities of national
human rights institutions in 2019.
ODIHR worked closely with UN Women on creating the
new Gender and Security Toolkit. ODIHR also co-operated
closely with UNESCO to address anti-Semitism through
education, creating new curricula to help teachers to
prevent and respond to anti-Semitism.
The Programme Office in Dushanbe supported the
organization of the first penitentiary reform forum of
Tajikistan, which was co-organized by the Ministry of Justice
of Tajikistan, UNODC, OHCHR and the EU.
2019 saw a record number of more than 70 million people
fleeing war, persecution and conflict worldwide. In SouthEastern Europe, there are still over 300,000 people with
displacement-related needs. Within this context, the OSCE
remains particularly proud of its partnership with UNHCR
in support of the Regional Housing Programme (RHP). As
of 31 December 2019, almost 5,700 of the most vulnerable
displaced, refugee and returnee families had been assisted
by the RHP in a concrete manner, representing nearly half
of the total number of housing solutions the RHP is intended
to provide by its closure, currently foreseen for the end of
2021.

SAVING THE DNIESTER
The Dniester River is one of the largest transboundary rivers in Eastern Europe and a life-giving resource
for more than ten million people in Moldova and Ukraine. The OSCE, UNDP and the UNECE are supporting
a multi-year project entitled “Enabling transboundary co-operation and integrated water resources
management in the Dniester River Basin”, funded by the Global Environment Facility. A regular activity
of the project is the Summer Dniester School, which was held for the 12th time in July 2019. It provides
environmental education to young people and raises awareness for the river’s unique ecosystems.

With UNHCR, the OSCE also continued its work in the
area of statelessness. The third Practical OSCE–UNHCR
Seminar on Sharing Good Practices on Statelessness
among OSCE participating States was held in October
2019 and provided opportunities for experts at the
technical level to discuss obstacles and solutions to
childhood statelessness. Following North Macedonia’s
accession to the 1961 UN Convention on the Reduction of
Statelessness, the OSCE Mission to Skopje and UNHCR
worked with national authorities to implement international
standards concerning the protection of stateless persons,
including their right to nationality and access to citizenship.
Furthermore, ODIHR regularly partners with UNHCR on
Roma and Sinti issues.
The Council of Europe and the OSCE co-operated in
2019 in the areas of democratization and the protection
of human rights, including in Serbia, where the OSCE
Mission and the CoE built the capacities of lawyers to
protect fundamental human rights before national courts,
the Constitutional Court of Serbia and the European Court
of Human Rights. In Bosnia and Herzegovina, they helped
develop policies targeting Roma, and build capacities of
national minority councils to advocate for the improvement
of the legal framework governing national minority issues.
In Montenegro, the OSCE Mission and the CoE cooperated with the Ministry of Culture on a series of public
consultations to review proposed media legislation. In
Ukraine, the two organizations worked together to support
the country in strengthening its justice system, notably

94

through international human rights protection mechanisms.
ODIHR continued its close co-operation with the CoE and
its Venice Commission in the fields of legislative assistance,
democratic governance and the rule of law, finalizing
guidelines on freedom of peaceful assembly and releasing a
joint opinion on the legal framework for freedom of peaceful
assembly in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The EU and the OSCE partnered in several projects
in support of the OSCE’s human dimension, such as
promoting judicial independence, or implementing activities
in support of victims and witnesses of crime in Serbia.
In Bosnia and Herzegovina, both organizations work on
a number of joint initiatives, including the “War Crimes
Monitoring Project”, which is funded by the EU.
ODIHR also strengthened its co-operation with the EU in
2019, with projects focusing on supporting elections in
the Western Balkans and promoting human rights, gender
equality and the rule of law in Belarus. ODIHR also regularly
works with the European Commission against Racism and
Intolerance, the EU Agency for Fundamental Rights and the
OHCHR.
ODIHR continued its regular collaboration with
parliamentary delegations from the OSCE Parliamentary
Assembly, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council
of Europe and the European Parliament in joint election
observation missions.

OSCE–UNHCR COLLABORATION IN ADDRESSING DISPLACEMENT
In the last five years, the OSCE Conflict Prevention Centre and UNHCR have been working together to address
the protection needs of displaced persons. In 2014, they developed a joint publication called Protection Checklist:
Addressing Displacement and Protection of Displaced Populations and Affected Communities along the Conflict
Cycle, which was made available on the OSCE’s website in English and Russian. This is a reference tool for
OSCE field staff who work on, or might be confronted with, displacement issues. The two organizations also
provide training to OSCE staff to help them apply the checklist’s recommendations in practice. In 2019, they
held workshops for the OSCE Mission to Moldova and the OSCE Programme Office in Nur-Sultan on how to
address displacement in a collaborative approach. Moreover, in September, they organized an in-house round
table to discuss ways the protection checklist could better address the needs of OSCE field operations. These
discussions serve as a basis for the next workshops in 2020, when the topic of displacement is planned to be
discussed in a cross-cutting way with representatives of various OSCE field operations and UNHCR staff.

STRENGTHENING PARTNERSHIPS TO SUPPORT YOUTH ENGAGEMENT
The OSCEs’ South-Eastern European field operations have joined forces with the Regional Youth Co-operation
Office (RYCO) local branch offices to promote reconciliation and co-operation among youth in South-Eastern
Europe. Joint initiatives included a series of RYCO initiatives to provide tools and skills to enable youth engagement
and exchanges organized by the OSCE Mission to Montenegro and a Youth Trail to promote OSCE values among
youth co-organized by RYCO, the OSCE Presence in Albania and the Municipality of Tirana in May 2019.

THE 2019—2026 GENDER PARITY STRATEGY
Gender equality is a critical part of the OSCE
Secretary General’s Fit for Purpose reform
agenda and essential for the achievement of the
Organization’s goal. Gender parity- that is, the
equal representation of women and men, is an
important step towards achieving gender equality.
While the OSCE has managed to achieve overall
parity in recent years, women remain significantly
underrepresented in managerial and decision-making
roles. The 2019-2026 Gender Parity Strategy was
developed by the OSCE’s Department for Human
Resources to correct this gender imbalance at the
top of the Organization. It aims to reach parity across
all staff levels by 2026 and includes ambitious interim
targets, which will help the OSCE achieve this objective.
This includes the creation of an enabling, bias-free
work environment, the introduction of complementary
talent management measures, and improved leadership
and accountability for the attainment of results.
