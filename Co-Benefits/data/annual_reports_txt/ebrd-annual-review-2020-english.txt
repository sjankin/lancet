    About the EBRD             President’s
                               message	




About the EBRD

Established in 1991, the EBRD seeks to promote the
transition to a sustainable market economy and the
emergence of a strong private sector. It operates in
nearly 40 economies in Europe, Asia and Africa that are
committed to and applying the principles of multiparty
democracy, pluralism and market economics.
Through investment, policy reform and advisory projects, we work to make economies
more competitive, well-governed, green, inclusive, resilient and integrated. These are
the six transition qualities that guide our mission, which is also aligned with the UN
Sustainable Development Goals.

We invest in projects that bring economic, social or environmental benefits and would
not be funded solely by commercial banks. Our investments follow sound banking
principles, ensuring that the returns are commensurate with the risks, and take the
shape of debt, equity or guarantees. The Bank works mainly with private clients,
although it also finances public entities that deliver essential infrastructure and
services. Donors1 provide funding for advisory and technical assistance projects that
are crucial to the success of Bank investments.

The EBRD is owned by 69 shareholder governments, the European Union and the
European Investment Bank. It operates from headquarters in London and a network
of Resident Offices.

    	Annual Bank Investment (ABI) is the volume of commitments made by the Bank during the year. This includes: (i) new commitments (less any amount cancelled or
     syndicated within the year); (ii) restructured commitments; and (iii) amounts issued under the Trade Facilitation Programme (TFP) during the year and outstanding at
     year-end.
5
    	Annual mobilised investment is the volume of commitments from entities others than the EBRD made available to the client due to the Bank’s direct involvement.
6
    	Total project value is the total amount of finance provided to a project, including both EBRD and non-EBRD finance, and is reported in the year in which the project first
