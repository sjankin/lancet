         ECONOMIC COMMUNITY
         A    fter a very difficult 2020, the region’s economy is taking tentative steps
              toward recovery. Growth was estimated at 3.3% in 2020, bringing the
         region’s GDP to USD 3.0 trillion, down from USD 3.2 trillion in 2019. Preliminary
         ASEAN statistics indicate that total merchandise trade declined by 5.5% in 2020
         year-on-year (yoy) to US$ 2.7 trillion, while foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows
         were significantly affected, dropping 24.6% yoy to USD137.2 billion. While the
         recovery outlook is positive, it remains uncertain and will depend on vaccination
         and containment success, as well as continued macroeconomic and political
         stability. Several risks remain, including an uneven or differentiated recovery,
         continued trade and technology competition, and concerns over debt and fiscal
         sustainability. Despite these challenges, the ASEAN Economic Community
         (AEC) is embarking on the second five-year phase of the AEC Blueprint 2025,
         determined to work for a sustainable recovery and to develop long-term resilience.

            CONNECTIVITY

            W     ork to enhance ASEAN Connectivity has proceeded from strength
                  to strength, both inside and outside the region, during the reporting
            period. Connectivity has been the linchpin for ASEAN, as it pursues
            development and supports the COVID-19 recovery.

            Via its Master Plan on ASEAN Connectivity (MPAC) 2025, ASEAN has been
            addressing the pandemic’s short-term impact while building long-term
            resilience and improving preparedness for future crises. As of May 2021,
            13 of the Master Plan’s 15 initiatives have been implemented to enhance
            regional connectivity and benefit ASEAN’s peoples. The ASEAN Connectivity
            Coordinating Committee (ACCC), National Coordinators, National Focal
            Points, Lead Implementing Bodies, and relevant ASEAN Sectoral Bodies will
            continue to work with their partners to deliver MPAC 2025.
