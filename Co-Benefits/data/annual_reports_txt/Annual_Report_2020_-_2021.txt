EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The Secretariat realised an implementation rate of 85% of planned activities, and 58% utilization
rate for 2020/21 budget. The high implementation rate compared to the low utilization rate was a
result of a swift move to virtual operations so as to ensure a safe working environment and
business continuity under challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. It is also worth noting
that, the achieved 85% implementation rate was the highest rate recorded since 2016/17. In
2016/17 implementation rate was 80%, in 2017/18 was 82%, in 2018/19 was 80%, and in 2019/20
was 79%.
Overall, the impact of COVID-19 pandemic continued to impede the implementation of regional
and national interventions across the Secretariat and the SADC Member States at large during
the 2020/21 Financial Year. The lingering impact of the Pandemic impacted the political,
economic, financial, social, and environmental dimensions with devastating effect on the lives and
wellbeing of the people in the region, as evident from the significant loss of lives; loss of jobs and
unemployment; political instability; and escalated income inequality. Notwithstanding the
challenges, the Region remained vigilant and committed towards the attainment of the objectives
as enshrined in the priority areas of the Regional Indicative Strategic Development Plan (RISDP)
and indeed the SADC Vision.
This report outlines the regional achievement and provides an account on the implementation of
planned activities, challenges and mitigation measures, as presented below:

Regional Peace and Security
SADC remained engaged and seized with Peace and Security initiatives in the Region in 2020/21
Financial Year. The political and security situation in Lesotho remained generally stable after the
successful conduct of the National Stakeholders Dialogue in 2020. This process, among others,
enabled the establishment of the National Reforms Authority (NRA), whose objective is to
spearhead the pending comprehensive national constitutional, parliamentary, security and public
sector reforms.
The Region was instrumental in stabilization of the operations in the Democratic Republic of
Congo (DRC) and efforts to combat terrorism and violent extremism in the Northern Mozambique
and Eastern DRC. The Region has finalized arrangements for the deployment of the Force
Intervention Brigade (FIB) operating under the United Nations Organization Mission in Democratic
Republic of the Congo (MONUCO) mandate, which, among others enables the neutralization of
negative forces, protection of civilians and facilitating the provision of humanitarian assistance to
the population affected by the acts of negative forces as well as terrorism and violent extremism.
The Region also remained seized with security situation in the Province of Cabo Delgado in the
Republic of Mozambique, specifically threat posed by acts of terrorism and violent extremism
perpetrated terrorists who have destabilized the country since October 2017. A number of
meetings were held to deliberate on the security situation in Mozambique, which resulted in an
approval a regional response of deploying a SADC Stand force to support the republic of
Government of Mozambique in combating the threat of terrorism and violent extremism.
The Region continued to implement SADC Principles and Guidelines Governing Democratic
Elections to ensure free and fair elections across the region. To this effect, a Five-Year Funding
Mechanism (2021-2025) for the Deployment of the SADC Electoral Observation Missions
(SEOMs) using own resources was developed and approved. Taking into account challenges
7

-----------------------Page 7 End-----------------------

posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, pre, during, and post-virtual consultations with electoral
stakeholders were conducted in the three Member States that held elections in 2020, namely the
Republics of Malawi and Seychelles and the United Republic of Tanzania. Work to develop
guidelines for monitoring elections during pandemics also commenced.
A peace and security threats assessment was also undertaken. A report that outlined the
identified threats, and recommended measures was approved during the year. To this effect an
action plan to implement the recommended measures will be developed and implementation will
be mainstreamed in plans and budgets as of 2021/22.
Lastly, the Mechanism to honour the Founders of SADC was also concluded and approved.

Economic Developments
At Global level, the COVID-19 pandemic triggered the deepest global recession since World War
II. In a bid to save lives and contain the spread of the virus, economies were pushed in “Great
Lockdowns” which triggered the worst recession since the Great Depression. Notable adverse
effects of COVID-19 pandemic include: economic lockdowns, direct disruption to global supply
chains, weaker final demand for imported goods and services and the wider regional declines in
international tourism and business travel. Resultantly, the world economy contracted by 3.3
percent in 2020, an outcome far worse than during the 2009 Global Financial Crisis.
At Regional level, the latest statistics indicate that Member States underperformed in achieving
the agreed macroeconomic convergence indicators. In terms of Gross Domestic Product (GDP),
preliminary data indicates that SADC regional GDP growth contracted by 4.7 percent in 2020. All
Member States recorded contractions in real GDP growth in 2020 except for Malawi and the
United Republic of Tanzania who recorded minimal growth rates not exceeding 5.5 per cent.
Furthermore, the Region annual inflation increased to an average of 50 percent in 2020 from 16.4
percent in 2019, largely due to heightened inflationary pressures in Zimbabwe. The average
inflation excluding Zimbabwe averaged 6.8 percent in 2020. Annual inflation rate in the SADC
region is projected to ease a bit to 15.4 percent in 2021. Furthermore, public debt continued to
trend upward and it has breached the regional threshold of 60 per cent of GDP due to weakening
fiscal positions in 2020. Public debt increased from 55.5 per cent of GDP in 2019 to 63.2 per cent
of GDP in 2020. The increasing public debt levels will put additional burden to Member States’
resources as debt service costs increase. Debt burden is expected to worsen for SADC Member
States with public debt forecasted to further increase to 69 per cent of GDP in 2021.
The Regional Outlook for 2021/22 is forecasted to grow by 2 percent in 2021 and 3.2 percent in
2022. The forecasted economic recovery in 2021 and beyond largely hinged measures put in
place to contain the spread of COVID-19 and mitigate its socio-economic impacts, which include
the enhancement of national and regional capacities in producing medicines, medical supplies,
and developing vaccines, and harnessing digital technology across sectors.
Annual inflation rate in the Region is projected to ease a bit to 15.4 percent in 2021. Zimbabwe’s
inflation is expected to decline significantly to 134.8 per cent in 2021 from 654.9 per cent in 2020.
Overall, Member States are projected to underperform in achieving the agreed macroeconomic
convergence indicators in 2021. Bottlenecks, such as, limited resources; and emergences of more
contagious strains of the COVID-19 Pandemic, may also undermine economic recovery and
ultimately dampen the growth prospects for the Region, as such the region is to remain alert and
vigilant.

Industrialization and Infrastructure Support for Regional Integration
Industrialization remains the effective means of achieving the main goals of the SADC, namely
increased economic productivity, stronger Regional Integration and reduced poverty for people
living in the region through the generation of goods and services. During the year, and following
approval of the SADC Protocol on Industry by the 39th SADC Summit in August 2019, twelve (12)
Member States have signed the Protocol. Member States that are yet to sign are Democratic
Republic of Congo, Republic of South Africa and Republic of Zambia. It should, nonetheless, be
noted that whereas, thirteen (13) Member States have signed the Protocol, it is only the Republic
of Seychelles that has submitted the instruments of ratification.
As part of implementing the SADC Industrialization Strategy, profiling of four (4) Value Chains in
the Agriculture sector (soya beans, wheat, cotton and rice) and eight (8) Aquaculture-specific
Value Chains (tilapia, salmonid, abalone, crustaceans, bivalve, marine finfish and pearl) was
concluded in 2020, and implementation is ongoing. In addition, a Regional Framework for Supplier
Development with the special focus on building capacities and capabilities of Small to Medium
(SMEs) to contribute to industrialisation was concluded for implementation at national level.
A Regional Gaps Analysis and developed a Regional Programme as part of regional measures
to improve Industrial Competitiveness of SADC Member States was also concluded. The
programme aims to ensure that all SADC Member States strive to achieve the same goals of
industrialization and eliminate chances of contradictory policy instruments that might work against
the SADC industrialization objectives.
Infrastructure remains a key enabler to SADC industrialization and regional integration at large.
As a contribution towards the availability and universal access to sufficient, integrated, efficient,
and cost effective infrastructure systems, as well as the provision of sustainable services; a total
of 13 small sub-grant Groundwater infrastructure projects were implemented in Botswana (3
projects of which 2 were legacy projects from a predecessor groundwater programme); Zimbabwe
(3 projects of which (two) 2 were legacy projects); Eswatini, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique,
Namibia, Tanzania and Zambia. The pilot projects reached 84,000 direct beneficiaries especially
in small rural communities and villages whose water security for domestic and livelihood activities
was greatly improved. Also through this pilot projects component, an estimated 200 people were
trained on aspects to enhance their skills for infrastructure planning, construction as well as
operation and maintenance.
Under the Energy Sector, an effort to expand electricity generation and transmission capacity, the
Region commissioned 2,400 MW in 2020 contributed against the targeted capacity of 3,215 MW.
This was mainly due to the COVID-19 restrictions of movement and reduced operations hours
which affected power generation and transmission projects in the Region. In addition, the Draft
Agreement amending the Protocol on Energy of 1996 was approved in October 2020.
The SADC Project Preparation Development Facility (SADC - PPDF) continued to support
Member States to strengthen regional infrastructure connectivity by providing grants for project
preparation and development for cross-border regional infrastructure projects in energy,
transport, ICT and trans-boundary water. As at end of December 2020, PPDF had committed a
total of US $ 20.2 million (after savings and cancellation) for the preparation of ten (10) regional
projects covering energy, transport and water sectors. Notable progress was registered on seven
(7) projects whose feasibility studies have been concluded, namely: Mulembo Lelya Hydro
Electric Power (DRC and Zambia); Angola-Namibia Transmission Interconnector (Angola and
Namibia); Second Alaska – Sherwood 400 kV Line (Zimbabwe); Kasomeno-Mwenda Toll Road
9

-----------------------Page 9 End-----------------------

(DRC and Zambia); Kazungula Water Supply and Sanitation (Zambia and Botswana); and
Lomahasha/Namaacha Cross Border Water Supply Project (Eswatini and Mozambique).
Interventions under Information Communication and Technology played a critical role in adapting
and remaining resilient through the COVID-19 pandemic. These included the deployment of the
Internet Exchange Points (IXPs) which aims to reduce transit costs, improve throughput, reduce
latency and provide better quality of service; implementation of the SADC Roaming Project which
aims to promote competition in the Region; the Harmonization of Cyber Security Legal and
Regulatory Framework and the SADC Preparations of World Radio Communications Conference
to review the Radio Regulations; and the Digital Terrestrial Television (DTT) Migration to enables
better television quality pictures and sound.
In the area of Transport, the Secretariat continued to coordinate and manage the Tripartite
Transport and Transit Facilitation Programme (TTTFP) which aims to provide harmonised legal,
regulatory and system framework for Member/Partner States to implement the harmonized
minimum standards in cross border road transportation under the Multilateral Cross Border Road
Transport Agreement (MCBRTA) and Vehicle Load Management Agreement (VLMA). Five (5)
sets of Model Laws & Regulations were developed to facilitate the domestication of the VLMA
and MCBRTA for Vehicle Load Management, Cross Border Road Transport, Road Traffic, Road
Traffic & Transport Transgressions and the Transport of Dangerous Goods by Road. Regional
Guidelines and Standard Operating Procedures were also developed for Movement of Goods and
Services during COVID-19.

Trade, Finance and Investment
Trade remains fundamental to the economic development of a region, with broader benefits to
Regional Integration. Intra-SADC trade, however remains significantly low, at around 19%
compared to other regions such as Asia (30 per cent) and EU (60 per cent).
To enhance intra and extra-SADC trade through market integration, trade facilitation and customs
cooperation, the E-Certificate of Origin Framework was developed during 2020/21 to facilitate the
application Certificate of Origin electronically, thus easing cross border trade. The Framework will
be piloted in six Member States (Botswana, Eswatini, Malawi, Namibia, Tanzania and Zambia).
The SADC Simplified Trade Regime Framework and SADC Regional Customs Transit Guarantee
Regulations were finalized. The main aim of the Framework is to facilitate intra and extra SADC
Trade.
The first round of negotiations on services was completed in six (6) priority sectors namely,
communication, finance, tourism and transport services, construction and energy-related
services.
In relation to the COMESA-EAC-SADC Tripartite Free Trade Area Agreement (TFTA), Eswatini
and Zambia ratified the Tripartite Free Trade Area Agreement (TFTA) during the year, thereby
joining Egypt, Kenya, South Africa, Rwanda, Burundi, Uganda, Botswana and Namibia. Four (4)
additional ratifications are required to reach the needed 14 ratifications to bring the TFTA into
force. The African Continental Free Trade Agreement (AfCFTA) entered into force on 30 May
2019, and from SADC, Angola, Eswatini, DRC, Lesotho, Namibia, Mauritius, Malawi, South Africa,
Zambia and Zimbabwe ratified the AfCFTA Agreement.
In terms of the finance and investment in the Region, a total of 82 participating Banks, from the
fifteen (15) SADC Member States (except Comoros), were electronically linked to effect crossborder payments and settlements in real time. From August 2019 to June 2021 an additional
10

-----------------------Page 10 End-----------------------

641.832 transactions were settled representing ZAR 2.32 Trillion equivalent of USD 162.15 billion.
Cumulatively, from July 2013 to June 2021, total number of transactions settled reached
2,170,372, representing ZAR 8.46 Trillion equivalent of USD 591.38 billion. In addition, the Region
implementation the Mobile Initiated Low Value Credit Transfers Cleared on an Immediate Basis
(TCIB) which aims at creating an efficient, safe, harmonised and integrated payments system in
the region, to further reduce cross-border remittance costs across SADC region as well as to
enhance financial inclusion. In the area of financial inclusion, 68% of adults in the Region are
financially included against the target of 75% by 2021. In terms of gender split, 67% of female
adults are financially included while the rate is 70% for male. The SADC Financial Inclusion Subcommittee was operationalised in 2020/21.

Social and Human Development in the Region
In the Employment and Labour Sector, the SADC Employment and Labour Policy Framework
covering 2021-2030 was developed and approved in April 2021. The Framework aims at
addressing challenges relating to economic growth and employment creation in the Region. The
SADC Youth Empowerment Policy Framework that aims to facilitate realization of the
demographic dividend in SADC was also developed and approved by the SADC Committee of
Ministers responsibly for Youth in 2021.

Food Agriculture and Natural Resources in the Region
In order to realize improved agricultural production, productivity and competitiveness, the region
approved an additional 24 crop varieties eligible to be produced and traded throughout the region.
These include maize, wheat, beans, groundnuts, sorghum and soya beans. Further to that, three
(3) Regional Strategies for management of fruit flies, tomato leaf minor and fall armyworm were
produced and the strategies were approved during the period under review. Also, the Regional
Strategy for Animal Genetics Conservation and utilization and implementation mechanisms, as
well as a regional framework for Antimicrobial Resistance control to address the rise of
antimicrobial resistant organisms were developed and approved.
Considering Market access for agricultural products (crops, livestock and natural resources); the
Regional Agriculture Information Management System (AIMS) strategy was developed and
validated. AIMS is key to increase agriculture production, productivity and competitiveness, and
equally is key for increased market access and trade of agriculture products.
The vulnerability Assessments and Analysis Guidelines for Assessments in the context of COVID19 Pandemic were developed. Thirteen (13) Member States (excluding Comoros, Mauritius and
Seychelles) conducted their 2020 annual vulnerability assessments. In addition, a significant
progress has been achieved towards development of functional early warning system across the
Member States. By end of December 2020, ten (10) Member States (Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi,
Mauritius, Namibia, Seychelles, Republic of South Africa, United Republic of Tanzania, Zambia
and Zimbabwe) had functional Early Warning Systems. The support to Member States to align
their Food and Nutrition Security Strategy (FNSS) to the Regional FNSS was also successfully
completed in January 2021.
The crucial instruments for the implementation of the Protocol on Forestry were successfully
produced and validated by Member States for sustainable management of natural resources
(fisheries, forestry and wildlife). A Regional Financing facility for SADC Transfrontier Conservation
Areas was established during 2020/2, following its approval by Council of Ministers in 2018. Draft
SADC Regional Fisheries Monitoring control and surveillance (MCS) strategy was also developed
11

-----------------------Page 11 End-----------------------

and approved. The Strategy is expected to ensure compliance and enforcement, and such
sustainable management of fisheries.
In order to maximize protection of sea and water borne resources, the SADC Integrated Maritime
Strategy was revised. The Strategy aims at coordinating Member States efforts in protecting
against illegal and unregulated fishing, prevent transnational organized crime and syndicates to
engage in illicit activities such as traffic of arms, drugs, human beings and endangered sea
species. The Strategy also seeks to potentiate the development of the blue economy by providing
a conducive environment for the sustainable exploration of the marine and riverine local based
economies.
The National aquaculture strategies, policy briefs, factsheets and success stories were developed
for three (3) Member namely Botswana, Malawi and Namibia. A number of instruments and
mechanisms for disaster preparedness and response mechanism were also developed and
approved.

Strategic Review and Policy Development
With the expiration of both the revised RISDP 2015-2020, and SIPO, the Vision 2050, and a
successor SADC Regional Indicative Strategic Development Plan (RISDP) 2020-2030, were
approved in August 2020. The SADC RISDP 2020-30 is a coherent and comprehensive
framework for the implementation of SADC’s regional integration agenda for the next ten (10)
years. To operationalize RISDP 2020-30, SADC Policy on Strategic Development, Planning,
Monitoring, Evaluation and Reporting (SPMER) was developed during the year. The objective of
SPMER is to strengthen and demonstrate SADC commitment towards evidence-based decisionmaking; priority setting; strategy development; planning, monitoring, evaluation and reporting, as
well as, using results to enhance performance and impact of, amongst others, the RISDP 202030.

INTRODUCTION

This Report presents progress made by the SADC Secretariat in collaboration with the Member
States and other stakeholders in implementing the SADC regional cooperation and integration
programmes during the 2020/21 fiscal year, guided by the RISDP and SIPO.

Since the aim of SADC is to create a Community providing for regional peace and security, and
an integrated regional economy. As a regional institution it has laid the basis on which regional
planning and development in southern Africa could be pursued through the SADC Secretariat as
the Principal Executive Institution of SADC, responsible for strategic planning, facilitation and
coordination and management of all SADC Programmes. As headed by the Executive Secretary
based in Gaborone, Botswana, SADC Secretariat structure is designed to maximize and support
the facilitation of the Member States policies and programmes to best contribute to the overall
objectives of SADC – achieving Regional Integration and Poverty Alleviation.
Guided by a Vision, Mission and Mandate, the SADC Secretariat performs the function of strategic
planning and management of the programmes of SADC through sectoral and administrative roles
organized into three major groups of Directorates and Units, each under the responsibility of a
member of the SADC Executive. Specialised SADC Centres such as RPTC based in Zimbabwe,
address important activities, such as poverty and regional peace keeping, while some of the
Directorates supply a range of the thematic services.
The Institutional arrangement of the SADC is divided into Priority Intervention Areas which are
basically key priority areas of work for the SADC Secretariat and these are;
•
•
•
•
•
•

Peace and Security
Trade, Industry, Finance and Investment
Infrastructure and Services
Food, Agriculture and Natural Resources
Social and Human Development
Cross-cutting issues of Gender and Development; Science and Technology;
Information and Communications Technologies; and Environment and Sustainable
Development.

This report therefore focuses particularly on the major achievements, considering the challenges
encountered as well as mitigation measures provided in the implementation of planned activities
during the Fiscal Year 2020/21. In actual fact, the said achievements would have been derived in
line with the planned outputs of the Corporate Plan of 2020/21 as approved by Council in August
2019. In particular, the report flags out the major SADC economic, social and political
achievements in the region as at the end of 2020/21 Financial year looking at the above priority
areas of intervention as captured in the Executive Summary above, and as detailed below in the
Report.

POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS IN THE REGION
Political Development

Conflict Prevention, Management and Resolution
SADC continued to support interventions aimed at deepening the region’s capacity to prevent and
manage conflicts, through different means. The political and security situation in Lesotho
remained generally stable during the period under review after the successful conduct of the
National Stakeholders Dialogue in 2020. This process, among others, enabled the establishment
of the National Reforms Authority (NRA), whose objective is to spearhead the pending
comprehensive national constitutional, parliamentary, security and public sector reforms, a
process which is supported by SADC thorough the Facilitation Team to the Kingdom of Lesotho.
Furthermore, three studies were conducted, namely the Mechanism for the inclusion of trained
experts and practitioners in SADC Mediation efforts; the Assessment of Progress and Challenges
in implementing the Regional Strategy on Women, Peace and Security (UNSCR 1325) at
Regional and National levels; and the Mapping of Regional and National Infrastructures for Peace
(I4P). These sets of interventions were aimed at creating a pool of capacity at subnational level
to facilitate conflict prevention and mediation efforts.
Similarly, focus was also geared towards revitalizing the established structures for conflict
prevention, preventive diplomacy and mediation through the filling in on new members of the
current Panel of Elders (PoE) and the Mediation Reference Group (MRG) which tenure has ended
in 2020.
Strengthening Regional Collective Defense and Security
SADC has remained engaged and seized with Peace and Security initiatives in the region,
including stabilization operations in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and efforts to
combat terrorism and violent extremism in the Northern Mozambique and Eastern DRC.
In the DRC, the Region has finalized arrangements for the deployment of the Force Intervention
Brigade (FIB) operating under the United Nations Organization Mission in Democratic Republic
of the Congo (MONUCO) mandate, which, among others enables the neutralization of negative
forces, protection of civilians and facilitating the provision of humanitarian assistance to the
population affected by the acts of negative forces as well as terrorism and violent extremism. In
collaboration with the United Nations (UN), SADC has facilitated the implementation of the
reconfiguration of the FIB.
In implementing the reconfiguration process the FIB Troop Contributing Countries from the region,
notably the Republics of Malawi, South Africa and the United Republic of Tanzania have been
able to make steady progress on the rotation of troops as well as the deployment of key enablers
(equipment and combat warfare), as well as FIB Headquarter Staff Officers. As part of the
implementation plan, the Quick Reaction Forces (QRF) deployment is ongoing and expected to
be fully operational in July 2021.
SADC is also facilitating the implementation of the Joint Strategy on the Progressive and Phased
Drawdown of MONUSCO in the DRC, as endorsed by the adoption of UN Security Council
14

-----------------------Page 14 End-----------------------

Resolution 2556 of 18 December 2020. The Joint Strategy on the Progressive and Phased
Drawdown of MONUSCO identifies priorities by the Government of DRC and MONUSCO within
the strategy being, among others, constitution of Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration
(DDR) programs, institution of disciplinary and judicial procedures, development of security sector
reform (SSR) plan, development of a comprehensive stabilization and conflict prevention strategy
for Eastern DRC with a view towards transition, as well as conducting information-sharing with
regional security forces to interdict cross-border flows of arms, combatants and conflict minerals.
The Region also remained seized with security situation in the Province of Cabo Delgado in the
Republic of Mozambique, specifically threat posed by acts of terrorism and violent extremism
perpetrated terrorists who have destabilized the country since October 2017. A number of
meetings were held to deliberate on the security situation in Mozambique, that resulted in an
approval a regional response of deploying a SADC Standby force to support the Government of
republic of Mozambique in combating the threat of terrorism and violent extremism.
The SADC Integrated Maritime Strategy was revised to maximize protection of sea and water
borne resources. The Strategy aims at coordinating Member States efforts in protecting against
illegal and unregulated fishing, prevent transnational organized crime and syndicates to engage
in illicit activities such as traffic of arms, drugs, human beings and endangered sea species. The
Strategy also seeks to potentiate the development of the blue economy by providing a conducive
environment for the sustainable exploration of the marine and riverine local based economies.
Regional Logistic Depot
Despite the challenges imposed by the COVID 19 restrictions, Phase II of the project of the
construction of the Regional Logistics Depot has progressed well with the initiation of the
schematics design of the structure. The Depot once completed and operational, will facilitate the
storage of materials, equipment and end user stocks in readiness to be used by SADC Standby
Force to conduct mandated multidimensional, complex, humanitarian assistance interventions
and peace support operations (PSO’s).
Consolidating Democratic Institutions in the Region
SADC supports the consolidation of democracy in its Member States, mainly through the
deployment of the SADC Electoral Observation Mission (SEOM) which is advised by the SADC
Electoral Advisory Council (SEAC). The main purpose of the deployment of the SEOM is to
assess Member States adherence to the SADC Principles and Guidelines Governing Democratic
Elections (the Guidelines). The SEAC is leading the process of ensuring that Member States are
assisted in implementing the outcomes of the various SEOMs, and the SEAC provides such
assistance through follow-up post-election reviews, of which six are planned between 2021-2022.
In 2020, SADC Member States reaffirmed their commitment for the consolidation of democracy
by approving a Five-Year Funding Mechanism (2021-2025) for the Deployment of the SEOMs.
The mechanism will be funded through Member States contributions in order to enhance
ownership of the electoral processes.
Region continued to implement SADC Principles and Guidelines Governing Democratic Elections
to ensure free and fair elections across the region. To this effect a Five-Year Funding Mechanism
(2021-2025) for the Deployment of the SADC Electoral Observation Missions (SEOMs) using own
resources was developed and approved. Taking into challenged posed by the COVID-19
pandemic, pre, during, and post-virtual consultations with electoral stakeholders were conducted
15

-----------------------Page 15 End-----------------------

in the three Member States that held elections in 2020, namely the Republics of Malawi and
Seychelles and the United Republic of Tanzania. Work to develop guidelines for monitoring
elections during pandemics also commenced.
These experiences also formed the basis for the development of the Draft SADC Guidelines for
Election Observation under Public Health Emergencies (2020), which the MCO endorsed in June
2021 following the extensive Member State consultations and input as obtained in 2020.
A peace and security threats assessment was also undertaken, a report that outlined the identified
threat, and recommended measures to address the identified threats was approved during the
year. To this effect an action plan to implement the recommended measures will be developed
and implementation will be mainstreamed in plans and budgets as of 2021/22.
Lastly, the Mechanism to honour the Founders of SADC was also concluded and approved.

Economic Development

Global Economic Developments for 2020 and Outlook
The latest World Economic Outlook released by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in April
2021 envisages a brighter economic outlook largely due to a stronger-than-anticipated economic
recovery across regions. The strong economic recovery results from additional fiscal support in a
few large economies; the anticipated vaccine-powered recovery in the second half of 2021; and
continued adaptation of economic activity to subdued mobility. The IMF is projecting a global
economic growth of 6 percent in 2021 (0.5 percentage point upgrade from the January 2021
projection) and 4.4 percent in 2022 (0.2 percentage point upgrade), from an estimated historic
contraction of -3.3 percent in 2020. The revision in global prospects for growth in 2021 and 2022
is a result of sizeable growth upgrade of the United States, from 1.3 percentage points growth at
6.4 percent this year. Further, a rebound is expected to a majority of advanced economies,
including the euro area in 2021. China is projected to grow at 8.4 percent in 2021. While there are
signs that China’s economy had already returned to pre-pandemic GDP, many other countries
may revert to their pre-COVID path in 2023.
The COVID-19 pandemic triggered the deepest global recession since World War II. In a bid to
save lives and contain the spread of the virus, economies were pushed in “Great Lockdowns”
which triggered the worst recession since the Great Depression. Notable adverse effects of
COVID-19 pandemic include: economic lockdowns, direct disruption to global supply chains,
weaker final demand for imported goods and services, and the wider regional declines in
international tourism and business travel. Resultantly, the world economy contracted by 3.3
percent in 2020, an outcome far worse than during the 2009 Global Financial Crisis.
The pandemic induced economic downturn was more severe in advance economies, tourism and
commodity exports driven economies as well as in economies with limited policy space to
respond. According to the IMF's World Economic Outlook for April 2021, the US and Euro Area
are estimated to have contracted by 3.5 percent and 6.6 percent in 2020, respectively. The
emerging and developing markets were not spared. With the exception of China which recorded
a growth of 2.3 percent, a marginal performance relative to its performance in previous years,
other countries in this category experienced contractions, the most prominent of all being India
with an economic contraction of 8.0 percent. Economic growth in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA)
contracted by 1.9 percent, with the two largest economies in the region, namely: Nigeria and
16

-----------------------Page 16 End-----------------------

South Africa, experiencing significant economic downturn. Table 1 shows selected IMF estimated
growth for 2020 and projections for 2021 and 2022.

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) envisages a brighter economic outlook underpinned by
stronger-than-anticipated economic recovery across regions. The IMF is projecting a global
economic growth of 6 percent in 2021 (0.5 percentage point upgrade from the January 2021
projection) and 4.4 percent in 2022 (0.2 percentage point upgrade), from an estimated historic
contraction of -3.3 percent in 2020.
The upgrades in global growth for 2021 and 2022 mainly result from upgrades for advanced
economies, particularly to a sizeable upgrade for the United States (1.3 percentage points) that
is expected to grow at 6.4 percent this year. This makes the United States the only large economy
projected to surpass the level of GDP it forecasted to have in 2022 in the absence of this
pandemic. Other advanced economies, including the euro area, will also rebound this year but at
a slower pace. Among emerging markets and developing economies, China is projected to grow
this year at 8.4 percent.
Regional Economic Performance for 2020
In the SADC region, the latest statistics indicate that Member States underperformed in achieving
the agreed macroeconomic convergence indicators.
Real GDP
Preliminary data indicates SADC regional GDP growth contracted by 4.7 percent in 2020. All
Member States recorded contractions in real GDP growth in 2020 except for Malawi and the
United Republic of Tanzania who recorded minimal growth rates not exceeding 5.5 per cent. Only
two Member States (Lesotho and the United Republic of Tanzania) met the set targets of the
Primary Macroeconomic Economic Convergence indicators in 2020.
17

-----------------------Page 17 End-----------------------

Inflation
SADC region annual inflation increased to an average of 50 percent in 2020 from 16.4 percent in
2019, largely due to heightened inflationary pressures in Zimbabwe. The average inflation
excluding Zimbabwe averaged 6.8 percent in 2020. All Member States except Angola, DRC,
Madagascar, Malawi, Zambia and Zimbabwe, met the regional inflation target of 3-7 percent
range. Annual inflation rate in the SADC region is projected to ease a bit to 15.4 percent in 2021.
Zimbabwe’s inflation is expected to decelerate significantly to 134.8 per cent in 2021 from 654.9
per cent in 2020. Inflation is expected to increase above the regional benchmark for Angola, DRC,
Malawi, Zambia and Zimbabwe.
National Savings and Investment
According to the International Monetary Fund, World Economic Outlook Database, April 2021,
annual total investments and gross national savings will remain subdued in 2020, below the
regional target of 30 per cent of GDP. The region recorded total investments of 20.32% per cent
in 2020 from 22% in 2019. Four Member States remained recording investments above the
regional target: Mozambique (66.6%), Botswana (36%), Zambia (34.5%) and Tanzania (34.4%).
On the savings side, gross national savings will remain below 20% of GDP. The region recorded
gross national savings of 16% per cent in 2020 from 19.2% in 2019. Only Tanzania will record
gross national savings (33.2%) above the regional target.
Fiscal Sector
The global economic developments, weak commodity prices, adverse weather conditions and the
impact of COVID-19 weighed down the regional economy in the second and third quarter of 2020,
and these had varying negative impacts on the fiscal positions of Member States. Fiscal deficit
increased from 3.3 per cent of GDP in 2019 to 6.8 per cent of GDP in 2020. Only Angola, DRC,
Lesotho and Tanzania achieved the regional fiscal deficit target of 3 per cent of GDP in 2020.
This is a result of synchronised increases in government expenditure to support the recovery from
the impact of COVID-19.
Public debt continued to trend upward and it has breached the regional threshold of 60 per cent
of GDP due to weakening fiscal positions in 2020. Public debt increased from 55.5 per cent of
GDP in 2019 to 63.2 per cent of GDP in 2020. The increasing public debt levels will put additional
burden to Member States’ resources as debt service costs increase. Debt burden is expected to
worsen for SADC Member States with public debt forecasted to further increase to 69 per cent of
GDP in 2021. Member States’ expenditure continued on an upward trend as Member States
invested heavily in the public health system to mitigate human and economic impact of the
coronavirus. Member States are expected to spend more money to prevent, detect, control, treat,
and contain the virus. This will result in a mismatch of expenditures and revenues which will further
widen the fiscal deficit and worsen Member States’ debt position. The crisis has significantly
eroded the fiscal space and debt sustainability concerns are a growing challenge for Member
States. The risk of defaulting to service external debt is now high. Only six Member States
(Botswana, DRC, Eswatini, Lesotho, Madagascar and United Republic of Tanzania) achieved the
regional set target of public debt of 60 per cent of GDP in 2020.
External Sector
The region’s external sector performance in 2020 deteriorated in line with weak commodity prices,
the slowdown in global economic activity, escalated global trade tensions and due to the spread
18

-----------------------Page 18 End-----------------------

of COVID-19. However, the severity varied across Member States. The region’s current account
balance as a ratio of GDP widen from an average deficit of 5.1 per cent in 2019 to a deficit
averaging 8.4 per cent in 2020. Only three Member States (Namibia, Zambia and Zimbabwe) met
the regional current account balance target in 2020. Countries that are experiencing significant
current account deficits are Seychelles, Mozambique and Malawi.
SADC international reserves declined in 2020 as a result of the subdued demand, therefore a
majority of Member States were not able to meet the criterion of 6 months of import cover as the
gains made from their exports significantly decreased, with some of them falling short of the IMF
benchmark of 3 months of import cover. Only four Member States (Angola, Botswana,
Madagascar and Mauritius) recorded external reserves above the regional target of 6 months
import cover in 2020.
In terms of the exchange rate, the impact of COVID-19 resulted in exchange rates depreciating
at varying magnitudes in the first and second quarters of 2020. The currencies depreciated due
to downward revisions of economic growth projections, power supply interruptions and the
COVID-19 outbreak which resulted to a massive sell-off of risky assets and capital flows to safehaven assets such as the US dollar. Throughout 2020, the Angolan kwanza, the Zambian kwacha
and the South African rand were the most volatile currencies. The least volatile currencies were
the Tanzanian shilling and the Malawi kwacha.
Business Environment
According to UNCTAD World Investment 2020 report the COVID-19 pandemic will severely curtail
foreign investment in Africa in 2020, mirroring the global business environment tendency. The
downturn will be further exacerbated by the extremely low oil prices, considering the resourceoriented investment profile of the continent. Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) flows are expected
to decline between 25 and 40 per cent. Depending on the duration and severity of the global crisis,
the longer-term outlook for FDI in Africa could draw some strength from the implementation of the
African Continental Free Trade Area Agreement in 2020, including the conclusion of its
investment protocol.
The AfDB Southern Africa Economic Outlook 2020 report shows that there has been slow
progress in industrialization mainly due to an unfavorable policy environment for industrial
development, low public and private sector investment in value chains, supply-side constraints
such as volatile power generation capacity and limited energy source diversification into
renewable energy. All these factors have undermined the region’s competitiveness and economic
growth. For instance, the 2019 Global Competitiveness Index revealed that only four Southern
Africa countries were among the top 100 competitive countries. These were Botswana, Mauritius,
Namibia and South Africa.
However, the World Bank Ease of Doing Business 2019-20 report indicate that the SADC region
improved slightly in terms of having a conducive business environment and its competitiveness
in general. Seven Member States showed improvements in the ease of doing business ranking,
namely: DRC, Malawi, Mauritius, Namibia, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe, compared to the
six recorded in 2018. Two Member States (Mauritius and Zimbabwe) demonstrated exceptional
improvements by moving up more than 3 positions from 20 in 2018 to 13 in 2019 and 155 in 2018
to 140 in 2019, respectively.
Performance with regard to ease of doing business indicate that Angola, Botswana, Eswatini,
Lesotho, Mozambique, Seychelles, and South Africa slightly plummeted in their ranking positions
19

-----------------------Page 19 End-----------------------

in 2019 compared to 2018 performance. In 2019, four SADC Member States (Botswana,
Mauritius, South Africa and Zambia) were ranked within the first 100 bracket.

The tendency with regards to improving the business environment shows a similar behavior if one
considers the World Economic Forum Global Competitiveness Index (GCI) 2019-20. The GCI
measures the competitiveness of an economy by considering all factors from basic factors that
enable it to be competitive to factors that make it efficient and innovative.

In 2019, five Member States improved in the GCI ranking, namely: Angola, Malawi, Namibia,
South Africa, and Zimbabwe. Two Member States (Namibia and South Africa) demonstrated
exceptional improvements by moving up six and seven positions from 100 to 94 and 67 to 60
20

-----------------------Page 20 End-----------------------

respectively. The other ten Member States (Botswana, DRC, Eswatini, Lesotho, Madagascar,
Mauritius, Mozambique, Seychelles, Tanzania and Zambia) deteriorated their score.
In 2019, Mauritius, South Africa, Botswana Seychelles remained the most competitive and top
ranked Member States in the region, similar to 2018.
Regional Outlook for 2021-22
The Regional Outlook for 2021/22 is forecasted to grow by 2 percent in 2021 and 3.2 percent in
2022. The forecasted economic recovery in 2021 and beyond largely hinged measures put in
place to contain the spread of COVID-19 and mitigate its socio-economic impacts, which include
the enhancement of national and regional capacities in producing medicines, medical supplies,
and developing vaccines, and harnessing digital technology across sectors.
Annual inflation rate in the SADC region is projected to ease a bit to 15.4 percent in 2021.
Zimbabwe’s inflation is expected to decline significantly to 134.8 per cent in 2021 from 654.9 per
cent in 2020. Fiscal deficit is projected to narrow a bit from 6.8 per cent of GDP in 2020 to 5.4
percent of GDP in 2021. Only Angola, Botswana, DRC, Tanzania and Zimbabwe are projected to
achieve the regional fiscal deficit target of 3 percent of GDP in 2021. Public debt is projected to
increase from 63.2 per cent of GDP in 2020 to 69.0 percent of GDP in 2021. Only six Member
States (Botswana, DRC, Eswatini, Madagascar and Tanzania) are projected to achieve the 60
percent of GDP regional set target for the public debt in 2021.
Overall, Member States are projected to underperform in achieving the agreed macroeconomic
convergence indicators in 2021. Bottlenecks, such as, limited resources; and emergences of more
contagious strains of the COVID-19 Pandemic, may also undermine economic recovery and
ultimately dampen the growth prospects for the Region, as such the region is to remain alert and
vigilant.

III. Strategic Review and Policy Development
With the expiration of both the revised RISDP 2015-2020, and SIPO, the Vision 2050, and a
successor, the SADC Regional Indicative Strategic Development Plan (RISDP) 2020-2030 were
approved in August 2019. The SADC RISDP 2020-30 is a coherent and comprehensive
framework for the implementation of SADC’s regional integration agenda for the next 10 years.
To operationalize RISDP 2020-30 SADC Policy on Strategic Development, Planning, Monitoring,
Evaluation and Reporting (SPMER) was developed during the year. The objective of (SPMER) is
to strengthen and demonstrate SADC commitment towards evidence-based decision-making;
priority setting; strategy development; planning, monitoring, evaluation and reporting, as well as,
using results to enhance performance and impact of, amongst others, the RISDP 2020-30.
The 2020/21 Annual Corporate Plan marked the first year of implementation of the Regional
Indicative Strategic Development Plan 2020-2030, which was approved by Summit Heads of
States and Governments in August 2020 as commitment towards achievement of regional
integration. In order to contribute towards the RISDP 2020-2030 aspirations, which are central to
regional cooperation and integration, by end of March 2021, a total of 243 out of 287 annual
outputs were successfully completed, translating to 85% completion rate (see Figure 1), marking
it the highest performance in the past five Financial Years. The output implementation
performance over the 5-year period has remained relatively high. As outlined in Figure 1 below,
completion rate remained at 80% and above, with the exception of 2019/20 Financial Year (79%)
21

-----------------------Page 21 End-----------------------

(primarily due to the first wave of COVID 19 pandemic which affected the last Quarter of the
financial year). The Secretariat has maintained an impressive average completion rate of 81.4%
over the five-year period. More significantly, the 2020/21 performance marked the highest
achievement (85%) since 2016/17 Financial Year, despite strategic and operational challenges
brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic and other limitations outlined in Section 2.3 below.

The outputs which were not completed as planned in 2020/21 Financial Year are either being
implemented as part of the 2021/22 Annual Corporate Plan.
Implementation of the Regional aspirations as guided by Vision 2015 and the RISDP 2020-30, is
primary dependent on the successful implementation of projects and programmes that directly
contribute to the regional integration efforts. As such, the Secretariat successfully developed and
deployed tools and processes to enhance the overall management, design, monitoring and
evaluation of projects and programmes implemented by the Secretariat through facilitation of
projects timely reporting, reviews and reflection sessions.

IV. Implementation of Programmes of Regional Cooperation and
Integration
A.

Trade, Industry, Finance and Investment

Industrial Development
Industrialization remains the effective means of achieving the main goals of the SADC, namely
increased economic productivity, stronger Regional Integration and reduced poverty for people
living in the region through the generation of goods and services. During the year, and following
approval of the SADC Protocol on Industry by the 39th SADC Summit in August 2019, twelve (12)
Member States have signed the Protocol. Member States that are yet to sign are Democratic
Republic of Congo, Republic of South Africa and Republic of Zambia. It should, nonetheless, be
22

-----------------------Page 22 End-----------------------

noted that whereas, thirteen (13) Member States have signed the Protocol, it is only the Republic
of Seychelles that has submitted the instruments of ratification.
A Regional Gaps Analysis was conducted and a Regional Programme was developed as part of
regional measures to improve Industrial Competitiveness of SADC Member States. The
programme aims to ensure that all SADC Member States strive to achieve the same goals of
industrialization and eliminate chances of contradictory policy instruments that might work against
the SADC industrialization objectives.
A study to review the status of implementation of the Industrial Upgrading Modernization Program
(IUMP) was commissioned in 2020/21. The study aimed to explore measures to improve the
implementation effectiveness of the programme at Member State level as a tool for realizing the
underlying objectives of the SADC Industrialization Strategy and Roadmap. The reviewed IUMP
was circulated to Member States for validation and further comments.
The Secretariat continued to strengthen the role of Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) to
employment growth and national development by engaging Member States in identifying the
support required to enable implementation of a Regional Framework for Supplier Development
with the special focus on building capacities and capabilities of SMEs.
Market Integration
The SADC Simplified Trade Regime Framework and SADC Regional Customs Transit Guarantee
Regulations aimed at facilitating intra and extra SADC Trade were finalised and considered by
the Joint meeting of SCCC and SCTF held in September 2020.
The border posts assessment study was conducted for the Nakonde/Tunduma border posts
between Zambia and Tanzania and Songwe/Kasumulu border posts between Malawi and
Tanzania from December 2020 to March 2021. The guidance provided by the review is expected
to have an impact in the short to medium term in terms of improving efficiency and effectiveness
in the clearing passengers and goods at border posts and hence shortening the time taken to
release the goods.
The E-Certificate of Origin Framework was developed and approved. The E-certificate will help in
facilitating the application Certificate of Origin electronically thus easing cross border trade. The
Framework will be piloted in six Member States (Botswana, Eswatini, Malawi, Namibia, Tanzania
and Zambia). Progress report on the readiness for piloting the electronic certificate of origin were
received from Botswana, Eswatini, Malawi, Namibia, Tanzania and Zambia. The implementation
Manual of the e-CoO were also developed and the training on implementation of eCoO
Framework was conducted in March 2021. The Launch of eCoO transmission is scheduled for
September 2021.
The Protocol on Services has been ratified by 8 Member States. Thus, ratification of two more
Member States is required for the Protocol to enter into force. The first round of negotiations was
completed in six priority sectors identified in the Protocol namely communication, finance, tourism
and transport services, construction and energy-related services.
The Governments of Eswatini and Zambia ratified the Tripartite Free Trade Area Agreement
(TFTA), thereby joining Egypt, Kenya, South Africa, Rwanda, Burundi, Uganda, Botswana and
Namibia. Four additional ratifications are required to reach the mandatory quorum of 14
23

-----------------------Page 23 End-----------------------

ratifications to bring the TFTA into force. The African Continental Free Trade Agreement (AfCFTA)
entered into force on 30 May 2019. The SADC Member States that have ratified are Eswatini,
Mauritius, Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe.
Regional Value Chains
A study profiling SADC Aquaculture Value Chains conducted in 2020 identified 8 aquaculture
clusters (tilapia, salmonid, abalone, crustaceans, bivalve, marine finfish and pearl) and 24 values
chains. In addition, a priority project roadmap was developed, which outlines a series of
strategies, plans, projects, and activities by which to achieve the SADC Aquaculture Vision of 355
000 MT/yr by 2030, from the current 100,950 MT/yr in 2020. Some of the strategies include key
issues like governance, infrastructure, research and development, human capital, funding and
investment, as well as markets.
A Database of list of regional manufacturers of covid-19 related materials and pharmaceutical
products was prepared. A pilot project to support manufacturers of covid-19 materials was
launched during the review period with funding from the European Development Fund (EDF) and
GIZ amounting to Euro 2 million. A call for proposals was launched by GIZ to this effect in August
2020 ahead of actual support in 2021.
Through SADC’s Trade Related Facility (TRF) support programme, additional notable progress
during the review period observed in some Member States in the area of value chains include
developments highlighted below:
(i)

In the Republic of Mozambique, cotton, textiles, and forestry and wood sectors
have been capacitated. Under the cotton and textiles sector, Mozambique has
mobilised farmers to process part of their cotton outputs through provision of loans,
which they can use to make cotton thread and fabrics. Due to this support,
Mozambique is now producing most of its cotton wool instead of importing from
outside the SADC region. Further, it has collaborated with the private sector and
other cooperating partners to extend support to the farmers and small-scale fabric
and garment producers. Mozambique has also designed policies to enhance the
competitiveness of the forestry and wood sector as well as increase beneficiation.

(ii)

The Kingdom of Eswatini has managed to analyse and identify high priority
economic impact value chains to guide the development of the national strategy
for the value chain development as a major step taken by Government toward
promoting agro-processing and industrialisation in those chains and to link-up with
regional value chains. The four value chains analysed and identified include fruits
and vegetables, meat, honey and dairy.

(iii)

In the Republic of Malawi, one of the projects implemented enhanced the country’s
oilseed value chains through the involvement of and support to groundnuts,
sunflower and soya beans producers. Support involved the promotion of high yield
improving technologies and training of farmers through use of demonstration plots
including improving seed certification, soil and plant pest control, and facilitating
good agronomic practices through use of appropriate technologies. Such
improvements at country level will feed into the regional value chains in cooking oil
production.

Financial Market Integration
Payments System
In terms of the finance and investment in the Region, a total of 82 participating Banks, from the
fifteen (15) SADC Member States (except Comoros), were electronically linked to effect crossborder payments and settlements in real time. From August 2019 to June 2021 an additional
641.832 transactions were settled representing ZAR 2.32 Trillion equivalent of USD 162.15 billion.
Cumulatively, from July 2013 to June 2021, total number of transactions settled reached
2,170,372, representing ZAR 8.46 Trillion equivalent of USD 591.38 billion.
Following the successful launch of SADC-RTGS in July 2013, the region has embarked on the
implementation of a number of key initiatives pertaining to the regional payment, clearing and
settlement systems including the Mobile Initiated Low Value Credit Transfers Cleared on an
Immediate Basis (TCIB). This retail payments initiative aims at creating an efficient, safe,
harmonised and integrated payments system in the region, to further reduce cross-border
remittance costs across SADC region as well as to enhance financial inclusion. The soft launch
and testing of TCIB were successfully completed in 2019. AS a result, the SADC Regional
Clearing and Settlement System Operator (RCSO) (BankservAfrica Limited) has been onboard
in 2020 to manage the SADC Transfer Cleared on Immediate Basis payment scheme. A number
of non-banks are joining the TCIB scheme, as the SADC Payment System Subcommittee is
engaging with participants on the SADC RTGS to sponsor these non-banks to settle obligations
arising from the TCIB scheme. In addition, boarding of regional currencies on the SADC RTGS
multi-currency platform which went live in October 2018, is ongoing.
Capital and Financial Markets
Capital and financial markets integration is central to the development and integration agenda of
SADC. In 2019, a tool for monitoring implementation of the centralization of the bond markets in
SADC region was developed and progress on centralization of secondary bond trading on SADC
Exchanges is being monitored through a scorecard matrix.
Financial Inclusion and Remittances
In the area of financial inclusion, 68% of adults in the Region are financially included against the
target of 75% by 2021. In terms of gender split, 67% of female adults are financially included while
the rate is 70% for male. As per the decision of the Ministers of Finance and Investment at their
meeting in Namibia in July 2019, the SADC Financial Inclusion Subcommittee was
operationalised.
SADC continues to implement a number of initiatives which will further reduce the average cost
of cross-border remittances in the SADC region to below the G20 target of 5%. Among others,
given the success of the Shoprite remittance product to Lesotho, a same approach was launched
in Eswatini in January 2020. This new bank-retailer product aims to serve low value remitters in
the South Africa – Eswatini corridor and costs less than 3% on a price point of US$55. New
products have also been introduced between South Africa and Malawi, Zambia, DRC and
Zimbabwe. In addition, due to travel restrictions and closure of borders caused by COVID-19
pandemic, the informal remittances providers were negatively affected and therefore an increase
of 31,4% in the usage of formal cross-border remittances was noted: the total number of
25

-----------------------Page 25 End-----------------------

transactions (South Africa outbound) was estimated at 851,441 in June 2020 against 648,110 in
June 2019.
Furthermore, following further guidance from the Ministers of Finance and Investment at their
meeting in July 2019, three Members States, namely: Eswatini, Lesotho and Malawi have been
assisted with regard to the domestication of the SADC Mobile Money Guidelines. Malawi has
started paying interest on mobile money wallets.
Development Finance
With regard to project preparation, the SADC Project Preparation Development Facility (SADC PPDF) continues to support Member States to strengthen regional infrastructure connectivity by
providing grants for project preparation and development for cross-border regional infrastructure
projects in energy, transport, ICT and trans-boundary water. This directly supports the region’s
integration and industrialization efforts as well as trade in goods and services; and helps to
improve the quality of lives of its people by improving access to infrastructure services.
As at end of December 2020, PPDF had approved a total of US $ 20.9 million (after savings and
cancellation) for the preparation of fourteen regional projects covering energy, transport and water
sectors, which is expected to generate at least US$ 3 billion in infrastructure investment.
Furthermore, this has also the huge potential of unlocking business opportunities across the
“infrastructure value chain”, not just in advisory services, but also financing, construction,
equipment supply, technology and skills as well as operations and maintenance. The fourteen
regional projects are: Second Alaska Sherwood (Zimbabwe); Rehabilitation and upgrade of the
North South Rail Corridor (South Africa, Zimbabwe, Zambia and DRC); Kasomeno - Mwenda Toll
Road (Zambia); Angola - Namibia Transmission Interconnector 1 (Angola and Namibia); Mulembo
Lelya Hydro Electric Power (Zambia); Luapula Hydro Power Development (Zambia); Mozambique
- Zimbabwe - South Africa Interconnector (Mozambique, South Africa and Zimbabwe); Africa
Green Co projects (all Member States); Development of Guidelines and Standards for Renewable
Energy Projects and a Funding and Incentive Strategy Project (Mauritius); Angola - Namibia
Transmission Interconnector 2 (Angola and Namibia); Lomahasha-Namaacha Cross Border
Water Supply (Eswatini and Mozambique); Kazungula Water Supply and Sanitation Project
(Zambia); and Mauritius Wastewater Pumping Station and Wastewater Treatment Plant
(Mauritius).
On the other hand, the status on signature and ratification of the SADC Regional Development
Fund (SADC RDF) has not changed. A total of nine Member States (Angola, DRC, Eswatini,
Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe) have signed the Agreement.
None of the Member States has deposited instruments of ratification with the Secretariat. In order
to advance the operationalization of the SADC RDF, SADC Secretariat is currently in the process
of recruiting a consultancy firm to recommend on the full operationalisation of the Fund. Among
others, the consultancy assignment will review Member States’ challenges in ratifying the SADC
RDF Agreement as well as proposing suitable approaches for fast tracking the operationalisation
of the Fund.
Investment and Tax Related Matters
The global spread of COVID-19 is strongly affecting foreign investment in SADC. The recent
Global Investment Trends Monitor of UNCTAD predicts a drastic drop in global FDI flows by up
to 40% during 2020-2021, reaching the lowest level of the past two decades. Numerous SADC
26

-----------------------Page 26 End-----------------------

countries have adopted a variety of policy measures aimed at supporting investors and their
economies in general. Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic created challenges for Investment
Promotion Agencies (lPAs) in the region forcing them to shift focus from routine investment
promotion and facilitation towards crisis management.
Implementation of the SADC Regional Action Programme for Investment (RAPI) 1 progressed.
RAPI is aimed at establishing a conducive environment to attract both domestic and Foreign
Direct Investment (FDI) into the region. The SADC Investment Subcommittee in February 2021
reviewed the implementation of the Regional Action Programme for Investment (RAPI). Most of
the investment treaties have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, as such, through Peerto-Peer Learning Mechanism Member States exchanged information on how and why investment
treaties and laws can lead to potential Investors-States Dispute Settlement (ISDS) claims against
governments in the wake of the crisis and proposed options to mitigate such risks.
Development of a SADC Business and Investment Promotion Strategy (BIPS) was finalised
during the year under review. The SADC BIPS will allow SADC to explore opportunities to
showcase its programmes and regional projects to various key decision-makers from around the
world who are willing to engage in sustainable partnerships; and further benefit from a variety of
features aimed at facilitating strategic networking and promoting Foreign Direct Investment.
Macroeconomic Convergence Programme
SADC Member States faced multiple challenges in attaining macroeconomic convergence in
2020. As highlighted in Section I above, the majority of Member States underperformed in
achieving the agreed macroeconomic convergence indicators. The number of Member States
who met the set targets of the primary Macroeconomic Economic Convergence indicators
(Inflation, Fiscal Deficit and Public Debt) declined to two (2) Member States (Madagascar and
United Republic of Tanzania) in 2020 from four (4) (DRC, Madagascar, Seychelles and United
Republic of Tanzania) in 2019.
Whilst good progress had been made over the years towards meeting the MEC targets, the
exceptional impact of COVID-19 has caused an impediment in the convergence process, and
resulted in notable divergence from the MEC targets for the region. In view of the diverse
economies of SADC region, it was observed that they faced differing challenges in regards to the
pandemic, in terms of the extent to which their economies have been impacted. Whilst some
Member States seem to have stumbled in terms of performance, others have severely diverged
away from the targets. This unprecedented shock derailed the MEC programme, and uncertainty
remains high with regards to the recovery path and the outlook as the pandemic is still unfolding.
Notwithstanding the significant headwinds, as the effects of the pandemic are expected to linger
on for several years to come, there is commitment by Member States to implement recovery plans
to get the MEC programme back on track in the shortest possible time.

1

Pillars of RAPI: The first being Development and harmonization of relevant polices and frameworks for attracting and promotion of
both domestic investment and FDI; the second pillar relates to business and investment promotion; the third pillar relates to providing
relevant information to businesses and investors; and the last Pillar relates to peer to peer learning where investment promotion
agencies share best practices in investment promotion.

Trade Facilitation and Transport Instruments
The SADC Trade Facilitation Programme (TFP) was approved in July 2016 to support the
implementation of the Industrialization Strategy and Roadmap. The achievements on customs
and trade facilitation in 2020/21 include:

B.

(i)

Reviewed the SADC Simplified Trade Regime Framework aimed at reducing
barriers to trade by simplifying the customs procedures and processes, thereby
lowering transaction costs associated with formal trade in support of small traders.
The Framework will be presented to CMT in June/July 2021 for adoption.

(ii)

Reviewed the SADC Regional Customs Transit Guarantee (RCTG) Regulations
aimed at reducing transit costs and delays; developed RCTG manual, training
materials; and conducted awareness workshop to key stakeholders. The
Regulations will be presented to the CMT in June/July 2021 for adoption.

(iii)

Conducted border posts assessment for Nakonde/Tunduma border posts between
Zambia and Tanzania and Songwe/Kasumulu border posts between Malawi and
Tanzania. The aim is to improve efficiency and effectiveness in clearing
passengers, goods and means of transport at border posts. The assessment
identified lack of adequate infrastructure and equipment, uncoordinated operations
among border agencies and lack of capacity building programmes as main
challenges. The report and recommendations will be submitted to CMT for
consideration in June/July 2021.

(iv)

Following the adoption of the SADC E-Certificate of Origin Framework by CMT in
July 2019, an implementation Manual of the e-CoO was developed and training on
implementation of eCoO Framework was conducted in March 2021. The
Framework is aimed at deepening Regional Integration to facilitate industrialization
through easing trade for goods produced in the region as determined by SADC
Rules of Origin. The launch of eCoO transmission for the six Piloting Member
States (Botswana, Eswatini, Malawi, Namibia, Tanzania and Zambia) is scheduled
for September 2021.

Infrastructure Support for Regional Integration

Infrastructure remains a key enabler to SADC industrialization and regional integration at large.
As a contribution towards the availability and universal access to sufficient, integrated, efficient,
and cost effective infrastructure systems, as well as the provision of sustainable services; a total
of 13 small sub-grant Groundwater infrastructure projects were implemented in Botswana (3
projects of which 2 were legacy projects from a predecessor groundwater programme); Zimbabwe
(3 projects of which 2 were legacy projects); Eswatini, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia,
Tanzania and Zambia. The pilot projects reached 84,000 direct beneficiaries especially in small
rural communities and villages whose water security for domestic and livelihood activities was
greatly improved. Also through this pilot projects component, an estimated 200 people were
trained on aspects to enhance their skills for infrastructure planning, construction as well as
operation and maintenance.

Water
Groundwater Management Programme
Groundwater continues to be relevant and important to water security and poverty alleviation
through increased food production for the wellbeing of SADC citizens. It is estimated that over
70% of the 250 million people living in the SADC region rely on groundwater as their primary
source of water.
The SADC groundwater management programmes are being implemented through SADCGroundwater Management Institution (SADC-GMI) and so far, a total of 65 Young Professionals
from the Member States went through internship programmes relating to Data Collection and
Management, the SADC Groundwater Information Portal as well as the SADC Groundwater
Literature Archive.
Capacity building aimed to strengthen Member States Institutional Frameworks for Sustainable
Groundwater Management was conducted. The aim was to provide guidance to stakeholders on
identifying solutions for strengthening legal, policy, and regulatory tools. Ten training workshops
were delivered involving about 290 participants and an additional 118 people received training
dedicated to groundwater data collection, management and sharing.
Work was undertaken in 4 Transboundary Aquifers (TBA), namely Shire TBA shared by Malawi
and Mozambique; Tuli-Karoo TBA shared between Botswana, South Africa and Zimbabwe;
Khakea/Bray shared between Botswana and the Eastern Kalahari-Karoo Transboundary Aquifer
(TBA) shared between Botswana and Zimbabwe. The work typically entailed the elaboration of
technical reports on the characteristics of the TBAs as well as establishing priority strategic
actions through elaboration of Joint Strategic Action Plans.
Five (5) research studies were completed to generate knowledge on groundwater management
challenges in the Member States, namely Deep Aquifer exploration, Groundwater Infrastructure
Operation and Maintenance, Groundwater Resilience, Groundwater Data Collection and
Management, and Conjunctive Water Management. Furthermore, the 3rd SADC Groundwater
Conference was hosted virtually in November 2020. The primary objective of the conference was
to provide a platform for the advancement of knowledge sharing on sustainable management of
groundwater at national and transboundary levels across SADC Members States in light of the
threats imposed by the climate change.
Under the project funded through the World Bank support, 13 small sub-grant Groundwater
infrastructure projects were implemented in the Member States, namely: in Botswana (3 projects
of which 2 were legacy projects from a predecessor groundwater programme); Zimbabwe (3
projects of which 2 were legacy projects); Eswatini, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia,
Tanzania and Zambia.
The pilot projects reached 84,000 direct beneficiaries especially in small rural communities and
villages whose water security for domestic and livelihood activities was greatly improved. Also
through this pilot projects component, an estimated 200 people were trained on aspects to
enhance their skills for infrastructure planning, construction as well as operation and
maintenance.

Climate Resilient Infrastructure Development Facility Projects
The CRIDF programme has continued to implement a number of projects in the region, which is
now in the second phase. Following the completion of the rehabilitation of Mitema Pump Station
in the Makonde Plateau, Tanzania during Phase 1, the rehabilitation of the treatment plant and
uprating of main distribution pipeline to match the increasing pumping capacity is ongoing. The
Project seeks to improve access to safe and reliable water supplies to a population of about
408,000. In Namibia, a 50ha solar powered irrigation scheme is being implemented for a
community scheme with a membership of 50 households in Mayana.
As part of a SADC-wide Cross-Border Towns Water Supply, Kariba (Zimbabwe) and Siavonga
(Zambia) water supply schemes are being augmented to make the systems resilient to climate
shocks. The project was a direct response to water supply disruptions due to Lake Kariba’s
unprecedented low levels in 2020 and will ensure uninterrupted supply to 52 000 residents of the
two towns.
Energy
Implementation of SADC Renewable Energy Strategy and Action Plan
In order to enhance uptake of renewable energy and promotion of energy efficiency in all sectors
of economy, the Secretariat continued to monitor implementation of the Renewable Energy and
Energy Efficiency Strategy and Action Plan (REEESAP) as approved by Ministers responsible for
Energy in July 2017.
The Ministers responsible for energy affirmed their commitment towards United Nations
Sustainable Development Goal number 7 on increasing access to energy, sustainable utilisation
of renewable energy and promotion of energy efficiency by 2030 by approving the revised
Regional Energy Access Strategy and Action Plan (REASAP) in October 2020. The Plan adopted
the Multi-Tier (Tier 0 - Tier 5) Framework developed by the World Bank characterised, among
others, by universal access to reliable, affordable, convenient and safe electricity. The Ministers
approved and urged the Region to target Tier 3 energy access characterised by access to
adequate, reliable, affordable, environmentally sustainable energy services for all.
Expansion of Electricity Generation and Transmission Capacity
Region commissioned 2,400 MW in 2020 contributed by mainland Member States outlined in
Table 2 below. The commissioned capacity resulted into approximately 75 percent achievement
against the targeted capacity of 3,215. The COVID-19 affected the implementation and progress
of power generation and transmission projects in Region due to restrictions of movement and
reduced number of hours of operations. The table below shows the Regional Electricity
Generation and Transmission capacity in 2020.

when considering the operating capacity on 59,688 MW peak demand including required reserves
of 57,662 MW, the Region is sitting with excess capacity of 2,026 MW. As of March 2021, two (2)
Member States namely Angola and Mozambique had excess capacity while others rely on imports
to meet their growing demand.
The Regional Gas Master Plan (RGMP) Phase I was concluded in October 2020. The
implementation plan for RGMP Phase I was adopted by the Committee of Ministers responsible
for Energy covering five elements namely Economic corridors that maximise regional integration
and trade; Effective trade of natural gas and its downstream products; Enabling policy
environment; A highly skilled and innovative workforce; and Investment driven economic growth.
Establishment and Strengthening of Regional Centres of Excellence for Research and
Training in the Energy Sector
Ten Member States namely Angola, Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Malawi, Mauritius,
Mozambique, Namibia, Zambia and Zimbabwe have signed the Inter-Governmental
Memorandum of Agreement (IGMoA) on establishment the SADC Centre for Renewable Energy
and Energy Efficiency (SACREEE). The signed IGMoA will pave way for operationalisation
SACREEE as a legal regional organisation and for signing of Host Country Agreement with the
Government of the Republic of Namibia.
Assessment of sustainability of Kafue Gorge Training Centre (KGRTC) based in Kafue Gorge,
Zambia was carried out, and was cleared by the joint meeting of Ministers responsible for Energy
and Water in October 2020. KGRTC continues to offer short-term training on energy courses,
research and development services and hire-out conference facilities to sustain its operations.
KGRTC also receives support from the Government of Zambia through the Ministry of Energy as
part host Country obligation.
Development of Regional Energy Sector-Wide Regulatory Framework and Migration to
Electricity Cost Reflective Tariffs
All Member States (except the Union of Comoros) have established and operationalised energy
regulators. The DRC is the latest Member State to operationalise the regulatory agency in 2020
31

-----------------------Page 31 End-----------------------

after enacting the electricity law that provides for the establishment of a regulator. The Secretariat
in collaboration RERA, is expected to continue supporting energy regulator in DRC to join RERA
and to advise Comoros on fast-tracking establishment of the energy regulator.
Member States continued to review and approve lifeline tariffs and in the process of developing
pro-poor tariff subsidy mechanisms and as a gradual approach of migrating towards costreflective tariffs. Member States continued to offer government guarantees for power projects
and implementing the tariff adjustments to enable the power utilities to be able to fully recover
costs of electricity supply. Namibia, Eswatini and Mauritius have migrated to cost-reflective tariffs
while Angola, Lesotho, Mozambique, South Africa, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe have lifeline
tariff structures that allow for a minimum level of service. In preparation to migrate into cost
reflective tariffs, 11 Member States completed the cost of service studies (COSS).
Information Communication and Technology
SADC ICT Observatory
The SADC ICT Observatory is one of the flagship projects from the SADC Regional Infrastructure
Development Master Plan (RIDMP) whose objective is to become a central point of reference for
reliable, accurate and up-to-date collection and dissemination of ICT indicators, measurement,
benchmarking and reports. The SADC ICT Observatory monitors and evaluates the
implementation of the SADC ICT Programme, Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the
Digital Divide and enhancing Industrialisation in SADC through ICT.
An assessment Report on the Domestication of SADC Model Policy and Regulatory Instruments
as a Risk Treatment Action Plan 2020/21 has been prepared. The assessment measured the
level of domestication with regards to: Infrastructure Sharing, Universal Access, Internet
Exchange Point (IXP), Competition in Local Loop Telecoms, and Competition in ISP Market,
Policy on Broadband and Cyber Security Laws and National CIRT. Based on the 14 Member
States which participated in the survey, the overall average performance level of domestication
of SADC ICT Model Policy and Regulatory instrument and structures is 74%.
SADC Internet Exchange Points (IXPs)
Internet Exchange Points (IXPs) are a vital element in the Internet's Infrastructure ecosystem.
SADC Member States have deployed IXPs with the objective to reduce transit Internet Service
Provider (ISP) costs (International bandwidth), improve throughput, reduce latency and provide
better Quality of Service (QoS) and browsing experience for SADC Internet users. The SADC
M&E for IXP Implementation trialled during the SADC Internet Exchange Point (IXP) Workshop
in September 2020, established that South Africa and United Republic of Tanzania each have six
(6) IXPs, Angola, DRC and Zimbabwe each have two (2) while Botswana, Lesotho, Madagascar,
Malawi, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia and Zambia all have one (1) IXP. This amounts to a
total of 26 IXPs in the SADC Region and this is 57% share of the 46 IXPs in Africa. The SADC
M&E for IXP Implementation Form has been enhanced to contain definitions, respondent details
and collect data on IPv4 to IPv6 migration.
The IXPs have played a critical role in the performance of Internet access to scale up, adapt and
remain resilient through the COVID-19 pandemic. All SADC Member States except Seychelles
and Comoros have set up at least one National IXP. Four (4) IXPs (DRC, Namibia, South Africa
and Zimbabwe) are already peering with large number of foreign ISPs, thus making them
32

-----------------------Page 32 End-----------------------

Advanced IXPs. The SADC Roadmap and Guidelines for Transformation to Advanced IXPs was
developed to assist Member States in attracting Content Delivery Network (CDNs) such as
Google, Facebook, Microsoft to the SADC Region to further enhance the Internet. SADC
Masterclass Sessions have been introduced as an initiative to strengthened capacity of Member
States on best practices of Advanced IXPs.
Root Domain Name System (DNS) is a worldwide distributed platform that translates domain
names into Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. As at September 2020 there were 111 Root DNS
Server Instances in Africa of which 53 are from the SADC Region. All SADC Member States in
the SADC Region have at least one Root DNS Servers instances, except Comoros, Kingdom of
Eswatini and Zambia which are expected to have one in place by December 2021. Root DNS
servers closer to Internet users translates into improved speed of DNS services and more Root
DNS server instances provides greater stability and resilience to the Internet. SADC IXPs have
been urged to implement Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) starting with the dual stack by
December 2021 and also to devise mechanisms to attract local, regional and global Content
Delivery Networks (CDNs).
SADC Roaming Project
The SADC Roaming Project is being implemented in three phases with phases 1 and 2 already
completed. These phases are:
•
•
•

Phase 1: Liberalization, Transparency to roaming tariff, Information and Data
Collection;
Phase 2: Wholesale and Retail Price Cap Regulation: Roam Like At Home
(RLAH); and
Phase 3: Cost-based Roaming Price Regulation.

The SADC Roaming Project targets the development of policy and regulatory frameworks for the
provision of transparent and affordable mobile roaming tariffs for Voice, SMS and Data services
within the SADC region and thus contributing towards making the region more competitive. The
completion of Phases 1 and 2 has resulted in an increase in the transparency, consumer choice
and reduction in pricing of Roaming Services. In Phase 3, the SADC Roaming Cost Model
resulted in the computation of the wholesale and retail tariff ceilings for various roaming types of
calls, SMS and data services. The SADC Roaming Regulations (2015) have been revised and
now includes a schedule that refers to the wholesale and retail cost-based pricing proposals
approved by SADC ICT Ministers in September 2019 as well as timelines for Mobile Network
Operators (MNOs) to renegotiate the wholesale prices within the timelines of Phase 1 of the Final
Phase of the SADC Roaming Project. The revised regulations also address the issue on
permanent roaming in the context of fair use policy. A critical and essential element of policy and
regulatory requirement will be for Member States to implement the new regulation and review
appropriate regulations to allow for harmonisation of International Termination Rates (ITRs) in the
region. The Progress report on Implementation of final phase of SADC Roaming Project has been
prepared.
SADC Harmonized Cyber Security Legal and Regulatory Framework
The SADC Harmonised Cybersecurity Legal and Regulatory Framework of 2012 consists of three
(3) Model Laws namely: E-Commerce/E-Transaction Model Law, Data Protection Model Law; and
Cybercrime Model Law. Member States are at different levels of transposing the SADC
33

-----------------------Page 33 End-----------------------

Harmonised Cybersecurity Legal and Regulatory Framework. All Member States have either
transposed the SADC e-Commerce/ e-Transaction and Cybercrime Model Laws or have an
existing legal framework in place. Eight (8) Member States (Angola, Botswana, Lesotho,
Madagascar, Malawi, Mauritius, Seychelles and South Africa) have put into place laws on data
protection. Five (5) Member States (Lesotho, Madagascar, Malawi, Mauritius and South Africa)
have appointed an independent Data Protection Authority (DPA). Six (6) Member States
(Comoros, the Kingdom of Eswatini, Namibia, United Republic of Tanzania, Zambia, and
Zimbabwe) have official data privacy bills to be soon enacted. DRC and Mozambique are without
legislation nor constitutional protection. The SADC Data Protection Model Law requires
modernisation and to align it with current international best practices and principles such as the
EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) of 2018. An Action Plan has been developed for
the review and modernisation of the SADC Data Protection Model Law.
The SADC Regional CIRT (SR-CIRT) workshop convened in February 2021 to operationalise the
Framework for the establishment of the SADC Regional Computer Incident Response Team (SRCIRT). The SADC Regional CIRT (SR-CIRT) will be a regional collaboration platform to
strengthen the regional cybersecurity awareness, confidence, ability and speed of response to
computer security incidents as well as provide practical advice (detection and mitigation) to
individuals and organisations to protect themselves and reduce the risk of become a cybercrime
victim.
SADC Post Digital Terrestrial Television (DTT) Migration
Digital Terrestrial Television (DTT) has enabled better quality pictures and sound. Six (6) SADC
Member States (Kingdom of Eswatini, Malawi, Mauritius, Namibia, Tanzania and Zambia) have
completed the DTT Migration. Seven (7) Member States (Angola, Botswana, Lesotho,
Mozambique, Seychelles, South Africa and Zimbabwe) are at an advanced stage operating both
analogue and DTT networks (dual illumination) and are to pursue Analogue Switch Off (ASO).
The remaining three (3) Member States have deployed DTT networks however they are privately
owned and providing Pay-TV services, mostly in the densely populated city areas. The SADC TV
Channel called Eye on SADC has been piloted and ten (10) Member States (Angola, Botswana,
Kingdom of Eswatini, Lesotho, Malawi, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, Zambia and Zimbabwe)
are participating in the project. Post DTT, eight (8) Member States (Kingdom of Eswatini, Malawi,
Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, United Republic of Tanzania and Zambia) are streaming
their national public TV channel via the Internet. The Draft Code of Conduct of Broadcasters and
a report on the satellite system design and costing have been prepared.
Transport
Harmonisation of Regional Road Transport Laws, Regulations, Standards, and Systems
The Secretariat, as contracting authority, continued to coordinate and manage the Tripartite
Transport and Transit Facilitation Programme (TTTFP) funded by the EU. The TTTFP provides a
harmonised legal, regulatory and system framework for Member/ Partner States to implement the
harmonised minimum standards in cross border road transportation under the Multilateral Cross
Border Road Transport Agreement (MCBRTA) and Vehicle Load Management Agreement
(VLMA). The TTTFP which commenced in 2017 and was originally designed for 5 years ending
November 2021 but was extended to May 2023 to address delays occasioned by extended
negotiations and consultations on the legal instruments and COVID-19 Pandemic disruptions
2021. The lack of harmonisation in the Member/ Partner States’ response to the COVID-19
34

-----------------------Page 34 End-----------------------

pandemic, has also underscored the need for harmonised requirements relating to the movement
of persons and goods across borders in the region.
Model Laws & Regulations for Vehicle Load Management, Cross Border Road Transport, Road
Traffic, Road Traffic & Transport Transgressions and the Transport of Dangerous Goods by Road
were developed and approved by TCM in June 2021.
To facilitate the domestication of the VLMA and MCBRTA, five sets of Model Laws & Regulations
have been developed and were validated at the same time. The sets of Model Laws & Regulations
include the following: Vehicle Load Management, Cross Border Road Transport, Road Traffic,
Road Traffic & Transport Transgressions and the Transport of Dangerous Goods by Road.
System specifications, standards and design specifications for an integrated National Transport
Information System (NTIS) were developed for the operationalisation of the enabling legislation.
These included vehicle system; driver system; Operator system; Infrastructure system;
Transgression system and Accident system.
System specifications were developed for Vehicle Load Management Information System
(VLMIS), and Tripartite Transport Registers & Information Platform System (TRIPS). The
development of TRIPS was started with a target date for commissioning in October 2021.
Compulsory standards were developed and approved by Protocol on Trade - SADC Cooperation
in Standards (SADCSTAN) for Vehicle Roadworthiness; Driving Licenses; Transport of
Dangerous Goods by Road; Cross Border Road Transport Management System (XB-RTMS);
Accreditation of Weigh Stations and Verification (including Calibration) of Static and WIM Scales
at Weigh Stations; Number plates; Equipment on vehicles and safety requirements for vehicles;
Road Side Rest Stations; Road Traffic Signs; vehicle Testing Stations; Driving License Testing
Centres, and Weigh Stations.
SADC and Tripartite Guidelines and Standard Operating Practices on the movement of goods
and services during COVID-19 Pandemic were developed and validated by multi-sectoral
committees of officials and Ministers from Trade, Transport, Immigration, Customs, Immigration
and Security and further adopted by SADC Council of Ministers and Tripartite Council of Ministers.
Member States and Partners have agreed to develop and implement a common Monitoring and
Surveillance System to authenticate the validity of COVID-19 certificates and the monitor driver
and travelers’ wellness and monitor movements for the purposes of contact tracing if when
required.
Covid-19 Pandemic and the Development of the Corridor Trip Monitoring System (CTMS) Development and Pilot of the CTMS
At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in Africa during April 2020, the EU invited COVID-19
mitigation proposals and in response, TTTFP submitted technical and financial proposal for the
development, commissioning and maintenance of a surveillance and monitoring system for
drivers, vehicles and loads engaged in regional trade and transportation. EU awarded an amount
of EUR 3.6 million for the development, implementation, and maintenance of the Corridor Trip
Monitoring System (CTMS).
Due to the urgency of implementation of COVID-19 remedial measures to alleviate the disruptions
caused to cross border road transport and queues of several kilometers that regularly formed at
border posts, approval was given on 11 May 2020 for the development of the CTMS to proceed
35

-----------------------Page 35 End-----------------------

without delay, with a view to have the CTMS available for implementation within the shortest
possible time frames. Consequently, the 1st Release of the software became available on 22
June 2020 and a further 2 releases have since been completed.
Secretariat mobilized additional funding for CTMS equipment to be used by Officials of Members
States participating in the CTMS pilot from the Government of Germany through GIZ.
The following Member States-Botswana, Namibia, Zambia, Zimbabwe and DRC are participating
in the CTMS pilot being implemented on sections of the Trans Kalahari, Walvis Bay/ Ndola/
Lubumbashi and North-South Corridors. CTMS supporting user manuals and training material
were developed at the same time and made available to the operators. Workshops and training
for operators, policy makers and regulators was provided on the CTMS. Specific training was
provided on the use of the Operator Web Application by a number of operators in Botswana,
Namibia and Zambia.
The Lobito Corridor Trade Facilitation Project (LCTFP) funded by the African Development Bank
(AfDB) is intended to serve as a model for accelerating integration by providing support to member
states in adopting the regulations at national level in collaboration with The Tripartite Transport
and Transit Facilitation Programme (TTTFP), Association of Southern Africa National Road
Agencies (ASANRA), Southern Africa Railway Association (SARA), and cross SADC Directorate
stakeholders.
Harmonisation of Strategies, Policies and Regulatory Framework:
The Lobito Corridor Trade Facilitation Project (LCTFP) aims to coordinate joint corridor
development activities which seeks to accelerate growth in domestic and cross-border trade
through the implementation of harmonized trade facilitation instruments.
Measures, laws and regulations were developed in both the road and railway sectors to help
accelerate the harmonisation process under the Lobito corridor. This was achieved with guidance
of existing model Regional Laws and Regulations developed under the TTTFP, ASNARA and
SARA. The LCTFP has adopted this process to avoid duplicity and ensure alignment to the SADC
regional agenda.
Meteorology
Timely and credible meteorological and climate information and products were disseminated to
stakeholders to support planning for socio economic development, weather related disaster risk
management and the rational use, conservation and protection of natural resources. The
interventions aim to improve the meteorological infrastructure that are fully integrated, efficient,
and cost effective to meet the requirements of the users, and to minimize adverse effects of
severe weather and climate phenomena by the uptake of weather and climate information
services for development planning.
The Southern African Regional Climate Services for Disaster Resilience (SARCIS-DR) Project
was implemented to strengthen the capacity and capability of the 16 SADC Member States to
generate and disseminate climate information in a timely manner in response to climate-induced
disasters and reduce loss of lives and property damage. The project also aims to enhance the
capacity to use numerical weather prediction (NWP) models and regional climate models (RCMs)
for seasonal climate forecast. The Projects donated 40 Automatic Weather Stations, 14 High
36

-----------------------Page 36 End-----------------------

Performance Computing servers and two Automatic Message Switching System to benefiting
Member States, thereby improving the capacity of National Meteorological and Hydrological
Services to access, process and monitor of the weather- and climate-related data and systems
for timely early warning and information dissemination. It further capacitated the SADC Climate
Services Centre (CSC) to generate using its Cluster and upload daily, weekly and monthly
weather and climate information on its website (http://csc.sadc.int/) for use by the different
stakeholders in the Region. In addition, the Project conducted a series of capacity building
activities in early warning at national and regional levels, and 80 experts from various climate
sensitive sectors were trained.

The Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has had an unparalleled impact on most countries
worldwide. Undoubtedly, the impact of the pandemic will mark our world for a long time given the
unprecedented health and socio-economic crisis being felt in many countries. This has led to
drastic measures being taken by respective governments to mitigate the negative impact of the
pandemic on businesses and households. To control the velocity of the pandemic, national
lockdowns and partial border restrictions have been imposed by most countries. These measures
have severely impacted the education sector, creating a period of lost learning opportunities for
many students, most particularly for those in socially vulnerable groups.
Member States have responded in different ways to help students make up for the lost period of
learning by promulgating a variety of national strategies and policies. However, while these
initiatives from respective Ministries of Education to allow students to continue learning are
laudable, there has not been a regional response or any inter-country consultations on the best
practices for attending to the educational needs of children and youth in light of the effects of the
pandemic. Inter-country learning and the adoption of good practices should lead to the
development of an effective strategic plan to mitigate the effects of the pandemic and meet the
expectations of different stakeholders in the education sector.
Given the above, SADC Secretariat, with the support of UNESCO conducted a survey among
SADC Member States during the months of April/May, 2020, aimed at assessing the challenges
and measures taken by SADC Member States as well as those best practices which could be
adopted to mitigate the impact of the pandemic on education.
The survey findings highlighted a number of best practices such as: most Member States have
developed radio lessons and collaborated with national TV channels to ensure the continuity of
students’ academic learning; the establishment of platforms for online teaching and learning to
ensure the continuity of learning; some teachers and lecturers have been conducting virtual
classrooms while others have been using various conferencing applications and student portals
to deliver education; scheduling a ‘virtual’ graduation ceremony online enabling international
students to participate; Member States developing and using their own online platforms; Member
States dealing with the emotional health of students: for example, recruiting more teachers,
lecturers, psychologists and lab assistants to meet COVID-19 requirements and providing
guidance and counselling to students on how to adapt to change; and reinforcement of hygiene,
sanitary and social distancing measures at schools across the majority of Member States.

Finally, the recommendations to help Member States mitigate the impact of the Covid-19
pandemic to ensure ‘’Learning Never Stops’ were as follows: embarking on policy reform of the
education sector to cope with future crises such as changing assessment and examination
methods; adoption of a blended learning approach to address educational inclusion; collaborating
with international educational partners to take advantage of MOOCs and OERs; reinforcing
capacity-building strategies on distance and online teaching for academic staff and students;
reinforcing the role of parents and caregivers at home; investing in technological infrastructure
and the setting up of an integrated and ready-made parallel system of online learning.
Implementation of the SADC Qualifications Framework (SADC QF)
The establishment of the SADC Qualifications Framework with the accompanying quality
assurance guidelines is a very important milestone since it will serve to enhance mobility across
the region. To that end, Member States’ endeavour to align to the SADCQF cannot be understated
with South Africa and Seychelles having already aligned their national qualifications framework
to the regional one, and with a number of other member states having reached an advanced
stage, including Mauritius which has submitted its Alignment Report for Adjudication.
Development of the Regional Qualifications Recognition Manual
The proposal to develop a Qualifications Recognition Manual for the Southern African
Development Community (SADC) was first conceptualized at a September 2016 meeting of the
SADC Technical Committee of Certification and Accreditation (TCCA). At this meeting, members
explored ways through which they could accelerate the implementation of the SADC
Qualifications Framework (SADCQF). As part of the TCCA's strategy to accelerate the SADCQF,
the meeting agreed on an implementation model consisting of five implementation areas:
development and alignment of National Qualifications Frameworks to the regional; quality
assurance; verification; communication and advocacy; and Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL),
articulation and Credit Accumulation and Transfer System (CATS). In this regard, the Regional
Qualifications Recognition Manual has been developed as part of the SADCQF implementation
strategy.
The Recognition Manual was finalized and contains standards and guidelines on all aspects of
the recognition of qualifications and aims to provide credential evaluators from SADC member
states with general guidelines to assist them develop member country specific recognition
manuals; it provides general guidelines that make the recognition procedures transparent to all
stakeholders directly or indirectly involved in recognition such as; credential evaluators, education
and training institutions, learners, employers and policy makers; it aims to create more clarity
regarding recognition practices in all SADC countries and to contribute to a joint qualifications
recognition area, in which all SADC countries practice a similar methodology in the recognition of
qualifications, based on commonly agreed standards and guidelines; finally, SADC has given due
recognition to the fact that there has been divergence in the education and training system as
well as recognition practices among the different member states . It has also been recognized
that whilst there has been general consensus on what should be done, good practice may not
always be implemented, or may be interpreted differently. To that end, the Qualification
Recognition Manual may be regarded as a new and innovative tool that sets clear and uniform
standards for recognition practice. Such a tool will have multiple uses - serving as a starting point
for policy makers in order to review and improve national regulations, as a manual for credential
evaluators and as an informative tool for foreign learners, education and training institutions and
other stakeholders.

Development of the SADC Credit Accumulation and Transfer Systems
The development of the SADC Credit Accumulation and Transfer Systems (CATS) which informs
the recognition of accumulation and transfer of credits within the same or different qualifications
in different institutions in the SADC Region was finalised, and is expected to help to facilitate the
implementation of the SADCQF.
The rolling out of the Regional CATS is also expected to provide wide-ranging benefits to learners
and institutions including: it supports student/learner mobility (across geographies and
institutions) which in turn can improve lifelong learning opportunities and social mobility of underrepresented groups in general education, TVET or higher education; it reduces the risk of student
drop-out by reducing the time commitment required (as students do not have to restart their
studies from the beginning, and thus avoid repeating learning already undertaken) and creating
re-entry possibilities; it makes general education, TVET, or higher education more attractive and
accessible to under-represented and disadvantaged groups (e.g. encouraging part-time study,
and facilitating entry for those without formal qualifications through recognition of prior learning
[RPL]); it helps institutions to create customised learning opportunities for students and
employers; it permits institutions to be more responsive, particularly to the student market, and
as such increase opportunities for additional income generation; it contributes to higher student
retention and completion rates; and it promotes and facilitates inter-institutional partnerships
(such as progression pathways between TVET and higher education).
SADC University of Transformation
At the Council of Ministers Meeting in August 2019, Ministers directed the Secretariat to ‘expedite
the finalisation of the comprehensive skills audit, costed and time bound roadmap for the
operationalisation of the SADC Virtual University of Transformation and this has been finalised.
The regional skills supply and demand study focused on three (3) identified priority value chains
namely: Agro Processing, Mineral Processing and Pharmaceutical, and it related to the
identification of skills demand to inform the programmes to be offered in line with the agreed value
chains; it mapped the relevant existing academic programmes and qualifications being offered in
the region; and it identified the skills development programmes required to address gaps, as well
as the institutions which should be designated as Centres of Excellence and Centres of
Specialisation, including the type of operational and governance structures to be established.
The study also identified key economic realities driving skills demand in different value chains;
the current skills demand (high and medium skills), skills shortages and trends applied to forecast
future skills demand in the three value chains; the Regional and national policies (i.e. desired
outcomes) for the value chains, and the identification of skills that will be needed to realise these
outcomes.
In addition, the study has also provided an indication that the skills demand in each value chain
consists of the following categories: Existing degrees and diplomas based on the organic growth
of the formal core sectors of the different value chains. The forecasted demand is highest for the
agro-processing sector; followed by mineral processing (skills per annum) and pharmaceuticals.
The highest demand is forecasted for honours degrees and higher, while some 10-13% could be
on diploma-level; Upgraded trade certificates to occupational certificates at Technical, Vocational,
Education and Training (TVET) level to up-skill medium skilled workers currently employed in the
agro-processing and mineral processing Value Chains; Short courses and programmes to build
skills that respond to technological changes and other change drivers relevant to the sector to up39

-----------------------Page 39 End-----------------------

skill the current workforce in each value chain. This could involve some 50% of the current
workforce within each value chain as well as new workers; and Short courses and programmes
or postgraduate degrees linked to the actualisation of regional policy objectives related to each
value chain.
Progress Report on the inclusion of Southern African History in the School Curriculum
During the Council of Ministers meeting Ezulwini, Eswatini in August 2017, Council approved that
GCED values and the Southern African Liberation history be included in the school syllabus and
requested Ministers of Education to operationalise the decision. The decision was taken to ensure
that the younger generation in the SADC region have an opportunity to learn and critically reflect
on the history of the liberation struggles in the region. This will promote social cohesion and
regional identity. Furthermore, it will contribute to the implementation of Sustainable Development
Goals (SDG) 4 Target 7 in relation to “promotion of a culture of peace and non-violence, global
citizenship and appreciation of cultural diversity and of culture’s contribution to sustainable
development”.
Furthermore, at its Meeting in August 2019, Council requested the Ministers of Education,
Science, Technology and Innovation to submit a progress report on the development of the
Guidelines for the curricula on Southern African Liberation History and the Roadmap on the roll
out of the curricula by Member States. In this regard, following the findings emanating from the
desk review of curricula in all 16 SADC Member States to determine the level of integration and
teaching of global citizenship issues and values in primary and secondary schools, the Draft
Roadmap for integrating SALH and GCED in Member States curricula has been finalized.
School Feeding Programme
School feeding programmes target 20.5 million schoolchildren in the SADC region. The vulnerable
school children access to regular school meals and nutrition services during the pandemic was
affected as many of the children rely heavily on such services: either as the only meal consumed
in the day or contribute a significant part of their daily nutrient requirements. It is worth noting that
Member States adapted the school feeding programmes during the pandemic such as providing
home meal rations and cash transfers. It is well known that school feeding programmes
contributes to improving school attendance and retaining children in schools, however there has
been growing interest to further understand the cost benefit of these programmes in other sectors.
A Cost Benefit Analysis Study benefits of school feeding was conducted in collaboration with the
World Food Programme (WFP) based on high level and secondary data in five Member States
(Botswana, Namibia, Madagascar, South Africa and Zambia). The results indicated that that there
are potentially substantial returns to school feeding that should be included in national financial
policy making. The analyses also confirmed that the returns go beyond the returns to human
capital that have been measured previously and include significant benefits to other sectors. The
findings further indicated that school feeding programmes benefits can be seen across four
sectors namely the health and nutrition, notably in preventing the onset of soil-transmitted
helminth infections and anemia; education, in increasing school attendance and yielding higher
future adult wages; social protection, in transferring food, hence income, to schoolchildren and
their families; and agriculture, in supporting the growth of local food economic markets.

Employment and Labour
COVID-19 labour market impacts in SADC
An assessment of the regional labour market impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic was conducted
in an effort to strengthen Member States' capacity to respond to the challenges. The assessment
report produced projected job loss scenarios for 2020 and 2021, based on the historical
relationship between changes to GDP and changes to employment between the period 2000 and
2019. It is estimated that as a result of COVID-19 and response measures such as lockdowns
and movement restrictions, the SADC region suffered employment losses equivalent to 36 million
jobs in 2020. This figure reflects a combination of actual job terminations, lost working hours and
reduced wages during the height of the socio-economic impact as the labour market adjusted to
the crisis, while response measures still had minimal effects. The employment losses of 36 million
jobs represent 27% of the employed population in 2019, highlighting a huge impact on incomes
and livelihoods for SADC citizens.
The report also revealed that COVID-19 impacts had a disproportionate effect on particular
segments of the working population, notably women and youth. Women face greater risk due to
their overrepresentation in employment as contributing family workers and own account workers,
as well as care workers. The report showed that up to 55% of employment losses were predicted
for this classification of workers. Youth were overrepresented in service occupations, such as
retailing, hotel and catering, and tourism, which are most likely to be disrupted by strict
intervention measures and lockdowns. Migrant workers were also at high risk noting that some of
them in vulnerable employment as irregular migrants, with implications for the major countries of
origin where the share of remittances in GDP is upwards of 10%, notably Comoros, Lesotho and
Zimbabwe.
The report's recommendations are organised across five categories urging Member States to
continue fiscal and monetary rescue measures to boost employment; stabilisation of sectors that
drive the economy including in the export sector; targeted enterprise tax relief and wage support;
strengthening of social protection measures to cushion the vulnerable; and to promote dialogue
and consensus through the crisis. In line with some of these recommendations, Member States
have established various stimulus packages, in some cases up to 5% of GDP (Namibia and South
Africa), to revive the economy and protect jobs and livelihoods. The application of these response
measures has also included dialogue with broad stakeholders including workers and employers
organisations. In terms of long term measures, Member States are reviewing the feasibility and
adequacy of social security provisions such as unemployment benefits, with a view to enhancing
future labour market resilience.
SADC Employment and Labour Policy Framework developed
The SADC Employment and Labour Sector has developed its first comprehensive SADC
Employment and Labour Policy Framework, covering the period 2021-2030. The policy framework
addresses challenges relating to economic growth and employment creation, with a view to
enhance regional cooperation to reduce the serious decent work deficits in SADC. The policy
framework reveals that although unemployment is statistically low in some cases (ranging from
about 2% to 28% in 2019), more people are employed in the informal economy, where incomes
and social protection are lacking. In the case of youth, unemployment is notably higher, (ranging
from 3.9% to 57.4% in 2019) signaling that on average, there is more significant exclusion of
young people in the labour market. Informal employment is also very high, with shares of at least
41

-----------------------Page 41 End-----------------------

70% outside agriculture in some Member States resulting in the majority of workers being in
vulnerable/precarious employment, as self-employed or unpaid family workers (Malawi (60%),
Tanzania (77%), Angola (79%), Mozambique (80%) and Madagascar (85%). These working
conditions undermine the link between employment and growth, as the decent work deficits imply
that the current development path is not inclusive and not contributing to improved lives.
As a response, the SADC Employment and Labour Policy Framework establishes cooperation on
five priorities on increased job creation and inclusive growth; improved labour standards; inclusive
social protection; enhanced social dialogue and improved labour migration governance. A SADC
Decent Work Programme, which is the medium-term action programme for the policy framework
during the period 2021-2025 has also been developed to ensure rapid implementation. The
mentioned priorities are in line with the Regional Indicative Strategic Development Plan (20202030), and will be pursued through improved multi-sectoral coordination on employment creation
at both regional and national levels. Therefore, the approved Joint Sector Meeting of SADC
Ministers of Labour, Finance and Industry to be held during the 2021/2022 financial year will add
impetus towards implementation of the policy framework with the main objective to create more
and better jobs.
SADC Youth Empowerment Policy Framework
In the Employment and Labour Sector, the SADC Employment and Labour Policy Framework
covering 2021-2030 was developed and approved in April 2021. The Framework aims at
addressing challenges relating to economic growth and employment creation in the Region. The
SADC Youth Empowerment Policy Framework that aims to facilitate realization of the
demographic dividend in SADC was also developed and approved by the SADC Committee of
Ministers responsibly for Youth in 2021.
The policy framework notes that Member States have implemented several youth empowerment
initiatives, and that the institutional mechanisms for youth empowerment do exist at national
levels. However, it is noted that youth remain marginalized and disenfranchised as economic
opportunities are limited in the region. This has been worsened by the COVID-19 pandemic which
disproportionately affects those already disadvantaged. Young people were most likely to lose a
job than more experienced older persons. Youth were also more affected by disruptions to
learning as schools were closed in many countries, while the majority had no access to virtual
means of learning. These factors have disempowered youth and increased their vulnerability to
criminal behaviour, unintended pregnancies, loss of skills and earning potential and therefore,
long-term exclusion and poverty.
The SADC Youth Empowerment Policy Framework includes four key intervention areas as
follows, improved policy and legal framework for youth empowerment; enhanced youth skills
development and participation in the labour market and entrepreneurship; improved youth health
and wellbeing; and strengthened youth leadership and participation in governance processes.
Noting that youth participation in socio-economic processes and governance structures is still
weak in the region, the policy framework commits Member States to strengthen National Youth
Councils/Agencies capacities. Similarly, there is need to institutionalize the SADC Youth Forum
to amplify the voice of youth in regional integration programmes across all sectors. Another
important area relates to addressing youth lifestyle issues, including illicit drug and substance
use, and enhancing access to sexual and reproductive health and rights services. The policy
framework is due to be considered by the Ministers of Youth at their next meeting to be held in
the second half of 2021.

Health and Pharmaceuticals
Support the strengthening of health systems in Member States during and post COVID
periods
The advent of COVID-19 in the SADC region has caused severe disruptions in Member States’
health systems that were already fragile due to low financing, weak infrastructure, shortage of
human resources as well as low supplies of medicines and vaccines. The economic and social
disruptions caused by the pandemic is devastating for the region, tens of thousands lives have
been lost, tens of millions of people are at risk of falling into extreme poverty, while the number of
undernourished people is rising. The public health sector has particularly been impacted by the
pandemic due to inadequate preparedness and also because of measures that countries have
imposed in order to control the spread of the virus.
Member States implemented strict controls on movement in response to the covid-19 pandemic,
including; stay home orders, border closure as well as complete country or region lockdowns.
These measures have had profound effects on health systems across the region at varying
degrees. 10 out of 16 Member states reported severe disruption in child immunization activities
due to lack of vaccines and other implements, as well as growing hesitancy by parents to bring
their children to healthcare places. Other disruption included cancellation of elective surgery and
shortage of medicines and other medical supplies.
In response to the spread of COVID-19 in the region, in the week following the outbreak of COVID19 in South Africa, SADC Ministers of health re-activated the Technical Committee on Monitoring
and Coordinating the Implementation of the SADC Protocol on Health. The mandate of the
committee was expanded to include other relevant sectoral ministries, departments and
government agencies. In collaboration with the SADC Secretariat, recommendations regarding
Infection Prevention and Control (IPC), surveillance at border crossing points and information
sharing, including the guidelines on the facilitating the movements of good across Member States
were adopted.
Direct support was provided to Member States response to COVID-19. The Secretariat mobilized
funding from the African Development Bank to support the procurement and delivery of Personal
Protective Equipment (PPE), testing kits and biomedical equipment for six (6) ADF eligible
Member States, namely Lesotho, Malawi, Madagascar, Mozambique, Zambia and Zimbabwe.
The Secretariat, in collaboration with the Global Fund and NEPAD, has further developed a
proposal for addition funding to support Member States in the post-Covid-19 recovery period.
Coordination of the implementation of high level commitment by Member States to
eliminate diseases of major public health concern by 2030.
Elimination of Tuberculosis
SADC Heads of States, during their annual summit in Maputo Mozambique in 2012, signed a
declaration to eliminate Tuberculosis (TB) in the Mining Sector as the first step to ending TB in
the region by the year 2030. The Global Fund on TB, Malaria and HIV and AIDS provided funding
to develop regional programmes to support the operationalisation of the declaration. The first
phase of the funding known as “TIMS 1” 2015-2018 supported the establishment of harmonized
TB reporting systems and the development of regional tools for tracking TB across national
borders. “TIMS 2” supported the building of regional infrastructure and information sharing
43

-----------------------Page 43 End-----------------------

systems to help monitor TB epidemiology movements across the region. One of the digital
systems that have been established is the Cross Border Referral System (CBRS) which tracks
the movements of patients with TB across the borders and alerts healthcare providers in order to
ensure continuum of care. Since 2015, all countries have reported a general decline in TB cases,
with a regional average of 37%. The TB case notification has increased by 50% between 20182019, which demonstrated an increased effort in finding missing people with TB.
Malaria Elimination
In 2018 in Windhoek, Namibia, SADC Heads of States signed the Declaration on Malaria
elimination in all SADC Member States. This signifies that all countries in the region must now
develop and implement programmes that are aimed at ending malaria by the year 2031. Eight (8)
countries in the region had embarked on the malaria elimination campaign since 2009, under an
initiative known as the SADC E8.
The initiative has significantly pushed forward the elimination agenda in all the participating
countries, to the point where some countries such as Botswana and Eswatini are closer than ever
to be declared malaria free. In line with the SADC Declaration on ending malaria, the Secretariat
working with the SADC E8 and other partners have developed implementation plan and the
accountability framework to support Member States define their own milestones and timelines
towards the elimination of malaria.
Since 2000, substantial increases in funding have improved the availability of life-saving malaria
interventions in the SADC region. This has resulted in marked reductions in malaria, morbidity
and mortality. Significant progress has been recorded in the SADC region with four (4) Member
States having achieved less than 5 per thousand, making them eligible for malaria elimination.
Over 96% of the malaria cases between 2011 and 2018 are accounted in 5 countries; DRC 29%,
URT Mainland 18%, Mozambique 14%, Zambia 13%, Malawi 13% and Angola 9%. There has
also been some significant progress being recorded with Zimbabwe and Madagascar starting
reorientation towards malaria elimination at subnational levels. Angola and DRC contribute 68%
between 2015 and 2018 (25% and 42% respectively) to the total malaria deaths recorded within
the SADC region. A reduction of 20.5% mortality was between 2014 and 2018, which shows
steady progress in the fight against malaria in the SADC region.
SADC Pooled Procurement Services (SPPS)
The Pooled Procurement Services has been conceived as one of the tools to foster a common
development agenda in line with the quest for regional integration. It is specifically intended to
address issues relating to disparities in the prices of medicines among Member States,
harmonization of pharmaceutical procurement practices and medicine quality assurance. The
SPPS also aims at ensuring adherence and compliance to international standards in
pharmaceutical supply chain management.
The SPPS which is managed by the Medical Stores Department (MSD) of Tanzania has been
operational since April 2019. A number of milestones have been achieved since then including;
the development and approval of the SPPS guidelines by Ministers of Health in 2019, the updating
and publishing of the SADC essential drug list, the development by of the E-SPPS system by the
MSD and more importantly the effective use of the SPPS by four (4) Member States, namely;
Comoros, Mozambique, Seychelles and Tanzania.

SADC Medicine Regulatory Harmonization
The SADC Secretariat, in collaboration with the African Medicines Regulatory Harmonization
(AMRH) and Member States National Medicines Regulatory Agencies formed a consortium in
May 2011 in Lilongwe, Malawi, aimed at improving the availability of medicines through the
regional harmonization of regulatory systems, guidelines and processes among Member States
in the SADC by building regulatory capacity and capability; sharing information to facilitate faster
decision making; harmonizing the system of medicines registration and broadening the scope of
products reviewed (new chemical entities, vaccines and biologicals) and regulatory functions
undertaken (clinical trial oversight, pharmacovigilance); and achieving political, legislative and
financial support by communicating the value of the project to all stakeholders
Through a funding facility by the World Bank, significant milestones have been achieved and
regulatory harmonization of pharmaceutical manufacturing, including; market authorization,
marketing and pharmacovigilance have gone beyond the normative stage to full scale
implementation in all 16 Member States. Advanced training and capacity evaluation training have
been conducted by WHO and all Member States have participated. The self-benchmarking
assessment on the regulatory maturity levels of each Member States has been conducted and
the gaps are being bridged through training and capacity building sessions that are funded by the
World Bank.
The Secretariat working with partners such as the WHO, the World Bank and AUDA-NEPAD has
constituted a forum of Heads of Agencies of National Medicines Regulatory which is composed
of heads of the 16 NMRAs in the region. The purpose of this undertaking is to ensure that the
National Medicine Regulatory Authority (NRA) is the institution in charge of assuring the quality,
safety, and efficacy of medical products as well as ensuring the relevance and accuracy of product
information. A sustainable, well-functioning regulatory system will ensure an independent and
competent oversight of medical products.
Nutrition
The SADC region has more than 18.7 million stunted children (being too short for your age). The
stunting prevalence is above 30% - classified as high to very high - in 9 of the 16 SADC Member
States. There are Member States that have shown a decline in the prevalence of stunting as
compared to the baseline data in 2012, namely Eswatini, Madagascar, Malawi, Namibia, United
Republic of Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe. The Reduction in stunting is occurring too slowly
to meet the World Health Assembly (WHA) 2025 or the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)
2030 targets.
The prevalence of wasting (acute malnutrition) ranges from 2.0 percent in Eswatini to 15 percent
in Madagascar. The WHA target is to maintain childhood wasting to 5% and below by 2025 which
has been achieved by most of the Member States, however there are also pockets of high wasting
rates (above 10%) in the DRC (Greater Kasai, North Kivu, South Kivu and Tanganyika provinces),
Mozambique (Nampula), Southern Angola (Cunene and Huila provinces) and Southern
Madagascar (Atsimo Andrefana and Amosy regions). Furthermore, the prevalence of overweight
amongst children under age 5 is high, at more than 10% in 4 Member States (Botswana 11.2%,
Comoros 10.6%, Seychelles 10.2% and South Africa 13.3%).

-----------------------Page 45 End-----------------------

Impact of COVID-19 in the Nutrition Sector
In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic increased the risk to malnutrition due to the lockdown measures
taken by various Member States to contain the spread of the virus, affecting access and provision
of essential nutrition services due to restrictions on mass gatherings, affecting community
outreach services such as immunization, vitamin A supplementation and mass mid-upper arm
circumference (MUAC) screening in some Member States, which further limited the coverage of
vulnerable children. Member States adapted implementation to maintain delivery of essential
services. The adaptations included simplifying admission protocols for children with severe
wasting, expanding the teaching of mothers and caretakers to identify when their children are
malnourished and what to do (Family MUAC), and use of mobile technology for data collection
and reporting.
The COVID-19 containment measures implemented by SADC member states delayed, most food
and nutrition assessments, surveys and routine information management systems in the majority
of SADC countries. District health information software 2 (DHIS2) was the only routine monitoring
system that all member states reported were mainly utilizing for data during the COVID-19
pandemic. DHIS2 was reported to have been facing no or little challenges. National Vulnerability
Assessments and Analysis (NVAA) were planned by eight countries and seven managed to
conduct them although they were all delayed. Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique,
Tanzania and Zimbabwe had planned the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) in 2020 but did
not manage to undertake them due to the pandemic.
The Regional Minimum Standards for Micronutrient Food Fortification
In the SADC region, the prevalence of (iron deficiency) anemia in women of reproductive age
ranges between 20 percent in Namibia to 54 percent in Mozambique. All the Member States have
the Prevalence of Anemia in women of reproductive age and children under 5 years of above
20%. According to WHO, a prevalence of 20% and above is regarded as a public health concern
with 40% above referred to as severe public health concern. As mentioned earlier,
overweight/obesity is also a growing challenge in the region, both among adults and young
children.
In the Region, there are six (6) Member States (Malawi, Mozambique, South Africa, United
Republic of Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe) with mandatory food fortification standards and
regulations for cereal flours. Therefore, the adoption of food fortification by these Member States
is an indication that food fortification of staple foods is one of the preferred interventions to address
micronutrient deficiencies in the region. There is a global consensus that a mix of interventions
that increase intake of micronutrients from the diet can reduce and prevent diseases associated
with insufficient intake of micronutrients. Interventions include micronutrient food fortification,
dietary diversification and supplementation.
The SADC Minimum Standards for Food Fortification were developed and validated by the SADC
Member States in August of 2020 and approved by the Ministers in November 2020. The intention
of the minimum standards for food fortification is to accelerate adoption of one of the cost-effective
interventions to address micronutrient deficiencies in the region and facilitate regional trade of
fortified commodities. The Standards include salt iodisation; edible vegetable oil (with Vitamin A)
and staple foods; wheat flour and maize flour (with Vitamin A, Iron, Zinc, Folic and Vitamin B12).
These foods were chosen because they are widely consumed among the population and easily
accessible as such are ideal vehicles for increasing micronutrient intake widely in the
46

-----------------------Page 46 End-----------------------

communities. Various stakeholders in the SADC Member States including Standards Regulating
Bodies, Ministries of Health, Food Industry representatives, Food Security cluster and nutrition
partners were consulted during the development process. The next step in 2021 is rolling out the
Standards to SADC Member States to facilitate alignment with the national regulations/strategies
on food fortification.
SADC Strategy for Social Behavioural Change and Communication for improved Infant and
Young Feeding Practices.
Ministers of Health during their meeting held in Polokwane, South Africa in November 2017;
directed the SADC Secretariat to facilitate the development of a regional strategy for behavior
change communication for improved infant and young child feeding practices. Currently, an
average of 40% of infants 0-5 months old are exclusively breastfed. Exclusive breastfeeding rates
in the first 6 months in the SADC Region has been increasing in several Member States, however,
only 7 out of the 16 Member States (Democratic Republic of Congo, Eswatini, Lesotho, Malawi,
United Republic of Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe) have exclusive breastfeeding rates of 50
percent and above which is the target set by the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the region.
Infant and young child feeding practices are core to understanding the nutritional status of
children. In addition, appropriate feeding is multi-dimensional (including factors such as quality of
food, mother’s time, level of education and cultural norms). Therefore, the minimum acceptable
diet (MAD) is a composite indicator that reflects both diet diversity and frequency. In the SADC
region, minimum acceptable diet is very low, ranging from 8% (Zimbabwe) to 38% (Eswatini). For
the vast majority of children, the quality, quantity and frequency of complementary feeding is
inadequate for optimal growth and development in the region. The SADC SBCC Strategy and a
toolkit has been validated by Member States.
Report on implementation of the World Health Assembly (WHA) 69.9
Resolutions and its Recommendations for nutrition
In November 2019, Ministers of Health approved the technical regulation for the marketing of
breastmilk substitutes and designated products. Further, a study was undertaken by UNICEF
Eastern and Southern Africa Regional Office (ESARO) and Helen Keller International (HKI) as
part of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation-funded Regional Initiatives for Sustained
Improvements in Nutrition and Growth (RISING Initiative) to assess the level of awareness and
extent of integration of the seven WHO guidance recommendations into country-level acts,
regulations, policies, strategies, and plans in SADC and IGAD regions.
To facilitate adoption of the technical regulations for Marketing of breastmilk substitutes and WHA
Resolutions, a series of engagements were conducted in 2020 in collaboration with UNICEF
(Head Quarters & Regional office), Helen Keller International.
Cost Benefit Analysis study on Nutrition Interventions
Globally, there is an increasing recognition on the importance of nutrition on child welfare and on
economic growth and national development. Mainstream economists are adopting nutrition
indicators as an argument for investment in nutrition. Investing in ending malnutrition is one of the
most cost-beneficial steps governments can take with every USD 1 invested in proven nutrition
programs offering benefits worth USD16. Scaling up evidence-based nutritional interventions for
47

-----------------------Page 47 End-----------------------

improving child and maternal health in the SADC region can fast track progress towards
attainment of the WHA Nutrition targets by 2025.
UNICEF ESARO supported a study on the cost–benefit analysis (CBA) to determine the economic
value of nutrition investments aimed to reduce the incidence and prevalence of nutritional
deficiencies. To implement the CBA, detailed country-specific data were used to initially estimate
the cost–benefit ratio for six SADC Member States: Madagascar, Malawi, Mozambique, Tanzania,
Zambia, and Zimbabwe. This was then extrapolated to estimate health impacts, monetary
benefits, and costs for the SADC region.
HIV and AIDS
The over aching objective of the HIV and AIDS key area is to reduce the number of new HIV
infections and AIDS related deaths so that HIV and AIDS is no longer a threat to public health
and to socioeconomic development of the region.
Ending AIDS Epidemic by 2030 and Impact of COVID 19
In 2016, All SADC Heads of States and Government reaffirmed their commitments to end the
AIDS Epidemic by 2030 and in line with that decision ; Member States set important milestones
such the 90-90-90 targets to be achieved by 2020 by all countries, the objectives were to have :
90% of all people living with HIV knowing their HIV status, 90% of all people with diagnosed HIV
infection will receive sustained antiretroviral therapy and 90% of all people receiving antiretroviral
therapy will have viral suppression by 2020.
At the end of 2019, four (4) SADC member States namely Eswatini, Namibia, Zambia and
Zimbabwe have achieved the 90-90-90 targets with Eswatini also having reached the 95-95-95
target 10 years before the deadline. This achievement means that at least 86% of PLHIV in
Eswatini have a suppressed viral load. In relation to the first 90 target, eight Member States
already have achieved the first 90 in 2019; these are Eswatini, Namibia, Lesotho, Botswana,
South Africa, Malawi, Zambia and Zimbabwe; while 5 countries (Eswatini, Madagascar, Namibia
Zambia and Zimbabwe) reached the second 90 and 5 countries have achieved the third 90.
However, with the advent of COVID 19 there has been major hindrance in HIV service delivery
which has threatened the progress made in this area. While ART provision was generally
maintained during the 2020 COVID-19 lockdown in most Member States, HIV testing and ART
initiation was heavily impacted during the same period hence it is predicted that the region may
see more incremental deaths from HIV, TB and malaria in 2021 as a consequence of the
disruption caused by COVID-19 in 2020. It is therefore urgent to scale up the adaptive measures
that health facilities adopted to continue the fight against HIV to ring-fence the progress made in
the fight against HIV and AIDS and prevent health care systems and community responses from
collapse.
Revitalization of HIV Prevention
In 2017, Ministers of Health and those responsible for HIV and AIDS reaffirmed their commitment
to ending AIDS by 2030 in line with the global commitment and further agreed to strengthen HIV
Prevention with the aim of reducing new infections by 75% in 2020 compared to 2010. To that
end, the regional score card for HIV prevention was approved in 2020 compared to 2010, the
number of new HIV infections in the region has dropped by 37% while the number of AIDS related
48

-----------------------Page 48 End-----------------------

deaths have been halved. Despite this, the region will not achieve the 75% reduction target as
agreed in 2016. Moreover, Adolescent girls and Young Women and their sexual partners continue
to bear the brunt of the HIV epidemic as they account for 40% of new HIV infections in 2019.
Likewise, Key populations continues to be more vulnerable to HIV as compared to the general
population the SADC Key Population Strategy and the SADC guide for HIV Prevention among
Adolescent Girls and Young Women and their sexual partners have also been finalised in this
reporting period, and these programming tools serve as an invaluable resource to Member States
as they implement their programmes.

Food, Agriculture and Natural Resources

The Secretariat continued to implement the Regional Agricultural Policy (RAP) for improved
agricultural production, productivity and competitiveness; improved regional and international
trade and access to markets of agricultural products; improved private and public sector
engagement and investment in the agricultural value-chains; reduced social and economic
vulnerability of the region’s population in the context of food and nutrition security, and the
changing economic and climatic environment; enhanced sustainable management and
conservation of wildlife, transboundary natural resources and environment. FANR is equally
addressing Regional Tourism development.
Production, productivity and competitiveness of crops, livestock, forestry, fisheries and
wildlife to support trade, industry and food security in the region
The region approved an additional 24 crop varieties to be registered and released through the
SADC Harmonised Seed Regulatory System (HSRS), giving a total of 84 crop varieties eligible to
be produced and traded throughout the region. These include maize, wheat, beans, groundnuts,
sorghum and soya beans. As part of regional efforts to boost agriculture, HSRS was developed
to promote seed accessibility and availability to realise objectives outlined in the Regional
Agricultural Policy (RAP). The HSRS provides for a harmonised law in the registration, release of
crop varieties and application of agreed standards for seed quality. The use of high and known
quality seeds is fundamental to enhancing agricultural productivity, food security, and rural
livelihoods. In addition, seed is a preferred tool for re-establishing the livelihoods of farmers
affected by disasters and to return them to life dignity, independent of handouts. Access to quality
seeds also facilitates diversity to food resource diversification and prevention of genetic erosion
in rural agriculture.
Three Regional Strategies for management of Fruit Flies, Tomato leaf Miner (Tuta absoluta) and
Fall Armyworm were produced and approved during the period under review. The strategies are
meant to improve production and productivity, enhance trade opportunities, and minimize postharvest losses, contributing decisively, in this regard, for achieving food security in the region and
increasing intra and inter-regional trade of agricultural products. The strategies were approved by
the Member States in May 2021.
The Regional Strategy for Animal Genetics Conservation and utilisation and implementation
mechanisms were developed and approved. Animal Genetic Resources (AnGR) are essential
building blocks of sustainable agriculture. AnGR are those animal species that are used or, may
be used, for food and agriculture and the populations within those species as well as their stored
genetic materials (semen, oocytes, embryos, somatic cells, DNA).
49

-----------------------Page 49 End-----------------------

A Regional Framework for Antimicrobial Resistance Control was developed and approved by the
Member States, to address the rise of antimicrobial resistant (AMR) organisms, which is
threatening to render existing treatments ineffective against many infectious diseases and thus
reverse the gains that has been achieved using antimicrobial agents. Globally, an estimated
700,000 human deaths are caused by drug resistance each year, and, if current trends continue,
AMR could result in over 10 million deaths per year and over USD100 trillion in lost output globally
by 2050.
Market access for agricultural products (crops, livestock and natural resources)
The Regional Agricultural Information Management System (AIMS) Strategy was developed and
validated. The System will provide policy-makers, planners and economic players’ access to
reliable and timely information that is necessary for policy development, emergency preparedness
and planning. Furthermore, a Roadmap for integrating national to regional Agricultural Information
Management System (AIMS) was developed. Four reports of assessments on the level of
integration of AIMS were produced for the Democratic Republic of Congo, Lesotho, Mozambique
and Zambia. AIMS is key to increase agricultural production, productivity and competitiveness;
and equally is key for increased market access and trade of agriculture products.
Social and economic vulnerability in the context of Food and Nutrition Security
The SADC RVAA System Vulnerability Assessments and Analysis Guidelines for Assessments
in the Context of the COVID-19 Pandemic was developed. The Guidelines assisted Member
States in rolling out Urban Assessments for the season, while taking into account the effects of
COVID-19 in the Urban set ups. Thirteen SADC Member States (excluding Comoros, Mauritius
and Seychelles) conducted their 2020 annual vulnerability assessments through the support of
the Regional Vulnerability Assessment and Analysis (RVAA) Programme, which were
documented in the 2020 Synthesis Report on the State of Food and Nutrition Security and
Vulnerability in Southern Africa in July 2020, and showing more than 50 million of food insecure
people in the region, the highest number ever recorded by this Programme, and calling for urgent
matters to address this reality.
Moreover, during the 2020 assessments, at least five Member States (Eswatini, DRC,
Madagascar, Mozambique and Zimbabwe) have incorporated chronic vulnerability into their data
collection and analysis, and additional Member States are expected to do the same for the 2021
assessments. In addition to that, twelve National Vulnerability Assessment Committees (VACs)
have integrated at least three emerging issues (Nutrition, HIV/AIDS, Gender, Markets, Integrated
Food Security Phase Classification, Poverty Reduction, Resilience to Climate Change) into their
annual assessments. Four (4) countries (Botswana, Mozambique, South Africa and Zimbabwe)
reported on poverty assessment and only Zimbabwe undertook analysis on Resilience for 2020.
Amidst COVID-19 travel restrictions, Member States were enabled to collect data of food and
nutrition status through the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) Mobile Monitoring
System (mVAM) to assist Member States to collect data remotely to inform the status of food and
nutrition security. The mVAM system is able to provide near real-time capabilities using low-cost,
mobile-based, and high frequency approaches. In addition to that, the mVAM system is able to
identify key trends in food security, able to help ensure early warning and preparedness thereby
identifying seasonal/cyclical vulnerabilities and other patterns in food security. Significant
progress has been achieved towards development of functional Early Warning System in the
SADC Member States. By end of December 2020, ten Member States (Botswana, Lesotho,
50

-----------------------Page 50 End-----------------------

Malawi, Mauritius, Namibia, Seychelles, South Africa, United Republic of Tanzania, Zambia and
Zimbabwe) had functional Early Warning Systems.
The support to Member States was provided to align their Food and Nutrition Security Strategies
(FNSS) to the Regional FNSS and this was successfully completed in January 2021. The food
and nutrition security strategies of 11 Member States (Comoros, DRC, Lesotho, Madagascar,
Malawi, Mauritius, Mozambique, Seychelles, South Africa, Tanzania and Zambia) were assessed
for alignment with the regional FNSS and recommendations produced, and 8 of these national
FNSS’s were assessed for status of implementation.
Sustainable management of natural resources (fisheries, forestry and wildlife) in the region
Regional guidelines for Forest Fire Management, Forest Participatory Management, Forest
Information System, and the Forest Strategy for the period 2020-2030 were produced and
validated by the Member States. All these instruments will crucially progress with the
implementation of the Protocol on Forestry, which aims (i) to promote the development,
conservation, sustainable management and utilization of all types of forests; (ii) promote trade in
forest products throughout the Region in order to alleviate poverty and generate economic
opportunities for the region; and (iii) achieve effective protection of the environment and safeguard
the interests of both the present and future generations.
The Regional Financing Facility for SADC Trans-Frontier Conservation Areas was approved by
the Council of Ministers in 2018 and was successfully established in 2020. This action, which is
fully part of the SADC TFCA Programme, will go a long way in strengthening effective
conservation of regional natural resources, for the benefit of regional biodiversity, economic
development, local community livelihoods and regional integration process.
The Zambezi Fisheries Programme was reviewed to include upper Zambezi River which will be
implemented within KAZA TFCA by Angola, Botswana, Namibia, Zambia and Zimbabwe. The
implementation of the programme was also monitored in the mid-to lower Zambezi River in Lake
Malawi/Niassa/Nyasa implemented by Malawi/ and Mozambique, and in Lake Kariba by Zambia
and Zimbabwe) and transboundary waters of Zambezi River. In addition, the Secretariat
monitored implementation of the Fisheries Protected Areas (FPAs) within the two key
ecosystems, the Mahale Mountain National Park, Lake Tanganyika Freshwater Protected Areas
(FPAs) and South East Arm of Lake Malawi FPA, and the status report was developed into a best
practice, for ease of adoption and use by other FPAs.
A report on the status of implementation of the fisheries programme of the Southwest Indian
Ocean Fisheries Commission (SWIOFC) was developed for seven SADC Member States
(Comoros, Madagascar, Mauritius, Mozambique, Seychelles, South Africa and United Republic
of Tanzania). The main objective of SWIOFC is to promote the sustainable utilization of the living
marine resources of the Southwest Indian Ocean sub-region, by the proper management and
development of the living marine resources, and to address common problems of fisheries
management and development faced by the Members of SWIOFC, without prejudice to the
sovereign rights of coastal States.
The Draft SADC Regional Fisheries Monitoring Control and Surveillance (MCS) Strategy was
developed, reviewed and approve. The strategy is expected to ensure compliance and
enforcement, and such sustainable management of fisheries. The strategy will also reduce illegal,
unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing is achieved in all SADC countries through enhanced
MCS programs.
51

-----------------------Page 51 End-----------------------

Four (4) Member States (Botswana, Malawi, Namibia and Zimbabwe) were supported in
implementing the regional aquaculture programme. The National aquaculture strategies, policy
briefs, factsheets and success stories were developed for Botswana, Malawi and Namibia to
support alignment and implementation of regional and national aquaculture frameworks.
Zimbabwe was supported to strengthen the tilapia value chain, with funding support from EU
through the ACP EDF-11 programme, and implemented by FAO.
Disaster Risk Management
Disasters including droughts, tropical cyclones, torrential rains, floods and wildfires, animal and
crop pests and diseases and the corona virus (COVID-19) continue to devastate the region and
lead to loss of lives and livelihoods, resulting in the disruption of services and destruction of
infrastructure. These disasters often recur before communities can recover from the previous
episodes.
Due to the La Nina event, in 2020, the region experienced cyclonic disturbances and storms,
these included Tropical Storm Chalane that made landfall on 30th December 2020, in north-east
Madagascar bringing thunderstorms and torrential rains. Tropical Cyclone Eloise also made
landfall on 23 January 2021, south of Beira city in Sofala province and brought heavy rains and
flooding that was experienced across the region. These also affected other inland countries
including Botswana, Eswatini, South Africa, Zimbabwe and Zambia that also experienced heavy
rains and floods. The flooding that occurred in parts of Eastern and Central Africa in January to
May 2021, led to the overflow of Lake Tanganyika, resulting in damage to housing, schools and
health centres, destroyed thousands of shelters in DRC, Tanzania and other great lakes
countries.
In view of these recurrent disasters and in line with the decision of the SADC Council of Ministers
made during its meeting in August 2019 in Dar es Salaam the United Republic of Tanzania, which
mandated the Secretariat to expeditiously finalize the operationalization of the SADC Disaster
Preparedness and Response Mechanism by August 2020, the Secretariat has developed a
number of regional instruments and mechanisms to facilitate a coordinated disaster preparedness
and response. These include the development of:
(i)

the Contingency plan for the SADC Standby Force participation in humanitarian
assistance operations during disasters in the region. This included follow ups with
Member States to provide pledged resources including human resources and
equipment to support the SADC Standby Force humanitarian responses during
disasters, which has led to some SADC Member States providing the pledged
resources for humanitarian support;

(ii)

the Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for the SADC Humanitarian and
Emergency Operations Centre (SHOC) and the Emergency Response Team
(ERT). The SHOC will be a coordinating Centre for Humanitarian support
operations in the region, while the ERT will provide direct assistance to Member
States affected by disasters. Following the decision of the SADC Council of
Ministers during their meeting in March 2021, to accept the offer by Mozambique
to host the SHOC, the Centre will be based in Nacala, Nampula Province in
Mozambique;

52

-----------------------Page 52 End-----------------------

(iii)

the Disaster Risk Management Policy Programme and Peer Review Mechanism
Framework 2020-2030 that will facilitate DRR peer learning across Member States.
Two Member States, namely Malawi and Namibia have participated in the pilot
peer review. The process has created a platform for undertaking peer reviews by
all SADC Member States;

(iv)

the Regional Disaster Risk Management Information Management System (IMS)
that will facilitate archival and sharing of DRR information across Member States.
The DRM IMS is a portal under the SADC website, and the IMS has been rolled
out with Member States trained on how to access and utilise the system;

(v)

the Disaster Risk Management Fund documents that includes governance
modalities and monitoring and evaluation framework, Resource Mobilisation
Strategy and Sustainability Plan. Once fully operationalised, the Fund will help the
region to support Member States affected by disasters;

(vi)

A Regional Disaster Risk Situational Assessment Report and Maps as well as a
Roadmap for the transit of relief goods and services. The roadmap will facilitate the
transit of relief supplies during disasters including pandemics and address a
number of logistical challenges that lead to disruptions in the cross border transit
of essential goods and services;

(vii) Training modules and simulation exercise guidelines to support capacity building
for disaster preparedness and response across the region. This included the
undertaking of virtual training and simulation exercise in the course of the year.
(viii) Guidelines for mainstreaming DRR across the various sectors at the Secretariat
level. It is anticipated that the roll out of the guidelines will help to integrate disaster
risk management principles in sectoral strategies, programmes and interventions,
which is expected to cascade to the national level.
These instruments were approved by Ministers responsible for Disaster Risk Management.
Following endorsement by Council, the full operationalisation and roll out of these regional
coordination and response mechanism instruments is expected to strengthen and enhance the
region’s capacity to effectively prepare and respond to disasters while also building the necessary
resilience of Member States and communities to deal with disasters.

E.

Cross-Cutting Programmes

Gender Equality and Development
During the financial year 2020/21, the Gender Unit in its core strategic objective to enhance
gender equality, women empowerment and development, and eliminate gender-based violence
in the SADC region, embarked on the development and approval of policy instruments that will
catalyze regional gender programmes progress journey towards gender equality.
Specifically, under the Gender Equality and Development key result area, the SADC Regional
Guidelines on Developing and Implementing National Gender Action Plans was developed and
duly technically validated by Member States in March 2021. The Guidelines are intended to
catalyse implementation of the objectives of the SADC Gender Protocol by providing guidance
53

-----------------------Page 53 End-----------------------

tools for operationalization of this Protocol at Member State level, and they further guide Member
States on general areas of focus in development and implementation of the national gender action
plans and strategies. The Guidelines will be presented to the Gender and Women's Affairs
Ministers in their 2021/2022 meeting for endorsement before printing and dissemination to
Member States.
In an effort to support the goal of moving women into productive work, that is, Women’s Economic
Empowerment, the SADC Secretariat has mobilised resources from the German Government to
the tune of 2 million Euros to support implementation of the SADC Regional Multi-Dimensional
Women’s Economic Empowerment Programme (RMD-WEEP) through a Project on
Industrialization and Women Economic Empowerment that aims to increase women owned
businesses’, and female entrepreneurs’ participation in value addition for selected
sectors/regional value chains as per the SADC Industrialization Strategy. Furthermore, the project
aims to optimise women’s entrepreneurial potential to tackle challenges faced by female
entrepreneurs or to- be entrepreneurs. The project document/proposal has been developed and
agreement signed for implementation to commence in June 2021.
The Review of the 2008 SADC Gender Mainstreaming Toolkit is ongoing to produce user-friendly
and sector-specific gender mainstreaming modules that will guide Member States and other
regional stakeholders in mainstreaming of gender in sectoral programmes. The aim of this Gender
mainstreaming resource kit is not to transform Member States’ participants into instant gender
experts, but to make them more aware of the relevance of gender in their work and to help them
identify the appropriate tools to be used when mainstreaming gender. So far, two sector-specific
modules of Industrial Development and Trade and Food, Agriculture and Natural Resources and
a generic module on Gender Mainstreaming have been completed and the remaining modules
will be finalized in the year 2021/2022.
Under Gender Based Violence key result area, implementation of the SADC Regional Strategy
and Framework of Action for Addressing Gender Based Violence (2018-2030) focused on the
following initiatives and their achievements:
(i)

Review of GBV Legislation: A review of GBV legislation in SADC region was
conducted. The Draft Report of the GBV Legislation review was validated by
Member States in February 2021. The review exercise established how
comprehensive national legislation is, in responding to GBV and in aligning with
provisions of the key regional and international GBV instruments. The review also
provided key recommendations per Member State on gaps to address in
strengthening of GBV legislation.

(ii)

Development of the SADC Regional Guideline on Developing GBV Standard
Operating Procedures (SOPs) and Referral Mechanisms: The Regional Guideline
on Developing GBV SOPs and Referral Mechanisms were developed and
validated by Member States in November 2020. The Guideline provide Member
States with concrete and pragmatic guidance on steps to follow in the development
and implementation of the GBV SOPs and referral mechanisms in order to facilitate
access to quality, timely and appropriate services for GBV victims/ survivors. The
Guideline will be presented to the June 2021 Gender Ministers Meeting for
adoption before rolling-out to Member States.
54

-----------------------Page 54 End-----------------------

(iii)

Development of the SADC GBV Training Guidelines: The GBV Training Guidelines
have been developed and validated by Member States through a regional meeting.
The training guideline is intended to support capacity building efforts of key GBV
service providers and stakeholders at Member States level. The Guideline will be
presented to the June 2021 Gender Ministers Meeting for endorsement before
rolling-out to Member States.

(iv)

Review of GBV Indicators: A preliminary review of the GBV indicators as reflected
in the SADC Gender Protocol Monitoring, Evaluation and Reporting Framework
have been conducted with Member States through a regional workshop in March
2021 that resulted in identification of GBV indicators to be amended and
recommendations on additional indicators. In addition, Member States identified
strategic GBV indicators to be reported on an annual basis in order to update
SADC leadership on the status of GBV and to inform regional advocacy against
GBV.

(v)

Engaging Member States on effective response to GBV during COVID-19: The
SADC Secretariat engaged virtually with the 16 Member States through a
workshop to provide guidance on effective response to GBV, particularly during the
COVID-19 crisis.

(vi)

Promoting Implementation of the SADC Regional Strategy for Addressing GBV:
The Strategy was disseminated through regional meetings with around 175 people
from different sectors within Member States (Police, health, social services, gender
& CSOs) and stakeholders reached and through the SADC social media platforms.
The SADC commitment to addressing GBV was further reflected through the
commemoration of the 16 Days of Activism against GBV Campaign during which
the SADC Secretariat Executive Secretary presented a regional statement
highlighting the GBV response priorities for SADC.

Statistics
During the financial year 2021/21, the Statistics sector achieved significant milestones in the
development and approval of policy instruments guiding regional statistical programmes. In
particular, the draft Protocol on Statistics was technically and legally cleared by Member States.
In addition, the draft Regional Strategy for the Development of Statistics (RSDS) has been
produced and strictly aligned to SADC Vision 2050 and RISDP 2020-30.
A needs assessment study of the Region`s statistical system was undertaken in collaboration with
the World Bank and the National Statistical Offices (NSOs) of Member States. The study revealed
that the region needs significant improvements to ensure harmonization through statistical
capacity building in the area of statistical methodologies, data collection and data analysis. The
detailed results of the study shall be the major input to the development of regional statistical
programmes in the short and medium term.
Furthermore, a draft tool for undertaking in depth reviews of national statistical practices in the
area of consumer prices statistics was developed and approved during the period. The main
objective of producing such a tool is to have a robust mechanism for undertaking data quality
assessment in prices statistics on an annual basis to identify major challenges Member States
are facing in this area and necessary actions taken thereby.
55

-----------------------Page 55 End-----------------------

The regional bulletins to provide statistical updates on regional integration was produced and
disseminated. In particular, monthly harmonized consumer price indices bulletins, Selected
Indicators and the Statistics Yearbook for Demography and Social Statistics were released on
SADC website.
Science, Technology and Innovation
A regional mapping and scoping study was commissioned and a number of potential regional
Centres of Excellence and Centres of Specialisation were identified. The recommendation of the
study has been validated by experts during the meetings of the Technical Committee on Higher
Education and Training and Research and Development held in October 2020 and May 2021
respectively.
A Concept document on the status of Intellectual Property in the region was developed during the
review period. Some of the findings indicated that a number of Member States have outdated
National IP Policies and some of the Member States are in the process of reviewing their national
policies. Capacity building programmes will continue during the financial 2021/22.

V.
A.

IMPLEMENTATION OF CORPORATE ACTIVITIES
Human Resources and Administration

The impact of COVID-19 Pandemic necessitated changes in undertaking business. The SADC
Secretariat developed a teleworking guidelines and implemented measures to mitigate the spread
of COVID-19 Pandemic. In this regard, a technical team was put in place to monitor the evolution
of the situation and advise Management.
Employee engagement and Customer survey was conducted with the aim to improve level of staff
engagement and Service delivery to the internal stakeholders. The Secretariat achieved 71%
employee engagement rate which indicates a good employee satisfaction rate. Also, the Human
Resources and Administration Policies for Records and Archives Management, Protection of
Personal Data and Communication and Media were approved by Council of Ministers.
Furthermore, the Automation of Performance Management System module was developed and
operationalised in line with the reform process to improve compliance, reducing errors and
timeously reporting. Lastly, additional Security features have been incorporated into the SADC
Machine Readable Laissez-Passer; Production of 5,000 booklets of the Machine Readable
Laissez-Passer was completed in Germany and arrived in Gaborone, Botswana in March 2021.

B.

Communications and Public Relations

The Southern African Development Community’s (SADC) turned 40 years of its journey from 1st
April, 1980 when its forerunner, the Southern African Development Coordination Conference
(SADCC) was formed as a loose alliance of nine majority-ruled States in Southern Africa, before
eventually transforming into SADC on 17th August, 1992, following the signing of the Declaration
and Treaty by the Summit of Heads of State and Government in Windhoek, Namibia.
In this regard, several interventions on Communication, Awareness and Visibility of SADC were
undertaken with the aim of bringing to light the history of SADC and key achievements that the
56

-----------------------Page 56 End-----------------------

region has made since 1980 to enhance awareness on the relevance and value of SADC. These
included include commemoration of SADC’s 40th Anniversary and production of a publication “40
years of SADC Enhancing Regional Cooperation and Integration” and several promotional
materials and news articles resulting in increased media stories, and mention of SADC
interventions.
In addition, several interventions aimed at facilitating enhanced corporate communication
including the development of tools such as the Communication and Media Policy; and the SADC
Writing and Editing Style Guide were approved by Council of Ministers and SADC Secretariat
Management respectively.

C.

Legal Affairs

Two (2) legal instruments, namely (i) the Agreement regarding the Status of SADC Stand-by
Force and its Components Deployed within the Region for Purposes of Training, Peace Support
Operation, Exercises and Humanitarian Assistance; and (ii) the Agreement amending the SADC
Protocol on Firearms, Ammunition and Related Materials in the Southern African Development
Community Protocol were adopted by Summit of Heads of States in August 2020.
Two Reports, namely (i) Consolidated Report on Harmonisation of Authentication Procedures and
(ii) Consolidated Report on Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Civil Judgements and
Arbitral Awards were developed and considered by the Committee of Ministers of
Justice/Attorneys Generals at its virtual meeting held in January 2021. The Committee approved
and adopted the Consolidated Report on Harmonisation of Authentication Procedures and
referred the Consolidated Report on Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Civil Judgements
and Arbitral Awards for national consultations.
During the Financial year 2020/21 two (2) additional Member States, namely, the Republic of
Namibia and the Republic of Zambia ratified the Protocol on Trade in Services bringing the
number of ratifications to the Protocol to nine (9).

D.

Information and Telecommunication Technology

The Secretariat continued to support implementation of the corporate activities planned for the
financial year 2020/21. With the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Secretariat and Member
States saw a shift from face to face interactions to virtual meetings to deliver on the mandates.
This called for significant investment in information and technology (ICT) infrastructure; expansion
of internet broadband; and exploration of various virtual platforms. In addition, the revised SADC
Corporate ICT Policy was approved by the Council of Ministers in March 2021. The SADC
corporate users are continuously being supported remotely to ensure delivery of set objectives.

E.

Procurement

The impact of COVID-19 Pandemic necessitated changes in undertaking the procurement
activities. The Secretariat transitioned into online bidding which allowed electronic submission of
bids and technical proposal; and virtual evaluation adjudicating processes. This resulted in a quick
turn around on concluding these procurement activities. The online bidding process facilitated
57

-----------------------Page 57 End-----------------------

online filling of procurement documents in line with Management approach of securing the critical
procurement documents.
Despite the persistent procurement challenges brought about by COVID-19 pandemic, the
Secretariat was successfully concluded 14 large service contracts amounting to US$28 million in
addition to other various contracts, (ii) concluded the first ever Multiple framework contract for
services to facilitate quick engagement of consultancy services, (iii) concluded a total of 40
contracts for other procurements and 5 grants contracts, (iv) commenced bidding process for 04
x open calls Grants and award anticipated by September 2021.

VI. Continental Cooperation and Integration
A.

African Union (AU)

The Secretariat continued to engage with the African Union (AU) in promoting continental
integration in line with the Treaty establishing the African Economic Community. The Secretariat
participated at the 2nd Mid-Year Coordination Meeting of the African Union, Regional Economic
Communities (RECs) and Regional Mechanisms (RMs) held in October, 2020. Issues discussed
at the meeting included COVID-19 and the various initiatives in response to Pandemic in Africa;
the Status of Integration Report 2020; Division of Labour between the AU, RECs, and RMs; and
the Status of the AU Financial Institutions.
The Secretariat participated in the preparation of the 2020 Status of Integration Report which
recognizes the many achievements made in African integration but also points out that much
remains to be done. The slow or total non-implementation of Continental and regional policies,
projects and programmes is a big and recurring challenge on the Continent. The Report also
acknowledges the various initiatives geared towards supporting regional integration on the
Continent including implementation of Continental flagship projects as identified in Agenda 2063
and the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA).
The Secretariat also continued to work closely with the AUC in finalizing the proposals on Division
of labour between the AU, RECs, and RMs. An Interim Report which covers only three sectors:
Trade, Political Affairs, Peace and Security was produced. Further work is being undertaken to
finalise the remaining sectors, with a view of submitting the Final Report at the 35th Ordinary
Session of the AU Assembly in February 2022.
Following the establishment of a new structure and process for the selection of the Senior
Leadership of the African Union Commission (AUC), the AUC launched the process of recruitment
in June 2020 and Member States/Regions were requested to submit their nominations. The
Secretariat facilitated the process to strategize on the candidatures from the SADC region.
Ultimately, two (2) candidates from the region were elected and appointed by the 38th Ordinary
Session of the Executive Council of the African Union. These are Josefa Leonel Correia Sacko
from Angola as the Commissioner for Agriculture, Rural Development, Blue Economy and
Sustainable Environment, and Albert Muchanga from Zambia as the Commissioner for Economic
Development, Trade, Industry and Mining.

A.

SADC – EU Cooperation

Following the successful commitment of all Contribution Agreements under the Sub-Regional
Envelope (worth Euro 90 million) of the 11th EDF Regional Indicative Programme (RIP) in the FY
2019/20, the Secretariat has proceeded with the implementation of the various programmes,
including programmes under the Infrastructure Envelope (worth Euro 20.18) and the Intra-ACP
Strategy Paper and Indicative Programme (worth Euro 16 million). An internal evaluation of 10th
and 11th EDF Programmes was conducted to assess the achievements, the quality and the
results of the 10th and 11th EDF programmes as executed by the SADC Secretariat, with a view
59

-----------------------Page 59 End-----------------------

to highlight key successes and potential opportunities in the SADC-EU partnership in the context
of an evolving cooperation policy with an increasing emphasis on result-oriented approaches and
the contribution towards the implementation of the Regional Indicative Strategic Development
Plan (RISDP).

B.

SADC - EU Political Dialogue

The SADC-EU Senior Officials Political Dialogue held in September 2019 had agreed to convene
a SADC-EU Ministerial Political Dialogue during the first half of year 2020. However, the
Ministerial Dialogue could not proceed as planned due to COVID-19 restrictions and safety
protocols. Despite these restrictions, the Secretariat continued to engage bilaterally with the EU
and other EU Member States to maintain the momentum of development cooperation.
The Secretariat held trilateral engagements with the Embassies of German, France and EU on
31 August 2020 to exchange technical views on the proposed priorities of the post 2020 Joint
Africa-EU Strategy and share information on the outcome of the 40th SADC Summit of Heads of
State and Governments held on 17 August 2020.
The Secretariat further held bilateral courtesy meetings with the Senior Inspector and Managing
Director for Africa at the European External Action Service (EEAS) on 9 February 2021 and 25
February 2021, respectively. Both meetings discussed development cooperation issues that are
of mutual interest to both SADC and the European Union, including issues on peace & security,
political dialogue and post 2020 programming of regional cooperation, and broadly to ascertain
how the existing development cooperation can be enhanced for a more impactful partnership. It
is through these engagements that an agreement was reached to convene a Ministerial Political
Dialogue during the first quarter of FY 2021/22. Consultations on the prospective agenda and
dates are on-going between the SADC Secretariat, EU Delegation (Botswana) and the EEAS
(Brussels).

C.

SADC – Germany Cooperation

Following the successful Bilateral Negotiations on Development Cooperation between the
Southern African Development Community (SADC) and the Federal Republic of Germany in
November 2019, SADC-Germany cooperation continues to support, among others, Regional
Economic Integration (covering also Peace, Security and Good Governance); Transboundary
Water Management; Transboundary Natural Resource Management and Resilience to Climate
Change; and Strengthening National-Regional Linkages.
These programmes are implemented through a commitment worth Euro 30.0 million for both
technical and financial cooperation, bringing the total envelop to Euro 40.36 million with the earlier
commitments made in 2018.
In addition, the Federal Republic of Germany provided support to the SADC Secretariat and
SADC Member States with additional measures for the prevention and management of the
negative effects of COVID-19 in the SADC region, through interventions covering a number of
sectors that are in line with SADC priorities and the aforementioned areas of focus of SADCGermany Cooperation.

60

-----------------------Page 60 End-----------------------

The objective of SADC-Germany Cooperation is to enhance SADC's capacity as the main
coordinating body for regional integration in the Region. Areas of cooperation are agreed through
SADC-Germany Bilateral Negotiations on Cooperation held once in every two years.

D.

SADC – Russia Cooperation

With a view to concretizing implementation of the two Memorandum of Understanding (MoUs),
namely, the MoU between the Government of the Russian Federation and the Southern African
Development Community in the Area of Military-Technical Cooperation signed in July 2018; and
the MoU on Basic Principles of Relations and Cooperation signed in October 2018, the SADC
Secretariat continued to engage with Russia.

E.

SADC – China Cooperation

The SADC Secretariat continued to engage with the Embassy of the People’s Republic of China
in Gaborone, with a view of concretizing the actions agreed upon in the Framework Agreement
on Economy, Trade, Investment and Technical Cooperation between SADC and the Government
of the People’s Republic signed in October 2019, and enable implementation of activities of
mutual interests that will promote SADC regional integration agenda in line with the RISDP 20202030.
The Government of the People’s Republic of China also continued to extend annual grant of US$
100,000 to support the SADC Secretariat on its operational needs, using a programme approach
that shall enable the Secretariat to attend to urgent requirements and implement programmes
and activities that are in line with Council Decisions and SADC priorities.

F.

SADC – African Development Bank Cooperation

The SADC Secretariat negotiated and concluded the Protocol of Agreement between SADC and
AfDB, and the Tripartite Agreement between SADC, AfDB and WHO worth Six Million Units of
Account (UA 6,000,000) signed in August 2020, to assist in financing the Support to the COVID19 Pandemic Crisis Response in the SADC Region. The objective of the agreement is to support
the procurement and distribution of medical supplies and equipment in response to COVID-19
Pandemic Crisis in the SADC Region.
In addition, SADC-AfDB Cooperation continues to implement activities that are in line with the
Multinational Protocol of Agreement between SADC and AfDB signed in August 2019 (UA 1.5
million), to enable implementation of the project “Sustainable Financing of Regional Infrastructure
and Industrial Projects in SADC” and help accelerate SADC Regional Integration Agenda through
the following work streams:

G.

SADC – ICP Dialogue Platform

The SADC-ICP Dialogue remains a critical platform for engaging with International Cooperating
Partners. This is in part to ensure that development cooperation is undertaken in a coherent
manner that promotes ownership, accountability, harmonization, mutual trust and respect, and
transparency in the implementation of regional integration/development initiatives.
The Secretariat, in accordance with the provisions of the Windhoek Declaration (2006) and the
SADC-ICP Partnership Statement (2012) convened a SADC-ICP Dialogue Platform Meeting on
20 November 2020 (preceded by a SADC Double Troika Preparatory Meeting held on 19
November 2020). The Dialogue Platform discussed the Vision 2050 and RISDP 2020-2030 as
approved by the SADC Council of August 2020, Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic in the SADC
Region, Food Security Outlook, COVID-19 Recovery (including green recovery initiatives) and
considered an update on the work of SADC-ICP Thematic Groups.
In an effort to enhance the operations of Thematic Groups and as guided by the SADC-ICP
Dialogue Platform Meeting, the Secretariat commissioned an Assessment on the Operations of
Thematic Groups in December 2020. The assessment seeks to propose standardized
approaches in conducting the business of Thematic Groups and share best practices, and also
to undertake assessments on the impact of COVID-19 on the work of Thematic Groups and
provide recommendations for mitigation. A draft assessment report was produced in March 2021
and is still under internal review.

VIII. Change Management
A.

Good Governance

Good governance arrangements are pivotal to ensure that the Secretariat’s operations are
properly managed in a transparent and accountable manner to enable achievement of objectives.
Summit, Council of Ministers and other Statutory Meetings of various Committees and Subcommittees were held to provide strategic direction in implementing key programmes and
activities, through the provision of timely and quality information by the Secretariat to inform
decisions made by the Governance Structures. The key decisions are prioritized and implemented
accordingly. Activities are also monitored to ensure that they contribute effectively to the
achievement of the RISDP outputs. Furthermore, the meetings were also held to provide direction
and oversight on the Secretariat's performance on key operations, financial management and
reporting, internal controls and risk management systems, compliance with applicable laws,
policies and regulations

B.

Organizational Health and Change Management

Risk Management
Fraud and Corruption Management Policy was approved by March 2021 Council of Ministers,
which forms a key part of the fraud and corruption deterrence strategy by demonstrating the
Secretariat's commitment in combating fraud and corruption. The Secretariat continued to
improve on its risk maturity as the risk management processes are embedded in organisational
processes of planning, budgeting, controlling activities and decision-making.
62

-----------------------Page 62 End-----------------------

Audit
Value adding audits were conducted comprising of advisory services, performance and IT audits,
which contributed to improvement in operational efficiency and effectiveness, management of
risks and compliance with laws and regulations. Emerging risks such as economic risks, staff
wellness, cyber security and data protection were identified and Secretariat developed risk
mitigation measures to address these risks to minimize impact on the Secretariat's objectives.
Cost savings opportunities were identified, a data privacy and protection policy was
recommended, then developed and approved by Council.
Based on the audits completed the overall opinion is that the control environment is fairly effective
thus controls are generally established and functioning, with some improvements required to
provide reasonable assurance that objectives will be met.

IX. Implementation of Financial Management Framework
Budget and Finance controls within the Secretariat are carried out within the Financial
Management framework, which are intended to deliver an effective and efficient risk advisory
service and support the Secretariat to fulfill its fiduciary responsibility. Financial regulations,
standing orders and rules for the management of the affairs of SADC are enacted by the Council
of Ministers under Article 30 of the Treaty of SADC. These provide a consistent and
comprehensive legal framework for Financial Management. As required by financial regulations,
budget execution and oversight control is aimed at achieving, among others, adherence to good
corporate governance principles; and ensuring that risk management measures, including the
SADC risk management policy and framework, are in place.
The Secretariat continues to provide prudent financial management in line with the Financial
Regulations, International Public Sector Accounting Standards, Financing Agreements, among
other Regulatory Frameworks. Further, it adheres to sound governance principles and internal
control measures to ensure efficient and effective implementation of the approved Corporate
Plans and Budget.
The approved total budget for the 2020/21 Financial Year amounting to US$91,719,237, was
funded as follows: US$58,063,214 (63%) by the Member States and US$33,658,023 (37%) by
International Cooperating Partners.
The total budget of US$91,719,237, was appropriated as follows:
(i)

US$51,796,387 (56%) towards Programmes [Member States: US$20,258,443
(39%) and ICPs: US$31,537,944 (61%)];

(ii)

US$23,617,863 (26%) towards Support Services [Member States: US$21,497,781
(91%) and ICPs: US$2,120,082 (9%)];

(iii)

US$2,761,537 (3%) towards Capital Expenditure (Capex) [Member States:
US$2,761,537 (100%)]; and

(iv)

US$13,543,450 (15%) towards transfer to the SADC Special Funds; [Member
States: US$13,543,450 (100%)].
63

-----------------------Page 63 End-----------------------

The highlights of the unaudited interim performance report for the 2020/21 Financial Year are as
follows:
Revenue:
The actual total revenue amounted to US$60,203,633 (66%) of the revenue budget of
US$91,719,237. [Member States: Actual revenue of US$48,660,265 (84%) against a revenue
budget of US$58,063,214; and ICPs: Actual revenue of US$11,543,368 (34%) against a revenue
budget of US$33,658,023.
(i)

Annual Member States contributions of US$7,230,807.91 were in arrears as of 31
March 2020 [Comoros:US$5,044,380.00, Eswatini:US$2,186,427.91]; and

(ii)

The revenue rate of 34% on International Cooperating Partners’ contributions was
mainly due to the negative impact of COVID19 pandemic experienced in 2020/21
Financial year, delays in the replenishments of funds, and delays in concluding
procurement processes due to non-responsive bidders on Service Contracts for
the Programmes.

Expenditure:
Overall actual expenditure of US$43,937,680 (56%) was recorded against a total budget of
US$78,175,791 excluding transfers to Contingency Fund and Special Funds:
(i)
(ii)
(iii)
(iv)
(v)

actual expenditure of US$32,448,694 (73%) against a budget of US$44,517,768
funded by the Member States; and
actual expenditure of US$11,488,986 (34%) against the budget of US$33,658,023
funded by International Development Cooperation.
actual expenditure for Programmes was US$23,698,026 (47%) against a budget
of US$50,876,594;
actual expenditure for Support Services was US$20,239,653 (74%) against a
budget of US$27,299,197;
Project Disbursements of US$7,826,402 to the Member States and
consultancies/service providers was made as follows;
a)
b)

US$1,505,105 disbursement to Member States towards the Trade Related
Facility (TRF) Project; and
US$126,912 disbursement to Member States towards the Global Climate
Change Alliance Plus GCCA+ Project

(vi)

US$4,405,564 disbursement to Member States towards the Project Preparation
Development Facility (PPDF) program under the management of the Development
Bank of Southern Africa (DBSA);
(vii) US$909,924 disbursement to consultancies towards the Support to Improving the
Investment and Business Environment (SIBE) Project; and
(viii) US$878,897 disbursement to service providers towards the Trade Facilitation
Program (TFP).

64

-----------------------Page 64 End-----------------------

The overall expenditure utilisation rate of 56% excludes an amount of US$7.8 million pertaining
to project funded disbursements to beneficiary Member States and consultancies yet to be
justified.
Analysis of Expenditure Variances:
The budget utilization for Member States funds of 64% on programme activities and 80% on
support activities under Member States’ funding is mainly attributed to the impact of the COVID19 pandemic. In August 2020, the Secretariat proactively, undertook an exercise to review the
annual plan and reprogram activities that could be undertaken while under the various COVID-19
restrictions. Activities that could be undertaken using virtual means were prioritized while those
requiring physical meetings or travel were either cancelled or postponed. The review was
conducted under the assumption that operations would return to normal in the foreseeable future.
However, the effects and impact of the pandemic continued throughout the year, forcing
Directorates and Units to cancel or postpone some planned activities during the second half of
the year under review. This resulted in significant cost reductions than initially budgeted, owing to
no travel, per diem, and conference costs. In addition, delays in the procurement process of
service contracts caused by the non-responsiveness of bidders further reduced the level of
expenditures than budgeted.
Furthermore, the budget utilization of International Cooperating Partners (ICP) funds: Budget
utilization of 36% on Programme activities and 16% on Support Activities achieved has been due
the COVID-19 pandemic which affected the implementation of International Cooperating Partner
funded activities during the year under review. Major meetings and workshops were either
postponed, cancelled, or conducted virtually. This resulted in a low utilization of budgeted funds.
The procurement process was also affected by the non-responsiveness of bidders in the
procurement process of service contracts for programmes, in particular on the “Support to
Improving the Business and Investment” (SIBE), “Global Climate Change Alliance Plus”
(GCCA+), IICB “Sustainable Financing of Infrastructure and Industrial projects” programmes in
SADC supported by the AfDB.

X.

Challenges and Mitigation Measures

The Secretariat faced a number of technical and operational challenges during the 2020/21
Financial Year which were primarily centered around prevalence of COVID-19 pandemic as
follows:
(i)

The migration to virtual operation with a view to address challenges posed by
COVID-19, while ensuring business continuity resulted in an increase of virtual
meetings, resulting into increased demands on ICT, in terms of technology, human
resources, and financial resources. The Secretariat is assessing the situation while
using lessons learnt to come up with an effective and efficiency plan and approach;

(ii)

Virtual operations also resulted in activities that requires face to face interventions
not to be implemented, resulting in under-utilisation of allocated budgets. In
addition, whereas, the migration to virtual operation enabled the Secretariat to
implement the planned activates to the tune of 85% implementation rate. Budget
utilization remained at 58%. Nonetheless, a cost saving exercise was conducted
and these resources were re-focused and allocated to other important activities,
65

-----------------------Page 65 End-----------------------

including funding of SADC Observation Missions, and operationalization of the
Mechanism to honour SADC Founders.
(iii)

There were delays in the signing of legal instruments adopted by Summit during
the virtual meeting in August 2020 which negatively affect the ratification process,
and in turn delay entry into force of the legal instruments. In this regard,
arrangements have been put in place for hybrid meetings, whereby the August
2021 Summit will be held face to face to allow Heads of State and Government to
sign the Legal instruments;

(iv)

There was slow progress in the ratification of legal instruments such as (1) Protocol
on Industry, (2) Protocol on Services, and (3) Tripartite Free Trade Agreement. The
Secretariat has continued to remind and urge Member States to ratify through
official letters and during meetings;

(v)

Performance was also affected by delay in recruitments. Notwithstanding, measure
put in place by the Secretariat to address delays in recruitments, the challenges
remain, mainly due to quota points requirements, whereby the Secretariat has to
undertake multiple recruitment processes for same positons (from advertisements
to interviews);

(vi)

Verifications of expenditures under support provided to Member States under the
Trade Related Facility Project were delayed due to COVID-19 travel restrictions.
To minimize the negative impact, expenditure verifications were conducted using
virtual means to the extent possible.

(vii) The roll-out of the Electronic Certificate of Rules of Origin (e-CoO) System pilots in
Member States was postponed due to COVID-19 pandemic restrictions. This
delayed the finalisation of technical e-CoO System design and system
configuration and resources in some Member States. Efforts are underway to
mobilise resources for technical support to Member States, including creating more
synergies with other ICPs. A new launch plan for the e-CoO pilots will be
established with clear date of launch agreed.
(viii) Audits that required physical verification of assets, projects and expenditures
incurred could not be fully undertaken in line with the Council Decision of March
2020 due to COVID-19 travel restrictions. Virtual Audits were conducted. However,
some verification exercises and procedures were not undertaken reducing the
scope of the audit assignment.
(ix)

Financing of programmes to achieve the aspirations of the regional integration
agenda is among the major challenges. Signing and ratification of the Agreement
of the Operationalisation of the SADC Regional Development Fund remains very
important for sustainable financing of regional programmes and projects.

XI. Conclusions
The significant achievement attained during the 2020/21 Financial Year marked continued
commitment by the Secretariat towards achievement of the aspirations enshrined in the RISDP
66

-----------------------Page 66 End-----------------------

towards regional integration. This is amidst the prolonged and lingering challenges brought about
COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic inevitably forced the Secretariat, and indeed the Member
States to critically review and reflect on strategies and measures to ensure continuity and
implementation of planned regional interventions.
The region embarked on virtual approach to effectively coordinate meetings and capacity building
electronically. The approach has inevitably increased attendance and participation of Member
States and key stakeholders. It has brought together public and private sector stakeholders and
has further proved to stimulate interactive dialogue/debate among them, an achievement which
remained a challenge for a long time. Furthermore, the use of ICT collaboration platforms such
as SADC extranet and the new SADC shared collaboration platform greatly eased the
collaboration between participants as they serve as a central repository where all documents and
any new updates could be accessed and downloaded by all.
Setting up of Covid-19 crisis management mechanisms by the Secretariat in order to survive the
uncertainty posed by the COVID-19 pandemic remains critical in the foreseeable future which
remains bleak. Much as virtual Policy meetings enable the Secretariat to continue achieving its
objectives and securing requisite decisions to enable it to execute its mandate, there are certain
matters and issues that strictly require consideration of, or action by, face to face Policy meetings
such as signing of legal instruments. It is important, therefore, to underscore the importance of
virtual approach while appreciating that it remains an interim measure or an alternative at best
and that there is need to revert to the physical operation approach after COVID-19.
The small Member States Task Teams were instrumental in achieving majority of the planned
interventions, more so during the 2020/21 Financial Year. The approach proved to be effective in
ensuring continuity in implementation at Member States level mainly because it proved easier to
coordinate a smaller group of people focused on a particular objective as opposed to coordinating
large groups of people. The Secretariat will indeed continue to use this approach towards
achieving desired results and outputs.
In conclusion, while the Secretariat in collaboration with Member States, Partners and
Stakeholders has achieved significant progress across the RISDP priorities, the COVID-19
pandemic has, to a large degree, exposed technological and technical gaps at the Secretariat
and Member States which ranged from the quality of network connectivity to the necessary
equipment for Member States to actively and consistently participate in statutory and policy
meetings. The pandemic has thus taught the Secretariat and the Member States the importance
of staying up-to-date with new technologies and the need to have good ICT continuity processes
in place to adjust to challenges to avoid the organisations from being adversely impacted. It is
therefore important to introduce new technologies and platforms that will enable the region to
operate independently and readily.
