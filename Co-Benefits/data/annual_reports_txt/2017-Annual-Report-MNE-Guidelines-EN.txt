INTRODUCTION AND EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Introduction and Executive summary
Responsible business conduct: rising expectations and demands
Responsible business conduct (RBC) is increasingly relevant for the global economic
agenda, in particular, for dealing with the downsides of globalisation and promoting
the positive contribution of businesses to sustainable development. In 2017, the
OECD's work on RBC, based on the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises
(the Guidelines), was recognised in a variety of high-level political contexts.
In July 2017, G20 Leaders acknowledged the importance of sharing the benefits of
globalisation and committed to foster “the implementation of labour, social and
environmental standards and human rights in line with internationally recognised
frameworks”, including the OECD Guidelines. The G20 Leaders' Declaration also
expressed "support [for] access to remedy and, where applicable, non-judicial
grievance mechanisms, such as the National Contact Points for the OECD MNE
Guidelines (NCPs)", and underline[d] the responsibility of businesses to exercise due
diligence."1 The ministerial declaration entitled “Towards an Inclusive Future:
Shaping the World of Work” adopted earlier by G20 Labour and Employment
Ministers on 18-19 May 2017, recognised the role of the Guidelines, NCPs and due
diligence.2 These developments build on recognition of RBC under the 2016 Chinese
G20 Presidency.
The 2017 OECD Ministerial Council Statement, entitled "Making globalisation
work: better lives for all", prominently featured OECD work on RBC, expressing
strong support for the Guidelines, sector-specific due diligence guidance and the
NCPs. Members committed "to having fully functioning and adequately resourced
National Contact Points, and to undertake a peer learning, capacity building exercise
or a peer review by 2021, with the aim of having all countries peer reviewed by
2023." They encouraged "the OECD to develop a set of general due diligence
guidelines that can be applied to any sector." 3
Heightened expectations of OECD work on RBC have also been driven by industry,
consumers, and developments in legal and regulatory requirements. Examples of
legislative developments in 2017 are the French Duty of Vigilance
legislation requiring large companies to implement a due diligence plan, as well as
the European Union (EU) regulation stipulating supply chain due diligence
obligations for importers of certain minerals. In addition, the demand for more
transparency and information on how companies deal with human rights,
environmental, social and other "non-financial" issues, has rapidly grown. One
particular trend is the increasing demand for information on how companies are
identifying and addressing impacts in their supply chains. Investors have also been
facing increasing expectations to manage climate and social risks in their portfolios.

8 │ INTRODUCTION AND EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
In 2017, OECD's activities to support the global level playing field on RBC, and
promote effective implementation of the Guidelines, have centred on three pillars of
work. First, support for NCPs, who are tasked with promoting the Guidelines and
providing a platform to address issues related to their implementation. Another
important aspect of implementation is the provision of guidance to companies on
how to apply the due diligence recommendations of the Guidelines in practice,
through supply chains, in specific sectors. Third, the OECD is working with
governments to design and implement policies to ensure an enabling environment for
RBC, and to promote policy coherence.

National Contact Points for Responsible Business Conduct
With the formal adherence of Ukraine on 15 March 2017,4 and Kazakhstan on
20 June 2017,5 48 Adherents have now committed to establish an NCP to promote
the Guidelines and contribute to the resolution of issues relating to implementation of
the Guidelines in specific instances. This unique implementation mechanism
distinguishes the Guidelines from other international RBC instruments. A total of 47
Adherents have an NCP in place, the exception is Tunisia which does not appear to
have an NCP contact, website or any NCP-related activity.
In 2017, NCPs closed 34 specific instances and received 28 new specific instances.
Of the closed specific instances: 12 went to mediation and agreement was reached
between parties in eight specific instances through the NCP and, in another two
instances, in parallel to the specific instance procedure, accounting for 83% of the 12
specific instances where mediation occurred (compared to 60% in 2016)). In some
cases, agreements reached among parties included direct remedy to the submitters, or
changes to a company's operations and policies to mitigate impacts. For example, a
specific instance filed at the Dutch NCP involving former employees of Bralima (a
subsidiary of Heineken) resulted in financial compensation to 168 employees, the
remedy they had been seeking for nearly 17 years, and important changes to
Heineken’s human rights due diligence policy. Another specific instance was
submitted to the French NCP involving a labour dispute at the Westin Long Beach
Hotel, which Natixis (a French investment bank) had a business relationship with
through a complex investment chain. Through the NCP's engagement with Natixis
and its subsidiary, the labour dispute was resolved and the union was recognised by
the new hotel operators.
In 2017, 40% (8) of the concluded specific instances resulted in some changes to
company policy or operations to better meet recommendations of the Guidelines
(compared to 37% in 2016). For example, in the context of the specific instance filed
with the Swiss NCP regarding construction of facilities for the FIFA 2022 World
Cup in Qatar, and as a result of the agreement reached between the Fédération
Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) and the Building and Wood Workers’
International, , FIFA agreed to implement several measures, including: strengthening
its human rights policy, carrying out a human rights due diligence process throughout
the supply chain, and enhancing grievance and oversight mechanisms.
In 2017, 18 NCPs (38% of all NCPs) received specific instance submissions.. The
NCPs of Denmark and the Netherlands received the highest number of submissions
(four submissions each), followed by the NCPs of France, Italy, Spain and the United
States, which received two submissions each. The financial and manufacturing

INTRODUCTION AND EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

sectors continued to be the most prevalent in specific instances and the human rights
chapter was again the most often cited.
During 2017, 33 NCPs created a promotional plan for the Guidelines (compared to
25 in 2016), and 41 NCPs either held or attended promotional events, (compared to
35 in 2016). Most governments have made their NCP visible, e.g., via a dedicated
website. A total of 35 NCPs published information on their website on procedures
and explaining the specific instance process. There are currently four adhering
governments that do not have a website in place on the Guidelines or the NCP.
Furthermore, three NCPs did not attend the NCP meetings in either June or
November (compared to five in 2016) and three NCPs did not report on their 2017
activities (compared to two in 2016).
In 2017, the programme of NCP peer reviews continued with finalisation of peer
reviews by the NCPs of Italy, Switzerland and France, and on-site visits for peer
reviews by the NCPs of Germany, Chile, the United States and Austria. In addition,
two capacity-building missions took place to provide support for the new NCPs in
Kazakhstan and Ukraine.

Due diligence to implement the Guidelines
In 2017, expectations of due diligence for RBC are increasingly being reflected in
international and national policy and regulation. In March 2017, France adopted
legislation requiring certain large companies to prepare, implement and publish a due
diligence plan to prevent human rights abuses? and environmental impacts associated
with their operations and supply chains.6 While regulatory directives can present a
strong incentive for companies to carry out due diligence, a proliferation of
expectations at a domestic level can create challenges for businesses operating
globally as they may already be subject to various other international expectations.
Throughout 2017, extensive consultations were carried out to prepare and revise the
draft OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Business Conduct, which will
be relevant for all sectors of the economy. The Guidance can help promote a
common understanding on due diligence for businesses subject to various domestic
obligations and international instruments. It will be completed and embodied in an
OECD Recommendation of the Council to be adopted by ministers at the 2018
Ministerial Council Meeting (MCM).
Over the course of 2017, regulatory developments and market dynamics have
supported implementation of the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible
Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas (the "OECD
Minerals Guidance") in new geographies, minerals, and industries. In May 2017, the
EU adopted a regulation that will require importers of tin, tantalum, tungsten and
gold minerals and metals to carry out supply chain due diligence aligned with the
OECD Minerals Guidance.7 Other developments include stronger legislation and
government-backed industry standards, particularly in mineral processing and
consuming regions, such as China and India, as well as increased awareness and
sensitisation of local stakeholders on issues relating to artisanal and small-scale
mining in Colombia and West Africa. The increased demand for minerals, such as
cobalt − which is critical for development of batteries and largely sourced from
conflict-affected and high-risk areas ─ has also cultivated greater awareness of the
OECD Minerals Guidance.

10 │ INTRODUCTION AND EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Building on the foundations of previous sectoral work and based on the experiences
and knowledge shared during prior OECD Roundtables on Responsible Garment
Supply Chains, the OECD launched the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for
Responsible Supply Chains in the Garment and Footwear Sector on 8 February
2017.8 This Guidance responds to the OECD Ministerial Communiqué on
Responsible Business Conduct adopted on 26 June 2014,9 and the G7 Leaders’
Declaration adopted on 7-8 June 2015, in Schloss Elmau, which welcomed
international efforts to promulgate industry-wide due diligence standards in the
textile and ready-made garment sector. The Guidance was approved by the
Investment Committee on 14 January 2017 and was embodied in the
Recommendation of the Council on the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for
Responsible Supply Chains in the Garment and Footwear Sector, adopted in June
2017. A key component of OECD’s work to support implementation of the OECD
Garment Guidance in 2017 was building the industry’s awareness and capacity on
due diligence, supporting convergence and alignment of various initiatives, and
engaging with key producing regions. To this end, an Alignment Assessment Tool
was developed in 2017 to help companies and initiatives assess their activities and
standards against the OECD Garment Guidance. In 2017, the OECD worked towards
the conclusion of a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with the China National
Apparel and Textile Council (CNTAC) to develop and implement a Chinese
language Guidance aligned with the OECD Guidance (signed in January 2018). The
OECD also laid the groundwork for a partnership with the Indian textile industry and
global brands to develop an Indian-driven response to support responsible sourcing.
In 2017, the OECD paper on Responsible Business Conduct for Institutional
Investors was formally launched and broadly disseminated. Awareness raising events
and workshops in the United Kingdom, Norway, Denmark, Belgium, Canada and
France informed practitioners about implementing the paper’s recommendations. In
addition, trainings were organised with NCPs to help them build a stronger technical
understanding of the sector, which in turn could support them when handling specific
instances implicating institutional investors. The OECD launched the second phase
of its work on RBC in the financial sector, which is focused on corporate lending
activities and underwriting. This project identifies due diligence approaches for
banks to ensure they avoid and address risks related to their clients’ RBC. There is
currently no broadly recognised standard on environmental and social due diligence
for general corporate lending and underwriting, although these transactions represent
the majority of financing activity by banks.
The implementation programme of the OECD-FAO Guidance for Responsible
Agricultural Supply Chains10 is also developing. Following a specific call by the G7
Agricultural Ministers in 2017 to promote implementation of the Guidance,11 the
OECD Secretariat has been engaged in a number of awareness raising activities to
prepare for the initial pilot programme. The pilot, launched in early 2018, aims to
support enterprises in implementing the OECD-FAO Guidance and should serve as a
voluntary, collective-learning exercise.

Government policies in support of Responsible Business Conduct
Besides supporting NCPs and enhancing business capacity to implement due
diligence for RBC, the OECD's work has also focussed on promoting policy
coherence with respect to RBC in economic, environmental and social policies. In

INTRODUCTION AND EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

the context of global challenges concerning climate, poverty, and sustainable
development, governments are increasingly committed to designing and
implementing a strong policy framework that supports and promotes RBC. This
involves establishing and enforcing a legal framework in the areas covered by the
Guidelines, and providing recognition and incentives to businesses that behave in
line with RBC standards. It also requires governments to observe RBC standards in
their role of economic actor (e.g. through public procurement, export credits, and
development finance), and as owners of enterprises.
The OECD covers a wide range of these policy areas and has set international
standards relating to economic policies which have a bearing on RBC. The growing
work on RBC policies has therefore led to an increased number of horizontal efforts
through policy analysis and advice, but also legal instruments (Council
Recommendations) which recognise governments' responsibility to create an
enabling environment for RBC. Chapter 3 provides an overview of policy areas
relevant to RBC and maps relevant OECD work.
One way for governments to coordinate efforts on RBC is to elaborate National
Action Plans (NAP) on Business and Human Rights and/or Responsible Business
Conduct. Many NAPs provide an overarching policy framework for RBC and aim to
ensure coordination and coherence within the government among all relevant policies
relating to RBC (including investment, procurement, export credits, SOEs, etc.). As
of December 2017, 20 countries, all of which are Adherents to the OECD Guidelines,
have adopted a NAP. In addition, a number of governments are currently in the
process of developing a NAP, e.g. Argentina, Japan, Mexico, Peru and Thailand. The
scope of NAPs varies by country. Some go beyond the theme of business and human
rights by encompassing the environment (for example, France and Italy) and RBC
more generally, such as the United States and Switzerland, which developed a NAP
on Business and Human Rights and on RBC.
The 2017 Roundtable for Policy-Makers, held as part of the Global Forum on
Responsible Business Conduct, provided an opportunity for policy makers to
exchange experiences and discuss ways to effectively design and implement policies
to enable and promote RBC. This included discussions on NAPs organised jointly
with the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights
(UNOHCHR), as well as a deep dive into public procurement and economic
diplomacy (including export credits).

Outreach and cooperation with partners
Another important way to promote the Guidelines and enable RBC is outreach and
cooperation with Partners and non-Adherents. Co-operation has continued with a
number of key non-Adherents, either through regional, country, or sector
programmes, as well as the annual Global Forum on Responsible Business Conduct
(GFRBC) and sector-specific forums and roundtables, such as the OECD Forum on
Responsible Minerals Supply Chains and the OECD Forum on Due Diligence in the
Garment and Footwear Sector.
Starting in 2018, the OECD will be working with key non-Adherents in Asia to
promote peer learning and co-operation as part of a three-year project, developed by
the EU together with the International Labour Organization (ILO) and OECD, on
responsible supply chains in Asia. A similar project in Latin America and the

Caribbean is expected to start in the second half of 2018. These projects will address
all three pillars of work under the Guidelines, strengthening of NCPs (where
relevant), working with business to implement due diligence and enhancing
government policies to enable and promote RBC. These regional projects will be
important vehicles for outreach on the Guidelines in the following years (see
Annex 5 for more information).

Chapter 1
National Contact Points for Responsible Business Conduct

Background
All Adherents commit to establishing an NCP to promote the Guidelines and
contribute to the resolution of issues relating to the implementation of the Guidelines
in specific instances. This unique implementation mechanism distinguishes the
Guidelines from other international RBC instruments. Of the 48 Adherents, a total of
47 have an NCP in place, the exception is Tunisia which does not appear to have an
NCP contact, a website or any NCP-related activity.
This chapter focuses on the activities of NCPs during the period January–December
2017. It is based on responses to the annual reporting questionnaires submitted by the
NCPs covering activities up to 31 December 2017.
The chapter begins by providing an overview of closed specific instances and new
ones submitted within the reporting period, and addresses trends in handling specific
instances during that period. This is followed by a section addressing the current
structures of NCPs, including the involvement of ministries and relevant staff and
financial resources. Following this, the chapter focuses on NCP activities conducted
in 2017. An overview of NCPs in 2017 is provided in Annex 2.
1.1. Overview of specific instances handled during the reporting period
In 2017, 34 specific instances were closed by NCPs and 28 new specific instances
were submitted. Closed specific instances includes those submitted during and prior
to 2017. The sections below give an overview of outcomes of closed specific
instances and trends identified for new specific instances submitted.

1.1.1.

Overview and key outcomes of closed specific instances

A total of 34 specific instances were closed in the reporting period: 29 were already
in progress as of January 2017 and five new ones which were submitted during 2017.
(See Table 2 for an overview of closed specific instances in 2017). Closed specific
instances refer to both concluded cases and those that are not accepted for further
examination (see Box 1). Of the specific instances in progress as of January 2017, 18
were submitted prior to 2016.
Out of the 34 specific instances closed in this period, 20 were concluded (59%) and
12 were not accepted (35%). An additional two were withdrawn by the submitter
prior to the initial assessment by the NCP (6%).

Box 1. Terminology for the status of specific instances

Specific instances closed during the year includes both specific instances that were
concluded during the year and those that were not accepted during the year.
1. Specific instances concluded during the year are those that the NCP found to
merit further examination after the initial assessment and that have
subsequently been closed. For such specific instances the NCP will have
offered its “good offices” (e.g. mediation/conciliation) to both parties.
2. Specific instances not accepted during the year were those that the NCP
found did not merit further examination and therefore were closed.
Specific instances that are in progress are those that are not yet closed. These will
include submissions received by the NCP and under consideration, along with those
accepted by the NCP.

Of the 20 concluded specific instances, 12 underwent mediation which in eight cases
resulted in some form of agreement between the parties through the NCP process12
and two which resulted in some form of agreement between the parties in parallel to
the NCP process. Two of the 12 specific instances that went to mediation did not
result in agreement despite the engagement of both parties in the process.

For the remaining eight concluded specific instances, mediation was refused by the
company involved in six specific instances. In one specific instance, mediation was
refused by the submitter due to disagreement with the terms of the confidentiality
agreement proposed by the NCP. Mediation was not offered in one concluded
specific instance as the NCP found that offering a facilitated dialogue solely between
the submitters and the company would not contribute to the direct resolution of the
issues.

1.1.2 Agreement between parties
Agreement was reached between parties in eight specific instances through the NCP
and, in another two instances, in parallel to the specific instance procedure,
accounting for 83% of all concluded specific instances where mediation occurred (12
specific instances). This is an increase from 2016, where some form of agreement
was reached in nine specific instances accounting for 60% of all concluded specific
instances where mediation occurred (15 specific instances).
In some cases, agreements reached among the parties included direct remedy to the
submitters, or changes to a company's operations and policies to mitigate impacts
(see Box 2).
Box 2. Remedy through the National Contact Point mechanism

Heineken, Bralima and former employees of Bralima: In December 2015, the
Dutch NCP received a submission from three individuals involving Heineken, a
Dutch multinational and its subsidiary Bralima, operating in the Democratic
Republic of Congo (DRC). The three individuals stated that Bralima had not
observed the Guidelines in the dismissals of 168 former employees in the DRC
between the year 1999 and 2000.
The NCP accepted the specific instance and organised two mediation meetings, one
in Uganda and one in Paris to facilitate the participation of the submitters. The
mediation concluded with an agreement between the parties and the specific instance
was concluded in August 2017. As part of the agreement Heineken agreed to provide
compensation to the workers. Heineken also indicated that it will draw up a policy
and guidelines on how to conduct business and operate in volatile and conflictaffected countries.
The parties noted that involvement in the specific instance has improved
relationships between the company and submitters and also been important in
signalling expectations with respect to corporate accountability to other enterprises
operating in the region. The NCP was asked by the parties to monitor the next steps
agreed to by the parties.
Natixis-NGAM and UNITE HERE: In September 2016, the French NCP received
a specific instance submitted by the American trade union Unite Here Local 11
regarding the activities of the French bank Natixis and one of its asset managers
Natixis Global Asset Manager (NGAM). The submission concerned a complex
investment chain and business relationships in the United States and France. The
union submitting the complaint noted a social conflict taking place at the Westin
Long Beach Hotel, and alleged violations of freedom of association, collective

bargaining and working hours. This hotel was operated by an American hospitality
conglomerate and owned indirectly by an American institutional investor. AEW
Capital Management, a US subsidiary of Natixis and NAGM, provided asset
management advisory services to the hotel owner.
The French NCP offered its good offices, engaging with the parties and offering to
facilitate a dialogue between them. In September 2017, the NCP welcomed the
results obtained: the hotel was sold to another owner, a new operator was chosen, and
unionisation was agreed to. The NCP closed its good offices and drafted the final
decision in consultation with the parties.
The parties recognised the NCP’s role in contributing to solving the two-year long
labour dispute at the Westin Long Beach hotel noting that “as a result of the NCP’s
constructive engagement with Natixis, the company changed its approach and carried
out effective due diligence measures by engaging with its subsidiary to help resolve
the complaint.” And “[I]t is without question that the French NCP’s critical work on
the case, in mediating dialogue with Natixis and NGAM, was central to the
outcome.”13 The NCP final report details steps of the NCP actions and gives a
substantive analysis of the due diligence issues raised in the specific instance.
Ansell Limited and IndustriALL Global Union: In December 2013, the Australian
NCP received a submission from IndustriALL on behalf of trade unions based in Sri
Lanka and Malaysia. It alleged that some Ansell employees may have suffered
significant health issues as a result of workplace contaminants and that Ansell acted
inappropriately in relation to its handling of deteriorating working conditions. The
Australian NCP, and representatives acting on behalf of the NCP, conducted
successful mediation over four meetings between August 2014 and November 2015.
Subsequent dialogue occurred directly between the NCP and two parties during
2016, resolving all outstanding issues and concluding with a memorandum of
understanding (MOU) signed between the parties in August 2016. The specific
instance was concluded by the Australian NCP in June 2017.
The MOU formalises an agreement between Ansell and IndustriALL regarding terms
for rehiring employees and expectations of professional business conduct between
both parties.
More recently, IndustriALL Global Union requested the Australian NCP to follow up
Ansell Limited’s adherence to their agreement.

Eight specific instances concluded in 2017 resulted in some changes to company
policy or operations to better meet recommendations of the Guidelines, amounting to
40% of all concluded specific instances (compared to 37% in 2016). These changes
included strengthening corporate policies on human rights, improving due diligence
processes, as well as improving reporting processes and transparency standards (see
Box 3 for examples.)

Box 3. Changes to company policies through specific instance procedures

Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) and Building and
Wood Workers’ International (BWI): In May 2015, the Swiss NCP received a
submission from BWI regarding alleged human rights violations of migrant workers
related to the construction of facilities for the FIFA 2022 World Cup in Qatar. The
NCP offered mediation to the parties which resulted in agreement on May 2017
between the parties on a detailed action plan for promoting decent and safe work
conditions for migrant construction workers. The agreed plan included actions on:


A strengthened human rights policy;



A human rights due diligence process, extending through supply chains and
subcontracts;



Robust processes for monitoring labour conditions, including joint labour
inspections; and



A strengthened grievance mechanism and oversight/advisory body

The parties agreed they would send a report to the Swiss NCP about the progress
made regarding the agreement and to meet to discuss whether further follow up is
necessary.

Type of companies involved in specific instances

The 34 specific instances closed in 2017 primarily involved large enterprises
(defined as companies employing over 250 employees).14 In 11 specific instances,
there is no information on the size of the company involved, as some final statements
do not identify the company’s name..
Companies were mostly publically listed entities representing 37% (13 specific
instances) of all closed specific instances, followed by privately held companies
(18% or specific instances). Two of the specific instances involved state-owned
enterprises (SOEs), one involved a non-profit organisation involved in commercial
activity (World Wildlife Federation) and one involved a sports association
(Fédération Internationale de Football Association). Information on the identity of
31% of the companies (11 specific instances) is unavailable either because this was
kept confidential in final statements or the relevant final statements have not yet been
published (see Figure 2).The numbers are similar to those reported in 2016.
Four specific instances closed in this period involved Fortune 500 companies.15 The
headquarters companies involved in specific instances cover 16 countries. The
headquarter location of companies implicated in nine specific instances is
unavailable either because this was kept confidential in final statements or the
relevant final statements have not yet been published (see Table 1).

Final statements

The Procedural Guidance of the Guidelines provides that NCPs will "at the
conclusion of the [specific instance] procedures and after consultation with the
parties involved, make the results of procedures publically available […]".16In
particular, the Commentary on the Implementation Procedures of the OECD
Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises provides that when the NCP "decides that
the issues raised in the specific instance do not merit further consideration, it will
make a statement publicly available after consultations with the parties involved” and
if the parties fail to reach agreement, or if the NCP finds that one or more of the
parties to the specific instance is unwilling to engage or to participate in good faith,
the NCP will make recommendations as appropriate in the public statement.
ANNUAL REPORT ON THE OECD GUIDELINES FOR MULTINATIONAL ENTERPRISES 2017 © OECD 2018

-----------------------Page 20 End-----------------------

1. NATIONAL CONTACT POINTS FOR RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS CONDUCT

Determinations can be made by NCPs to indicate that a company has, or has not,
observed the recommendations of the Guidelines, however this is not required by the
Procedural Guidance. Statements constitute an important tool to support the
effectiveness of the Guidelines and enhance transparency, accountability and
visibility of NCPs. Indeed, substantiated decisions, recommendations and
determinations can help companies and stakeholders understand the Guidelines more
concretely and what steps, actions, policy measures they can take to fully observe
them.
Final statements were published for 27 of the 34 (79%) specific instances that were
closed in 2017. Out of the seven specific instances for which final statements were
not published, one specific instance was accepted for further examination and
concluded, one was withdrawn prior to the initial assessment and the remaining 5
were not accepted for further examination.
Of the 20 final statements published for concluded cases, 14 (70%) included
recommendations.17 This is an increase from 2016 where 59% of final statements
published for concluded cases included recommendations. Recommendations are
especially useful in cases where parties have not been able to engage or reach
agreement. Determinations of whether an enterprise observed or did not observe the
Guidelines were included in four of the 20 final statements (20%).18 These included
both determinations that a company did not observe the Guidelines as well as
determinations that the Guidelines had been observed.
Box 4. Follow-up in NCP specific instances

Bolloré and Socfin Groups/Socapalm and Sherpa concerning operations in
Cameroon: In June 2017, the NCP of Belgium closed a specific instance involving
the Belgian Group SOCFIN and Socapalm operations in Cameroon. This specific
instance was submitted by the French non-governmental organisation (NGO),
Sherpa, and other NGOs to the NCPs of France, Belgium and Luxembourg in 2010.
The French NCP first took the lead in handling the specific instance, engaging with
the French Group, Bolloré, and the submitters between 2010-2013. This resulted in
an agreement amongst Sherpa and Bolloré to elaborate a remediation plan to be
implemented over two years by Socapalm in Cameroon. Three follow-up statements
were later released by the French NCP in 2014, 2015 and 2016 providing updates on
the status of the remediation plan and including additional recommendations with
respect to failures to fully implement the plan. In 2016, the French NCP reviewed its
actions and transferred the leadership of the specific instance to the Belgian NCP as
the Socfin Group (Socapalm’s parent company) had accepted its good offices. The
Belgian NCP offered mediation to the parties and hosted three meetings between
them. In its final statement, published in June 2017, the Belgian NCP noted that that
the remediation plan agreed to in 2013 was only partially implemented by the Socfin
Group and provided additional recommendations to the enterprise. It invited the
parties to a follow-up meeting to discuss measures taken by the Socfin Group in
relation to this specific instance within one year. The NCPs of France and Belgium
have coordinated their actions and shared draft statements with respect to this
specific instance since 2010.

1.1.6.

Follow-up

Following up on specific instances can be a valuable exercise in ensuring agreements
reached through specific instance proceedings are implemented and in tracking
whether recommendations are being implemented (See Box 4). In 2017, the NCPs of
Belgium, France, and the Netherlands, issued follow-up statements relating to
specific instances. In addition, follow-up is mentioned in seven of the 20 final
statements (35%) available for concluded specific instances. NCPs are increasingly
engaging in follow-up of specific instances. Follow-up has been identified as a
valuable activity by parties to specific instances and has, in some situations, resulted
in stronger relationships between the parties and additional positive outcomes.
Further analysis on ways to carry out follow-up and its impact could be useful to
promote strengthened outcomes of the NCP system.

1.1.7.

Specific instances not accepted for further examination

As noted above, 35% of specific instances closed in 2017 were not accepted for
further examination (12 specific instances). This rate is within the range of, and close
to, the highest historical rates of non-acceptance which have been between 25% and
40% since 2001.19
The main reason for not accepting specific instances in 2017 was a lack of
materiality and substantiation. This reason was provided in 10 (83%) of the specific
instances not accepted for further examination. The existence of parallel proceedings
was referenced in two specific instances (17%). The Guidelines do not define
“material” or “substantiated”, or provide further guidance on how to evaluate these
criteria with respect to submissions. Some NCPs have created templates for the
submission of specific instances to set clear indications on the nature and level of
information required from submitters. Some NCPs, as general practice, follow up
with submitters to ensure that submissions are complete and adequately
substantiated. Such practices can help ensure that NCPs encourage accessibility to
the greatest extent possible.

1.1.8.

Duration of procedures

Of the 35 specific instances closed in 2017, the initial assessment period exceeded
three months in 17 of them (48%). In two of these, the initial assessment was
completed eleven months after the original submission of the specific instance and,
in another two, completion of the initial assessment took over a year. Information on
the timeframe for the initial assessment is not available for 12 specific instances. The
Commentary on the Implementation Procedures provides an indicative timeframe of
three months for completing the initial assessment.20 NCPs have identified this as a
challenge. On the other hand, stakeholders have identified long initial assessment
periods as a shortcoming of the mechanism and have expressed that completing this
process sooner would make the system more impactful and effective.
The Commentary on the Implementation Procedures provides that “[a]s a general
principle, NCPs should strive to conclude the procedure within 12 months from
receipt of the specific instance. It is recognised that this timeframe may need to be
extended if circumstances warrant it, such as when the issues arise in a non-adhering
country.”21 In 13 (37%) of the 35 specific instances closed in 2017, proceedings
lasted for over two years, in five of the 13 they lasted for over three years, and one of
the 13 proceedings took eight years in total. In some cases delays reflect extended

follow-up activities, challenges in handling complex and transnational issues, or
multiple mediation or dialogue sessions, sometimes requested by parties to specific
instances. A better understanding of the reasons behind delays could be useful to
develop tools and strategies for ensuring that specific instances are handled
efficiently and predictably.

Overview and trends of new specific instances in the reporting period
A total of 28 new specific instances were submitted to NCPs in 2017 compared to 34
submitted in 2016. This is slightly lower than general annual rates of submission
since 2000 (see Figure 3).

Of the 28 new specific instances submitted, the following trends were noted:
Sector: The financial sector and manufacturing sectors were the most frequently
cited sector, accounting for 25% and 18% respectively of all new submissions. This
is in line with recent trends as the financial sector has been the most frequently cited
sector in specific instances filed since 2015.
Chapter: The human rights chapter continues to be the most cited chapter in specific
instances, which is also in line with previous years. In 2017, it was referenced in 54%
of all specific instances submitted. The second most cited chapter was the
Employment and Industrial relations chapter, accounting for 39% of all specific
instances submitted.
In 2017, 18 NCPs received specific instance submissions (representing 38% of all
NCPs). The NCPs of Denmark and the Netherlands received the highest number of
submissions (four submissions each), followed by the NCPs of France, Italy, Spain
and the United States which received two submissions each.

The Commentary on the Implementation Procedures provides that the NCP of the
host country should consult with the NCP of the home country in its efforts to assist
the parties in resolving the issues. 22 It also provides that when issues arise from an
enterprise’s activity that takes place in several adhering countries or from the activity
of a group of enterprises organised as a consortium, joint venture or similar form,
based in different adhering countries, the lead NCP should consult with other
NCPs.23 Five specific instances (18%) of those submitted in 2017 are being handled
with the help of supporting NCPs. This is lower than the last reporting cycle where
26% of specific instances filed were being handled with the help of a supporting
NCP.
Coordination on specific instances has been identified by NCPs as an ongoing
challenge. Specific instances being filed with NCPs are increasing complex and the
nature of global business operations, supply chains, investment chains, and corporate
structures today has meant that identifying the lead NCP can be challenging.
Additionally, diversity across NCPs in terms of their level of functionality as well as
variation in procedural rules for handling specific instances has meant that there has
not been a consistent approach to coordination. In this respect this year the OECD
began development of a paper that seeks to consider current challenges in specific
instance coordination amongst NCPs and identify good practice to help ensure
consistency and encourage resolution of issues.

1.2.1.

Specific instances by industry sectors

As noted above, specific instances related to the financial sector were the most
prevalent of new specific instances in 2017 accounting for 25% (seven specific
instances) of all specific instances submitted (see Box 5). The second most prevalent

sector is the manufacturing sector (five specific instances), followed by the electricity
and gas sector (four specific instances) (See Figure 5).
Specific instances involving the financial sector have significant increases in terms of
submissions of complaints, from about 8% of specific instances from 2000-2010 to
around 20% of specific instances from since 2015. Increased attention is being paid
to the role of investors to seek to mitigate environmental, labour, and human rights
risks in their underlying companies as well as recognition of the financial materiality
that such risks may bring. Investors and other financial service providers are
involved in a diverse range of sectors and are uniquely position to exert leverage on
their clients or investee companies.

Chapters of the Guidelines cited in specific instances

The chapter on human rights was cited in 15 specific instances, representing 54% of
all specific instances submitted, and was the most frequently cited chapter. This is in
line with previous years since the 2011 revision of the Guidelines when the chapter
on human rights was added. The preponderance of specific instances submitted citing
the human rights chapter may be explained by the fact that increasingly impacts
related to employment and labour issues and the environment are being recognised
and framed as human rights impacts. Additionally the human rights chapter of the
Guidelines aligns with recommendations in the UN Guiding Principles on Business
and Human Rights (UNGPs).
The second most frequently cited chapter was the chapter on general policies, mainly
with respect to provisions on due diligence, followed by the chapter on employment
and industrial relations which is similarly in line with 2016. Three chapters of the

Guidelines were not cited in any specific instance during this reporting period:
Science and Technology, Taxation and Competition24 (see Figure 6).
Box 5. Specific instances involving the financial sector in 2017

ING and Oxfam Novib: In May 2017, the NGOs Oxfam Novib, Greenpeace,
BankTrack and Friends of the Earth Netherlands submitted a specific instance to the
Dutch NCP concerning ING, a Dutch bank. Specifically, the submitters argued that
the bank does not report the levels of greenhouse gas emissions caused by its lending
activities and has not yet announced whether it intends to do so in the near future. In
addition, they argued that the bank has not set a target to reduce greenhouse gas
emissions in its lending. In their submission they ask the NCP to examine ING’s
climate policy and to urge ING to align its climate and other policies with the
Guidelines. The Dutch NCP accepted the specific instance in November 2017 and
offered its good offices to the parties, which are currently ongoing.
Crédit Suisse and Society for Threatened Peoples Switzerland (North Dakota
Access Pipeline): In April 2017, the Swiss NCP received a submission from the
Society for Threatened Peoples (STP) concerning the business relationship of Credit
Suisse with companies involved in the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline
(“DAPL”) in the United States. The submitter notes that despite international
criticism about the project, Credit Suisse has increased its business relations with
enterprises involved in the construction of the DAPL. The Swiss NCP accepted the
specific instance in October 2017 and offered its good offices to the parties, which
are currently ongoing.

Host countries

12 of the specific instances submitted in 2017 address issues arising in one of the 48
Adherent countries and 11 address issues arising in non-Adherent countries.
Information on the remaining five specific instances is not available at this time as
they are still in progress. This data also illustrates the global reach of the Guidelines
and the NCP mechanism. Since the year 2000 NCPs have handled specific instances
involving issues arising in over 100 countries and territories.

Submitters of specific instances

As in previous years, NGOs have continued to be the primary users of the NCP
system. In 2017, their share of submissions was 39% (11 specific instances), this is
lower than in previous years where they have accounted for approximately 50% of
all submissions. Trade unions made 32% of submissions (nine specific instances) and
individuals made 21% of submissions (six specific instances). In 2017, one specific
instance was submitted by a local community (See Figure 7).

Locations

As set out in the Decision on the Guidelines, NCPs are required to meet the core
criteria for functional equivalence of: visibility, accessibility, transparency and
accountability25, in addition specific instances should be handled in a way that is
impartial, predictable, equitable and compatible with the Guidelines.26 Governments
have flexibility on how they structure their NCPs provided the core criteria are met.
As at January 2018, 31 NCPs are based in Ministries of Economy (including
ministries of trade, investment, business, etc.), five NCPs are based in Investment
Promotion Agencies and seven NCPs are based in Ministries of Foreign Affairs.

Four NCPs are structured as independent agencies (Denmark, Lithuania, Netherlands
and Norway). An independent NCP is one whose members do not belong to a
government administration, although it will generally be supported by a Secretariat
based in a government administration. Three NCPs are structured as tripartite
agencies involving government, trade unions and business in their decision-making
(France, Belgium and Sweden) and an additional two NCPs are structured as
quadripartite (Czech Republic and Finland) adding NGOs to the decision-making
process. Five NCPs (Jordan, Morocco, Peru, Portugal and Romania) are located in
investment promotion agencies.

As part of the core criteria for functional equivalence, NCPs are required to be
accountable. One way to meet this requirement is through regular reporting to the
government or parliament. In 2017, 29 NCPs reported to their respective
governments, of those, 10 also reported to their parliament.

1.3.3.

Meeting attendance and reporting to the OECD

In total, 45 NCPs attended the meetings of the Network of NCPs in both June and
December 2017. Two NCPs did not attend the meetings either in June or December
2017, compared to five in 2016. In 2016, two NCPs did not report to the OECD and
in 2017, two NCPs did not report (Jordan and Tunisia).27

1.3.4.

Stakeholders as part of the institutional arrangements

Stakeholders may be formally integrated into the institutional arrangements of the
NCP, for example as members of the NCP or present on advisory or oversight
bodies. In 2017, 27 NCPs reported having trade union representation, 28 NCPs
reported having business representation, while 19 NCPs reported NGO
representation across the various bodies relating to NCPs (decision-making and
advisory). Regular meetings with external stakeholders may also be organised by
NCPs to formalise their relations and communication with external stakeholders.

1.3.5.

Oversight and advisory bodies

The involvement of different ministries and of stakeholders in NCPs' activities is in
some cases formalised through the establishment of advisory or oversight bodies.
Advisory bodies can be consulted by the NCP on a range of activities and issues on
which it provides advice, while oversight bodies have a monitoring role, for example
on whether the NCP has followed its own rules of procedure. Both advisory and
oversight bodies can include representatives from trade unions, NGOs, business
and/or academia, along with representatives of other government ministries or
agencies. They do not normally form part of the NCP and do not have decisionmaking power on accepting or concluding specific instances. In 2017, 19 NCPs
reported having an advisory body and four NCPs reported having a combined
oversight and advisory body. Additional NCPs are in the process of considering
development of advisory bodies.
In this respect a session was organised during a meeting of the NCP Network to
identify good practice in structuring advisory or oversight bodies for NCPs including
thinking through: nomination or appointment or representatives; representation; size;
ensuring that advisory bodies are constructive and critical; designating a chair;

agenda setting; decision- making processes; defining the functions and mandate of
advisory and oversight bodies; and reporting functions of advisory bodies and
oversight.

1.3.6.

NCP resources

Adherents are required to provide human and financial resources to their NCP to
ensure it can meet its mandate of promoting the Guidelines and handling specific
instances. Nonetheless, lack of resources is often cited as a barrier by both NCPs and
stakeholders.
In 2017, 17 NCPs reported having both dedicated full-time and part-time staff
working on NCP matters. A further 9 NCPs reported having full-time staff and a
further 19 NCPs reported having part-time staff.
With regards financial resources, a total of 19 NCPs reported having access to a
dedicated budget for their activities, while all reporting NCPs noted that funds would
be available for attending NCP meetings, for promotional events and for activities
linked to specific instances should they be requested. In 2017 seven NCPs hired
professional mediators to assist in handling specific instances (Colombia, Italy,
Korea, the Netherlands, Norway, Switzerland and the United States). Seven NCPs
conducted mediation using NCP staff (Austria, Belgium, Canada, France, Germany,
Norway and Sweden.)
In order to build capacity on mediation amongst NCPs a session was organised
during a biannual meeting of the NCP Network. Activities on key moments in
mediation were organised building upon activities of the Mediation Academy
workshop organised by the US NCP (see section on NCP hosted peer learning events
below for more information).
1.4.

Promotion of the Guidelines
Part of the NCP mandate is to promote the Guidelines and to handle enquiries. In
2017, a total of 169 promotional events were organised or co-organised by 35 NCPs.
Of this group, there were 5 NCPs28 which organised or co-organised 75 events. A
total of 13 NCPs29 did not organise or co-organise any promotional events.
The types of events organised by NCPs ranged from training, official meetings with
stakeholders, annual meetings with stakeholders to report on NCP activities, to larger
conferences on topics such as due diligence and responsible supply chains and those
specific to different industries such as the garment sector or mining.
In addition to organising events, 33 NCPs reported taking part in a total of 405 events
organised by others, during which they participated in presentations, panels and
discussions, contributing to promoting the Guidelines and the NCP. Half of these
events were carried out by five NCPs.30 In total, 41 NCPs either held or attended
promotional events during 2017, compared to 35 in 2016. A total of 7 NCPs31 did not
organise, co-organise nor participate in any promotional events in 2017 compared to
11 NCPs in the last reporting period.
In addition to holding and contributing to promotional events, NCPs use a variety of
tools to promote the Guidelines and the specific instance mechanism. For instance,
the French NCP signed a partnership with the Human Rights Club of the French
network of the UN Global Compact to collaborate on human rights related activities.

-----------------------Page 31 End-----------------------

30 │ 1. NATIONAL CONTACT POINTS FOR RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS CONDUCT
The Austrian NCP conducted its annual survey among the business community to
measure awareness of the Guidelines and the NCP. Similar awareness-raising
surveys have been undertaken by the NCPs of Costa Rica, Denmark, Italy, the
Netherlands, Switzerland and Ukraine.
A total of 33 NCPs reported having a promotional plan for 2018 setting out target
audiences for promotional activities over the coming year, compared to 25 in 2016.
NCPs also spoke at the GFRBC in June 2017 where a dedicated session addressed
interesting developments in NCP cases including cases involving non-profit
organisations, public agencies and sports organisations. This session brought together
representatives of the NCPs of the Netherlands and Switzerland, along with
representatives of BIAC, OECD Watch and TUAC. In February 2017, the NCPs of
France, Denmark and Germany spoke at the OECD Roundtable on due diligence in
the garment and footwear sector. The NCP of France spoke on a panel addressing
responsible employment of migrant workers; the NCPs of Denmark and Germany
presented specific instances related to the sector at a dedicated lunchtime session.
Many NCPs have begun to adopt an analytical approach to promotional activities for
example through developing detailed promotional plans with key targets and
objectives. For example the US NCP strategy for outreach includes measurement
criteria to assess the impact of outreach activities which includes: the number of
participants and opportunities for follow-up engagement; peer learning and capacity
building opportunities; and, the multiplier effect: publicity generated surrounding the
NCP’s engagement.
Additionally NCPs are seeking to measure the impact of their promotional activities
and to help shape their promotional activities through conducting awareness
measuring surveys on the Guidelines and NCP mechanism. The NCPs of Austria,
Denmark, the Netherlands and Switzerland have all carried out such surveys. To
support these activities during a meeting of the NCP Network the OECD Secretariat
presented on methodological approaches for designing surveys or research to
measure awareness. Recent studies measuring awareness and implementation of
RBC by NCPs and other entities were also discussed.

1.4.1.

Accessibility of information – NCP websites

Although there is no specific requirement on NCPs to create a website, it can help
NCPs meet the core criteria of visibility and accessibility as websites generally serve
as a main source of information about the NCP and its activities. NCP websites also
serve as platforms for conveying information on the Guidelines, and explain the
NCP’s role and procedures. They can also be the main point of contact for raising
enquiries and submitting specific instances.
A total of 44 NCPs have websites in place which provides information regarding the
Guidelines and the NCP, as well as contact information for reaching the NCP
directly. Of these, 35 NCP websites include the NCP’s rules of procedures.
In addition, four NCPs created a new website in 2017 (Iceland, Kazakhstan, Poland
and Turkey). Seven NCPs also improved their websites (Argentina, Austria, Canada,
France, the Slovak Republic, Slovenia and the United States). The NCPs in Argentina,
Austria and France added to their website a template form for submitting specific
instances. The NCP in Austria also placed a direct link to the NCP on the home page of
the ministry and the NCP in Canada created a new infographic explaining the specific
ANNUAL REPORT ON THE OECD GUIDELINES FOR MULTINATIONAL ENTERPRISES 2017 © OECD 2018

1. NATIONAL CONTACT POINTS FOR RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS CONDUCT

instance process and added short summaries of ongoing NCP cases to the website. Two
NCPs created new brochures available online to explain the NCP (Austria and Finland)
and two NCPs created new promotional materials to visually explain the different
stages of the specific instance process (Canada and France).

1.4.2.

NCP hosted peer learning events

On 18-19 May 2017, the Polish NCP hosted a workshop convened by OECD Watch
to address co-operation and trust building amongst NCPs in Central and Eastern
European countries. NCPs from Estonia and Lithuania joined the meeting which
focused on civil society activities in the region.
On 25-26 September 2017, the NCP in the United States hosted a peer-learning event
focused on building key skills for mediation. Sessions were led by the Consensus
Building Institute and a total of eleven NCPs participated in this mediation academy.
The training included several role play sessions to highlight the different steps
involved in a mediation process.
On 24-25 October 2017, the NCP in the Slovak Republic held their first promotional
event on the Guidelines and combined this meeting with a peer learning session
involving NCPs from Germany, Hungary and the Netherlands. Topics covered
included promotional strategies and building capacity.

1.4.3.

UN Annual Forum on Business and Human Rights

From 27-29 November 2017, the UN Annual Forum on Business and Human Rights
took place in Geneva, Switzerland. The Forum focused for the first time on access to
remedy. This was a welcome focus for NCPs and the event brought together NCPs
from 15 counties, many of which participated in panels to raise awareness of
developments across NCPs.
Two OECD-led sessions took place at the forum, the first focused on lessons learned
from the NCP peer review process which brought together representatives from the
NCPs of Austria, Belgium, the Netherlands, and the United States along with
representatives of OECD Watch and TUAC.
The second session focused on a deep dive into a recent case completed by the NCP
in the Netherlands which brought together the submitter (a former employee of
Bralima, a subsidiary of Heineken), the Dutch NCP mediator, a representative of
Heineken and a representative of OECD Watch.
Several NCP representatives spoke in sessions during the UN Forum. For instance,
the French NCP spoke in a session to discuss the preliminary findings of the OHCHR
Accountability and Remedy Project on state-based non-judicial grievance
mechanisms and in a separate session to present the newly adopted law on the duty
of vigilance.
The annual forum also provided an opportunity for the first joint meeting between
NCPs and representatives of National Human Rights Institutions to discuss
complementarities in receiving complaints regarding human rights and business.
The OECD participated in the closing session of the forum where it highlighted
recent successes with respect to specific instances handled by NCPs and ongoing
activities being undertaken to strengthen the functioning of the NCP network as a
whole.

Action plan to strengthen NCPs

The Action Plan to strengthen NCPs, continued to be implemented over the course of
2017 under the three strands of peer reviews and capacity building; peer learning and
the development of tools to support NCPs in delivering their mandate.
An important tool to assess the functioning of NCPs, share experiences and provide
recommendations for further improvement are peer reviews. All NCP peer reviews
include on-site visits with extensive consultations with the members of the NCP and
other relevant members of government and stakeholders. In May 2017, Ministers at
the Ministerial Council Meeting specifically made a time-bound commitment that all
of their NCPs would be fully functioning and adequately resourced. In addition, they
agreed that they would all undertake "a peer learning, capacity building exercise or a
peer review by 2021, with the aim of having all countries peer reviewed by 2023."
The Ministers also called for a report on progress to be made to the MCM in 2019.
In 2017, the peer reviews of the NCPs of Italy, Switzerland and France were
completed and on-site visits for the peer reviews of Germany, Chile, the United
States and Austria took place. Recommendations from the completed peer reviews
are included in Annex 3.
An additional three Adherents have committed to a peer review of their NCP in 2018
(Canada, Argentina and the United Kingdom), and four in 2019 (Korea, Sweden,
Brazil and Australia). By 2019, NCPs in all G7 countries, which had committed in
2015 to lead by example and make sure the NCPs in G7 countries are effective, will
have completed a peer review.
In addition, two capacity building exercises took place in Astana, Kazakhstan and in
Kiev, Ukraine. When Kazakhstan and Ukraine were invited to adhere to the
Investment Declaration, it was on the understanding that they would each report on
action to implement the recommendations made in a capacity building exercise.
The capacity building exercise in Astana, Kazakhstan took place on 9-10 October
2017. As agreed by the OECD Council, the capacity building exercise would take "a
particular focus on whether the NCP operates in an impartial manner while
maintaining an adequate level of accountability to the Adherent government and in
accordance with core criteria of visibility, accessibility, transparency and
accountability".
The capacity building exercise in Kiev, Ukraine took place on 12-13 October 2017.
On 13 October 2017, linked to the capacity building exercise, the NCP held a
Responsible Business Forum aimed at representatives from business, business
associations, embassies, trade unions, academia and non-governmental organisations.
The meeting was opened by the Deputy Minister, Ministry of Economic
Development and Trade.
On 6-7 November 2017, a regional workshop on Sustainable investment and
responsible business conduct in the Mediterranean took place in Cairo, Egypt under
the framework of the EU-OECD Programme on Promoting Investment in the
Mediterranean. The NCPs of France and Morocco participated in this event which
was followed by a half-day capacity building exercise with the Egyptian authorities
to support the development of the Egyptian NCP. During the capacity building
session, the NCPs of France and Morocco shared experiences on the mandate of
NCPs, NCP structures and promotional and case-handling activities.

1. NATIONAL CONTACT POINTS FOR RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS CONDUCT

In December 2017, a set of 16 letters were sent by the Secretary-General to Ministers
where National Contact Points are based. The 16 NCPs were identified following the
Council discussion on the Annual Report in May 2017 which highlighted the
following criteria: whether there is an NCP in place; whether the NCP reported to the
OECD Investment Committee in 2016, whether the NCP has a website, whether the
NCP conducted or participated in promotional activities in 2016 and whether the
NCP had rules of procedure for handling specific instances. The letters invited
Ministers to report back on progress and encouraged a continuous dialogue on these
matters. Council members also requested an annual discussion on the implementation
of the Guidelines and to take stock of developments regarding the NCP mechanism.
In November 2017, OECD Watch made the first substantiated submission under the
Procedural Guidance of the Guidelines, part II, section II.2b). This process notes that
the Investment Committee will consider a substantiated submission on whether an
NCP is fulfilling its responsibilities with regard to its handling of specific instances.
The submission was made by OECD Watch in respect of the Australian NCP and
will be considered by the Investment Committee in 2018.

2. DUE DILIGENCE TO IMPLEMENT THE GUIDELINES

Chapter 2
Due diligence to implement the Guidelines

2.1

Policy drivers for due diligence
The Guidelines recommend that enterprises carry out risk-based due diligence to
identify, prevent and mitigate actual and potential adverse impacts, both in their
operations and through their supply chains. Expectations of due diligence for
responsible business conduct are increasingly being reflected in international and
national policy, as well as in some cases regulation. For example the 2017 G20
Leader’s Declaration noted it would work towards establishing adequate policy
frameworks such as national action plans on business and human rights and underline
the responsibility of businesses to exercise due diligence.32 Additionally in 2017 a
revision was issued of the ILO Tripartite Declaration of Principles concerning
Multinational Enterprises and Social Policy Enterprises which added an expectation
that multinational enterprises should carry out due diligence to identify, prevent,
mitigate and account for how they address their actual and potential adverse impacts
that relate to internationally recognized human rights. 33
In March, France adopted legislation imposing a duty of vigilance on large
companies to prepare, implement, and publish details of their due diligence plan to
prevent adverse serious human rights and environmental impacts associated with
their operations and supply chains.34 The law applies to all French joint-stock
companies employing 5 000 employees or more domestically or 10 000 employees or
more internationally, as well as their subsidiaries and certain relevant suppliers and
subcontractors.35 In Switzerland a petition proposing mandatory human rights due
diligence was presented to the Swiss government and is currently under discussion in
the Parliament.36 It will be put up to vote by the public in 2019. Germany’s National
Action Plan commits the government to examine steps to take further action,
including legislative measures if more than 50% of all German-based companies
with over 500 employees have not taken credible action to integrate human rights
due diligence in their operations by 2020.37 In the Netherlands, the government has
been developing so-called International Responsible Business Conduct (IRBC)
Agreements with businesses and NGOs to work together to address human rights
abuse and environmental degradation. IRBC agreements currently exist for the
garment, gold, and banking sectors, with agreements for metallurgy, natural stones,
and the food industry currently under development.38 See Figure 8 below for a
timeline on legislative developments on responsible business conduct.

Statement
(June 2017)

While regulatory directives can represent a strong inducement for companies to carry
out due diligence, a proliferation of expectations at a domestic level can create
challenges for businesses operating globally who may be subject to various
expectations. During the Working Party on Responsible Business Conduct (WPRBC)
meeting of October 2015, several delegations as well as institutional stakeholders
(BIAC, TUAC and OECD Watch) supported the idea of developing a general
guidance on risk-based due diligence for responsible business conduct that can be
applied in any sector of the economy. Such a Guidance could help promote a
common understanding on due diligence for business subject to various domestic
obligations and international instruments and avoid the potential for conflicting
expectations.39
A first draft of this Guidance was submitted to the WPRBC and institutional
stakeholders of the OECD in May 2016. In an effort to seek consensus among all the
stakeholders, key issues were identified through the extensive consultation process
involving a number of public consultations and the establishment of an advisory
group to develop the Guidance.40 In December 2017, a fourth draft of the Guidance

ANNUAL REPORT ON THE OECD GUIDELINES FOR MULTINATIONAL ENTERPRISES 2017 © OECD 2018

-----------------------Page 38 End-----------------------

2. DUE DILIGENCE TO IMPLEMENT THE GUIDELINES

was submitted to the advisory group, with the view to finalising the Guidance for
release in the first half of 2018.
The draft Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Business Conduct was prepared
in order to provide practical support to enterprises by providing a plain language
explanation of the due diligence recommendations in the Guidelines. Enterprises will
be able to use the Guidance, once complete, as a framework for developing and
strengthening their own tailored due diligence systems and processes.
The draft Guidance begins by providing a brief summary of each chapter of the MNE
Guidelines and an overview of due diligence, including some key concepts, so
readers can easily understand the due diligence approach recommended in the MNE
Guidelines. The main body of the Guidance describes the due diligence process and
supporting measures in a step-by-step fashion, with “Practical Actions” included in
each step to further illustrate ways to implement the supporting measures and due
diligence process. Additional explanations, tips, and illustrative examples of due
diligence are referenced and crosslinked throughout the Guidance.
Figure 9. Due diligence process & supporting measures

2.2.

Sectoral work
The OECD has developed sector-specific guidance on due diligence under the
proactive agenda for the OECD Guidelines which aims to help companies carry out
due diligence in their supply chains and respond to risks of adverse impacts
associated with particular products, regions, or industries. These tools, developed in
multi-stakeholder settings, enjoy strong recognition and buy in by stakeholders,
especially the private sector. A number of policy and economic factors continue to
drive uptake of due diligence activities.

2.2.1.

Minerals Sector

Over the course of 2017, new regulatory developments and market dynamics have
helped promote implementation of the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for
Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas
(“OECD Minerals Guidance”) in new geographies, minerals, and industries. These
developments include stronger legislation and government-backed industry

│ 37

-----------------------Page 39 End-----------------------

38 │ 2. DUE DILIGENCE TO IMPLEMENT THE GUIDELINES
standards, particularly in mineral processing and consuming regions like the EU,
China, and India, as well as increased awareness and sensitisation of local
stakeholders on issues relating to artisanal and small scale mining activities in
Colombia and West Africa.

Global regulatory developments leading to uptake in due diligence
In May 2017, the EU adopted a regulation that will require supply chain due
diligence and implementation of the OECD Minerals Guidance for importers of tin,
tantalum, tungsten and gold (3TG).41 The regulation entered into force in June 2017
and its requirements for importers will take full effect in 2021. The regulation is
global in scope and is expected to cover roughly 95% of all imports of 3TG into the
EU. In order to support the EU in the implementation of the new regulation, the
OECD continued efforts to develop and pilot a methodology to assess alignment of
industry-led responsible sourcing initiatives, which will be important input for a
forthcoming EU delegated act on the recognition of industry programmes under the
EU regulation. This has been a powerful accelerator of uptake and awareness of the
expectations of OECD Minerals Guidance, even beyond Europe, as it puts significant
leverage on those industry initiatives (and in turn with their hundreds of member
companies) to fully align to OECD standards and avoids duplication of checks for
those companies that are members of multiple initiatives and fall under several
regulatory regimes, such as the US Dodd Frank Act Section 1502. As part of the
Alignment Assessment, five industry initiatives piloted the methodology by
undergoing shadow audits led by the OECD.42 The industry initiatives are now being
given an opportunity to comment on their assessments and make adjustments before
the final pilot assessment results are released early 2018. The draft Alignment
Assessment Tool and Alignment Assessment Methodology are available online for
individual companies and other industry initiatives to use for self-assessments. These
will be updated when the results of the pilot program are complete.
China is a key market in mineral supply chains, importing and consuming
approximately half of all mineral resources globally. China's commitment and
participation could therefore be a critical element of success for due diligence
implementation programmes globally. In particular, the increasing global need for
energy storage, considered crucial for successfully tackling global climate
challenges, has put pressures on metal markets, in particular for cobalt, which is a
critical resource for lithium-ion batteries (see figure 10). It is widely reported that
over half of the world’s cobalt is sourced from the Democratic Republic of Congo
and then sent to be refined in China, and that large electronic and automobile
manufacturers are facing significant pressures as a result of alleged links with the
cobalt supply chain and human rights impacts, specifically child labour.43 As a result,
China is increasing its drive to align domestic responsible mineral sourcing standards
with international expectations on Chinese industry.
In October 2014 the OECD and the China Chamber of Commerce for Metals,
Minerals and Chemicals Importers and Exporters (CCCMC) signed a Memorandum
of Understanding to develop guidelines on responsible minerals sourcing practices by
Chinese companies. Activities carried out to implement and operationalise this MoU
continued in 2017 and include OECD technical support for the CCCMC.
Concurrently, the OECD is working with commercial regulatory authorities, the
General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine (AQSIQ),
to support their development of national standards and requirements for Chinese

importers, smelters, and refiners of tin, tantalum and tungsten, in line with the OECD
Guidance for minerals. Additionally, the OECD currently sits as an observer for the
Chinese-led Responsible Cobalt Initiative.

India is the second largest importer of gold in the world. In order to meet growing
market demands for responsibly-sourced gold, several industry associations in India
are supporting the development of a due diligence audit programme on responsible
gold. These include the Indian Bullion & Jewellery Association, the Bullion
Federation of India, the Gem & Jewellery Export Promotion Council of India, and
the Indian Bullion Bankers Association. In 2017 the OECD Secretariat helped secure
the interest of major industry players and the Central Government to support the
drafting of responsible gold sourcing guidelines and accompanying audit protocols,
based on the OECD Guidance and tailored to the needs of local Indian gold markets.
Following the recommendation of the Indian Minister of State for Finance, a working
group was formed to draft Indian Responsible Gold Guidelines, in line with the
OECD Guidance for minerals. This is intended to feed into India’s comprehensive
gold policy, to be developed in 2018, and the requirements for delivery into the new
gold exchange to be set up in 2018 in India.

Supporting artisanal and small scale mining
Artisanal and Small Scale Mining (ASM) is a major source of mineral resource
production in the world. It is largely informal, and is associated with low levels of
safety measures, health care or environmental protection. Gradual formalisation of
the ASM sector will reinforce inclusive growth and sustainable development in
resource-rich countries. An estimated 100 million people (workers and families)

depend on ASM in approximately 80 developing countries in Africa, Latin America,
and the Asia-Pacific Region.44 The activity offers opportunities for economic
diversification and shared and inclusive growth, but it has many technical, economic,
social, environmental, and security challenges.

The OECD-led multi-stakeholder group set up to implement the OECD Minerals
Guidance gives special attention to this issue, as artisanal and small-scale miners
operating in conflict-affected and high-risk areas are particularly vulnerable to
adverse impacts and serious abuses associated with the extraction, transport, trade,
handling and export of minerals. In addition, ASM has a very important development
dimension. It is widely agreed that a necessary step to addressing these challenges
and developing the potential of ASM is to support the legalisation and formalisation
of artisanal mining communities. The objective is to build secure, transparent and
verifiable supply chains and to ensure that legitimate artisanal mining communities
can benefit from ongoing trade in conflict-affected and high-risk areas and to support
their development.
In order to contribute to global discussions and current policy developments supporting
ASM formalisation efforts, the OECD works closely with several international
institutions such as the World Bank or the United Nations (in particular in the frame of
the Minamata Convention on Mercury) to support the development of a global
responsible and formalised artisanal mining sector. The OECD, jointly with the World
Bank, has begun development of a global ASM Centre of Excellence to improve future

identification and present coordination of all relevant ASM formalisation projects and
programs being undertaken at a bilateral or multilateral level.46
Additionally, the OECD is assisting the Colombian authorities in imbedding
recommendations from the OECD Minerals Guidance into domestic policy, as well
as technical advice and training for the private sector sourcing from Colombian
artisanal miners. This reform effort comes at a vital time as the government is
moving forward with the peace process, but illegal and criminal gold is reported to
have surpassed cocaine in terms of revenue generation of non-state armed groups and
criminal organisations. The Colombian authorities are rolling out multiple initiatives
that aim to promote the formalisation and regulation of what is still a highly informal
gold sector. These legislative and policy developments are outlined in a series of
assessments conducted by the OECD on Colombian gold supply chains.47 They
include a number of new mechanisms designed to facilitate the legalisation of miners
that have been working without a title. The Colombian government expressed
interest in further cooperation with and development of these initiatives during the
May 2017 OECD-World Bank event on Artisanal and Small Scale Mining.
ASM in the gold sector in Mali, Niger, Burkina Faso, and Cote d’Ivoire could employ
as much as two million individuals and thus has substantial economic implications for
the region. Following calls from stakeholders to expand the implementation
programme into new geographies and working with local partners, the OECD
conducted two on-the-ground workshops for stakeholders in West Africa to promote
the dissemination of the OECD Guidance, in Cote d’Ivoire in February 2017 and
Burkina Faso in October 2017. The workshops were well attended by government
officials from Mali, Niger, Cote d’Ivoire, and Burkina Faso, local NGOs, and private
sector participants. Discussion topics ranged from ASM formalisation efforts, gold
smuggling, and specific training on implementation of the OECD Minerals Guidance.
Discussions also continued at the annual Forum on Responsible Mineral Supply
Chains, organised at the OECD in May 2017.48 The Forum provided the opportunity
to review and discuss implementation of the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for
Minerals, the ICGLR Regional Certification Mechanism and other initiatives to
enable responsible mineral supply chains. More than 900 stakeholders came together
to focus on regulatory, compliance and alignment efforts, regional implementation of
due diligence in Latin America, Central and West Africa, India, and China, and
responsible sourcing initiatives in a variety of mineral supply chains, including gold,
precious stones, cobalt, coal, and mica.

2.2.2.

Garment Sector

Launch of a government-backed Due Diligence Guidance
The first supplier code of conduct was a product of the garment and footwear
industry in the 1990s and represents the relatively long history of engaging on labour
and environmental risks in the sector. Although the sector was amongst the first to
respond to risks in its supply chain, the tragic collapse of the Rana Plaza factory in
2013, which claimed over 1 100 lives, was a jarring reminder of the persistent labour,
human rights, corruption and environmental risks in the sector and the need for a
comprehensive approach to identifying and preventing adverse impacts. The OECD
Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains in the Garment and
Footwear Sector (“OECD Garment Guidance”) was approved by the Investment

42 │ 2. DUE DILIGENCE TO IMPLEMENT THE GUIDELINES
Committee on 14 January 2017. The Recommendation of the Council on the OECD
Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains in the Garment and
Footwear Sector was adopted in June 2017. The Guidance and Recommendation
were launched in a special event on 8 February 2017 held at the OECD.49
The OECD Garment Guidance builds on the in-depth reports of the NCPs of France
and Italy on the implementation of the OECD Guidelines in the textile and garment
sector and the initiatives of Belgium, Canada, Denmark, the European Union,
Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the United States in the
sector. It seeks to respond to statements made in June 2013 and 2014 by NCPs
following the collapse of Rana Plaza.50 The OECD Garment Guidance was also
developed in response to the Ministerial Communiqué on Responsible Business
Conduct adopted on 26 June 2014, and the G7 Leaders’ Declaration adopted on 7-8
June 2015, which welcomed international efforts to promulgate industry-wide due
diligence standards in the textile and ready-made garment sector.

Capacity and awareness building of government, industry and trade unions
Due diligence under the OECD Garment Guidance diverges from traditional auditdriven compliance models carried out in the sector since the 1990s in that it
recognises the importance of supplier assessments, but moves the primary focus from
auditing to monitoring and prevention. Furthermore, it requires companies to look
beyond suppliers with whom they have direct contractual relationships to seek to
address risks that may be linked to subcontracting or found deeper in their supply
chains. Finally, a due diligence approach under the OECD Garment Guidance
requires companies to assess their own purchasing practices which may be
contributing to labour, human rights and environmental risks in their supply chains.
Recognising this shift in how the sector identifies and addresses risks in its supply
chain, a key component of the OECD’s work to support implementation of the
OECD Garment Guidance in 2017 was building the awareness and capacity of
industry on due diligence. This work also seeks to build the awareness of
governments– both of importing and producing economies – and trade unions on
how they can enable due diligence. Key activities to support the awareness raising
and capacity building of industry and stakeholders include the OECD Roundtable on
Due Diligence in the Garment and Footwear Sector, practical scenario-workshops,
webinars and speaking engagements at key industry events.51

Towards harmonisation and alignment with the OECD Garment Guidance
Thanks to its early response to stakeholder pressures to address known labour and
environmental risks in the sector, the garment and footwear sector is uniquely
characterised by numerous industry, civil society and multi-stakeholder initiatives
that hold labour and environmental codes of conduct, auditing protocols, and provide
capacity building to enterprises and their suppliers. While the above initiatives have
been instrumental in propelling the sector forward in responding to known sector
labour and environmental risks, they have also been criticised for contributing to the
outsourcing of enterprise responsibility to assess, monitor and prevent adverse
impacts in the supply chain. Furthermore, in many cases, industry, civil society and
multi-stakeholder initiatives have been criticised for multiplying standards and an
over-emphasis on auditing, thus leading to duplicative auditing and auditing fatigue
amongst suppliers.52 While industry and civil society-led initiatives have been
commonplace in the sector for years, a more recent development has been the
ANNUAL REPORT ON THE OECD GUIDELINES FOR MULTINATIONAL ENTERPRISES 2017 © OECD 2018

2. DUE DILIGENCE TO IMPLEMENT THE GUIDELINES

establishment of government-backed multi-stakeholder initiatives, including the
German Partnership for Sustainable Textiles, the Dutch Covenant Agreement on
Sustainable Garments, and industry-trade union agreements, as well as the French
Working Group for sustainable garment supply chains.
The above context led to strong calls from industry and government towards
harmonisation and recognition across initiatives and from all stakeholders for
alignment with the OECD Garment Guidance to encourage high-standards of due
diligence, and to enhance the coherence, effectiveness and credibility of initiatives
that seek to operationalise the Guidance. In response, one of the key pillars to the
OECD’s work in the garment and footwear sector in 2017 was the development of an
Alignment Assessment Tool, which builds on the learnings of a similar tool
developed under the OECD minerals sector work.53 The OECD will pilot the
Alignment Assessment Tool in 2018 to carry out comprehensive reviews of key
industry and multi-stakeholder initiatives on their alignment with the OECD Garment
Guidance. The Alignment Assessment Tool is also designed for individual company
use so that enterprises can assess the alignment of their due diligence with OECD
Garment Guidance, thus further supporting capacity building of industry. The OECD
further supported the convergence of standards in the sector through its contribution
on the Steering Committee of the Social and Labour Convergence Project (SLCP).
Launched in 2015, the SLCP seeks to develop a simple, converged industry-wide
labour and human rights assessment framework that reduces the number of social and
labour assessments in the industry. The OECD contributes to this project by
providing input on the strategic direction of the project, and to support its alignment
with the OECD Guidance.

Engaging key markets
Accounting for 39 percent of global clothing exports and 37.4 percent of global
textile exports, China is an important actor in the garment and footwear sector.54 In
2017 the OECD laid the groundwork for an MOU with the China National Apparel
and Textile Council (CNTAC) to develop a Chinese Guidance aligned with the
OECD Garment Guidance. The Guidance is expected to be relevant to Chinese
companies operating within and from China. This work will build on experience
collaborating with the CCCMC in the development of the Chinese Due Diligence
Guidelines for Responsible Mineral Supply Chains.55 The implementation
programme of the Chinese Guidance, which will commence in 2018, will fall under
the OECD’s broader partnership with the EU and ILO to support responsible
business conduct in China.
As the second largest textile fibre producer in the world, India also remains an
important global actor in the garment and textile sectors. In recent years key end
markets for the textile industry in India have seen an increase in legislation and other
policy developments that hold companies accountable to addressing labour and
environmental impacts not only in their own operations but also in their supply
chains. This is particularly true of the EU, which represents the largest end market
for India in the textile and garment sector. Furthermore, since 2012, a number of civil
society reports have highlighted alleged labour and human rights risks in the textile
sector in India. The findings of these reports have been discussed in the Dutch
Parliament and are identified as priorities under both the National Textile Compact
and the German Partnership for Sustainable Textiles. Within the above context, and
building on the demand from global industry and OECD Member governments, the

OECD laid the groundwork in 2017 for a partnership with the Indian textile industry
and global brands to develop an Indian-driven response to support responsible
sourcing based on the recommendations in the OECD Garment Guidance in the
textile sector in India. This potential partnership grew out of OECD engagement in
India with Indian industry during the OECD-DIPP Roundtable on Investment hosted
in Delhi in April 2017 and follow-up discussions with the Confederation of Indian
Industry in December 2017.

2.2.3.

Financial Sector

Responding to a growing understanding of investor responsibility
Spurred by the global financial crisis and ongoing global challenges such as climate
change, increasingly, a broader understanding of fiduciary duty is being recognised
in the context of institutional investors. A study by the UNEP Finance Initiative, UN
Global Compact and the PRI concluded that “failing to consider long-term
investment value drivers, which include environmental, social and governance issues,
in investment practice is a failure of fiduciary duty.”56 Likewise a core
recommendation of the EU High-Level Expert Group on sustainable finance
recognises that incorporating information related to ESG factors into investment
decisions is part of an investor's fiduciary duty.57
The OECD work on RBC for institutional investors recognises that developing
processes to manage RBC risks supports an investor’s ability to represent the
interests and expectations of its beneficiaries, and provides a clear due diligence
approach for how asset owners and investment managers can achieve this. In
February 2017 the OECD paper on Responsible Business Conduct for Institutional
Investors was adopted by the Investment Committee, launched and broadly
disseminated. Awareness raising events and workshops with practitioners in the UK,
Norway, Denmark, Belgium, Canada and France helped to inform practitioners about
how to implement the recommendations of the paper. In addition, trainings have been
organised with OECD National Contact Points to help them build a stronger
technical understanding of the sector, which in turn could support them in handling
specific instances implicating institutional investors. Ongoing challenges with
respect to recognising a broader understanding of fiduciary duty were discussed
during a session on the OECD paper on Responsible Business Conduct for
Institutional Investors and Investment governance and the integration of
environmental, social and governance factors, organised during the 2017 OECD
Global Forum on Responsible Business Conduct.

Understanding accountability in the context of financial activities
Increasing scrutiny is being paid to the responsibility of banks with respect to
adverse impacts that their clients cause or contribute to. Over the past several years
the financial sector has been the sector with the highest number of new specific
instance submissions to OECD National Contact Points.58 In 2017 two submissions
were filed with the NCP mechanism addressing the responsibility of banks in the
context of reporting on climate risks and financing of the Dakota Access Pipeline
(See Box 5, Chapter 2). Additionally various initiatives are seeking to define the
responsibility of banks with respect to their financing activities. In December 2017
the Thun group of banks released a paper on the implications of UN Guiding
Principles 13b and 17 in a Corporate and Investment Banking Context.59 In June of
2017 the OHCHR published a paper on the application of the UN Guiding Principles
on Business and Human Rights in the context of the banking sector.60 The Dutch
Banking Sector Agreement on International Responsible Business Conduct
Regarding Human Rights, a group of Dutch practitioners and experts has been
seeking to develop guidance outlining responsible practices in the context of banking
transactions.

46 │ 2. DUE DILIGENCE TO IMPLEMENT THE GUIDELINES
With the objective of developing a widely-support and recognised approach, the
OECD has launched the second phase of its work on RBC in the financial sector
focused on corporate lending activities and under
nts are put towards projects and companies that behave responsibly and thereby help
achieve the objectives writing. This project will seek to identify due diligence
approaches for banks to ensure they adequately avoid and address to risks related to
responsible business conduct associated with their clients. Currently no broadly
recognised standard on environmental and social due diligence exists for general
corporate lending and underwriting, although these transactions represent the
majority of financing activity by banks.
An advisory group to support the project was reconstituted with experts from the
banking sector and a scoping paper providing analysis of key considerations for due
diligence under the principal products and services provided by finance institutions
has been developed. A comparative analysis was conducted to understand the
relationship of due diligence approaches under the OECD Guidelines for
Multinational Enterprises to other leading environmental and social standards in the
context of corporate finance (i.e. the Equator Principles, the IFC performance
standards, the Recommendation of the Council on Common Approaches for
Officially Supported Export Credits and Environmental and Social Due Diligence.)
The advisory group has met on several occasions and the first expert meeting for this
work will take place in March 2018. In preparation for the expert meeting case
studies are being developed on the application of due diligence frameworks in the
context of corporate lending.

Recognising the role of the financial sector in driving sustainable
development
Since the introduction of the Paris Climate Agreement in 2015, investors have been
facing increasing expectations to manage climate risks in their portfolios. In 2017 the
Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), an industry-led
initiative developed a set of recommendations for voluntary climate-related financial
disclosures.
International financial institutions have also signalled plans to mobilise USD
400 billion towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Strong
due diligence processes can help ensure that investment of the SDGs. A session on
innovative tools for responsible finance was organised at the 2017 Global Forum on
Responsible Business Conduct to discuss innovative approaches finance institutions
are working on to promote sustainability. Thinking through the positive contribution
the financial sector can make to sustainable development will be a key component of
the ongoing work on RBC in the context of corporate lending.

2.2.4.

Agriculture Sector

Answering the call for greater supply chain due diligence in agriculture
Agricultural production is expected to increase by almost 60% by 2050 to feed 9.1
billion people.61 As such, agricultural production in developing countries may double
during that time period.62 While agriculture jobs accounts for up to a third of global
employment, enterprises operating in the sector face several changes to respect core
labour rights in the sector, particularly the exclusion of many agricultural workers

2. DUE DILIGENCE TO IMPLEMENT THE GUIDELINES

from national labour laws, low wages, dangerous working conditions, the largely
unrecognised role of women in agriculture, and a high incidence of child and forced
labour.
Since the launch of the OECD-FAO Guidance for Responsible Agricultural Supply
Chains63 in March 2016, and following a call by the G7 Agricultural Ministers to
promote implementation of the this Guidance,64 the OECD Secretariat has participated
in a number of conferences and events to raise awareness of the Guidance with policy
makers and promote its uptake by enterprises. A pilot implementation programme with
enterprises will be launched in February 2018. The pilot will aim to support enterprises
in implementing the OECD-FAO Guidance and should serve as a voluntary, collective
learning exercise. It will allow participating enterprises to learn by doing, proactively
develop solutions to manage risks along agricultural supply chains and put appropriate
due diligence processes in place. Over 30 companies and certification initiatives
committed to participate in the pilot programme.

3. GOVERNMENT POLICIES IN SUPPORT OF RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS CONDUCT

Chapter 3
Government policies in support
of Responsible Business Conduct

Background
In the context of global challenges concerning climate, poverty, and sustainable
development, governments are increasingly committed to designing and
implementing a strong policy framework that supports and promotes RBC. This
involves establishing and enforcing a legal framework in the areas covered by the
Guidelines, and providing recognition and incentives to businesses that behave in
line with RBC standards. It also entails that governments observe RBC standards in
their role of economic actor (e.g. through public procurement, export credits, and
development finance), and as owners of enterprises.
Several OECD instruments recognise the importance of governments' role in
promoting and enabling RBC and in designing and implementing a strong RBC
policy framework. The Policy Framework for Investment includes a Chapter on
policies for promoting and enabling RBC (Chapter 7) and RBC is now systematically
integrated into Investment Policy Reviews (IPRs), which take the PFI as a basis.
IPRs have become an important tool for outreach on the Guidelines and dialogue
with non-Adherents on levelling the playing field for responsible investment.
Consequently, the reviews for adherence to the OECD Declaration on Investment
and Multinational Enterprises and for accession to the OECD now also consider RBC
policies. The Roundtable for Policy-Makers, held since 2015 as part of the Global
Forum on Responsible Business Conduct, has provided a space for dialogue among
policy makers responsible for designing and implementing policies to enable and
promote RBC.
Collaboration and coordination outside and inside the OECD to ensure coherence
around RBC policies has strengthened over the years. Both the UN Guiding
Principles for Business and Human Rights and the ILO Tripartite Declaration of
Principles concerning Multinational Enterprises and Social Policy address the role of
Governments to promote corporate responsibility. The OECD cooperates with the
UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (UNOHCHR) and the
International Labour Organisation (ILO) in this area, in the context of the GFRBC's
Roundtable for Policy-makers, as well regional projects in Asia and Latin America
(see Annex 5).
With regard to Government policies in support of RBC, the OECD has an important
value added. Beyond labour and human rights, the OECD Guidelines promote RBC
across the entire spectrum of issues where business operations intersect with society,
including also corruption, environment, consumer protection, taxation, etc.

50 │ 3. GOVERNMENT POLICIES IN SUPPORT OF RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS CONDUCT
Moreover, the OECD covers a wide range of policy areas, in which technical experts
from governments work together to share experiences and set international standards
relating to economic policies which have a bearing on RBC. In practice, the growing
work on RBC policies has therefore led to an increased number of horizontal efforts
through policy analysis and advice, but also legal instruments which recognise
governments' responsibility to create an enabling environment for RBC. In 2017,
several developments within and outside OECD showed the increasing focus on the
government's role in promoting RBC, including through stronger policy coherence.

3.1.

Overarching policies and action plans for RBC
Policy coherence relies on communication, collaboration and coordination across
ministries and government agencies. National Action Plans on Business and Human
Rights or on Responsible Business Conduct have become an important tool through
which Governments have tried to unify national efforts, to provide an overarching
policy framework for RBC, and to ensure coordination and coherence within the
government. As of December 2017, 20 countries, all of which are Adherents to the
OECD Guidelines, have adopted a NAP and 21 countries are in the process of
developing or have committed to developing one.65 In 2017 alone, 8 new NAPs were
launched. The scope of NAPs varies from country to country. Some go beyond the
theme of business and human rights by encompassing the environment (for example
France and Italy) and RBC more generally, such as the United States and Switzerland
(see also table 4).
In some cases, NAPs on Business and Human Rights complement existing laws,
regulations and policy tools. For instance, many EU members have adopted NAPs on
Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) following the 2011 renewal of the EU CSR
strategy.66 It is important that governments ensure that the links between the different
but related action plans are made explicit and that the ministries involved in
developing these plans ensure complementary and alignment. For example, this is
especially relevant as a new set of national plans to implement the Sustainable
Development Goals (SDGs) are in the process of being developed.67 Japan, for
example, has pledged that the progress of the NAP on Business and Human Rights
would function as an indicator for the achievement of the SDGs.68
By exchanging information and sharing experiences on NAPs either completed or
under development, governments can share learnings on good practices for interministerial collaboration and strengthened policy coherence. This was the purpose of
the session National Action Plans on Business and Human Rights to enable policy
coherence for responsible business conduct, at the GFRBC's Roundtable for Policy
Makers 2017, organised jointly with the UNOHCHR, which focused on collaboration
across ministries, supply chain due diligence, access to remedy and the role of NCPs.
NAPs in Adherent countries are in general aligned with OECD work on RBC,
integrating not only the Guidelines, but also the OECD due diligence guidance
instruments and implementation programmes, as well as the role of the NCPs. The
NAP process has thereby reinforced the role of NCPs in promoting policy coherence
across different ministries and government agencies and a number of countries have
included in their NAPs the commitment to strengthening their NCP, to channel
additional resources to it, or both.

3.2.

Policies for enabling responsible business conduct
Societies can benefit from investment in many ways, but the relationship between the
volume of investment and the benefit from that investment is not necessarily linear.
More investment does not automatically lead to productivity growth, more
competitive local firms or a more inclusive workforce. Policymakers worldwide
increasingly recognise the need to balance economic growth objectives with
environmental and social considerations to enhance competitiveness for both
individual businesses and the overall economy. The Policy Framework for
Investment (PFI) reinforces the message that to the extent that governments provide
an enabling environment for businesses to act responsibly and meet their duty to
protect the public interest from potential adverse impacts of business activities, they
are more likely to keep and attract sustainable investment.
Box 6. Recommendation of the Council on the Policy Framework for Investment
Extract from Chapter 7. Policies for enabling responsible business conduct
Governments can promote and enable RBC in several ways through:
"Regulating – establishing and enforcing an adequate legal framework that protects the
public interest and underpins RBC, and monitoring business performance and compliance;
Facilitating – clearly communicating expectations on what constitutes RBC, providing
guidance on specific practices and enabling enterprises to meet those expectations;
Co-operating – working with stakeholders in the business community, worker
organisations,
civil society, the general public, across internal government structures, as well as other
governments to create synergies and establish coherence with regard to RBC;
Promoting – demonstrating support for best practices in RBC;
Exemplifying – behaving responsibly in the government’s role as an economic actor."
Source: OECD, 2015 Policy Framework for Investment 2015,
www.oecd.org/investment/pfi.htm.
The inclusion of RBC as a core element of OECD Investment Policy Reviews
continued in 2017. Following the reviews of Viet Nam, Lao People’s Democratic
Republic (Lao PDR), Cambodia and Ukraine completed in 2016, the review of
Kazakhstan was finalised in 2017 and the reviews of Southeast Asia and Croatia
started. A report on RBC policies and initiatives in the Mediterranean region was
also produced and presented at the regional workshop on Sustainable investment and
responsible business conduct in the Mediterranean, which took place in Cairo, Egypt
on 6-7 November 2017.69 The workshop was organised in the framework of the EUOECD Programme on Promoting Investment in the Mediterranean launched in
October 2016. The governments from emerging and developing economies are
increasingly connecting RBC with various policy areas in practice. For example, the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) has included references to key
RBC concepts in the ASEAN Economic, Socio-Cultural, and Political-Security
Community Blueprints 2025 and has taken specific action on urgent social issues in
the global supply chain.70 Several ASEAN members have also included RBC in their
regulatory framework.71

3. GOVERNMENT POLICIES IN SUPPORT OF RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS CONDUCT

One area where stakeholders have called for further work is on RBC and
international investment treaties.72 Possible areas of work could focus on promoting
peer learning and policy dialogue, and could include updating the 2014 fact-finding
survey on RBC in treaties,73 more empirical analysis on the impacts of treaties,
analysis on enhancing access to remedy in the dispute settlement system, and
analysis for how RBC-related provisions could be improved.
Box 7. Implementing the Policy Framework in Practice – Supporting reforms
in Southeast Asia

Southeast Asia has been one of the most successful emerging regions in terms of
export-led development in part through foreign direct investment (FDI). The region
punches above its weight globally in terms of both exports and FDI inflows and has
been a leading destination for multinational enterprises from all parts of the world for
at least three decades. ASEAN policymakers, in the tradition of leadership as early
movers in welcoming FDI and promoting an export-oriented development strategy,
have already recognised the importance of RBC in certain policy areas. This is true
both at the regional level, as seen by the inclusion of RBC expectations in various
ASEAN Blueprints, but also at the national level, even if specific government actions
vary widely across the region. A promising trend has been the inclusion of RBC
provisions in a recent wave of investment strategies and laws, as well as the
elaboration of comprehensive national action plans related to RBC. Such initiatives
can not only bring about improved outcomes from investment in terms of broader
value creation and sustainable development but can also help to position the region
as a reliable location for production and safe sourcing by helping to reduce the
reputational risks faced by investors.
Nevertheless, more can be done to support and encourage responsible businesses and
quality investment. Several objectives envisioned for the integrated ASEAN
Economic Community will depend in large part on improving the business
environment beyond investment liberalisation. While the export-oriented investment
strategy implemented so far has made ASEAN one of the premier investment
destinations in the world, in many cases it has not always led to lasting local
capabilities. The 2018 OECD Investment Policy Review of Southeast Asia, which
builds on national reviews of seven countries in Southeast Asia and looks at common
challenges across the region and at the interplay between regional initiatives and
national reforms, includes a chapter on how policies that promote and enable RBC
can help achieve these goals.

Links between RBC and other policy areas: moving towards policy coherence

3.3.1.

Public procurement

Governments are the largest consumers in the global marketplace through the
acquisition of goods and services. Public procurement in OECD Member countries
represents on average 12% of GDP and 29% of the national budget,74 with two thirds
of this expenditure occurring at the sub-national levels. Public procurement has been
increasingly used as a policy lever to further government action in many policy areas,
including promoting RBC. Recognising this role, the 2015 Recommendation of the

Council on Public Procurement calls on countries to ensure the strategic and holistic
use of public procurement, including fostering RBC.75
Box 8. Recommendation of the Council on Public Procurement
Relevant extracts




Reference to the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises in the
preamble
Definitions:
- "Primary procurement objective refers to delivering goods and services
necessary to accomplish government mission in a timely, economical and
efficient manner;"
- "Secondary policy objectives refers to any of a variety of objectives such
as sustainable green growth, the development of small and medium-sized
enterprises, innovation, standards for responsible business conduct or
broader industrial policy objectives, which governments increasingly
pursue through use of procurement as a policy lever, in addition to the
primary procurement objective (emphasis added)."



"V. RECOMMENDS that Adherents recognise that any use of the public
procurement system to pursue secondary policy objectives should be
balanced against the primary procurement objective.



To this end, Adherents should (i): evaluate the use of public procurement as
one method of pursuing secondary policy objectives"[…]; (ii) "develop an
appropriate strategy for the integration of secondary policy objectives in
public procurement systems" […]; (iii) employ appropriate impact
assessment methodology to measure the effectiveness of procurement in
achieving secondary policy objectives […]."

Governments have widely recognised public procurement as a lever for achieving
economic, social, and environmental policy goals. Besides Sustainable Development
Goal 12.7 calling for the implementation of sustainable public procurement policies
and action plans, a set of political commitments are in place to provide a framework
for these practices. In addition to OECD instruments, this includes the UN Guiding
Principles76 as well as the revised European Directive on Public Procurement
(Directive 2014/24/EU). Procurement has also been widely taken up in NAPs on
Business and Human Rights, as well as National Action Plans on CSR and RBC, for
example by Germany, Italy, Switzerland, United Kingdom, and the United States.
While in the past value for money meant lowest price, now Governments are
increasingly concerned with the broader impacts of the goods and services they
purchase. However, procurement processes are complex and it can be challenging for
policy-makers to reconcile core procurement principles - transparency, economy,
openness, fairness and competition - with the pursuit of social and environmental
objectives.77
Some national public procurement processes have made a direct link with the OECD
Guidelines or have used OECD tools to clarify the expectations on suppliers to
provide risk assessment and mitigation strategies with regard to potential or actual

adverse impacts of violations in their supply chain, in particular the OECD Due
Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from ConflictAffected and High-Risk Areas.78 However, most human rights, labour and
environmental related provisions limit responsibilities to the first-tier contractor or
supplier but do not take into account environmental, social and human rights related
adverse impacts through supply chains.79
During the session RBC in government procurement practices, held at the GFRBC's
Roundtable for Policy Makers 2017, policy makers discussed the benefits and
challenges related to integrating RBC standards in public procurement. A main takeaway of the session was that strengthened international collaboration among public
buyers may increase leverage for RBC standards. The inclusion of RBC in public
procurement could be advanced by bringing together practitioners to share learning
and best practice, spread tools, exchange information on risks related to certain
products and markets and share information on follow-up and monitoring. The
Secretariat presented the OECD's work on RBC and the outcomes of the Roundtable
to the OECD Working Party of Leading Practitioners on Public Procurement (LPP)
in October 2017. There has been a growing interest to intensify work on RBC and
public procurement and discussions are currently ongoing on how to take this
forward.

3.3.2.

Economic diplomacy

Economic diplomacy refers to government services and support provided to business
in foreign markets. It can take the form of financial support such as export credits,
investment guarantees and direct lending, but also includes other public services such
as trade missions, capacity building activities and access to information and networks
through embassies. These tools are not only instrumental to promote foreign trade
and investment, but they can also be powerful levers for governments to guide
corporate behaviour and support best practice on RBC. Although far from
mainstream, some governments have recognised this potential, for example in their
NAPs, and are using economic diplomacy to create further incentives for business to
behave responsibly.
Since 2003, OECD Member countries have agreed on provisions to consider the
potential environmental, social and human rights impacts of projects for which
official export credits support is requested. The Recommendation of the Council on
Common Approaches for Officially Supported Export Credits and Environmental
and Social Due Diligence (also known as the "Common Approaches") encourages
members, via their Export Credit Agencies (ECAs), to promote the Guidelines,
consider the outcomes of NCP cases when undertaking project reviews, as well as to
give consideration to policy coherence with the Guidelines (see box below).
The majority of ECAs have incorporated reference to the Guidelines within their
policies and actively promote the Guidelines as a tool for responsible business
conduct, most commonly by providing information on their websites. The exceptions
are those that do not provide export credits support for the types of projects falling
within the scope of the Common Approaches. All ECAs also have policies and
procedures in place for considering any statements or reports made publicly available
by their NCPs when undertaking project due diligence. Some ECAs, such as Austria,
Canada, the Netherlands and Slovenia, have reported that they have formal processes
set out in their policy documentation for considering such statements; other ECAs

56 │ 3. GOVERNMENT POLICIES IN SUPPORT OF RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS CONDUCT
rely on informal ad hoc processes on a project by project basis. In addition, ECAs
regularly exchange information with their NCPs or meet with them to discuss cases:
for example, the United States has reported that its ECA, USEXIM, is a member of
the US NCP Interagency Working Group and, as such, participates in regular Group
meetings to discuss specific instances.
In addition to export credits, governments also systematically provide non-financial
services to business to support their trade and investment efforts abroad. In particular
trade missions organised by the government with a view to exploring international
business opportunities presents an opportunity to raise awareness about RBC and
governments can use them as incentive structures to promote corporate
accountability for social, environmental and human rights impacts. At the same time,
governments have direct access to companies operating abroad through their
diplomatic network. Embassies and consulates fulfil a counselling role to these
enterprises, especially in risk and conflict areas where the respect of human rights,
labour and environmental conditions may be threatened.
Government cooperation between home and host countries of trade and investment
also provides an enabling framework for governments to foster RBC standards by
companies operating abroad. Recent examples include the EU-Canada Economic and
Trade Agreement, the EU-Viet Nam Free Trade Agreement and the Free Trade
Agreement between the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) States and
Georgia, which all include provisions on RBC, as well as on sustainable
development, labour and environment. RBC considerations are also part of the
ongoing EU-Mercosur negotiations.80 Labour and environment provisions are also
included in the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific
Partnership (CPTPP) between Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia,
Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore and Viet Nam which was signed in March
2018. To further implementation of RBC provisions, the EU has promoted
implementation through awareness raising activities for stakeholders, notably in May
2017 in the context of the EU-Costa Rica Free Trade Agreements.
The GFRBC's Roundtable for Policy Makers 2017 provided a first opportunity to
discuss different government approaches to economic diplomacy during the session
on Responsible Business Conduct and Economic Diplomacy Tools. Some of the
takeaways of the session where that the most successful models are those that
combine incentives with responsibilities. In parallel, alignment and policy coherence
are critical, i.e. the messaging needs to be the same at all levels of government.

3.3.3.

Corporate governance and State-owned enterprises

Another policy area of importance for the implementation of the Guidelines is
corporate governance. The OECD sets out guidelines for policymakers to evaluate
and improve the legal, regulatory, and institutional framework for corporate
governance, including also for corporate governance of State-Owned Enterprises.
OECD instruments in these areas - the Recommendation of the Council on the
Principles of Corporate Governance and the Recommendation of the Council on
Guidelines on Corporate Governance of State-Owned Enterprises - are aligned with
the expectations of the Guidelines. The OECD Guidelines also recommend that
enterprises apply good corporate governance practices drawn from the G20/OECD
Principles of Corporate Governance.

3. GOVERNMENT POLICIES IN SUPPORT OF RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS CONDUCT

Strong corporate governance and establishing a tone from the top is essential to
ensuring RBC. For example, a survey conducted by PWC found that “nearly 90% of
survey respondents agree that tone from the top is critical in the effective mitigation
of risk to their organisation around fraud, corruption and ethical behaviour.” 81As
such it is recommended that corporate boards take on responsibilities related to RBC.
For example boards will generally be involved in approving an enterprise’s RBC
policies. They may also be involved in taking decisions about a business strategy
which may have implications for RBC. Additionally, they may intervene in instances
where the RBC policies are not being implemented and request management to take
action. It can be useful to appoint board member(s) with expertise on and
responsibility for RBC issues. In this respect, the G20/OECD Principles of Corporate
Governance recognise that an important responsibility of the board of public
enterprises is to oversee the risk management system and systems designed to ensure
RBC (see Box 9).

Box 10. G20/OECD Principles of Corporate Governance

Extract from Chapter IV. The role of stakeholders in corporate governance
A. The rights of stakeholders that are established by law or through mutual
agreements are to be respected.
“The rights of stakeholders are often established by law (e.g. labour, business,
commercial, environmental, and insolvency laws) or by contractual relations that
companies must respect. Nevertheless, even in areas where stakeholder interests are
not legislated, many firms make additional commitments to stakeholders, and
concern over corporate reputation and corporate performance often requires the
recognition of broader interests. For multinational enterprises, this may in some
jurisdictions be achieved by companies using the OECD Guidelines for Multinational
Enterprises for due diligence procedures that address the impact of such
commitments (emphasis added).”
Extract from Chapter V. Disclosure and transparency
“Disclosure also helps improve public understanding of the structure and activities of
enterprises, corporate policies and performance with respect to environmental and
ethical standards, and companies’ relationships with the communities in which they
operate. The OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises may, in many
jurisdictions be relevant for multinational enterprises (emphasis added).”
Extract from Chapter VI. The responsibilities of the board
“Another important board responsibility is to oversee the risk management system
and systems designed to ensure that the corporation obeys applicable laws, including
tax, competition, labour, environmental, equal opportunity, health and safety laws. In
some countries, companies have found it useful to explicitly articulate the
responsibilities that the board assumes and those for which management is
accountable.”
“The board should apply high ethical standards. It should take into account the
interests of stakeholders. High ethical standards are in the long term interests of the
company as a means to make it credible and trustworthy, not only in day-to-day
operations but also with respect to longer term commitments. To make the objectives
of the board clear and operational, many companies have found it useful to develop
company codes of conduct based on, inter alia, professional standards and sometimes
broader codes of behaviour, and to communicate them throughout the organisation.
The latter might include a voluntary commitment by the company (including its
subsidiaries) to comply with the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises
which reflect all four principles contained in the ILO Declaration on Fundamental
Principles and Rights at Work (emphasis added).”
Additionally, recognising that good corporate governance also means recognising
broader stakeholder and societal interests is crucial. This may mean taking into
account external harms and long term value drivers, which include environmental,
social and governance issues. For institutions acting in a fiduciary capacity, such as
pension funds, collective investment schemes and some activities of insurance
ANNUAL REPORT ON THE OECD GUIDELINES FOR MULTINATIONAL ENTERPRISES 2017 © OECD 2018

-----------------------Page 60 End-----------------------

3. GOVERNMENT POLICIES IN SUPPORT OF RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS CONDUCT

companies, and asset managers acting on their behalf, this may mean recognising that
“failing to consider long-term investment value drivers, which include
environmental, social and governance issues, in investment practice is a failure of
fiduciary duty”82 (see also Chapter 2, financial sector).
Lastly, corporate reporting to the public on environmental and social issues as well as
due diligence processes is an important aspect of corporate governance as it allows
both shareholders and the broader public understand material risks associated with a
company’s activities. However of the estimated 80 000 multinational companies in
the world, only around 5 000-10 000 are estimated to publish environmental and
social performance reports83 (see section below on disclosure for more information).
In 2014, 22.8% of Global Fortune 500 companies were state-owned, compared with
9.8% in 2005.84 SOE activities have traditionally been domestically-focused (e.g.
public utilities), but over the past decade, SOEs have also rapidly internationalised
and are also deepening their commercial links in the global supply chains.85
RBC expectations are applicable to SOEs. The MNE Guidelines apply to all entities
within the enterprise and all sectors whether private, state or mixed. The PFI also
recognises that governments should lead by example on RBC in their own role
within the economy and ensure that the practices of state-owned enterprises
exemplify RBC.
The Recommendation of the Council on Guidelines on Corporate Governance of
State-Owned Enterprises recommends that the state ownership policy fully recognise
SOE responsibilities towards stakeholders and request that SOEs report on their
relations with stakeholders, as well as to make clear any expectations the state has in
respect of RBC by SOEs. The SOE Guidelines further recommend (and rely on the
Board of Directors to the executive management) extensive measures to report on
foreseeable risks, including in the areas human rights, labour, the environment, and
risks related to corruption and taxation (see box 11).
However, so far there has been limited research on RBC practices of SOEs and on
how and if the state is implementing RBC and ownership policy objectives. A 2016
report by the UN Working Group on Business and Human Rights that examined the
issue found that there is a general lack of attention to RBC issues and that policies,
guidelines and good practices are lacking at both the international and national
levels.86 During the session RBC and State-owned enterprises held at the 2017
GFRBC, panellists argued that more research is needed in this area, which would
also be important for ensuring a level-playing field for private enterprises which are
expected to follow RBC principles and standards. Making RBC expectations clear
and in the context of a transparent ownership rationale is a role and an opportunity
for governments.
The OECD Working Party on State Ownership and Privatisation (WPSOPP)
organised an exchange on RBC following the GFRBC on 23 October 2017 as part a
special roundtable on Integrity, the fight against corruption and responsible business
conduct in the SOE sector, where the Chair of the WPRBC and the Chair of the UN
Working Group on Business and Human Rights were invited to present on RBC.
Further research on RBC and SOEs and strengthened dialogue between the different
policy communities were identified as possible next steps.

Box 11. Recommendation of the Council on Guidelines
on Corporate Governance of State-Owned Enterprises

Extract of Chapter V Stakeholder Relations and Responsible Business
The state ownership policy should fully recognise SOEs’ responsibilities towards
stakeholders and request that SOEs report on their relations with stakeholders. It
should make clear any expectations the state has in respect of responsible business
conduct by SOEs.
Governments, the state ownership entities and SOEs themselves should recognise
and respect stakeholders’ rights established by law or through mutual agreements.
Listed or large SOEs should report on stakeholder relations, including where relevant
and feasible with regard to labour, creditors and affected communities.
The boards of SOEs should develop, implement, monitor and communicate internal
controls, ethics and compliance programmes or measures, including those which
contribute to preventing fraud and corruption. They should be based on country
norms, in conformity with international commitments and apply to the SOE and its
subsidiaries.
SOEs should observe high standards of responsible business conduct. Expectations
established by the government in this regard should be publicly disclosed and
mechanisms for their implementation be clearly established.
SOEs should not be used as vehicles for financing political activities. SOEs
themselves should not make political campaign contributions.

3.3.4.

Disclosure

The demand for more transparency and information on how companies deal with
human rights, environmental, social and other "non-financial" issues has rapidly
grown. A particular trend is increasing demand of information on how companies are
identifying and addressing impacts in their supply chains. On 26 June 2017, the EU
released Guidelines on non-financial reporting to enhance business transparency on
social and environmental matters,87 which supplement the already existing EU rules on
non-financial reporting (Directive 2014/95/EU). The EU Guidelines are based on and
reference the OECD Guidelines throughout, as well as the sector-specific OECD due
diligence guidance instruments. In 2017 the Task Force on Climate-related Financial
Disclosures (TCFD), an industry-led initiative developed a set of recommendations for
voluntary climate-related financial disclosures. 88
The disclosure recommendations of the Guidelines call for timely and accurate
disclosure on all material matters regarding the corporation, including the financial
situation, performance, ownership and governance of the company. The Guidelines
also encourage a second set of disclosure or communication practices in areas where
reporting standards are still evolving such as, for example, social, environmental and
risk reporting.89 Additionally reporting on due diligence is an integral step of the due
diligence process and has been recognised in legislation introduced in the UK and
France, as well as under the EU Guidelines. For example, EU importers of tin,
tungsten, tantalum and gold covered by Regulation (EU) 2017/821 will have to

3. GOVERNMENT POLICIES IN SUPPORT OF RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS CONDUCT

publicly report on their supply chain due diligence policies and practices for
responsible sourcing for these metals and minerals.
These developments are generating a shift from traditional, voluntary and sometimes
"PR-oriented" corporate reporting toward more meaningful and user-oriented
disclosure. This was also addressed as part of the 2017 GFRBC session on Lessons
from the Climate Agenda.90 The OECD also organised a side event on Mainstreaming
climate disclosure in OECD Member countries in November 2017 during the 23rd
Conference of the Parties (COP23) at Bonn, jointly with the Institute for Global
Environmental Strategies (IGES). The event discussed key challenges and priorities
to ensure reporting and disclosure frameworks incorporate climate factors, and that
information is incorporated by institutional investors in their investment decisions. It
furthermore addressed how climate disclosure can be used as a tool for investors to
influence corporations' business strategies. Several participants also stressed the role
of policy makers and made clear calls for OECD to support progress on climate
disclosure.
In December of 2017 the OECD organised a workshop on Corporate Disclosure and
Responsible Business Conduct. Participants called on policy makers to encourage
corporate disclosure on RBC issues (including on climate change and human rights),
and on the OECD to further engage on corporate disclosure, both as a convener and
standard-setter, including to: help implement the TCFD recommendations on climate
disclosure; and clarify issues associated with disclosure of climate change, human
rights and other RBC issues for investors and corporations.
3.4.

Conclusion and other pertinent areas of work
This Chapter demonstrates how RBC issues are linked to a range of policy areas and
how this has been taken up by other OECD policy communities. While discussions
on investment and trade have long been associated with the corporate responsibility
agenda, RBC principles and standards are also increasingly finding their way into
other fields of public policy such as public procurement and disclosure. In this
context the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the
17 Sustainable Development Goals also encourage governments to design and
implement policies which lead to responsible and sustainable outcomes by the
private and public sector and reinforce the message for policy coherence for RBC.
The SDGs have also brought to the fore other policy areas relevant for RBC, such as
development finance and infrastructure development. Moreover to support policy
action on RBC, measuring impact and collecting evidence that RBC delivers better
outcomes is key. Different streams of work at the OECD have contributed this effort.

3.4.1.

Implementation of the SDGs

Stakeholders at the 2017 Global Forum on RBC called on the OECD to make the
link between RBC and development co-operation goals and finance, particularly in
the context of the implementation of the SDGs. There are a number of synergies in
this area. For example, development practitioners can have an important role in
promoting and enabling RBC, and RBC practitioners can bring in expertise on multistakeholder platforms and on engaging with the private sector in the context of
promoting private sector involvement in the implementation of the SDGs. One area
where promoting and enabling RBC could be particularly beneficial is infrastructure.
Investment needs to implement the SDGs are in the trillions of dollars and cannot be

met solely through public financing. Mobilising the private sector will be a crucial
element of the SDGs success, not only in terms of delivery but also financing and
partnerships. However, the development benefits of infrastructure investment
depend, inter alia, on how potential and actual negative impacts are addressed.
Infrastructure projects are complex, with long supply chains and multiple
stakeholders, and are highly vulnerable to corruption, as well as social and
environmental risks.
OECD instruments like the Policy Framework for Investment (PFI) and the
Recommendation of the Council on Principles for Private Sector Participation in
Infrastructure explicitly encourage governments to ensure that businesses
participating in projects meet RBC standards, such as the Guidelines. Meaningfully
integrating environmental and social issues across all steps of the infrastructure
project life-cycle, becomes as much of an economic incentive as a broad
sustainability goal for both governments and businesses involved in the financing
and delivery of infrastructure.

3.4.2.

Measuring impacts

There is increasing evidence that acting responsibly is not just a matter of
compliance but also has a win-win outcome: that sustainable supply chains and better
financial performance can go hand in hand and that one can drive the other.
Numerous studies, including at the OECD, show that responsible business is often
also good business.91 RBC can help with increasing returns, lowering cost of capital,
and retaining employees; reducing costs and avoiding legal liability. For example,
one study found that better business practices have the potential to reduce the cost of
debt for companies by 40% or more and increase revenue by up to 20%.92 More
broadly, a cross-sector study tracking performance of companies over 18 years found
that high sustainability companies – that is those with strong environmental, social,
and governance (ESG) systems and practices in place – outperform low sustainability
companies in stock performance and real accounting terms.93 OECD results from a
panel regression study with over 6 500 observations lend support to the proposition
that investing in and implementing RBC practices throughout the supply chain
enhances financial performance in the long-run, on average, while supporting social
goals. The study examined the issue of RBC and the financial performance of
companies (return on equity and return on assets) and controlling for value chain
structure, economic and financial factors, the overwhelming finding is that the social
score (a measure of a company's capacity to generate trust and loyalty with its
workforce, customers and society) has a highly-significant positive effect on
companies’ return on equity and return on assets.94
A number of initiatives at the OECD are looking at how to measure impact better.
For example, the project on Measuring Business Impact on Well-being95 is a new
strand of work that aims to create a common base of understanding on how to
measure the impact of businesses on well-being, and how to compare the existing
tools and frameworks. Additionally, the OECD has established an Inclusive Growth
and Business network96 with the objective to bring in businesses in the global efforts
to tackle inequality, increase prosperity, and ensure that the benefits of growth are
widely shared. The RBC dimension is included in both these projects.97

In this context, so-called "green" public procurement, whereby authorities seek to procure
goods, services and public works with a reduced environmental impact throughout their lifecycle, is particularly advanced. More recently, green procurement efforts have been taken up
as part of sustainable procurement, which pursues economic, environmental and social
objectives.

70 │ ANNEX 1

Annex 1.
Opinion piece by Roel Nieuwenkamp,
Chair of the Working Party
on Responsible Business Conduct
Accountability and leading by example
In this Annual Report 2017 I would like to convey two messages to governments and
the OECD: ‘show the effectiveness of NCPs' and 'practice what you preach'. These
messages touch on several aspects of corporate responsibility policies. As this report
is a part of an accountability mechanism to the OECD Council I will start with the
first.

Demonstrate the effectiveness of NCPs
One of the unique features of the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises is
that, through the Decision attached to the Guidelines, they include a legally binding
commitment for Adherent countries to promote responsible business conduct and to
set up ‘National Contact Points’ (NCPs). Most Adherent countries are implementing
this commitment. But do we know if we are successful? Yes and no. For a couple of
years we have had some figures in the Annual Report that are good performance
indicators of the NCP mechanism. In particular in this report, the finding that 83% of
successful mediated agreements out of all specific instances for which mediation was
offered in 2017 is an impressive figure. However this does not give a complete
picture of the success of the NCP mechanism. As responsible business authorities,
NCPs promote the Guidelines and also provide recommendations to business on how
to apply the Guidelines when dealing with cases.
We need facts and figures to demonstrate the effectiveness of the NCP system. The
motto ‘Be good and tell it’ is important for a responsible business mechanism like
this. A distinction can be made between performance indicators that show how
effective an NCP is and key indicators that show important characteristics of the
NCP and its context.
NCPs have two tasks: handling cases relating to alleged violations of the Guidelines
and promotion of the Guidelines.

Performance indicators for handling of specific instances
An already existing important performance indicator is the % of cases where
mediation was offered that led to an agreement. This is essential to assess the
performance of the NCP system, but it only captures part of the work, as NCPs in
many cases also make recommendations in cases where mediation fails or a company
refuses mediation. Often companies act upon these recommendations. Take the good
examples of the French Michelin case1 and the Danish PWT case.2 The recent

-----------------------Page 72 End-----------------------

ANNEX 1.

German NCP peer review showed that even without an agreement, companies
implemented the recommendations of the NCP.
Therefore a useful performance indicator would be: % of cases where mediation was
refused or failed that had significant positive RBC results. Many NCPs now evaluate
implementation of their recommendations after a year, so this essential, but
qualitative information will be available increasingly in the future.

Performance indicators for promotion by NCPs
The other key task of NCPs is to promote the Guidelines. How do NCPs know
whether they are effective in their promotion of RBC? Several NCPs have started
measuring this. Two key performance indicators are emerging: % awareness of
companies of the OECD Guidelines and % companies committing to follow the
OECD Guidelines. Some NCPs have measured this and some are planning to do it. I
would encourage all NCPs to start measuring this.

Other key indicators
There are also some key indicators that are important to know more about the NCP,
but do not tie per se with performance. Important indicators are: % of companies that
accept an offer of good offices (mediation or conciliation). This shows the
willingness of companies to participate in the NCP process. It is therefore an
indicator of business confidence in the good offices of NCPs.
Another key indicator is: % of cases that are accepted for further examination. This
is in fact not a performance indicator, since acceptance or dismissals can be valid
decisions in specific cases. For NCPs which receive a lot of insufficiently
substantiated cases, this rate will be low, but this does not qualify the functioning of
the NCP. It may for example indicate that the NCP could target its promotional
activities to include raising awareness about its non-judicial grievance mechanism
and what types of cases can be submitted to NCPs.
Stakeholder confidence is key to the success of an NCP. The Procedural Guidance
states that the NCP should retain the confidence of social partners and other
stakeholders. Therefore a key indicator is: The level of confidence by stakeholders in
the NCP (qualitative). At this moment the best proxy indicator available would be
whether all stakeholders are represented in the institutional arrangements of the NCP,
in an advisory body or as part of a tripartite or independent NCP. This provides at
least some indication of confidence, but this does not necessarily translate into full
confidence in the NCP. I encourage all NCPs and the OECD to develop and measure
qualitative indicators that indicate high/ medium/ low/ or no confidence levels.
I hope that in the future a useful scorecard could be provided for all NCPs that
consist of the above-mentioned (K)PIs. Such a scorecard would also be essential for
NCP peer reviewers and accountability to the OECD Council.

72 │ ANNEX 1

Practice what you preach
Many governments have made strong high level statements about policy coherence
for responsible business conduct. They call on corporate responsibility to be
embedded in government procurement and in economic diplomacy instruments, and
encourage state-owned enterprises to lead by example.
In the area of export credit agencies there was significant progress with the ‘OECD
Common Approaches’ which recommend that ECAs should promote the OECD
Guidelines with their clients and that they should take into account NCP statements.
Canada and Germany link the granting of economic diplomacy support to good faith
engagement by the company in the NCP process. Other governments are looking into
this.
Responsible public procurement is one of the areas where more progress can be
made. United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 12 deals with “Ensuring
sustainable consumption and production patterns” and its Target 12.7 refers to the
need to “Promote public procurement practices that are sustainable, in accordance
with national policies and priorities”. Implementation and more concrete government
action is needed to ensure responsibilities extend beyond the first-tier contractor or
supplier to take into account environmental, social and human rights related adverse
impacts throughout the entire supply chain of procured goods.
The OECD has developed a range of tools for businesses on how to conduct riskbased due diligence on human rights, labour standards and environmental aspects in
their supply chains. It is time for governments to implement this in their own supply
chains, too. They should lead by example. State-owned enterprises should be
spearheading this effort and public procurement needs to follow state of the art
corporate responsibility standards. Some governments are taking significant steps in
this regard, such as Sweden, but most are still lagging behind. As there is a strong
need for a level playing field, the OECD is well positioned to move this emerging
area of work forward through the WPRBC and the OECD Working Party on Leading
Practitioners of Procurement to join forces on this emerging area of work. The
OECD due diligence guidance instruments provide concrete tools to take this
forward.

Annex 3. Italy, Switzerland and France NCP peer
review reports: Key findings and recommendations
Peer review of the National Contact Point of Italy
Institutional Arrangements
Findings

Recommendations

1.1

The NCP’s position within the Ministry of
Economic Development (MED) has been effective
in raising the profile of its work and in developing
relationships with Italian enterprises, relevant
government agencies and other stakeholders. At
the same time there is room to increase visibility of
the work of the NCP within the Ministry.

The NCP should consider establishing direct
communication channels with the office of the
Minister of Economic Development in order to further
increase its visibility.

1.2

Not all members of the NCP Committee are
equally active. Some members of the NCP
Committee do not have a strong awareness of the
activities of the NCP.

The NCP should consider reforming the NCP
Committee to ensure it is practical and effective. For
example, the NCP Committee could reduce its
membership to create a more efficient and engaged
advisory body. A smaller yet still representative
committee could play a stronger advisory role. The
members of the current NCP Committee could
continue to meet and exchange views on RBC
biannually, or as appropriate.

Promotional activities

2.1

Findings

Recommendations

Despite the strong promotional efforts of the NCP,
there is a low awareness of the grievance
mechanism function of the NCP amongst
stakeholders.

The NCP should look for more opportunities to
promote the function of the NCP as a grievance
mechanism within its current promotional activities.

Specific instances
3

3.1

Findings

Recommendations

The NCP Committee is a large body that
formally meets twice a year, which could make it
challenging to provide feedback on specific
instances as they arise

The NCP should consider developing a more flexible
and reactive mechanism to provide technical advice to
the NCP Secretariat and ensure that specific instances
are handled in an efficient manner, for example by
setting up ad hoc subcommittee(s).

ANNUAL REPORT ON THE OECD GUIDELINES FOR MULTINATIONAL ENTERPRISES 2017 © OECD 2018

-----------------------Page 78 End-----------------------

ANNEX 3.

3.2

Certain aspects of the current rules of procedure
of the NCP are based upon the NCP’s discretion
and the current indicative time frame of one
month for initial assessment is not sufficient for
this phase of the process.

│ 77

The NCP should consider modifying the rules of
procedure to ensure that the initial assessment phase
is:
1) more predictable, by avoiding procedures which
rely on the NCP’s discretion
2) easier to implement, by extending the one month
initial assessment period to three months as
provided by the Procedural Guidance of the
Guidelines, while retaining the possibility for
submitters to reformulate their

3.3

In two specific instances where the NCP has
been involved in a supporting role Italian parties
noted they would have appreciated additional
communication from the NCP.

The NCP could play a more active role when it acts as
a supporting NCP by informing the parties of the
procedure and relevant developments. This provides
an opportunity to further promote the Guidelines.

Peer review of the National Contact Point of Switzerland
Institutional Arrangements
Findings

Recommendations

1.1

The role of the Advisory Board is still being
developed and the status of its advice with respect
to the activities of the NCP is not fully clear.

The NCP could consider clarifying the role and
authority of the Advisory Board, particularly in
relation to the status of the advice it provides with
respect to specific instances.

1.2

The contribution of ad hoc working groups to the
specific instance process is unclear, not always
visible to parties and adds a procedural burden to
the process.

The NCP should consider whether ad hoc working
groups should play a more active and visible role in
specific instances or, alternatively, whether their role
could be streamlined to make it less procedurally
onerous.

Promotional activities
Findings

Recommendations

2.1

Civil society groups, particularly NGOs, seem
less aware of the value of the specific instance
mechanism and the activities of the NCP.

The NCP could focus more attention on awareness
raising and relationship building with civil society. In
this respect specific promotional events could be
planned with civil society groups, particularly NGOs, to
explain the potential benefits of the specific instance
mechanism. The Advisory Board, which includes civil
society representatives, could be instrumental in these
outreach efforts.

2.2

The NCP promotes the Guidelines through
participating in external events and strategic
initiatives but does not organise many of its own
promotional events.

The NCP could be more proactive with respect to
promotion by organising its own promotional events
and activities

-----------------------Page 79 End-----------------------

78 │ ANNEX 3.

Specific instances
Findings

Recommendations

3.1

The NCP as well as users of the system have
identified the length of specific instance
proceedings as an ongoing challenge.

The NCP could consider streamlining processes,
specifically with respect to information gathering
during the phase between submission and initial
assessment to reduce the time involved.

3.2

Several stakeholders noted that final statements
could be made more substantive in order to
demonstrate the full added value of the specific
instance mechanism to civil society and other
parties, to encourage greater use of the specific
instance mechanism.

The NCP could consider developing final statements
which include more meaningful recommendations
and make efforts to encourage the parties to report
agreed to actions relevant to better observing the
Guidelines.

Peer review of the National Contact Point of France
Institutional arrangements
Findings

Recommendations

1.1

Despite the strong representation provided
by the tripartite structure, MEDEF is the only
business representative in the NCP, whereas
worker organisations are represented by six
different trade unions and there are four
government representatives from different
ministries.

The NCP should ensure a balanced representation to
promote diversity of perspectives within its structure.

1.2

Some NCP member organisations do not play
an‌active‌role‌in‌achieving‌the‌NCP’s‌mandate.‌
In addition, one NCP member organisation does
not advocate using the NCP to settle disputes
within the framework of specific instances.

All NCP members should be encouraged to play an
active and constructive role in successfully
achieving‌the‌NCP’s‌mandate.‌‌

1.3

The NCP seems to be lacking the necessary
human and financial resources to sustain the
high level of its activities and services over the
long term, most of which are performed by the
Secretariat.

In order to maintain, and even build on, the current
high level of activities and services offered by the
NCP,‌the‌human‌resources‌in‌the‌NCP’s‌Secretariat‌
should be increased, and the Secretariat should be
allocated the financial resources required to ensure
the proper functioning and achievement of its
objectives.

-----------------------Page 80 End-----------------------

ANNEX 3.

│ 79

Promotional activities
Findings

Recommendations

2.1

Civil society organisations, and NGOs in
particular, do not seem very aware of the
potential benefits of using‌ the‌ NCP’s‌
procedure for specific instances. The 2014
revision of the Bylaw, followed by the
adoption of the communication plan in 2015,
provided for a specific annual meeting with
NGOs. That said, this meeting did not take
place in 2015 and 2016.

The NCP is encouraged to continue its work with
NGOs with a view to establishing a regular
dialogue so as to improve their confidence in the
NCP’s‌specific‌instance mechanism.

2.2

Despite the fact that the Secretariat is very
active in promoting the Guidelines and the NCP
to external stakeholders, they both still appear
to be relatively unfamiliar to NCP member
organisations and networks.

The less active NCP members should be more
involved in promoting the Guidelines and the NCP
within their respective organisations and networks.

Specific instances
Findings

Recommendations

3.1

The Guidelines and Bylaw (Art. 27) provide
that the NCP may propose and facilitate
access to consensual and non-adversarial
means, such as conciliation or mediation, to
assist the parties in resolving their problems.
Of the 14 specific instances for which good
offices were offered, mediation was
successfully undertaken on one occasion,
and there was discussion and exchange
between the parties on two occasions.

When a specific instance is accepted for further
examination, it is recommended that the NCP
facilitate discussion and exchange between the
parties as early as possible.

3.2

Clarity around some aspects of the procedure
for handling specific instances could be
improved to promote predictability. In particular:

In order to strengthen the predictability of
communication on the procedure for handling
specific instances, the NCP is encouraged to specify
the different phases in its procedure, including the
planned exchanges with the enterprise and the
types of processes or support that are envisioned in
the offer of good offices and mediation. A diagram to
explain the procedure in simple terms could be
developed and‌posted‌on‌the‌NCP’s‌website.

- If and under what circumstances the
enterprise is consulted during the initial
assessment phase;
- The types of processes or support which are
proposed‌under‌‘good‌offices’;
- What does mediation look like and under what
circumstances it can be proposed to parties

3.3

There may be conflict of interest, or the
appearance of conflict of interest, when a
specific instance is submitted by an NCP
member organisation or when a member finds
themselves in a situation of conflict of interest.
The NCP does not have formal policies on how
to proceed in this situation.

The NCP should formalise the practice of having an
NCP member withdraw from the procedure for
handling a specific instance when conflict of interest,
or the appearance of conflict of interest, arises. In
particular, NCP members should declare any
conflict of interest, or appearance of conflict of
interest, which is likely to impact the handling of a
specific instance.

ANNEX 4.

Annex 4. Statements by institutional stakeholders
Business and Industry Advisory Committee (BIAC)
Business, as represented by Business at OECD (BIAC), has long recognized the
importance of responsible business conduct in a globalized world. BIAC considers
responsible business conduct, as promoted by the MNE Guidelines, to be an essential part
of an open investment climate and in the best interest of business.
To that end, BIAC is working closely with its member organizations and multinational
enterprises in order to raise the visibility of the MNE Guidelines by participating in
events and raising awareness in regular online communications. In 2017, BIAC updated
its brochure on the MNE Guidelines, which was issued to ensure that companies are
aware of this key instrument and its concrete implications for business. The updated
brochure was distributed to our wider membership, which includes the major national
business and employers’ organizations from OECD member countries and a number of
non-member countries as well as over 40 international sector organizations.
On 28 June 2017, BIAC organized a high-level business seminar on the OECD MNE
Guidelines and the National Contact Point procedure. The meeting brought together close
to 50 RBC business experts from major multinational companies around the world. The
seminar included a joint session with TUAC, OECD Watch and the OECD’s Deputy
Secretary General as well as a business only session where companies shared their
specific experience with the NCP system. The meeting was organized in the light of the
increasing importance of the NCP system and to provide a platform for business leaders
to share their experience regarding the functioning of the NCP procedure in practice.
BIAC also highlighted the importance of the MNE Guidelines in other international
discussions, including in the context of the B20, where BIAC was an active member of
the B20 employment and education task force as well as the B20 working group on anticorruption and responsible business conduct. The importance of the MNE Guidelines was
duly underlined in the final B20 reports.
BIAC maintained a strong presence at the annual OECD Global Forum on Responsible
Business Conduct in June 2017. BIAC also remained an active partner in the proactive
agenda project to ensure that the concrete experience of different sectors, including
finance, textiles, as well as food and agriculture, is duly reflected. BIAC members also
participated in the Forum on Responsible Mineral Supply Chains.
Throughout the year, BIAC actively contributed to the discussions on the draft OECD
general due diligence guidance underlining that the final outcome must be of practical use
to business, recognising both business opportunities and challenges in this context. BIAC
participated in consultations with the Working Party on Responsible Business Conduct,
NCPs and RBC policy makers.
Our member organizations were also actively involved in the peer reviews of their
respective NCPs.

Trade Union Advisory Committee (TUAC)
In 2017, the Trade Union Advisory Committee to the OECD (TUAC), working with its
affiliates and trade union partners, undertook a range of activities directed at achieving

ANNUAL REPORT ON THE OECD GUIDELINES FOR MULTINATIONAL ENTERPRISES 2017 © OECD 2018

│ 81

-----------------------Page 83 End-----------------------

82 │ ANNEX 4.
the effective implementation of the OECD Guidelines through well-resourced and
accountable National Contact Points (NCPs). Trade unions have also supported the
OECD in its efforts to establish a common understanding of due diligence and to promote
its implementation.
On country peer reviews and accession, TUAC participated in four out of five peer
reviews held in 2017 (Austria, France, Germany, US), together with its affiliates, and
held discussions with CUT-Chile on the Chilean peer review. TUAC undertook a mission
to Costa Rica in the context of Costa Rica’s OECD Accession. It met with representatives
of the Costa Rican NCP and other Ministries, and held information sessions to raise trade
union awareness of the role of the Costa Rican NCP. TUAC and the International Trade
Union Confederation (ITUC) continued to highlight the ongoing repression of trade union
rights in Kazakhstan, in the context of Kazakhstan’s adherence to the OECD Guidelines.
TUAC provided training on the OECD Guidelines and due diligence to trade unionists
around the world: Stockholm, meeting for Swedish trade unions, also attended by the
Swedish NCP (Union to Union); Berlin, international trade union meeting on global
supply chains (DGB) and a meeting on the German National Action Plan (FES); Brussels,
meeting of the Pan European Regional Council (PERC); Yangon, regional meeting for
trade unions from the textile sector in South East Asia (IndustriALL); Guatemala City,
regional meeting for trade unionists from the textile sector in Latin America
(IndustriALL); Santiago, training workshop on the Guidelines for Chilean trade unionists,
also attended by the Chilean NCP (CUT-CHILE, FES, TUAC); Paris, international trade
union workshop on due diligence, including a presentation from the OECD Secretariat on
the Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains in the Garment and Footwear
Sector (TUAC-ITUC).
TUAC was also a panellist at promotional events organised by NCPs and the OECD: an
information exchange workshop involving representatives of Works Councils of Austrian
Multinational Enterprises, organised by the Austrian NCP; a seminar of the OECD
MENA Programme on Boosting SMEs for Diversification, Inclusion and Resilience in
the MENA region, co-hosted by the Italian NCP; and the OECD Session ‘Lessons
Learned from the OECD NCP Peer Review Process’ held at the UN Forum on Business
and Human Rights.
On due diligence, TUAC, the ITUC, UNI Global Union, the AFL-CIO and the Korean
Metal Workers' Union were members of the Advisory Group for the cross-sectoral due
diligence guidance; TUAC, UN Global Union, AFL-CIO AND UIL were on the
Advisory Group for the Financial Sector; and TUAC, IndustriALL and UNI Global
Union were part of the Advisory Group for Responsible Supply Chains in Garments and
Footwear. IndustriALL was strongly represented at the launch of the Garment and
Footwear Guidance, at the 2017 Roundtable, and is working with the OECD in the
implementation phase with regard to building trade union capacity on due diligence.
Throughout 2017, TUAC provided support to trade unions around the world in submitting
cases under the OECD Guidelines, maintained its database on trade unions cases,1 and

continued to disseminate its Trade Union Guide to the Guidelines, which is currently
available in 14 languages.2

OECD Watch
As a network of over 100 civil society organizations from around the world, OECD
Watch continues to monitor the effectiveness of National Contact Points (NCPs) in
promoting corporate adherence to the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises
(the Guidelines) and access to remedy for victims of corporate misconduct.
2017 marked the launch of OECD Watch’s ‘Remedy is the Reason’ campaign, a
coordinated international effort to ensure all governments that adhere to the OECD
Guidelines honour their binding commitment to establish effective NCPs. The campaign
aims to improve the effectiveness of NCPs so that the NCP system can provide effective
access to remedy for victims of business related human rights abuses.
As part of the November 2017 campaign launch, OECD Watch made history by filing the
first ever ‘substantiated submission’ to the OECD’s Investment Committee regarding the
failure of an NCP, in this case the Australian NCP, to fulfil its obligations under the
OECD Guidelines’ Procedural Guidance. OECD Watch challenged the Australian NCP’s
poor handling of a case filed against G4S for human rights violations that occurred in an
Australian detention centre located in Papua New Guinea.
OECD Watch was also very active in NCP peer review processes in 2017. OECD Watch
participated in all four 2017 NCP peer reviews by providing concrete recommendations
aimed at improving civil society confidence in the NCP and improving the various NCPs’
performance in providing access to remedy and actually resolving disputes related to
companies’ failure to observe the OECD Guidelines.
In addition, OECD Watch teamed up with the International Corporate Accountability
Roundtable (ICAR) to research and evaluate the overall NCP peer review process in an
effort to ensure that the NCP peer reviews lead to advancing and strengthening the NCP
system. Based on research on the peer reviews of the Belgium, Danish, Italian and Swiss
NCPs, we published an interim report in November 2017 to inform discussions on how
to maximize the value of the peer review process for all stakeholders.
OECD Watch continues to support communities and civil society groups to use the
OECD Guidelines by filing specific instance complaints with NCPs through training
workshops. In 2017, OECD Watch conducted such capacity building workshops for civil
society organisations in Poland, the Czech Republic, Kenya and Tanzania. OECD Watch
also provided technical advice to (potential) complainants. For example, with OECD
Watch’s assistance, 168 former employees of Heineken in the DRC engaged in a
successful process of mediation facilitated by the Dutch NCP. This complaint marked the
first-time monetary compensation was provided to remediate past harms as a direct result
of an NCP procedure. OECD Watch provided similar support to complainants in over a
dozen other specific instance complaints in 2017.
Finally, OECD Watch continued to coordinate civil society input and submissions related
to the OECD’s Proactive Agenda and participated in the Advisory Groups formed around

various proactive agenda projects. OECD Watch’s efforts in 2017 focused on developing
due diligence guidance for institutional investors and commercial banks, and the general
Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Business Conduct.

Update on Regional Projects on RBC
Asia
Under a project on responsible supply chains in Asia developed by the European Union
together with the International Labour Organization (ILO) and the OECD, the OECD - in
close co-operation with country authorities and under the auspices of the WPRBC, - will
be working with five non-Member countries, China, Thailand, Viet Nam, Philippines, and
Myanmar, as well as with Japan, to promote responsible supply chains. This project will
focus on risks related to labour rights, human rights, and environment in supply chains,
and will include research, capacity building, outreach and events, and policy support.
Additionally, it will allow for sharing of experiences on the ground as related to the
Guidelines, particularly considering that Japan, an OECD Member, has extensive ties and
business networks in most countries concerned. Negotiation of the project has been
concluded in December 2017 and implementation of the project has started in 2018.1

Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC)
A new work stream on RBC in LAC will start in 2018, developed by the EU and to be
implemented in cooperation with the ILO.2 The focus of the overall project will be
primarily on providing support for the design and implementation of National Action
Plans on RBC/Business and Human Rights, and on capacity building for companies to
implement due diligence. The project, to be implemented over a period of 4 years, covers
the following countries: Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Mexico, Panama,
and Peru, although further countries may be added at a later stage.3 The project will
support, inter alia, work by the OECD on capacity building for enabling policy
frameworks for RBC; strengthening of the National Contact Points in the LAC region;
dissemination of, and support for the implementation of OECD due diligence guidance in
various sectors, and experience sharing among companies in the implementation of RBC.
