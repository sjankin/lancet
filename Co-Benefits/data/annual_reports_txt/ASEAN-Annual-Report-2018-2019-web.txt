           foreword

           A shared vision of peace and prosperity for our people has been the hallmark of
           the Association of southeast Asian nations (AseAn) since its inception more
           than a half century ago.

           in 2018, various initiatives and activities to boost regional cooperation in
           political-security, economic integration, and socio-cultural development-the
           core business of AseAn community-were channelled through the AseAn
           secretariat (Asec). All these, and more, have reinforced Asec’s primary
           role as a coordinator of AseAn organs in the delivery of AseAn projects
           and activities.

           Shifts and the rise of significant trends regionally and globally increasingly
           call for a collective response from AseAn. in turn, regional efforts
           among AseAn member states, supported by Asec in addressing several
           developments, such as the emergence of the Indo-Pacific region, as well
           as the Fourth industrial revolution, ensure that a rules-based, people-
           oriented, people-centred AseAn community can be realised and is
           ultimately directed to improve living standards for the peoples of AseAn.

           within the region, AseAn remains committed to delivering a humanitarian
           solution to the situation in the rakhine state, myanmar. cognizant of the
           importance of raising AseAn awareness and fostering an AseAn identity, the
           inaugural “AseAn Prize”-administered by Asec-was bestowed upon at the
           33rd AseAn summit in singapore, to encourage an outstanding individual
           or organisation in making inspiring contributions toward the building of an
           AseAn community.

Amid these feats, it is critical to note that challenges faced by the region will
continue to evolve, which would require AseAn member states to strengthen
and widen their level of cooperation. The theme of “Advancing Partnership
for sustainability”-chosen by Thailand for its chairmanship in 2019-echoes
this sentiment. only through inclusive and collaborative engagement can the
AseAn community be truly bolstered to substantially transform the lives of
the over-640 million people in AseAn.

    dvancing Partnership for sustainability”, the theme of Thailand’s
    chairmanship for 2019, underscores the importance of sustainability for
AseAn’s Political-security, economic, and socio-cultural pillars.

Along these lines, Thailand will continue to enhance AseAn community
building efforts, making use of the technological advances of the Fourth
industrial revolution (4ir) to improve AseAn’s competitiveness.

Thailand also aims to reinforce an AseAn-centred regional architecture in
relation with its external partners–and to promote connectivity by bolstering
infrastructure, rules and regulations, and people-to-people links.

For the Political-security pillar, Thailand’s priorities are to promote sustainable
regional security, strengthen cooperation on border management, and to
enhance cybersecurity cooperation. This was reflected in the ASEAN Leaders’
vision statement on Advancing Partnership for sustainability that was adopted
by the 34th AseAn summit.

To promote peace and stability, current issues in several places are being
addressed, such as the south china sea and the rakhine state in myanmar.

on the south china sea, negotiations for a code of conduct (coc) progressed
during the 21st AseAn-china summit in november 2018, which commemorated
the 15th Anniversary of the ASEAN-China Strategic Partnership. A first reading
of the single draft negotiating Text is expected in 2019.

with forecasted growth of 4.9% for 2019, according to the Asian development
Bank. Preliminary AseAn statistics also indicate that total merchandise trade
in 2018 grew by an estimated 8.1% year-on-year (yoy) to reach us$2.8 trillion,
while foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows increased by 5.3% YOY to reach
us$154.7 billion.

nevertheless, the region’s growth outlook is overcast by continued uncertainties
surrounding trade tensions between major trading partners, as well as pressure
on the multilateral trading system, technological disruptions, and concerns
over debt sustainability. despite these challenges, the implementation of the
AseAn economic community (Aec) remains on track.

regional efforts have been spearheaded by the economic deliverables associated
with the AseAn chairmanship’s themes of “resilient and innovative” in 2018
and “Advancing Partnership for sustainability” in 2019. consistent with these
themes, AseAn has embarked on initiatives to better prepare the community
for digital transformation and to ensure sustained economic growth.

key achievements in 2018 include the adoption of the AseAn digital integration
Framework, endorsement of the AseAn Framework on digital data governance,
and the signing of the AseAn Agreement on electronic commerce, which
sealed the region’s commitment to deepen cooperation in the era of the digital
economy and e-commerce. more remains to be done in 2019, including follow-

Ensuring that the region is resilient and poised to reap the benefits of the
Fourth industrial revolution (4ir) has been central to AseAn’s agenda.

AseAn has pushed to improve the competitiveness and productivity of youth
by imbuing them with 21st century skills, supporting higher education mobility,
and by enhancing the role of business and industry in modernising technical
and vocational education and training (TveT) systems.

A regional working group of business and industry representatives was
established and is developing recommendations to bolster contributions to
TveT in AseAn.

The european union support to higher education in the AseAn region (eu
shAre) supported the intra-regional mobility of nearly 500 AseAn students
through scholarships.

A   seAn day, observed annually on 8 August, traditionally offers a chance
    to celebrate solidarity, unity, and cross-border integration–as well as to
deepen awareness of AseAn and to develop a sense of identity and belonging.

in 2018, AseAn’s 51st anniversary was observed in each AseAn member
State (AMS) and across every sector. It was an opportunity to reflect on the
achievements AseAn has made in bettering the lives of its citizens.

At the AseAn secretariat (Asec), a series of community and youth engagement
events were held involving more than 500 guests, including members of the
diplomatic corps, civil society, international organisations, and other entities
associated with AseAn.

Celebrations featured the official launch of empowering Youths Across ASEAN,
a partnership programme between the Maybank and ASEAN Foundations. The
programme provided AseAn youths with a capacity-building workshop and
a chance to create impactful initiatives for the communities that they were
selected to serve.

Another highlight of AseAn day was the launch of the AseAn Artists residency
Programme in support of the arts community across Ams. The residency
underscores a commitment to promote AseAn identity and to deepen mutual
understanding of the diverse cultures in the region.




          ASEAN works to ensure a better life for the present and future generations.
