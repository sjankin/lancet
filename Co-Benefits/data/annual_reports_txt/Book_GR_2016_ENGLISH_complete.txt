OVERVIEW

UNHCR IN 2016
Mission
The High Commissioner for Refugees is mandated by
the United Nations to lead and coordinate
international action for the worldwide protection of
refugees and the resolution of refugee problems.
To date (December 2016), 148 States are parties to the
1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees
and/or to its 1967 Protocol.
UNHCR’s primary purpose is to safeguard the rights
and well-being of refugees. In its efforts to achieve this
objective, the Office strives to ensure that everyone
can exercise the right to seek asylum and find safe
refuge in another State, and to return home voluntarily.
By assisting refugees to return to their own country or
to settle permanently in another country, UNHCR also
seeks lasting solutions to their plight.
UNHCR’s Executive Committee (98 member States as
of end-2016) and the UN General Assembly have
authorized involvement with other groups. These
include former refugees who have returned to their
homeland; internally displaced people; and people

who are stateless or whose nationality is disputed.
To date (December 2016), 89 States are parties to the
1954 Convention relating to the Status of Stateless
Persons and 68 to the 1961 Convention on the
Reduction of Statelessness.
The Office seeks to reduce situations of forced
displacement by encouraging States and other
institutions to create conditions which are conducive
to the protection of human rights and the peaceful
resolution of disputes. In all of its activities, it pays
particular attention to the needs of children and seeks
to promote the equal rights of women and girls.
The Office carries out its work in collaboration with
many partners, including governments, regional,
international and non-governmental organizations. It is
committed to the principle of participation, believing
that refugees and others who benefit from the
organization’s activities should be consulted over
decisions which affect their lives.

Violent conflict and persecution, compounded
by rising food insecurity, environmental
degradation, poor governance and countless
other factors, drove more than three million
people to leave their countries as refugees or
to seek asylum in 2016, joining millions of
others already in exile. Many more people
were trapped or uprooted inside their own
countries. Political solutions and prospects for
peace remained elusive in most situations,

global number of people of concern to

A watershed moment for the refugee cause by High Commissioner Filippo Grandi

The majority of the world’s refugees found
safety in neighbouring countries, many of
which have a tradition of providing refuge
despite pressing development challenges.
These countries opened their doors to
people fleeing conflict and persecution,
showing compassion, generosity and a
commitment to the principles of
international protection. At the same time,
hospitality waned in some regions and a
growing sentiment of “enough is enough”
found expression in restrictions on access
to protection and pressure to return in
conditions that were less than voluntary.
Meanwhile, life got harder for many already
in exile. Faced with protection risks and
uncertainty in countries of asylum, hundreds
of thousands of refugees felt compelled to
undertake dangerous journeys over land
and sea, alongside migrants, risking their
lives for a more secure future.
Many—including a growing number of
children on the move—faced exploitation
and violence at the hands of traffickers and
smugglers, crossing the Sahara and North
Africa, on the Andaman or Mediterranean
seas, and in the Northern Triangle of
Central America. In the Mediterranean
alone, more than 5,000 lost their lives, a
third more than the number of those who
perished in 2015.
The large-scale arrival of refugees and
migrants in Europe in 2015 brought their
plight into public consciousness, and this

8

•

UNHCR GLOBAL REPORT 2016

issue remained prominent in 2016. On one
level, this galvanized new opportunities to
mobilize support. There were remarkable
expressions of solidarity at the local level.
People opened their homes to refugees
and shared with them what they had.
Thousands of volunteers came together to
receive and support refugees arriving in
their cities and communities, including
through resettlement and humanitarian
admission programmes. And internationally,
the participation of the first-ever Refugee
Team in the Olympics helped draw attention
to the extraordinary courage, strength and
resilience of refugees.
But despite the encouraging actions of so
many, there was a simultaneous
politicization of the refugee issue.
Sometimes this was deliberately fuelled by
nationalistic tendencies and xenophobia,
but it was also shaped by a prevailing
environment of economic uncertainty, and
by the insecurity generated by terrorist
incidents across many regions. This
underscored the importance of countering
a dangerous blurring of the lines between
those fleeing violence, repression and
extremism, and those causing it, and of
working to forge a greater appreciation for
the life-saving act of asylum.

Refugee Response Framework (CRRF)
whenever there is a large movement of
refugees and in response to protracted
refugee crises. The aim is to engineer a
shift beyond existing humanitarian models
to a comprehensive, people-centred
refugee response; to engage a broader
alliance of actors and develop innovative
approaches, including support to host
countries and communities; to ensure fair,
efficient and humane systems for receiving
and registering refugees; to promote
self-reliance; and to inject an early focus on
solutions. These elements will form the
basis of a Global Refugee Compact, to be
elaborated and presented for adoption by
UN Member States in 2018.
Throughout the year, five key orientations
emerged as central elements of UNHCR’s
work in today’s global context. These
feature prominently in the Strategic
Directions that we developed in the course
of 2016, and which will shape our work over
the next five years.

Ensuring protection
remains at the heart of the
international refugee
response
Throughout 2016 we continued to support
States to uphold their protection
responsibilities, working with governments
and partners to forge protection strategies
for refugees and IDPs. Our approach
remains to strengthen protection across the
entire spectrum of displacement,

10

•

UNHCR GLOBAL REPORT 2016

recognizing that enhancing the protection
of the internally displaced and working to
resolve their plight is an important
stabilizing factor. Central to UNHCR’s
protection work—echoed in the Strategic
Directions and in the New York
Declaration—is to apply a community-based
approach fostering the participation of
refugees and IDPs in decisions affecting
their lives.
Regional and cross-regional approaches
addressing protection challenges in
countries of origin, transit and beyond
remained critical, and the year saw a
number of regional processes which helped
strengthen protection for the displaced.
One such was the San José Action
Statement, addressing the growing
phenomenon of mixed movements,
including the forced displacement of those
fleeing violence by criminal groups in the
Northern Triangle of Central America.
Another was the Abuja Action Statement,
which reaffirmed the principle of
non-refoulement and committed
governments in the Lake Chad Basin to
strengthening protection in the region.

Responding to
emergencies
By the end of the year, six UNHCR
emergency declarations were in place,
covering more than 20 countries affected
by large-scale internal displacement or
refugee influxes. We continued to adapt
and reinforce our emergency capacities,

-----------------------Page 12 End-----------------------

A watershed moment for the refugee cause by High Commissioner Filippo Grandi

including through important investments in
emergency preparedness, new systems for
early warning and monitoring displacement
risks, and assessing and boosting our
readiness and response capacities in the
field. More than 370 emergency missions
and deployments were undertaken;
emergency teams helped, for example, in
establishing major new settlements in
Uganda and in ramping up operations
elsewhere.

Fostering inclusion through
support to host countries
and communities
The consequences of forced displacement
fall disproportionately on the countries and
communities neighbouring conflict zones
that receive refugees and provide them
with protection and assistance. UNHCR has
for some time sought to foster approaches
connecting refugees and stateless people
to national systems and economies.
The year saw an emerging
recognition—reflected in the New York
Declaration and a number of other
important developments—that new
approaches are needed to support host
countries, recognizing that they cannot do it
alone, especially in protracted situations.
Development resources and investments
targeting both refugees and host
communities, including attention to
livelihoods and increasing educational
opportunities, are critical and can lead to
better protection outcomes for those we
care for.

Foreword

OVERVIEW

The growing involvement in 2016 of the
World Bank, as well as regional financial
institutions, in refugee situations was
therefore an immensely important
development. Grants, concessional
financing arrangements and other
development instruments linked to the
presence of refugees provide an important
boost to the national development of host
countries. They can also have multiple
benefits for refugees. Equipping them with
skills and resources—especially women and
young people—empowers refugees to
contribute to the reconstruction of their
countries and to the building of peace when
return is viable. Our use of cash-based
interventions, an important means of
fostering dignity and economic inclusion,
expanded significantly to $688 million, up
from $325 million in 2015. UNDP and
UNHCR are also working closely on
synergies between humanitarian and
development programmes supporting
refugee and host communities alike,
including in our regional response to the
Syrian refugee crisis.

Pursuing solutions
With the root causes of conflict
unaddressed, a growing number of people
are left without access to durable solutions.
I firmly believe it is time to redirect
international attention to this compelling
priority through strong advocacy for political
solutions, and by drawing the world’s
attention to the humanitarian consequences
of conflict. I was encouraged by how,

2016 UNHCR GLOBAL REPORT

OVERVIEW

Foreword

A watershed moment for the refugee cause by High Commissioner Filippo Grandi

despite relatively low voluntary repatriation
numbers overall in 2016, shifts in the
political landscape and government policies
in countries including Colombia, Côte
d'Ivoire and Sri Lanka created evolving
openings for potential solutions.
Even in complex situations, where peace
has not been definitively restored,
investments in reconstruction and
development, measures to enhance
security and restore the rule of law, and
targeted support for reintegration can open
up possibilities for solutions for some.
Nonetheless, 2016 also brought challenges
in certain regions where political dynamics
translated into pressures for return in less
than voluntary circumstances, challenges
which call for carefully calibrated advocacy
and engagement with States in line with
UNHCR’s protection mandate.
We must be alert to opportunities in
countries where shifts in the dynamics of
conflict may open up space to strengthen
protection in some areas and facilitate
humanitarian access. We are seeing
something of this in the Lake Chad region,
for example. In places like Iraq and Syria,
we must be ready to support spontaneous
returns, reorienting our operations should
political and security developments create
space for safe, dignified and sustainable
voluntary repatriation in the future.
Efforts to pursue and expand resettlement
and other complementary pathways for
admission to third countries must continue,
despite recent setbacks. The high-level

12

•

UNHCR GLOBAL REPORT 2016

meeting organized by UNHCR on 30 March
2016 on global responsibility-sharing
through pathways for admission of Syrian
refugees was an important step forward.
Important progress was also made in 2016
in preventing and reducing statelessness,
including through welcome changes in law,
policy, and other measures by States
including Côte d’Ivoire, Indonesia, Kenya
and Thailand.

Enhancing and expanding
partnerships
No review of 2016 would be complete
without mention of the central role of
UNHCR’s partners—host and donor
countries, NGOs, UN agencies,
development actors and the private
sector—in helping the organization deliver
on its mandate.
Partnerships with NGOs remained a key
pillar of our response. In 2016, UNHCR
disbursed $1.4 billion to more than
830 partners, including nearly $1.1 billion to
673 national or international NGOs. In line
with our commitments under the Grand
Bargain, adopted as part of the World
Humanitarian Summit in May 2016, some
$614 million was provided to local partners,
including $432 million to national NGOs.
Last year also provided an impetus to the
development of non-traditional
partnerships, including with development
actors, the private sector and civil society,

-----------------------Page 14 End-----------------------

and this is a prominent feature of the CRRF.
New agreements with the OECD and ILO
were reached, aimed at facilitating refugee
access to decent work and livelihoods. Our
partnership with IOM was enhanced
through its closer association with the UN
system.
I remain extremely grateful for our donors’
steadfast support and continued trust in the
organization. Last year was a record one for
financial contributions to UNHCR, with
$3.9 billion in funding received, and yet,
growing needs meant some 41 per cent of
UNHCR’s budget was unmet. WFP, one of
our most critical partners, also faced gaps in
funding, which had a severe impact on the
food security, health and nutritional status
of refugees, especially in Africa.

Making it work
Building on the conclusions of our Global
Representatives Meeting in early 2016, a
number of measures for enhancing our
flexibility and capacity for field delivery
were either initiated or reinforced in 2016.
These included the launch of a
Headquarters review, taking stock of where
and how we need to reorient our operations
in Geneva, Budapest and Copenhagen;
steps to reinforce and bring more
coherence to oversight arrangements; and
important strides in the management of our
global workforce, with particular attention to
gender, diversity and inclusion.

OVERVIEW

Working directly in conflict-affected
countries requires investments in security
management, with many colleagues
working in unsafe and complex operational
environments. Tragically, two colleagues
lost their lives in Somalia, and three
endured 23 days in captivity in Sudan.
Colleagues also faced serious security
incidents in Afghanistan, Central African
Republic, Nigeria, South Sudan, Syria and
Yemen.

Moving forward
Addressing forced displacement and
statelessness in today’s complex and
dynamic environment requires agile
responses, flexible funding support, and a
renewed push for solutions. Building on the
momentum of the New York Declaration,
and drawing lessons from the application of
the CRRF, the adoption and implementation
of the Global Compact on Refugees must
be a crucial shared priority in the years
ahead.
Despite the challenges, I believe it is
possible to generate positive dynamism
around the refugee issue and to leverage
greater support for those affected by
conflict, persecution and statelessness. This
is a watershed moment for the refugee
cause, and an opportunity to take collective
action to address forced displacement.
UNHCR stands ready, with your support, to
achieve these goals.

Special Envoy
“We are at an exceptionally difficult moment internationally,
when the consequences of the refugee crisis seem to be
outstripping our will and capacity and even our courage to
respond to it.”
— Special Envoy ANGELINA JOLIE addressing journalists in the Bekaa Valley, Lebanon.

Angelina Jolie started out as UNHCR’s
goodwill ambassador in 2001 and, following
more than a decade of hard work, she was
elevated to a rather exceptional role in 2012
when she was named Special Envoy of the
UN High Commissioner for Refugees. The
rich experience she has accumulated over
the years has enabled her to speak with
authority and insight, to be an eloquent
spokesperson for UNHCR and, more
importantly, for refugees. Her expertise is a
result of her direct engagement, her
compassion, and the knowledge she has
acquired from traveling the globe on behalf
of UNHCR and which has seen her conduct
nearly 60 missions to the field.
In 2016, the Special Envoy continued
focusing her advocacy work on the Syria
situation, visiting Greece and Lebanon in
March to mark the fifth anniversary of the

14

•

UNHCR GLOBAL REPORT 2016

start of the conflict. While addressing
journalists from the Bekaa Valley she called
upon governments to find diplomatic
solutions to the crisis and to look at what
more they themselves can do to provide
safety to those fleeing persecution and war.
The Special Envoy said, “We are at an
exceptionally difficult moment
internationally, when the consequences of
the refugee crisis seem to be outstripping
our will and capacity and even our courage
to respond to it.” Later in the year she
passed another strong message while in
Jordan, appealing to world leaders to “ask
the fundamental question of what are the
root causes of the Syria conflict, and what
will it take to end it.” She urged the
international community to do more to solve
the country’s crisis, noting that “the gulf
between our responsibilities and our
actions has never been so wide.”

The Special Envoy also took her advocacy
for refugees to some of the world’s capitals.
Illustrative of the impact and access she
affords refugees and the work UNHCR does
with and for them, in London she delivered
a keynote address as part of the BBC's
World on the Move day of coverage of
global migration issues. Warning of the risks
of a break down in the international
humanitarian system for refugees, she also
cautioned against a “fear of migration” and
a “race to the bottom” as countries
compete to protect themselves. In
Washington DC in June, the Special Envoy
marked World Refugee Day together with
US Secretary of State, John Kerry. At a joint

press conference, the Special Envoy
thanked Americans for the work so many
do on behalf of refugees in the US and
around the world. She also stated that,
“The answer to addressing the global
refugee crisis surely lies in finding common
purpose and drawing strength from each
other. In staying true to who we are, and
showing that we have the fight in us to
confront our generation’s test and emerge
stronger for it.” The two also took part in an
interfaith Iftar reception bringing together
refugee families, social service
organizations, interfaith leaders and
members of a number of American religious
communities.

1,000 families.
After almost one year of conflict in Yemen, more than 2.4 million people
are forcibly displaced by the fighting, many in hard-to-reach areas.

By the end of April, almost 260,000 Burundians have fled to nearby countries,
many reporting human rights abuses in Burundi.
But underfunding means UNHCR is struggling to provide even basic assistance
such as shelter, household items. Specialized services—counselling, care for the

There are now nearly 5 million Syrian refugees in neighbouring
countries, hundreds of thousands more in Europe, and
6.3 million people displaced inside Syria itself.
UNHCR is coordinating the Syrian refugee response through the 3RP,
bringing together more than 240 partners to assist almost
5 million Syrian refugees and more than 4.4 million people in the
communities hosting them.

Global Strategic Priorities

Global Strategic
ACHIEVEMENTS

UNHCR’s Global Strategic Priorities (GSPs) provide
important direction for operations to target interventions
across a range of core areas where the Office seeks to
improve protection, and find solutions, for refugees and
other people of concern.

Focused efforts on core GSP areas yielded positive
results in 2016, with many operations reporting
improvements in the situation of people of concern in a
number of priority areas.

The GSPs are divided into two categories: ‘operational’
for field operations, and ‘support and management’ for
core corporate functions. Operational GSPs guide the
development of annual operations plans and inform
strategic discussions on prioritization at the field level.
Throughout the year, UNHCR closely monitors progress
achieved against the GSPs and takes corrective actions,
where required. Support and management GSPs
underpin UNHCR’s organizational commitment to
strengthen its response, and improve its efficiency and
effectiveness, across a vast range of functional areas.

Sustained advocacy efforts and technical support led to
positive changes in legislation and policies which
directly impact the lives of refugees, stateless people,
IDPs and returnees. As an example, access to legal aid
for people displaced by the conflict was passed into law
in Ukraine. A number of States also took important
steps to grant nationality to stateless people, resulting
in some 60,800 stateless individuals or those with
undetermined nationality acquiring or having their
nationality confirmed in 2016.

Global Strategic Priorities 

|

OVERVIEW

Priorities 2016-2017
Operations continued to strengthen registration
processes and quality data collection, including
biometrics. UNHCR and partners also continued to raise
awareness of the importance of birth registration as
critical to securing the rights of children.

With the mass arrival of refugees in emergency
situations putting significant burden on existing water
systems, UNHCR and partners were able to secure
life-saving water supplies, and progressively improve
supply as the situations stabilized.

UNHCR worked together with partners and
governments to prevent and respond to sexual and
gender-based violence (SGBV). In Rwanda, UNHCR
supported the Government to provide survivors with
access to services, including health care, counselling
and legal advice, at dedicated centres. In the United
Republic of Tanzania, medical staff provided health and
protection screening at border entry points to identify
survivors of SGBV as quickly as possible and accelerate
the speed of referrals to health services and
psychosocial counselling.

UNHCR continued advocating for and supporting the
inclusion of refugee children into national education
systems as the most sustainable approach for
ensuring continuous education. Community support
projects were implemented to address the shared
needs of local host communities and displaced
people, nurturing mutual understanding and
relationships. These projects enhanced social
cohesion and increased a shared sense of ownership
and leadership among refugees and local host
communities.

Global Strategic Priorities

CHALLENGES

The participation of women in decision-making
leadership and management structures was supported,
including setting up community-based protection
networks to promote community participation and
mobilization.

Difficulty in achieving progress in some priority areas
was most often linked to the challenge of
accommodating a comprehensive response with finite
budgetary resources, and the need to prioritize certain
interventions over others. With regard to nutrition, for
example, programming priorities focused on acute
malnutrition and immediate lifesaving activities over
those aimed at preventing malnutrition. Food security
was also put at risk due to interruptions or reductions in
the pipeline. For example, some 2.2 million refugees in
nine countries had cuts in their food assistance, ranging
from 14 per cent in Ethiopia to 75 per cent for some
refugee groups in Uganda.

Operations focused on the economic inclusion of
refugees by incorporating them into existing
development and poverty alleviation programmes. By
making a safe and sustainable living, they can become
self-reliant and lead active and productive lives.
UNHCR’s capacity to facilitate resettlement of
vulnerable refugees was significantly strengthened in
2016. More than 162,000 cases were submitted for
resettlement, a 21 per cent increase compared to 2015,
and some 125,600 refugees departed to a resettlement
country, a 53 per cent increase compared to the
previous year.

OVERVIEW

for water provision was particularly challenging where
rapid increases in the number of refugees overwhelmed
existing water supply systems.

To address those challenges, UNHCR strengthened
partnerships and continued to advocate with States for the
removal of obstacles to economic inclusion.

Ensuring access to assistance and basic services was
also challenging because of the increasing number of
people of concern on the move, or living in urban areas.
In particular, identifying survivors of SGBV and ensuring
proper support case management for survivors among
populations on the move was very difficult.

FOR MORE INFORMATION

For some GSP areas, progress is dependent on reaching
understanding with key counterparts on how refugees and
other people of concern could be included and prioritized
within overall national priorities and available resources.
As an example, refugees in many countries still faced
difficulties in accessing labour markets, either due to
existing legal frameworks or practical obstacles, such as
high unemployment or lack of requisite language skills.

A summary of progress made against UNHCR’s GSPs in
2016 is presented below. Additional examples are
highlighted throughout this publication. Detailed
reporting on UNHCR’s achievements and challenges
across all GSP areas in 2016 is available in the progress
report, which is available on the Global Focus website
at http://reporting.unhcr.org/thematic.
The report sets out the progress achieved against each
of the GSPs, includes additional highlights from field
operations, and information on global and regional
initiatives that further reinforced and complemented the
actions taken.

OVERVIEW

UNHCR’s Programmes
Introduction
This chapter presents an overview of
UNHCR’s requirements, income and
expenditure in 2016. More detailed
information can be found on UNHCR’s main
operational reporting platform, Global
Focus (http://reporting.unhcr.org).
2016 was a record-breaking year in financial
terms for UNHCR (Chart 1). It saw the office
end the year with its highest budget, of
$7.510 billion, up from $6.546 billion at the
beginning of the year. The $963 million net
increase to its approved budget came
mainly as a result of supplementary appeals
for UNHCR’s work to protect people of
concern and mitigate the effects of conflict
or displacement.
2016 was also a record-breaking year for
support. UNHCR received its highest ever
level of voluntary contributions at
$3.902 billion as 145 governmental and
private donors, a range of pooled funding

mechanisms, as well as income from the UN
Regular Budget, supported the Office’s
work. This included $563 million in
unearmarked funding, and $352 million in
funding from the private sector. Taking into
account the carryover and other income
and adjustments, UNHCR had funds
available to it in 2016 of $4.411 billion.
UNHCR spent $3.967 billion in 2016, its
highest level of expenditure, an increase of
$673 million from that achieved in 2015.
86 per cent of its expenditure was in the
field on operations.
Lastly, the year saw a slight diminution in
the funding gap between what was
requested based on needs and what was
received. The percentage of UNHCR’s
budgeted activities that went unfunded was
41 per cent, or $3.099 billion. This was a
drop on the 48.7 per cent from 2015, at
$3.525 billion.

Budget overview

•

The final annual budget for 2016 amounted
to $7.510 billion, an increase of $963.4 million
compared to the original annual budget of
$6.546 billion approved by the Executive
Committee at its 66th session in October
2015, and $325.0 million more than the
revised annual budget of $7.184 billion
approved by the Executive Committee at its
67th session in October 2016. The greatest
increases occurred in Pillar 1, which was
increased 20 per cent from $4.511 billion to
$5.456 billion due mainly to needs in Africa
and Europe; and regionally, in Europe, which
saw its budget increased nearly 70 per cent
from $516.9 million to $877.9 million given
the refugee and migrant crisis.

majority of UNHCR’s budget—$6.772 billion
or 95 per cent—was for programmes in
Pillar 1 (Refugees) or Pillar 4 (IDPs).

UNHCR’s focus remained on responding to
multiple, large-scale refugee operations,
while continuing to ensure its deep
involvement in IDP projects as well as
continued investment in reintegration and
efforts to eradicate statelessness. The final
annual budget of $7.510 billion comprised
programmed activities of $7.092 billion
(including provisions for administrative costs
at Headquarters, which are covered in part
by the United Nations Regular Budget
contribution); an operational reserve of
$385.7 million; the “new or additional
activities – mandate related” reserve of
$20 million; and $12 million for Junior
Professional Officers (JPOs).

The second highest concentration of budgetary
requirements was in Pillar 4, with $1.315 billion
or 19 per cent of programmed activities. The
greatest regional needs were in the Middle East
and North Africa, with $813.6 million in
requirements or 62 per cent, evidence of the
scale of needs and pattern of displacement
triggered by the conflicts in that region.

Of those two Pillars, the greater part was
concentrated in Pillar 1, with $5.456 billion
or 77 per cent of programmed activities. Of
those Pillar 1 requirements, $2.181 billion or
40%, was in Africa, testament to the
continuing majority of refugees worldwide
being hosted in countries on that continent.
Requirements for Pillar 2 (Stateless)
remained fairly stable at $57.9 million or
approximately 1 per cent of programmed
activities. Pillar 3 (Reintegration) represented
$262 million or 4 per cent.

There was also a $43.4 million reduction in
requirements, which included a $38.4 million
reduction in the Africa region due to a
revision of the population figures in Chad,
and a $5 million reduction in the Middle East
and North Africa region from an alignment
with the Regional Refugee and Resilience
Plan in response to the Syria crisis.

Within the budget for programmed activities,
the total field budget came to $6.445 billion, or
91 per cent. Of UNHCR’s regions, the financial
requirements for two of them—Africa and the
Middle East and North Africa—accounted for
$4.757 billion or 67 per cent of programmed
activities. The budget for Africa at $2.671 billion,
or 38 per cent of programmed activities, was
the largest of the regional budgets. It was
closely followed by that of the Middle East and
North Africa at $2.085 billion, or 29 per cent of
programmed activities. The budget for global
programmes and Headquarters, providing
critical operational and policy support to
operations worldwide, was $646.5 million, or
9 per cent of all programmed activities.

Programmed activities made up 94 per cent
of the 2016 budget, reaching $7.092 billion.
Compared to 2015, this was a slight increase
of $328.1 million, or 5 per cent and, compared
to 2015, requirements for all Pillars were
slightly up. Of programmed activities, the

Compared to budgets in 2015, the overall
trend was an increase in pillar and regional
budgets, but there was significant fluctuation
within that trend. Whereas the budgets for
Pillars 1 and 3 increased 7 and 8 per cent
respectively, budgets for Pillars 2 and 4

reduced 23 per cent and 7 per cent.
Regionally, compared to 2015, the budgets
for Africa and the Middle East and North
Africa decreased 4 per cent and 2 per cent
respectively. The growth compared to 2015
came in Europe, which increased 48 per cent
as a result of requirements to manage the
Europe refugee response; in the Americas,
which increased 19 per cent as a result of the

complex situation that emerged in the
Northern Triangle of Central America; and in
Asia and the Pacific, which saw a 12 per cent
increase in order to support the voluntary
repatriation of Afghans.
For more details on all these operations,
please see the respective regional
summaries.

Supplementary appeals
Responding to new or unforeseen
requirements throughout the year saw
UNHCR issue nine supplementary appeals.
Four of these were for situations in Africa,
one each in the Americas, Asia and the

Europe regions, and one for resettlement.
The financial requirements for these appeals
came to just over $1 billion, and constituted

Quantity

Quality

Not including the transfer from the
UN Regular Budget, UNHCR received
$3.902 billion in voluntary contributions
pledged and received in 2016. Compared to
the $3.361 billion in voluntary contributions
received in 2015, this was an increase of
$541 million or 16 per cent. Including
$411.9 million carried over from 2015,
$41.0 million from the United Nations Regular
Budget, and $55.6 million (excluding the
Working Capital Fund provision of
$50 million) in other income and
adjustments, this meant total funds available
were $4.411 billion. When compared to the
overall level of funds available in 2015 of
$3.706 billion, funds in 2016 increased by
approximately $705 million, or 19 per cent.

Only 14 per cent of UNHCR’s voluntary
contributions were unrestricted, or
unearmarked, the most valuable type of
funding allowing the Office to spend it as
and where it was most needed (Chart 3;
see as well section on unearmarked
funding below). The remainder had varying
levels of earmarking attached to it, with the
largest percentage—65 per cent—being
what is referred to as tightly earmarked to a
country or other location, or to a sector.
More broadly earmarked funding, to the
regional, subregional, situational or
thematic level, constituted the remaining
20 per cent.

OVERVIEW

|

Funding UNHCR’s Programmes

Compared to 2012, the trend is one of a
gradual decline in the percentages of both
unearmarked and broadly earmarked
funding. At the same time, earmarked
funding has increased at the country level
while declining at the sector level. Although
unearmarked or broadly earmarked remains
the most valuable type of funding, the rise
in the amount of earmarking going to the
country or operational level and away from
the sectoral level is a positive trend for
which UNHCR was grateful.

Timeliness and predictability
With the timing of receipt of income having
a significant impact on when the Office can
spend or allocate, 80 per cent of UNHCR’s
income arrived in the first half of the year,
and 46 per cent in the first quarter. The third
quarter saw UNHCR reach 89 per cent of its
income for 2016. This rate of receipt of
income was broadly comparable to
previous years. Insofar as the earlier in the
year income is received the better, this is a
trend that UNHCR was grateful for. Lastly,
while trends in timing offer strong
predictability in receipt of income, of course
this analysis must be paralleled by an
analysis on income against the budget.
Thus, for example, whilst UNHCR received
80 per cent of income in the first half of the
year, that income was equivalent to only
42 per cent of the budget. Critically, 17 per
cent of the funding received in the first half
of the year was unearmarked (amounting to
73 per cent of all the unearmarked funding
received in 2016). This gave invaluable
flexibility in allowing UNHCR to allocate
funding pending receipt of earmarked or
broadly earmarked funding later in the year.
Regarding the timeliness of receipt of
income, but also a strong indicator of its
quality, some 15 per cent of UNHCR’s
contributions in 2016 were part of multi-year
contributions, covering more than
12 months. The percentage of contributions
that exceeded 12 months implementation is

increasing, which is a positive sign and a
good source of predictability in UNHCR’s
income.

Diversity
Overall, 145 separate donors—governments,
private sector sources in Member States,
intergovernmental mechanisms, and pooled
funds—contributed financially to UNHCR in
2016, with a spread of income that remained
relatively stable compared to previous years.
Over half—57 per cent—came from the top
three donors, and the top 10 overall provided
80 per cent, including governmental income
and income from private sector sources within
those States.
Within that top 10, which contributed
$3.289 billion, 93 per cent or $3.063 billion,
was from governments. The remaining
7 per cent, or $225.6 million, was from the
private sector. That sum accounted for
64 per cent of private sector income in
2016, and for income streams coming from
five of the six National Partners.
Most of UNHCR’s income came from
governmental donors, which provided
87 per cent, up from 82 per cent in 2015
(Chart 3). Governmental income increased
from $2.982 billion in 2015 to $3.444 billion
in 2016.
The second largest group of donors was
the private sector, providing 9 per cent,
slightly up on 2015’s level of 8 per cent.
Private sector income increased from
$283.8 million to, in 2016, over
$351.7 million (Chart 3) from four sources:
individual giving; foundations; corporate;
and private philanthropy or leadership
giving. Of these, individual giving was the
largest portion of private sector income,
totalling $227.7 million or 63 per cent.
The six National Partners played a
significant role in securing income from the
private sector. They raised 51 per cent of all

private sector income, including 68 per cent
of the income raised from individual donors,
as well as 21 per cent of income raised from
private philanthropy. The private sector also
was able to further diversify sources of
income, increasing individual donors from
1.4 million to 1.6 million thanks as well to, in
large part, the efforts of the National
Partners in engaging the public and civil
society, and in UNHCR’s own investment in
researching the most promising markets
for this type of outreach and then investing
the appropriate time and capacity in them.
(For more details on the work UNHCR
does with the private sector, and
particularly the work done by the National
Partners in raising funds and awareness,
please see the chapter on Supporting
UNHCR's work.)
Pooled fund mechanisms, including the
CERF and other humanitarian countrybased pooled funds, were the third largest
group of donors, contributing 3 per cent,
the same level as in 2015. Whereas UNHCR
secured income of $91.3 million from

34

•

UNHCR GLOBAL REPORT 2016

pooled funds in 2015, it was $146.4 million
in 2016, an increase of 58 per cent. This
income level saw one of the most important
funds, the CERF, become one of UNHCR’s
top 10 donors with $72.7 million contributed.
The success with fundraising from pooled
funds in 2016 was testament to UNHCR’s
commitment to increasing its engagement in
inter-agency processes and with these
important sources of funding, and in
widening understanding of them within the
organization. The Office acknowledges the
support from the funds, and from the donors
that provide resources for them.
A final note on diversity should be paid to
in-kind income, the value of which
increased 31 per cent from 2015. UNHCR
received in-kind assistance to the value of
$35.7 million, with assistance ranging from
core relief items and similar goods
($17 million), to support for premises
($9 million), to the provision of assistance
such as stand-by partners and software
licenses.

OVERVIEW

Focus on unearmarked funding
In these challenging times, UNHCR relies
more than ever on early, predictable and
unrestricted donor support to provide
uninterrupted protection and assistance
for populations of concern. As the gap
between needs and available humanitarian
resources widens ever further, unrestricted
support has become even more crucial in
providing both the flexibility to implement
emergency operations as soon as
possible, and the ability to continue to
address ongoing operations including to
those overlooked or protracted situations
to which donors do not explicitly direct
funds.
Contributed without restrictions on their
use, unearmarked funding allows UNHCR

critical flexibility in how best to reach
refugees and other populations of concern
in the greatest need and at the greatest
risk. All UNHCR offices benefit from the
allocation of these resources, with the
largest share spent on delivering
programmes in the field, and the balance
used to support global programmes,
without which UNHCR would not be able to
deliver on its mandate.
Unearmarked income was allocated
throughout the year in line with identified
priorities and needs. The main recipients of
unearmarked income were the regions,
which received 59 per cent of the funds,
with the largest amount—32 per cent—
being used in the Asia and Pacific region.

Funding UNHCR’s Programmes

UNHCR received $562.6 million in
unearmarked funding in 2016 from
87 donors (Table 4). This was a 9 per cent
increase on the $514.1 million received in
2015, which was a most positive trend, but
which has to be set against the general
decline in the overall percentage of
unearmarked income against total income
received. The top three donors of
unearmarked funding were Sweden with
$94.9 million or 17 per cent of all
unearmarked funding; private donors in
Spain with $58 million or 10 per cent, all of
which was channelled through the National
Partner, España con ACNUR; and the

36

•

UNHCR GLOBAL REPORT 2016

Netherlands with $46.1 million or
8 per cent. Respectively, this unearmarked
funding accounted for 69 per cent and
78 per cent of Swedish and Dutch
contributions.
Within the top 10 donors of unearmarked
funding there were four private sector
donors, including two of the six National
Partners, and the $172.6 million of
unearmarked income raised from the
private sector accounted for 31 per cent of
all unearmarked funding, and nearly half of
all private sector contributions.

Funding UNHCR’s Programmes

Expenditure overview
Expenditure was $3.967 billion, or 90 per cent
of funds available. The final budget, based on
globally assessed needs, was underfunded
by $3.099 billion, or 41 per cent. When

compared to the $3.294 billion in expenditure
in 2015, expenditure in 2016 increased by
approximately $672.3 million, or
20.4 per cent.

Expenditure by region
Taking the Middle East and North Africa and
Africa together, these two regions
accounted for almost two-thirds of
expenditure on programmed activities. The
highest level was incurred in the the Middle
East and North Africa region, with 33.1 per
cent, followed by Africa, at 30.1 per cent.
The Europe, Asia and Pacific, and Americas
regions followed on 11.3 per cent, 9.5 per
cent, and 1.8 per cent respectively. Global
programmes at 8.5 per cent and
Headquarters at 5.6 per cent complete the
expenditure on programmed activities.
In dollar terms expenditure increased in all
regions, but in percentage terms over total
expenditure for programmed activities there
were drops in Africa (-3.2%) and in the
Middle East and North Africa (-1.9%), and
increases in Asia and the Pacific (+1.7%) and
Europe (+3.9%). Additionally, there was a
drop in the ratio between Headquarters
over total expenditure for programmed
activities from 6.5% to 5.6% (-0.9%).
Within each region, the subregions with the
highest rates of expenditure were Middle East
at 93 per cent of the Middle East and North
Africa’s expenditure; East and Horn of Africa
with 61 per cent of Africa’s expenditure;
South-West Asia with 77 per cent of Asia and
Pacific’s expenditure; Northern, Western,
Central and Southern Europe with 53 per cent
of Europe’s expenditure; and Latin America

38

UNHCR GLOBAL REPORT 2016

with 83 per cent of expenditure within the
Americas.
For full details, please see the regional
summaries.

Seven per cent programme
support costs
Guided by three key objectives—those of
stable, adequate and transparent funding of
Headquarters costs; equitable programme
support contribution across pillars; and
better aligning UNHCR’s practice with the
policies of the UN System—UNHCR now
applies a 7 per cent programme support
component to all earmarked contributions
received, excluding contributions
earmarked to cover Headquarters costs,
in-kind contributions and JPOs.
This policy was adopted with the intent of
ensuring transparent, equitable and
predictable coverage of Headquarters costs
through a means that more accurately
reflects the distribution of income and
expenditure in UNHCR’s operations across
all four budget pillars. In 2016, this policy
generated $204 million, of which
$165 million was used to fund
Headquarters, $12 million was allocated to
the staff benefits fund, and the balance of
$27.1 million to the field.

Status of UNHCR’s Grand Bargain commitments in 2016
The table below outlines achievements
made under the five work streams against
which UNHCR made specific
commitments at the occasion of the World
Humanitarian Summit (WHS). UNHCR is
also committed to active and
wide-ranging engagement and

participation in work streams for which a
specific commitment was not made.
For more information on its commitments
and its participation, please refer to the
UNHCR Grand Bargain self-reporting at
https://interagencystandingcommittee.
org/grand-bargain-hosted-iasc.

More support and funding tools for local and national responders
UNHCR is committed to transfer at
least 25 per cent of its programme
expenditures to the local and national
responders by 2020.

In 2016, UNHCR transferred 16 per cent of its total expenditure to local
partners (local NGOs and local/national governments combined). While
the percentage increase from 2015 remained at 1 per cent, overall
expenditure increased from $490 million in 2015 to $623 million in 2016.

UNHCR commits to expand its
investment in institutional capacity
building of national partners, and to
support effective emergency
preparedness.

In collaboration with key UN partners, UNHCR simplified and facilitated
partnership arrangements to foster greater collaboration with local and
national responders in humanitarian operations.
UNHCR expanded opportunities for local government authorities and
other national and local partners to participate in emergency trainings and
inter-agency contingency planning workshops, of which 23 took place
during the year.

Increase use and coordination of cash-base programming
UNHCR is committed to doubling the
amount of funds programmed for
cash-based interventions (CBI) by the
end of 2020.

UNHCR transferred $688 million to beneficiaries compared to
$325 million in 2015, fulfilling its WHS commitment to double CBI.

Reduce duplication and management costs with periodic functional
reviews (co-convened with THE Government of Japan)
UNHCR is committed to reduce the
cost of procurement and logistics by 10
per cent by the end of 2020 through
the use of shared services with partner
agencies.

On behalf of the UN Procurement Network, UNHCR recruited a consultant
to analyse collaborative procurement opportunities. Phase 1 of the project
was completed in December 2016 and prioritized procurement items for
greater impact from joint procurement.

UNHCR is also committed to expand
the use of biometrics for refugee
registration to 75 operations by 2020.

UNHCR biometrics coverage has increased to 44 country operations
from 34.

A participation revolution
UNHCR is committed to ensuring equal
(50 per cent) and meaningful
participation of women and adolescent
girls in all decision-making processes
and structures in forced displacement
contexts by 2020.

Out of 65 refugee and IDP situations reporting on the indicator, 48 were
in the acceptable range of 35% female participation or above.

Enhance engagement between humanitarian and development actors

40

•

UNHCR is committed to further
collaboration with Multilateral
Development Banks and, based on joint
research with development partners,
will enhance its evidence base
advocacy on behalf of the population in
protracted situations.

UNHCR collaborated with the World Bank on a ground-breaking study on
forced displacement, launched at the 19 September General Assembly
Summit.
UNHCR and ILO signed a revised memorandum of understanding in July
2016 promoting employment possibilities for populations of concern, and
developing better guidance to support governments in these efforts.

UNHCR is committed to reinforcing the
Solutions Alliance as a central platform
for collaborative actions in support of
solutions to conflict-induced
displacement.

During 2017, the Solutions Alliance will transition itself into existing
initiatives, such as the CRRF, that are also committed to reinforcing
collaborative actions in support of solutions to conflict-induced
displacement.

OVERVIEW

Conclusion
2016 funding was, on the one hand, a
record. On the other, it still left 41 per cent
of the budget unfunded. This meant that,
throughout the year, UNHCR had to face
and handle challenges related to
underfunding and how to prioritize activities
for support, with prioritization defined as a
compromise between what is judged urgent
and essential within the Office’s activities,
and what is possible given available
resources and capacity. While the Office did
prioritize life-saving assistance and core
protection activities, this had severe
impacts on activities such as education,
more durable infrastructure, solutions, cash
programmes and interventions requiring
large investment costs but for which there
is strong evidence of the benefits and
greater cost efficiencies in the long term.
Given the above—that even with 2016’s
record levels of generosity, UNHCR had to
rigorously prioritize—the Office was faced
with funding gaps. These gaps generated
specific and measurable consequences,
some of which are outlined below.
■■UNHCR was unable to assist 1.3 million
people with shelter, including emergency
shelter, and shelter of transitional or longterm type. The largest gaps in shelter
support were in the DRC, Ethiopia, South
Sudan, Turkey, and the United Republic of
Tanzania.
■■The Office was not able to provide cash
assistance to some 2 million people so as
to help them meet their most basic needs.
The largest unmet needs of this type were
in Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, the Syrian Arab
Republic (Syria), Turkey, and Yemen.
■■UNHCR could not assist 5.1 million people
with core relief items. The largest number
of people with such unmet needs were
in Afghanistan, Cameroon, Iraq, South
Sudan, Syria, and Yemen.

■■641,000 women and girls could not be
helped with sanitary materials. The largest
unmet needs were in Cameroon, Chad,
Myanmar, South Sudan, Sudan, Turkey,
and Uganda.
■■UNHCR was not able to assist some
418,000 children to be enrolled in primary
education. This had particular impacts on
populations in Cameroon, Chad, Iraq, Kenya,
Lebanon, Pakistan, South Sudan, Sudan,
Uganda, among others. [NB: This refers to
UNHCR’s planning for 2016 only and not to
the overall number of children out of school,
or capacities of other partners.]
Throughout the year, UNHCR maintained or
intensified efforts to expand its donor base,
and this has generated results. For
example, it saw the continued exponential
increase in private sector fundraising, from
2 per cent of income ($22 million) in 2006
to 9 per cent ($352 million) in 2016; robust
engagement with emerging donors,
including in the Gulf region; and
unprecedented cooperation with the World
Bank and other international financial
institutions. Initiatives with development
actors will be of significant help in reducing
the amount the Office spends on care and
maintenance in protracted situations.
However, even if successful these will likely
not eliminate UNHCR’s reliance on key
State partners who provide the lion’s share
of its funding, and which provide much
more than financial contributions alone.
Such expansion also requires investment in
time, capacity, staffing, and finances.
For the generous support it received in
2016 from governments, from the private
sector—citizens, National Partners,
corporations, and foundations—from
intergovernmental institutions, and from the
many pooled funding mechanisms, UNHCR
offers its most heartfelt thanks.

Working
Environment
Global displacement has grown
year-on-year since 2011. By 2016, the Africa
region was hosting almost 30 per cent of
UNHCR’s total population of concern
worldwide. The total number of displaced
and stateless people in Africa doubled from
10.2 to approximately 20 million during
those five years. At the end of 2016, Africa
generously hosted 5.6 million refugees and
asylum-seekers and almost 13.2 million IDPs
and returnees, and 715,000 stateless people.
Multiple crises across the continent
remained unresolved and further
deteriorated, with more than 2 million
forcibly displaced people in 2016. Of the six
situations worldwide UNHCR considered
emergencies in 2016 (see Responding with
lifesaving support chapter and Glossary),
three were in Africa, namely in Burundi,
Nigeria and South Sudan, which triggered
large-scale displacements. Security
incidents in some parts of Chad, the Central
African Republic (CAR), the Democratic
Republic of the Congo (DRC), Mali, Nigeria,
Somalia and South Sudan also exacerbated
the situation for those already in exile or
displaced within each country, with limited
prospects for return.

Africa

Across the continent, the effects of
protracted conflicts, climate change and
drought fuelled food insecurity, affecting
nearly 20 million people. The number of
refugees affected by cuts to food
assistance, forced by funding shortfalls,
rose sharply, from less than 800,000 in
2014 to close to two million in 2016. In some
cases, food assistance was cut by half in
large operations, including in Cameroon,
Chad, Kenya, South Sudan and Uganda. In
many refugee sites in these countries, acute
malnutrition and anaemia was greater than
40 per cent. This upwards trend is expected
to grow, unless adequate funding is made
available.
Faced with such a range of demands,
needs and risks, UNHCR focused on
providing urgent protection and emergency
response; on further strengthening efforts
in search of sustainable solutions; and on
expanding and deepening partnerships, to
address both recent and more protracted
displacement situations.

Major SITUATIONS
Burundi situation
Since the outbreak of civil conflict in April
2015, some 409,000 Burundian refugees
have fled to the DRC, Rwanda, Uganda and
the United Republic of Tanzania, including
more than 120,000 Burundian refugees in
2016. Approximately 500 to 700 refugees
arrived daily in the United Republic of
Tanzania, where camps exceeded their
capacity by tens of thousands.
In response to growing protection needs,
UNHCR launched a supplementary appeal
for the Burundi situation in July 2016 and
updated the regional Refugee Response

UNHCR GLOBAL REPORT 2016

Plan (RRP). The organization continued to
lead and coordinate the response to the
Burundi refugee emergency in each affected
country, in close collaboration with the
relevant governments. Throughout 2016, it
strengthened border and protection
monitoring activities preventing
non-refoulement. Being as it is one of the
five pilot countries for the Comprehensive
Refugee Response Framework (CRRF – see
Glossary), UNHCR is also working with the
Government of the United Republic of
Tanzania to set up the CRRF Secretariat.

Central African Republic
situation
CAR experienced renewed violence in
2016. In western and central parts of the
country, the situation remained volatile, with
kidnappings and clashes between armed
groups leading to internal population
movements and waves of new arrivals in
neighbouring countries. By the end of the
year, some 460,000 Central African
refugees were in Cameroon, Chad, Congo
and the DRC, and more than 411,000 were
internally displaced. UNHCR continued to
provide support to the CAR Government for
the voluntary return of IDPs to areas
including within the capital, Bangui.

Mali situation
The security situation in northern and
central Mali remained fragile, with a number
of terrorist attacks taking place. Slow
progress in implementing the peace
agreement, which was signed in June 2015,
hindered large-scale returns. Small numbers
of refugees and IDPs returned
spontaneously and received reintegration
support from UNHCR. The Office continued
to provide protection and basic assistance

140,000 Malian

Increasing focus was

OF AFRICA

CENTRAL
AFRICA AND THE
GREAT LAKES

Since the outbreak of the Boko Haram
insurgency in 2009, the security situation in
the Lake Chad Basin region has been one
of extreme challenges for governments,
humanitarians, Nigerian refugees, IDPs and
host communities in Cameroon, Chad and
Niger in 2016. In addition to an estimated
2.7 million IDPs inside Nigeria and more
than 200,000 refugees in neighbouring
countries, the conflict has also pushed
hundreds of thousands of people into
internal displacement; over 192,900 people
in Cameroon’s Far North region; some
82,260 in Chad’s Lake region; and a further
184,230 in Niger’s Diffa region.
Boko Haram has also abused populations
on a wide scale and committed grave
human rights violations, including
systematic acts of sexual and gender-based
violence (SGBV). In June 2016, the
governments of Cameroon, Chad, Niger
and Nigeria reached a common
commitment in the Abuja action statement,
to implement the regional strategic
protection framework for the Lake Chad
Basin situation.

refugees, Sudan (297,168), Kenya (88,391),
the DRC (66,672) and CAR (4,915).

Complicating matters, worsening food
insecurity in the Lake Chad Basin region
affected an estimated eight million people.
The need for adequate shelter and core
relief items remained acute inside Nigeria
and hosting countries. UNHCR and its
partners stepped up efforts to respond at
several levels to these needs. While
partners managed to support refugees in
the livelihoods sector, economic
opportunities in the Lake Chad Basin region
remained severely hampered.

In August 2016, UNHCR and partners
revised their contingency plans to ensure
preparedness, in view of the influx of South
Sudanese refugees to neighbouring
countries. To respond to the most urgent
needs, a supplementary appeal for the
South Sudan situation was launched, as
well as a revised “South Sudan regional
Refugee Response Plan” (RRP). UNHCR and
partners focused on life-saving and lifesustaining assistance for refugees,
including basic services, and addressed the
most immediate needs of new arrivals from
South Sudan in hosting countries, through
border monitoring interventions, registration
and documentation. In South Sudan,
UNHCR, as part of the Humanitarian
Country Team, continued to lead the
protection, CCCM, and shelter/NFIs
clusters, which targeted the most
vulnerable IDPs.

South Sudan situation

East and Horn of Africa

The South Sudanese refugee crisis was the
largest refugee emergency on the continent
in 2016. Some 1.9 million people were
internally displaced within the country and
almost half a million South Sudanese
crossed into neighbouring countries during
the second half of the year. Children made
up 67 per cent of the refugee population
and many of them faced alarming levels of
malnutrition. The refugee outflow from
South Sudan continues unabated, with an
average of 3,000 people having crossed
South Sudan’s borders into neighbouring
countries every day in 2016. Uganda was the
largest host country in sub-Saharan Africa,
hosting close to 630,000 South Sudanese
refugees. It was followed by Ethiopia, which
hosted some 338,800 South Sudanese

Countries in the East and Horn of Africa
hosted nearly 3.2 million refugees mainly
from the DRC, Somalia and South Sudan.
There were also close to 5.6 million IDPs in
Somalia, South Sudan and Sudan. Conflict,
food insecurity and political instability were
the key factors of displacement in the
region, impelling thousands of people to
cross over into the neighbouring countries.

UNHCR GLOBAL REPORT 2016

The Somali refugee situation remained one
of the most protracted in the world, with
nearly one million Somali refugees hosted
in Djibouti, Ethiopia, Kenya, Uganda and
Yemen and with 1.5 million remaining IDPs
within Somalia. In May 2016, the
Government of Kenya announced its
intention to close Dadaab camp, which was

-----------------------Page 56 End-----------------------

Africa

home at the time to more than
340,000 Somali refugees. UNHCR
responded by intensifying efforts to assist
spontaneous and voluntary returns, and find
resettlement opportunities. The camp’s
population reduced by 60,000 people in
2016 through the re-location of non-Somali,
the resettlement of vulnerable refugees,
and the voluntary repatriation of an
estimated 45,000 Somali refugees. The
Kenyan authorities subsequently extended
the deadline for the camp’s closure to the
end of May 2017. Insecurity, political
instability and food shortage in many parts
in Somalia continued to hamper large-scale
voluntary return and ways to find durable
solutions.
The crisis in Yemen also affected the
subregion, with fewer returning Somali and
new Yemeni refugees. UNHCR and IOM
evacuated thousands of Somalis at risk in
Yemen in 2016.

Achievements and
impact
Addressing the protection and
assistance needs of people of
concern
African countries remained a leading
example of asylum provision, by keeping
their borders open and protecting refugees
from forced returns. Half of the world’s top
10 refugee-hosting countries were in Africa.
However, UNHCR remained concerned
about the civilian and humanitarian
character of asylum in some countries. It
strongly encouraged host governments and
partners to implement strategies to maintain
the civilian character of the camps and
separate armed elements from the refugee
population.

|

REGIONAL SUMMARIES

In response to multiple crises and a growing
number of displaced people, UNHCR aimed
to improve service delivery, including
access to quality secondary and tertiary
education, and vocational training and
livelihood opportunities. During the
high-level summit of the United Nations
General Assembly, aimed at addressing
large movements of refugees and migrants,
as well as the Leaders’ Summit on
Refugees, held in the United States in
September 2016, African Governments
made strong commitments in the areas of
education, employment and housing.
They also committed to discussing
alternative and improved mechanisms to
screen populations at borders, in line with
their international obligations, while paying
attention to the safety of citizens. With
UNHCR’s support, in June 2016 the
Government of Nigeria hosted a regional
protection dialogue on the Lake Chad
Basin, in order to address protection
concerns. The dialogue resulted in the
adoption of the Abuja action statement by
the governments of Cameroon, Chad, Niger
and Nigeria, who committed to respecting
the principle of non-refoulement and to
addressing the most pressing protection
needs of affected populations.

Half of the world’s
top 10 refugeehosting countries
were located in the
continent.

In response to increased mixed movements
from West Africa, through Niger and Libya
to Europe, UNHCR strengthened its
collaboration with partners. In line with
UNHCR’s “10-Point plan of action for
refugee protection and mixed migration”
and the New York Declaration for Refugees
and Migrants (see Glossary), the Office
focused on enhancing support for victims of
trafficking. The organization further
strengthened its “Live, learn and play safe”
programme by issuing standard operating
procedures for the referral of victims of
trafficking to asylum procedures in Niger,

and conducted information campaigns on
the risk of such movements. In Sudan, the
Office worked with the Government, IOM
and others partners, to prevent and reduce
human trafficking.
Forty out of the 54 members of the African
Union had signed the African Union
Convention for the Protection and
Assistance of Internally Displaced Persons
in Africa, also known as the Kampala
Convention (see Glossary). Twenty-five of
them had acceded to it in 2016.

Strengthening emergency
preparedness and response
Regional Refugee
Response Plans
were in place for the
situations in
Burundi, CAR,
Nigeria and South
Sudan.

While the Office deactivated two
emergency declarations for CAR and
Uganda (for refugees from the DRC only),
life-saving protection activities, assistance
and emergency response accounted for
nearly 70 per cent of UNHCR’s expenditure
in Africa. In 2016, regional refugee
coordination mechanisms and RRPs were in
place for the situations in Burundi, CAR,
Nigeria, and South Sudan.
UNHCR was also able to strengthen its
engagement with governments, donors,
host communities and the private sector to
raise the quality of life for refugees. The
Office successfully engaged with a number
of private companies in developing
innovative approaches to meet the needs
of people of concern, including in relation
to energy, security and access to
employment opportunities and by using
new technologies.

UNHCR GLOBAL REPORT 2016

Pursuing durable solutions
During the September 2016 summits in New
York, African States made several
commitments towards refugee protection
and solutions. As a result, and in close
coordination with national authorities, UN
Agencies, host communities and private
sector partners, Djibouti, Ethiopia, Somalia,
Uganda and the United Republic of
Tanzania expressed interest in participating
in the CRRF to enhance refugee protection,
contribute to the finding of sustainable
solutions, and facilitate a more equitable
sharing of responsibility for hosting and
supporting refugees.
UNHCR strengthened its collaboration with
non-traditional development actors, such as
the African Development Bank and the
World Bank, to promote development in
refugee-hosting areas. In response to the
Nigeria situation, UNHCR and the World
Bank published a joint assessment in
July 2016 titled “Forced displacement by
the Boko Haram conflict in the Lake Chad
region”, detailing the socio-economic
situation of refugees, IDPs and other
people of concern, and describing
measures to improve their resilience.
UNHCR also actively pursued the roll-out
of its “Alternative to camps” policy across
the region, advocating the benefits
directly with governments. UNHCR
continued to promote the inclusion of
refugees in national policies and
structures such as education, health and
employment.

-----------------------Page 58 End-----------------------

Africa

The Office made important advances in
implementing the “comprehensive solutions
strategies” for longstanding cases, such as
for the Angolan and pre-1998 Rwandan
situations. UNHCR supported the voluntary
repatriation of more than 5,500 Rwandan
refugees from the DRC and more than
20,000 Ivorian refugees, and continued to
facilitate the local integration of those
affected by the cessation clause (see
Glossary) and who do not wish to return.
Despite the fragile security and socioeconomic environments, the Office also
assisted spontaneous and voluntary returns
to Somalia throughout 2016, as well as a
limited number of spontaneous returns to
Burundi, CAR, Mali and Nigeria.
Nearly 45,000 refugees from sub-Saharan
Africa had their applications for
resettlement countries submitted in 2016,
which was a 13 per cent increase from 2015.
The majority of refugees referred for
resettlement were from the DRC, Eritrea
and Somalia as in previous years.

Working towards ending
statelessness
In line with UNHCR’s “Global action plan to
end statelessness” (2014-2024), significant
progress was made to reduce statelessness
in Africa. Under the auspices of the “Abidjan
Declaration on the eradication of
statelessness”, new national action plans on
statelessness were developed in several

|

REGIONAL SUMMARIES

ECOWAS countries. Burkina Faso joined
UNHCR to implement a documentation
project for undocumented nationals living in
Côte d’Ivoire and who were at risk of
becoming stateless. In Kenya, some
1,500 formerly stateless people obtained
Kenyan nationality. Madagascar became the
first State since the launch of UNHCR’s
#IBelong Campaign to reform its nationality
law, allowing Malagasy mothers to pass on
their nationality to their children on an equal
basis as Malagasy fathers.

Constraints
Volatile security environments across the
region impeded humanitarian access and
made it difficult for UNHCR to maintain
protection space, support access to asylum
and secure durable solutions for refugees.
More than 140 aid workers, including
UNHCR staff, were the victims of attacks in
Africa in 2016.
While the number of people displaced in
sub-Saharan Africa continued to grow in
2016, the financial resources available to
UNHCR per capita dropped more than
30 per cent during the past five years.
This led to gaps in services provided, higher
malnutrition and mortality rates, and the
potential for further displacement. Food
insecurity remained a serious concern and
affected more than 75 percent of refugees
in the region. Joint and expanded
advocacy, initiated in 2016, will continue
throughout 2017.

Financial information
The original 2016 budget for the
Africa region amounted to
$2.29 billion. At the end of 2016, the
revised budget for 2016 had been
revised to $2.67 billion. This was
mainly due to additional financial
requirements of $1.4 billion for
Burundi, Nigeria, Somalia and South
Sudan to scale-up emergency and
regional responses for thousands of
newly displaced people in 2016.
The region received a generous level
of earmarked contributions,
amounting to $1.13 billion, including
7 per cent programme support costs.
Despite this generous level of funding,
this still left 43 per cent of the region’s
needs unmet. UNHCR used an
indicative amount of $81.6 million in
unearmarked funding to cover gaps,
equivalent to 26 per cent of all
unearmarked funds used in the field.
Expenditure in the Africa region
increased in 2016, amounting to
$1.19 billion and representing
30 per cent of programmed
activities. The operations with
largest expenditure were Ethiopia
($135.6 million), South Sudan
($126.3) and Uganda ($125.3 million),
responding to needs associated
with the South Sudan situation.

UNHCR GLOBAL REPORT 2016

The region’s funding shortfall
severely affected UNHCR’s capacity
to respond to new and existing
displacements across the continent.
The needs for protection-related
activities were particularly key in the
response to the urgent lack of food
security, as this entailed direct
protection risks, especially for
women and girls. The lack of funding
available made itself particularly felt
in the following areas:
•	 In Rwanda, Uganda and the United
Republic of Tanzania, UNHCR and
partners were unable to meet
minimum education standards.

•	 In Cameroon and South Sudan,
funding shortages hampered child
protection activities. The regional
ratio of case workers to children
with specific needs was lower than
the global standard, with only one
case worker per 90 children (the
global standard is 1:25).
•	 In the DRC, provision of core
relief items and support to
income-generating activities
was inadequate, covering only
30 per cent of refugees’ needs.

Working
Environment
In 2016, UNHCR worked in the Americas
region to address challenges in responding
to the needs of increasing numbers of
displaced people, enhancing the protection
of refugees and other displaced and
stateless people, and promoting durable
solutions. Since its adoption in 2014, the
Brazil Declaration and Plan of Action (see
Glossary) has continued to be an essential
framework in the region for strengthening
protection and fostering comprehensive
solutions, in the spirit of enhanced
cooperation and solidarity.
In a major development for the region, after
four years of intensive negotiations a final
peace agreement was signed between the
Government of Colombia and the
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia
(FARC), which was approved by Congress
and entered into force on 1 December 2016.

UNHCR was assigned a role under the
peace process to support the agreement’s
peacebuilding efforts. Despite key progress
achieved following the peace agreement,
new displacement continued to take place
both inside the country and across borders,
mainly because of increased violence by
illegal armed groups. The organization also
continued to monitor the situation in volatile
regions, where armed groups appeared in
areas vacated by the FARC. Security
incidents for local social leaders have also
increased, specifically affecting supporters
of the peace process.
There were more asylum applications in the
region during 2016 than in previous years.
In the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela,
growing political, social and economic
tensions throughout the year led to the
displacement of Venezuelans. Since 2011,
over 40,000 lodged asylum claims in the
Americas and beyond, including at least
27,000 who applied in 2016 mainly in Brazil,
Costa Rica, Peru, Spain and the United
States of America. While the number of
Venezuelans granted refugee status
increased, most tried to regularize their
status under different bilateral or multilateral
regional frameworks in host countries within
the region. In the Caribbean, given the
small size of some of the island States, the
arrival of Venezuelans, even in relatively
small numbers, had a disproportionate
impact on their limited reception capacities.

(NTCA, comprising El Salvador, Guatemala
and Honduras) continued unabated,
triggered mainly by high levels of violence
stemming from organized criminal groups,
despite several positive policy and
institutional interventions by the three
Governments. In response to growing
protection needs, UNHCR launched a
supplementary appeal in June 2016, which
enabled the Office to reinforce inter-agency
protection networks, and expand
partnerships on the ground. It also
supported the authorities in countries of
origin, transit and asylum with the
implementation of protection, reception and
referral mechanisms, and advocacy and
awareness-raising activities.
In the spirit of shared responsibility and
complementary action, the region’s
governments held a High-Level Roundtable
in July 2016 to discuss a “Call to Action:
Protection Needs in the NTCA.” The
roundtable resulted in the adoption of the
San José Action Statement, which calls for a
comprehensive, multi-sectorial regional
response to address forced displacement in
Central America.
In addition, several countries in the region
continued to demonstrate solidarity with
global and regional refugee situations by
offering alternative protection solutions to
people of concern to UNHCR. In this regard,
UNHCR initiated the “Protection transfer
arrangement programme,” aiming to
evacuate people at heightened risk from
El Salvador to Costa Rica, and then from

Costa Rica to resettlement countries. Some
families have already benefited from this
programme in 2016. An important outcome
of the Leaders’ Summit on Refugees, held
in the United States in September 2016,
was the establishment of an “Emerging
resettlement countries joint support
mechanism,” a fund to support countries
setting up sustainable resettlement or
complementary pathway programmes for
refugees.

than 170 communities by deploying

more than 18,000 IDPs and members of

In Ecuador, UNHCR promoted local
integration, enabling refugees to actively
contribute to Ecuador’s development.
Around 1,500 households across the
country participated in UNHCR’s
“graduation approach” programme (see
Glossary). Important progress was also
made with regards to legal status,
registration and access to social security
and services. The National Assembly
unanimously passed a human mobility law,
which was subsequently approved in
January 2017, updating the framework for
regularizing the status of refugees and
migrants in the country and reaffirming
important principles, such as equal
treatment of all people before the law, the
principle of non-refoulement, and noncriminalization of irregular entry.
In December 2016, the Venezuelan
authorities with UNHCR’s support launched a
profiling exercise of an estimated
168,500 Colombians living in the Bolivarian
Republic of Venezuela. The results will be
used to design policies and plans to ensure
people in need of international protection
have access to solutions and are included
in national social programmes.

UNHCR GLOBAL REPORT 2016

Northern Triangle of Central
America situation
Unlike previous years, while a rising number
of asylum-seekers was recorded mainly in
Canada and the United States of America,
the steepest increase in asylum requests by
individuals from the NTCA in 2016 was
recorded in neighbouring countries. Mexico
received around 9,000 new asylum
applications, representing a 156 per cent
increase on 2015. High numbers of asylum
applications were also registered in
Costa Rica and Panama and, to a lesser
extent, in Belize and Nicaragua.
UNHCR’s 2016-2018 protection and
solutions strategy for the NTCA also aims to
respond to the most urgent needs of
refugees, asylum-seekers, returnees with
protection needs, and IDPs from the NTCA
in countries of origin, transit and asylum. In
Costa Rica and Mexico, the organization
supported asylum systems and reception
mechanisms, by providing adequate shelter
and cash assistance for vulnerable groups.
UNHCR also strengthened its cooperation
with governments in the subregion by
signing a memorandum of understanding
with Guatemala to reinforce its asylum
system and better manage mixed
movements. In addition, the Office
supported Honduran and Salvadoran
institutions dealing with displaced people,
and victims of violence in assisting their
nationals abroad in need of international
protection.

-----------------------Page 68 End-----------------------

The Americas

Finally, strategic alliances were forged with
Ombudsperson, faith-based organizations
and civil society partners to provide
protection and assistance to people and
communities affected by violence, as well
as to returnees with protection needs. The
inter-agency working groups led by UNHCR
have been key to including a protection
perspective in United Nations’ frameworks,
programmes, and groups, such as the
United Nations Development Group for
Latin America and the Caribbean.

Building a common asylum
space

Mexico amended its Constitution to include
the right to seek asylum and refugee
protection. In 2016, the Organization of
American States’ (OAS) General Assembly,
during its session in the
Dominican Republic, adopted a resolution
on human rights, which includes references
to protection of refugees and stateless
people. In addition, a separate resolution on
IDPs was adopted. Trinidad and Tobago
became the first country in the Caribbean to
use QAI standards and methodology to
develop national refugee status
determination. Other countries in the
Caribbean have also expressed interest in
doing so. In Ecuador, UNHCR has taken
measures to improve its asylum system
through capacity building and technical
support.

The Quality Assurance Initiative (QAI), which
has been implemented in Argentina, the
Plurinational State of Bolivia, Brazil, Chile,
Costa Rica, Mexico, Panama and Peru,
seeks to enhance the fairness and
efficiency of national asylum systems. As
part of this initiative, Brazil established a
registration system for asylum-seekers that
allows a more predictable and manageable
schedule for the refugee status
determination (RSD) process, resulting in
better protection against refoulement,
arrest and detention, as well as access to
assistance. Costa Rica increased the
capacity of its national eligibility bodies
both at first and second instances,
assuming greater responsibility in the
processing of asylum claims.

UNHCR continued working with
governments to promote alternatives to
detention. In Canada and the United States
of America, the implementation of the
“Beyond detention” global initiative
identified alternatives to detention for
children. In Costa Rica, UNHCR supported
the establishment of centres for migrants in
border areas, and of a shelter for female
survivors of sexual and gender-based
violence (SGBV) and lesbian, gay, bisexual,
transgender and intersex asylum-seekers.
In the northern border area, UNHCR
expanded its presence to ensure immediate
registration and effective access to RSD
procedures. In Mexico, over 2,400
asylum-seekers were housed in eight
UNHCR-supported shelters.

Rica, an agreement was concluded with the
Ministry of the Presidency and the Migration
Authority to guarantee the access of
refugees to the national development and
poverty reduction programme, facilitating
the early integration of NTCA refugees. A
shelter for women survivors of SGBV and
their children from the NTCA and Nicaragua
was also established. In Colombia, support
was provided to 92 Colombians that had
returned from Ecuador and Venezuela, as
well as to assist more than 200,000 people
with civil status documentation. UNHCR
also supported local authorities’ efforts to
legalize informal IDP settlements in urban
areas. In Ecuador, the Office signed
agreements with the Social Development
Coordination Ministry and with the Ministry
of Economic and Social Inclusion to
facilitate the integration of refugees in
national policy and programmes. UNHCR
also signed an agreement with the civil
registry to register refugees, to facilitate
their access to basic services and formal
employment.

refugee resettlement programmes. In 2016,
the United States of America welcomed
over 96,800 refugees and Canada resettled
nearly 46,300 refugees, its largest annual
refugee admission in the past two decades.
With UNHCR’s support, Canada launched a
global refugee sponsorship initiative to
bring together sponsorship groups,
international delegates, partners and
government officials. These actors shared
the experience of Canada’s private
sponsorship model for refugees, and
sought to develop practical guidance and
tools for other countries looking to adopt
similar programmes.
Argentina, Brazil, and Chile pledged to
receive refugees, especially from the Syrian
Arab Republic and the NTCA. Argentina and
Chile also advanced preparations to receive
Syrian refugees either for resettlement or
through other legal pathways such as
humanitarian visas.
In Southern Cone countries, UNHCR
enhanced its strategic partnerships with
governments, civil society and private
sector counterparts, to consolidate
protection space in the subregion,
including by establishing resettlement
programmes and other forms of admission,
and by implementing local integration
initiatives.

and Mexico

Addressing mixed
movements in
the Caribbean

In line with the San José Action Statement,
UNHCR strengthened alliances with
partners, establishing 30 agreements for
protection interventions in the NTCA.
These agreements had a crucial impact on:
child protection; community-based
protection; protection networks and border
monitoring; the strengthening of reception
centres; protection responses for cases at
heightened risk; as well as the
reinforcement of national human rights
entities (ombudsperson offices) in the three
NTCA countries.

Countries in the Caribbean continued to
receive people who arrived, in increasing
numbers, within mixed movement flows.
UNHCR developed a protection strategy to
support Caribbean States and Territories to
strengthen protection and solutions.
The strategy includes guidance on:
screening and identifying people in need of
international protection, within the context
of mixed movements; the adoption of
national asylum procedures; the
establishment of national asylum
procedures and adequate reception
facilities; access to asylum procedures; the
adoption of alternatives to detention, as
well as efforts towards local integration; and
the eradication of statelessness. In 2016,
UNHCR and its partners registered over
5,000 asylum-seekers in the Caribbean, at
least 50 per cent more than during 2015.

Following the example of the profiling
exercise carried out in Honduras, UNHCR
supported the Government of El Salvador
(Ministry of Justice and Public Safety) to
conduct a similar exercise in 2016. UNHCR
will also be supporting an academic study
on the different forms of displacement in
Guatemala. This is expected to have a
positive impact on the visibility of protection
issues related to displacement.
In hosting countries, UNHCR continues to
work with asylum-seekers and refugees,
implementing identification and referral
mechanisms, adequate reception
arrangements and alternatives to
detention.

With the support of UNHCR, IOM and the
Caribbean Community (CARICOM),
representatives from 14 States gathered for
the first substantive meeting of the
Caribbean Migration Consultations, hosted
by Trinidad and Tobago in December 2016.
They met to establish a Caribbean
Information Management Centre for
regional data collection, information sharing
and develop consistent approaches in
response to mixed movements.

Working towards eradicating
statelessness
The region saw positive developments in
efforts to eradicate statelessness. The
General Assembly of the Organization of
American States adopted a resolution on
human rights that welcomed UNHCR’s
2014-2024 Global Action Plan to End
Statelessness and endorsed the #IBelong
Campaign.
The first regional workshop on
“Statelessness and nationality for
parliamentarians from Latin America and the
Caribbean” was held in Quito, Ecuador, in
November 2016. It focused on the need to
adopt comprehensive laws to ensure the
protection of stateless people, including by
facilitating naturalization. In 2016, the
naturalization of stateless people was
included in the migratory law in Brazil and
the regulations of the civil registry in
Costa Rica.

In the Dominican Republic, important steps
were taken following the adoption of a
special law (Law 169-14) to confirm
Dominican nationality through the validation
of birth certificates belonging to individuals
born in the country to two migrant parents.
Thousands of individuals are also believed
to have been issued their Dominican civil
documents in 2016.

CONSTRAINTS
Complex mixed movements throughout the
Americas region, including a surge of
asylum-seekers from within and outside the
region, have continued to strain the
capacity of asylum countries to receive,
process and protect those in need. UNHCR
continued working with governments to
ensure access to asylum procedures for
those seeking international protection,
including through alternative case
processing strategies; however, the limited
mobilization of adequate and predictable
human and financial resources that States in
the region dedicate to ensuring that asylum
authorities have increased and sustainable
means to respond to new dynamics is a
recurring challenge.

Financial information
The original 2016 budget for the
Americas region was $115.7 million.
By the end of 2016, the budget had
been revised to $139.2 million. This
was mainly due to the inclusion of a
supplementary budget of
$16.9 million to strengthen the
regional response to the NTCA
situation in June 2016. In addition,
regional needs increased due to the
emergency response to the
earthquake in Ecuador, the
implementation of activities related
to the Brazil Plan of Action, the
resettlement of Syrian refugees in
Uruguay and activities in support of
the Syria situation.
The region received very little in the
way of earmarked funding. While
total voluntary contributions to the
region came to $37.5 million,
including 7 per cent programme
support costs, UNHCR used an
indicative amount of $36.4 million in
unearmarked funding to cover gaps,
equivalent to 12 per cent of all
unearmarked funds used in the field.

the approved budget and
accounting for approximately
2 per cent of programmed activities,
the same level as in 2015. The
region’s funding shortfall substantially
limited UNHCR’s ability to provide the
necessary technical assistance to
governments to enhance national
asylum systems and gradually
transfer responsibility to them for
RSD procedures. The lack of funding
available made itself particularly felt
in the following areas:
•	 Ensuring the availability of
effective solutions for people of
concern who were facing limited
resettlement places.

•	 A lack of local integration
alternatives and limited livelihood
support.
•	 Efficiently coordinating and
building protection and integration
networks.
•	 Facilitating access to alternative
protection mechanisms in Ecuador.
•	 Advancing the legalization of
informal settlements in Colombia,
with a high concentration of IDPs
•	 Implementing border monitoring
activities.

Working
Environment
The Asia and the Pacific region hosted
approximately 3.5 million refugees,
2.7 million IDPs and 1.6 million stateless
people, the largest concentration of
stateless people under UNHCR’s mandate
worldwide. Most displaced people were
refugees from Afghanistan and Myanmar.
While more than 2.5 million Afghan
refugees reside in more than 70 countries
around the world, nearly 95 per cent of all
documented Afghan refugees are
generously hosted in the Islamic Republics
of Iran and Pakistan.
Increasing insecurity in Afghanistan during
2016 saw the number of internally displaced
rise to 1.2 million people. Despite that, fewer
Afghans made the perilous journey to
Europe. Of the 362,000 people who risked
their lives to cross the Mediterranean Sea
to reach Europe, 10 per cent were Afghans,
mostly young men and unaccompanied
children, significantly fewer than in 2015,
when 21 per cent of arrivals by sea were
Afghans.

Asia and the Pacific

Inside Myanmar, deteriorating security in
some parts of the country resulted in
increasing levels of internal displacement,
as well as displacement across the border.
At the end of 2016, there were some
375,000 people displaced inside Myanmar
and an estimated 340,000 Myanmar
refugees in the region.
The largest movement of refugees in
South-East Asia took place in the wake of
attacks on border posts in the northern
Rakhine State of Myanmar in October 2016,
after which some 74,000 refugees crossed
from Myanmar to Bangladesh. There were,
however, no large-scale maritime
movements of refugees across the Bay of
Bengal and the Andaman Sea since
mid-2015, when the dangers of that journey
became apparent and law enforcement
efforts largely dismantled previous
smuggling networks.
Many Asian States’ leaders participated in
the September 2016 United Nations
General Assembly Summit on Refugees and
Migrants, endorsing the New York
Declaration for Refugees and Migrants,
including its annex on the Comprehensive
Refugee Response Framework (see
Glossary). Most leaders from the region also
attended the subsequent Leaders’ Summit
on Refugees, pledging to strengthen
refugee protection and seek solutions to
their plight.

UNHCR GLOBAL REPORT 2016

Although less than half of Asian countries in
the region have acceded to the 1951
Convention relating to the Status of
Refugees and its 1967 Protocol (see
Glossary), there has been a long-standing
tradition of hospitality towards displaced
people across the region. With large
numbers of people of concern moving to
urban or semi-urban areas, for employment
and for better access to basic services,
UNHCR continued working with States and
other partners to enhance protection and
assistance to those living outside of camps.

MAJOR SITUATIONS
Afghan refugees in
South-West Asia
UNHCR continued to engage with concerned
governments to implement the “Regional plan
on building resilience and solutions for
Afghan refugees in South-West Asia,” which
reiterated the principles endorsed by
governments in 2012 in the overarching
regional framework of the “Solutions strategy
for Afghan refugees to support voluntary
repatriation, sustainable reintegration and
assistance to host countries” (SSAR). Some
979,400 and 1.3 million Afghan refugees are
hosted in the Islamic Republics of Iran and
Pakistan respectively, and an estimated three
million undocumented Afghans in both
hosting countries together.

Asia and the Pacific

Violent conflict in 2016 saw the highest
number of civilian casualties recorded in a
year since 2009 when such documentation
was started by the United Nations
Assistance Mission to Afghanistan. The
violence triggered the displacement of
650,000 people inside the country, a
72 per cent increase compared with 2015,
many of whom were vulnerable and forced
to settle in areas with access to basic
services. In the second half of 2016, there
was also a sudden surge in the number of
Afghan refugees returning from Pakistan.
Some 383,900 Afghan registered refugees
returned, marking a 10-year high.
Post-return monitoring showed the reasons
for this massive increase in numbers
included harassment and pressure by
authorities and host communities; economic
hardship; introduction of enhanced border
management controls at Torkham border;
heightened anxiety over the validity of
Pakistan Government-issued proof of
registration cards; the enhanced
implementation of Pakistan’s “National
action plan” against terrorism, which
affected both Pakistani and Afghan
nationals; and the Afghan Government’s call
to Afghan refugees in Pakistan to return
home, a call which included the
government’s commitment to provide land
and shelter upon arrival. Most of the
returning Afghans came from Pakistan, with
only 2,200 Afghan refugees returning from
the Islamic Republic of Iran, and a further
690,000 undocumented Afghans having
returned from the Islamic Republics of Iran
and Pakistan.

UNHCR GLOBAL REPORT 2016

Recognizing that support for development
in Afghanistan facilitates sustainable
reintegration, donors engaged to promote
political and economic stability, as well as
the building of State capacities and
development in Afghanistan. Some
$15.2 billion were pledged by donors for
the next four years during a conference on
Afghanistan held in Brussels in October
2016. Translating commitments into action
is absolutely vital to ensure the Government
of Afghanistan has the support and
resources required to assist its population,
including uprooted people.

Solutions for people of concern
from Myanmar
In Myanmar, significant internal
displacement was triggered following an
escalation in armed conflict in the States of
Kachin and northern Shan, as well as
reported widespread human rights
violations against the Rohingya in northern
Rakhine State. In October 2016, following a
violent attack on border guard posts, an
estimated 74,000 people crossed from
northern Rakhine State into Bangladesh
because of subsequent violence. At the end
of 2016, there were an estimated
490,000 refugees from Myanmar in the
neighbouring countries. Without a ceasefire,
the situation of displaced people remains
precarious. In 2016, UNHCR continued its
strong advocacy with the Government of
Myanmar to preserving humanitarian space
and addressing protection issues related to

-----------------------Page 80 End-----------------------

Asia and the Pacific

displaced people. UNHCR also encouraged
the Government of Bangladesh to keep its
border open to people seeking safety from
violence and in urgent need of humanitarian
assistance.

Irregular mixed movements in
South-East Asia
In South-East Asia, UNHCR focused on
addressing the root causes forcing people
to risk their lives on dangerous boat
journeys and further afield. As part of the
Bali Process, Asian leaders from
41 countries adopted the “Bali Declaration
on People Smuggling, Trafficking in Persons
and Related Transnational Crime” in March
2016. The Declaration, which was largely
the result of the regional response to the
2015 Bay of Bengal crisis, highlighted the
importance of comprehensive, long-term
solutions. Commitments were made on
predictable disembarkation, reception
conditions, temporary protection, local stay
arrangements, and legal pathways for
asylum-seekers and refugees. The
Declaration encompassed some of the
elements of a regional compact on
refugees and migration, including the call
for stronger regional cooperation, increased
partnerships, and responsibility sharing. In
addition, States in South-East Asia agreed
to set up a task force on planning and
preparedness to respond to large
movements of migrants and refugees in
November 2016.

REGIONAL SUMMARIES

UNHCR continued to support the Regional
Support Office of the Bali Process, which
operates under the oversight and direction
of the Bali Process co-chairs—the
Governments of Australia and Indonesia—in
cooperation with IOM.

ACHIEVEMENTS AND
IMPACTS
Safeguarding access to
protection and asylum
In the spirit of the Bali Process and New
York Declaration, UNHCR committed to
working with States and other stakeholders
supporting joint approaches to reception,
registration, and determining international
protection needs and establishing
mechanisms, including regional schemes, to
achieve solutions for people of concern to
UNHCR.
In South-East Asia, the Government of
Thailand adopted a cabinet resolution
establishing a national screening
mechanism to distinguish refugees from
economic migrants, and UNHCR worked
with authorities to implement the necessary
procedures related to this resolution. In
India, UNHCR advocated access for
refugees to a “long-term visa” which,
among other things, allows them access to
employment, and higher education, and
open bank accounts.

In South-West Asia, UNHCR worked with
the Government of Pakistan to address
reported cases of unlawful arrests and
detention of refugees. The Office
advocated for the extension of the validity
of refugees’ proof of registration cards
until the end of 2017, and welcomed the
Federal Cabinet of Pakistan’s adoption of
a national policy relating to the
management of refugees and Afghan
nationals. Furthermore, through the
refugee affected and hosting areas
initiative, inter-linked interventions were
implemented in education, skills training
and livelihoods, to empower youth.
UNHCR also promoted the inclusion and
access of Afghan refugees in national and
public services.
In the Islamic Republic of Iran, great strides
were made to improve refugees’ access to
health care, as UNHCR supported the
national authorities in implementing the
second phase of the country’s universal
public health insurance scheme to include
registered refugees. The Iranian
Government also implemented the
presidential decree adopted in 2016,
allowing undocumented Afghan children to
enrol in local schools. As a result, some
48,000 undocumented Afghan children
enrolled during the year.

UNHCR GLOBAL REPORT 2016

Seeking durable solutions for
protracted refugee situations
In line with the “Regional plan on building
resilience and solutions for Afghan refugees
in South-West Asia” and the SSAR
framework, the Islamic Republics of
Afghanistan, Iran and Pakistan participated
in tripartite and quadripartite meetings with
UNHCR to coordinate efforts at securing
durable solutions for Afghan refugees. In
mid-2016, the repatriation of Afghan
refugees from Pakistan increased to some
370,000. While the increased cash grant
supported returnees during the initial return
period, UNHCR also strongly advocated for
overall reintegration needs and access to
basic services to be addressed in
Afghanistan’s national development plans.
In particular, the Office played a proactive
role to ensure that their needs were
included in the plans of the newly
established interministerial Displacement
and Return Executive Committee.
With respect to Myanmar, a pilot voluntary
return exercise was carried out with the
support of the Governments of Myanmar
and Thailand. UNHCR facilitated the return
of 71 Myanmar refugees to South East
Myanmar. These first returns will pave the
way for a process of voluntary repatriation

-----------------------Page 82 End-----------------------

Asia and the Pacific

that could eventually resolve one of Asia’s
most protracted refugee situations.
In 2016, some 850 Sri Lankan refugees
returned from India, a 50 per cent increase
on 2015. In India, UNHCR disseminated
information on voluntary return through
refugee communities and provided
logistical support and return assistance. In
Sri Lanka, the Office assisted returnees
upon arrival, providing cash grants as well
as core relief items (CRIs). Protection
monitoring in areas of return, following
registration, served as a tool for advocacy
and referral to other services, including
legal advice on housing, land and property
issues, and documentation.
In Nepal, a major milestone was reached in
terms of large-scale resettlement. Over
107,000 refugees from Bhutan were
resettled out of camps to third countries.
UNHCR continued advocating durable
solutions for around 10,000 refugees who
remained in camps.
Australia, Japan and the Republic of Korea
welcomed a number of refugees, including
Myanmar refugees, for resettlement during
the year. Australia announced a bilateral
agreement with the United States of
America to consider the resettlement of

|

REGIONAL SUMMARIES

refugees currently residing in regional
processing centres in Nauru and Papua
New Guinea for resettlement in the United
States of America. In view of the urgent
humanitarian needs of these populations,
UNHCR agreed to support the process
under certain conditions.

In Nepal, over
107,000 refugees
from Bhutan were
resettled.

Ensuring protection and
durable solutions for IDPs
The Government of Afghanistan
established an interministerial coordination
body, the Displacement and Return
Executive Committee, to strengthen
essential services and develop
reintegration prospects for displaced and
returning populations, including for host
communities. UNHCR contributed
proactively to the elaboration of the
comprehensive reintegration plan and has
committed to support its implementation,
particularly in the area of protection. In
2016, UNHCR carried out 55 communitybased projects in 93 locations in
Afghanistan, to the benefit of some
58,750 IDPs, host communities and
returnees. The Office also supported
around 24,000 households, mainly IDPs,
during the winter period with cash
assistance and CRIs.

2015, more than 1.3 million IDPs have
returned to their areas of origin. The
Government plans to facilitate the return of
the remaining 450,000 IDPs by mid-2017
with UNHCR support.
While humanitarian access remained
challenging in Myanmar, UNHCR worked
with partners and the Government to
protect and assist IDPs in Kachin and
Rakhine States as part of its inter-agency
response. It advocated regular
humanitarian access to all affected
populations in the areas of conflict.
Positive developments were made in
Sri Lanka in addressing the rights and
needs of IDPs, returnees and other
people of concern, through the adoption
of the “National policy on durable
solutions for conflict-affected
displacement” in August 2016.
Consequently, UNHCR reoriented its IDP
operation and continued to advocate for
the Government and development
partners to play a greater role in ensuring
the sustainable return of Sri Lankan
refugees and the reintegration of IDPs.

UNHCR GLOBAL REPORT 2016

Reducing and preventing
statelessness and protecting
stateless people
Throughout 2016, progress was made in
the region to prevent and reduce
statelessness, with the support of UNHCR
and civil society actors. In Myanmar, UNHCR
continued to advocate resolving citizenship
issues through an inclusive citizenship
verification process accepted by all
communities, and the amendment of
citizenship laws to ensure they are in line
with international standards guaranteeing
the right to a nationality.
The Government of Thailand, in support of
the #IBelong Campaign to End
Statelessness, announced a series of policy
measures to further prevent and reduce
statelessness. In December 2016, the Thai
Cabinet also approved a resolution
providing guidance and additional
measures to address problems relating to
the legal status of stateless persons and the
issue of statelessness. These measures
aimed to support previously established
ones by expanding eligibility criteria for
nationality and clarifying application
processes, as well as focusing on resolving

-----------------------Page 84 End-----------------------

Asia and the Pacific

statelessness amongst children and
students. UNHCR, in partnership with other
actors, supported these efforts by assisting
stateless individuals to apply for nationality.
Since 2012, more than 27,000 stateless
people were granted Thai nationality,
including 8,814 in 2016.
Together with UNHCR, the Governments of
Indonesia and the Philippines assisted
people of Indonesian descent residing in
Mindanao in the southern Philippines. Out of
the registered population of 8,745, some
4,110 people of Indonesian descent were
confirmed as Indonesian, Filipino or dual
nationals in 2016. In Malaysia, UNHCR
supported NGOs in providing legal
assistance to stateless people for them to
apply for nationality. More than
1,400 stateless people of the
12,350 registered with UNHCR’s partner had
acquired Malaysian nationality, and more
than 11,000 nationality applications
submitted to the local authorities were
awaiting a decision. In April 2017, the Prime
Minister’s Office issued the Malaysian Indian
Blueprint which includes a target to “resolve
stateless and documentation issues” of
people of Indian descent living in Malaysia
within five years of implementation, with a
priority on children and youth.
In Central Asia, at least 11,000 people
acquired a nationality or had their
nationality confirmed in 2016. Kazakhstan,

|

REGIONAL SUMMARIES

Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan also made
legislative changes, with a view to
preventing and reducing statelessness.
The President of Uzbekistan signed a
decree by which 179 stateless people
became Uzbek nationals in December
2016, and Turkmenistan granted nationality
to more than 1,380 stateless people in a
single day.

CONSTRAINTS
Limited humanitarian access continued to
impede UNHCR’s work in Afghanistan and
Myanmar. The safety of humanitarian
workers remained of grave concern,
particularly for national staff who were
especially exposed to attacks and the risk
of collateral damage.
The lack of a legal framework to anchor
protection and solutions for UNHCR’s
people of concern continued to be a
challenge in the region. Only 20 of the
45 countries and territories in the Asia and
the Pacific region had acceded to the
1951 Convention Relating to the Status of
Refugees and its 1967 Protocol.
Shrinking financial resources had several
effects on operations, including UNHCR’s
ability to carry out comprehensive
protection and response, and to find
solutions for different populations of
concern.

Asia and the Pacific

Financial information
The original 2016 budget for Asia
and the Pacific region amounted to
$534.3 million. The revised 2016
budget increased to $671 million,
mainly due to additional
requirements to cover the cash
grant for the increasing number of
Afghan refugee returns from
Pakistan to Afghanistan.
Earmarked contributions to Asia and
the Pacific came to $293 million,
including 7 per cent programme
support costs, which left 56 per cent
of the region’s needs unmet.
UNHCR used an indicative amount
of $99.3 million in unearmarked
funding in the region to cover gaps,
equivalent to 32 per cent of all
unearmarked funds used in the field.
Expenditure in Asia and the Pacific
increased in 2016, amounting to
$375.7 million, or 9.5 per cent of
programmed activities as compared
to 7.8 per cent in 2015,
with 77 per cent of expenditure in
South-West Asia. The operations with
largest expenditures were
Afghanistan ($197.8 million) and
Pakistan ($54.7 million), responding
to needs associated with the
Afghanistan situation. The remaining
23 per cent of the budget went to
small and medium-sized operations,
including Myanmar and countries
receiving refugees from Myanmar.
The budget for smaller operations
(excluding Myanmar and countries
receiving refugees from Myanmar)
had shrunk by 34 per cent since
2012. The region’s funding shortfall

84

•

UNHCR GLOBAL REPORT 2016

limited UNHCR’s ability to carry out
its life-saving work in the region as
well as a decrease in human
resources which seriously impacted
on UNHCR’s presence and its ability
to implement activities. The lack of
funding available made itself
particularly felt in the following areas:
•	 In the Islamic Republic of Iran,
UNHCR was able to support
only 117,530 vulnerable refugees
to access the national health
insurance scheme, while many
other refugees faced financial
challenges to pay the premium.
Inadequate access to health
insurance prevented a number
of adults from receiving health
care, often leading to serious
protections problems within the
family such as a recourse to child
labour.

•	 In Pakistan, an estimated 20,000
to 40,000 out-of-school refugee
children could not access
education. In many cases, girls
had to interrupt their education
as UNHCR was no longer able to
provide classes beyond grade 6
in the settlements, and some
parents objected for cultural
reasons to their daughters
attending public schools, thus
increasing the risks of early
marriage and pregnancies of
teenage girls.
•	 In Malaysia, UNHCR and partner
agencies were unable to provide
basic support to 37 per cent of the
identified vulnerable people.
•	 In Myanmar, with over 86,000 IDPs
in need of shelter repair, UNHCR
was not able to cover all needs.

Working
Environment
Seeking safety and protection in Europe, an
estimated 362,000 people risked their lives
crossing the Mediterranean Sea in 2016,
with 181,400 people arriving in Italy and
173,450 in Greece. Children accounted for
just over a quarter of arrivals, many of them
unaccompanied, separated from caregivers,
and needing specific attention. The
Mediterranean Sea proved ever more
perilous to people trying to cross it. While in
2015, some 3,770 refugees or migrants died
or went missing trying to cross it, that figure
rose to more than 5,000 people in 2016.
The Balkans continued to see significant
onward movements, although movement
from Serbia to Hungary slowed as most
people were obliged to pass through transit
zones operated by the Hungarian
authorities. In 2016, Europe received nearly
1.2 million new asylum applications, with
applicants originating mainly from
Afghanistan, Iraq and the Syrian Arab
Republic (Syria) – 9 per cent more than the
same period in 2015.

Significant challenges persist in providing
protection and securing solutions for
displaced people in the region, including
increasing restrictions on access to territory;
a lack of appropriate reception conditions,
particularly for people with specific needs,
such as unaccompanied and separated
children; and inadequate asylum
procedures. Against this background, the
European Commission announced a series
of proposals in 2016 aimed at amending the
current Common European Asylum System
(CEAS), including the reform of Frontex and
the European Asylum Support Office
(EASO).
Working with governments and other
partners, UNHCR focused on access to
asylum and the development of fair and
effective asylum systems, with special
attention for unaccompanied and separated
children, and integration-related support
and family reunification. Furthermore, the
Office tirelessly advocated for a
coordinated and comprehensive policy and
operational response to gaps in national
asylum systems, and approaches based on
solidarity and responsibility-sharing among
European States, which, in parallel,
supported emergency response such as the
provision of reception conditions.
By the end of 2016, Europe hosted
approximately 10.2 million of people of
concern, including 6.6 million asylumseekers and refugees, 3 million IDPs
(including returnees) and more than
570,000 stateless people.

UNHCR GLOBAL REPORT 2016

MAJOR SITUATIONS
Mediterranean situation
The large number of refugees moving
through the region, the unpredictability of
their movements, and the continuously
shifting travel routes they adopted, made
the distribution of assistance and extension
of protection to people with specific needs
particularly challenging in 2016. Although
the European Union-Turkey statement of
March 2016 resulted in a substantial change
in the situation, with significantly fewer
people trying to reach Greece from Turkey.
Simultaneously, the de facto closure of the
western Balkans route led to a rapid rise in
the number of people in Greece.
Consequently, UNHCR needed to rapidly
shift and expand its operational response in
countries where it had previously focused
on advocacy. It launched a Refugee
Emergency Response in Europe
supplementary appeal, as well as an interagency regional Refugee and Migrant
Response Plan for Europe (RMRP) in 2016.
In Greece, while there had been
improvements in some sites, unmet needs
remained significant. Living conditions in
many of the sites, both on the islands and
the mainland, have deteriorated due both to
congestion and the harsh climactic
conditions at the end of the year, particularly
concerning for people with specific needs,
such as unaccompanied or separated
children. UNHCR and its partners
consequently focused on improving existing

reception capacity and facilities by, for
example, sending additional relief items to
help people at the sites bear winter

there was heating, and introducing prefabricated housing units. The Office helped
more than 20,000 people access alternative
urban accommodation, such as in rented
apartments, hotels or with host families,
including 700 places for unaccompanied
children; and nearly 16,000 people
benefited from the accommodation scheme
through cash-based interventions.

Turkey continued to host the largest
number of refugees under UNHCR’s
mandate worldwide, with 2.8 million Syrian
refugees at the end of 2016, of which less
than 10 per cent live in camps, It also hosts
almost 250,000 asylum-seekers and
refugees from elsewhere. Syrian refugees
continued to benefit from temporary
protection, as well as access to education,
health and the labour market. Under the
Regional Refugee and Resilience Plan (3RP),
UNHCR continued to support Turkey’s
implementation of the temporary protection

regulation and Syrians’ access to rights and
entitlements. Positive steps were made in
term of access for Syrian refugees to
education and livelihood opportunities,
particularly the Turkish authorities’ issuing
of 13,000 work permits to Syrian refugees in
2016.
In the western Balkans, the resumption of
irregular movements saw groups of people
gathering at various border points, including
at the Serbia-Hungary border, where
physical barriers and legal restrictions had
been established. UNHCR refocused its
response on protection monitoring
interventions, advocacy and the building of
national protection systems, after efforts
were shifted to Greece.

to strengthen collaboration and
coordination of activities, enhance freedom
of movement for IDPs, harmonize legislative
frameworks, and facilitate dialogue with
IDPs and civil society.
UNHCR continued working within the
inter-agency framework for IDPs, leading the
protection and shelter clusters. The Office
promoted freedom of movement across the
contact line between government-controlled
areas and non-government-controlled areas
and access to rights and entitlements.
Significant material assistance was provided,
including core relief items and/or winterization
items, such as blankets and stoves, as well as
cash grants, and construction materials.
UNHCR worked with communities to
implement 34 quick impact projects, including
establishing community centres with free
legal aid offices, and creating suitable
conditions for a children’s trauma hospital,
contributing to better quality health services
in non-government-controlled areas.

More than 1.8 million people remained
internally displaced in Ukraine, with the
United Nations estimating between
800,000 and 1 million people displaced
within the government-controlled areas. In
addition to IDPs, some 270,000 Ukrainians
sought asylum abroad, mainly in Belarus,
Poland and the Russian Federation, with
10,375 new asylum applications during 2016
by Ukrainians in Europe, primarily in
Germany, Italy and Spain.

ACHIEVEMENTS AND
IMPACT

To respond to IDP protection needs in
eastern Ukraine, the Ukrainian Ministry of
Temporarily Occupied Territories and
Internally Displaced Persons was
established in April 2016. UNHCR and the
Ministry signed a letter of understanding in
October 2016, which provided a framework

Although UNHCR worked closely with
governments and NGO partners in
countries affected by large-scale arrivals, by
supporting national and local authorities in
mitigating protection risks, most emergency
response work was delivered in Greece
during 2016. The Office focused on the

UNHCR GLOBAL REPORT 2016

movements by sea

Europe

provision of immediate, life-saving
assistance, in support of the response by
the Government and local communities.
More than 20,000 people in 16 sites
received emergency winterized shelter and
at least 300,000 core relief items were
delivered, with particular attention given to
those with specific needs.
UNHCR and partners provided legal
counselling services to new arrivals on the
Greek islands and at land border crossings,
as well as at reception centres in southeastern Europe and other locations
frequented by refugees and migrants on
the move. At some critical transit points,
legal assistance was available 24 hours a
day, seven days a week. Measures to
prevent and respond to protection risks,
including SGBV and family separation, were
established. Child protection mechanisms
were enhanced, including ensuring
decisions were in the best interests of
children, as were mechanisms for
identification and referral of those with
specific needs. UNHCR also strengthened
communication with communities to better
target protection interventions and
assistance, and to identify and address
information needs.

Safeguarding asylum space
and providing acceptable
reception conditions
UNHCR continued advocating the reflection
of international protection standards in the
European Union’s border management
policy, particularly given the transitioning of

REGIONAL SUMMARIES

the European Union border agency,
Frontex, to the new European Border and
Coast Guard Agency. Through robust
cooperation and its chairmanship of the
Frontex consultative forum on fundamental
rights, UNHCR played a key monitoring role
by responding to practices that potentially
compromised access to international
protection in the European Union.

More than 20,000
people in 16 sites
received emergency
winterized shelter
and at least
300,000 core relief
items were
delivered in Greece

The Office continued to monitor access to
territory, asylum and other relevant
procedures across Europe, through border
monitoring and capacity building for
authorities. It also advocated appropriate
reception conditions and alternatives to
detention for new arrivals. In southern
Europe, UNHCR worked closely with
Frontex and EASO to ensure access to
asylum and the provision of protectioncentred assistance, including safe and
dignified reception facilities, relocation
efforts and family reunification, where
relevant. In Greece, UNHCR and EASO
supported the Greek Asylum Service in
carrying out a pre-registration exercise for
nearly 27,600 individuals. Despite the
efforts of Greek authorities, UNHCR, NGOs,
volunteer groups and other partners to
improve conditions at accommodation sites,
refugees and other people of concern
continued to move from Greece, including
to reunite with family members already in
the European Union. In Italy, UNHCR
worked with local authorities to support the
European Union’s relocation scheme from
Italy, and assisted with the establishment of
adequate reception conditions and
procedures sensitive to the specific needs
of people of concern, particularly of

unaccompanied and separated children.
The Office also maintained a regular
presence in the Spanish autonomous cities
of Ceuta and Melilla.

stepped up efforts towards a more
coherent, solidarity-based and
protection-focused system, sensitive to
people with specific needs.

People moving irregularly in Central Europe
and the western Balkans were vulnerable to
smugglers and criminal organizations, with
pushbacks and collective expulsions
resulting in limited access to adequate
protection. UNHCR strengthened its
cooperation with relevant actors to meet
the specific needs of the large number of
unaccompanied and separated children.
With the Serbian authorities, the Office
carried out a joint reception standards
assessment to define how accommodation
facilities needed to be upgraded and to
ensure reception conditions were in line
with international protection standards. In
addition, it stockpiled sufficient emergency
shelter and core relief items to assist the
authorities. Collectively, these efforts saw
space at government-organized
accommodation increase from 2,000 to
more than 6,000 places, of which close to
4,000 were suitable for long-term
occupancy.

Throughout 2016, the European
Commission released a number of
proposals to reform the CEAS and prevent
irregular onward movements. UNHCR
expressed concern about some of them,
including the introduction of mandatory
admissibility procedures in the absence of
independent, reliable and updated
information on the situation in a country
deemed “safe” for return by
asylum-seekers. The Office published a
paper entitled “Better protecting refugees
in the EU and globally” in December 2016,
which aimed to rebuild trust through better
management, partnership and solidarity. It
outlined how accelerated procedures and
distribution mechanisms prioritizing family
reunion, and substantive links with
Member States, could achieve a more
manageable and coherent common asylum
system.

Building and maintaining fair
and effective asylum and

Large-scale arrivals saw some European
Union countries increasingly resort to
detention. UNHCR supported further
development of EASO and Frontex, and
reinforced its cooperation with the judiciary
across Europe, at national levels and before
the European Court of Human Rights and
the Court of Justice of the European Union.
The organization intervened as a third party
in selected cases affecting people of
concern.

Europe

In Eastern Europe, the “quality initiative”
provided a regional forum for governments
to exchange asylum-related challenges,
facilitating partnerships, strengthening
access to territory, asylum and refugee
status determination (RSD), and enhancing
the quality of judicial review. The target
audiences included first-instance decision
makers, border guards and members of the
judiciary in Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus,
Georgia, the Republic of Moldova and
Ukraine.
In Turkey, UNHCR and the Government
resumed the negotiations process to
transition from UNHCR RSD procedures for
non-Syrian asylum-seekers to a
Government-led system. The organization
will continue registration and RSD activities
until the hand-over is completed.
UNHCR also supported local authorities in
several European countries to establish
appropriate protection systems for
unaccompanied and separated children,
including in terms of provision of
information and referral, identification and
best interests procedures.

Securing durable solutions

partnership mechanisms for facilitating
migration, in line with the “2030 Agenda for
Sustainable Development.”
The Office advocated the expansion of safe
and legal pathways to protection across
Europe, published recommendations on the
proposed European Union resettlement
framework, and remained actively engaged
with those negotiating draft legislation. In
2016, almost 13,900 people were resettled
to Europe, including around 2,760 from
Turkey under the European Union-Turkey
statement. Since 2013, 25 European
countries pledged some 112,300 places for
Syrian refugees for resettlement and other
forms of admission. UNHCR continued to
advocate targeted increases in funding
mechanisms relevant to refugee integration,
and the reinforcement of measures
outlined in the European Commission’s
Action Plan on the integration of
third-country nationals. Internal relocation
from within the European Union continued
at a slow pace, with only 8,160 of a
targeted 160,000 relocated.

In 2016, almost

UNHCR supported the governments of
south-eastern Europe to fully assume
responsibility for finding durable solutions
for remaining IDPs. Some particularly
vulnerable groups, such as Roma, remain in
need. UNHCR continued to offer legal
counselling for all those still in need of
solutions or at risk of statelessness.

Europe

Preventing and resolving
statelessness
Building on the 2015 European Union
Council conclusions on statelessness,
UNHCR supported the European Migration
Network’s platform on statelessness in the
European Union as it evaluated Member
States’ approaches to statelessness. With
the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), the Office
for Democratic Institutions and Human
Rights, and the OSCE High Commissioner
on National Minorities, UNHCR jointly
drafted a “Handbook on statelessness in
the OSCE area: international standards and
good practices.” This practical tool outlined
ways the 57 participating OSCE States
could address statelessness.
There were no new accessions to the
statelessness conventions in 2016, but
steps towards better prevention of
statelessness at birth were taken in Norway,
where an instruction now permits children
born stateless in the country to apply for
and acquire Norwegian citizenship.
Luxembourg and the Netherlands also
introduced bills to improve safeguards
against statelessness for children born in
the country. In south-eastern Europe,
UNHCR and partners helped those in need
of civil registration and documentation. In
Serbia, a survey found the number of
people without identity documents among
Ashkalis, Egyptians and Romas had
dropped from 6.8 per cent to 3.9 per cent
within the past four years (2012-2016).

UNHCR GLOBAL REPORT 2016

Consultations with Latvia continued on
matters pertaining to the situation of the
“non-citizen” population. In Belarus,
stateless people were increasingly
documented and able to enjoy their socioeconomic rights. As a result, the overall
number of stateless people considerably
decreased due to naturalization.

Constraints
While UNHCR continued to call on
European States to demonstrate more
responsibility sharing, as well as for
solidarity and trust, the erosion of protection
space remained challenging. The right-wing
populist narrative and xenophobia remained
part of public discourse in many European
countries, increasing pressure to impose
more restrictive legislation, limiting access
to territory and national asylum systems,
and giving rise to a potential risk of direct or
indirect refoulement. Many countries along
the western Balkans route passed
legislation that placed increased limitations
on the ability of various refugee groups to
access asylum systems.
Inadequate reception conditions and
facilities exposed asylum-seekers and
refugees to extreme protection risks,
homelessness, and limited integration
opportunities, and contributed to an
environment in which criminal networks
could thrive.
Despite many refugees already in Europe
being legally entitled to family reunification,

-----------------------Page 98 End-----------------------

Europe

in practice there were many obstacles that
delayed or prevented refugees reuniting
with immediate family members. With
limited legal pathways available to people
seeking international protection to enter
Europe, many felt dangerous journeys were
their only option.

|

REGIONAL SUMMARIES

UNHCR remained concerned that several
States felt other countries or regions were
better suited to processing asylum claims.
This seemed, at times, like an attempt to
collectively shift responsibility to States
already overwhelmed by the number of
refugees on their territories, or in conflict.

Financial information
The 2016 budget for the Europe
region initially totalled $516.9 million.
At the end of the year, the revised
2016 budget increased to
$877.9 million, due to additional
financial requirements including a
supplementary appeal for the
refugee emergency response in
Europe and the response for Syrian
refugees in Turkey.
Earmarked contributions to Europe
came to $424.8 million, including
7 per cent programme support
costs, which left 52 per cent of the
region’s needs unmet. UNHCR used
an indicative amount of $46 million
in unearmarked funding to cover
gaps, equivalent to 15 per cent of all
unearmarked funds used in the field.

with the situations in the
Mediterranean and Syria.
The region’s funding shortfall limited
UNHCR’s ability to deliver assistance
and protection to people of concern,
particularly for those displaced due
to conflict in Syria. The lack of
funding available made itself
particularly felt in the following
areas:

•	 Providing protection and
assistance for those displaced due
to the conflict in Ukraine.
•	 Reducing the number of smallscale projects implemented
and limited livelihood support in
Eastern Europe.
•	 Assisting refugees for voluntary
return to Kosovo (S/RES/1244
(1999))*.

Working
Environment
Intensified violence, sectarian strife, and an
escalation of human trafficking and people
smuggling in 2016 led to increasing levels
of displacement across the Middle East and
North Africa region. Of the estimated
67.7 million people worldwide of concern to
UNHCR, more than 28 per cent are in this
region, including 2.6 million refugees,
15.1 million IDPs and returnees, and an
estimated 372,500 stateless.
In 2016, UNHCR and its partners were faced
with the continued imperative to address
the needs stemming from three systemwide, Level 3 emergencies (see Responding
with lifesaving support chapter and
Glossary) in Iraq, the Syrian Arab Republic
(Syria), and Yemen. Providing protection
and advocating for protection space,
supporting access to asylum, expanding
opportunities for durable solutions for
refugees and IDPs, and strengthening
support for the IDP response, were
UNHCR’s priorities in 2016. The Office
worked with partners to maximize the
delivery of assistance and protection to the
most vulnerable, providing shelter, core
relief items (CRIs), and cash-based
interventions in camps and urban settings.

MAJOR SITUATIONS
Syria situation
Humanitarian needs in Syria reached a
record high in 2016, with 13.5 million
people in need of humanitarian
assistance, including 6.3 million IDPs and
2.8 million children. Overall, violations of
international human rights and
humanitarian law perpetrated mostly with
impunity impeded humanitarian access to
people in need. An estimated 4.72 million
people lived in hard-to-reach and
besieged locations inside Syria, and
thousands were stranded at the borders,
unable to seek safety in neighbouring
countries. In addition, intense fighting in
northern Syria, especially in Aleppo,
resulted in the new displacement of
400,000 people in 2016. The coping
mechanisms of IDPs and host
communities were all but exhausted, with
more than half of Syria’s hospitals
destroyed or badly damaged; roughly a
quarter of schools damaged, destroyed or
used as collective shelters; and an
estimated 1.2 million houses damaged or
destroyed. This left more than 2.4 million
people in need of shelter.
As part of the “Whole of Syria” response,
UNHCR enhanced its leadership and
coordination role in the protection, camp
coordination and camp management
(CCCM), and shelter/non-food items (NFIs)
clusters. The Office delivered protection
assistance to more than 2 million people in 11
out of 14 governorates, NFIs to some
4 million people in 13 governorates, and
health services to almost 700,000 people in
six governorates including in hard-to-reach
areas. Cross-line delivery assisted more than
1.1 million people in 39 locations inside Syria.

UNHCR GLOBAL REPORT 2016

At the end of 2016, there were nearly
5 million Syrian refugees in neighbouring
countries, including in Turkey (2.86 million),
Lebanon (1 million), Jordan (685,200),
Iraq (261,900) and Egypt (213,900) reflecting
the continued strong commitment and
generosity of host countries. In London, at
the February 2016 conference on
“Supporting Syria and the region,” the
Syrian hosting countries pledged their
support to education, livelihoods and
employment, which were complemented by
donor countries’ commitments in the spirit
of responsibility-sharing. Examples of
progress in these areas included:
expanding labour market access to
refugees; the reform of regulatory
frameworks; improving the business climate
to attract more investment; and increasing
trade opportunities to support longer-term
growth.
Across the region, however, most refugees
live below the poverty line and access to
food, housing, and health care is
challenging. In 2016 in Lebanon,
70 per cent of Syrian refugee households
were living below the poverty line, as well
as 93 per cent of Syrian refugees living
outside of camps in Jordan, 65 per cent in
Egypt, and 37 per cent in Iraq.
Together with UNDP, UNHCR continued to
lead the Regional Refugee and Resilience
Plan (3RP), a coordinated response of over
240 partners in support of the national
response plans of the five main Syrian
refugee-hosting countries. The 3RP has
been an innovative example of partnerships
with development actors in addressing
displacement, building resilience and laying
the groundwork for solutions.

Iraq situation
The humanitarian crisis in Iraq deepened,
with the country experiencing successive
waves of mass displacement. More than
10 million Iraqis were estimated to need
some form of humanitarian assistance.
There were at least 3.6 million IDPs in the
country, for whom internal displacement
remained highly fluid and volatile. As many
families experienced multiple
displacements, their vulnerability to
economic and protection-related shocks
increased. Since October 2016, an
additional 130,000 became internally
displaced from the city of Mosul and its
surrounding areas, continuing into 2017.

Population size

Libya situation
The volatile security and the political
situation in Libya continued to impact
civilians, and made humanitarian access
even more challenging. Those affected
included more than 300,000 IDPs,
450,000 returnees, and 39,000 refugees
and asylum-seekers registered inside the
country. To reach vulnerable displaced
people across the country, UNHCR
expanded its partner network, which
resulted in the delivery of CRIs and cash
grants to over 5,200 IDP families in 2016
around Tripoli, Misrata, Benghazi and
Alkhums and the western part of Libya.
The Office also stepped up its outreach to
refugees and asylum-seekers, with the
opening of a third community development
centre located in Tripoli, and increased
visits to detention facilities.

The prolonged conflict in Yemen required a
sustained Level 3 emergency response. An
estimated 18.8 million of the country’s
27.4 million people—nearly 70 per cent of
the population—needed humanitarian
assistance in 2016, particularly food, health
and shelter being the most pressing needs.
With some 280,000 refugees and
asylum-seekers in the country, Yemen
remained a generous host. UNHCR provided
continued protection and life-saving
assistance to refugees and asylum-seekers,
advocated for access of refugees to public
health and education services, and provided
emergency response to over 700,000 of the
most vulnerable IDPs and returnees.

Achievements
and impact
Maintaining protection space
and supporting access to
national asylum systems
UNHCR conducted individual biometric
registration for Iraqi, Syrian and other
refugees throughout the region. In Turkey,
the Office supported the Government to
develop a project to verify and upgrade the
registration data of Syrian refugees. Within
the framework of the 3RP, the Office
prioritized efforts ensuring all refugee births
were registered and documented, and that
unaccompanied children were identified
and assisted.
In line with the commitments made at the
London conference, positive developments
were made in supporting Syrian refugees’
access to livelihoods. For example, work
permits were issued to 37,000 Syrian
refugees in Jordan and 13,000 refugees in
Turkey, and Syrian refugee medical
professionals and teachers were permitted
to provide services to refugee communities
in Turkey.
Community-based protection and two-way
communication with refugees were pursued
as a means to ensure accountability and
promote empowerment.

Middle East and North Africa

UNHCR and partners strengthened
protection monitoring through systematic
data collection by community-based actors,
and analysis using innovative technology
providing the basis for legal aid,
documentation, and support to vulnerable
individuals. Across 3RP countries, a network
of 250 community centres and
900 community workers worked with
support committees and mobile teams in
pursuit of sustainable protection responses
capable of addressing child protection and
sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV)
concerns. New partnerships were forged to
address challenges affecting youths’ access
to tertiary educational opportunities.
Interventions by UNHCR and partners were
able to significantly reduce the percentage
of Syrian refugee children born in the
region without any form of identity
documents from 35 per cent in 2012 to
3 per cent in 2016.
In North Africa, UNHCR continued to advise
and provide targeted training for
government officials to gradually put in
place a national asylum legislation and
hand over registration and refugee status
determination processes. In Morocco,
refugee status determination of UNHCRregistered asylum-seekers was carried out
jointly with Moroccan authorities. In Libya
and Tunisia, the organization provided
technical training to government officials
and civil society actors on rescue at sea.

REGIONAL SUMMARIES

Strengthening refugee
protection in mixed
movements
The central Mediterranean route (through
North Africa to Italy) remained the main
channel used by people trying to reach
Europe from Africa. There were more than
181,400 arrivals in Europe by sea in 2016,
with the majority departing from Libya to
reach Italy. At least 5,000 people were
reported to have died or gone missing in
the Mediterranean, making it the deadliest
year to date. The number of
asylum-seekers, refugees and migrants
using the eastern Mediterranean route
(from Turkey to Greece) in 2016 dropped
significantly following the simultaneous
effective closure of the Balkans route and
the European Union-Turkey statement of
March 2016. In view of large-scale irregular
mixed movements (see Glossary), and to
prevent refoulement, UNHCR worked to
safeguard access to territory, ensuring
rescue at sea and protection for people of
concern.
In Libya, the Office strengthened
cooperation with the Libyan Coast Guard
and immigration authorities by establishing
two additional health posts at
disembarkation points, to provide
emergency assistance to those rescued at
sea. In addition, UNHCR successfully
advocated the release from detention of

578 people in need of international
protection and provided life-saving
humanitarian assistance at five points of
disembarkation, following rescue or
interception at sea.
In Tunisia, UNHCR continued to provide
capacity building to the authorities to
improve monitoring at the border with Libya
and strengthen capacity for rescue at sea.

Providing safety from violence
and exploitation
Child protection and the prevention of, and
response to, SGBV were key elements of
UNHCR’s operations in the region. In 2016,
almost 700,000 girls and boys in the region
benefited from the organization’s child
protection, psychological and social support
programmes. Some 131,500 survivors of
SGBV, including men and boys, were given
access to multi-sectoral services.
Furthermore, UNHCR continued to promote
active and equal participation by women in
leadership and management structures and
equal access to livelihood opportunities,
especially for women heads of households.
Inside Syria, SGBV awareness sessions
reached nearly 100,000 IDPs in collective
shelters and community centres in different
governorates. A specific focus on children
and youth remained an important element
of the response throughout the region,
including addressing longer-term care
arrangements and durable solutions for
unaccompanied and separated children,
addressing child labour, and improving
children’s access to safe learning
environments.

•

UNHCR GLOBAL REPORT 2016

UNHCR and partners also supported
youth-led initiatives in communities and
facilitated refugee youths’ participation in
regional and global events, including youth
consultations in Jordan, Morocco and Turkey.

Pursuing durable solutions
Together with resettlement countries and
other partners, UNHCR continued working
towards durable solutions for an increasing
number of vulnerable refugees. In 2016,
based on robust and harmonized
methodologies to identify the most
vulnerable, some 96,000 refugees from the
region had their applications for
resettlement submitted to 30 countries,
including 77,200 Syrian and 12,800 Iraqi
refugees.
Furthermore, UNHCR continued advocating
alternative pathways for the admission of
refugees to third countries, including the
use of humanitarian visas, communitybased private sponsorship, labour mobility
schemes, and family reunification.

Responding to new
emergencies
Emergency preparedness and response to
fresh instances of displacement continued
to constitute essential features of the
Level 3 emergency response in Iraq, Syria
and Yemen. In Mauritania, UNHCR
continued assisting at least 46,000 Malian
refugees in Mbera camp and provided
emergency assistance to more than
4,000 people fleeing violence, which
erupted in September 2016 in Mali,
triggering a new influx of refugees towards
Mauritania.

-----------------------Page 108 End-----------------------

Middle East and North Africa

Building partnerships with local
organizations and civil society
UNHCR enhanced strategic partnerships in
the region, including cooperation with
regional organizations such as the League
of Arab States, the Gulf Cooperation
Council and the Organisation of Islamic
Cooperation, academic institutions, the
media and the private sector. UNHCR’s
partnership strategy in the Middle East and
North Africa region follows the “whole of
society approach” under the New York
Declaration for Refugees and Migrants (see
Glossary) adopted at the United Nations
General Assembly high-level meeting in
September 2016; and focuses on
establishing robust and comprehensive
partnerships for a sustainable humanitarian
response and a greater beneficial impact on
people of concern. The strategy prioritizes
partnerships with national and local
authorities, international organizations,
international financial institutions, regional
organizations, and civil society partners,
including faith-based organizations,
academia, the private sector, media and
refugees themselves.
In Syria, UNHCR extended its partnership
network to encompass new international
and national NGOs, tripled its existing
network of community centres, established
25 mobile units to cover new locations and
emergencies, and vastly expanded the
outreach volunteer programme. The mobile
units played an important role in
disseminating information on available
services, and in identifying needs and
providing essential responses, including in
evolving situations such as in eastern
Aleppo.

REGIONAL SUMMARIES

UNHCR held consultations with over
150 stakeholders in the region with a view to
establish the Middle East and North Africa
Civil Society Network for Displacement. It
aims to amplify the voice of civil society in the
region and to further strengthen advocacy on
displacement issues, build national
non-governmental response capacities, and
share lessons learned on an array of issues,
including emergency response and
protection. Engagement with academia in
the region was also strengthened.
The first regional roundtable with academia,
including think tanks, research centers and
universities was held in April 2016 with a view
to reinforce cooperation and involvement in
displacement related matters.

Constraints
Significant challenges prevailed, as
humanitarian needs outweighed the
response capacity in 2016. Volatile security
environments and the fluid nature of
displacement made it difficult to develop
long-term sustainable responses.
Limitations on safe and unhindered
humanitarian access continued to impact
the capacity of UNHCR and its partners to
deliver assistance in insecure environments.
A lack of reliable and up-to-date data also
made delivering protection and assisting
people of concern more challenging.
Lastly, the protracted and uncertain
situation for many refugees in the region,
notably Syrians, resulted in the ongoing or
complete depletion of their financial
resources, leading to the increasing use of
negative coping strategies.

Middle East and North Africa

Financial information
The original 2016 budget for the
Middle East and North Africa region
was $2.04 billion. By the end of
2016, the revised budget for 2016
increased to $2.08 billion, mainly
because of the dire humanitarian
needs in the region, and particularly
reflecting additional requirements
for the Yemen situation and the
Regional Refugee Response Plan
(3RP) for Syrian refugees.
The region received a generous
level of earmarked funding,
amounting to $1.29 billion, including
7 per cent programme support
costs. Despite this generous level
of funding—equivalent to nearly a
third of UNHCR’s voluntary
contributions—this still left
38 per cent of the region’s needs
unmet. UNHCR used an indicative
amount of $47.7 million in
unearmarked funding to the region
to cover gaps, equivalent to
15 per cent of all unearmarked
funds used in the field.
The Middle East and North Africa
region continued to incur the
highest level of expenditure,
amounting to $1.3 billion and
representing 33 per cent of
programmed activities.

•

UNHCR GLOBAL REPORT 2016

The funding shortfall severely
affected UNHCR’s programmes
and operations in the region in
2016. The lack of funding available
made itself particularly felt in the
following areas:
•	 In Jordan, more than 50,000 of
the most vulnerable refugee men,
women and children were kept on
the cash assistance waiting list,
unable to receive monthly cash
assistance during 2016. In Iraq,
more than 16,000 families were
similarly affected due to a lack of
funds.

•	 In Iraq, where only 32 per cent
of the operational funding needs
were covered, UNHCR was unable
to help 14,000 families upgrade
substandard dwellings. In addition,
33,000 Syrian refugees were also
unable to access empowerment
opportunities.
•	 Funding shortages hampered the
provision of essential assistance
to vulnerable Sahrawi refugees
living in the five camps in Tindouf,
Algeria. While 18,000 families were
affected by floods, only 2,000 of the
most vulnerable families received
targeted shelter assistance from
UNHCR to rebuild.

•	 Prioritizing and allocating resources
•	 Ensuring organization-wide emergency, security and supply
management
•	 Ensuring financial control in accordance with United Nations
and UNHCR rules and regulations
•	 Directing organizational development and management
•	 Monitoring, measuring and reporting (including results-based
management)
•	 Oversight (inspection, evaluation, investigation and audit)
•	 Directing and supporting fundraising and resource mobilization
•	 Coordinating and directing communications and external
relations
•	 Servicing the Executive Committee and other governance
bodies, allowing them to assume their oversight functions
•	 Supporting inter-agency relations and strategic partnerships
In addition to its country and regional operations, UNHCR
undertakes a range of projects and activities of a global nature.

UNHCR GLOBAL REPORT 2016

The realities of forced displacement and
developments in 2016 underscored the need
for greater and sustained support for countries
of first asylum and intensified international
cooperation to ensure that protection and timely
solutions are available for all who need them.
However, lack of respect for human rights and
the rule of law, record levels of human mobility,
geopolitical developments, and climate change,
among other factors, exacerbated the impact of
forced displacement in many regions, and

mental Rights
UNHCR was called upon throughout the year
to exercise its protection mandate in cases
where restrictive laws, policies and practices
were adopted or tightened.
At the same time, the year saw noteworthy
progress in reinforcing respect for refugee
rights. Hosting countries and their populations
continued to demonstrate their strong
commitment to the principles of refugee
protection. Moreover, there was wider

recognition than ever that the challenges of
current refugee and mixed movements are
too onerous and complex for individual
countries to address alone. This recognition
was among the factors that led, in September
2016, to the New York Declaration for
Refugees and Migrants (see Supporting
UNHCR's work chapter and Glossary), in
which Member States of the UN unequivocally
reaffirmed and committed fully to protect the
rights of refugees and migrants.

Safeguarding Fundamental Human Rights

These clear statements of principle and
readiness to protect fundamental rights
came at a particularly important time when,
despite binding legal standards enshrined
in international, regional and national law,
major challenges persist in ensuring respect
for the international refugee protection
regime in many contexts. While the past
year presented many challenges with

respect to global forced displacement, it
also presented UNHCR with opportunities.
This chapter details the work of UNHCR
and its partners to strengthen and
systematize protection responses for the
rights of people of concern – refugees,
asylum-seekers, the stateless, and the
internally displaced.

Ensuring refugee protection
UNHCR supported
legislative
processes in more
than 40 countries
worldwide in 2016
to improve
protection standards
for refugees.

•

At the end of 2016, 17.2 million refugees
were under UNHCR’s mandate and
2.8 million people were waiting for a
decision on their application for asylum,
mostly in developed countries in which
refugee status is normally determined on an
individual basis. Nearly 130 countries now
have national asylum laws in place to
implement relevant international and
regional instruments for the protection of
refugees. Nevertheless, a significant
number of countries hosting large refugee
populations have no asylum legislation or
are not party to the 1951 Convention
Relating to the Status of Refugees and/or its
1967 Protocol.

for refugees. The Office also worked with
State asylum institutions to support and
increase the quality and efficiency of
refugee status determination (RSD)
processes, including through regional and
national quality assurance initiatives. In
addition, in the specific context of
transitioning the responsibility for RSD from
UNHCR to States, UNHCR invests in
building and strengthening the capacity of
government institutions responsible for
asylum decision-making to contribute to the
sustainability, quality and efficiency of
national RSD systems.

In exercising its supervisory responsibility
for the 1951 Convention, as well as the 1969
OAU Convention (see Glossary), UNHCR
provides official comments and expert
advice to support legislative processes
worldwide. These address a vast range of
issues, including: the criteria for eligibility
for international protection; procedural
rights and guarantees, such as access to
territory, asylum procedures, and family
unity and family reunification; security and
border management; and responsibilitysharing for examining asylum applications.

The Office also intervenes in courts to
ensure the progressive and consistent
interpretation of the 1951 Convention. In
2016, 21 formal court interventions were
filed in 15 jurisdictions, including in regional
courts such as the European Court of
Human Rights, and in national courts. In
addition, UNHCR continued to expand its
engagement with the legal community
through capacity-building initiatives for
lawyers, NGOs and judges, as well as by
developing legal tools and guidance,
funding legal service providers, and
organizing and participating in events and
conferences on international law.

In 2016, UNHCR supported legislative
processes in more than 40 countries
worldwide to improve protection standards

UNHCR also engages with UN human rights

Review (UPR), and treaty monitoring
bodies—to complement and reinforce the
protection environment for people of
concern. In 2016, the Office succeeded in
maintaining the overall inclusion rate of its
recommendations in treaty monitoring
bodies’ concluding observations at
65 per cent. Themes of relevance to
UNHCR, which were addressed in these
observations, included: non-refoulement;
reception conditions; detention; access to
quality RSD procedures; birth registration;
and statelessness.

While acknowledging the need to address
legitimate national security concerns,
UNHCR remained concerned that some
States are adopting deterrence and
border control measures, as well as
restrictive asylum laws and policies,
impacting on eligibility for international
protection, cessation of protection, limited
procedural safeguards, penalization for
irregular entry, and the right to family
unity.

Strengthen engagement with human
rights mechanisms to advocate and
enhance the protection and security
of people of concern

UNHCR worked closely with OHCHR to address global challenges with respect to forced
displacement and international protection, including through its engagement with the
Human Rights Council and Special Rapporteurs.
In the Caribbean, UNHCR used the outcomes of UN human rights mechanisms to strengthen
advocacy in relation to accession to the 1951 Convention and to further the legal basis for
protection, in the context of the Caribbean Migration Consultations and regional consultations on
the implementation of the Brazil Declaration and Plan of Action (see Glossary).
In Southern Africa, the observations of treaty monitoring bodies supported UNHCR’s
protection advocacy in the subregion, despite the diminishing field presence of the
organization in many countries.

Fair protection processes
Access to and quality of status determination procedures improved
Engagement with RSD was strengthened in field operations, including when identifying the
place of RSD in the broader protection strategy, the use of efficient processing modalities
while maintaining fairness and quality, and, where relevant, on transitioning the responsibility
for RSD from UNHCR to States.

Country-specific guidance, including eligibility guidelines, protection considerations, and
non-return advisories, was published on Afghanistan, El Salvador, Honduras, Hungary, Iraq,
Nigeria and Somalia.
Legal, procedural and operational guidance on RSD eligibility standards and procedures
were provided to field operations, governments and other stakeholders.
Guidance was provided to UNHCR operations and governments on addressing security
concerns without undermining refugee protection within RSD procedures, especially in the
areas of exclusion, cancellation, extradition and matters relating to the civilian and
humanitarian character of asylum.

KEY ACHIEVEMENTS IN 2016
A new interview learning programme (ILP) for UNHCR personnel involved in interviewing,
primarily for the purposes of RSD, resettlement and other protection-related activities, was
finalized and delivered as a pilot ILP training of trainers for 14 UNHCR personnel who will
facilitate the ILP in the future. An in-country ILP was also conducted for 35 RSD eligibility
officers, reviewers and supervisors in Kenya.
Country of origin information (COI) training was provided to UNHCR RSD personnel,
including through the newly-developed COI e-learning course.
Mandate RSD operations were supported through the deployment of 7 RSD experts.
RSD-specific training, including 3 sessions of the RSD learning programme, benefited some
90 UNHCR personnel working in areas such as registration, RSD and resettlement.

Provide decision-makers on asylum
claims with access to up-to-date COI

In response to identified information gaps, COI on important countries of origin was
collected and published.
Refworld, UNHCR’s repository for country information, as well as legal and policy
documents, was maintained and its content further expanded and updated.

Registration and identity management
Knowing and understanding the identities of
people of its concern is central to UNHCR’s
work. Re-establishing and preserving
identities is key to ensuring protection and
solutions for refugees. Identity data assists
the organization in promoting access to
rights and facilitating protection and durable
solutions. Identity management tools and
processes also improve the integrity of
UNHCR’s interventions by diminishing the
possibility of fraud, duplicative assistance,
identity substitution or multiple registration.
Identity management provides accurate
population figures to inform planning and
allows the organization to build detailed
knowledge of people of concern to provide
adequate and appropriate support over the
course of—in many cases—years or
decades.
In 2016, UNHCR undertook 19 registration
verification exercises and deployed experts
to support large-scale registration exercises
in Cameroon, Kenya and Niger, as well as for
emergency registration in Ethiopia, Greece

and Uganda. An important update to
UNHCR’s registration and case management
tool, proGres in Partnership, was released in
August 2016 and is in use across
15 operations by UNHCR, partners and host
governments to standardize registration and
case management practices.
UNHCR continued to strengthen its identity
management capability in 2016 through
the ongoing development and deployment
of biometric tools. Its two primary biometric
systems, the “biometric identity
management system” (BIMS) and IrisGuard,
maintained more than 3.2 million biometric
enrolments globally by the end of 2016.
Among other applications, these systems
allow UNHCR and partners to verify
identities at distribution points, ensuring a
faster and more secure aid distribution
process, and enabling refugees to access
cardless ATM transactions and purchases
at certain points of sale. BIMS is currently
deployed to 24 country operations
globally, while IrisGuard is operational in

the Middle East and North Africa region.
UNHCR is committed to expanding its
biometrics capability to 75 countries by
2020.
Together with governments and key
humanitarian actors, UNHCR explored
opportunities for strategic data sharing and
interoperability of systems, guided by the

|

T H E M AT I C C H A P T E R S

"Policy on the protection of personal data of
persons of concern to UNHCR."
Recognizing the sensitivity of biometric
data, the Office continued developing
guidance and tools to ensure consistency in
the collection, storage and use of this data,
both internally and externally, while
ensuring a high level of data security and
data protection for people of concern.

Protection in the context of mixed movements
Refugees and migrants regularly use the
same routes and means to reach their
destination. If unable to enter a State legally,
they may find other ways, such as having
recourse to smugglers or embarking on
dangerous sea or land voyages. These
avenues heighten their exposure to risks
such as trafficking, torture, violence, sexual
and gender-based violence, and other
human rights abuses. As an indication of
these dangers, in 2016 more than
5,000 people died or went missing at sea in
the Mediterranean.
To help States address mixed movements in
a protection-sensitive way, UNHCR updated
its “10-point plan in action on refugee
protection and mixed migration,” which
contains more than 100 practical tools and
examples of good practices, to assist States
and other actors in managing complex mixed
movements. Specific interventions also
supported the development of regional
approaches to respond to irregular mixed

movements, such as collaboration with the
Regional Mixed Migration Secretariat and the
Mixed Migration Monitoring Initiative.
UNHCR continued working with
stakeholders to enhance their
understanding of the imperative of
refugee protection in the context of mixed
movements, and to promote
protection-sensitive migration systems that
facilitate access to asylum and protection.
UNHCR participated in key global forums
on international migration, including the
Global Migration Group and the Global
Forum on Migration and Development, and
continued to collaborate on multilateral
and bilateral bases with IOM, OHCHR,
UNODC and ILO, as well as with NGO
partners. Specific initiatives to address
trafficking in human beings were
undertaken in collaboration with IOM and
under the framework of the Inter-Agency
Coordination Group against Trafficking in
Persons.

Safeguarding Fundamental Human Rights

Beyond detention
UNHCR’s goal is to end the routine
detention of asylum-seekers, refugees and
other people under its protection mandate.
The Office remained concerned about the
systematic detention of asylum-seekers in
some contexts, given such detention is
often prolonged and in conditions falling
short of international standards.
The routine detention of asylum-seekers
and migrants represents a growing human
rights challenge. UNHCR’s many years of
work and research on this issue confirm
that detaining asylum-seekers and refugees
is harmful, costly and, importantly, less
effective than alternative measures. It has
devastating consequences for individuals,
as well as their families and communities,
and incurs considerable costs for States.
There are many alternative ways for
governments to manage their asylum
and migration systems which remain
under-utilized.
The Office’s “Global strategy – beyond
detention” (2014-2019) has three primary
goals: ending child detention; ensuring
alternatives to detention are available in law
and implemented in practice; and ensuring

detention conditions meet international
standards. In partnership with States and
civil society organizations, the strategy has
been rolled out in 19 focus countries,
namely Belgium, Botswana, Bulgaria,
Canada, Czechia, Hungary, Indonesia,
Israel, Lithuania, Malaysia, Malta, Mexico,
South Africa, Thailand, the former Yugoslav
Republic of Macedonia, the United Kingdom
of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the
United States of America, Zambia and
Zimbabwe.
In 2016, the progress made and
achievements in implementing the global
strategy were consolidated in two reports, a
baseline report and a progress report,
based on information gathered by UNHCR
in the focus countries and informed by
regular dialogue with stakeholders. The
compilations are intended to guide
decision-makers and practitioners in
identifying and remedying any
shortcomings in national frameworks
pertaining to detention, as well as to
support policy design. Additional
information and progress on the
implementation of the global strategy can
be found at www.unhcr.org/detention.

Implementation of UNHCR’s “Global strategy – beyond detention” (2014-2019) has
resulted in:

•

14% decrease in the number of
children detained in the focus
countries.

4 countries passing new legislation
eliminating the detention of children
for immigration-related reasons.

22% increase in detention monitoring
activities in the focus countries.

5 countries implementing measures
offering alternatives to detention.

The Elsanis, a Roma
family from Kosovo
who live in
Montenegro, recently
obtained identity
documents and are
no longer at risk of
statelessness.

Ending statelessness
Stateless people are not considered as
nationals by any State under the
operation of its law. Statelessness is
estimated to have affected at least
10 million people in 2016. However, data
captured by governments and
communicated to UNHCR were limited to
3.2 million stateless individuals in
74 countries.
In line with UNHCR’s #IBelong Campaign
to End Statelessness by 2024, notable
progress was made in 2016 in raising
awareness of the plight of stateless
people and achieving concrete outcomes
to prevent and resolve statelessness.
Three States—Guinea-Bissau, Mali and
Sierra Leone—acceded to both
statelessness conventions, bringing the
number of States party to the 1954
Convention and the 1961 Convention to
89 and 68, respectively.
A reported 60,800 stateless people
acquired nationality or had it confirmed
during 2016. Many countries are taking
important steps to grant nationality to
stateless people. For example, the
Government of Kenya is in the process of

issuing citizenship documentation to the
Makonde people, an ethnic minority group
present but stateless on the territory for
generations, after officially recognizing the
Makonde as the country’s 43rd ethnicity.
A tripartite registration exercise by UNHCR
and the Governments of Indonesia and the
Philippines enabled more than
4,000 people of Indonesian descent in the
Philippines to confirm Filipino and/or
Indonesian nationality, bringing the total
number of stateless cases resolved through
this project to more than 8,700.

At least 60,800
stateless people
acquired nationality
or had it confirmed.
Guinea-Bissau, Mali
and Sierra Leone
acceded to both
statelessness
conventions in 2016.

In Thailand, new laws expanded the scope
of eligibility for stateless people to apply for
nationality, a policy from which up to
80,000 children are expected to benefit. In
Côte d’Ivoire, an estimated 6,000 stateless
people acquired Ivorian nationality in 2016
through the Government’s “acquisition of
nationality by declaration” procedure, with
many thousands of applications still
pending.
National reforms in 2016 also helped to
advance the prevention of statelessness.
The Government of Norway issued a new

immigration policy in October 2016,
permitting all stateless children born in
Norway to apply for and acquire Norwegian
citizenship. UNHCR and civil society
partners supported Madagascar in
amending its nationality law to allow women
to transmit nationality to their children on an
equal basis to men. Nevertheless,
26 countries worldwide still maintained
gender discrimination in nationality laws
and UNHCR continues to support
governments in their efforts to eliminate this
form of discrimination.
The Office also continued supporting
governments in establishing or improving
statelessness determination procedures.
Notable developments in this regard were
in the Americas, where both Brazil and
Ecuador passed new legislation in 2016
giving stateless people temporary legal
residence, enabling the establishment of a
statelessness determination procedure, and
facilitating the naturalization of stateless
people.
In 2016, UNHCR strengthened its
partnerships to address statelessness. With
UNICEF, the Office launched a new coalition
to “Ensure every child’s right to a
nationality,” with the support of a diverse

128

•

UNHCR GLOBAL REPORT 2016

group of NGOs. From 2017, the coalition will
implement joint strategies in a number of
priority countries. UNHCR worked closely
with the World Bank on its “ID4D Initiative”
to ensure people of concern are included in
national efforts to improve access to legal
identity, including birth registration, in line
with target 16.9 of the Sustainable
Development Goals (SDGs).
The States in the “Friends of the campaign
to end statelessness” group undertook
several diplomatic initiatives in 2016,
including the introduction of a resolution on
“The right to a nationality: women’s equal
nationality rights in law and practice,” which
was adopted by the Human Rights Council.
Thanks largely to the coordinated efforts of
States and civil society, more than
70 statelessness-related recommendations
were made during States’ UPR taking place
in 2016.
Notwithstanding these positive
developments, more needs to be done to
accelerate achievement of the #IBelong
Campaign’s goals. As the first official
“milestone year,” when progress will be
measured against each of the 10 actions in
the global action plan to end statelessness,
2017 will be a critical year.

end statelessness: 2014-2024.”
In the Plurinational State of Bolivia, the Government adopted a resolution in March 2016 to
facilitate the naturalization of refugees and stateless individuals. The resolution removed the
requirement of a minimum period of residence and significantly reduced fees.
In Costa Rica, a statelessness determination procedure was established in April 2016 and
came into effect in October 2016.
In Greece, new asylum legislation was adopted in April 2016 that granted the asylum
authority the competence to apply the 1954 Convention. A presidential decree was
expected to outline the procedures for determining the status of stateless people.
At least 8 States were supported to introduce gender equality into their nationality law,
including Liberia and Madagascar.

International and regional instruments acceded to, ratified or strengthened
There were 6 accessions to the statelessness conventions in 2016; Guinea-Bissau, Mali and
Sierra Leone acceded to both conventions.
The draft African Union Protocol on the Right to Nationality in Africa was submitted to the
Special Technical Committees of the African Union for review.

Promote accession to the 1954
Convention Relating to the Status of
Stateless Persons and the 1961

The Southern African Development Community (SADC) adopted a resolution that calls on
SADC Governments to take the necessary steps to accede to the 1954 and 1961 Conventions,
and to review and reform domestic provisions on nationality, where necessary.
In the Middle East and North Africa, the League of Arab States and UNHCR jointly drafted
recommendations that would support universal birth registration, enhance the capacity of
civil registration and vital statistics systems, and further align nationality laws in the region
with international standards.
A new civil society network, the Statelessness Network Asia Pacific, was launched in
November 2016 to complement existing regional networks in the Americas, Europe and
elsewhere. The network aims to build and strengthen cooperation and capacity among
40-plus civil society actors to end statelessness across the region.

Addressing internal displacement
Since 2011, conflict and violence have
driven up the numbers of people internally
displaced. A key objective for UNHCR is
supporting States, in partnership with the
special rapporteur on the human rights of
IDPs and other key stakeholders, to
develop and implement legal and
institutional frameworks to prevent, respond
to, and facilitate solutions for IDPs.
In 2016, UNHCR issued operational
guidelines for its engagement in situations
of internal displacement, as part of a
coordinated response. The Office also
published an “Internal note on humanitarian
evacuations in violence and armed conflict.”
Building on pre-existing guidance, as well
as drawing from the lessons learned and
tools developed by UNHCR and its
partners, the note sets out key protection
and operational considerations, including
minimum standards, for in-country
humanitarian evacuations in situations of
armed violence and conflict where

individuals or groups face an immediate
threat to life.
UNHCR’s action on behalf of IDPs in conflict
situations remains centred on the interagency cluster leadership approach.
Through its leadership role in the Global
Protection, Shelter and Camp Coordination
and Camp Management (CCCM) Clusters,
the organization provides global interagency policy advice and guidance, supports
country-level clusters, and builds additional
capacity at global and country levels.
UNHCR is the Global Cluster lead agency
for protection. In 2016, the Global
Protection Cluster (GPC) provided
support and guidance to 35 protection
clusters and cluster-like mechanisms, of
which 25 were led or co-led by UNHCR.
Protection policy developed by the GPC
was adopted by the Inter-Agency
Standing Committee. The GPC also issued
guidance to Humanitarian Country Teams

-----------------------Page 132 End-----------------------

Safeguarding Fundamental Human Rights

on the development of protection
strategies and published a review of
actions taken in 2016 to strengthen the
centrality of protection, including a
collation of good practices. UNHCR and
the special rapporteur on the human
rights of IDPs co-led the GPC task team
on law and policy and created a database
on national and regional IDP laws and
policies.
The Global Shelter Cluster (GSC) is co-led
by UNHCR in conflict situations and IFRC
in natural disasters. It supported
26 country-level clusters or cluster-like
mechanisms in 2016, of which 12 were led
by UNHCR. The organization provided
coordination services to some 380 partners
who provided 9 million people with shelter
or non-food items.
The GSC continued to work towards the
objectives of the "Global Shelter Cluster
strategy" (2013-2017). GSC staff undertook
missions to support country-level clusters
and ensure predictable and consistent
cluster coordination until longer-term expert
capacity was in place. In 2016, the GSC
expanded the pool of qualified cluster
coordinators able to provide surge capacity
through capacity-building and training
initiatives.

developed tools and technical guidance,
strengthened information management
systems, and provided capacity building.
Population data management, and data
collection and analysis, are at the core of
the cluster’s work, and the Global CCCM
Cluster encourages strong partnerships
with national actors and governments.
In 2016, UNHCR led or co-led
10 country-level clusters in the Central
African Republic, Chad, the Democratic
Republic of the Congo, Iraq, Myanmar,
Nigeria, Pakistan, South Sudan, Turkey
under the framework of cross-border
assistance to the Syrian Arab Republic
(Syria), and Yemen. To improve its
governance structure, the Global CCCM
Cluster established a strategic advisory
group with ACTED, Danish Refugee Council,
Lutheran World Federation and Norwegian
Refugee Council participation. A five-year
strategy for the cluster was also finalized.
To strengthen the capacity of camp
managers and other humanitarian actors in
the field, the Global CCCM Cluster
developed an e-learning programme on
camp management that was piloted in
selected operations at the end of 2016.
A methodology for systematically
monitoring sites was also developed and
implemented in a number of operations to
capture essential information about
displaced communities, with a view to
monitoring, analysing and informing
humanitarian responses.

Their father died late last year from a
snake bite while farming his fields at
home. The Lord’s Resistance Army, a militia
that terrorizes swathes of the region,
kidnapped their mother three years earlier.
Here in Bambouti, they were lucky to
come across Jules Sabu, an old friend of
their parents, who has taken them into his
meagre refugee shelter and is looking after
them alongside his own seven children.
“In South Sudan, we were helped by
priests who sent us to school and provided
us with tricycles,” says Seto, clearly upset
at the memory of the specially-adapted
wheelchairs he used to move around.
“I wish I could go back to school.”
The last functioning school here in
Bambouti was destroyed in CAR’s own
internal conflict in 2002. Similarly, there
are no doctors or health facilities, no
major markets, very little drinkable water,
almost no government or humanitarian
agency representation, and no tricycles
for the twins.

“Armed people attacked our village
in Source Yubu in November. We fled
and spent several days on the road,
and finally arrived here, where a
family friend took us in,” says Semo.
The brothers ended up in Bambouti, a
small collection of villages in eastern
CAR that is today home to more than
10,000 South Sudanese refugees.

The original population here was perhaps
950 people. The community’s ten-fold
increase since the refugees arrived has
seriously strained local resources, and
vulnerable children like Semo and Seto are
the worst affected.
“The presence of several unaccompanied
minors among the refugees in Bambouti is
a big concern,” says Lazare Kouassi Etien,
who heads UNHCR in CAR.
“Starting in mid-June, we will carry out
a fuller registration of these refugees,
while also identifying host families in the
community in Bambouti who can provide
a home for them. We will set up avenues
for reunification with their family members
as soon as the security situation in South
Sudan improves.”
South Sudan’s main civil war erupted in
December 2013 and ended with a peace
deal in August 2015. But a series of
smaller-scale conflicts continue, like the
one in Western Equatoria that the refugees
at Bambouti ran from.
During a recent rapid assessment mission
in Bambouti in May, UNCHR staff spoke to
10 unaccompanied or vulnerable children
among the refugee population. Many more

may be found when the wider registration
exercise is completed in June.
Brothers Wenya, 10, and Essem, 12,
became separated from their four older
siblings as they fled fighting in November
near Source Yubu, where they lived in
South Sudan. Their parents have both died.
In Bambouti they are being looked after
by their aunt, Antunta. “We have received
some basic household items like blankets
and pots from UNHCR, and spades so that
we can start cultivating crops to feed the
children,” she said. “They can no longer
go to school and this is a real concern for
them.”
Humanitarian agencies face extreme
difficulties raising funds to meet even the
basic needs of water, food, shelter, and
emergency medical care for the 2.4 million
South Sudanese displaced by the conflict.
But despite struggling daily for food and
clean water and living in a makeshift
shelter, Susan Aminisa, 10, whose
parents died in fighting in Source Yubu in
November, says her priority remains her
schooling. “I wish we could pursue our
education so that in future we can take
care of ourselves,” she says. “I would like
to become a teacher so that I can teach
other unfortunate children.”

UNHCR GLOBAL REPORT 2016

Complex, protracted situations and recurrent
conflict continued to cause internal and crossborder displacement throughout 2016. The
Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC)
system-wide Level 3 emergency declarations for
Iraq, the Syrian Arab Republic (Syria) and Yemen
remained in effect, as did six UNHCR
emergency declarations for inside Yemen, as
well as for the Burundi, Iraq, Nigeria, South
Sudan and Syria situations.

Lifesaving Support
By the end of the year, more than 20 UNHCR
country operations were responding to
large-scale refugee and internal
displacement. The Office also deactivated
six emergency declarations during 2016 for
the Central African Republic (CAR), Myanmar,
Uganda (for refugees from the Democratic
Republic of the Congo only), Ukraine,
Djibouti and Somalia as part of the Yemen
situation, and the Europe situation.

In addition to enhancing emergency
preparedness, UNHCR provided skilled staff
and material support to protect and assist
people of concern, as well as strengthen
operational delivery and coordination in
countries experiencing new or deteriorating
situations of displacement.

$680 million in 2016, complementing a
broad range of interventions made by the
Office in sectors such as shelter and
health, to meet the basic needs of people
of concern.

benefited from
emergency
preparedness
and response
training in 2016.

UNHCR’s approach to emergency
preparedness is grounded in robust risk
assessments; collaborative and localized
planning; and the rights, dignity and
protection needs of people of concern. The
Office worked with its partners and other
stakeholders to ensure that effective
preparedness measures: were in place
across each sector; built upon the existing
response and capacities; maintained and
reinforced the centrality of protection; and
integrated and addressed cross-cutting
issues through quality programming.
UNHCR introduced the high alert list for
emergency preparedness (HALEP) as a key
diagnostic tool for early warning,
monitoring of current and potential
displacement risks, and assessing the
readiness and response capacity of the
organization. More than 40 country
operations used the HALEP to assess risk
and develop contingency plans.

The Office continued to provide training,
guidance and tools to increase
preparedness and enhance local response
capacity. More than 1,800 staff, partners and
other stakeholders benefited from
emergency preparedness and response
training. In addition, a dedicated team was
established at Headquarters to provide
guidance and support to field operations in
countries at high risk of experiencing new
or deteriorating situations of displacement.
Supply readiness was strengthened through
the pre-positioning of relief items closer to
“hot spot” areas, as well as by increasing
logistics capacity, to respond to operational
needs more rapidly. UNHCR also actively
engaged in the “Ready to respond” initiative,
working alongside DFID, OCHA, UNICEF and
WFP to improve emergency response
capacities, advance inter-agency coherence
in humanitarian action, and yield efficiencies
in the longer term.

Emergency response
The rapid deployment of skilled staff plays a
critical role in UNHCR’s initial emergency
response. More than 370 deployments were
undertaken in 2016 to support 31 country
operations, including Uganda in response to
a refugee influx from South Sudan, as well as
Greece, Iraq, Niger and Nigeria. The Office
maintained internal multi-functional standby
teams, led by senior emergency
coordinators, and new functional rosters
were created for human resources, supply
and programme. In addition, UNHCR’s
standby partners provided expert surge
personnel to emergency operations,
expanding humanitarian outreach and
further strengthening coordination. More
than 40 per cent of emergency deployments
in 2016 were facilitated by standby
partnerships.

Emergency classifications
Level 3 – an IASC system-wide Level 3 (L3)
emergency is the global humanitarian system’s
classification for the most severe crises. They
require system-wide mobilization to significantly
increase the scope of the response and improve
the overall effectiveness of assistance. A systemwide L3 emergency is declared by the Emergency
Relief Coordinator on behalf of the IASC, of which
UNHCR is an active member.
UNHCR classifications – the organization defines
three levels of emergency response.
Considerations in assessing the level of an
emergency include the impact on affected
populations, the complexity of the situation, and
the capacity of the Office to respond. A UNHCR
emergency declaration triggers an immediate
mobilization of financial, human and material
resources to support the country office in
responding to the crisis.

KEY ACHIEVEMENTS IN 2016

INTERVENTION IN 2016

Emergency preparedness and response
Emergency response capacity and effectiveness reinforced
A dedicated unit was established at Headquarters to provide guidance and support to
operations, and develop analytical tools. More than 20 countries were supported in 2016,
including Afghanistan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), and operations affected
by the Burundi, Nigeria and South Sudan situations.
The HALEP and its accompanying diagnostic tools were introduced and assisted
43 operations to assess preparedness.

Enhance emergency preparedness

Refugee emergency response agreements with NGOs were expanded to include response
capacity in SGBV; health; water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH); cash-based interventions;
and nutrition; in addition to existing agreements for camp coordination and camp
management; shelter; community-based protection; and education.
UNHCR, in consultation with the Government and other partners, identified priorities for a
joint approach on emergency preparedness, which was rolled out in the United Republic of
Tanzania. The approach focuses on mapping and complementing local capacity; analysis
and planning; protection-centred preparedness; and capacity building.

Deploy standby emergency
coordination, preparedness and
response teams

More than 370 deployments and missions were undertaken to support emergency
operations, including 40% from stand-by partners.
UNHCR emergency stand-by teams worked to strengthen protection, operational delivery,
and coordination in 15 operations. New technical rosters for human resources, supply and
programme capacity were established.
The Emergency Handbook (accessible online at https://emergency.unhcr.org/ and as a
mobile application) was updated to reflect new policies, guidance and tools.

Build capacity in emergency
preparedness and response, security
and supply chain management

More than 1,200 UNHCR and external participants were trained in emergency preparedness
and response; more than 1,500 participants were trained in security management; and some
900 participants were trained in supply chain management.
The eCentre in Bangkok facilitated 22 capacity-building activities for more than
600 practitioners from the Asia and Pacific region.
Security risk management measures were reviewed and adapted to protect and assist
people of concern in conflict and high-risk environments.

Reinforce security management as
an organizational culture

Security analysis was integrated into emergency preparedness and response plans, as well
as business continuity plans.
Operations were assessed through the annual minimum operating security standards
(MOSS) survey to ensure appropriate risk mitigation measures are in place.
Security structures and equipment were maintained to meet appropriate standards and
operational needs.

Addressing sexual and gender-based violence
Sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV)
is a human rights violation with devastating
consequences. Vulnerability to SGBV is
exacerbated in displacement settings, and
proven measures should be taken from the
start of humanitarian responses to
comprehensively address risks and protect
affected populations.
UNHCR prioritizes the prevention of, and
response to, SGBV, in particular in
emergencies. Through an SGBV specialist
deployment scheme, funded by the “Safe
from the start” initiative, 10 country operations
(CAR, Greece, Italy, Malawi, Niger, Nigeria,
Rwanda, South Sudan, Uganda and the
United Republic of Tanzania) received
55 months of dedicated technical support in
2016. This additional support increased both
the efficiency and coverage of SGBV
programming, including through the
establishment of referral pathways to connect
survivors with appropriate service providers.
The additional expertise also strengthened
the capacity of UNHCR staff, partners and
government authorities to better identify and
mitigate the risks of SGBV, as well as assist
survivors and those at risk.
UNHCR continued to focus on
strengthening measures to identify SGBV
survivors as early as possible and ensure
they receive timely and appropriate
assistance. In Cameroon, 13 communitybased committees have been established in
neighbourhoods with large concentrations
of urban refugees to facilitate the early
identification of SGBV survivors and the
timely referral to government-run services.
In Jordan, UNHCR scaled up the provision
of legal aid to SGBV survivors through the

deployment of specialized lawyers in
women and girls’ safe spaces in refugee
camps. This contributed to an increase in
the use of legal services to address SGBV.
In the United Republic of Tanzania, medical
staff worked to improve health and
protection screening at border entry points
to identify survivors and accelerate their
referral to health services and psychosocial
counselling.
Throughout the year, UNHCR continued to
develop innovative, multi-sectoral
approaches to SGBV prevention and
response that could be replicated in
different operations. Projects in 13 countries
have been designed to prevent specific
SGBV risks affecting the community in
sectors such as energy, livelihoods, and
information and technology. Some
examples of these are presented below.
To help reduce the SGBV risks associated
with collecting firewood, UNHCR is trialling
projects that provide refugee communities
with access to alternative energy sources. In
Cameroon, a project provided the community
with an alternative energy source to firewood
by engaging 30 refugee women to collect
biomass, and make and sell briquettes. In
Kigeme camp, Rwanda, UNHCR partnered
with a local social enterprise to provide
300 households with low-emission cooking
stoves and biomass pellets, as an alternative
to firewood. In Nyarugusu camp in the United
Republic of Tanzania, the Community
Environmental Management and
Development Organization distributed gas
and cooking stoves to 3,000 households for
an initial 12-week period. Protection outcomes
of the project will be assessed in early 2017.

Responding with Lifesaving Support

A lack of livelihood opportunities and
support for displaced people are high-risk
factors for SGBV. Women and girls excluded
from livelihood opportunities, for example,
can be exposed to sexual exploitation and
abuse because of their precarious
economic situations. In Malaysia, an artisan
project provided sewing, embroidery and
knitting training to support refugees in
selling their products online and in local
bazaars, with revenue from sales invested
back into the provision of services for SGBV
survivors. In the Republic of the Congo
(Congo), a social support network for young
women and girls developed an outreach
and training programme to reduce the risk
of sexual exploitation. Literacy, life skills,
and vocational training were provided to

facilitate job placements for the
participants.
Innovative approaches using information
and technology solutions to empower
those at risk are a key component of
UNHCR’s approach to SGBV prevention
and response. A community technology
access project established a women-only
internet café in Herat, Afghanistan, for
refugee returnees, IDPs and the local
community. Run by a local women’s
association, the café allows women to
access information or report SGBV
incidents in a safe environment. For
survivors, the café also provides
counselling services and referrals for
additional support.

Cash assistance for protection
UNHCR continues to lead on efforts to assure
the protection of people of concern through
cash assistance. Research by UNHCR and its
partners has shown that cash, particularly
unrestricted multi-purpose grants, can help
mitigate the vulnerability of refugees and
IDPs to negative coping strategies, such as
survival sex and child labour.
Protection-oriented cash interventions were
in place in more than 30 field operations
during 2016. Cash assistance was, for
example, provided as part of case
management for urgent or monthly needs in
Jordan and Syria; to assist people with
specific needs in Kenya, Morocco and
Tunisia; to cover subsistence expenses for
unaccompanied children in Ethiopia, Sudan

and Yemen; to meet protection and mixed
solutions needs in India; to support survivors
and those at risk of SGBV in the Congo,
alongside other forms of assistance, such as
counselling and livelihood support; and as
part of governmental safety net programmes
in Ukraine and Zambia.
UNHCR also continued to build its
knowledge base, capacity and systems to
implement CBIs as a protection tool.
Technical support on cash and protection
was provided to 11 country operations,
including Afghanistan, CAR, the DRC, Syria,
Turkey and the United Republic of Tanzania.
Specific training on cash and child protection
was undertaken in Egypt, Ethiopia, Sudan
and Yemen.

reaching 2.5 million vulnerable refugees,
asylum-seekers, stateless people and IDPs in
more than 60 operations worldwide. This
included some two million vulnerable people
in the Middle East and North Africa region,
who received some $355 million in cash
assistance. Post-distribution monitoring found
that cash assistance helped prevent Syrian
refugees from resorting to negative coping
strategies, such as child labour. In Jordan,

Existing data indicates a clear preference
among populations of concern for cash over
other forms of assistance. In line with its Grand
Bargain commitment to double the use of cash
as a proportion of its assistance by 2020,
UNHCR’s cash-based programming reached a
value of $688 million in 2016 – a 106 per cent
increase from $325 million in 2015. Building on
three decades of experience in multi-sectoral
assistance and CBIs, UNHCR uses cash for a
wide range of purposes, including protection,
basic needs, education, shelter, health,
livelihood activities, and protection against
winter conditions. Multi-purpose cash grants
continue to constitute the bulk of UNHCR’s
cash assistance.

well-being. More than half of the
respondents stated that it helped to pay
rent and a quarter felt that the quality of
their housing was improved.
The efficiency gains from using CBIs were
also prominent. A joint study by UNHCR and
PricewaterhouseCoopers of UNHCR’s three
largest, established cash operations in 2016
(Afghanistan, Jordan and Lebanon)
confirmed that up to 93 cents of each dollar
went to people of concern. The review
suggests between 88-93 per cent of the
total CBI expenditure reached the
beneficiary, while recognizing that the cost
of delivering cash assistance will vary
depending on the size and maturity of cash
programmes.
UNHCR launched its “Policy on cash-based
interventions” in 2016 and began
implementing its “Strategy for the
institutionalization of cash-based
interventions in UNHCR” (2016–2020).
These frameworks ensure the Office has
the necessary policies, procedures,
guidance and systems in place to
effectively and efficiently implement cash
assistance where appropriate, at scale and
with accountability.
As part of its strategy, the Office worked to
significantly scale-up its capacity to assess,

design, implement and monitor cash
programmes. Some 700 staff received
training on CBIs and two cash-specific
capacity-building programmes were
launched. In addition, UNHCR expanded
dedicated CBI capacity in numerous field
operations, including Afghanistan,
Cameroon, the Congo, the DRC, Ghana,
Malawi, Mozambique, Myanmar, Rwanda,
Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe.
UNHCR is pursuing open and collaborative
engagement on cash assistance and,
together with WFP and UNICEF, has
committed to working with a full range of
partners. A priority was to continue
working with host governments to include
refugees in existing social protection and
safety net delivery systems, whenever
possible.
The Office continues to pioneer and
promote approaches to cash transfer
arrangements that provide equal, direct and
shared access to all humanitarian actors. In
2016, UNHCR pioneered this approach
through the common cash facility in Jordan,
which allows all response partners to
transfer cash through the same banking
arrangements and share the efficiency
gains generated by collective volume. This
significantly decreased bank fees for
partners.

Meeting basic needs
Shelter and settlements
UNHCR
provided shelter
assistance to
more than
1.2 million
people in 2016.

Providing access to safe and adequate
shelter remains critical to ensuring the
protection of people of concern. UNHCR’s
“Global strategy for settlement and shelter”
(2014-2018) continues to provide a
framework for operations to pursue more
effective and comprehensive responses,
from emergency shelter interventions to
more sustainable and durable shelter and
settlement solutions.
Throughout 2016, efforts were focused on
four overarching themes: operational
support; capacity building; research and
development; and partnership and
coordination.
UNHCR continues to invest in research and
development to find affordable shelter
options that maximize protection, safety
and dignity for refugees. In 2016, a new
self-standing tent was designed with IFRC,
which will become available in 2017.

148

•

UNHCR GLOBAL REPORT 2016

The new model can be locked and divided
into two separate rooms for increased
safety and privacy, and significantly
improves the living environment for people
of concern at the same cost as the existing
UNHCR family tent. On average, UNHCR
distributes 70,000-100,000 tents each year.
In recognition of the inherent links between
shelter and the environment, livelihoods
and public health, UNHCR continues to
advocate the Master Plan approach (see
Glossary) for refugee settlements. In 2016,
three operations (Chad, Nepal and Uganda)
began piloting the approach, in addition to
ongoing efforts in Kenya and Mozambique.
UNHCR also implemented technical
trainings and developed resources and
tools, such as the physical planning toolkit,
shelter design catalogue, site assessment
form, settlement folio and e-learning
programme to strengthen the coherence
and effectiveness of its settlement and
shelter responses.

camp, Jordan.

Public health
UNHCR uses its health information system,
Twine, to monitor the health status of
refugees and the coverage and quality of
interventions for some 3.2 million people of
concern in 26 countries. Trend analysis of
key health indicators contributed to timely
and appropriate life-saving responses in
camps and host communities.
Where possible, UNHCR and partners
pursue a systematic approach to disease
control, which includes preparedness and
response to outbreaks through community
awareness, early detection, efficient case
management, and cross-sectoral prevention
activities. Effective monitoring and strong
technical support helped government
authorities, UNHCR and other partners to
manage cholera outbreaks in Kenya and
Uganda. In response to a yellow fever
outbreak in East Africa, UNHCR procured
more than 26,000 vaccines and ensured
refugees were included in national yellow
fever outbreak prevention in Kenya, Rwanda
and the United Republic of Tanzania.

UNHCR believes working through and
supporting national health systems benefit
refugees as well as host communities and
governments. The Office advocates the
inclusion of refugees in national health-care
systems and is rolling out multi-year plans to
facilitate access to national health insurance
schemes and systems in countries such as
Benin, Burkina Faso, Djibouti, Rwanda,
Senegal and Togo. In 2016, a three-year plan
to transfer management of refugee health
clinics in Ghana to the Government was
successfully completed, while the integration
of one million Afghan and Iraqi refugees into
the national health insurance scheme in the
Islamic Republic of Iran is ongoing.

7.4 million
refugees
benefitted from
health services
supported by
UNHCR in 2016.

Addressing mental health needs and
providing psychosocial support are priority
areas for UNHCR. Significant progress was
made to integrate mental health response
into primary health-care programmes in
sub-Saharan Africa, with 460 health workers
trained jointly by UNHCR and WHO in 2016.
The training increased refugees’ access to

Responding with Lifesaving Support

essential mental health care in under-served
communities by enabling clinical staff
working in primary health care to manage
common mental health problems.
Proper sanitation is the foundation for
favourable health conditions. In 2016, UNHCR
made significant progress in improving
access to safe water and sanitation to meet
emergency needs, as well as its longer-term
goals of maximizing cost-effectiveness and
minimizing environmental impact. Globally,
household latrine coverage in refugee
settings increased from 27 per cent to
36 per cent in 2016, with the remaining
refugees continuing to rely on communal
latrines.

The installation of efficient and inclusive
WASH systems requires significant
upfront investment. However, analysis of
the use of innovative solutions has shown
cost savings of 80 per cent for boreholes
powered by solar energy, established in
the Bidibidi settlement and Rhino camp in
Uganda. Cost savings of 50 per cent were
also evident for boreholes powered by
solar-hybrid systems in the Dadaab
refugee camps in Kenya, and in Nyarugusu
camp and Nduta camps in the United
Republic of Tanzania. The water-efficient
latrines in Mahama camp in Rwanda only
use 0.5 litres of water per flush, while the
urine-diverting dry toilets in Ethiopia’s
Dollo Ado and Gambella camps reduce
waste volumes by up to 90 per cent.

Cash assistance for basic needs
In Ukraine, the UNHCR-led shelter and NFI
cluster used cash assistance to enable IDPs
to afford rent, heating and utilities, as well as
fuel and clothing for winter. The response
also included vouchers and cash for shelter
repair, accompanied by technical support for
land tenure considerations and engineering
expertise. Post-distribution monitoring
surveys of the multi-sectoral cash assistance
found that IDPs prioritized rent, utilities,
clothes, heating and core relief items, with
variations according to geographical zones
and times of the year. The cluster also
released guidance on monetizing assistance,
with a focus on monitoring protection risks
and taking into consideration the social
protection system in place in Ukraine.

150

•

UNHCR GLOBAL REPORT 2016

In Jordan, UNHCR is providing cash
assistance as a part of a broader range of
interventions for refugees to access health
care. As an example, cash was provided to
pregnant women to help them afford costs
associated with delivery, with the value and
targeting criteria adjusted depending on the
medical needs. Using the cash modality has
enabled UNHCR to assist more vulnerable
people of concern with the same overall
budget. The cost of delivery is up to
four-times less if women pay for the care
themselves, rather than being referred to
health services by UNHCR’s partners.

-----------------------Page 152 End-----------------------

Responding with Lifesaving Support

Food security and nutrition
In 2016, food assistance was provided to
more than 4.8 million refugees in
30 countries. However, global funding
shortages led to cuts in food assistance for
refugees during the year, ranging between
14 per cent in Ethiopia to 75 per cent in
Uganda. Limited resources had to be
shared across a larger population, often in
contexts where the food security and
nutrition situation were already precarious.
Populations of concern in the East and Horn
of Africa were particularly affected due to
conflict and drought conditions weakening
food security. Nutrition screening among
Somali refugee arrivals in Dollo Ado,
Ethiopia, revealed levels of acute
malnutrition as high as 79 per cent (against
the emergency threshold of >15%). Globally,
nutrition programmes contributed to global
acute malnutrition (GAM) remaining within
acceptable levels in 36 of the 66 surveyed
refugee-hosting locations.
UNHCR worked closely with WFP to mitigate
the risks of diminishing food rations for
refugees, and to target the available food to
the most vulnerable. The UNHCR-WFP “Joint
strategy for enhancing self-reliance in food
security and nutrition” (2016) aims to support
refugees in protracted situations of
displacement by combining the distribution
of food rations with livelihood support to
build self-reliance. In recognition of the need
to target assistance to those most in need,
UNHCR and WFP also worked on a joint
targeting mechanism that allows a more
comprehensive assessment of a household’s
socio-economic situation. In December 2016,
UNHCR launched a food analysis and
coordination tool to strengthen the
monitoring of food assistance and

|

T H E M AT I C C H A P T E R S

coordination globally. With WFP support,
UNHCR has begun to collect information
through this tool as part of efforts to improve
food assistance programming.
UNHCR’s comprehensive multi-sectoral
approach to reduce mortality among children
aged 5 and under within the first six months
of new emergencies, adopted in 2014
through its “Global strategy for public
health,” recorded encouraging results in
2016. By year-end, mortality among children
under five had decreased to within
acceptable standards in 99 per cent of
non-emergency operations, against
93 per cent of the 140 locations monitored
in 2014. However, 74 per cent of
refugee-hosting sites reported levels of
child anaemia above critical thresholds and
none of the 160 sites surveyed in 2016
recorded acceptable child anaemia levels.
Further, stunting levels amongst children
aged 6–59 months were above the critical
level (>30%) in 63 per cent of the 160 sites
surveyed, and met the standard (<20%) in
only around 25 per cent of sites. These
results highlight the necessity of maintaining
efforts to improve the nutritional status of
refugee children.
To address the complex causes of
malnutrition, UNHCR promotes low-cost,
high-impact interventions, including
kangaroo mother care for pre-term infants
and prioritized assistance to families with
infants. As an example, UNHCR used a
special nutritional product for children
under two years old, which had good
success in Chad. In collaboration with
Save the Children, UNHCR revised the
multi-sectoral infant and young child
feeding (IYCF) framework to expand
prevention activities.

Comprehensive shelter and settlement strategies were developed in all 25 operations with
a shelter budget of $1 million or above; 84% (21 out of 25) of operations were implementing
their strategy by end-2016.
Shelter and settlement planning in both emergency and protracted situations was
strengthened through 87 technical support missions.
A settlement folio was developed to analyse the design and service distribution of
5 refugee settlements and highlight key lessons learnt to inform settlement planning in
various contexts.

Enhance capacity to deliver a
combination of settlement options

26 UNHCR and partner staff benefited from 2 settlement and shelter trainings on the use of
standardized software, hardware and tools.
60 physical site planning toolkits were procured, with 9 rolled out to field operations.
The “Introduction to settlements and shelter” e-learning programme was launched; 62 staff
completed the programme in 2016.

Invest in research and development
for alternative shelter solutions

UNHCR continued its collaboration with Better Shelter to further develop the refugee
housing unit (RHU). By the end of 2016, more than 5,600 RHUs were deployed to field
operations. All operations with RHUs were supported to ensure accurate assembling and
proper maintenance.
Technical tests and specifications for the new self-standing tent were finalized.

News and views

Driven by hunger, Iraqis risk all
to flee Mosul violence
This article is an adapted version of a UNHCR news story.
16 December 2016

On 10 December, more
than 500 displaced Iraqis
arrived at Laylan 2 camp
from in and around
Hawiga.

KIRKUK, Iraq | Driven by hunger, Iraqi
mother Iqbal Qalaf picked her way across
a minefield in the dark with her children in
search of food and safety.

She is among hundreds of displaced Iraqis
who waded through rivers, walked across
minefields and carried their children to
reach safety at the recently opened camp,
south of the city of Kirkuk.
Hawiga district fell in the summer of 2014
and has been encircled since Iraqi security
forces advanced towards nearby Shirgat
earlier this year, ahead of the offensive to
retake the city of Mosul and surrounding
areas.
In addition to nearly 97,000 displaced by
fighting in and around Mosul since the
start of the offensive on 17 October, an
estimated 51,000 people have also fled the
deteriorating humanitarian situation in and
around Hawiga since August. Civilians have
reported a lack of access to medical care
and children suffering from malnutrition.
Laylan 2 camp was opened by UNHCR at
the start of December in response to the
large numbers of displaced people fleeing
Hawiga. Hundreds of civilians have been
arriving at Kurdish peshmerga front lines
every week after walking all night over open
ground ridden with explosives.

“No one would be crazy enough to walk
for three hours in the night but we had
to – we were hungry. We had to cross
through areas with mines,” she said,
clutching her youngest son, shortly after
they arrived at Laylan 2 camp.

On December 10, more than 500 displaced
Iraqis arrived at Laylan 2. These numbers
are expected to rise in the coming weeks
as supplies in the town run critically low.
Families are being forced to pay smugglers
to escape to Kurdish controlled territory in
order to find food.
“If you went to Hawiga you would cry from
hunger. There is no medicine for the sick,
nothing,” said Bade Hussein, 33.
“I hope it is better here,” said Bade,
assessing her new tent in the darkness after
reaching safety. “It is horrible on the other
side – they take kids and slaughter them.”
Her youngest daughter coughed and rattled
an empty plastic jar that had contained
some milk. Her four young children had skin
lesions and were wearing filthy, wet clothes.
Families arriving at Laylan 2 on Saturday
evening received blankets, mattress and
food parcels from UNHCR and its partners.
As the sun set, they were led to their
assigned tents.

As the Mosul conflict enters its third month,
and the number of people displaced climbs
towards 100,000, UNHCR is bolstering its
capacity to host and support civilians fleeing
the fighting as cold weather sets in.
“People fleeing for their lives are in a state
of utter distress and are in need of both
moral and material support,” said Bruno
Geddo, UNHCR’s Representative in Iraq. “Our
priority as UNHCR is to make sure that they
receive relief items and have access to a
safe place as soon as they reach us.”
Armed groups took over the district’s
hospitals and ambulances, so families have
not had access to medical care. Fighters
confiscated civilians’ animals and farming
equipment and imposed harsh punishments
for smoking or trying to escape.
Families escaping Hawiga and nearby
villages told UNHCR that they were living
off bread made with stale wheat and water
after basic items like tomato paste and
sugar became too expensive.

to UNHCR’s efforts to find solutions and
advocate equitable responsibility sharing
for refugees. In 2016, the Office significantly

increased its resettlement submissions,
while also working to expand refugee
access to complementary pathways to help
widen the options available to refugees

able to acquire the knowledge and skills to
become key actors in their future. With
partners, the Office also facilitated
refugees’ access to, inclusion in, and
contribution to formal economies by

supporting their engagement in local,
national and global value chains, and
advocating their inclusion in national
development plans.

Promoting access to education
More than 984,000
refugee children
were enrolled in
primary education
and 85,300 refugee
adolescents in
secondary
education in 2016.

Education supports the development of
skills critical for personal growth and
engenders broader economic and social
benefits, such as community development
and reconstruction. In situations of
displacement, education can provide
children and young people with a safe
space for learning and play, alleviating
some of the effects of trauma and reducing
their vulnerability to protection risks, such

as early marriage, dangerous onward
movements, smuggling and human
trafficking, and child labour.
Facilitating access to quality education is
at the heart of UNHCR’s solutions-based
approach for the protection of refugees.
In 2016, the Office continued working with
governments and other partners to
facilitate refugees’ access to national

education systems. By the end of the year,
64 of 81 countries assessed had policies
in place supporting the inclusion of
refugee children in national education
systems. More than 984,000 refugee
children were enrolled in primary
education, including more than
250,000 children in 14 countries who
were previously not attending school.
Despite this progress, UNHCR estimates
that only half of refugee children attended
primary school in 2016, and a mere
22 per cent of refugee adolescents had
access to secondary education. To close
this gap, the Office continued its efforts to
increase access to, and the quality of,
accelerated learning programmes as a
viable pathway to certified education for
over-age and out-of-school refugee youth.
Some 42,000 young refugees participated
in accelerated and other non-formal
learning programmes during 2016.

classrooms with technology that connected
students to dynamic educational resources
and the broader online world. By 2016,
27 “instant network schools” were
established in the Democratic Republic of
the Congo (DRC), Kenya, South Sudan and
the United Republic of Tanzania. These
facilities have benefitted more than
31,000 students and 570 teachers.
Close to 4,400 refugees in 38 countries
received DAFI scholarships to undertake
higher education. In addition, some
1,500 students undertook higher education
through “connected learning” programmes,
which combine face-to-face instruction with

KEY AREAS OF
INTERVENTION IN 2016

Implement the regional child
protection initiative covering the
Horn of Africa and Yemen

KEY ACHIEVEMENTS IN 2016
The regional initiative “Live, learn and play safe” (2014-2016) for unaccompanied and
separated children, and other children at risk, was in its final year of implementation in
6 locations in Egypt, northern Ethiopia, Sudan and Yemen. The project has had a positive
impact on the well-being of individual children and strengthened the overall child protection
response by UNHCR and partners.
The number of children who moved onward in northern Ethiopia was reduced, including
through family-based care arrangements. Children in family-based care were found to be
20% less likely to depart than unaccompanied children in other forms of care.

Strengthen programming for
adolescents and youth

23 youth-initiated and led protection projects were supported through the Youth Initiative
Fund (YIF), benefiting 779 adolescents and young people (375 females and 404 males) in
9 countries. YIF projects demonstrate that young people, supported with training and
resources, can be creative problem solvers who are capable of designing, leading and
implementing successful projects that benefit themselves and their communities. For
example, YIF projects in Cox’s Bazar, Bangladesh, focused on improving mental health and
well-being by using theatre as a tool for engagement and social inclusion (particularly for
adolescent girls).

Strengthen child protection
response in emergencies

Roving experts in child protection during emergencies, including those deployed by Save
the Children Norway and Sweden, supported refugee and IDP operations in Ethiopia,
Greece, Iraq, Italy, Malawi and Uganda. In Greece, support was provided to initiate best
interests procedures and community-based alternative care for unaccompanied children. In
Malawi, support was provided to establish emergency registration procedures that facilitated
the identification of children at risk and appropriate referral mechanisms.
27 UNHCR staff, primarily in eastern and southern Africa, benefitted from the annual child
protection learning programme.

Strengthen capacity for the
protection of children

Operational tools and child protection issue briefs were developed and disseminated, with a
particular focus on best interests procedures linked to durable solutions.
Training events at global, regional and country levels were organized, including the joint
UNHCR-Save the Children training on child protection and education in refugee settings.
UNHCR became a member of the Executive Committee and Founding Board of the Global
Partnership to End Violence Against Children, established to promote the 2030 Sustainable
Development Agenda and Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), in particular SDG 16.2.

Promote the protection of displaced
children and youth in inter-agency
fora

Specific considerations for refugee and displaced children were integrated into the “Field
handbook on unaccompanied and separated children” issued by the Inter-Agency Working
Group on Unaccompanied and Separated Children.
UNHCR worked with partners to operationalize the “Global compact on young people in
humanitarian action,” a commitment to address the needs of young people in conflict
endorsed at the World Humanitarian Summit.
As part of its efforts to expand the number of child protection actors engaged in work
related to stateless children and birth registration, UNHCR organized a specific session on
programmatic approaches to protecting stateless children and youth, at the first annual joint
meeting of the Alliance for Child Protection in Humanitarian Action and the Child Protection
Area of Responsibility.

improve learning effectiveness for more than 100,000 learners.

Enhance access to tertiary education

A consortium of connected learning partners, led by UNHCR and the University of Geneva,
developed quality standards for connected learning, strengthened coordination, and
expanded access to accredited tertiary education for 1,500 refugees.
A total of 4,397 refugees in 37 countries received DAFI scholarships to undertake higher
education.

Cash assistance for education
UNHCR is using the cash modality for
education in a range of interventions across
15 operations to increase student enrolment
and retention. These include cash grants for
school-related expenses, such as uniforms,
learning supplies, transport and school fees;
subsistence allowances for students,
particularly at the higher-secondary and
tertiary levels; and the payment of
incentives to refugee teachers.

In 2016, UNHCR conducted a review to
understand how cash assistance can better
contribute to educational outcomes. The
review will inform the development of
technical guidance and tools on the use of
cash-based interventions (CBI) in
education, to be rolled out in operations in
2017.

Building Better Futures

Empowering refugee youth
Young people constitute a large proportion
of refugee communities and have specific
needs based on their age and stage of
development. Refugee youths often face
diminished prospects for their education,
employment and skills development, and
uncertainty for the future. The isolation,
marginalization and hardship of forced
displacement also increases the
vulnerability of young people to protection
risks, including exposure to violence,
exploitation, substance abuse, and
recruitment into gangs or armed groups.
In 2015-2016, close to 1,500 young people
(15-24 years; 58% male and 42% female)
from refugee and host communities in
34 countries participated in the Global
Refugee Youth Consultations. These
consultations were organized by UNHCR
and the Women’s Refugee Commission,
together with States, civil society and other
partners (see Supporting UNHCR’s work

chapter). The drive, entrepreneurism,
language abilities, technological savviness
and other skills of refugee youth mean they
play essential roles in supporting their
peers, families and communities. Young
refugees self-organize to provide peer-topeer support, as well as vital community
services, in formal and informal ways.
For UNHCR and the youth involved, the
global consultations were the beginning of
a process to develop the leadership,
capacity and potential of refugee youth
around the world. Participants developed
their own framework for action to help
inform the way that humanitarian actors
engage with young refugees. The
framework consists of seven core actions,
including in relation to empowering,
developing the skills and capacities,
protection, and supporting the physical
and emotional well-being of refugee
youths.

Livelihoods as a driver for self-reliance

Building the self-reliance of refugees equips
and prepares them for the future and to
take advantage of whatever durable
solution will become available. Self-reliant
refugees lead independent and productive
lives, and are better able to enjoy their
rights and live in dignity.
UNHCR considers access to livelihood
opportunities, namely refugees’ ability to
make a safe and sustainable living, an
important driver for self-reliance. In 2016,

2015. However, refugee access to lawful
employment remains limited, including in
States party to the 1951 Convention.
Livelihoods programming informed by
market dynamics is more likely to assist
refugees in securing safe and sustainable
livelihoods, and enable them to contribute
to the community and economy. The
Office’s “Operational guidelines for the

minimum criteria for livelihoods
programming” supported 80 country
operations implementing livelihood
initiatives to ensure that programmes are
market-oriented and results-driven. The
guidelines align UNHCR with industry
standards, such as the Small Enterprise
Education and Promotion Network’s
Minimum Economic Recovery Standards.
UNHCR also worked with the OECD and
employers to facilitate refugees’ access to
local labour markets. In response to the
increased number of asylum-seekers and
refugees arriving in Europe in 2015-2016,
several companies endeavoured to employ
new arrivals. However, legal frameworks,
administrative barriers, language gaps and
other factors hindered the employment
initiatives from reaching scale. To better
support companies to overcome challenges
and facilitate employment opportunities for
refugees, a series of business consultations
were conducted and a joint UNHCR-OECD
policy brief on the findings was published.
Financial inclusion can also enhance access
to livelihood opportunities and contribute to
self-reliance. In 2016, UNHCR and the
Swedish International Development
Cooperation Agency agreed to launch a

pieces as part of a
programme that

artisans.

$15 million partial credit guarantee facility,
designed to increase refugees’ access to
credit by reducing the risks to financial
service providers in host countries.
To enhance the inclusion of the most
impoverished in livelihood efforts, UNHCR
adopted the graduation approach (see
Glossary), a poverty-reduction methodology
that supports the extremely poor to
‘graduate’ out of poverty, in 2013. Related
programmes have since been initiated in
Burkina Faso, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Egypt,
Zambia and Zimbabwe.
Results of these programmes in 2016 were
encouraging. Unemployment rates in
Costa Rica among 114 refugee and host
community members, for example,
decreased from 36 per cent in 2014 to
4 per cent, while self-employment rates
among participants increased from
24 per cent to 59 per cent. On ‘graduation’,
close to 80 per cent of participant
households achieved a monthly household
income equal to, or greater than, the national
minimum wage, increasing from a baseline
of 15 per cent. The Government of Costa
Rica is integrating the graduation approach
into its national development plan, which will
further ensure programme sustainability.

KEY ACHIEVEMENTS IN 2016

INTERVENTION IN 2016

Community empowerment and self-reliance
Self-reliance and livelihoods improved
New indicators for livelihood interventions were field-tested in 4 country operations.
The livelihoods expert roster was expanded to more than 40 technical experts; 9 country
operations were supported by deployments from the roster.

Improve the quality of livelihoods

Technical support missions were conducted to 22 operations (Algeria, Cameroon, Chad,
Costa Rica, Djibouti, Ecuador, Egypt, Ethiopia, Jordan, Kenya, Malaysia, Mauritania, Mexico,
Mozambique, Nepal, Panama, Thailand, Tunisia, Uganda, United Republic of Tanzania,
Zambia and Zimbabwe).
30 UNHCR staff were trained in livelihoods programming.
UNHCR staff received market analysis training from ILO, which enabled market analysis to
be conducted in Cameroon.
A new global artisan strategy to support refugee artisans’ access to international markets
was developed. As part of the strategy, local social enterprises were identified as business
partners in 6 countries and will work with refugee artisans under fair trade conditions to
support product development, production and sales.

Support refugees to access
international markets

Multi-faceted interventions were undertaken to improve the quality of artisanal products
made by refugees in 6 countries (Burkina Faso, Egypt, Kenya, Malaysia, Rwanda and
Thailand).
Programme tools were developed to determine when refugee-made products are market
ready.

Increase employment and
self-employment opportunities for
poor and ultra-poor refugees

UNHCR partner Trickle Up secured $2.5 million to expand graduation approach initiatives to
additional geographic areas, and to provide additional technical support over the next three

Resettlement and other forms of admission
Resettlement continued to gain widespread
global attention in 2016. The need for
greater solidarity and responsibility-sharing
to protect and assist refugees was
emphasized in several high-level meetings
throughout the year, starting with the
High-Level Meeting on Global
Responsibility-Sharing Through Pathways
for Admission of Syrian Refugees in March,
and culminating in the UN Summit for
Refugees and Migrants in September 2016.
As an outcome of the Summit, States
committed to work towards increasing
resettlement places and other legal
pathways for the admission of refugees on
a scale commensurate with the annual
resettlement needs identified by UNHCR.
Although the number of resettlement places
available globally continued to be
significantly lower than the overall
resettlement needs, estimated by UNHCR
to be close to 1.2 million refugees, or
7 per cent of the global refugee population
under UNHCR mandate, resettlement

opportunities did increase significantly in
2016. UNHCR worked with 37 resettlement
countries, up from 33 in 2015, and many
countries announced increased
resettlement quotas during the year.
In response to this increase in resettlement
quotas, UNHCR significantly scaled up its
resettlement activities and made more than
162,000 resettlement submissions, a
20-year high and increase of 21 per cent
compared to 2015. The top countries of
origin for resettlement referrals by UNHCR
were the Syrian Arab Republic (77,200), the
DRC (22,800) and Iraq (12,800). Generous
donor funding to the supplementary appeal
for “Strengthening refugee resettlement
and other pathways to admission and
solutions” allowed the Office to strengthen
its resettlement processing capacity,
including in areas such as registration,
refugee status determination and
community-based protection, in Africa and
the Middle East and North Africa.

The number of
resettlement States
increased to 37 from
33 in 2015.
125,600 refugees
departed for
resettlement, an
increase of over
50 per cent from
2015.

More than 125,600 refugees were able to
start a new life through resettlement in
2016. The main countries of destination
for resettled refugees were the United
States of America (78,300), Canada
(21,800), Australia (7,500) and the United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern
Ireland (5,000).
During the year, UNHCR played a critical role in
supporting and guiding resettlement States as
they built robust and sustainable resettlement
programmes. Of note was the organization’s
close collaboration with the UK in designing its
Vulnerable Children’s Resettlement Scheme,
as well as work undertaken with European
Union partners to expand and expedite the
resettlement processing of Syrian refugees.
These initiatives were critical in ensuring more
resettlement opportunities were provided to
vulnerable refugees.
Focus was also placed on strengthening the
integrity of the resettlement process.
New policy and guidelines on addressing
fraud committed by people of concern were
being finalized and additional integrityfocused positions were created in several
operations. Field operations were also
supported with capacity building and
technical expertise to minimize vulnerability
to fraud.

UNHCR GLOBAL REPORT 2016

Many initiatives to share experience and
boost the capacity of newer resettlement
States were taken in 2016. The “Emerging
resettlement countries joint support
mechanism” (ERCM), a platform established
to help countries create robust and
sustainable refugee resettlement
programmes, was launched at the Leader’s
Summit on Refugees hosted by the United
States in September. UNHCR worked
closely with IOM and governments in
developing the ERCM’s structure and
programme of work, beginning a
comprehensive mapping of needs and
opportunities that would benefit from
technical support through the mechanism.
In addition, the “Global refugee sponsorship
initiative” (GRSI), a partnership between
UNHCR and the Government of Canada,
the Open Society Foundations, the
University of Ottawa, and the Radcliffe
Foundation, was launched to promote and
support the establishment of private
sponsorship programmes for refugees.
In addition to providing refugees with
protection and a durable solution, private
sponsorship programmes can expand
community engagement in the resettlement
process, create a more welcoming
environment for refugees, and foster
diverse and inclusive societies.

Durable solutions
Potential for resettlement realized
162,500 resettlement submissions were made, a 20-year high and increase of 21% from
2015 (134,000 submissions).
The number of resettlement States increased to 37 from 33 in 2015.
125,600 refugees departed for resettlement, an increase of over 50% from 2015 (81,900).

Resettlement submissions

Streamlined and expedited processing modalities were developed, such as the
identification-based methodology for Syrian refugees.
The expanded use of group processing (based on new criteria) of Congolese refugees in
Rwanda was developed.
UNHCR’s evidence base on resettlement activities was expanded through the development
of a resettlement data portal (http://www.unhcr.org/resettlement-data.html).
New policy and guidelines on addressing fraud committed by people of concern were
being finalized for roll-out in 2017.

Ensure the integrity of the
resettlement process

Training-of-trainers on investigating fraud by people of concern was conducted for anti-fraud
focal points and newly-recruited integrity officers.
4 multi-functional technical anti-fraud missions were undertaken to support field operations
in minimizing fraud.
New and revised learning tools and training on resettlement were developed and rolled out.

Build resettlement capacity

More than 800 UNHCR staff and affiliate workforce members benefitted from 8 resettlement
training sessions, 6 on-the-job learning workshops and more than 100 webinars.
2,100 months of deployment support were provided to field operations through 4 NGO
partners.
The ERCM was established to build the capacity of new resettlement States.
Efforts to broaden engagement in resettlement by the GRSI were supported.
Support and guidance were provided to resettlement countries in establishing, expanding
and implementing new resettlement programmes.

Enhance partnerships

UNHCR continued to work closely with the Government of the Netherlands, followed by the
Government of New Zealand, as chairs of the Annual Tripartite Consultations on
Resettlement in 2016. The consultations aim to strengthen cooperation and foster open and
frank dialogue between governments, NGOs and UNHCR on topics such as integration and
preparing refugees for resettlement.
The Syrian Core Group continued to play an important role in mobilizing support for
increased and more harmonized efforts to resettle Syrian refugees. An additional
80,000 places were pledged for resettlement and other forms of admissions for Syrian
refugees by States in 2016, bringing the total numbers pledged since 2014 to more
than 242,000.

Complementary pathways
Complementary pathways are safe and
regulated avenues which allow refugees to
be admitted into, and to stay in, a country,
have their international protection needs met
while supporting themselves to reach
sustainable and lasting solutions. Although
complementary pathways are not meant to
substitute the protection afforded to
refugees under the international protection
regime, they serve as an important and
complimentary expression of global
solidarity, international cooperation and
more equitable responsibility sharing.
Complementary pathways include, but are
not limited to, provisions for family
reunification, labour mobility schemes,
education and training programmes, and
other special visa categories. Critical to their
realization is the recognition that refugees
have the right to access the same mobility
opportunities and acquisition of skills as
others, which can help refugees to attain a
sustainable and durable solution in the
future.
UNHCR’s objective is to achieve new
commitments from States to identify and
increase the number and range of

complementary pathways for refugees,
which can facilitate a progressive approach
to attaining durable solutions. To this end,
the Office is finalizing a framework, as well
as guidance and tools, on complementary
pathways for reference by States, refugees,
civil society, private sector and other
stakeholders.
UNHCR continued to research and map
complementary pathways that could be used
by refugees, including labour mobility and
education opportunities. The Office also
advocated that States make family reunion
more accessible, including for extended
family members.
In addition, UNHCR supported the
development of initiatives such as Japan’s
sponsorship of 100 Syrian postgraduate
students over five years, commencing in
September 2017; the pledge by the Peace
University in Costa Rica to sponsor
500 refugee students for five years; and
work with the NGO partner Talent Beyond
Boundaries in facilitating employment for
refugees through labour mobility schemes in
third countries.

Voluntary repatriation
An estimated
552,230 refugees
returned to their
country of origin in
2016, including
500,200 who were
assisted by UNHCR.

166

•

Circumstances in many countries in 2016
prevented the voluntary repatriation of
refugees in safety or dignity, and the context
in which some refugees returned to their
home countries remained complex.
Concerns that some returns may not be
sustainable stemmed from some reports by
refugees that their decision to return was
based on a lack of viable protection and

UNHCR GLOBAL REPORT 2016

solutions options elsewhere. Throughout
2016, UNHCR’s operational role in return
situations was context-specific and included
working with governments; engaging in
ongoing dialogue with refugees to plan for
sustainable reintegration; verifying the
voluntary nature of returns; gathering and
analysing information to help refugees make
informed decisions; monitoring returns;

-----------------------Page 168 End-----------------------

Building Better Futures

conducting advocacy; and providing other
repatriation assistance and reintegration
support.
In 2016, an estimated 552,230 refugees
returned voluntarily to their country of origin,
351,000 more than in 2015. During the year,
UNHCR assisted some 33,800 Somali
refugees to return home from Kenya. In Côte
d’Ivoire, more than 20,000 Ivorian refugees
have returned home since resumption of the
return process in December 2015, and
UNHCR expects to facilitate the voluntary
repatriation of a further 13,700 people during
2017 as part of its comprehensive regional
durable solutions strategy for Ivorian
refugees. Support for voluntary repatriation
was provided to more than 5,500 Rwandan
refugees who returned in 2016, mainly
from the DRC. At the end of 2016, the
number of spontaneous refugee returns to
the Central African Republic had reached
an estimated 34,000.

T H E M AT I C C H A P T E R S

The year also saw a surge in the return of
Afghan refugees from Pakistan, with more
than 370,000 registered Afghan refugees
returning home. The scale marked a 10-year
high. There were just over 58,000 returnees
in 2015. Some 2,200 Afghans from the
Islamic Republic of Iran also repatriated. With
Pakistan continuing to host some 1.3 million
registered Afghan refugees, and UNHCR’s
return monitoring showing that refugees
present multiple, interlinked factors
influencing their decision to
return—including economic hardship,
harassment, fear of arrest and deportation,
as well as positive factors including
perceived improvement in the security
situation, and the State’s commitment to
provide land and shelter on return—UNHCR
worked closely with authorities to counsel
and assist returning refugees, and to monitor
returns as extensively as possible while
advocating further efforts to create
conditions for sustainable return.

Cash assistance for returnees
In 2016, UNHCR provided in repatriation
grants some $150 million to support the
safe and dignified repatriation of refugees.
Cash assistance formed part of a broader
package of assistance to help returnees
cover the costs of repatriation, such as

self-organized transport, documentation
and administrative fees. Cash grants also
helped meet initial reintegration needs,
such as food, shelter, medical care and
education, and helped to establish
livelihoods.

Building Better Futures

Multi-year, multi-partner protection and solutions
strategy
The protracted nature of many conflicts, and
the rising number of people of concern to
UNHCR, heightens the need to plan for
protection and solutions from the onset of
displacement. Accordingly, the Office in 2016
strengthened its multi-year, multi-partner
(MYMP) planning to work with partners to
assess and address the economic, social,
cultural, legal, civil and political dimensions
necessary to secure solutions for
populations of concern within three to five
years.
In 2016, UNHCR operations in Costa Rica,
Ecuador, Ghana, Senegal, Uganda and the
United Republic of Tanzania developed
MYMP strategies to achieve concrete,
longer-term protection and solutions
objectives, in collaboration with governments
and other partners. As an example, the
MYMP strategy in Uganda will help align
UNHCR programming with local district
planning, as well as the implementation of a
$50 million World Bank loan provided to the

Government to support host communities
and displaced populations. In Costa Rica and
Ecuador, the strategies build on new and
expanded civil society partnerships to better
support governments in applying the
graduation approach to poverty eradication,
to benefit both refugees and local
communities.
Experience over the years has led to an
understanding that unlocking solutions
requires direct and early links to national
development planning, as well as a wide
range of local and international actors
focused on longer-term support. The MYMP
approach facilitates field operations to plan
in a more strategic and coherent way, in
coordination with a wider range of
stakeholders, and aims to provide forcibly
displaced people with more opportunities to
achieve durable solutions. UNHCR took the
decision to expand the roll-out of MYMP
strategies to an additional 15 countries in
2017.

Alternatives to camps
UNHCR’s “Policy on alternatives to camps”
promotes context-specific approaches,
creating opportunities for refugees to fully
exercise their rights and live lawfully,
peacefully and productively in hosting
communities. This approach builds on, and
invests in, the resources and capacities of
refugees, and enhances synergies with
national and local development,
infrastructure and service delivery systems.

168

•

UNHCR GLOBAL REPORT 2016

In 2016, UNHCR used its diagnostic tool for
alternatives to camps to analyse the
implementation of its policy in
90 operations, supporting some
15.7 million refugees. The results
highlighted many positive developments,
including the increased use and coverage
of CBIs to protect and assist people of
concern.

-----------------------Page 170 End-----------------------

Building Better Futures

Initiatives promoting and operationalizing
the policy included integrated settlement
planning in Chad, Malawi and Rwanda;
supporting governments to include
refugees in national development planning
and services; and improving approaches to
targeting assistance in out-of-camp
settings.
In Uganda, UNHCR worked closely with
partners, including the World Bank, to
develop a multi-year, multi-sectoral,
development-oriented strategy that would
help implement the inclusion of refugees in
the National Development Framework II for
2015/16 to 2019/20. This strategy is
grounded in existing development plans and
UNHCR’s MYMP framework, and focuses on
strengthening the self-reliance and resilience
of refugees and host communities.
In Rwanda, where refugees were recently
integrated into national education systems,
UNHCR and the Government jointly
facilitated a national stakeholder consultation
aimed at increasing the self-reliance of
refugees and their participation in the local
economy.
UNHCR is also applying the Master Plan
approach (see Glossary) to implement

T H E M AT I C C H A P T E R S

alternatives to camps. This approach
explores how infrastructure development
and service provision in refugee settlements
can serve the interests and needs of both
refugee and host communities, with the
objective that the settlement typology
evolves into a sustainable integrated
community. The approach is being piloted in
Chad, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique and
Nepal. A key element of the Master Plan
approach is investment in service
infrastructure and facilities, to enhance their
standards and capacity.
In 2016, UNHCR started implementing a
global initiative to strengthen the consistency
and coherence of targeting approaches for
urban and out-of-camp refugees. The project
provides technical expertise to support field
operations in developing and implementing
assistance targeting strategies in urban and
out-of-camp settings. Targeting processes
included data collection and analysis; setting
eligibility criteria; planning the delivery of
assistance; communicating with displaced
communities; and establishing complaint and
feedback mechanisms to ensure transparent
and effective implementation and
accountability.

Access to energy and environmental protection
Millions of displaced people lack access to
clean, safe and secure energy. UNHCR
invests in the environmental sustainability of
its interventions to help mitigate the impact
of refugee settlements on the environment,
and increase refugees’ access to
sustainable energy. These measures benefit
both refugee and host communities and
promote peaceful co-existence, particularly
in operational contexts where natural
resources are scarce.
The positive outcomes of past investments
are becoming increasingly evident. In
Rwanda, a carbon credit project providing
fuel-efficient stoves to refugees resulted in
carbon emission reductions of up to
17,650 tonnes over a three-year period,
from 2014-2016, while also reducing the
level of deforestation and soil erosion.
Furthermore, the daily lives of refugees
improved with the decreased risk of burns,
reduced exposure to risks associated with
collecting firewood, such as SGBV, and an
increase in the time women and children
could spend engaging in education or
livelihood activities.

Solar power plants in Jordan’s Azraq and
Zaatari refugee camps are scheduled for
completion in 2017 and have the potential
to provide renewable energy to more than
30,000 refugee households as well as
schools and medical centres, decrease
electricity costs by more than $10 million
annually, and reduce carbon emissions by
more than 19,000 tonnes each year.
UNHCR promotes market-based
approaches which engage affected
communities in the selection of energy
goods and services appropriate for their
needs, enhance the development of
livelihoods and entrepreneurship, increase
private sector involvement, and expand
local markets. In Malawi, UNHCR worked
with the local community and local
government environmental service to
restore an informal reception site that
suffered from deforestation, accelerated
erosion and degradation of a water stream.
In Ghana, shallow waste pits were
rehabilitated into arable land, enabling
refugees to grow food crops. The Office
also continued to explore innovative and

Collaboration and partnerships were also
strengthened to expand the use of
environmentally-friendly and cost-effective
approaches, facilitate sharing of expertise
and resources, and create strong policies
and guidelines on energy and environment
programming. In line with its “Global
strategy on safe access to energy (SAFE)”
(2014-2018), UNHCR initiated the process of

resources for climate change adaptation
and mitigation. The Office also began
developing a holistic $50 million proposal
for climate-smart energy and environmental
programmes in Cameroon, Niger, Rwanda
and the United Republic of Tanzania, as well
as guidance on solar water pumping and
community lighting, in partnership with the
World Bank and Phillips Lighting, to improve

An online learning programme on safe access to fuel and energy in displacement settings
was launched.
30 participants from 15 operations received training to strengthen UNHCR’s capacity to
incorporate energy and environmental considerations in programming.
Technical capacity for energy programming was strengthened in collaboration with
universities, NGOs and private sector partners.

Enhance research and partnerships

UNHCR and Engineers Without Borders USA signed a memorandum of understanding to
provide technical expertise for planning and implementation of energy projects.
UNHCR and Georgetown University undertook a comparative evidence-based study
(“Environmental impact of refugee camps: resource usage and management”) in Djibouti and
Ethiopia to provide guidance on reducing environmental impacts in displacement settings.

Test innovative approaches to
energy and environment

UNHCR partnered with LandLife to test a tree planting approach, called “cocoon,” which
uses a nutrient-rich, plant-feeding pot to grow seedlings in adverse conditions. In Malawi,
330 cocoons were tested and had a modest survival rate of 55%. Several factors
contributed to the survival count, including hot weather conditions, pests such as termites,
and disease.
In Nepal, in collaboration with the IKEA Foundation and Engineers Without Borders USA,
mini-grids for community lighting were designed, installed and maintained with support from
the community, to provide cost-effective solar street lighting.

climate change dates to the mid-1980s and
has advanced since 2000, both regarding
policy development and operational
response.
In 2016, UNHCR committed to supporting
two new coordination entities. The first was
the Platform on Disaster Displacement (PDD),
which started work in July 2016 to implement
the Nansen Initiative protection agenda for
cross-border disaster displacement. UNHCR
is directly supporting the coordination unit of
the PDD, is an observer of the steering
group, and is a member of the advisory
committee. The Office contributed to
developing the PDD work plan, which
includes specific activities to which UNHCR
contributes or leads.
The second was the Task Force on
Displacement of the UNFCCC Warsaw

Agreement to develop recommendations for
integrated approaches to address, minimize
and avert displacement associated with
climate change. UNHCR is a member of the
task force to ensure protection is
mainstreamed in responses to displacement
situations associated with climate change
impacts.
UNHCR also participated in several
international and inter-agency processes
focused on disaster displacement to help
ensure coordination and policy coherence.
These included the UNFCCC Climate
Change 22nd Conference of Parties in
December 2016 and its work with UN
Agencies and governments to support
implementation of the Paris Agreement and
the Nansen Initiative Protection Agenda on
cross-border displacement in the context of

Syrian seamstress becomes a part
of community fabric
This article is an adapted version of a UNHCR news story.
15 December 2016

Norine Verberg, Bronwen Cooke,
Lucille Harper and Cindy Murphy
are part of a group of sponsors
that work closely with the Al Zhouri
family to help in the resettlement
process in Antigonish, Canada.

ANTIGONISH, Canada | When a local
hockey coach phoned Rabiaa Al Soufi, she
didn’t hesitate before agreeing to help. Fifty
hockey jerseys were dropped off at her
house, all needing name plates sewed on as
soon as possible.

With skills honed from years of teaching
sewing and tailoring in Syria, a heap of
finished jerseys piled up quickly. “Even
though this is a very simple thing, I am
grateful that of all people I was able to
provide this to them,” says Rabiaa.
The five members of the Al Zhouri family
were resettled to the town of Antigonish,
on Canada’s eastern shores, in January
2016. The family fled conflict back home
in Al-Qusayr, Syria, for Lebanon and, for
five years, had been unable to work or
attend school.
For both Antigonish and the province
of Nova Scotia, the intake of refugees
served two purposes: to give shelter to
those in need and to grow a dwindling
population with capable workers. By the
end of 2016, Nova Scotia hopes to have
resettled 1,500 Syrians.
Soon after arriving, the quiet emptiness of
the winter surprised Rabiaa. For the first
five months, she felt alone. Her mind often
drifted back to her home in Syria and the

Rabiaa quickly got to work, spending
the next few nights hunched over a
sewing machine. Her husband and
children helped out where they could,
eager to make a good impression on the
community that had recently welcomed
the family.
war. But the family’s sponsors in Canada
gave them new hope and strength.
Cindy Murphy and other sponsors
brought Rabiaa to social events as often
as possible. “I would have to say, bar
having my children and getting married,
this is one of the most important things
that I’ve ever done,” says Cindy.
The large group of sponsors, made up
of community members and university
students, often spent hours at Rabiaa’s
house, drinking tea and conversing. As
her mood brightened, Rabiaa started
baking and sewing again—jobs she’d
once thrown herself into in Syria.
What began as a way to fill her days
soon turned into a small business. Her
sponsors arranged for a table at the
weekly farmer’s market to sell her Syrian
pastries.
Then, after staring at a worn couch in their
new home, Rabiaa crafted a new couch
cover. When her sponsors visited, they
marveled at the stitching and design.

Soon, word got out in the small town
about Rabiaa’s talents. Customers would
leave her market stall with cookies and
appointments for tailoring or upholstering.
Working alongside her husband Toufic,
a skilled carpenter, the couple created a
niche service in the area.
And as Rabia’s presence in the community
grew, her family’s did too. Her eldest son,
Majd, between a job and school, took
the lead in a community theatre play to
improve his English and confidence. Her
younger children, Ranim and Aghyad,
volunteered in the community and quickly
became fluent in English. Her husband
built a reputation as a carpenter. Amid the
family’s growing successes, the sponsors
helped where they could.
“It’s an enriching process to be working
alongside newcomers,” says Cindy
Murphy, one of the residents who
sponsored the Al Zhouri family. “But I’m
going to have to stop using that word
in a little while. Because, really, they’re
very much a fabric of our community.”

In recent years forced displacement has reached
unprecedented levels, with 2016 seeing the highest
level of people displaced by violence and persecution
since the Second World War. Host countries and their
national populations continue to generously host
millions of forcibly displaced people around the world.
The changing scale and scope of global displacement
has dominated the attention and compelled the
international community to revisit traditional
approaches. The World Humanitarian Summit, the
United Nations General Assembly high-level meeting

on addressing large movements of refugees and
migrants, and the subsequent adoption of the
New York Declaration for Refugees and Migrants
followed by the Leaders’ Summit on Refugees
held in 2016 recognized forced displacement as
the defining humanitarian and development
challenge of our time. Developing new
approaches and diversifying innovative
partnerships remain essential for UNHCR to
effectively respond to the protection and needs
of people of concern.

This chapter highlights the important role
played by traditional and non-traditional
partners, including UN agencies and
international organizations, NGOs,
development actors, private sector, host
governments, host communities and
celebrities, in leveraging support to people of
concern and enabling UNHCR to carry out its
work in 2016.

Hosting the world’s refugees
In recent years, global forced displacement
has reached unprecedented levels, with
around 86 per cent of displacement and
refugee situations being located in the
developing world and almost two-thirds of
refugees in protracted displacement
situations. While the conflict in the Syrian
Arab Republic (Syria) has been the largest
refugee producing situation—and with the
neighbouring countries of Jordan, Lebanon
and Turkey having borne the brunt of the
associated challenges—conflicts in other
parts of the world are still driving sizeable
numbers of people into host countries like
Ethiopia, Niger, Uganda and the United
Republic of Tanzania. Others, like Kenya
and the Islamic Republics of Iran and
Pakistan, have been hosting large numbers
of refugees for decades.

countries in 2016 | in millions

food, water and shelter. Despite concerns
over the security and political
consequences, host countries and their
populations have generally demonstrated
their strong commitment to the principles of
refugee protection and international
obligations, and their efforts deserve
recognition.
Although the majority of contemporary
refugee situations are protracted, few
credible analyses of the costs and benefits
have been recorded. This is partially
explained by the fact that, statistically, most
refugee arrival numbers have barely
exceeded 3 per cent of a country’s
population. This largely explains why
baseline data on the social and economic
impacts of refugee situations on host
communities has rarely been collected.

Chart 1

The immediate response to most
large-scale refugee movements focuses
understandably on the condition of the
displaced people themselves. From the
perspective of humanitarian actors, the
over-riding emphasis is on providing
essential and life-saving assistance, such as

176

UNHCR GLOBAL REPORT 2016

The issue has deservedly gained greater
attention as a result of the huge
demographic shock experienced by Jordan,
Lebanon and Turkey in absorbing millions of
Syrian refugees since 2011. The economic
effects, including increased costs to the
hosting governments, have drawn greater
donor attention. Indeed, in parallel with the
rising fiscal expenditure on education,
health and other critical services there is
also wider recognition of the public good
that has been provided by Syria’s
neighbours through offering protection to
refugees.
Importantly, the Syria situation has also
highlighted the needs of host communities,
which have all too often been overlooked.
The consequences of a sudden
demographic increase can be considerable,
and can result in substantial pressure on

service delivery in critical sectors
like education and health, on
consumption of natural
resources such as water, land
and forests, on labour markets,
and on prices of essential
commodities.
The effects on the host
communities are influenced by
existing socio-economic
circumstances prior to the
refugees’ arrival, by the nature
and scale of the refugee presence
and composition, and by the policy
and operational response pursued
by the authorities and their
international partners. Typically,
refugee arrivals occur in border
regions where development
progress frequently lags behind
national indicators and where
government service provision may
be limited. The number of refugees
and displaced people and their
socio-economic profile often
influence the immediate ease or
difficulty a country has in absorbing
them. The policy and operational
response of a government and local
authorities are critical factors in
determining the pace at which host
communities absorb more people
and recover from the impact of this
demographic change.

If not addressed adequately, the resulting
imbalances can generate tensions between
local communities and refugee and other
displaced populations. In that context, it is
important for UNHCR and all concerned
stakeholders to ensure a timely and
effective response for refugees, while also
facilitating support for, and social cohesion
with, host communities.

The provision of food, water, and shelter is
a life-saving measure in the initial stages of
an emergency. Perceptions of inequality
among host communities can arise,
however, especially in contexts where the
incidence of local poverty is itself extremely
high. As refugees start to consume natural
resources, to use local services, to
purchase goods in local markets driving up

prices, and to look for livelihood
opportunities, any tensions arising from
their presence can become more real.
The consequences may not appear in
national statistics but they can be relatively
dramatic at household level. There is
certainly evidence that if goods and
services are already scarce prior to the
arrival of refugees, particularly in vulnerable
areas, prices will rise in response to an
often inadequate supply of staple goods
and services to meet increased demand.
Depending on the prevailing
socio-economic context and the type, level,
speed and quality of the response, any
initial problems generally stabilize and both
refugees and host communities adjust to
the new context. Moreover, there is growing
evidence that over time, and with the right
approaches and investments, refugees can
benefit the communities hosting them.
They often bring new opportunities,
particularly in under-served regions where
socio-economic development is limited.
They represent an increase in the number
of consumers, thus a spur to local
productivity, trade and business, and attract
government and international engagement,
aid and private sector investment.
As refugee situations can take many years
to resolve, longer-term, structural support is
required to ensure that the overall
socio-economic conditions of refugees and
host communities are addressed through a
more holistic approach. Humanitarian action
alone cannot meet the challenge of
large-scale displacement, and development
resources and approaches targeting both
refugees and host communities, with a

178

particular focus on livelihoods and
education, are critical. Therefore, UNHCR
strengthened its collaboration with the
World Bank, as well as with regional
financial institutions, development agencies
such as UNDP, and the private sector.
When refugees are given the chance, they
can support themselves and their families,
and make positive contributions to the
communities hosting them. Refugees and
host communities mutually empower each
other, socially and economically.
Furthermore, equipping refugees with skills
and resources enables them to contribute
to the reconstruction of their countries and
building peace when they return.
At the United Nations General Assembly
high-level meeting on addressing large
movements of refugees and migrants held
in September 2016, Member States
unanimously adopted the New York
Declaration for Refugees and Migrants. This
landmark political declaration aims at
improving the way in which the international
community responds to such movements of
refugees and migrants, including protracted
refugee situations.
These new initiatives offer real hope that all
stakeholders, humanitarian and
development actors, multi and bilateral
donors, civil society and private sector
partners, will work more effectively and
more efficiently towards supporting
countries hosting refugees, not only in
providing protection and short-term
assistance but also reducing needs and
vulnerabilities of the forcibly displaced and
affected local communities.

The New York Declaration: a vision of shared
responsibility
The New York Declaration for Refugees and
Migrants, unanimously adopted by
193 Member States at the United Nations
General Assembly high-level meeting on
addressing large movements of refugees
and migrants in September 2016,
represented a milestone for international
solidarity and refugee protection at a time of
growing global displacement. It reaffirmed
the importance of international refugee
protection principles, contained an extensive
set of commitments to enhance the rights
and well-being of both refugees and
migrants, and called for a more
comprehensive, predictable, sustainable and
collaborative response based on
international solidarity. The Comprehensive
Refugee Response Framework (CRRF),
annexed to the New York Declaration,
provides an important framework for a more
systematic and sustainable response.

It also offers a platform for developing
partnership-based responses to large-scale
refugee situations and engage with a much
broader group of stakeholders, including:
government authorities, UN and national
partners, international and regional financial
institutions, development actors, businesses
and civil society actors.
With respect to refugees, UNHCR has been
tasked with articulating and applying the CRRF,
including in protracted situations. The Office
has since embarked on broad consultations on
the CRRF with Member States, United Nations
agencies, NGOs, international financial
institutions, civil society, academic
communities and others. In 2016, the
framework was piloted in several countries,
namely Djibouti, Ethiopia, Somalia, Uganda
and the United Republic of Tanzania, and will
be further extended in 2017.

World Humanitarian Summit
At the World Humanitarian Summit in Istanbul,
held in May 2016, UNHCR endorsed the five
core responsibilities of the “Agenda for
humanity” and made several commitments,
including through the Grand Bargain (see
Funding UNHCR’s programmes chapter and
Glossary) to promote greater coherence,
efficiencies, transparency and accountability.

The organization committed to enhancing
inter-agency efforts to place protection at the
centre of humanitarian action, to ensure
predictable engagement in situations of
internal displacement, and to champion efforts
to end statelessness. The Office also
co-signed the “Commitment to Action,” which
calls for a new way of working.

Refugee response coordination
Under the leadership of host governments,
partnership-based and inclusive
coordination is a pre-condition of an
effective refugee emergency response and
has a direct impact on the delivery of
protection and assistance to refugees. The
Refugee Coordination Model (RCM – see
Glossary) offers an inclusive platform for
strategically planning and coordinating
refugee response. UNHCR’s refugee
coordination role promotes best practice in
order to make refugee coordination more
predictable, inclusive and collaborative.
In line with the RCM, UNHCR continued to
assume its leadership role in refugee
situations, nominating regional refugee
coordinators responsible for leading

operational planning, resource
mobilization and implementation of the
Refugee Response Plans (RRPs – see
Glossary). The RRPs provide a
comprehensive picture of identified
needs, impact on host communities,
operational strategy and financial
requirements. In 2016, seven RRPs were
in place with plans for the Yemen and
Europe situations co-led with IOM, and
the plan for the Syria situation co-led with
UNDP. The RRPs covered 27 countries,
and involved more than 480 partners,
requested $6.930 billion in funding to
meet assessed needs, and reported
$4.108 billion in contributions. The overall
funding level of RRPs was 59 per cent
(see table below).

Considering lessons learned and feedback
received from partners, UNHCR
strengthened its partnerships and
coordination with IOM, OCHA, WFP and
UNICEF. The Office also further
strengthened training and capacity building
of its staff and partners, including by
updating learning programmes.

Wherever applicable, UNHCR and OCHA
collaborated in the framework of the “Joint
UNHCR-OCHA note on mixed situations” in
mutual respect for each other’s mandates,
roles and responsibilities. In 2016,
inter-agency missions with IOM, OCHA,

Partnership within the United Nations system and
with other international organizations
UNHCR remained committed to coordination
in the framework of the Inter-Agency
Standing Committee (IASC – see Glossary).
The Office established coordination
arrangements with other UN agencies and
international organizations at the global and
field levels to respond to internal
displacement situations and continued to
implement the Transformative Agenda (see
Safeguarding fundamental rights chapter
and Glossary).
As a member of the United Nations
Development Group (UNDG), UNHCR
participated in preparations for the
“Quadrennial comprehensive policy review”
(QCPR) resolution for 2017-2020, which sets
out clear priorities to help achieve the 2030
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The
QCPR focused on improving system-wide
coordination, including between
humanitarian and development actors;
enhancing Member State oversight of the
work of the UN development system; and
reforming the Resident Coordinator system.
UNHCR supported development partners to
progress these policy objectives and ensure
coherent and coordinated humanitarian and
development responses to forced
displacement.
With other key UN system partners, UNHCR
pursued efforts to strengthen protection

issues are taken into consideration in the
work of the UN development system. In
2016, efforts were made to engage agencies
on several critical human rights challenges
and identify ways to bring UN partners in the
field together to address them. Statelessness
was one of the themes identified. A joint UN
work plan was agreed and is now being
implemented.
UNICEF - UNHCR and UNICEF strengthened
their partnership in the field to support
people of concern in the areas of water,
sanitation and hygiene; health and nutrition;
education; and child protection. In 2016, a
new letter of understanding was signed
between UNHCR and UNICEF in Ethiopia.
Furthermore, the two organizations
strengthened their collaboration on
information management for child protection
and SGBV case management.
WFP - As cash-based interventions (CBIs) are
increasingly being used to cover food and
other assistance needs (see Responding
with lifesaving support chapter), UNHCR and
WFP will add a specific addendum on cash
assistance to their existing memorandum of
understanding. They also carried out joint
vulnerability assessments to better target
beneficiary populations, and established a
new data-sharing agreement and monitoring
arrangements for cash-based assistance.
IOM - UNHCR and IOM signed a joint letter,
which aimed to improve coordination for
emergency response, joint planning and

Partnering with NGOs
With a view to increasing complementarity,
UNHCR enhanced its collaboration with
national and local partners, working to
complement and reinforce national
capacities, with an emphasis on
sustainability. Building on the High
Commissioner’s “structured dialogue with
NGOs,” UNHCR undertook three joint field
missions with the International Council of
Voluntary Agencies (ICVA) and InterAction
to El Salvador, Greece, and the United
Republic of Tanzania in 2016, bringing the
total number of joint missions undertaken
since the beginning of the structured
dialogue to nine. This was a useful platform
for improving quality of partnerships
between NGOs and UNHCR. Its impact will
expectedly increase with the New York
Declaration and will provide further scope
to enhance partnerships with NGOs on
protection and solutions.

A record-breaking year for the
annual consultations with
NGOs, focusing on youth
Every year, UNHCR’s annual consultations
with NGOs bring together representatives
from NGOs and other partners, and provide
opportunities for dialogue, exchange of
best practices and global networking. In
June 2016, the event brought together
520 participants from international and
national NGOs, United Nations agencies
and intergovernmental organizations to
discuss the theme of “Youth.”

In Asia and the
Pacific, refugee
youth formed a
regional network
to work on the
identified
challenges and
implement core
actions for refugee
youth. This network
is supported by the
Asia Pacific Refugee
Rights Network, one
of the major NGO
consortia in the
region.

Prior to the annual consultations, national
consultations with refugee and local youth
were conducted during the year with the
Women’s Refugee Commission in Chad,
Ecuador, Jordan, Kenya, Morocco, Pakistan,
Turkey, Uganda and Zambia. The national
consultations concluded with the Global
Refugee Youth Consultations held in June,
followed immediately by the 2016 annual
consultations with NGOs. During these
consultations, 30 refugee and host
community youths shared their experiences,
demonstrated their capacities, and
elaborated on the challenges they faced.
The dynamism of those present and the
direct involvement of a large number of
people of concern made the 2016 annual
consultations with NGOs one of the most
successful so far.

Strengthening the framework
for implementing with partners
UNHCR disbursed
$1.4 billion to over
830 partners to
provide protection
and assistance, as
well as find durable
solutions for people
of concern.

UNHCR worked with more than 830 partners,
including NGOs, governments and UN
agencies, to protect refugees and provide
vital support during displacement situations.
In line with its Grand Bargain commitments,
the Office committed to increasing the flow of
resources to national partners to better
support local response capacity and build
sustainability. In 2016, UNHCR disbursed
$1.4 billion to 837 partners, including nearly
$1.1 billion to 673 NGOs, an increase of about
$165 million compared to 2015. Of this
amount, $614 million was provided to local
partners, including $432 million to national
NGOs.
Throughout the year, consultations with
major NGOs, including the African NGO
Platform, ICVA, InterAction and other
partners, extended the “Enhanced
framework for implementing with partners,”
which aims to provide assistance and
protection to people of concern and
accountability for resources provided by

donors. Building on the rollout of new
policies and procedures related to the
framework, six regional workshops and
three thematic webinar sessions were
conducted to improve the use of resources.
Audits were also conducted to enhance
accountability and the sound stewardship of
resources entrusted to UNHCR and
partners.
The UNHCR Partner Portal enabled the
organization to manage and expand
partnerships, and facilitated partners’
access to UNHCR information, guidance
and funding. At the end of 2016, more than
1,500 partners had registered on the portal,
and interest in it remained widespread.
Based on this portal model, UNHCR
engaged partners in the development of a
common United Nations partner portal.
Furthermore, in line with the Office’s Grand
Bargain commitments, UNHCR initiated
consultations with UNICEF and WFP to
simplify the partnership management
process and enhance partnerships with
local and national responders.

and development actors, moving dialogue
forward on solutions for refugees, increase
resilience and self-reliance of refugees, and
support host communities.
Furthermore, it committed to strengthening
partnerships supportive of strong and inclusive
national systems, as underscored by the New

long-established strategic partnership with
UNDP, UNHCR strengthened its collaboration

financial institutions. As a result, in June 2016,
the organization signed a memorandum of
understanding with the Organisation for
Economic Co-operation (OECD) that led to the
establishment of a Temporary Working Group
on Refugees and Migration. This will provide
guidance and recommendations to OECD
State members; improve development
programming and financing to better support
countries of origin, transit and destination; and
expand the achievement of comprehensive
solutions.
In July 2016, UNHCR and ILO signed an
updated memorandum of understanding,
underlining their commitment to promoting
inclusive and equitable access to decent
work, livelihoods, and social services and
systems. UNHCR is working with ILO and
others to support the implementation of the
“guiding principles on access of refugees and
other forcibly displaced people to the labour
market,” adopted by the ILO Governing Board.

Strengthening the World Bank Group partnership
UNHCR strengthened its partnership with
the World Bank to build an evidence base
on the root causes of, and solutions to,
displacement, as well as to expand
opportunities for refugees and other people
of concern through inclusive economic and
development policies, approaches and
facilities at national and regional levels.
In September 2016, the World Bank issued
its report, “Forcibly displaced: Toward a
development approach supporting refugees,
the internally displaced and their hosts.” The
report emphasized the importance of
complementary partnerships between
humanitarian and development actors. It
followed a series of analytical reports,
prepared together with UNHCR, on different
refugee situations, as well as policy papers

on forced displacement and the economic
impact on host communities, endorsed by
the World Bank’s Development Committee
and regional multilateral development banks.
Therefore, the World Bank’s Board of
Governors approved $2 billion to support
refugee host countries in its next round of
International Development Association (IDA)
lending, covering 2017 to June 2019. The
Board also approved an allocation of
$14 billion for fragile, conflict- and
violence-affected States. Joint UNHCR-World
Bank planning missions to prepare the
programmes will be conducted in eligible
countries during 2017. UNHCR also explored
new opportunities for closer cooperation in a
number of displacement situations with the
African Development Bank and the Islamic
Development Bank.

In 2016, the refugee situation in Europe triggered a
surge of support to UNHCR from the private sector
in Australia. This included the Vietnamese
community, who arrived in Australia as refugees in
the 1970s and 1980s. They organized fundraising
events across Australia, with their efforts attracting
nation-wide media attention and raising over
$410,450.

A highlight, among several donor events in 2016,
included UNO-Flüchtlingshilfe’s engagement with
German students who undertook a sponsored run
from Germany to Spain, Sweden and Turkey to
increase public awareness and show solidarity with
refugee students. Teams of students started in Berlin
and Munich were sponsored to travel as far as they
could. They raised $106,000 to support the DAFI
programme, enabling young refugees to study in
South Africa.

To raise public awareness and increase the
number of individual donors, España con ACNUR
launched #ahorapuedesverlo (Now you can see
it), using virtual reality to immerse the public in
fictional refugee situations. The campaign elicited
a strong media response and was instrumental in
communicating UNHCR’s work to the public. More
than 140,000 new donors were recruited during
the year.

with Aftonbladet, Sweden’s largest media outlet,
launched #tittaintebort (Do not look away) to raise
public awareness for the plight of some
300,000 Syrians trapped in eastern Aleppo.
Within a week, more than 25,000 people donated
$500,000 to support UNHCR’s response.

In its initial phase, the initiative secured
commitments from more than 51 American
corporations, including Airbnb, Facebook,
Google and Microsoft to provide support in the
areas of education, self-reliance and
livelihoods. Airbnb, in partnership with USA for
UNHCR, launched the #BelongAnywhere

several years. In the wake of the
Mediterranean crisis, Lovisa and her

Emergencies
The private sector plays an important role in
supporting emergency situations around
the world. The ability to raise large amounts
of flexible contributions and quickly
mobilize the public, corporations, and
foundations to support immediate needs
arising from emergencies is essential. In
2016, the private sector responded to
UNHCR’s emergency appeals to support
refugee situations, including in Europe and
Syria. With National Partners, UNHCR
launched a global emergency campaign in
response to the Ecuador earthquake,
raising $2.2 million in the four weeks
following the earthquake. Within 10 days,
UNHCR had organized two airlifts, provided
by its partner, UPS.

vital in enabling UNHCR to share positive
stories of displaced people and those helping
them. Since it was established in 1954, more
than 60 people, groups and organizations
have been acknowledged for their dedication
and outstanding work with, and on behalf of,
refugees.

The HRT and Efi Latsoudi evenly split the
monetary prize of $150,000, which was jointly
donated by the Norwegian and Swiss
Governments. The HRT will focus their efforts
on fire, road and earthquake safety training in
refugee camps, whilst Efi Latsoudi will invest
in ways to bring refugees and Greek citizens
together.

The Award is now considered UNHCR’s
flagship event, raising awareness of families
forced to flee and why they need protection
through compelling content and
storytelling.

UNHCR’s supporters helped celebrate
outstanding service to the cause of refugees
at the Nansen Refugee Award ceremony in
October 2016, with contributions from Neshan
Der Haroutiounian, Emi Mahmoud, Lyse
Doucet, The Grey People, and Baaba Maal.

In 2016, Konstantinos Mitragas, on behalf of the
Hellenic Rescue Team (HRT), and Efi Latsoudi,
the human rights activist behind “PIKPA village”
on the Greek island of Lesvos, were honoured
as joint winners, recognizing their tireless
voluntary efforts to aid refugees arriving in
Greece. Their actions reflected the spirit of
volunteerism that characterized the response to
the refugee and migrant crisis in Europe.

UNHCR would like to thank the generous and
ongoing support of the Swiss Federal
Council, State Council of the Republic and
Canton of Geneva, the Administrative Council
of the City of Geneva, the Government of
Norway, the Norwegian Refugee Council, and
the IKEA Foundation.

News and views

I am Yusra. I am a refugee and I’m
proud to stand for peace
This article is an adapted version of a UNHCR news story.
11 January 2017

My name is Yusra. Yes, I’m the girl
who swam for her life, then swam
at the Olympics. Now I want to
tell you another story. It’s about
my other name, my other identity.
You see, my name is refugee. At
least, that’s what they call me. Me
and those 21 million others forced
to flee persecution, war and
violence.

Yusra Mardini inspired
displaced people all
over the world when
she swam at the
Olympic Games.
Now she is working
on new goals.

"I want to represent all
the refugees because I
want to show everyone
that after the pain and
after the storm comes
calm days."
Yusra Mardini
Syrian refugee and Olympic
hopeful

So here we are, in a new life, none of
us knowing how long we will live it. On
average, we’ll spend 20 years in exile, never
really belonging, just waiting for an end to
the madness so we can go home. That’s half
a lifetime, lost, nothing but strangers in a
strange land.
We struggle on with our lives. We fight to
study, to work, to learn a new language, to
integrate. All too often the barriers are too
high, the odds stacked against us. But we
know we must make the best of this strange
and unexpected twist in our lives. To make
the best of being a refugee.
That’s our struggle. But this isn’t just our
fight, it’s yours too. Many of you already
know there’s so much more at stake. For my
part, in the months to come I’ll be taking on
a new role. I have an important message to

© U N HCR

So, who is this refugee? Well, once
I was just like you. I had a home,
I had roots, I belonged. Like you,
I lived my life day-by-day, caught
up in my own hopes, passions and
problems. Then war came and
everything changed.

spread. The refugees will not go away, there
will be more of us. If humanity is to meet this
challenge, you must know us for who we
really are.

that being a refugee is not a choice. That
our only choice was to die at home or risk
death trying to escape. It was the choice
between a bomb and drowning at sea.

Silence gave the other voices space to
grow. From those who feared and hated
us because we looked different, spoke
differently, worshiped differently. Those who
were most afraid shouted the loudest. They
spread those old lies about us. They said we
chose to come here, because we’re greedy,
dangerous, criminals, here to threaten your
way of life.

So, who are we? We are still the doctors,
engineers, lawyers, teachers, students we
were back at home. We are still the mothers
and fathers, brothers and sisters. It was
violence that made us orphans. It was war
that made us terrified parents, sacrificing
everything to save our children from
carnage. It was persecution that drove us
from our homes in search of peace.

Fear crept in and some of you began to
doubt us. Before long, borders and barriers,
both physical and emotional, sprang up
everywhere. Refugee was becoming an
insult, a name to hurt and humiliate.

That is refugee. That is who I am. That is
who we all are, that growing population of
people without a country. This is my call for
us all to take a stand now, together, under
that name we share, refugee. I am Yusra.
I am a refugee and I’m proud to stand for
peace, for decency and dignity for all those
fleeing violence. Join me. Stand with us.

But there is no shame in being a refugee if
we remember who we are. If we remember

MEMBERS OF UNHCR’s EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE
AND STATES PARTIES TO THE REFUGEE AND
STATELESSNESS CONVENTIONS
UNHCR is governed by the United Nations General Assembly and the Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC). In 1958,
ECOSOC established the Executive Committee of the High Commissioner’s Programme (ExCom), pursuant to a resolution
of the General Assembly. Its main tasks are to approve the High Commissioner’s programmes, advise the High
Commissioner in the exercise of his/her functions (mainly on protection issues), and oversee the Office’s finances and
administration.
ExCom holds an annual session in Geneva every October. The sixty-seventh session took place from 3-7 October 2016.
Meetings of ExCom’s Standing Committee are held at various dates throughout the year to carry on the work between
plenary sessions.
ExCom membership is elected on the widest possible geographical basis from those States (members of the United
Nations) with a demonstrated interest in, and devotion to, the solution of refugee problems. By the end of 2016, there
were 98 ExCom members - in blue - in the following table which also shows the States parties to the 1951 Refugee
Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol and to the 1954 Convention relating to the Status of
Stateless Persons and the 1961 Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness.

Asylum

Brazil Plan of Action

The granting of protection by a
State on its territory to
individuals from another State
who are fleeing persecution or
serious danger. Asylum
encompasses a variety of
elements, including
non-refoulement, permission to
remain on the territory of the
asylum country and humane
standards of treatment.	

In 2014, the governments of
Latin America and the
Caribbean met in Brasilia to
mark the 30th anniversary of
the Cartagena Declaration on
Refugees of 1984. At the end
of the Ministerial Meeting,
28 countries and three
territories in Latin America and
the Caribbean adopted by
acclamation the Declaration
and Plan of Action of Brasilia,
agreeing to work together to
maintain the highest standards
of protection at the
international and regional level,
implement innovative solutions
for refugees and displaced
persons, and end the difficult
situation faced by the stateless
persons in the region.	

Asylum-seeker
Any person who has applied
for international protection
as a refugee and is awaiting
the determination of their
status.

AU Convention for the
Protection and Assistance
of Internally Displaced
Persons in Africa (Kampala
Convention)
This African Union Convention
was adopted in 2009 and
entered into force on
6 December 2012. It is the first
legally binding instrument on
internal displacement on a
continent-wide scope. It
provides a comprehensive
regional framework setting out
provisions for the protection
and assistance of IDPs. The
Convention also looks at the
root causes of displacement
and at ways to prevent it.

Assessment made by staff
regarding the individual
protection needs of displaced
children to ensure that care
programmes give primary
consideration to the child's best
interests.

Best interests
determination

Comprehensive solutions
strategies
Strategies whereby UNHCR
engages with concerned
parties (including authorities in
country of asylum, origin and
affected refugee themselves)
with the aim of enhancing
solutions opportunities by
applying a combination of
durable solutions. These
strategies have included
support for voluntary
repatriation; the strategic use
of resttlement; increased
opportunities for local
integration; support to
refugee-hosting community by
UNHCR, development partners
and bilateral donors; as well as
maximized opportunities for
greater mobility as a pathway
to solutions.	

Convention on the
Reduction of Statelessness
(1961 Convention)
A treaty that provides for the
acquisition of nationality by
those who would otherwise be
stateless and who have an
appropriate link with the State,
through birth on the territory or
through descent from a national.
The Convention also provides
for the retention of nationality
by those who would become
stateless if they were to lose
their nationality to that State.
UNHCR has been mandated
with specific functions under
Article 11 of this Convention.

Convention refugees
Persons recognized as
refugees by States, under the
eligibility criteria in Article 1 of
the 1951 Convention, and are
entitled to the enjoyment of a
variety of rights under that
treaty.	

-----------------------Page 206 End-----------------------

Convention relating to the
Status of Refugees (1951
Convention)
This treaty establishes the most
widely applicable framework for
the protection of refugees. The
Convention was adopted in
July 1951 and entered into
force in April 1954. Article 1 of
the Convention limits its scope
to “events occurring before
1 January 1951” but this
restriction was removed by the
1967 Protocol relating to the
Status of Refugees.

Convention relating to the
Status of Stateless
Persons (1954 Convention)
A Convention that provides the
definition of a stateless person
and establishes a framework by
which a stateless person, who
is lawfully resident in a State,
can have legal status. The
Convention was adopted in
September 1954 and entered
into force in June 1960.

Dublin II Regulation
A European Council Regulation,
effective from 1 September
2003, which provides the legal
basis for establishing the
criteria and mechanism for
determining the State

asylum application in one of the
Member States of the EU
(excluding Denmark), as well as
in Iceland, Liechtenstein,
Norway and Switzerland.	

Durable solutions
Any means by which the
situation of refugees can be
satisfactorily and permanently
resolved, enabling refugees to
resume a normal life.
Traditionally, UNHCR pursues
the three durable solutions of
voluntary repatriation, local
integration, and resettlement.	

Earmarking
A donor restriction that limits or
directs the purpose for which a
contribution may be used.
UNRESTRICTED CONTRIBUTIONS

(also referred to as
unearmarked funding)
No limitations on the use of funds.
BROADLY EARMARKED

level; for supplementary
programmes that cover more
than one country; and for a
specific theme or activity at the
subregional level or higher.
EARMARKED CONTRIBUTION

Contributions that are
earmarked for a specific
country, location or population
without any further limitations.
Also includes contributions for
supplementary programmes
that cover only one country.
TIGHTLY EARMARKED

Exclusion clauses
Legal provisions that deny the
benefits of international
protection to persons who
would otherwise satisfy the
criteria for refugee status.
In the 1951 Convention, the
exclusion clauses are found in
Articles 1D, 1E and 1F. These
clauses apply to the following
categories:
• Individuals who are receiving
protection or assistance from
United Nations agencies other
than UNHCR;

• Individuals who possess the
rights and obligations
attached to the possession of
nationality of their country of
residence;
• Individuals in respect of whom
there are serious reasons for
considering that they have
committed a crime against
peace, a war crime, a crime
against humanity, a serious
non-political crime, or acts
contrary to the purposes and
principles of the United
Nations.

Executive Committee of
the High Commissioner’s
Programme (ExCom)
The Committee charged with
approving UNHCR’s assistance
programmes, advising the High
Commissioner on the exercise
of his/her functions and
overseeing the Office’s
finances and administration.
ExCom is composed of
representatives of 98 States
(2016) with a demonstrated
interest in refugee issues.
	

First country of asylum
concept
An asylum-seeker may be
refused access to the asylum
procedure in the country
where the application has
been made if the applicant
has already found protection
as a refugee in another
country (i.e. where
international protection has
been made available and is
accessible to the applicant).

Global Compact on
Refugees
See New York Declaration for
Refugees and Migrants.

Graduation approach
The graduation approach is a
poverty-reduction model that
aims to “graduate” people in
rural areas out of poverty
through a sequenced
combination of interventions.
The approach is part of
UNHCR’s “Global strategy for
livelihoods” (2014-2018).

International protection

An agreement reached in the
lead-up to the World
Humanitarian Summit between
the biggest donors and aid
organizations across ten work
streams, which aims to shrink
the humanitarian funding gap
and deliver more aid to the
frontline. The initiative stemmed
from the recommendations
contained in the report of the
UN Secretary-General’s High
Level Panel’s on Humanitarian
Financing, “Too important to
fail: addressing the
humanitarian financing gap.”

All actions aimed at ensuring
the equal access to and
enjoyment of the rights of
women, men, girls and boys of
concern to UNHCR, in
accordance with the relevant
bodies of law (including
international humanitarian,
human rights and refugee law).

New York Declaration for
Refugees and Migrants
On September 19, the UN
General Assembly adopted a
set of commitments to enhance
the protection of refugees and
migrants, known as the New
York Declaration for Refugees
and Migrants. It outlines
elements for a comprehensive
response to refugee
displacement based on
principles of international
cooperation and responsibilitysharing as well as greater
inclusion of refugees into local
communities.
This Comprehensive Refugee
Response Framework (CRRF) is
now being applied in a range of
specific situations, through the
mobilization of existing and
new partnerships with
development actors,
humanitarian NGOs, the private
sector and civil society under
the lead of host governments. It
contains four key elements
aimed at providing more
predictable and sustainable
responses to large movements
of refugees so as to:
• Ease pressure on host
countries;
• Enhance refugee self-reliance;
• Expand access to thirdcountry solutions;
• Support conditions in
countries of origin for return in
safety and dignity for
refugees.
The New York Declaration calls
on UNHCR to develop and
initiate the practical application
of the CRRF in each situation
involving large-scale
movements of refugees, with a
view to informing the Global
Compact on Refugees, to be
adopted by the General
Assembly by 2018.

OAU Convention
Governing the Specific
Aspects of Refugee
Problems in Africa
This regional complement to
the 1951 Convention provides
for a broader refugee definition.
Adopted in 1969, the OAU
Convention stipulates that the
term “refugee” also “applies to
those fleeing from external
aggression, occupation, foreign
domination or events seriously
disturbing public order in either
part or whole of the country of
origin.

Person of concern to
UNHCR
A person whose protection and
assistance needs are of interest
to UNHCR. This includes
refugees, asylum-seekers,
stateless persons, IDPs and
returnees.

Persons with specific
needs
Individuals, families or groups
requiring additional support in
order to enable them to
overcome the challenges they
face in accessing and enjoying
their rights.

Prima facie refugees
Individuals or a group of
individuals who are
recognized as refugees, by
a State or UNHCR, on the
basis of objective criteria
related to the circumstances
in their country of origin,
justifying a presumption that
they meet the criteria of the
applicable refugee
definition.

Programme support costs
The costs of organizational
units, whose primary functions
are the formulation,
development, delivery and
evaluation of UNHCR
programmes.

ANNEXES

Protection
All activities aimed at obtaining
full respect for the rights of the
individual, in accordance with
the letter and the spirit of the
relevant bodies of law (i.e.
international human rights law,
international humanitarian law
and international refugee law.)	

Refoulement
The removal of a person to a
territory where he/she would
be at risk of being persecuted,
or being moved to another
territory where he/she would
face persecution. Under
international refugee law and
customary international law,
refoulement is permitted only in
exceptional circumstances.

Refugee
A refugee is any person
who, “…owing to
well-founded fear of being
persecuted for reasons of
race, religion, nationality,
membership of a particular
social group or political
opinion, is outside the
country of his [or her]
nationality and is unable or,
owing to such fear, is
unwilling to avail him [or her]
self of the protection of that
country; or who, not having
a nationality and being
outside the country of his [or
her] former habitual
residence as a result of such
events, is unable or, owing
to such fear, is unwilling to
return to it.”
Article 1A(2) of the 1951
Convention
or
“who is outside his/her
country of origin or habitual
and is unable to return there
because of serious and
indiscriminate threats to life,
physical integrity or freedom
resulting from generalized
violence or events seriously
disturbing public order.”
OAU Convention and
Cartagena Declaration.

Glossary

Refugee coordination model
In line with the High
Commissioner’s mandate, it
outlines UNHCR’s role and
responsibilities and rearticulates and standardizes
UNHCR’s responsibility to lead
and coordinate international
actions relating to refugees
with all partners engaged in the
response through an interagency platform and under the
overall leadership of the host
government.	

Refugee status
determination
Legal and administrative
procedures undertaken by
States and/or UNHCR to
determine whether an
individual should be recognized
as a refugee in accordance with
national and international law.

Refugee-like situation
The category of people in a
refugee-like situation is
descriptive in nature and
includes groups of people who
are outside their country of
origin and who face protection
risks similar to those of
refugees, but for whom refugee
status has, for practical or other
reasons, not been ascertained.

Registration
Registration can be carried out
in different manners, depending
on the operational
circumstances and data
requirements. Level 1
Registration, often referred to
as “household registration”,
gathers only elementary
information from people of
concern for the purpose of
establishing a basic distribution
system or to provide
demographic estimates. In
Level 2 Registration, limited
personal data is collected from
each individual, for basic
planning, monitoring and
protection activities. Level 3

208

•

UNHCR GLOBAL REPORT 2016

Registration represents the
most comprehensive recording
of detailed personal data of
people of concern, which is
required for individual case
management and delivery of
durable solutions.

Reintegration
A process which enables
returnees to regain their
physical, social, legal and
material security needed to
maintain life, livelihood and
dignity and which eventually
leads to the disappearance of
any observable distinctions
vis-à-vis their compatriots. 	

Resettlement
The transfer of refugees from
the country in which they have
sought asylum to another State
that has agreed to admit them.
The refugees will usually be
granted asylum or some other
form of long-term resident
rights and, in many cases, will
have the opportunity to
become naturalized citizens.
For this reason, resettlement is
a durable solution as well as a
tool for the protection of
refugees. It is also a practical
example of international burden
and responsibility sharing.	

Results-based
management
A management philosophy and
approach that emphasize the
achievement of results as the
essential task of management.

Returnee
A person who was of
concern to UNHCR when
outside his/her country of
origin and who remains so,
for a limited period (usually
two years), after returning to
the country of origin. The
term also applies to IDPs
who return to their previous
place of residence.

Safe third country concept
An asylum-seeker may be
refused access to the asylum
procedure in the country where
the application has been made
if responsibility for assessing
the asylum application in
substance is assumed by a
third country, where the asylumseeker will be protected from
refoulement and will be able to
seek and enjoy asylum in
accordance with accepted
international standards.

Secondary movements
The notion refers to
asylum-seekers and refugees
moving independently from
their first host country to
another country in search of
protection and solutions.

Self-reliance
In the refugee context, the
ability of an asylum-seeker or
refugee to provide for his/her
own living needs, and those of
his/her dependants. 	

Sexual and gender-based
violence
Acts that inflict physical, mental
or sexual harm or suffering,
threats of such acts, coercion or
arbitrary deprivation of liberty,
that target individuals or groups
of individuals on the basis of
their gender.

Solutions Alliance
Aims to improve the lives of
displaced people—and the
communities that host
them—by responding more
collaboratively to displacement
and contributing to durable
solutions. It promotes and
enables the transition for
displaced persons away from
dependency towards
increased resilience,
self-reliance, and development
(www.solutionsalliance.org).

Glossary

Stateless person
Person who is not
considered as a national, by
any State under the
operation of its law,
including people whose
nationality is not established.

Subsidiary protection
Beneficiaries of subsidiary
protection are people who have
been found not to meet the
Convention definition of a
refugee but who face a real risk
of serious harm. This includes
the death penalty or execution,
torture or inhuman or
degrading treatment, or a
serious and individual threat to
their life or person by reason of
indiscriminate violence in
situations of armed conflict.	

Temporary protection
An arrangement or device
developed by States to offer
protection, of a temporary
nature, to people arriving en
masse from situations of
conflict or generalized
violence, without prior
individual status determination.
Temporary protection has been
mostly used in industrialized
States. 	

Trafficking (human)
The organized illegal
movement of people for profit.
The critical additional factor
that distinguishes trafficking
from migrant smuggling is the
use of force, coercion and/or
deception throughout, or at
some stage in the process.
While the additional elements
that distinguish trafficking from
migrant smuggling may
sometimes be obvious, in
many cases they are difficult to
prove without active
investigation.

Transformative Agenda
The Transformative Agenda of
the IASC was adopted in

|

ANNEXES

December 2011. It is a set of
concrete actions aimed at
transforming the way in which
the humanitarian community
responds to emergencies. It
focuses on improving the
timeliness and effectiveness of
the collective response through
stronger leadership, more
effective coordination
structures, and improved
accountability for performance
and to affected people.	

Unaccompanied and
separated children
Children in a situation of
displacement who are not in
the company of parents or
another adult caregiver.

Voluntary repatriation
Return to the country of origin
based on the refugees’ free
and informed decision.
Voluntary repatriation is one of
the three durable solutions and
may be organized (when it
takes place under the auspices
of the concerned governments
and/or UNHCR) or spontaneous
(the refugees return by their
own means with no
involvement of UNHCR and
governments).

World Humanitarian
Summit
An initiative of the UN Secretary
General, the Summit was held
in Istanbul, Turkey on 23-24
May 2016 and had three main
goals:
• To re-inspire and reinvigorate
a commitment to humanity
and to the universality of
humanitarian principles;
• To initiate a set of concrete
actions and commitments to
countries and communities to
better prepare for and
respond to crises, and be
resilient to shocks; and
• To share best practices which
can help save lives around the
world, put affected people at
the centre of humanitarian
action, and alleviate suffering.
