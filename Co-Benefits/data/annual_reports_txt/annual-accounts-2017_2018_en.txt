FOREWORD


                             It is my pleasure to present the 2017 annual accounts of the European
                             Union. They provide a complete overview of the EU finances and the
                             implementation of the EU budget for the last year, including information
                             on contingent liabilities, financial commitments and other obligations of
                             the Union. Reflecting the multiannual nature of the Union's activities, they
                             offer explanations of the key financial figures and their evolution. The
                             consolidated annual accounts of the European Union are part of the
                             Commission’s Integrated Financial Reporting Package and form an
                             essential part of our highly developed system of financial accountability.

                             While 2016 was a year of doubt for the European project, not least with
                             the decision of the United Kingdom to leave the Union, 2017 was a year of
                             renewed hope and perspective.


The 60th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome provided the backdrop to a period of deep reflection on the
future of Europe. We took the opportunity to reaffirm our commitment to the values of the Union and to
define the priorities for the Union of 27.

In 2017, the European Union focused on making the economic recovery sustainable. Growth rates for the
EU and the euro area beat expectations to reach a 10-year high of 2.4 %. Nevertheless, the EU had to
tackle a series of challenges related to competitiveness, migration or security, and address some major
natural disasters.

The EU budget is a unique asset for the Union that translates ambitions into tangible results on the
ground. It complements national budgets by delivering European added value in areas where a
coordinated response is the most efficient and effective way to deliver on our priorities.

2017 was the fourth year of the implementation of the current Multiannual Financial Framework; all the
financial programmes are now fully operational. At the same time, with many unexpected challenges, the
importance of a flexible approach to budget implementation was once more confirmed. The MFF mid-term
revision has provided additional means to respond to unforeseen circumstances.

The 2017 adopted budget focused on two main policy priorities for Europe: supporting the ongoing
recovery of the European economy and tackling the migration and refugee crisis. It ensured the
implementation of the ongoing programmes on the one hand, and provided for financial support to
address the new challenges on the other.

Nearly half of the funds – EUR 83.2 billion in commitments – stimulated growth, employment and
competitiveness. This included funding for research and innovation under Horizon 2020, for education
under Erasmus+, for small and medium sized enterprises under the COSME programme, and for
infrastructure under the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF). Moreover, the European Fund for Strategic
Investments (EFSI) provided for the implementation of the Investment Plan for Europe, and the
convergence among Member States and among regions was fostered through the European Structural
and Investment Funds (ESIF).

The European Fund for Strategic Investments has already triggered more than EUR 287 billion in
new investment and has helped creating more than 300 000 jobs. In December 2017, the European
Parliament and Council decided to increase and extend the fund to catalyse investments of up to
EUR 500 billion by 2020. The EFSI guarantee fund, which the Commission established to provide a
liquidity cushion to cover guarantee calls by the EIB group for its investments, has reached
EUR 3.5 billion at end 2017.

EUR 54 billion was allocated to programmes aiming to strengthen economic, social and territorial
cohesion, including the European Regional Development Fund, the Cohesion Fund, and the European
Social Fund. The Youth Employment Initiative, whose implementation accelerated in 2017, focuses on
decreasing youth unemployment throughout the Union. By the end of 2017 the total eligible cost of



                                                                                                            5

                                     Annual accounts of the European Union 2017

    operations selected for support reached nearly EUR 7 billion. Member States declare that 1.7 million
    young people have already benefitted from the assistance provided by the Initiative.

    Moreover, the EU budget served as an instrument of solidarity with e.g. EUR 1.2 billion mobilised under
    the EU Solidarity Fund, the highest sum ever provided in a single instalment, following the earthquakes of
    2016 and 2017 in the Italian regions of Abruzzo, Lazio, Marche and Umbria.

    EUR 58.6 billion were devoted to the promotion of sustainable growth and the preservation of
    Europe's natural resources. Programmes included the pillars of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) of
    market support measures and rural development, fisheries, and activities in the fields of climate and
    environment under the Programme for the Environment and Climate Action (LIFE).

    The EU budget also continued to underpin the comprehensive European response to the migration
    crisis and the management of Europe’s external borders. The Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund
    (AMIF) promoted the efficient management of migration flows and the development of a common Union
    approach to asylum and migration. The total of payments executed in 2017 amounted to
    EUR 576.2 million, almost a double of the 2016 figure. Financed by the EU budget, the European Border
    and Coast Guard Agency with its extended mandate has significantly strengthened its presence at the
    EU’s external borders with the aim of supporting the Member States in their border management
    activities and jointly implementing an integrated border management at EU level.

    The EU budget also allowed the Union to play a strong role beyond Europe during a period of turbulence
    in Europe’s neighbourhood. Last but not least, it contributed to the response to global challenges such
    as climate change by integrating mitigation and adaptation actions into all major EU spending
    programmes, with the total budget contribution to climate mainstreaming estimated at 20.3 % for 2017.

    An optimal performance of the Union’s budget has been a priority for the Juncker Commission from
    day one. We strongly support the increasing emphasis of the European Parliament, the Member States
    and the European Court of Auditors not only on how programmes are managed, but also on whether they
    are delivering results in the areas that really matter for Europe’s citizens.



    The Commission will continue playing its role, along with the budgetary authority, to harness the
    potential of the EU budget to invest in growth, create jobs and tackle our common challenges.




                                                                                      Günther H. Oettinger

EUROPEAN UNION POLITICAL
FRAMEWORK, GOVERNANCE AND
ACCOUNTABILITY

The European Union (EU) is a Union within which 281 European countries (the Member States) confer
competences to attain objectives they have in common. The Union is founded on the values of respect for
human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights, including the
rights of persons belonging to minorities. These values are common to the Member States in a society in
which pluralism, non-discrimination, tolerance, justice, solidarity and equality between women and men
prevail.


1.          POLITICAL FRAMEWORK
                            The overarching objectives and principles that guide the Union and the
                            European Institutions are defined in the Treaties. The Union and the EU
       EU Treaties          institutions may only act within the limits of the competences conferred by
                            the Treaties so as to attain the objectives set out therein and must do this
                            in accordance with the principles2 of subsidiarity and proportionality. To attain
its objectives and carry out its policies, the Union provides itself with the necessary financial means. The
Commission is responsible for implementing the objectives in cooperation with the Member States and in
accordance with the principle of sound financial management.

The EU pursues the objectives established in the Treaty with a number of tools, one of which is the EU
budget. Others are, for example, proposing legislation or pursuing policy strategies.

                              The Europe 2020 strategy agreed in 2010 by the Heads of State or
                              Government of EU Member States defines a 10 year jobs and growth strategy
      Europe 2020
                              at EU level for the EU3. The strategy put forward three mutually reinforcing
         strategy
                              priorities of smart, sustainable and inclusive growth with five EU headline
                              targets. Its success depends on all the actors of the Union, acting collectively.
The EU budget is only one of the EU levers contributing to the delivery of the Europe 2020 objectives. A
wide range of actions at national, EU and international levels are being mobilised to deliver concrete
results in relation to the Europe 2020 strategy.


                                 The Commission's political priorities are defined in the political guidelines set
    Commission political         by the President of the Commission, providing a roadmap for the
        priorities               Commission's action that is fully consistent and compatible with Europe 2020
                                 as the EU's long-term growth strategy.

     On 29 March 2017, the United Kingdom (UK) gave formal notification of its intention to leave the EU thus triggering
     the withdrawal process under Article 50 of the Treaty on the European Union. The UK is due to leave the EU on
     29 March 2019.
2
     Under the principle of subsidiarity, the Union shall act only if and in so far as the objectives of the proposed action
     cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States but can rather, by reason of the scale or effects, be better
     achieved at Union level. Under the principle of proportionality, the content and form of Union action shall not
     exceed what is necessary to achieve the objectives of the Treaties. See Article 5 of the TFEU.

                     A deeper and fairer Economic and                       A Union of democratic change.
                     Monetary Union (EMU).




                                Sustainable development has long been at the heart of the European project.
         2030 Agenda for        The EU Treaties give recognition to its economic, social and environmental
           Sustainable          dimensions which should be addressed together. The EU is committed to
          Development4          development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the
                                ability of future generations to meet their own needs. The EU budget plays an
    essential role in many sustainability challenges from youth unemployment to ageing populations, climate
    change, pollution, sustainable energy and migration. Under the current Commission sustainable
    development is mainstreamed in key cross-cutting projects as well as in sectoral policies and initiatives.

    The policies supported by the EU budget are implemented in accordance with the Multiannual Financial
    Framework (MFF) and corresponding sectorial legislation defining spending programmes.
                                The Multiannual Financial Framework translates the EU’s political priorities
                                into financial terms over a period long enough to be effective and to provide a
     Multiannual Financial
                                coherent long-term vision for beneficiaries of EU funds and co-financing
        Framework and
                                national authorities. It sets maximum annual amounts (ceilings) for EU
    spending programmes
                                expenditure as a whole and for the main categories of expenditure
                                (headings). The sum of the ceilings of all headings gives the total ceiling of
    commitment appropriations. The Multiannual Financial Framework is adopted by unanimity indicating the
    agreement of all Member States to the objectives and the level of spending (maximum level of budget
    commitments and payments), with the consent of the European Parliament. The Commission is
    responsible for managing and implementing the EU budget and programmes adopted by the Parliament
    and the Council. Most of the actual implementation and spending (about 75%) is done by national and
    local authorities but the Commission is responsible for supervising it. The Commission handles the budget
    under the watchful eye of the European Court of Auditors. Both institutions aim to ensure sound financial
    management.

                                  The    Multiannual    Financial Framework    is   complemented      by    the
         Interinstitutional       interinstitutional agreement5 which is a political agreement between the
            agreement             European Parliament, the Council and the Commission. The purpose of this
                                  agreement, adopted in 2013 in accordance with Article 295 of the TFEU, is to

         Interinstitutional Agreement of 2 December 2013 between the European Parliament, the Council and the

implement budgetary discipline, improve the functioning of the annual budgetary procedure and
cooperation between the institutions on budgetary matters as well as to ensure sound financial
management.

                            The annual budget is prepared by the Commission and usually agreed by mid-
                            December by the European Parliament and the Council, based on the
     Annual budget          procedure of Art. 314 TFEU. According to the principle of budget equilibrium,
                            total revenue must equal total expenditure (payment appropriations) for a
                            given financial year.

The main sources of funding of the EU are own resources revenues which are complemented by other
revenues. There are three types of own resources: traditional own resources (such as custom duties and
sugar levies), the own resource based on value added tax (VAT) and the own resource based on gross
national income (GNI). Other revenues arising from the activities of the EU (e.g. competition fines)
normally represent less than 10 % of total revenue. The overall amount of own resources needed to
finance the budget is determined by total expenditure less other revenue. The total amount of own
resources cannot exceed 1.20 % of the sum of gross national income (GNI) of the Member States.

The EU's operational expenditure covers the various headings of the Multiannual Financial Framework and
takes different forms, depending on how the money is paid out and managed. The EU budget is
implemented in three management modes:

        Shared management: under this method of budget implementation, tasks are delegated to
        Member States. About 75 % of the expenditure falls under this management mode covering such
        areas as agricultural spending and structural actions.

        Direct management: this is where the budget is implemented directly by the Commission
        services.

        Indirect management: this refers to cases where the Commission confers tasks of implementation
        of the budget to third parties, such as the EU regulatory agencies or international organisations.

                            The Financial Regulation (FR) applicable to the general budget is a central act
                            in the regulatory architecture of the EU´s finances defining EU financial rules
 Financial Regulation
                            applicable to the EU budget.




2.        GOVERNANCE AND ACCOUNTABILITY IN THE EU

2.1.      INSTITUTIONAL STRUCTURE

The organisational governance of the EU consists of institutions, agencies and other EU bodies which are
listed in note 9 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements. The European Investment Bank
(EIB) and the European Investment Fund (EIF) are not included in the scope of the Financial Regulation.
The main institutions, in the sense of being responsible for drafting policies and taking decisions, are the
European Parliament, the European Council, the Council and the Commission.

The Commission is the executive of the EU and promotes its general interest. It does this by proposing
legislation; implementing EU policies; overseeing the correct implementation of the Treaties and
European law; managing the EU budget; and by representing the Union outside Europe.

The Commission's internal functioning is based on a number of key principles underpinning good
governance: clear roles and responsibilities, a strong commitment to performance management and
compliance with the legal framework, clear accountability mechanisms, a high quality and inclusive
regulatory framework, openness and transparency, and high standards of ethical behaviour.




                                                                                                               9
-----------------------Page 11 End-----------------------

                                         Annual accounts of the European Union 2017


     2.2.       THE COMMISSION'S GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE

     The European Commission has a unique governance system, with a clear distinction between political and
     administrative oversight structures and well-defined lines of responsibility and financial accountability6.
     The system is based on the Treaties and the structure has evolved to adapt to a changing environment
     and to remain in line with best practice as set out in relevant international standards7.

         •    The College of Commissioners assumes collegial political responsibility for the work of the
              Commission. Operational implementation of the budget is delegated to Directors-General and
              Heads of Service who lead the administrative structure of the Commission8.

         •    The College delegates financial management tasks to the Directors-General or Heads of Service
              who thereby become Authorising Officers by Delegation (AOD). These tasks can further be
              delegated to Directors, Heads of Unit and others, who thereby become Authorising Officers by
              Sub-Delegation. The responsibility of the Authorising Officers covers the entire management
              process, from determining what needs to be done to achieve the policy objectives set by the
              institution to managing the activities from both an operational and budgetary standpoint.

     In the Commission, the roles and responsibilities in financial management are thus clearly defined and
     applied. This is a decentralised approach with clear responsibilities with the aim of creating an
     administrative culture that encourages civil servants to take responsibility for activities over which they
     have control and to give them control over the activities for which they are responsible.

     Within the context of the Commission's Strategic Planning and Programming cycle, each authorising
     officer is required to prepare an "annual activity report" (AAR) on the activities and policy achievements
     and results of the year where he/she declares that resources have been used based on the principles of
     sound financial management and that he/she has set in place control procedures which provide the
     necessary guarantee concerning the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions. At Commission
     level these results are adopted and published in an aggregated form in the Annual Management and
     Performance Report for the EU budget and sent to the European Parliament and the Council. This is the
     main instrument through which the College of Commissioners takes political responsibility for the
     management of the budget.

     The Accounting Officer of the Commission is centrally responsible for the treasury management, recovery
     procedures, laying down accounting rules based on International Public Sector Accounting Standards and
     methods, validating accounting systems and the preparation of the Commission's and consolidated
     annual accounts of the EU. Furthermore, the Accounting Officer is required to sign the annual accounts
     declaring that they present fairly, in all material aspects, the financial position, the results of the
     operations and the cash flows. The annual accounts are adopted by the College of Commissioners. The
     Accounting Officer is an independent function and bears a major responsibility as regards financial
     reporting in the Commission. The Internal Auditor of the Commission is likewise a centralised and
     independent function and provides independent advice, opinions and recommendations on the quality and
     functioning of internal control systems inside the Commission, EU agencies and other autonomous
     bodies.

     The Audit Progress Committee follows-up implementation of audits, in particular of the Internal Audit
     Service but also on the basis of European Court of Auditors audits, and assesses internal audit quality, so
     as to gain a more general view of the control systems of the Commission.

     The Corporate Management Board plays a role in the corporate governance of the Commission by
     providing oversight and strategic orientations on major corporate management issues, including in
     relation to the management of financial and human resources. Chaired by the Secretary-General, it
     brings together on a regular basis Directors-General and Cabinets responsible for budget, human
     resources and IT to ensure that the necessary organisational and technical structures are in place in the
     Commission to deliver on the political priorities of the President in an efficient and effective manner.

         As a result, the term 'European Commission' is used to denote both the institution – the College - formed by the
         Members of the Commission, and its administration managed by the Directors-General of its departments (and
         heads of other administrative structures such as services, offices and executive agencies).

2.3.     PERFORMANCE FRAMEWORK

Implementing robust performance frameworks is essential for ensuring a strong focus on results, EU
added value and sound management of EU programmes. The performance framework of the EU budget is
highly specified, scoring higher than any Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development
(OECD) country in the standard index of performance budgeting frameworks. The EU budget performance
framework reports on several types and levels of strategic goals, objectives and targets, including the
Europe 2020 strategy and other political priorities. It must also take account of the complementarity and
mainstreaming of policies and programmes and the key role of the Member States in implementing the
EU Budget.

   •   Objectives, indicators and targets are strongly featured in the programmes' legal basis and every
       year the Commission reports on them through the Programme Statements that accompany the
       draft budget. They provide all of the key information that is necessary for careful programme
       scrutiny and performance measurement: this includes 7-year financial commitments; programme
       performance baselines (starting points for policy action); end-goals (to be achieved at the end of
       the multi-annual programming period); and intermediate milestones.

   •   To ensure resources are allocated to priorities and that every action brings high performance and
       added value, the Commission implements its EU Budget Focused on Results initiative.
       Building on the 2014–2020 performance framework, it promotes a better balance between
       compliance and performance.

   •   The Annual Management and Performance Report for the EU budget provides a
       comprehensive overview on the performance, management and protection of the EU budget. It
       explains how the EU budget supports the European Union’s political priorities, the results
       achieved with the EU budget, and the role the Commission plays in ensuring and promoting the
       highest standards of budgetary and financial management.

   •   The European Court of Auditors takes a systematic and thorough approach to assessing the
       qualitative aspects of budgeting, including the performance dimension, as a normal part of its
       annual reporting and through special reports.

All of these elements place the budget authority in a strong position to take performance into account as
a significant factor in deciding on the next annual budget.


2.4.     FINANCIAL REPORTING

The main element of EU financial reporting is the Integrated Financial Reporting Package of the EU
which comprises the consolidated annual accounts of the EU, the Annual Management and Performance
Report for the budget and the Report on the follow-up to the discharge. The Integrated Financial
Reporting Package provides the public with a comprehensive view of the financial and operational
situation of the EU each year.

The consolidated annual accounts of the EU provide financial information on the activities of the
institutions, agencies and other bodies of the EU from both an accrual accounting and budgetary
perspective. These accounts do not comprise the annual accounts of Member States.

The consolidated annual accounts of the EU consist of two separate but linked parts:

       a)      the consolidated financial statements; and

       b)      the reports on implementation of the budget, which provide an aggregated record of
               budget implementation.

In addition, the consolidated annual accounts of the EU are accompanied by a Financial Statement
Discussion and Analysis (FSDA) which summarises significant changes and trends in the financial
statements and explains significant risks and uncertainties the EU has faced and needs to address in
future.




                                                                                                            11

     2.5.        EXTERNAL AUDIT AND DISCHARGE PROCEDURE

     External audit
     The European Court of Auditors (the Court) is the external auditor of the EU institutions (and bodies).
     The Court's mission is to contribute to improving EU financial management, promote accountability and
     transparency, and act as the independent guardian of the financial interests of the citizens of the EU. The
     Court’s role as the EU’s independent external auditor is to check that EU funds are correctly accounted
     for, are raised and spent in accordance with the relevant rules and regulations and have achieved value
     for money.

     The EU’s annual accounts and its sound financial management are audited by the Court, which, as part of
     its activities, draws up for the European Parliament and the Council:

     (1)     an annual report on the activities financed from the general budget, detailing its observations on
             the annual accounts and underlying transactions;
     (2)     an opinion, based on its audits and given in the annual report in the form of a statement of
             assurance, on (i) the reliability of the accounts and (ii) the legality and regularity of the
             underlying transactions involving both revenue collected and payments to final beneficiaries; and
     (3)     special reports covering specific areas.

     Discharge

     The final step of a budget lifecycle is the discharge procedure for a given financial year. It represents the
     political dimension of the external control of budget implementation and is the decision by which the
     "Discharge Authority" (i.e. the European Parliament, acting on a Council recommendation) "releases" the
     Commission (and other EU bodies) from its responsibility for the management of a given budget. This
     decision is based on an examination of the EU consolidated annual accounts and a set of Commission
     reports (the Annual Management and Performance Report, the report on the follow-up to the previous
     year's discharge and the annual report to the discharge authority on internal audits carried out) as well
     as on the European Court of Auditors' Annual Report, audit opinion (the "Statement of Assurance") and
     Special Reports. It also takes account of the Commission written replies to questions and further
     information requests as well as hearings of the Budget Commissioner and Commissioners responsible for
     the main spending areas before the European Parliament's Budgetary Control Committee (CONT).

     The outcome of the discharge procedure may be threefold: granting, postponement or refusal of the
     discharge. The final discharge reports also include specific requests addressed to the Commission by both
     the European Parliament and the Council. These requests are subject to a follow up report in which the
     Commission outlines the concrete actions it has already taken or intends to take.

NOTE ACCOMPANYING THE
CONSOLIDATED ACCOUNTS


The consolidated annual accounts of the European Union for the year 2017 have been prepared on the
basis of the information presented by the institutions and bodies under Article 148(2) of the Financial
Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Union. I hereby declare that they were
prepared in accordance with Title IX of this Financial Regulation and with the accounting principles, rules
and methods set out in the notes to the financial statements.

I have obtained from the accounting officers of these institutions and bodies, who certified its reliability,
all the information necessary for the production of the accounts that show the European Union's assets
and liabilities and the budgetary implementation.

I hereby certify that based on this information, and on such checks as I deemed necessary to sign off the
accounts of the European Commission, I have a reasonable assurance that the accounts present fairly, in
all material aspects, the financial position, the results of the operations and the cashflows of the
European Union.




                                                                     [signed]

HIGHLIGHTS OF THE FINANCIAL YEAR
2017
Implementation of the 2017 Union budget
The 2017 adopted budget focused on two main policy priorities for Europe: supporting the ongoing
recovery of the European economy and addressing the security and humanitarian challenges in our
neighbourhood. Increased funding went to investments in growth, jobs and competitiveness in the
European Union as well as to securing the necessary resources to protect the external borders of the EU,
to reinforce security inside and outside the Union, to provide support for the reception and integration of
refugees, and to address the root causes of migration in the countries of origin and transit.

The implementation of the EU budget in 2017 totalled EUR 171.1 billion in commitment appropriations,
and EUR 137.4 billion in payment appropriations.

Nearly half of the funds – EUR 83.3 billion in commitments – stimulated growth, employment and
competitiveness. This included funding for research and innovation under Horizon 2020, education
under Erasmus+, small and medium sized enterprises under the COSME programme, the Connecting
Europe Facility (CEF), the guarantee fund for the European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI) which
is the vehicle behind the Investment Plan for Europe, and to foster convergence among Member States
and among regions through the European Structural and Investment Funds (ESIF). Moreover, the EU
budget support to European farmers amounted to EUR 44.7 billion in payments.

The budget was also used to reinforce the external borders of the Union and address the refugee
crisis and irregular migration by funding stronger tools to prevent migrant smuggling and address the
long-term drivers of migration in cooperation with countries of origin and transit, stronger policies for
legal migration, including resettlement for persons in need of protection, and instruments to support
Member States with respect to the integration of refugees inside the EU.


The United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union
Background

On 23 June 2016 a majority of the citizens of the United Kingdom who voted in the referendum on
membership of the European Union voted to leave the EU. On 29 March 2017 the United Kingdom
formally notified the European Council of its intention to leave the EU and the European Atomic Energy
Community (Euratom). In doing so it triggered Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union, which sets out
the procedure for a Member State to withdraw from the Union.

The negotiation process

At a special meeting of the European Council on 29 April 2017 the leaders of the other 27 Member States
adopted political guidelines on the orderly withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the EU. These defined
the framework for the negotiations and set out the EU’s overall positions and principles. Four days later
the Commission sent a Recommendation to the Council to open Article 50 negotiations with the United
Kingdom, including draft negotiating directives.

On 22 May the Council adopted a Decision authorising the opening of negotiations with the United
Kingdom and formally nominating the Commission as the EU’s negotiator. It also adopted the first set of
negotiating directives. These provided for a clear structure and a united EU approach to the negotiations.

The EU is represented by Michel Barnier, who was appointed as Chief Negotiator by the European
Commission. Within the European Commission, a Task Force under the authority of Michel Barnier
coordinates the work on all of the strategic, operational, legal and financial issues related to the
negotiations. The Commission reports back to the Council throughout the negotiations, and also keeps
the European Parliament closely and regularly informed.

                                       Annual accounts of the European Union 2017

     The first phase of negotiations

     The first phase of the talks began on 19 June 2017. It set out to provide as much clarity and legal
     certainty as possible and to settle the disentanglement of the United Kingdom from the EU.

     Six negotiating rounds were held during 2017. Negotiations focused on three priority issues: protecting
     citizens’ rights; the framework for addressing the unique circumstances in Ireland and Northern Ireland;
     and the financial settlement to ensure that both the EU and the United Kingdom respect their financial
     obligations undertaken before the withdrawal. In addition, the negotiations covered other separation
     issues.

     On 8 December 2017 the European Commission recommended to the European Council to conclude that
     sufficient progress had been made in the first phase of the Article 50 negotiations with the United
     Kingdom. The Commission’s assessment was based on a Joint Report agreed by the negotiators of the
     Commission and the UK government. In this Joint Report, the UK agreed to pay all its obligations under
     the current Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) and previous financial perspectives as if it were still a
     Member State, including its share of the Union's liabilities and contingent liabilities.

     On 15 December the European Council confirmed that sufficient progress had been achieved, and the
     leaders adopted guidelines to move to the second phase of negotiations, on possible transitional
     arrangements and the future relationship between the EU and the United Kingdom.

     The next phase of negotiations

     On 20 December 2017 the European Commission sent a Recommendation to the Council to begin
     discussions on the next phase of negotiations, including draft negotiating directives. These supplement
     the negotiating directives from May 2017 and set out additional details on possible transitional
     arrangements.

     The Recommendation also recalls the need to translate into legal terms the results of the first phase of
     the negotiations, as outlined in the Commission’s Communication and the Joint Report. In line with the
     European Council’s guidelines of 15 December, the additional negotiating directives on transitional
     arrangements were adopted on 29 January 2018.

     On 19 March 2018 the Commission published a draft of the Withdrawal Agreement that outlined the
     progress made in the negotiation round with the UK of 16-19 March 2018. In the financial settlement part
     of the Withdrawal Agreement, the EU and the UK translated the progress achieved in the first phase of
     negotiations (presented in the Joint Report) into a legal text.

     Following the publication of the draft Withdrawal Agreement, on 23 March 2018 the European Council
     issued further guidelines with a view to the opening of negotiations on the overall understanding of the
     framework for the future EU-UK relationship. Negotiations should be completed by autumn 2018 in order
     to allow enough time before 29 March 2019 for the Withdrawal Agreement to be concluded by the
     Council, after obtaining the consent of the European Parliament, and to be approved by the United
     Kingdom in accordance with its own procedures.


     Financial settlement and the 2017 EU annual accounts

     With regard to the financial settlement, it was stated in the Joint Report, confirmed by the publication of
     the draft Withdrawal Agreement on 19 March, that the UK would pay all its obligations under the current
     MFF and previous financial perspectives as if it were still a Member State. More specifically, the draft
     withdrawal agreement states that the United Kingdom shall in particular be liable to the Union for its
     share of:

         •   The budgetary commitments of the Union budget and of the budgets of the Union decentralised
             agencies outstanding on 31 December 2020 – see Article 133 of the Withdrawal Agreement;

         •   The financing of the Union's liabilities incurred until 31 December 2020, with certain exceptions –
             see Article 135;

         •   The contingent financial liabilities of the Union arising from financial operations decided/approved
             before the withdrawal date – see Article 136; and




16                                                        16
-----------------------Page 18 End-----------------------

                                Annual accounts of the European Union 2017

   •   The payments required to discharge the contingent liabilities of the Union that become due
       related to legal cases concerning financial interests of the Union (provided that the facts forming
       the subject matter of those cases occurred no later than 31 December 2020) – see Article 140.

This is the most recent information available at the time of preparation of these accounts. Based on this
current situation, there is no impact on the consolidated EU annual accounts at 31 December 2017
resulting from the withdrawal process.

It is also noted that the Commission has proposed on 2 May 2018 its proposal for the next MFF starting in
2021 which is prepared on the basis that the UK will no longer be a Member State.




                                                                                                             17

                                       Annual accounts of the European Union 2017


     1.         SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES


     1.1.       LEGAL BASIS AND ACCOUNTING RULES

     The accounts of the EU are kept in accordance with Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012 of the
     European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2012 on the financial rules applicable to the
     general budget of the Union and repealing Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 (OJ L 298,
     26 October 2012, p. 1) hereinafter referred to as the 'Financial Regulation' and Commission Delegated
     Regulation (EU) No 1268/2012 of 29 October 2012 (OJ L 362, 31 December 2012, p. 1) laying down
     detailed rules of application of this Financial Regulation.

     In accordance with article 143 of the Financial Regulation, the EU prepares its financial statements on the
     basis of accrual-based accounting rules that are based on International Public Sector Accounting
     Standards (IPSAS). These accounting rules, adopted by the Accounting Officer of the Commission, have
     to be applied by all the institutions and EU bodies falling within the scope of consolidation in order to
     establish a uniform set of rules for accounting, valuation and presentation of the accounts with a view to
     harmonising the process for drawing up the financial statements and consolidation.

     Application of new and amended European Union accounting rules (EAR)

     Amendments to EAR which are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2017

     The following amendments have been adopted by the Accounting Officer of the Commission:

          •   Amendments to EAR 1 "Financial Statements"; and

          •   Amendments to EAR 14 "Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors".

        These amendments stem from the recent changes to IPSAS 1 "Presentation of Financial Statements"
        and IPSAS 3 "Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors", proposing
        improvements to ensure consistency among IPSAS standards. Consequently, the related EARs have
        been updated and the main changes relate to the description of qualitative characteristics of financial
        reporting and updates to the hierarchy of sources to be used in the selection and application of
        accounting policies.

     The adoption of these amendments has had no impact on the EU annual accounts 2017.

     New and revised EARs adopted but not yet effective at 31 December 2017

     The EU has not applied the following new and revised EARs, which have been adopted by the Accounting
     Officer of the Commission, but which are not yet effective:

          •   Revision to EAR 12 "Employee Benefits" (effective for annual           periods beginning on or after
              1 January 2018): The EAR 12 has been revised in line with             the new IPSAS 39 "Employee
              Benefits". The main change is that any gain or loss resulting          from changes in the actuarial
              assumptions is to be recognised directly in net assets, in contrast   with the current requirement to
              recognise them in surplus or deficit.

        The EU is currently analysing the impact and practical consequences of applying this revised EAR.
        However, no significant impact is expected on the consolidated financial statements, except for the
        recognition of the actuarial assumptions in the net assets instead of the statement of financial
        performance.

          •   New EAR 20 "Public Sector Combinations" (effective for annual periods beginning on or after
              1 January 2019): The EAR 20, which is based on the IPSAS 40 "Public Sector Combinations",
              establishes the classification of a public sector combination into two different types depending on
              whether the transaction takes place under common control or not: (i) amalgamation, in which the
              transaction is based on the carrying amounts of the entity combined with the EU; and (ii)
              acquisition, in which the transaction is based on the acquisition date fair values of the entity

                                  Annual accounts of the European Union 2017

        acquired by the EU. Both have distinct requirements and levels of disclosure, in order to provide a
        better understanding of its effects to users of the financial statements of the EU.

   The impact on the EU financial statements in the year of initial application will depend on whether in
   that period the EU would enter into a public sector combination transaction.


1.2.      ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES

The objective of financial statements is to provide information about the financial position, performance
and cashflows of an entity that is useful to a wide range of users. For the EU as a public sector entity, the
objectives are more specifically to provide information useful for decision making, and to demonstrate the
accountability of the entity for the resources entrusted to it. It is with these goals in mind that the
present document has been drawn up.

The overall considerations (or accounting principles) to be followed when preparing the financial
statements are laid down in EU accounting rule 1 "Financial Statements" and are the same as those
described in IPSAS 1: fair presentation, accrual basis, going concern, consistency of presentation,
materiality, aggregation, offsetting and comparative information. The qualitative characteristics of
financial reporting are relevance, faithful representation (reliability), understandability, timeliness,
comparability and verifiability.


1.3.      CONSOLIDATION

Scope of consolidation

The consolidated financial statements of the EU comprise all significant controlled entities (i.e. the EU
institutions (including the Commission) and the EU agencies), associates and joint ventures. The
complete list of consolidated entities can be found in note 9 of the EU financial statements. It now
comprises 52 controlled entities and 1 associate. Entities that fall under the consolidation scope, but
which are immaterial to the EU consolidated financial statements as a whole, need not be consolidated or
accounted for using equity method where to do so would result in excessive time or cost to the EU. Those
entities are referred to as 'Minor entities' and are separately listed in note 9. In 2017, 7 entities have
been classified as minor entities.

Controlled entities

The decision to include an entity in the scope of consolidation is based on the control concept. Controlled
entities are all entities for which the EU is exposed, or has right, to variable benefits from its involvement
and has the ability to affect the nature and amount of those benefits through its power over the other
entity. This power must be presently exercisable and must relate to the relevant activities of the entity.
Controlled entities are fully consolidated. The consolidation begins at the first date on which control
exists, and ends when such control no longer exists.

The most common indicators of control within the EU are: creation of the entity through founding treaties
or secondary legislation, financing of the entity from the EU budget, the existence of voting rights in the
governing bodies, audit by the European Court of Auditors and discharge by the European Parliament. An
individual assessment for each entity is made in order to decide whether one or all of the criteria listed
above are sufficient to result in control.

Under this approach, the EU's institutions (except the European Central Bank) and agencies (excluding
the agencies of the former 2nd pillar) are considered as under the exclusive control of the EU and are
therefore included in the consolidation scope. Furthermore the European Coal and Steel Community
(ECSC) in Liquidation is also considered as a controlled entity.

All material "inter-entity transactions and balances" between EU controlled entities are eliminated, while
unrealised gains and losses on such transactions are not material and so have not been eliminated.

Joint Arrangements

A joint arrangement is an agreement over which the EU and one or more parties have joint control. Joint
control is contractually agreed sharing of control over an arrangement, which exists only when decisions


                                                                                                                 29
-----------------------Page 31 End-----------------------

                                       Annual accounts of the European Union 2017

     about the relevant activities require the unanimous consent of parties sharing control. Joint agreements
     can be either joint operations or joint ventures. In case a joint arrangement is structured through a
     separate vehicle and parties to the joint arrangement have rights to the net assets of the arrangement,
     this joint arrangement classifies as a joint venture. Participations in joint ventures are accounted for
     using the equity method (see note 1.5.4). In case the parties have rights to the assets, and obligations
     for the liabilities, related to the arrangement, this joint arrangement is classified as a joint operation. In
     relation to its interest in joint operations, the EU recognises in its financial statements: its assets and
     liabilities, revenue and expense, as well as its share of assets, liabilities, revenue and expense held or
     incurred jointly.

     Associates

     Associates are entities over which the EU has, directly or indirectly, significant influence but not control.
     It is presumed that significant influence exists if the EU holds directly or indirectly 20 % or more of the
     voting rights. Participations in associates are accounted for using the equity method (see note 1.5.4).

     Non-consolidated entities the funds of which are managed by the Commission

     The funds of the Joint Sickness Insurance Scheme for staff of the EU, the European Development Fund
     and the Participants Guarantee Fund are managed by the Commission on their behalf. However, since
     these entities are not controlled by the EU, they are not consolidated in its financial statements.


     1.4.       BASIS OF PREPARATION

     Financial statements are presented annually. The accounting year begins on 1 January and ends on
     31 December.


     1.4.1.     Currency and basis for conversion

     Functional and reporting currency

     The financial statements are presented in millions of euros, unless stated otherwise, the euro being the
     EU's functional and reporting currency.

     Transactions and balances

     Foreign currency transactions are translated into euros using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates
     of the transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of foreign currency
     transactions and from the re-translation at year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities
     denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the statement of financial performance. Translation
     differences on non-monetary financial instruments classified as available for sale financial assets are
     included in the fair value reserve.

     Different conversion methods apply to property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, which retain
     their value in euros at the rate that applied at the date when they were purchased.

     Year-end balances of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are converted into
     euros on the basis of the European Central Bank (ECB) exchange rates applying on 31 December:

1.4.2.    Use of estimates

In accordance with IPSAS and generally accepted accounting principles, the financial statements
necessarily include amounts based on estimates and assumptions by management based on the most
reliable information available. Significant estimates include, but are not limited to: amounts for employee
benefit liabilities, provisions, financial risk on inventories and accounts receivable, accrued revenue and
charges, contingent assets and liabilities, degree of impairment of intangible assets and property, plant
and equipment and amounts disclosed in the notes concerning financial instruments. Actual results could
differ from those estimates. Changes in estimates are reflected in the period in which they become
known.


1.5.      BALANCE SHEET

1.5.1.    Intangible assets

Acquired computer software licences are stated at historical cost less accumulated amortisation and
impairment losses. The assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives
(3-11 years). The estimated useful lives of intangible assets depend on their specific economic lifetime or
legal lifetime determined by an agreement. Internally developed intangible assets are capitalised when
the relevant criteria of the EU accounting rules are met and the expenses relate solely to the
development phase of the asset. The costs capitalisable include all directly attributable costs necessary to
create, produce, and prepare the asset to be capable of operating in the manner intended by
management. Costs associated with research activities, non-capitalisable development costs and
maintenance costs are recognised as expenses as incurred.


1.5.2.    Property, plant and equipment

All property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and
impairment losses. Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition, construction
or transfer of the asset.

Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as
appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits or service potential associated with
the item will flow to the EU and its cost can be measured reliably. Repairs and maintenance costs are
charged to the statement of financial performance during the financial period in which they are incurred.

Land and works of art are not depreciated as they are deemed to have an indefinite useful life. Assets
under construction are not depreciated as these assets are not yet available for use. Depreciation on
other assets is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate their cost less their residual values
over their estimated useful lives, as follows:

Type of asset                                                           Straight line depreciation rate
Buildings                                                                      4 % to 10 %
Space assets                                                                   8 % to 25 %
Plant and equipment                                                            10 % to 25 %
Furniture and vehicles                                                         10 % to 25 %
Computer hardware                                                              25 % to 33 %
Other                                                                          10 % to 33 %

Gains or losses on disposals are determined by comparing proceeds less selling expenses with the
carrying amount of the disposed asset and are included in the statement of financial performance.

Leases

Leases of tangible assets, where the EU has substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership, are
classified as finance leases. Finance leases are capitalised at the inception of the lease’s commencement
at the lower of the fair value of the leased asset and the present value of the minimum lease payments.
The interest element of the finance lease payment is charged to expenditure over the period of the lease
at a constant periodic rate in relation to the balance outstanding. The rental obligations, net of finance
charges, are included in financial liabilities (non-current and current). The interest element of the finance


                                                                                                                31
-----------------------Page 33 End-----------------------

                                       Annual accounts of the European Union 2017

     cost is charged to the statement of financial performance over the lease period so as to produce a
     constant periodic interest rate on the remaining balance of the liability for each period. The assets held
     under finance leases are depreciated over the shorter of the asset's useful life and the lease term.

     Leases where the lessor retains a significant portion of the risks and rewards inherent to ownership are
     classified as operating leases. Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense in the statement
     of financial performance on a straight-line basis over the lease term.


     1.5.3.    Impairment of non-financial assets

     Assets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortisation/depreciation and are tested
     annually for impairment. Assets that are subject to amortisation/depreciation are reviewed for
     impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be
     recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount
     exceeds its recoverable (service) amount. The recoverable (service) amount is the higher of an asset’s
     fair value less costs to sell and its value in use.

     Intangible assets and property, plant and equipment residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and
     adjusted if appropriate, at least once per year. An asset’s carrying amount is written down immediately
     to its recoverable (service) amount if the asset’s carrying amount is greater than its estimated
     recoverable (service) amount. If the reasons for impairments recognised in previous years no longer
     apply, the impairment losses are reversed accordingly.


     1.5.4.    Investments accounted for using the equity method

     Participations in associates and joint ventures

     Investments accounted for using the equity method are initially recognised at cost. The EU's interest in
     these investments is recognised in the statement of financial performance, and its share in the
     movements in reserves is recognised in the fair value reserve in net assets. The initial cost together with
     all movements (further contributions, share of economic results and reserve movements, impairments,
     and dividends) give the book value of the investment in the financial statements at the balance sheet
     date. Distributions received from the investment reduce the carrying amount of the asset.

     If the EU's share of deficits of an investment accounted for using the equity method equals or exceeds its
     interest in the investment, the EU discontinues recognising its share of further losses ("unrecognised
     losses"). After the EU's interest is reduced to zero, additional losses are provided for and a liability is
     recognised, only to the extent that the EU has incurred legal or constructive obligation or made payments
     on behalf of the entity.

     If there are indications of impairment, a write-down to the lower recoverable amount is necessary. The
     recoverable amount is determined as described under note 1.5.3. If the reason for impairment ceases to
     apply at a later date, the impairment loss is reversed to the carrying amount that would have been
     determined had no impairment loss been recognised.

     In cases where the EU holds 20 % or more of an investment capital fund, it does not seek to exert
     significant influence. Such funds are therefore treated as financial instruments and categorised as
     available for sale financial assets.

     Associates and joint ventures classified as minor entities are not accounted for under the equity method.
     EU contributions to those entities are accounted for as an expense of the period.


     1.5.5.    Financial assets

     Classification

     The EU classifies their financial assets in the following categories: financial assets at fair value through
     surplus or deficit; loans and receivables; held-to-maturity investments; and available for sale financial
     assets. The classification of financial instruments is determined at initial recognition and re-evaluated at
     each balance sheet date.

                                   Annual accounts of the European Union 2017

    (i) Financial assets at fair value through surplus or deficit

A financial asset is classified in this category if acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the short
term. Derivatives are also categorised in this category. Assets in this category are classified as current
assets if they are expected to be realised within 12 months of the balance sheet date.

    (ii) Loans and receivables

Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are
not quoted in an active market. They arise when the EU provides money, goods or services directly to a
debtor with no intention of trading the receivable, or in case the EU is subrogated to the rights of the
original lender following a payment made by the EU under a guarantee contract. Payments due within 12
months of the balance sheet date are classified as current assets. Payments due after 12 months from
the balance sheet date are classified as non-current assets. Loans and receivables include term deposits
with the original maturity above three months.

    (iii) Held-to-maturity investments

Held-to-maturity investments are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments
and fixed maturities that the EU has the positive intention and ability to hold to maturity. During this
financial year, the EU did not hold any investments in this category.

    (iv) Available for sale financial assets

Available for sale financial assets are non-derivatives that are either designated in this category or not
classified in any of the other categories. They are classified as either current or non-current assets,
depending on the period of time the EU expects to hold them. Investments in entities that are neither
consolidated nor accounted for using the equity method and other equity-type investments (e.g. Risk
Capital Operations) are also classified as available for sale financial assets.

Initial recognition and measurement

Purchases and sales of financial assets at fair value through surplus or deficit, held-to-maturity and
available for sale are recognised on trade-date – the date on which the EU commits to purchase or sell
the asset. Cash equivalents and loans are recognised when cash is advanced to the borrowers. Financial
instruments are initially recognised at fair value. For all financial assets not carried at fair value through
surplus or deficit transactions costs are added to the fair value at initial recognition. Financial assets
carried at fair value through surplus or deficit are initially recognised at fair value and transaction costs
are expensed in the statement of financial performance.

The fair value of a financial asset on initial recognition is normally the transaction price (i.e. the fair value
of the consideration received), unless the fair value of that instrument is evidenced by comparison with
other observable current market transactions in the same instrument or based on a valuation technique
whose variables include only data from observable markets (e.g. in case of some derivative contracts).
However, when a long-term loan that carries no interest or an interest below market conditions is
granted, its fair value can be estimated as the present value of all future cash receipts discounted using
the prevailing market rate of interest for a similar instrument with a similar credit rating.

Loans granted are measured at their nominal amount, which is considered to be the fair value of the
loan. The reasoning for this is as follows:

    •   The “market environment” for EU lending is very specific and different from the capital market
        used to issue commercial or government bonds. As lenders in these markets have the
        opportunity to choose alternative investments, the opportunity possibility is factored into market
        prices. However, this opportunity for alternative investments does not exist for the EU which is
        not allowed to invest money on the capital markets; it only borrows funds for the purpose of
        lending at the same rate. This means that there is no alternative lending or investment option
        available to the EU for the sums borrowed. Thus, there is no opportunity cost and therefore no
        basis of comparison with market rates. In fact, the EU lending operation itself represents the
        market. Essentially, since the opportunity cost "option" is not applicable, the market price does
        not fairly reflect the substance of the EU lending transactions. Therefore, it is not appropriate to
        determine the fair value of EU lending with reference to commercial or government bonds.




                                                                                                                    33
-----------------------Page 35 End-----------------------

                                        Annual accounts of the European Union 2017

         •    Furthermore as there is no active market or similar transactions to compare with, the interest
              rate to be used by the EU for fair valuing its lending operations under the EFSM, BOP and other
              such loans, should be the interest rate charged.

         •    In addition, for these loans, there are compensating effects between loans and borrowings due to
              their back-to-back character. Thus, the effective interest for the loan equals the effective interest
              rate for the related borrowings. The transaction costs incurred by the EU and then recharged to
              the beneficiary of the loan are directly recognised in the statement of financial performance.

     Financial instruments are derecognised when the rights to receive cashflows from the investments have
     expired or the EU has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership to another party.

     Subsequent measurement

         a) Financial assets at fair value through surplus or deficit are subsequently carried at fair value.
            Gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of the ‘financial instruments at fair value
            through surplus or deficit’ category are included in the statement of financial performance in the
            period in which they arise.

         b) Loans and receivables are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method. In the
            case of loans granted on borrowed funds, the same effective interest rate is applied to both the
            loans and borrowings since these loans have the characteristics of 'back-to-back operations' and
            the differences between the loan and the borrowing conditions and amounts are not material. The
            transaction costs incurred by the EU and then recharged to the beneficiary of the loan are directly
            recognised in the statement of financial performance.

         c)   Held to maturity assets are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method. The EU
              currently holds no held to maturity investments.

         d) Available for sale financial assets are subsequently carried at fair value. Gains and losses arising
            from changes in the fair value of available for sale financial assets are recognised in the fair value
            reserve, except for translation differences on monetary assets which are recognised in the
            statement of financial performance. When assets classified as available for sale financial assets
            are derecognised or impaired, the cumulative fair value adjustments previously recognised in the
            fair value reserve are recognised in the statement of financial performance. Interest on available
            for sale financial assets calculated using the effective interest method is recognised in the
            statement of financial performance. Dividends on available for sale equity instruments are
            recognised when the EU's right to receive payment is established.

     The fair values of quoted investments in active markets are based on current bid prices. If the market for
     a financial asset is not active (and for unlisted securities and over-the–counter derivatives), the EU
     establishes a fair value by using valuation techniques. These include the use of recent arm’s length
     transactions, reference to other instruments that are substantially the same, discounted cashflow
     analysis, option pricing models and other valuation techniques commonly used by market participants.

     Investments in Venture Capital Funds, classified as available for sale financial assets, which do not have a
     quoted market price in an active market are valued at the attributable net asset value, which is
     considered as an equivalent of their fair value.

     In cases where the fair value of investments in equity instruments that do not have a quoted market
     price in an active market cannot be reliably measured, these investments are valued at cost less
     impairment losses.

     Impairment of financial assets

     The EU assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset is
     impaired. A financial asset is impaired and impairment losses are incurred if, and only if, there is
     objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial
     recognition of the asset and that loss event (or events) has an impact on the estimated future cashflows
     of the financial asset that can be reliably estimated.

     (a) Assets carried at amortised cost

     If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss on loans and receivables or held-to-maturity
     investments carried at amortised cost has been incurred, the amount of the loss is measured as the

34
-----------------------Page 36 End-----------------------

                                   Annual accounts of the European Union 2017

difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cashflows
(excluding future credit losses that have not been incurred) discounted at the financial asset’s original
effective interest rate. The carrying amount of the asset is reduced and the amount of the loss is
recognised in the statement of financial performance. If a loan or held-to-maturity investment has a
variable interest rate, the discount rate for measuring any impairment loss is the current effective
interest rate determined under the contract. The calculation of the present value of the estimated future
cashflows of a collateralised financial asset reflects the cashflows that may result from foreclosure less
costs for obtaining and selling the collateral, whether or not foreclosure is probable. If, in a subsequent
period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an
event occurring after the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised impairment loss is
reversed through the statement of financial performance.

(b) Assets carried at fair value

In the case of equity investments classified as available for sale financial assets, a significant or
permanent (prolonged) decline in the fair value of the security below its cost is considered in determining
whether the securities are impaired. If any such evidence exists for available for sale financial assets, the
cumulative loss – measured as the difference between the acquisition cost and the current fair value, less
any impairment loss on that financial asset previously recognised in the statement of financial
performance – is removed from reserves and recognised in the statement of financial performance.
Impairment losses recognised in the statement of financial performance on equity instruments are not
reversed through the statement of financial performance. If, in a subsequent period, the fair value of a
debt instrument classified as available for sale financial asset increases and the increase can be
objectively related to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised, the impairment loss is
reversed through the statement of financial performance.


1.5.6.    Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is determined using the first-in,
first-out (FIFO) method. The cost of finished goods and work in progress comprises raw materials, direct
labour, other directly attributable costs and related production overheads (based on normal operating
capacity). Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the
costs of completion and selling expenses. When inventories are held for distribution at no charge or for a
nominal charge, they are measured at the lower of cost and current replacement cost. Current
replacement cost is the cost the EU would incur to acquire the asset on the reporting date.


1.5.7.    Pre-financing amounts

Pre-financing is a payment intended to provide the beneficiary with a cash advance, i.e. a float. It may be
split into a number of payments over a period defined in the particular contract, decision, agreement or
basic legal act. The float or advance is either used for the purpose for which it was provided during the
period defined in the agreement or it is repaid. If the beneficiary does not incur eligible expenditure, they
have the obligation to return the pre-financing advance to the EU. The amount of the pre-financing may
be reduced (wholly or partially) by the acceptance of eligible costs (which are recognised as expenses).

Pre-financing is, on subsequent balance sheet dates, measured at the amount initially recognised on the
balance sheet less eligible expenses (including estimated amounts where necessary) incurred during the
period.

Interest on pre-financing is recognised as it is earned in accordance with the provisions of the relevant
agreement. An estimate of the accrued interest revenue, based on the most reliable information, is made
at the year-end and included on the balance sheet.

Other advances to Member States which originate from reimbursement by the EU of amounts paid as
advances by the Member States to their beneficiaries (including "financial instruments under shared
management") are recognised as assets and presented under the pre-financing heading. Other advances
to Member States are subsequently measured at the amount initially recognised on the balance sheet
less a best estimate of the eligible expenses incurred by final beneficiaries, calculated on the basis of
reasonable and supportable assumptions.

The EU contributions to the trust funds of the European Development Fund or other unconsolidated
entities are also classified as pre-financing since their purpose is to give a float to the trust fund to allow
it to finance specific actions defined under the trust fund's objectives. The EU contributions to trust funds

                                                                                                                  35
-----------------------Page 37 End-----------------------

                                       Annual accounts of the European Union 2017

     are measured at the initial amount of the EU contribution less eligible expenses, including estimated
     amounts where necessary, incurred by the trust fund during the reporting period and allocated to the EU
     contribution in accordance with the underlying agreement.


     1.5.8.    Exchange receivables and non-exchange recoverables

     As the EU accounting rules require a separate presentation of exchange and non-exchange transactions,
     for the purpose of drawing up the accounts, receivables are defined as stemming from exchange
     transactions and recoverables are defined as stemming from non-exchange transactions, i.e. when the
     EU receives value from another entity without directly giving approximately equal value in exchange (for
     example recoverables from Member States related to own resources).

     Receivables from exchange transactions meet the definition of financial instruments and are thus
     classified as loans and receivables and measured accordingly (see note 1.5.5). The financial instruments
     notes disclosures concerning receivables from exchange transactions include accrued revenue and
     deferred charges from exchange transactions as they are not material.

     Recoverables from non-exchange transactions are carried at original amount (adjusted for interest and
     penalties) less write-down for impairment. A write-down for impairment of recoverables from
     non-exchange transactions is established when there is objective evidence that the EU will not be able to
     collect all amounts due according to the original terms of recoverables from non-exchange transactions.
     The amount of the write-down is the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the recoverable
     amount. The amount of the write-down is recognised in the statement of financial performance. A general
     write-down, based on past experience, is also made for outstanding recovery orders not already subject
     to a specific write-down. See note 1.5.14 concerning the treatment of accrued revenue at year-end.
     Amounts displayed and disclosed as recoverables from non-exchanges transactions are not financial
     instruments as they do not arise from a contract that would give rise to a financial liability or equity
     instrument. However, in the notes to the financial statements recoverables from non-exchange
     transactions are disclosed together with receivables from exchange transactions where appropriate.


     1.5.9.    Cash and cash equivalents

     Cash and cash equivalents are financial instruments and include cash at hand, deposits held at call or at
     short notice with banks and other short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three
     months or less.


     1.5.10. Pension and other employee benefits

     Pension obligations

     The EU operates defined benefit pension plans. Whilst staff contribute from their salaries one third of the
     expected cost of these benefits, the liability is not funded. The liability recognised in the balance sheet in
     respect of defined benefit pension plans is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the
     balance sheet date less the fair value of any plan assets. The defined benefit obligation is calculated by
     actuaries using the projected unit credit method. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is
     determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of government bonds
     that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity
     approximating to the terms of the related pension liability.

     Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are
     recognised immediately in the statement of financial performance. Past-service costs are recognised
     immediately in statement of financial performance, unless the changes to the pension plan are
     conditional on the employees remaining in service for a specified period of time (the vesting period). In
     this case, the past-service costs are amortised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.

     Post-employment sickness benefits

     The EU provides health benefits to its employees through the reimbursement of medical expenses.
     A separate fund has been created for its day-to-day administration. Both current employees, pensioners,
     widowers and their relatives benefit from the system. The benefits granted to the "inactives" (pensioners,
     orphans, etc.) are classified as "Post-Employment Employee Benefits". Given the nature of these benefits,


36
-----------------------Page 38 End-----------------------

                                   Annual accounts of the European Union 2017

an actuarial calculation is required. The liability in the balance sheet is determined on a similar basis as
that for the pension obligations (see above).


1.5.11. Provisions

Provisions are recognised when the EU has a present legal or constructive obligation towards third parties
as a result of past events, it is more likely than not that an outflow of resources will be required to settle
the obligation, and the amount can be reliably estimated. Provisions are not recognised for future
operating losses. The amount of the provision is the best estimate of the expenses expected to be
required to settle the present obligation at the reporting date. Where the provision involves a large
number of items, the obligation is estimated by weighting all possible outcomes by their associated
probabilities (“expected value” method).


1.5.12. Financial liabilities

Financial liabilities are classified as financial liabilities at fair value through surplus or deficit, financial
liabilities carried at amortised cost or as financial guarantee liabilities.

Borrowings are composed of borrowings from credit institutions and debts evidenced by certificates. They
are recognised initially at fair value, being their issue proceeds (fair value of consideration received) net
of transaction costs incurred, then subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest
method; any difference between proceeds, net of transaction costs, and the redemption value is
recognised in the statement of financial performance over the period of the borrowings using the effective
interest method. In the case of loans granted on borrowed funds, the effective interest method may not
be applied to loans and borrowings, based on materiality considerations. The transaction costs incurred
by the EU and then recharged to the beneficiary of the loan are directly recognised in the statement of
financial performance.

Financial liabilities categorised at fair value through surplus or deficit include derivatives which fair value
is negative. They follow the same accounting treatment as financial assets at fair value through surplus
or deficit, see note 1.5.5.

Financial guarantee liabilities are initially recognised at fair value, being the premium received.
Subsequently, financial guarantee liabilities are measured at the higher of the best estimate of the
expenses expected to be required to settle the financial guarantee liability and the amount initially
recognised less, when appropriate, cumulative amortisation. The EU recognises a financial guarantee
liability when it receives consideration for granting of the guarantee, that is at market terms, or when the
fair value of the guarantee can be measured reliably. In case no active market for a directly equivalent
guarantee contract exists, the EU discloses the guarantee given as a contingent liability (see note 1.7.2)
or - when it is more likely than not that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation –
the EU recognises a provision (see note 1.5.11).

Financial liabilities are classified as non-current liabilities, except for maturities less than 12 months after
the balance sheet date.

EU trust funds that are considered as part of the Commission's operational activities are accounted for in
the Commission accounts and further consolidated in the EU annual accounts. Therefore, contributions
from other donors to the EU trust funds fulfil the criteria of revenues from non-exchange transactions
under conditions and they are presented as financial liabilities until the conditions attached to the
contributions transferred are met, i.e. eligible costs are incurred by the trust fund. The trust fund is
required to finance specific projects and return remaining funds at the time of winding-up. At the balance
sheet date the outstanding contribution liabilities are measured at contributions received less the
expenses incurred by the trust fund, including estimated amounts when necessary. For reporting
purposes the net expenses are allocated to the contributions of other donors in proportion to net
contributions paid as at 31 December. This allocation of contributions is only indicative. When the trust
fund is wound up the actual split of remaining resources will be decided by the trust fund board.


1.5.13. Payables

A significant amount of the payables of the EU are unpaid cost claims from beneficiaries of grants or
other EU funding (non-exchange transactions). They are recorded as payables for the requested amount


                                                                                                                    37
-----------------------Page 39 End-----------------------

                                      Annual accounts of the European Union 2017

     when the cost claim is received. Upon verification and acceptance of the eligible costs, the payables are
     valued at the accepted and eligible amount.

     Payables arising from the purchase of goods and services are recognised at invoice reception for the
     original amount and corresponding expenses are entered in the accounts when the supplies or services
     are delivered and accepted by the EU.


     1.5.14. Accrued and deferred revenue and charges

     Transactions and events are recognised in the financial statements in the period to which they relate. At
     year-end, if an invoice is not yet issued but the service has been rendered, the supplies have been
     delivered by the EU or a contractual agreement exists (e.g. by reference to a treaty), an accrued revenue
     will be recognised in the financial statements. In addition, at year-end, if an invoice is issued but the
     services have not yet been rendered or the goods supplied have not yet been delivered, the revenue will
     be deferred and recognised in the subsequent accounting period.

     Expenses are also accounted for in the period to which they relate. At the end of the accounting period,
     accrued expenses are recognised based on an estimated amount of the transfer obligation of the period.
     The calculation of accrued expenses is done in accordance with detailed operational and practical
     guidelines issued by the Commission which aim at ensuring that the financial statements provide a
     faithful representation of the economic and other phenomena they purport to represent. By analogy, if
     payment has been made in advance for services or goods that have not yet been received, the expense
     will be deferred and recognised in the subsequent accounting period.


     1.6.     STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE

     1.6.1.   Revenue

     REVENUE FROM NON-EXCHANGE TRANSACTIONS

     The vast majority of the EU's revenue relates to non-exchange transactions:

     GNI based resources and VAT resources

     Revenue is recognised for the period for which the Commission sends out a call for funds to the Member
     States claiming their contribution. They are measured at their “called amount”. As VAT and GNI resources
     are based on estimates of the data for the budgetary year concerned, they may be revised as changes
     occur until the final data are issued by the Member States. The effect of a change in estimate is included
     when determining the net surplus or deficit for the period in which the change occurred.

     Traditional own resources

     Recoverables from non-exchange transactions and related revenues are recognised when the relevant
     monthly "A" statements (including duties collected and amounts due that are guaranteed and not
     contested) are received from the Member States. At the reporting date, revenue collected by the Member
     States for the period but not yet paid to the Commission is estimated and recognised as accrued revenue.
     The quarterly "B" statements (including duties neither collected nor guaranteed, as well as guaranteed
     amounts that have been contested by the debtor) received from the Member States are recognised as
     revenue less the collection costs to which they are entitled. In addition, a value reduction is recognised
     for the amount of the estimated recovery gap.

     Fines

     Revenue from fines is recognised when the EU's decision imposing a fine has been taken and it is
     officially notified to the addressee. If there are doubts about the undertaking's solvency, a value
     reduction on the entitlement is recognised. After the decision to impose a fine, the debtors have two
     months from the date of notification:

        a) either to accept the decision, in which case they must pay the fine within the time limit laid down
           and the amount is definitively collected by the EU;



38
-----------------------Page 40 End-----------------------

                                  Annual accounts of the European Union 2017

    b) or not to accept the decision, in which case they lodge an appeal under EU law.

However, even if appealed, the fine must be paid within the time limit of three months laid down as the
appeal does not have suspensory effect (Article 278 of the EU Treaty) or, under certain circumstances
and subject to the agreement of the Commission's Accounting Officer, the debtor may present a bank
guarantee for the amount instead.

If the undertaking appeals against the decision, and has already provisionally paid the fine, the amount is
disclosed as a contingent liability. However, since an appeal against an EU decision by the addressee
does not have suspensory effect, the cash received is used to clear the recoverable. If a guarantee is
received instead of payment, the fine remains as a recoverable. If it appears probable that the General
Court may not rule in favour of the EU, a provision is recognised to cover this risk. If a guarantee had
been given instead, then the recoverable outstanding is written-down as required. The accumulated
interest received by the Commission on the bank accounts where received payments are deposited is
recognised as revenue, and any contingent liability is increased accordingly.

Since 2010, all provisionally cashed fines are managed by the Commission in a specifically created fund
(BUFI) and invested in financial instruments.

REVENUE FROM EXCHANGE TRANSACTIONS

Revenue from the sale of goods and services is recognised when the significant risk and rewards of
ownership of the goods are transferred to the purchaser. Revenue associated with a transaction involving
the provision of services is recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the transaction at the
reporting date.

Interest revenue and expense

Interest revenue and expense are recognised in the statement of financial performance using the
effective interest method. This is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial asset or a
financial liability and of allocating the interest revenue or interest expense over the relevant period. When
calculating the effective interest rate, the EU estimates cashflows considering all contractual terms of the
financial instrument (for example prepayment options) but does not consider future credit losses. The
calculation includes all fees and points paid or received between parties to the contract that are an
integral part of the effective interest rate, transaction costs and all other premiums or discounts.

Once a financial asset or a group of similar financial assets has been written down as a result of an
impairment loss, interest revenue is recognised using the rate of interest to discount the future cashflows
for the purpose of measuring the impairment loss.

Revenue from dividends

Revenue from dividends and similar distributions is recognised when the right to receive payment is

1.6.2.    Expenses

Expenses from non-exchange transactions account for the majority of the EU's expenses. They relate to
transfers to beneficiaries and can be of three types: entitlements, transfers under agreement and
discretionary grants, contributions and donations.

Transfers are recognised as expenses in the period during which the events giving rise to the transfer
occurred, as long as the nature of the transfer is allowed by regulation (Financial Regulation, Staff
Regulations, or other regulation) or an agreement has been signed authorising the transfer; any eligibility
criteria have been met by the beneficiary; and a reasonable estimate of the amount can be made.

When a request for payment or cost claim is received and meets the recognition criteria, it is recognised
as an expense for the eligible amount. At year-end, incurred eligible expenses due to the beneficiaries
but not yet reported are estimated and recorded as accrued expenses.

Expenses from exchange transactions arising from the purchase of goods and services are recognised
when the supplies are delivered and accepted by the EU. They are valued at original invoice amount.
Furthermore, at the balance sheet date expenses related to the service delivered during the period for


                                                                                                                39

                                        Annual accounts of the European Union 2017

     which an invoice has not yet been received or accepted are estimated and recognised in the statement of
     financial performance.


     1.7.      CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES

     1.7.1.    Contingent assets

     A contingent asset is a possible asset that arises from past events and of which the existence will be
     confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly
     within the control of the EU. A contingent asset is disclosed when an inflow of economic benefits or
     service potential is probable.


     1.7.2.    Contingent liabilities

     A contingent liability is a possible obligation that arises from past events and of which the existence will
     be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly
     within the control of the EU; or a present obligation that arises from past events but is not recognised
     because: it is not probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits or service potential
     will be required to settle the obligation or in the rare circumstances where the amount of the obligation
     cannot be measured with sufficient reliability.


     1.8.      CASHFLOW STATEMENT

     Cashflow information is used to provide a basis for assessing the ability of the EU to generate cash and
     cash equivalents, and its needs to utilise those cashflows.

     The cashflow statement is prepared using the indirect method. This means that the economic result for
     the financial year is adjusted for the effects of transactions of a non-cash nature, any deferrals or
     accruals of past or future operating cash receipts or payments, and items of revenue or expense
     associated with investing cashflows.

     Cashflows arising from transactions in a foreign currency are recorded in the EU’s reporting currency
     (Euro), by applying to the foreign currency amount the exchange rate between the euro and the foreign
     currency at the date of the cashflow.

     The cashflow statement reports cashflows during the period classified by operating and investing
     activities (the EU does not have financing activities).

     Operating activities are the activities of the EU that are not investing activities. These are the majority of
     the activities performed. Loans granted to beneficiaries (and the related borrowings, when applicable) are
     not considered as investing (or financing) activities as they are part of the general objectives and thus
     daily operations of the EU.

     Investing activities are the acquisition and disposal of intangible assets and property, plant and
     equipment and of other investments which are not included in cash equivalents. Investing activities do
     not include loans granted to beneficiaries. The objective is to show the real investments made by the EU.

2.2.      PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT

The Space assets category covers operational fixed assets related to the two EU space programmes: the
Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), i.e. Galileo and EGNOS, and the Copernicus European Earth
observation programme, while assets of the space systems which are not yet operational are included
under the Assets under construction heading.

For Galileo, four new satellites have been added in 2017 to the operational constellation bringing it up to
18 satellites. The Galileo operational fixed assets amounted to EUR 2 276 million at 31 December 2017,
net of depreciation (2016: EUR 2 146 million). The remaining assets under construction totalling
EUR 1 026 million (2016: EUR 756 million) include the four satellites launched in December 2017 for
which the in-orbit testing had not yet been completed at the balance sheet date. The development of the
Galileo system will continue until the system reaches its full operational capacity. When completed, the
Galileo constellation will comprise 24 operational satellites and 6 spares.

Regarding Copernicus, a new satellite (Sentinel 2B) became operational in 2017, in addition to other four
Copernicus operational satellites, increasing the total value of Copernicus operational fixed assets to
EUR 1 140 million (2016: EUR 1 073 million), net of accumulated depreciation. Another EUR 1 443 million
related to Copernicus satellites is recognised as assets under construction (2016: EUR 1 133 million).

Fixed assets related to the European Geostationary Navigation Overlay System (EGNOS) ground
infrastructure of EUR 67 million (2016: EUR 83 million) are also included under the Space assets heading.
In addition, EGNOS assets under construction amount to EUR 52 million (2016: EUR 21 million).

The assets related to the EU space programmes are being built with the assistance of the European
Space Agency (ESA).

2.3.      INVESTMENTS ACCOUNTED FOR USING THE EQUITY
          METHOD

The participation of the EU, represented by the Commission, in the European Investment Fund (EIF) is
treated as an associate using the equity method of accounting. The EIF is the EU's financial institution
specialising in providing risk capital and guarantees to Small and Medium-sized Entities (SMEs). The EIF
is located in Luxembourg and operates as a private-public partnership, whose members are the European
Investment Bank (EIB), the EU and a group of financial institutions. At 31 December 2017 the EU held
29.7 % of ownership interests in the EIF (2016: 28.1 %) and 29.7 % of the voting rights (2016:
28.1 %). In accordance with its statutes, the EIF is required to allocate to a statutory reserve at least
20 % of its annual net result until the aggregate reserve amounts to 10 % of subscribed capital. This
reserve is not available for distribution.

                                                                                            EUR millions

     Out of the total of EUR 13 632 million, the EU holds available for sale financial assets in the form of debt

     the EIB Unitary Fund (money market fund) of EUR 251 million. The debt securities and units in the EIB
     Unitary Fund are mainly used to temporarily invest the amounts allocated to the EU guarantee and risk-
     sharing instruments until they are used to satisfy the guarantee calls.

     BUFI investments
     Provisionally cashed fines related to competition cases are allocated to a dedicated fund (BUFI Fund -
     'Budget Fines' Fund) and invested by the Commission in debt instruments categorised as available for
     sale financial assets.

     ECSC in Liquidation

     Regarding the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) in liquidation, all available for sale financial
     assets are debt securities denominated in EUR and quoted in an active market.

European Bank for Reconstruction and Development

The EU holds a financial investment in the capital of the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development (EBRD), in which at 31 December 2017 the number of shares held were 90 044
(2016: 90 044 shares), representing 3 % of the total subscribed share capital. The EU subscribed for a
total amount of EUR 900 million of share capital, out of which EUR 713 million is currently uncalled.
According to the Agreement establishing EBRD, the shareholders have some contractual restrictions such
as the fact that the shares are not transferable and their redemption is capped at the maximum of the
original purchase cost.

The EU measures the investment in EBRD at fair value. The original purchase cost is considered to be the
best estimate of the fair value, in particular due to contractual restrictions referred to above. Although
EBRD's shares are not quoted in any stock exchange market, there are recent transactions in the
investee's equity (issuance of capital at par value), indicating that the cost is the best estimate of the fair
value in this situation.

GUARANTEE FUNDS FOR BUDGETARY GUARANTEES

EFSI Guarantee Fund
Pursuant to the EFSI Regulation, the EFSI Guarantee Fund has been established to provide a liquidity
cushion against potential losses incurred by the EIB in relation to its financing and investment operations
eligible for the EFSI EU guarantee under the EFSI Agreement - see note 4.1.1. The EFSI Guarantee Fund
is financed by contributions from the EU budget. It is also endowed by returns on guarantee fund
resources invested, revenues received by the EU as remuneration for the guarantee under the EFSI
Agreement, and amounts recovered by the EIB from defaulting debtors in respect of previous guarantee
calls. The fund is managed by the Commission, which is authorised to invest the assets of the EFSI
Guarantee Fund on the financial markets in accordance with the principle of sound financial management
following appropriate prudential rules. The EFSI Guarantee Fund started its operations in April 2016. In
accordance with the EFSI Regulation, as amended in December 2017 (Regulation (EU 2017/2396), it will
be progressively provisioned and shall gradually reach EUR 9.1 billion, i.e. 35 % of the total EU EFSI
guarantee obligations.

Guarantee Fund for external actions
The Guarantee Fund for external actions covers loans guaranteed by the EU budget, in particular EIB
lending operations outside the EU financed from the EIB's own resources and loans under macro-financial
assistance (MFA) and Euratom loans outside the EU – see note 4.1.1. It is a long-term instrument (non-
current part: EUR 2 078 million) managed by the EIB and intended to cover any defaulting loans
guaranteed by the EU. The Fund is endowed by payments from the EU budget, the proceeds from interest
on investments made from the Fund's assets, and sums recovered from defaulting debtors for whom the
Fund has had to activate its guarantee. The Fund should be maintained at a target amount corresponding
to 9 % of the guaranteed loans outstanding at year-end. The difference between the target amount and
the value of the Fund's assets at year-end shall be covered from the EU budget in year n+2, while any
surplus is paid back to the EU budget.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS FINANCED BY THE EU BUDGET

For an overview of all financial instruments financed by the budget see the Financial Statement
Discussion and Analysis.

Horizon 2020
Under the EU Regulation establishing Horizon 2020 – the Framework Programme for Research and
Innovation (2014-2020), new financial instruments have been established in order to enhance access to
finance to entities engaged in research and innovation (R&I). These instruments are: the InnovFin Loan
and Guarantee Service for R&I under which the Commission shares the financial risk related to a portfolio
of new financing operations entered into by the EIB; the InnovFin SME Guarantee including the SME
Initiative Uncapped Guarantee Instrument (SIUGI) – guarantee facilities managed by the EIF providing
guarantees and counter-guarantees to the financial intermediaries for the new portfolios of loans (under
SIUGI the Commission shares the financial risk related to the guarantee given with Member States, EIF
and EIB); and the InnovFin Equity Facility for R&I providing for investments in venture capital funds and
managed by the EIF.

                                        Annual accounts of the European Union 2017

     Risk-Sharing Finance Facility
     The Risk-Sharing Finance Facility (RSFF) is managed by the EIB and the Commission's investment
     portfolio is used to provision financial risk for loans and guarantees given by the EIB to eligible research
     projects. In total, an EU budget of up to EUR 1 billion was allocated to the RSFF under the 2007-2013
     MFF. Under the 2014-2020 MFF, there are no new budget contributions foreseen for the RSFF. The EU
     overall risk is limited to the amount it contributes to the Facility.

     ETF Start up
     These are equity instruments that were financed by the Growth & Employment programme, the MAP
     programme, the CIP programme and the Technology Transfer Pilot Project, under the trusteeship of the
     EIF, supporting the creation and financing of Start-Up SMEs by investing in suitable specialised venture
     capital funds.


     Connecting Europe Facility
     Pursuant to Regulation (EU) No 1316/2013, the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) debt instrument has
     been established with the objective to facilitate infrastructure projects’ access to financing in the sectors
     of transport, telecommunications and energy. It is managed by the EIB under an agreement with the EU.
     The CEF debt financial instrument is the continuity of the Loan Guarantee Instrument for TEN-T projects
     (LGTT) and of the pilot phase of the Project Bond Initiative (PBI). The LGTT and the PBI Portfolio were
     merged into the CEF financial instrument with effect from 1 January 2016. It offers risk-sharing for debt
     financing in the form of senior and subordinated debt or guarantee as well as support for project bonds.

     The EU enters into foreign currency forward contracts in order to hedge the foreign currency risk related
     to USD denominated debt securities held in the EFSI Guarantee Fund. Under the foreign currency forward
     contracts, the EU shall deliver the contractually agreed notional amount in foreign currency ('pay leg'), as
     presented in the table above, and will receive the notional amount in EUR ('receive leg') at the maturity
     date. Such derivative contracts are measured at fair value at the balance sheet date and classified as
     either financial assets or financial liabilities at fair value through surplus or deficit depending on whether
     their fair value is positive or negative. At 31 December 2017, there was only one foreign currency
     forward contract active, resulting in positive fair value of EUR 6 million (fair value hierarchy level 2), thus
     recognised under financial assets at fair value through surplus or deficit.

     The EFSI EU guarantee given to the EIB Group in relation to the portfolios of equity investments is
     classified as a derivative financial instrument and accounted for as a financial asset or financial liability at
     fair value through surplus or deficit (FV hierarchy level 3), see note 4.1.1. At 31 December 2017 the
     amount of the underlying equity investments disbursed by the EIB and EIF amounted to EUR 258 million
     and the fair value of the EFSI EU guarantee on the EFSI equity portfolios totalled EUR 16 million.

Nominal value of loans for financial assistance at 31 December 2017, including ECSC in Liquidation loans,
total EUR 54 093 million (2016: EUR 54 373 million). The change in carrying amount corresponds to the
change in accrued interests.
EFSM enables the granting of financial assistance to a Member State in difficulties or seriously threatened
with severe difficulties caused by exceptional circumstances beyond its control. The assistance may take
the form of a loan or credit line. The ECOFIN Council conclusions of 9 May 2010 restrict the facility to
EUR 60 billion but the legal limit restricts the outstanding amount of loans or credit lines to the margin
available under the own resources ceiling. Borrowings related to loans disbursed under the EFSM are
guaranteed by the EU budget. It is not foreseen that the EFSM will engage in new financing programmes
or enter into new loan facility agreements.
The BOP facility, a policy-based financial instrument, provides medium-term financial assistance to
Member States of the EU that have not adopted the Euro. It enables the granting of loans to Member
States who are experiencing, or are seriously threatened with, difficulties in their balance of payments or
capital movements. The maximum outstanding amount of loans granted under the instrument is limited
to EUR 50 billion. Borrowings related to these BOP loans are guaranteed by the EU budget.
MFA is a policy-based financial instrument of untied and undesignated balance of payment and/or budget
support to partner countries currently following an IMF programme. It takes the form of medium/long
term loans or grants or an appropriate combination of both and generally complements financing
provided in the context of an IMF-supported adjustment and reform program. These loans are
guaranteed by the Guarantee Fund for external actions. In 2017, new loan disbursements under MFA
totalled EUR 1 013 million, of which EUR 600 million has been provided to Ukraine, EUR 300 million to
Tunisia, EUR 100 million to Jordan and EUR 13 million to Georgia. At 31 December 2017, another

     EUR 460 million relating to a loan facility agreement under MFA were granted to Tunisia
     (EUR 300 million), to Jordan (EUR 100 million) and to Moldavia (EUR 60 million) but not yet disbursed –
     see note 4.1.2. The remaining EUR 600 million available under the MFA loan facility agreement to
     Ukraine has not been requested by Ukraine within the availability period which ended in January 2018.
     The European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom, represented by the Commission) lends money to
     both Member States and non-Member States, and to entities of both, to finance projects relating to
     energy installations. At 31 December 2017, loans of EUR 250 million were granted for projects in Ukraine
     but not yet disbursed – see note 4.1.2. Guarantees from third-parties of EUR 250 million (2016:
     EUR 252 million) have been received covering Euratom loans.

     ECSC in Liquidation loans are not loans for financial assistance but promissory notes in order to keep the
     cash flows in parallel with the borrowings. However, similar to the loans for financial assistance, they
     were granted on borrowed funds in accordance with articles 54 and 56 of the ECSC Treaty for project
     financing.

     Subrogated loans are defaulted loans which were granted by the EIB and guaranteed by EU budget, for
     which all rights have been subrogated to the EU following the payment from the Guarantee Fund for
     external actions. These loans are fully impaired for an amount of EUR 432 million (2016:
     EUR 332 million). Guarantee calls, which occurred in 2017, were partially covered by financial provisions
     made in previous years. Under an agreement between the EU and the EIB, recovery proceedings are
     undertaken by the EIB on behalf of the EU with an aim to recover any sums due.

The level of pre-financing amounts in the various programmes must be sufficient to ensure the necessary
funding for the beneficiary to start the project, while also safeguarding the financial interests of the EU
and taking into consideration legal, operational and cost-effectiveness constraints. All these elements
have been given due consideration by the Commission in an effort to improve the follow-up of pre-
financing.

Pre-financing represents money paid out, and thus implementation of payment appropriations. As
explained in note 1.5.7, these are advances and so not yet expensed. Thus while pre-financing reduces
outstanding RAL (see note 5.1) it represents expenses still to be recognised in the statement of financial
performance.


                                                                                                                  49

                                      Annual accounts of the European Union 2017

     The closure of the programming period 2007-2013 and the gradual set-up of programs under the period
     2014-2020 strongly influence the amounts on the balance sheet: pre-financing related to the old
     programs is decreasing due to the acceptance of costs as programmes are closed, while further pre-
     financing has been paid out concerning the new programming period.

     For shared management this transition between programming periods also explains the movement
     between current and non-current balances. Concerning the programming period 2014-2020, the initial
     pre-financing paid is booked as non-current, while the annual pre-financing is booked as current.

     The increase of EUR 0.9 billion in other shared management concerns EUSF (European Union Solidarity
     Fund), mainly to support reconstruction works after the earthquakes in the Italian regions of Abruzzo,
     Lazio, Marche and Umbria.

     For direct management, the pre-financing amounts relate mainly to Horizon 2020 and the Connecting
     Europe Facility.

     The pre-financing under indirect management covers mainly internal policies programmes like Erasmus,
     Galileo and EGNOS, but also instruments related to external relations like ENI (European Neighbourhood
     Instrument), DCI (Development Cooperation Instrument) and humanitarian aid.

     Guarantees received in respect of pre-financing

     These are guarantees that the Commission requests from beneficiaries that are not Member States in
     certain cases when paying out advance payments (pre-financing). There are two values to disclose for
     this type of guarantee, the “nominal” and the “on-going” values. For the nominal value, the generating
     event is linked to the existence of the guarantee. For the on-going value, the guarantee’s generating
     event is the pre-financing payment and/or subsequent clearings. At 31 December 2017 the nominal value
     of guarantees received in respect of pre-financing amounted to EUR 620 million while the on-going value
     of those guarantees was EUR 462 million (2016: EUR 683 million and EUR 496 million respectively).

     Certain pre-financing amounts paid out under the 7th Research Framework Programme for research and
     technological development (FP7) and under Horizon 2020 are effectively covered by a Participants
     Guarantee Fund (PGF). The PGF is a mutual benefit instrument set up to cover the risks relating to non-
     payment of amounts by the beneficiaries during the implementation of the indirect actions of FP7 and
     Horizon 2020. All participants of indirect actions receiving a grant from the EU contribute 5 % of the total
     amount received to the PGF's capital.

     At 31 December 2017 pre-financing amounts covered by the PGF totalled EUR 1.9 billion (2016:
     EUR 1.8 billion). The EU (represented by the Commission) acts as an executive agent of the participants
     of the PGF, but the fund is owned by the participants.

     At year-end, the PGF had total assets of EUR 1 997 million (2016: EUR 1 951 million). The assets of the
     PGF also include financial assets that are managed by the Directorate-General for Economic and Financial
     Affairs of the Commission. As the PGF is a separate entity the assets of the fund are not consolidated in
     these EU annual accounts.

Advances to Member States for financial instruments under shared management

Under the framework of the European Structural and Investment Funds (ESIF) programmes, it is possible
to make advance payments from the EU budget to Member States so as to allow them to contribute to
financial instruments (i.e. loans, equity investments or guarantees). These financial instruments are set
up and managed under the responsibility of the Member States, not the Commission. Nevertheless,
monies that are unused by these instruments at year-end are the property of the EU (as with all pre-
financing) and are thus treated as an asset on the EU’s balance sheet.

2014-2020 Period:

Under cohesion policy the Member States have contributed an amount of EUR 3 714 million, of which it is
estimated that EUR 2 760 million was still to be implemented at 31 December 2017. This includes the
contribution of the Member States to the SME Initiative, an instrument aimed at stimulating additional
lending by the banking sector to SMEs (EUR 966 million paid, out of which EUR 315 million is estimated
as not yet implemented).

For rural development, EUR 8 million remained unused at year-end.

2007-2013 Period:

All amounts related to the cohesion policy are considered to have been either implemented or re-
allocated to other measures, therefore no assets remain on the balance sheet at 31 December 2017. It
should be noted that the actual implementation by the various instruments will be reviewed as part of the
closure process of the programmes.

Aid Schemes

Similar to the above, advances paid by the Member States for various aid schemes (state aid, market
measures of EAGF or investment measures of EAFRD) that were not used at year-end are recorded as
assets on the EU's balance sheet. The Commission has estimated the value of these advances based on
information provided by the Member States; the resulting amounts are included under the Aid Schemes
sub-heading above.

2014-2020 Period:

The unused amounts at year end were estimated at EUR 680 million for cohesion policy and
EUR 904 million for agricultural policy.

2007-2013 Period:

It is estimated that EUR 311 million (2016: EUR 461 million) representing advances paid in the context of
the agricultural policy remained unused at the end of 2017.

Own resources recoverables

Traditional own resources (TOR), composed of customs duties and sugar levies, are collected by Member
States on behalf of the Commission. Member States establish TOR and communicate the amounts of the
entitlements established to the Commission by means of monthly 'A account' statements. Established
entitlements that have not been included in the 'A accounts', because they have not been recovered by
Member States and no security has been provided (or if security has been provided but are anyway
contested), are shown in the 'separate account'. These entitlements are subject to impairment on the
basis of information provided every year by the Member States.

On 31 December 2016 there were ratified own resources adjustments related to the new provisions
introduced by the Own Resources Decision (ORD) 2014 concerning 2014, 2015 and 2016 and they were
receivable on 1 January 2017. The remaining amounts relate to the amending budget no 6/2017 adopted
on 30 November 2017. The amounts were to be received on the first working day of January 2018.

On 8 March 2018, the European Commission sent a letter of formal notice (Infringement No 2018/2008)
to the United Kingdom because it refuses to make customs duties available to the EU budget, as required
by EU law. A 2017 OLAF report found that importers in the United Kingdom evaded a large amount of
customs duties by using fictitious and false invoices and incorrect customs value declarations at
importation. The Commission calculates that the infringement of EU legislation by the United Kingdom
resulted, during the period November 2011 until December 2017, in losses to the EU budget amounting
to EUR 2.2 billion (net, i.e. after deducting the collection costs to be retained by the UK from the gross
amount of EUR 2.7 billion). Late interest will also be due on this amount. The amounts in question are
not included in these 2017 accounts as they will only be recognised once the revenue recognition criteria
are met, in accordance with the EU accounting rules.

EAGF and Rural Development recoverables

This item primarily covers the amounts owed by Member States at 31 December 2017, as declared and
certified by the Member States at 15 October 2017. An estimation is made for the recoverables arising
after this declaration and up to 31 December 2017. The Commission also estimates a write-down for the
amounts owed by beneficiaries that are unlikely to be recovered. The fact that such an adjustment is
made does not mean that the Commission is waiving future recovery of these amounts. A deduction of
20 % is also included in the adjustment, and corresponds to what Member States are allowed to retain to
cover administrative costs.


2.6.1.2.   Recoverables from competition fines
                                                                                             EUR millions

The recoverables of EUR 4 225 million refer to competition fines which were not cashed at year end
(EUR 4 397 million) less amounts written-down (EUR 172 million). The amounts cashed mainly relate to
cash receipts from companies that have nevertheless initiated an appeal or still have the option to appeal
against the fine decisions at EU courts. A contingent liability is disclosed for the possibility to pay back
these amounts to the companies (see note 4.1.4).

Fined companies who have launched or are planning to launch an appeal have an option to either make
provisional payments or to provide bank guarantees to the Commission.

It should be noted that EUR 942 million of the fines not cashed at year end were due for payment after
31 December 2017. For some of the fines not cashed at year end, the Commission has accepted
guarantees totalling EUR 3 124 million (2016: EUR 1 012 million). After 31 December 2017, the
Commission has accepted additional guarantees of EUR 880 million.

The amounts written down reflect the Commission's case by case assessment on fines amounts not
cashed or not covered with a guarantee, which the Commission expects to not recover.

                                     Annual accounts of the European Union 2017

     The increase in the competition fines recoverables mainly concerns one significant fine
     (EUR 2 424 million) where the companies concerned covered the fine with Commission accepted bank
     guarantees i.e. the fine would not be cashed until the final court settlement.


     2.6.1.3.   Accrued income and deferred charges

     The other accrued income includes EUR 271 million that the Commission expects to recover from the
     Member States in the area of cohesion. The recovery will be made as a result of the examination and
     acceptance of the annual accounts submitted by the Member States on 15 February 2018. This procedure
     for the acceptance of Member States' annual accounts has been introduced for the first time in the
     cohesion area for the programming period 2014-2020.

2.8.1.     Bank accounts for budget implementation and other term deposits

This heading covers the funds which the Commission keeps in its bank accounts in each Member State
and EFTA country (treasury or central bank), as well as in commercial bank current accounts, imprest
accounts and petty cash. The treasury balance at the end of 2017 is due to the following main elements:

    •    As regards own resources, the end of year treasury balance includes a total net amount of
         EUR 8.9 billion to be returned to Member States in early 2018 as a result of an amending budget
         adopted late in 2017.

    •    The additional amount of fines imposed by the Commission for breach of competition rules of
         EUR 0.5 billion definitively cashed late in 2017 is also part of the year-end treasury balance.

    •    The treasury balance also includes assigned revenue payment appropriations of EUR 8.4 billion.


2.8.2.     Cash belonging to financial instruments

Amounts shown under this heading primarily concern cash equivalents managed by fiduciaries on behalf
of the Commission for the purpose of implementing particular financial instrument programmes funded
by the EU budget (see note 2.4.1). The cash belonging to financial instruments can only be used in the
programme concerned.


2.8.3.     Cash relating to fines

This is cash received in connection with fines issued by the Commission for which the case is still open.
These amounts are kept in specific deposit accounts that are not used for any other activities. Where an
appeal has been lodged or when it is unknown if an appeal will be made by the other party, the
underlying amount is shown as contingent liability in note 4.1.4.

Since 2010, all new provisionally cashed fines are managed by the Commission in the BUFI fund and
invested in financial instruments categorised as available for sale (see note 2.4.1).




                                                                                                            55

     The increase in the total employee benefits liability is primarily due to an increase in the net liability of
     the Pension Scheme of European Officials. This increase is mainly due to: the fact that additional benefit
     rights gained by scheme members exceeded benefit payments out of the scheme, updated actuarial
     assumptions, and a data quality review, partially offset by the increase in the discount rate.


     2.9.1.    Pension Scheme of European Officials

     This defined benefit obligation represents the present value of expected future payments that the EU is
     required to make so as to settle the pension obligations resulting from employee service in the current
     and prior periods. The scheme is ongoing, and as such, all payments required to be made from the
     scheme on an annual basis are included in the EU budget each year.

     In accordance with Article 83 of the Staff Regulations, the payment of the benefits provided for in the
     staff pension scheme constitutes a charge to the EU's budget. The scheme is unfunded, but the Member
     States guarantee the payment of these benefits collectively. A compulsory pension contribution is
     deducted from the basic salaries of active members, currently 9.8 %. These contributions are treated as
     budget revenue of the year and contribute to the funding of EU expenditure in general, see also note 3.6.

     The liabilities of the pension scheme were assessed on the basis of the number of staff and retired staff
     at 31 December 2017 and on the rules of the Staff Regulations applicable at this date. This valuation was
     carried out in accordance with the methodology of IPSAS 25 (and therefore also EU accounting rule 12).
     As was already noted in the 2016 annual accounts, the relevant Commission services continued to work
     during 2017 to strengthen data collection methods and thus the underlying data quality. Improvements
     have been achieved and are reflected in the total employee benefits liability amount. This work is
     ongoing.

     In 2018 the updated EU accounting rule 12 based on IPSAS 39 will be applicable. The impact of any
     changes will be thus reflected in the 2018 accounts.


     2.9.2.    Other retirement benefit schemes

     This refers to the liability relating to the pension obligations towards Members and former Members of the
     Commission, the Court of Justice (and General Court) and the Court of Auditors, the Secretaries General
     of the Council, the Ombudsman, the European Data Protection Supervisor, and the European Union Civil
     Service Tribunal. Also included under this heading is a liability relating to the pensions of Members of the
     European Parliament.


     2.9.3.    Joint Sickness Insurance Scheme

     In addition to the above retirement benefit schemes, a valuation is made for the estimated liability that
     the EU has regarding the Joint Sickness Insurance Scheme in relation to healthcare costs which must be
     paid during employees' post-activity periods (net of their contributions). The calculation of this liability,
     based on EU accounting rule (EAR) 12, takes account of the full active service period. The update of
     EAR 12 effective from 2018 onwards will reflect IPSAS 39 and may revise this method.

Current service costs are the increase in the present value of the defined benefit obligation arising from
current members' service in the current period. Interest costs are the increase during the period in the
present value of the defined benefit obligation because the benefits are one period closer to settlement.

Net Actuarial gains and losses comprise:
    •   Experience adjustments (the effects of differences between the previous actuarial assumptions
        for 2017 and what has actually occurred in 2017); and
    •   Effects of changes in actuarial assumptions, either financial (such as projected salary increases)
        or demographic (such as mortality rates). These assumptions are updated regularly to reflect
        changes in the underlying conditions.

Benefits (for example, pensions or medical cost re-imbursements) are paid during the year according to
the rules of the scheme. These benefits paid lead to a decrease in the defined benefit obligation as they
are no longer to be paid in the future.

the EU are shown below:

     Mortality rates are based on the EU Civil Servants Life Table - EULT 2018 (2016: International Civil
     Servants Life Table – ICSLT 2013).

     The nominal discount rate is determined as the value of the Euro zero-coupon yield (with a maturity of
     20 years as of December 2017 for the Pension Scheme of European Officials (PSEO), and 25 years for the
     Joint Sickness Insurance Scheme). The inflation rate used is the expected inflation rate over the
     equivalent period. It must be determined empirically, based on prospective values as expressed by index-
     linked bonds on the European financial markets. The real discount rate is calculated from the nominal
     discount rate and the expected long-term inflation rate.

     The significant increase in the employee benefits liability over the five years can largely be explained by a
     reduction in the real discount rate used to discount the future cash flows. This reduction is linked to the
     underlying economic conditions, particularly the fall in interest rates. For the main PSEO scheme, for
     example, the real discount rate fell from 1.8 % at the end of 2013 to 0.4 % at the end of 2017.

 Provisions are amounts, arising from past events, that will probably have to be paid by the EU budget in
 the future.

 Legal cases

 This is the estimate of amounts that will probably have to be paid out after the year-end in relation to a
 number of on-going legal cases.

 Nuclear site dismantlement

 In 2017 the basis for the provision was updated as per the "JRC Decommissioning & Waste Management
 Programme Strategy (D&WMP) – Updated in 2017". The review of the strategy, along with budget and
 staff needs, has been conducted together with the independent D&WMP Expert Group. It is a follow up of
 the comments raised by the Review of the JRC D&WM Programme made by external experts in 2012 and
 the recommendations raised by the 2015 JRC Internal Audit on Decommissioning. It represents the best
 available estimate of the budget and staff needed to complete the decommissioning of the JRC sites of
 Ispra, Geel, Karlsruhe and Petten.

 In accordance with the EU accounting rules, this provision is indexed for inflation and then discounted to
 its net present value (using the Euro swap curve). At 31 December 2017, this resulted in a provision of
 EUR 1 934 million, split between amounts expected to be used in 2018 (EUR 30 million) and afterwards
 (EUR 1 904 million). The increase of EUR 821 million compared to 31 December 2016 is mainly due to
 the extended timeframe (currently around 40 years, previously around 20 years).

 It must be noted that major uncertainties, inherent to the long term planning of nuclear
 decommissioning, could affect this estimate which could significantly increase in the future. The main
 sources of uncertainty are related to the end state of the decommissioned site, nuclear materials, waste
 management and disposal aspects, incomplete or lacking definition of national regulatory frames,
 complicated and time consuming licensing process and future developments of the decommissioning
 industrial market.

 Financial provisions

 These concern mainly provisions which represent the estimated losses that will be incurred in relation to
 the guarantees given under different financial instruments, where entrusted entities are empowered to
 issue guarantees in their own name but on behalf of and at the risk of the EU. The financial risk of the EU
 linked to the guarantees is capped and financial assets are gradually provisioned to cover for the future
 guarantee calls. This heading also includes provisions for outstanding loans to Syria issued by the EIB
 under its external lending mandate and thus guaranteed by the EU via the Guarantee Fund for external
 actions. Non-current financial provisions are discounted to their net present value.

 The increase of the financial provision relates to the increase of the volume of guaranteed operations
 under H2020 and COSME financial instruments.

     Borrowings mainly include debts evidenced by certificates amounting to EUR 54 674 million (2016:
     EUR 54 951 million). The changes in carrying amount correspond to the change in accrued interests.

     Aside from ECSC in liquidation, the repayment of the above borrowings are ultimately guaranteed by the
     EU budget – see note 4.1.2, and by extension each Member State.

As at 31 December 2017 the EU holds a derivative financial instrument (Foreign exchange option – put
spread type of option) in which it covers the devaluation of the foreign exchange currency (UHA) related
to loans given by financial institutions to the SMEs in Ukraine so as to enhance the access to financing, as
well as the attractiveness of the loan conditions in Ukraine. Under the terms of the contract, the EU
provides its partners with an option to call, for each eligible loan, up to a maximum of 30 %, for an EU
contribution in the case of devaluation the ratio UHA/EUR.
At 31 December 2017 all financial liabilities at fair value through surplus or deficit are categorised into
level 2 of the fair value hierarchy (valuation based on observable inputs other than quoted prices).


2.11.3. Financial guarantee liabilities

The EFSI guarantee on the debt portfolio disbursed by the EIB under the EFSI Innovation and
Infrastructure window (IIW) is classified as a financial guarantee liability. At 31 December 2017 the EFSI
financial guarantee liability totals EUR zero, as the revenues to be received under the guarantee exceed
expected losses (see note 4.1.1).

     Payables include invoices and cost claims received but not yet paid at year end. They are initially
     recognised at the time of the reception of the invoices / cost claims for the requested amounts. The
     payables are subsequently adjusted to reflect only the amounts accepted following review of costs, and
     the amounts estimated to be eligible, following the cut-off procedure. The amounts estimated to be non-
     eligible are included in the column "Adjustments"; the largest amounts concern the structural actions.

     In the 2014-2020 programming period, the Common Provisions Regulation (CPR) applicable to the
     Structural Funds (ERDF and ESF), Cohesion Fund and to the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund
     (EMFF) foresees that the EU budget is protected by means of a systematic retention of 10 % of the
     interim payments made. By February following the end of the CPR accounting year (1 July - 30 June), the
     control cycle is complete both through management verifications by the managing authorities and audits
     by the audit authorities. The Commission examines the assurance documents and the accounts provided
     by the relevant authorities in the Member States. The payment / recovery of the final balance is made
     only after this assessment is finalised and the accounts are accepted. The amount retained according to
     this provision at end 2017 totalled EUR 3.1 billion. A part of this amount (EUR 0.6 billion) is estimated as
     being non-eligible on the basis of the information provided by the Member States in their accounts and is
     also included in the column "Adjustments". The final component of the adjustments to the payables is
     represented by the amounts corresponding to other advances to Member States (see note 2.5.2) still to
     pay at year end (EUR 0.3 billion).

     Concerning cohesion policy (ERDF, CF, ESF) the claims related to the period 2007-2013 remain significant
     at EUR 10 billion, as the Commission is checking the final cost claims submitted by the Member States. At
     the same time, claims related to period 2014-2020 increased to EUR 5 billion following progress in the
     implementation of the programmes.

     Requests for pre-financing
     In addition to the above amounts, EUR 0.5 billion of requests for pre-financing have been received and
     were not yet paid at year-end. According to the EU accounting rules, these amounts are not booked as
     payables.

     Own Resources Payables
     Own resources payables refer to Member States contributions to the EU budget to be reimbursed at year-
     end following the amending budget no 6/2017. Amending budgets are implemented according to
     Article 10(3) of Regulation no 609/2014. The significant amount on 31 December 2017 is due to the
     adoption of amending budget no 6/2017 on 30 November 2017. According to this legal provision, the
     resulting amounts were returned to the Member States on the first working day of January 2018.

The biggest movement concerns cohesion policy, a decrease of EUR 2.9 billion for ERDF & CF and
EUR 0.6 billion for ESF. This is due to the decreasing accruals for the former programming period 2007-
2013 as the programmes have entered the closure phase.

2.14.2. Guarantee Fund reserve

This reserve reflects the 9 % target amount of the outstanding amounts guaranteed by the EU budget
under the EIB external lending mandate, that is required to be kept as assets in the Guarantee Fund for
external actions (see note 2.4.1).




                                                                                                           63

     2.14.3. Other reserves

     The amount relates primarily to the reserves of the ECSC in liquidation (EUR 1 515 million) for the assets
     of the Research Fund for Coal and Steel, which were created in the context of the winding-up of the
     ECSC.



     2.15. AMOUNTS TO BE CALLED FROM MEMBER STATES

                                                                                                 EUR millions

     Amounts to be called from Member States at 31.12.2016                                          76 881

     Other reserve movements                                                                             11

     Total amounts to be called from Member States at 31.12.2017                                    75 234

     This amount represents that part of the expenses incurred by the EU up to 31 December that must be
     funded by future budgets. Many expenses are recognised under accrual accounting rules in the year N
     although they may be actually paid in year N+1 (or later) and therefore funded using the budget of year
     N+1 (or later). The inclusion in the accounts of these liabilities coupled with the fact that the
     corresponding amounts are financed from future budgets, results in liabilities greatly exceeding assets at
     the year-end. The most significant amounts to be highlighted concern the EAGF activities and employee
     benefit liabilities.

     It should also be noted that the above has no effect on the budget result – budget revenue should always
     equal or exceed budget expenditure and any excess of revenue is returned to Member States.

3.        NOTES TO THE STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL
          PERFORMANCE
REVENUE

REVENUE FROM NON-EXCHANGE TRANSACTIONS:
OWN RESOURCES


3.1.      GNI RESOURCES

Own resources revenue is the primary element of the EU's operating revenue. GNI (gross national
income) revenue amounts to EUR 78 620 million for 2017 (2016: EUR 95 578 million) and is the most
significant of the three categories of own resources. A uniform percentage is levied on the GNI of each
Member State. The GNI revenue balances revenue and expenditure i.e. funds the part of the budget that
is not covered by other sources of income. The decrease of GNI revenue is explained mainly by the
substantial reduction of payment appropriations and the relatively high budget surplus from the previous
financial year (EUR 6 405 million). Both elements reduced the requested Member States' GNI contribution
in 2017, as this contribution is a balancing figure.



3.2.      TRADITIONAL OWN RESOURCES

                                                                                             EUR millions
                                                                               2017               2016
Customs duties                                                                 20 475            20 301
Sugar levies                                                                       45               138
Total                                                                         20 520            20 439

Traditional own resources comprise custom duties and sugar levies. Member States retain, by way of
collection costs, 20 % of traditional own resources, and the above amounts are shown net of this
deduction.



3.3.      VAT RESOURCES

The VAT resource is levied on Member States’ VAT bases, which are notionally harmonised in accordance
with EU rules for this purpose. The VAT contribution is calculated applying a uniform rate of call of 0.3 %
to the base of each Member State. For the period 2014-2020, the Council Decision 2014/335/EU,
Euratom, foresees a reduced rate of call of 0.15 % for Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden.



REVENUE FROM NON-EXCHANGE TRANSACTIONS:
TRANSFERS


3.4.      FINES

These revenues of EUR 4 664 million (2016: EUR 3 858 million) relate to fines the Commission has
imposed on companies for breaches of EU competition rules and to fines the Commission has imposed on
Member States for infringements of EU law. The Commission recognises revenues from fines when it
adopts the decision to impose a fine and it officially notifies the addressee. The fine amounts in 2017 are
mainly competition fines (EUR 4 568 million). The biggest cases concern breaches of EU antitrust rules,
i.e. a fine imposed on Alphabet Inc. and Google Inc. for abusing market dominance as a search engine

                                                                                                              65

                                      Annual accounts of the European Union 2017

     and fines on 11 air cargo carriers for a price fixing cartel (EUR 776 million).



     3.5.     RECOVERY OF EXPENSES

     Direct management                                                                81                 56
     Indirect management                                                              23                 15

     This heading mainly represents the recovery orders issued by the Commission that are cashed or offset
     against (i.e. deducted from) subsequent payments recorded in the Commission's accounting system,
     made so as to recover expenditure previously paid out from the general budget. Recoveries are based on
     controls, audits or eligibility analysis and therefore, these actions are an important consideration in
     implementing the EU budget. These operations protect the EU budget from expenditure incurred in
     breach of law and are particularly important since the audit results of the European Court of Auditors
     have found a material level of error in payments made from the EU budget – see the Court's annual
     report including the statement of assurance on the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions.

     Recovery orders issued by Member States to beneficiaries of EAGF expenditure, as well as the variation of
     accrued income estimations from the previous year-end to the current, are also included.

     The amounts included in the above table represent revenue incurred through the issuance of recovery
     orders. For this reason, these figures cannot and do not show the full extent of the measures taken to
     protect the EU budget, particularly for cohesion policy where specific mechanisms are in place to ensure
     the correction of ineligible expenditure, most of which do not involve the issuance of a recovery order.
     Not included are amounts recovered through offsetting with expenses, amounts recovered by way of
     withdrawals and recoveries of pre-financing amounts.

     Shared management recoveries make up the bulk of the total:

     Agriculture: EAGF and rural development

     In the framework of the EAGF and the EAFRD, amounts accounted for as revenue of the year under this
     heading are financial corrections of the year and reimbursements declared by Member States and
     recovered during the year, as well as the net increase in the outstanding amounts declared by Member
     States to be recovered at year-end concerning fraud and irregularities.

     Cohesion policy

     The main amounts related to cohesion policy include recovery orders issued by the Commission to
     recover undue expenditure made in previous years and deductions from expenditure less the decrease in
     accrued income at year-end.

The budgetary adjustments include the budget surplus from 2016 (EUR 6 405 million). The budget
surplus of the previous year is brought forward to the next year and constitutes a revenue for 2017.

Contributions from third countries are contributions from EFTA countries and accession countries.

Staff taxes and contributions revenue arises primarily from deductions from staff salaries and is made up
of two significant amounts – staff pension contributions and taxes on income.

Contributions from Member States for external aid are mainly the amounts received to set up the Facility
for Refugees in Turkey.

Transfer of assets revenue relates mainly to the transfer of satellites under the Copernicus programme
(former GMES programme) from the European Space Agency (ESA) to the Commission (see note 2.2).
This transfer is a non-exchange transaction according to the EU accounting rules and will occur in future
periods for the remaining Copernicus satellites currently under construction.

Agricultural levies concern milk levies which are a market management tool aimed at penalising milk
producers who exceed their reference quantities. As it is not linked to prior payments by the Commission,
it is in practice considered as revenue for a specific purpose.

The 2017 amount of other revenue from non-exchange transactions includes an amount of
EUR 300 million called from the EDF, representing its contribution to the EFSD guarantee fund which will
be established in 2018 under the Regulation (EU) 2017/1601.

The transition from the former programming period 2007-2013 to the current programming period 2014-
2020 explains the reduction of expenses of EUR 17.4 billion for the cohesion area: the costs declared for
the period 2007-2013 decreased substantially (EUR 28.6 billion) as the implementation has finished and
the programmes have entered the closure phase. At the same time the costs declared for the period
2014-2020 increased but only by EUR 11.2 billion as the programmes are now advancing.

Other expenses mainly includes: Asylum and Migration (EUR 485 million), Fund for European Aid to the
Most Deprived (EUR 378 million) and Internal Security (EUR 226 million).

The increase in expenses related to provisions is due mainly to the change in estimation for the nuclear
site dismantlement provision (see note 2.10).

Expenses relating to research and development are included in administrative and IT expenses and are
as follows:

4.        CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND ASSETS

4.1.      CONTINGENT LIABILITIES

Contingent liabilities are possible future payment obligations for the EU that may arise due to past events
or legally binding commitments taken but which will depend on future events not wholly under the
control of the EU. They relate mainly to financial guarantees given (on loans and financial assistance
programmes) and to legal risks. All contingent liabilities, except those relating to fines and guarantees
covered by funds (see note 2.4.1), would be financed, should they fall due, by the EU budget (and thus
the EU Member States) in the years to come.

The above table shows the extent of the exposure of the EU budget to possible future payments linked to
guarantees given to the EIB group. Disbursed amounts represent the amounts already given to final
beneficiaries, while signed amounts include these disbursed monies plus agreements already signed with
beneficiaries but not yet disbursed. The ceiling represents the total guarantee that the EU budget, and
thus its Member States, have committed to cover.

EIB external lending mandate guarantees

The EU budget guarantees loans signed and granted by the EIB from the EIB's own resources to third
countries. At 31 December 2017 the amount of loans outstanding and covered by the EU guarantee
totalled EUR 19 972 million (2016: 21 145 million). The EU budget guarantees:

     •   EUR 18 583 million (2016: EUR 19 481 million) via the Guarantee Fund for external actions (see
         note 2.4.1), and

     •   EUR 1 389 million (2016: EUR 1 664 million) directly for loans granted to Member States before
         accession.

In addition to the EUR 19 972 million disclosed above as disbursed, the EU guarantees a further
EUR 258 million of outstanding loans to Syria for which provisions have been made.

The EU external lending mandate guarantee relating to loans granted by the EIB is limited to 65 % of the
outstanding balances for agreements signed after 2007 (mandates 2007-2013 and 2014-2020). For
agreements before 2007 the EU guarantee is limited to a percentage of the ceiling of the credit lines
authorised, in most cases 65 % but also 70 %, 75 % or 100 %. Where the ceiling is not reached, the EU
guarantee covers the full amount.

To disclose the maximum exposure faced by the EU at 31 December 2017, however, one must also
include loans authorised to be signed but not yet signed (EUR 8 529 million) and loans signed but not
disbursed (EUR 8 978 million).

In March 2018 Decision (EU) 2018/412 was adopted by the European Parliament and the Council allowing
for an increase of the ceiling of the EIB financing operations under the EU guarantee. This will be
reflected in an updated guarantee agreement with the EIB and when amended, the EU maximum
exposure would increase by EUR 3.4 billion.

     European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI) guarantee

     EFSI is an initiative that aims to increase the risk bearing capacity of the EIB Group by enabling the EIB
     to extend its investments in the EU. The objective of EFSI is to support additional investments in the EU
     and access to finance for small companies. EFSI is not a separate legal entity or an investment fund in
     the strict sense. The EFSI risk reserve offers protection to the EIB against potential losses for underlying
     operations. It is composed of an allocation of EUR 5 billion of EIB's own capital and an EU budget
     guarantee of up to EUR 16 billion ('EFSI EU guarantee'). The EFSI EU guarantee is provided to the EIB
     under an agreement between the EU and the EIB, hereafter referred to as 'EFSI Agreement'.

     The amounts related to the EFSI contingent liabilities, including the guarantee ceiling, as disclosed in this
     note are based on the EFSI Agreement in force at 31 December 2017. However, it should be noted that
     the amended EFSI Regulation (Regulation EU 2017/2396), as adopted in December 2017, enabled an
     increase of the EFSI EU Guarantee up to EUR 26 billion. The EFSI Agreement has been amended
     accordingly in March 2018.

     The EFSI operations are conducted within two windows: the Infrastructure and Innovation Window (IIW)
     implemented by the EIB (EFSI EU guarantee of EUR 13 billion) and the SME Window (SMEW)
     implemented by the EIF (EFSI EU guarantee of EUR 3 billion), both of which have a debt portfolio and
     an equity portfolio. The EIF acts under an agreement with the EIB on the basis of an EIB guarantee which
     itself is counter-guaranteed by the EFSI EU Guarantee under the EFSI Agreement.

     For the purpose of the use of the EFSI EU guarantee the implementation of EFSI is supervised by
     a steering board acting by consensus and composed of four members, of which three are appointed by
     the Commission and one by the EIB. Under the amended EFSI Regulation, the EFSI steering board will be
     composed of five members, including one non-voting member appointed by the European Parliament,
     while the decisions shall be taken by consensus, and - if the consensus cannot be achieved - by the
     unanimous vote among its voting members. The EFSI steering board does not take investment decisions.

     The EU and the EIB have distinct roles within EFSI. EFSI is established within the EIB who finances the
     operations (debt and equity investments) and, to do this, borrows the necessary funds on the capital
     markets. Regarding the IIW, the EIB takes the investment decisions independently and manages the
     operations in accordance with its rules and procedures. The same applies to the SMEW operations
     managed by the EIF.

     In order to ensure that investments made under EFSI remain focused on the specific objective of
     addressing the market failures which hinder investment in the EU and that they are eligible for the
     protection of the EU guarantee, a dedicated governance structure has been put in place. The Investment
     Committee of independent experts examines each project proposed by the EIB under the IIW regarding
     its eligibility for the EU guarantee coverage. Once an operation is confirmed to be eligible as EFSI
     guaranteed operation, the decision to continue with the project and its management is then subject to
     the normal EIB project cycle and governance process. Regarding SMEW, the role of the Investment
     Committee is limited to the consultation on the description of the SMEW Products, which are being
     approved by the EFSI Steering Board and EFSI Managing Director.

     The role of the EU relates to the provision of the EU budget guarantee for part of the potential losses that
     the EIB may suffer from its investments in debt and equity instruments. Consequently, the EU does not
     intervene in the selection and management of EFSI operations, does not invest money in the EFSI
     operations and is not a direct contractual party to the underlying instruments. As the control criteria and
     accounting requirements for consolidation under the EU accounting rules (and IPSAS) are not met, the
     related guaranteed assets are not accounted for in the consolidated annual accounts of the EU.

     The EU guarantee granted to the EIB Group under EFSI is, in accordance with the EU accounting rules,
     accounted for as a financial guarantee liability in respect of the IIW debt portfolio, as a financial provision
     for the SMEW debt portfolio and as a derivative (financial asset or liability at fair value through surplus or
     deficit) for both equity portfolios. In addition, a contingent liability related to the EFSI guarantee given is
     disclosed in this note.

     Under the EFSI IIW debt portfolio, the EU guarantee covers the first loss piece of a portfolio of financing
     operations entered into by the EIB, which are mainly standard loans and guarantees. The EU guarantee is
     called when the debtor fails to make a payment when due or in the case of a debt restructuring. The EU
     guarantee is remunerated in proportion to the risk taken by the EU and this happens in the form of a
     distribution, between the EIB and the EU, of the risk-related revenues received by EIB from the
     guaranteed operations. The EU revenues should first cover the losses incurred on the guaranteed
     operations. The EU guarantee is therefore accounted for as financial guarantee liability and measured, at


74

                                  Annual accounts of the European Union 2017

initial recognition, at fair value, being the net present value of the premiums receivable (the EU
revenues). At subsequent balance sheet dates, the financial guarantee liability is measured at the higher
of the expected losses and the amount initially recognised less, when appropriate, the accumulated
amortisation of the revenue. The financial guarantee liability is presented net of the EU revenues still to
be received – zero at 31 December 2017 – see note 2.11.3.

Under the EFSI IIW equity portfolio, which consists of direct equity or quasi equity participations or
subordinated loans, the EIB invests pari-passu at its own risk and also at the risk of the EU.
Consequently, the EU guarantee covers - for the part of the equity investments guaranteed by the EU -
the negative value adjustments (unrealised losses) at each balance sheet date, the realised losses at dis-
investment and the EIB funding costs. In cases where the value of an investment, which was previously
subject to a negative value adjustment, increases at subsequent reporting dates, the amount up to the
original cost of the investment is reimbursed by the EIB to the EU. At the time of the dis-investment, the
EU is also entitled to gains on the investment exceeding the original cost. The EU guarantee is
remunerated by revenues received by the EIB from the guaranteed operations, including interests,
dividends and realised gains. The settlement between the EU and the EIB happens annually net of losses
and revenues.

Under EFSI SMEW equity portfolio, the EU guarantees equity investments in venture capital and private
equity funds, funded by the EIB and originated and managed by the EIF. The EU guarantee is provided
on a portfolio basis for two portfolios: sub-window 1 and sub-window 2. The EFSI guarantee is called to
cover impairment and realised losses from the guaranteed investments and the EIB funding costs. The
EU is entitled to the remuneration for the risk taken in form of dividends and realised gains from the
guaranteed equity operations. Under the sub-window 2, the EU Horizon 2020 programme also partially
invests in the same equity portfolio (the H2020 investment funded by the EU is accounted for as an AFS
financial asset in the EU accounts) and bears first losses from the investments, while further losses are
covered by the EU Guarantee and the EIF.

The EFSI guarantee on the EFSI equity portfolio is classified as a derivative financial instrument and
accounted for as a financial asset or financial liability at fair value through surplus or deficit. At
31 December 2017 the fair value of the EFSI EU guarantee on the EFSI equity portfolio amounted to
EUR 16 million – see note 2.4.2.

The contingent liability above includes operations of the COSME, H2020, CCS and EaSI programmes for
the part covered by the EFSI EU guarantee under SMEW debt portfolio.

EU guarantee payments would be made by the EFSI Guarantee Fund – see note 2.4.1. At the end of
2017 the assets of the guarantee fund totalled EUR 3.5 billion (2016: EUR 1 billion), while another
EUR 2.6 billion (2016: EUR 2.4 billion) have been committed but not yet paid and is included in the
amount disclosed as RAL in note 5.1.

The EU budget guarantees the borrowings of the Commission taken to finance lending to Member and
non-Member States in the back-to-back transactions. These borrowings are already recognised as
liabilities on the EU balance sheet - see note 2.11.1. However, should there be a default on the back-to-
back-loans given out with these borrowings, the EU budget, based on Article 14 of Council Regulation
609/2014, would have to bear the full cost of the amount defaulted:

      •   Borrowings related to loans disbursed under the EFSM are guaranteed solely by the EU budget;

      •   Borrowings related to BOP loans are guaranteed solely by the EU budget;




                                                                                                              75

         •    MFA loans are firstly guaranteed by the Guarantee Fund for external actions (see note 2.4.1) and
              then by the EU budget; and

         •    Guarantees from third-parties are the first cover for the entire amounts of the outstanding
              Euratom loans. The Guarantee Fund would cover the external lending amounts should the third
              party guarantees not provide for them.

     ECSC in Liquidation loans granted on borrowed funds are not covered by an EU budgetary guarantee.
     Instead, they are covered by financial assets of the ECSC in Liquidation – see note 2.4.1.


     4.1.3.     Guarantees given for EU financial instruments

                                                                                                    EUR millions

     As mentioned in Article 140(3) FR, the budgetary expenditure linked to a financial instrument and the
     financial liability of the EU shall in no case exceed the amount of the relevant budgetary commitment
     made for it, thus excluding contingent liabilities for the budget. In practise it means that these liabilities
     have a counter-part on the asset side of the balance sheet or are covered by the outstanding budgetary
     commitments not yet expensed. The contingent liabilities above are shown net of financial provisions
     made for these instruments – see note 2.10.


     4.1.4.     Legal cases

                                                                                                    EUR millions

     Total                                                                           5 463               4 148

     Fines

     These amounts mainly concern fines imposed by the Commission for infringement of competition rules
     that have been provisionally paid by fined companies and where either an appeal has been lodged or
     where it is unknown if an appeal will be made. The contingent liability will be maintained until a decision
     by the Court of Justice on the case is final or until the expiry of the period for appeal. Interest earned on
     provisional payments is included in the economic result of the year and also as a contingent liability to
     reflect the uncertainty of the Commission’s title to these amounts.

     Should the EU lose any of these cases relating to fines imposed, there would be no charge to the EU
     budget since the fines have been provisionally paid and this cash is held either in specific bank accounts
     (see note 2.8) or in the BUFI fund set up for this purpose (see note 2.4.1). The amount of fines are only
     recognised as budgetary revenue when they are definitive (Article 83 FR).

     Agriculture

     These are contingent liabilities towards the Member States connected with EAGF conformity decisions,
     rural development and pre-accession financial corrections pending judgement of the Court of Justice. The
     determination of the final amount of the liability and the year in which the effect of successful appeals will
     be charged to the budget will depend on the length of the procedure before the Court.

Cohesion

These are contingent liabilities towards the Member States in connection with actions under cohesion
policy awaiting the oral hearing date or pending judgement of the Court of Justice.

Other legal cases

This heading relates to actions for damages currently being brought against the EU, other legal disputes
and the estimated legal costs. It should be noted that in an action for damages under Article 288 EC the
applicant must demonstrate a sufficiently serious breach by the institution of a rule of law intended to
confer rights on individuals, real harm suffered by the applicant, and a direct causal link between the
unlawful act and the harm.

     5.       BUDGETARY AND LEGAL COMMITMENTS
     This note provides information on the budgetary process and future funding needs and not on liabilities
     existing as at 31 December 2017.

     The multiannual financial framework (MFF) agreed by the Member States defines the programmes and
     sets out the heading ceilings for commitment appropriations and the total for payment appropriations
     within which the EU may enter into budgetary and legal commitments, and ultimately make payments for
     a period of 7 years – see table 1.1 in the notes to the budgetary implementation reports.

     The MFF ceilings were adopted by the Council (Member States), with the consent of the European
     Parliament, and Article 16 of Regulation 1306/2013 on the financing of the CAP makes a direct link
     between the annual ceiling of EAGF expenditure and the MFF Regulation. The European Parliament and
     the Council also adopted the respective basic acts for the EAGF expenditure that set out the expenditure
     per Member State for the entire period 2014-2020.

     Legal commitments correspond to programmes, projects, agreements or contracts signed, thus legally
     binding the EU. A legal commitment is the act whereby the authorising officer enters or establishes an
     obligation (for the EU) which results in a charge (Article 85 FR).

     A budgetary commitment is in principle made before the legal commitment, but for some multiannual
     programmes/projects it is the reverse, the relevant budgetary commitments being made in annual
     instalments, over several years, when the basic act so provides for. For example, for cohesion, Article 76
     of the Common Provisions Regulation (CPR) (Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013) provides that the decision
     of the Commission adopting a programme shall constitute a legal commitment within the meaning of the
     Financial Regulation but that the budget commitments of the Union in respect of each programme shall
     be made in annual instalments for each Fund during the period between 1 January 2014 and
     31 December 2020. Other legal bases may contain similar provisions. For this reason, there may be
     amounts that the EU has legally committed to pay, but where the budgetary commitment has not yet
     been made – see notes 5.2 and 5.3 below.

     If the budgetary commitment has been made but the subsequent payments are not yet made, the
     amount of outstanding commitments is called "Reste à Liquider" (RAL). This can represent programmes
     or projects, often multiannual, signed but which are not yet (fully) implemented. They represent payment
     obligations for future years. As the financial statements are prepared on an accrual basis, whereas the
     budgetary implementation reports are prepared on a cash basis, part of the overall amounts unpaid
     (RAL) has already been expensed and is recognised as a liability on the balance sheet (see notes 2.12
     and 2.13). The calculation of these expenses is made based either on cost claims/invoices received or on
     the estimated implementation of a programme or project where no claims have been notified yet to the
     EU – see note 5.1 below. Once the payments relating to the RAL are made after 31 December 2017, the
     liability on the balance sheet is derecognised. The part of the RAL not expensed yet is not included under
     liabilities but is instead disclosed below.

     The disclosures below thus represent amounts at 31 December 2017 that the EU has committed to pay
     based on the fulfilment of the contractual agreements and which are therefore intended to be funded by

5.1.        OUTSTANDING BUDGETARY COMMITMENTS NOT YET
            EXPENSED

                                                                                                        EUR millions
                                                                              31.12.2017               31.12.2016
Outstanding budgetary commitments not yet expensed                                 221 391                 189 881

The amount disclosed above is the budgetary RAL ("Reste à Liquider") of EUR 267 258 million (see
table 4.4 in the notes to the budgetary implementation reports), less related amounts that have been
included as liabilities on the balance sheet and as expenses in the statement of financial performance.
The budgetary RAL is an amount representing the open commitments for which payments and/or de-
commitments have not yet been made. As explained above, this is the normal consequence of the
existence of multiannual programmes.

It should be noted that outstanding pre-financing advances at 31 December 2017 totalled EUR 49 billion
(see note 2.5). This represents budgetary commitments that have been paid, decreasing the RAL, but
where the amounts paid are still considered as belonging to the EU and not to the beneficiary until the
contractual commitments are fulfilled. They are thus like the RAL disclosed above, not yet expensed.

These are legal obligations that the EU has committed to paying when adopting the operational
programmes related to shared management. The decision of the Commission adopting an operational
programme shall constitute a financing decision within the meaning of Article 84 FR and once notified to
the Member State concerned, a legal commitment within the meaning of that Regulation.

Article 76 of the CPR for European Structural and Investment Funds (ESIF) states:

"The budget commitments of the Union in respect of each programme shall be made in annual
instalments for each Fund during the period between 1 January 2014 and 31 December 2020. The budget
commitments relating to the performance reserve in each programme shall be made separately from the
remaining allocation to the programme."

The table above starts with the total MFF (column A) and shows the legal commitments for which budget
commitments have not yet been made and, for information, the maximum commitments in relation to
the ceilings foreseen in the MFF 2014-2020, headings 1B, 2 and 3. These legal commitments thus
represent the outstanding amounts that the EU will commit budgetarily and then pay after 31 December

                                                                                                EUR millions

     These amounts reflect the long-term legal commitments that were not yet covered by commitment
     appropriations in the budget at year-end. These binding obligations will be budgeted in annual
     instalments in future years and paid.

     Certain important programmes (see below) may be implemented by annual instalments according to
     Article 85(4) FR. This allows the EU to make legal commitments (sign grant agreements, delegation
     agreements and procurement contracts) in excess of the available commitment appropriations of a given
     year. Therefore a substantial amount of the overall allocation for the current MFF may be already
     committed. This applies in particular for the programmes described below:

     Connecting Europe Facility (CEF)

     The CEF provides financial assistance to trans-European networks in order to support projects of common
     interest in the sectors of transport, telecommunications and energy infrastructures. The legal
     commitments for the CEF programme cover a period running from 2014 until 2020 for the CEF Transport
     and up to 2021 for CEF Energy. The legal basis of these commitments is Regulation (EU) No 1316/2013
     of the EP and of the Council of 11 December 2013 establishing the Connecting Europe Facility, amending
     Regulation (EU) No 913/2010 and repealing Regulations (EC) No 680/2007 and (EC) No 67/2010 Text
     with EEA relevance (OJ L 348, 20 December 2013) which foresees the use of the annual instalment in its
     article 19.

     Copernicus

     Copernicus is the European Earth observation programme – see also note 2.2. These commitments are
     made for the period until 2020. Based on Regulation (EU) 377/2014 of the EP and Council of 3 April 2014
     (OJ L 122/44 of 24 April 2014) the Commission signed delegation agreements with the European Space
     Agency (ESA), EUMETSAT and the European Centre for Medium Range weather forecasts. Article 8 of
     Regulation 377/2014 authorises the use of annual instalments.

     ITER – International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor

     These commitments are intended to cover future funding needs of the ITER facilities up to 2021. The EU
     (Euratom) contribution to ITER International is given through the Fusion for Energy Agency, including
     also the contributions from Member States and from Switzerland. These commitments are made on the
     basis of Council decision (Euratom) 791/2013 of 13 December 2013 amending decision (Euratom)
     198/2007 establishing the European Joint Undertaking for ITER and the Development of Fusion Energy
     which authorises the use of annual instalments. ITER was created to manage and to encourage the
     exploitation of the ITER facilities, to promote public understanding and acceptance of fusion energy, and
     to undertake any other activities that are necessary to achieve its purpose. ITER involves the EU, China,
     India, Russia, South Korea, Japan and the USA.

     Galileo

     These are amounts committed to the Galileo programme developing a European Global Navigation
     Satellite System – see also note 2.2. These commitments are made for the period until 2020. Based on
     Regulation (EU) 1285/2013 of the EP and Council of 11 December 2013 (OJ L 347/1 of

20 December 2013) the Commission signed a delegation agreement with ESA. Article 9 of Regulation
(EU) 1285/2013 authorises the use of annual instalments.

Fisheries agreements

These are commitments entered into up to 2020 with third countries for operations under international
fisheries agreements. These commitments are made based on Council decisions for each third country
(e.g. Council decision (EU) 1894/2015 of 5 October 2015 on the conclusion of the Protocol between the
European Union and the Republic of Cape Verde setting out the fishing opportunities and the financial
contribution provided for in the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Community and
the Republic of Cape Verde; OJ L 277, 22 October 2015). These are specific international treaties which
imply multiannual rights and obligations.

Operating lease commitments

Minimum amounts committed to be paid according to the underlying contracts during the remaining term
of these lease contracts are as follows:

                                                                                           EUR millions

     6.         FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT
     The following disclosures with regard to the financial risk management of the EU relate to:

          •   Borrowing and lending activities for financial assistance carried out by the Commission through:
              EFSM, BOP, MFA, and Euratom actions and for loans from borrowed funds of the ECSC in
              Liquidation;

          •   The treasury operations carried out by the Commission in order to implement the EU budget,
              including the receipt of fines;

          •   Assets held in funds for budgetary guarantees: The Guarantee Fund for external actions and the
              EFSI Guarantee Fund; and

          •   Financial instruments financed by the EU budget.


     6.1.       TYPES OF RISK

     Market risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate,
     because of variations in market prices. Market risk embodies not only the potential for loss, but also the
     potential for gain. It comprises currency risk, interest rate risk and other price risk (the EU has no
     significant other price risk).

          •   Currency risk is the risk that the EU's operations or its investments' value will be affected by
              changes in exchange rates. This risk arises from the change in price of one currency against
              another.

          •   Interest rate risk is the possibility of a reduction in the value of a security, especially a bond,
              resulting from an increase in interest rates. In general, higher interest rates will lead to lower
              prices of fixed rate bonds, and vice versa.

     Credit risk is the risk of loss due to a debtor's/borrower's non-payment of a loan or other line of credit
     (either the principal or interest or both) or other failure to meet a contractual obligation. The default
     events include a delay in repayments, restructuring of borrower repayments and bankruptcy.

     Liquidity risk is the risk that arises from the difficulty in selling an asset; for example, the risk that a
     given security or asset cannot be traded quickly enough in the market to prevent a loss or meet an
     obligation.


     6.2.       RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES

     The implementation of the EU budget relies increasingly on the use of operational programme financial
     instruments. The basic concept behind this approach, in contrast to the traditional method of budget
     implementation by giving grants and subsidies, is that for each euro spent from the budget via financial
     instruments, the final beneficiary receives more than EUR 1 as financial support due to the leverage
     effect. This use of the EU budget maximises the impact of the funds available. For more information on
     the amounts concerned, see note 2.4.1.

     Common to most financial instruments is the fact that the implementation is delegated to either the EIB
     group (including EIF) or to other financial institutions based on an agreement between the Commission
     and the financial institution. Agreements signed with these financial institutions include strict conditions
     and obligations on the intermediaries so as to ensure that EU monies are properly managed and properly
     reported on. Once a financial contribution to one of the instruments has been committed, the funds are
     transferred to a specifically created bank account of the financial institution (i.e. a fiduciary account). The
     financial institution may, depending on the instrument in question, use the funds on this fiduciary account
     to provide loans, issue debt instruments, invest in equity instruments or cover the guarantee calls.
     Proceeds from financial instruments have, as a general rule, to be reimbursed to the EU budget.

     The risk as regards these financial instruments is limited to a ceiling as indicated in the underlying
     agreements, which is the budgeted amount foreseen for the instrument. As the Commission often bears
     the "first loss piece" and since instruments are intended to finance riskier beneficiaries (who have

difficulties in obtaining funding from commercial lenders), it is therefore likely that some losses to the EU
budget will occur.

Measurement of financial instruments

The following classes of financial assets and liabilities are not measured at fair value: cash and cash
equivalents, loans, exchange receivables and non-exchange recoverables, borrowings and other financial
liabilities measured at amortised cost. The carrying amount of those financial assets and liabilities is
considered as a reasonable approximation of their fair value.

Borrowing and lending activities for financial assistance

The borrowing and lending transactions, as well as related treasury management, are carried out by the
EU according to the respective Council and EP Regulation, Council Decisions, and, if applicable, internal
guidelines. Written procedure manuals covering specific areas such as borrowings, loans and treasury
management have been developed and are used by the relevant operational units. As a general rule,
there are no activities to compensate interest rate variations or foreign currency variations ("hedging"
activities) carried-out as lending operations are generally financed by "back-to-back" borrowings, which
thus do not generate open interest rate or currency positions. The application of the "back-to-back"
character is checked regularly.

Treasury

The rules and principles for the management of the Commission's treasury operations are laid down in
the Council Regulation 609/2014 (as amended by Council Regulation 804/2016) and in the Financial
Regulation and its rules of application.

As a result of the above regulations, the following main principles apply:

    •   Own resources are paid by the Member States into accounts opened for this purpose in the name
        of the Commission with the Treasury or national central bank. The Commission may draw on the
        above accounts solely to cover its cash requirements.

    •   Own resources are paid by Member States in their own national currencies, while the
        Commission's payments are mostly denominated in EUR.

    •   Bank accounts opened in the name of the Commission may not be overdrawn. This restriction
        does not apply to the Commission's own resource accounts in case of a default on loans
        contracted or guaranteed pursuant to EU Council regulations and decisions and under certain
        conditions in case the cash resource requirements are in excess of the assets of the accounts.

    •   Funds held in bank accounts denominated in currencies other than EUR are either used for
        payments in the same currencies or periodically converted in EUR.

In addition to the own resources accounts, other bank accounts are opened by the Commission, with
central banks and commercial banks, for the purpose of executing payments and receiving receipts other
than the Member State contributions to the budget.

Treasury and payment operations are highly automated and rely on modern information systems.
Specific procedures are applied to guarantee system security and to ensure segregation of duties in line
with the Financial Regulation, the Commission’s internal control standards, and audit principles.

A written set of guidelines and procedures regulates the management of the Commission's treasury and
payment operations with the objective of limiting operational and financial risk and ensuring an adequate
level of control. They cover different areas of operation (for example: payment execution and cash
management, cashflow forecasting, business continuity, etc.), and compliance with the guidelines and
procedures is checked regularly. Additionally, information is exchanged between Directorate General for
the Budget and Directorate-General for Economic and Financial Affairs on risk management and best
practices.

     Fines

     Provisionally cashed fines: deposits

     Amounts received before 2010 remain in bank accounts with banks specifically selected for the deposit of
     provisionally cashed fines. The selection of banks is conducted in compliance with tender procedures
     defined by the Financial Regulation. Placement of funds with specific banks is determined by the internal
     risk management policy defining the credit rating requirements and the amount of funds which could be
     placed in proportion to the counterparty equity. Financial and operational risks are identified and
     evaluated and compliance with internal policies and procedures is checked regularly.

     Provisionally cashed fines: BUFI portfolio

     Fines imposed and provisionally cashed from 2010 onwards are invested in a specifically created
     portfolio, BUFI. The main objectives of the portfolio are the reduction of risks associated with financial
     markets and the equal treatment of all fined entities by offering a guaranteed return calculated on the
     same basis. The asset management for provisionally cashed fines is carried out by the Commission in
     accordance with internal asset management guidelines. Procedural manuals covering specific areas such
     as treasury management have been developed and are used by the relevant operational units. Financial
     and operational risks are identified and evaluated and compliance with internal guidelines and procedures
     is checked regularly.

     The objectives of the asset management activities are to invest the fines provisionally paid to the
     Commission in such a way as to:

         •   ensure that the funds are easily available when needed, while

         •   aiming at delivering, under normal circumstances, a return which on average is in line with the
             return of the BUFI Benchmark minus costs incurred, while preserving the nominal amount of the
             fines.

     Investments are restricted essentially to the following categories: term deposits with Member States'
     Central Banks, sovereign debt agencies, fully state-owned or state-guaranteed banks or supranational
     institutions, and bonds, bills and Certificates of Deposit issued by either sovereign or supranational
     institutions.

     Financial guarantees

     Significant amounts of guarantees issued by financial institutions are held by the Commission in relation
     to the fines it imposes on companies breaching EU competition rules (see note 2.6.1.2). These
     guarantees are provided by fined companies as an alternative to making provisional payments. The
     guarantees are managed in compliance with the internal risk management policy. Financial and
     operational risks are identified and evaluated and compliance with internal policies and procedures is
     checked regularly.

     Guarantee Fund for external actions

     The rules and principles for the asset management of the Guarantee Fund are laid out in the Convention
     between the Commission and the EIB dated 25 November 1994 and the subsequent amendments dated
     17/23 September 1996, 8 May 2002, 25 February 2008 and 9 November 2010. This Guarantee Fund
     operates only in euros. It exclusively invests in this currency in order to avoid any foreign currency risk.
     Management of the assets is based upon the traditional rules of prudence adhered to for financial
     activities. It is required to pay particular attention to reducing the risks and to ensuring that the managed
     assets can be sold or transferred without significant delay, taking into account the commitments covered.

     EFSI Guarantee Fund

     The EFSI Guarantee Fund was established by Regulation (EU) 2015/1017 of the EP and of the Council of
     25 June 2015 (amended by Regulation (EU) 2017/2396 of 13 December 2017). The rules and principles
     for the asset management of the Fund are laid out in the Commission Decision C(2016)165 of 21 January
     2016. The managed assets shall provide sufficient liquidity in relation to the potential guarantee calls,
     while still aiming at optimising the return and risk level that is compatible with maintaining a high degree
     of security and stability.

     Borrowing and lending activities for financial assistance

     Most financial assets and liabilities are in EUR, so in these cases the EU has no foreign currency risk.
     However, the EU does give loans in USD through the financial instrument Euratom, which are financed by
     borrowings with an equivalent amount in USD (back-to-back operation). At the balance sheet date, the
     EU has no foreign currency risk with regard to Euratom.

     Treasury

     Own resources paid by Member States in currencies other than EUR are kept on the own resources
     accounts, in accordance with Council Regulation 609/2014 (as amended by Council regulation 804/2016).
     They are converted into EUR when they are needed to cover for the execution of payments. The
     procedures applied for the management of these funds are laid down by the above referred regulation. In
     a limited number of cases, these funds are directly used for payments to be executed in the same
     currencies.

     A number of accounts in EU currencies other than EUR, and in USD and CHF, are held by the Commission
     with commercial banks, for the purpose of executing payments denominated in these same currencies.
     These accounts are replenished depending on the amount of payments to be executed, as a consequence
     their balances do not represent exposure to currency risk.

     When miscellaneous receipts (other than own resources) are received in currencies other than EUR, they
     are either transferred to Commission's accounts held in the same currencies, if they are needed to cover
     the execution of payments, or converted into EUR and transferred to accounts held in EUR. Imprest
     accounts held in currencies other than EUR are replenished depending on the estimated short term local
     payments needs in the same currencies. Balances on these accounts are kept within their respective
     ceilings.

     Fines

     Provisionally cashed fines (deposits and BUFI portfolio) and bank guarantees

     Since all fines are imposed and paid in EUR, there is no foreign currency risk.

     Guarantee Fund for external actions

     The financial assets of this fund are in EUR so there is no currency risk. The loans subrogated to the EU
     as result of calls on the Fund following payment defaults by a loan beneficiary are carried out in their
     original currency and therefore expose the EU to currency risk. There are no activities to compensate
     foreign currency variations ("hedging" activities) due to uncertainty relating to the loans repayment

     The EFSI Guarantee Fund currently operates in both EUR and USD. In December 2016 the first
     investments in USD denominated fixed-rate debt securities (US Treasuries) were undertaken with a view
     to improve returns and diversify market risk through exposure to the US market. Currency risk is
     managed through entering into derivative contracts (foreign exchange forward contracts) hedging the

market value of the USD investments portfolio. The limit for maximum unhedged foreign exchange
exposure is set at 1 % of the total portfolio value within the benchmark and annual strategy allocations.
Thus, upward or downward movements in the USD investments' market value above or below the 1 %
limit would trigger a rebalancing trade (a new forward contract with the same or opposite direction),
adjusting or reversing the hedged position accordingly. Readjustment of the hedge may also be prompted
by movements of the EUR/USD exchange rate.

Borrowing and lending activities for financial assistance

Due to the nature of its borrowing and lending activities, the EU has significant interest-bearing assets
and liabilities. However, the interest rate risks that arise from borrowings are offset by equivalent loans
in terms and conditions (back-to-back).

Treasury

The Commission's treasury does not borrow money; so as a consequence, it is not exposed to interest
rate risk. Interest is however calculated on balances held on the different bank accounts. The
Commission has therefore put in place measures to ensure that interest earned on its bank accounts
regularly reflects market interest rates, as well as their possible fluctuation.

Accounts opened with Member States Treasuries for own resources receipts are non-interest bearing and
free of charges. Accounts held with national central banks may be remunerated at the official rates
applied by each institution. As some of the remunerations applied to these accounts may currently be
negative, cash management procedures are in place to minimise balances kept on these accounts.

In addition, own resources accounts are protected from any impact of negative interest in accordance
with Council Regulation 609/2014 and as amended by Council Regulation 804/2016.

Overnight balances held on commercial bank accounts earn interest on a daily basis. This is based on
variable market rates to which a contractual margin (positive or negative) is applied. The rates applied by
commercial banks are in general contractually floored at zero. As a result no risk exists that the
Commission earns interest at rates lower than market rates.

Fines

Provisionally cashed fines (deposits, BUFI portfolio) and bank guarantees

The provisionally cashed fines are invested in a portfolio of money market instruments and long term
bonds with an average duration of 2.6 years.

Guarantee Fund for external actions

The budget provisioned in the Guarantee Fund is invested in a portfolio of money market instruments and
long term bonds with a total average portfolio duration of 2.93 years.

     Receivables and recoverables between 1 and 5 years include recoverables related to competition fines of
     EUR 278 million (2016: EUR 870 million) that are to a large extent covered by bank guarantees and the
     Commission has thus low exposure to a credit risk. These guarantees are provided by fined companies as
     an alternative to making provisional payments.

** Financial assets at fair value through surplus or deficit.
*** Loans and Receivables include recoverables.


Not included in the above table are available for sale financial assets in the form of equity instruments
without external credit rating. The four risk categories mentioned above are in principle based on the
rating categories of external rating agencies and correspond to:

     •    Prime and high grade: Moody P-1, Aaa – Aa3; S&P A-1+, A-1, AAA – AA -; Fitch F1+, F1, AAA –
          AA- and equivalent

     •    Upper medium grade: Moody P-2, A1 – A3; S&P A-2, A+ - A-; Fitch F2, A+ - A- and equivalent

     •    Lower medium grade: Moody P-3, Baa1 – Baa3, S&P A-3, BBB+ - BBB-; Fitch F-3, BBBB+ - BBB-
          and equivalent

     •    Non-investment grade: Moody not prime, Ba1 – C; S&P B, C, BB+ - D; Fitch B, C, BB+ - D and
          equivalent

The EU uses these external agencies rating categories as a reference point notably for financial
instruments and commercial banks, but may, after making its own analysis of individual cases, keep
amounts in one of the above risk categories even though one or more of the above mentioned rating
agencies may have downgraded the corresponding counterparty. As regards non-rated counterparties,
group 1 relates to debtors without defaults in the past and group 2 relates to debtors with defaults in the
past.

The amounts displayed above under loans and receivables categorised in non-investment grade relate
primarily to financial support loans disbursed by the Commission to Member States in financial difficulties
and recoverables against certain Members States based on own resources regulations or other legal
basis. The amount under cash relates to own resources bank accounts opened in the Treasury or in the
central banks of Member States to hold the own resources contributions as foreseen in the above referred
regulation. The Commission may draw on these accounts solely to cover cash requirements arising from
execution of the budget.

Borrowing and lending activities for financial assistance

Exposure to credit risk is managed firstly by obtaining country guarantees in the case of Euratom, then
through the Guarantee Fund for external actions (MFA & Euratom), then by the possibility of drawing the
necessary funds from the Commission's own resources accounts with the Member States and ultimately
through the Budget of the EU.

The Own Resources legislation fixes the ceiling for own resources payments at 1.20 % of Member States'
GNI and during 2017 0.76 % was actually used to cover payment appropriations. This means that at
31 December 2017 there existed an available margin of 0.44 % to cover these guarantees. To this end,
the EU is entitled to call upon all the Member States to ensure compliance with the EU's legal obligation
towards its lenders.

                                       Annual accounts of the European Union 2017

     Treasury

     Most of the Commission's treasury resources are kept, in accordance with Council Regulation 609/2014
     (as amended by Council Regulation 804/2016) on own resources, in the accounts opened by Member
     States for the payment of their contributions (own resources). All such accounts are held with Member
     States' treasuries or national central banks. These institutions carry the lowest credit (or counterparty)
     risk for the Commission as the exposure is with its Member States. For the part of the Commission's
     treasury resources kept with commercial banks, in order to cover the execution of payments,
     replenishment of these accounts is made on a just-in-time basis and is automatically managed by the
     treasury cash management system. Minimum cash levels, which take into account the average amount of
     daily payments executed from it, are kept on each account. As a consequence the total amount kept
     overnight on these accounts remains constantly at low levels (overall less than EUR 80 million on
     average, spread over 21 accounts) and so ensure the Commission's risk exposure is limited. These
     amounts should be viewed with regard to the daily overall treasury balances which fluctuated in 2017
     between EUR 4 billion and EUR 40 billion, and with an overall amount of payments made from
     Commission accounts in 2017 that exceeds EUR 134 billion.

     In addition, specific guidelines are applied for the selection of commercial banks in order to further
     minimise counterparty risk to which the Commission is exposed:

         •   All commercial banks are selected by call for tenders. The minimum short term credit rating
             required for admission to the tendering procedures is Moody's P-1 or equivalent. A lower level
             may be accepted in specific and duly justified circumstances.

         •   The credit ratings of the commercial banks where the Commission has accounts are monitored on
             a daily basis.

         •   In delegations outside the EU, imprest accounts are held with local banks selected by a simplified
             tendering procedure. Rating requirements depend on the local situation and may significantly
             differ from one country to another. In order to limit risk exposure, balances on these accounts
             are kept at the lowest possible levels (taking into account operational needs), they are regularly
             replenished, and the applied ceilings are reviewed on a yearly basis.

     Banks holding deposits for the fines provisionally cashed before 2010 are selected by tender procedure in
     compliance with the risk management policy which defines the credit rating requirements and the amount
     of funds which could be placed in proportion to the counterparty equity.

     For commercial banks that have been specifically selected for the deposit of provisionally cashed fines, a
     minimum long-term rating A (S&P or equivalent) and a minimum short term rating A-1 (S&P or
     equivalent) is required as a general rule. Specific measures are applied in case banks in this group are
     subject to downgrade. In addition, the amount deposited with each bank is limited to a certain
     percentage of its own funds, which varies depending on the rating level of each institution. The
     calculation of such limits also takes into account the amount of outstanding guarantees issued to the
     Commission by the same institution. The compliance of outstanding deposits with the applicable policy
     requirements is reviewed regularly.

     Provisionally cashed fines: BUFI portfolio

     For sovereign debt investments from provisionally cashed fines imposed as from 2010, the Commission
     takes on the exposure to credit risk. The highest concentration of exposure is towards France, which
     represents 26 % of the portfolio. The five countries with the highest exposure (France, Italy, Spain,
     Germany and Belgium) represent altogether 72 % of the investment portfolio. The weighted average
     credit rating of the portfolio is A- (S&P or equivalent).

     Financial guarantees

     The risk management policy applied for the acceptance of such guarantees ensures a high credit quality
     for the Commission. The compliance of the outstanding guarantees with the applicable policy
     requirements is reviewed regularly.

Guarantee Fund for external actions

The treasury portfolio’s agreed asset management guidelines and/or investment strategy define certain
limits and restrictions in order to limit the exposure to credit risk of the portfolio. Such limits and
restrictions include eligibility criteria, absolute credit limits in nominal terms depending on issuer
category, relative concentration limits depending on issuer category and concentration limits per issue.
All investments are rated at least as investment grade.

EFSI Guarantee Fund

The asset management guidelines, risk and investment strategies define certain limits and restrictions in
order to limit the exposure to credit risk of the portfolio which is generally limited to investment grade.
The weighted average credit rating of the portfolio is A- (S&P or equivalent).

As the sole counterparty for all outstanding currency forwards as of 31 December 2017 is the Bank for
International Settlements (BIS), no credit enhancements, such as collateral, netting agreements, or
guarantees are put in place as of this date. The maximum exposure to credit risk for foreign exchange
derivatives having a positive fair value at the end of the reporting period is equal to the carrying amount
on the balance sheet.

Borrowing and lending activities for financial assistance

The liquidity risk that arises from borrowings is generally offset by equivalent loans in terms and
conditions (back-to-back operations). For MFA and Euratom, the Guarantee Fund for external actions
serves as a liquidity reserve (or safety net) in case of payment default and payment delays of borrowers.
For BOP, the Council Regulation 431/2009 provides for a procedure allowing sufficient time to mobilise
funds through the Commission's own resources accounts with the Member States. For EFSM, the Council
Regulation 407/2010 provides for a similar procedure.

Treasury

EU budget principles ensure that overall cash resources for a given year are always sufficient for the
execution of all payments. In fact, the total Member States contributions equal the amount of payment
appropriations for the budgetary year. Member States’ contributions, however, are received in twelve
monthly instalments throughout the year, while payments are subject to certain seasonality. Moreover, in
accordance with the Council Regulation 609/2014 (on the methods and procedure for making available
own resources amended by Council Regulation 804/2016), Member States contributions relating to
(amending) budgets approved after the 16th of a given month (N) only become available in month N+2,

                                                                                                              91
-----------------------Page 93 End-----------------------

                                       Annual accounts of the European Union 2017

     while the related payment appropriations are immediately available. In order to ensure that available
     treasury resources are always sufficient to cover the payments to be executed in any given month,
     procedures regarding regular cash forecasting are in place, and own resources or additional funding can
     be called up in advance from Member States if needed, up to certain limits and under certain conditions.
     Seasonality of expenditure and overall budgetary restrictions in recent years have resulted in the need
     for increased monitoring of the rhythm of payments over the year. In addition to the above, in the
     context of the Commission's daily treasury operations, automated cash management tools ensure that
     sufficient liquidity is available on each of the Commission's bank accounts, on a daily basis.

     Fines

     Provisionally cashed fines: BUFI portfolio

     The fund is managed according to the principle that the assets shall have a sufficient degree of liquidity
     and mobilisation in relation to the relevant commitments. The portfolio is composed of mostly highly
     liquid securities that can be sold to meet unexpected cash outflows. In addition the share of deposits,
     securities maturing within 1 year and floating rate notes is 38 %.

     Guarantee Fund for external actions

     The fund is managed according to the principle that the assets shall have a sufficient degree of liquidity
     and mobilisation in relation to the relevant commitments. The fund must maintain a minimum of
     EUR 100 million in a short-term portfolio with a maturity of less than twelve months which is to be
     invested in monetary instruments. As at 31 December 2017, these investments, including cash,
     amounted to EUR 244 million. Furthermore, a minimum of 20 % of the fund's nominal value shall
     comprise monetary instruments, fixed-rate bonds with a remaining maturity of no more than one year,
     and floating-rate bonds. As at 31 December 2017, this ratio stood at 23 %.

     EFSI Guarantee Fund

     The Guarantee Fund is managed according to the principle that the assets shall have a sufficient degree
     of liquidity and mobilisation in relation to the relevant commitments. The portfolio is composed of highly
     liquid assets that can be sold to meet unexpected cash outflows, including the most liquid USD-
     denominated securities – US Treasuries standing at 16 % of the total investment portfolio as of the
     reporting date.

     The settlement of derivative contracts is gross and is based on their contractual maturity. Obligations are
     honoured via sales of USD-denominated assets and/or a swap transaction, whereby it is possible that a
     cash outflow arises due to foreign exchange differences.

     No liquidity management is necessary with regard to collateral/margin requirements as the current
     hedging counterparty accepts to operate with the Commission without any requirements for
     collateral/margin calls.

     Other financial instruments – foreign exchange option

     During the year ended 31 December 2017, the EU entered into a derivative contract (foreign exchange
     option) covering the devaluation of foreign exchange currency related to loans given by financial
     institutions (see note 2.11.2). As for the other financial instruments financed by the EU Budget, the
     amount for which the EU is liable under this option cannot exceed the amount committed, being the
     liquidity risk mitigated by that fact.

8.       EVENTS AFTER THE BALANCE SHEET DATE
At the date of signing of these accounts no material issues had come to the attention of or were reported
to the Accounting Officer of the Commission that would require separate disclosure under this section. As
explained in note 4.1.1, the EFSI Agreement has been amended in March 2018 following the amended
Regulation EU 2017/2396.

The accounts and related notes were prepared using the most recently available information and this is
reflected in the information presented.

                                      Annual accounts of the European Union 2017

      The objective of this Financial Statement Discussion and Analysis (FSDA) is to assist readers to
      understand the financial position, financial performance and cash flows presented in the consolidated
      financial statements of the EU. The information presented in this FSDA has not been audited.


      1. CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE
         EU: FINANCIAL SITUATION 2017

      1.1.     REVENUE

      The consolidated revenue of the EU incorporates amounts related to exchange transactions and non-
      exchange transactions, the latter being the most significant.

      The table below provides an overview of the main categories of non-exchange transactions.

      Five year trend of revenue from main non-exchange transactions (in EUR millions)


                  160 000

                  140 000

                  120 000

                  100 000                                                      Recovery of expenses
                                                                               Fines
                   80 000
                                                                               VAT
                   60 000                                                      TOR
                                                                               GNI resources
                   40 000

                   20 000

                        -
                             2013     2014     2015      2016      2017


      In 2017 the consolidated revenue fell 7 %, to EUR 136.2 billion, when compared to the previous year,
      mainly due to the following:

         •   a decrease of EUR 17 billion in the GNI resources, or 18 % when compared to previous year. This
             effect can be seen in the above table and primarily reflects the impact of the reduction of
             payment appropriations for the 2017 budget. The GNI resource is used to finance the part of the
             budget not covered by any other source of revenue; and

         •   the decrease above was partially compensated by 'other revenue' for non-exchange transactions
             which includes the impact of the budget surplus from 2016, presented under the budgetary
             adjustment line, to the amount of EUR 6.4 billion. This budget surplus was large due to the
             under-implementation of programmes in 2016, as explained in the note 2.2 of the budgetary
             implementation report of 2016. This is a mechanism that indirectly refunds the Member States as
             it deducts the amount of own resources of the following year (in this case reduced for the
             financial year of 2017), for that reason the budget surplus is recognised as revenue.

1.2.     EXPENSES

The main component of expenses recognised in the consolidated financial statements is transfer
payments under the shared management mode, which includes the following funds: (i) European
Agricultural Guarantee Fund (EAGF); (ii) EAFRD and other rural development instruments; (iii) ERDF &
CF; and (iv) European Social Fund (ESF).

These funds made up almost 63 % of total expenses in the year ended in 31 December 2017 - the split
can be found in the chart below.

                               9%




                      22%                                                       EAGF

                                                                                ERDF / CF
                                                                     55%
                                                                                ESF



                               14%




Expenses incurred under direct management represent the budget implementation by the Commission,
executive agencies and by trust funds. Under indirect management the budget is implemented by EU
agencies, EU bodies, third countries, international organisations and other entities.

Overall, the expenses incurred under direct and indirect management made up about 19 % of total
expenses (EUR 24 billion) and remained stable compared to the previous financial year.

The EU recognises future payment obligations as expenses even if they are not yet shown in the cash-
based budgetary accounts. The important amounts are shown under payables and accrued charges for
agriculture and rural development and under pension and employee benefits liabilities relating to pension
rights acquired by Commissioners, MEPs and staff.

The amount of the consolidated expenses decreased by 11 %, to EUR 128.1 billion, when compared with
2016, mainly resulting from the following effects:

   •   expenses under the ERDF & CF decreased by circa 50 %, or by the amount of EUR 17.4 billion,
       due to fewer expenses incurred relating to the previous programming period (2007-2013); and

   •   for the same reason, expenses under European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD)
       and other rural development instruments also decreased by EUR 1.2 billion.

      1.3.     ASSETS

      The most significant items on the asset side of the balance sheet relate to financial assets (loans,
      available for sale financial assets, cash) and pre-financing amounts, which make up circa 85 % of the
      assets of the EU.

                                                                        Receivables and recoverables

                                                                        Property, Plant & Equipment
                 27%
                                                                        Other
                                                               8%


                                             15%


      As at 31 December 2017 the total assets were EUR 166.2 billion, reflecting an increase of approximately
      2 %. The key changes were:

         •   an increase of EUR 3.6 billion in pre-financing stemming from small increases in most policy
             areas;

         •   an increase of EUR 2.5 billion in financial instruments relating to the endowment of the Guarantee
             Fund for EFSI operations. This fund has been established to provide a liquidity cushion against
             potential losses incurred by the EIB in relation to its financing and investment operations eligible
             for the EFSI EU guarantee under the EFSI Agreement. It will be progressively provisioned and will
             gradually reach EUR 9.1 billion, which intends to cover 35 % of the total future EU EFSI
             guarantee obligations; and

         •   an increase of EUR 0.7 billion in Property, plant and equipment (PPE) which relates to further
             developments of the space assets (Galileo and Copernicus).

      In general, the EU institutions and bodies strive to keep the amounts held as cash and cash equivalents
      at a low level. The cash balance of EUR 24.1 billion at year-end is lower than in 2016 and is made up of
      the following main elements:

         •   Own resources; the end of year balance includes a total net amount of EUR 8.9 billion to be
             returned to Member States in early 2018 as result of amending budgets adopted late in 2017;

         •   Fines imposed by the Commission for breach of competition rules of EUR 0.5 billion definitively
             cashed late in 2017 are also part of the year-end treasury balance; and

         •   The treasury balance also includes the assigned revenue and payment appropriations of
             EUR 8.4 billion.

Pre-financing

It should be noted that the level of pre-financing is significantly influenced by the MFF cycle – for
example at the beginning of an MFF period one can expect large advances to be paid to Member States
under cohesion policy. The Commission makes every effort to ensure that the levels of pre-financing are
maintained at an appropriate level. A balance has to be struck between ensuring sufficient funding for the
projects and the timely recognition of expenditure.

The total pre-financing (excluding other advances to Member States and contributions to the trust funds
Bekou and Africa) on the EU balance sheet amounts to EUR 44.3 billion (2016: EUR 41.6 billion), almost
all of which relates to Commission activities. Some 61 % of the Commission's pre-financing concerns
shared management, which means that the implementation of the budget is delegated to Member States
(the Commission retains a supervisory role).

The most significant pre-financing amount under shared management mode relates to ERDF & Cohesion
Fund (EUR 14.9 billion).

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The following items are shown in accounting terms as financial instruments in the consolidated financial
statements of the EU:

   •   Financial Instruments financed by the EU budget: under this type of budget implementation funds
       are either already disbursed to the fiduciary accounts managed by the entrusted entities and stay
       available (as cash and cash equivalents and debt securities) to cover future guarantee calls or
       have been invested in equity;

   •   Financial assets held in guarantee funds for budgetary guarantees: under this type of budget
       implementation the EU provides guarantees to entrusted entities for which the funding is only
       partially provisioned via guarantee funds set-up by the Commission and thus creating contingent
       liabilities for the EU budget – see note 3.3; and

   •   Loans and related borrowings for financial assistance programmes.

Financial instruments financed by the EU budget

The significance and volume of financial instruments financed by the EU budget under direct and indirect
management increases from year to year. The basic concept behind this approach, in contrast to the
traditional method of budget implementation by giving grants and subsidies, is that for each euro spent

      consolidated financial statements) given to the EIB group. These guarantee funds are provisioned by
      payments from the EU budget so as to provide a liquidity cushion against potential losses from
      guaranteed operations. Payments to the guarantee funds are invested in financial instruments including
      debt securities, cash and term deposits. At 31 December 2017, the Commission holds financial assets in
      the:

           •   Guarantee Fund for external actions of EUR 2.4 billion; and

           •   EFSI Guarantee Fund of EUR 3.5 billion.


      Loans and related borrowings for financial assistance programmes

      Financial support for Member States and third countries in the form of bilateral loans financed from the
      capital markets with the guarantee of the EU budget is provided by the Commission under decisions of
      the European Parliament and of the Council.

      The Commission, acting on behalf of the EU, currently operates three main programmes:

           •   European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism (EFSM);
           •   Balance of Payments (BOP) assistance; and
           •   Macro-financial assistance (MFA), under which it may grant loans.

      The capital required to fund the EU lending is raised on the capital markets or with financial institutions.

      At 31 December 2017, the nominal amount of the loans granted for financial assistance under the EFSM
      and BOP were:


                                                                                                                  EUR billions

      EFSM

      EFSM was created to provide financial assistance to all Member States experiencing or seriously
      threatened with a severe economic financial disturbance caused by exceptional occurrences beyond their
      control. The EFSM was used to provide financial assistance, conditional on the implementation of reforms,
      to Ireland and Portugal between 2011 and 2014.

      This programme expired and no additional loans can be drawn, though it remains in place for specific
      tasks such as the lengthening of maturities for loans to Ireland and Portugal and providing bridging loans.

                                   Annual accounts of the European Union 2017

The main points of the EFSM programme are as follows:

Ireland

   •      Ireland requested the full total of EUR 22.5 billion granted by the EFSM in December 2010. This
          amount was disbursed in eight instalments between January 2011 and March 2014;

   •      Ireland has the option to lengthen the maturity of the EFSM loans based on the extension of the
          maximum weighted average maturity; and

   •      The first repayment of EUR 3.4 billion was scheduled for April 2018. However, Ireland has
          requested a maturity extension, which was approved and successfully borrowed in the markets in
          the first quarter of 2018 and this amount has been rescheduled for repayment in two instalments
          of EUR 2.4 billion and EUR 1 billion in 2025 and 2033 respectively. The second repayment of
          EUR 0.5 billion is scheduled for October 2018 but again with the possibility of extending the
          maturity.

Portugal

   •      Portugal has requested EUR 24.3 billion from a total of EUR 26 billion granted by the EFSM in May
          2011. This amount was disbursed in seven instalments between May 2011 and November 2014;
          and

   •      The first repayment of EUR 0.6 billion is scheduled for October 2018 but, as in the case of
          Ireland, Portugal has the possibility of extending the maturity.

BOP

The BOP is an assistance programme designed for countries outside the euro area that are experiencing
or threatened by difficulties regarding their balance of payments. BOP assistance takes the form of
medium-term loans that are conditional on the implementation of policies designed to address underlying
economic problems. Typically, balance of payments assistance from the EU is offered in cooperation with
the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and other international institutions or countries.

The EU medium-term financial assistance under the BOP facility was activated in November 2008 to help
Hungary and subsequently Latvia and Romania, in January and May 2009, to restore market confidence
for a total commitment of EUR 14.6 billion. The BOP assistance programme for Hungary expired in 2010
and has been fully repaid in 2016. Both assistance programmes for Latvia and Romania expired in 2012,
hence no additional instalments can be disbursed.

Additionally, the two precautionary assistance programmes for Romania expired in 2013 and 2015
respectively without being drawn down.

The main points are as follows:

   •      During 2017, the beneficiary Member States of BOP have reimbursed timely and fully a total
          amount of EUR 1.3 billion out of which EUR 1.2 billion related to a capital reimbursement from
          Romania, being the remaining related to interests; and

   •      In April 2018, Romania made a capital repayment of EUR 1.2 billion and is expected to make
          further capital reimbursements EUR 0.1 billion in October 2018.

MFA

The MFA is a form of financial aid extended by the EU to partner countries outside the EU experiencing a
balance of payments crisis. It takes the form of medium/long-term loans or grants, or a combination of
these, and is only available to countries benefiting from a disbursing IMF programme.

The outstanding loans at 31 December 2017 under the MFA programme were EUR 3.9 billion at nominal
amounts.

      1.4.      LIABILITIES

      The most significant items on the liability side of the balance sheet consists primarily of four key items:
      (i) pension obligation and other employee benefits liabilities; (ii) borrowings; (iii) payables to third parties
      and (iv) accrued charges.

                                                                              Payables


                                                                              Accrued charges & deferred
                                                                              income
                                 17%                                          Other liabilities
                                                   23%




      As at 31 December 2017 the total liabilities were EUR 236.5 billion, reflecting an increase of approx. 1 %
      when compared to the previous year.
      The key changes were related to the following effects in:

          •   The increase in the total employee benefits liability of EUR 5.9 billion is primarily due to an
              increase in the net liability of the Pension Scheme of European Officials;

          •   Provisions rose by EUR 1 billion as a consequence of an updated study on JRC dismantlement
              provision which led to a higher estimate of the obligation. The change relates to the main input of
              the calculation – the timeframe – that was previously calculated around 20 years and now
              updated to 40 years; and
          •   Accrued expenses fell by EUR 3.7 billion, which partially compensate the above effects. This
              decrease in the accrued expenses was due to the fact that the cohesion programmes of the
              previous MFF are well advanced in the closure phase.


      Overall all other items of the liability remained stable. It is important to note that financial liabilities
      decreased in the long-term, due to the decrease of borrowings, coupled with an increase of the short
      term part, this impact is due to BOP and EFSM repayments in 2018 from Romania (EUR 1.35 billion),
      Ireland (EUR 3.9 billion) and Portugal (EUR 0.6 billion) as expected at the reporting date.

Net assets

The excess of liabilities over assets does not mean that the EU institutions and bodies are in financial
difficulties, rather it means that certain liabilities will be funded by future annual budgets. Many expenses
are recognised under accrual accounting rules in 2017 although they may be actually paid in 2018 or
later and funded using future budgets and the related revenues will only be accounted for in future
periods. The most significant amounts to be highlighted are the EAGF activities (paid in 2018) and the
employee benefits liability (to be paid over the next 30 plus years).




2. PROTECTION OF THE EU BUDGET
Financial corrections and recoveries overview for 2017

An important consideration in implementing the EU budget is the need to ensure the proper prevention or
detection and subsequent correction of system weaknesses leading to errors, irregularities and fraud. The
Court of Auditors provides in its annual report a statement of assurance on the legality and regularity of
transactions underlying the annual accounts, as well as the material level of error in payments. The
statement of assurance accompanies the EU annual accounts in its publication in the Official Journal.

The Commission's protective actions mitigate the impact of these errors through two main mechanisms:
     (1) preventive mechanisms (e.g. ex-ante controls, interruptions and suspensions of payments);
         and
     (2) corrective mechanisms (primarily financial corrections imposed on or agreed with Member
         States and recoveries from recipients of EU payments).

Under the shared management mode (agricultural spending and structural actions), Member States are
primarily responsible throughout the expenditure life cycle for ensuring that expenditure paid out from
the EU budget is legal and regular.

The protective actions arise following the supervision and checks made by both the Commission and also,
in the case of shared management expenditure, Member States on the eligibility of expenditure funded
by the EU budget. When deciding on the amount of a financial correction or recovery, the Commission
takes into account the nature and seriousness of the breach of applicable law and the financial
implications for the EU budget, including cases of deficiencies in management and control systems.

      Financial corrections and recoveries are presented at two main stages of the process. Both stages may
      take place in the same year or in different years:
            (1) Financial corrections and recoveries at confirmation stage: These amounts have been either
            agreed by the Member State concerned or adopted by a Commission decision. In 2017, the total
            financial corrections and recoveries confirmed amounted to EUR 2 662 million (2016:
            EUR 3 777 million), of which EUR 1 826 million resulting from corrective actions.

            (2) Financial corrections and recoveries at implementation stage: These amounts represent the
            final step of the process whereby the observed situation of undue expenditure is definitively
            corrected. Several implementation mechanisms are foreseen in the sector-based regulatory
            frameworks. In 2017, the total financial corrections and recoveries implemented amounted to
            EUR 2 845 million (2016: EUR 3 389 million), of which EUR 1 949 million resulting from corrective
            actions. The implementation of financial corrections and recoveries may take a number of years
            mainly due to instalment or deferral decisions granted to Member States under the agricultural
            policy. Under the Cohesion policy the legal framework foresees the implementation at or after the
            closure of the programming period.

3. MANAGEMENT OF RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES OF
   EU BUDGET IMPLEMENTATION

3.1.       MACRO-ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT

The macro-economic environment of the EU9 has an impact on the ability of EU Member states to meet
their funding obligations towards the EU institutions and bodies and thus on the ability of the EU to
continue implementing EU policies.

While the broad-based acceleration of global economic activity and trade over the course of last year
benefitted the euro area, domestic demand also strengthened, enhanced by above-average business and
consumer sentiment, continued policy support, and improving labour markets. The European economy
therefore looks set to continue expanding at a solid pace. Robust job creation is expected to continue
providing fuel for consumer spending growth. At the same time, investment conditions are set to remain
favourable with both domestic and foreign demand expected to strengthen and financing conditions
expected to remain loose. The remaining slack in the economy should allow for GDP to continue growing
at rates that are higher than the estimated rate of potential growth (around 1.5 %) throughout the
forecast horizon. The cyclical momentum in the euro area, however, is forecast to moderate slightly over
the course of 2018 as the brisk pace of employment growth starts to ease.

Euro area and EU GDP is estimated to have grown by 2.4 % in 2017 and is forecast to grow by 2.3 % in
2018 before easing somewhat to 2.0 % in 2019.

While labour market conditions have improved across all Member States, unemployment rates continue
to vary significantly. Nevertheless, the forecast for GDP growth has been revised up for a large majority
of euro area Member States in each of the years covered by the forecast and growth rates are expected
to converge further. Due to remaining slack in the labour market, wage pressures and core inflation are
expected to rise only gradually. Temporary factors related to energy prices will therefore continue to play
a major role in inflation developments and will maintain the headline harmonised indices of consumer
prices (HICP) inflation rate above core inflation over much of 2018. After 1.5 % in 2017, HICP inflation is
forecast to average 1.5 % over 2018 before edging-up to 1.6 % in 2019.

Risks to the outlook for GDP and inflation remain broadly balanced. While there appears to be room for
growth to exceed expectations in the coming quarters, this could lead to growth-limiting supply-side
constraints kicking in earlier than otherwise expected. At the same time, benign market expectations
concerning asset price valuations appear vulnerable to a re-assessment of sentiment and fundamentals.
Risks related to the UK's vote to leave the EU remain, as do downside risks associated with geopolitical
tensions and a shift towards more inward looking and protectionist policies.

Momentum in the global economy remains strong, as the broad-based cyclical upswing continues, buoyed
by the rebound in investment and trade, still favourable financial conditions and a supportive policy mix.
Higher commodity prices are also proving supportive for commodity exporters. The near-term outlook is
slightly stronger than projected in autumn 2017, with global GDP growth outside the EU now expected at
4.1 % in both 2018 and 2019, compared to 3.8 % in 2017.



3.2. BUDGETARY CONTINGENT LIABILITIES FOR
     FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE

The EU borrowing and lending activities for financial assistance programmes are non-budget operations.
In general, funds raised are on-lent back-to-back to the beneficiary country, i.e. with the same coupon,
maturity and amount. Notwithstanding the back-to-back methodology, the debt service of the funding
instruments is a legal obligation of the EU, which will ensure that all payments are made fully and in a
timely manner. The Commission has put procedures in place to ensure the repayment of borrowings even
in case of a loan default.

      Borrowings of the EU constitute direct and unconditional obligations of the EU and are guaranteed by the
      EU Member States (budgetary contingent liabilities). Borrowings undertaken to fund loans to countries
      outside the EU are covered by the Guarantee Fund for external actions. Should a beneficiary Member
      State default, the debt service will be drawn from the available treasury balance of the Commission, if
      possible. If that would not be possible, the Commission would draw the necessary funds from the
      Member States. EU Member States are legally obliged, according to the EU own resources legislation
      (Article 14 of Council Regulation 609/2014), to make available sufficient funds to meet the EU’s
      obligations. Thus investors are only exposed to the credit risk of the EU, not to that of the beneficiary of
      loans funded. “Back-to-back” lending ensures that the EU budget does not assume any interest rate or
      foreign exchange risk.

      For each country programme, the EP, the Council and the Commission decisions determine the overall
      granted amount, the number of instalments to be disbursed, and the maximum (average) maturity of the
      loan package. Subsequently, the Commission and the beneficiary country agree the loan/funding
      parameters, in particular the maturity of instalments. In addition, except for the first one, all instalments
      of the loan depend on compliance with policy conditions, in the context of a joint EU/International
      Monetary Fund (IMF) financial assistance, which is another factor influencing the timing of funding
      operations. This implies that the timing and maturities of issuances are dependent on the related EU
      lending activity. Funding is exclusively denominated in euro and the maturity spectrum is from 3 to 30
      years.

3.3. CONTINGENT LIABILITIES RELATING TO BUDGETARY
     GUARANTEES

The EU has given guarantees to the EIB Group on loans granted outside of the EU and on debt and equity
operations covered by the EFSI guarantee. At 31 December 2017, the EU shows in the notes to its
consolidated financial statements (see note 4.1.1) contingent liabilities for both guarantees. In order to
mitigate the risk guarantee calls by the EIB Group could have on the EU budget, the EU has created
dedicated guarantee funds, i.e. the Guarantee Fund for external actions and the EFSI Guarantee Fund.

The Guarantee Fund for external actions is provisioned by the EU budget so as to cover 9 % of the
guaranteed loans for EIB external lending mandate activities to third countries outstanding at year-end.
At 31 December 2017, the total asset value of EUR 2.2 billion covers an exposure of amounts disbursed
of EUR 20 billion, amounts signed of EUR 28.9 billion, and a ceiling of EUR 37.5 billion.

The EFSI Guarantee Fund started its activity in 2016 and was initially expected to be financed out of a
total of 50 % a maximum exposure of EUR 16 billion of the EU, thus the fund should gradually (by 2022)
reach EUR 8 billion. In December 2017, the EFSI Regulation has been amended, as result, the maximum
EU EFSI guarantee was increased up to EUR 26 billion, and the boundary for the guarantee fund
decreased to 35 %. Therefore, based on the impact of the amendment the EFSI Guarantee Fund is now
expected to reach the total amount of EUR 9.1 billion.

The total assets that make up the EFSI Guarantee Fund at 31 December 2017 is EUR 3.5 million and that
covers an exposure of disbursed amounts of EUR 10.1 billion and of amounts signed of EUR 13.5 billion
(including amounts disbursed). The EFSI Guarantee Fund currently operates in both EUR and USD.


3.4.      BOOST FOR JOBS, GROWTH AND INVESTMENT

Investment Plan for Europe

In 2015 the Commission, together with the EIB, launched the Investment Plan for Europe, which includes
the European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI), created with an initial EUR 21 billion of EU money
and with the key aim of attracting private investment. Forecasts point to an additional 700 000 jobs and
a 0.7 % increase in the EU’s gross domestic product by 2020 thanks to the investments approved in 2015
and 2016. This shows that, even in sectors and regions hard hit by the crisis a decade ago, strategic
investment is boosting jobs and growth across the EU. Following the agreement in principle reached by
the European Parliament and Member States in September, the Parliament voted in December to adopt a
Regulation extending and enhancing the European Fund for Strategic Investments. The timeline of the
new and improved EFSI 2.0 has been extended from mid-2018 to the end of 2020, and its investment
target has been increased from EUR 315 billion to at least EUR 500 billion.

In 2017 the Fund remained firmly on track to mobilise at least EUR 315 billion in additional investments
in the real economy by mid-2018. It was active in all 28 Member States and was expected to trigger
around EUR 256 billion in total investments by the end of 2017.

A total of 357 infrastructure and innovation projects, representing financing of EUR 39.2 billion, had been
approved under the Fund by the end of the year. In addition, 347 financing agreements for small and
medium-sized enterprises, worth EUR 11.9 billion, had been approved. Around 539 000 such businesses
were expected to benefit from this.

In addition, advisory support for project development and preparation was stepped up through the
European Investment Advisory Hub, and projects looking for financing were given the necessary visibility
on the European Investment Project Portal.

The European Fund for Strategic Investments supports investment in sectors of strategic importance to
the EU economy, including energy, transport, digital technologies, research, development and innovation,
environment and resource efficiency, social infrastructure and small companies. This includes investment
in social entrepreneurship, social impact and social innovation.

      Continuing Support for EU member States

      The Structural Reform Support Programme was set up in May 2017 with a budget of EUR 142.8 million
      for the 2017-2020 period. At the request of Member States the Programme finances tailor-made technical
      support to help them in the key areas of their reform efforts. Through the Programme the Commission
      provides targeted support that reinforces the capacity of Member States to design and implement
      reforms they consider necessary to make their economies more competitive and investment friendly. This
      technical support covers reforms in the areas of governance and public administration, public financial
      management, the business environment, labour markets, education, health and social services, the
      financial sector and access to finance. It is available to all EU Member States, is demand driven and
      requires no co-financing.

      The Programme is implemented by the Structural Reform Support Service, in cooperation with other
      relevant Commission departments. So far the Service has engaged with 15 Member States to carry out
      more than 150 support projects. Under the 2018 project cycle it has received more than 400 requests for
      support from over 20 Member States, leading to substantial excess demand for the Programme’s budget,
      which is set at EUR 30.5 million for the year.

      The EU continued to provide post-programme support to Ireland, Spain, Cyprus, Portugal and Romania.
      Good progress was again made in the course of the year in implementing the Greek programme, which
      was designed to create the conditions for the return of confidence and to lay the foundations for a lasting
      economic recovery in Greece. The second review was concluded in July, allowing the third tranche of
      funding from the European Stability Mechanism, amounting to EUR 8.5 billion, to be authorised. The third
      review was ongoing in December, and a staff-level agreement was reached early in that month. Greece
      also continued to receive economic support through the Investment Plan for Europe.

      The Structural Reform Support Service has also taken up special assignments to help coordinate the
      response to the refugee crisis in Greece and to implement the EU Aid Programme for the Turkish Cypriot
      community.


      3.5.      NEW ENTRANTS' RESERVE (NER) 300

      The NER 300 fund originates from the sale of the Emission Trading Scheme allowances and belongs to
      the Member States who use the money to finance innovative low-carbon energy demonstration projects.
      The Commission manages the programme on behalf of the Member States, while the EIB is responsible
      for the asset management of the NER 300 Fund and acts as a technical advisor, under the Cooperation
      Agreement with the Commission. Since neither the revenues from the allowances nor the expenses for
      the projects financed are part of the EU budget, these amounts are not accounted for in the EU accounts.

appropriations


The above table shows the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) ceilings at current prices. 2017 was
the fourth financial year covered by the MFF 2014-2020. The overall ceiling for commitment
appropriations for 2017 was EUR 155 631 million, equivalent to 1.04 % of the EU GNI, whilst the
corresponding ceiling for payment appropriations was EUR 142 906 million, or 0.95 % of the EU GNI valid
throughout the budgetary year 2017.

New flexibility provisions have been agreed for the 2014-2020 MFF. One of the new provisions is a
possibility to transfer unspent margins under the payment ceilings to the following years – via the Global
Margin for Payments in the framework of the technical adjustment of the MFF for the following year.
Therefore, the unspent amount from 2015 (EUR 1 288 million in current prices) and 2016
(EUR 13 991 million in current prices) was transferred to the years 2018-2020 and the ceilings of 2015,
2016 and 2018-2020 were adjusted accordingly – see the above mentioned technical adjustment of the
MFF for 2017 and the technical adjustment for 2018 (COM(2017) 220 of 24 May 2017).

On 24 May 2017 the Commission adopted a Communication on technical adjustment of the financial
framework for 2018 in line with movements in GNI (ESA 2010) (COM(2017) 220 of 24 May 2017).
Following the entry into force Council Regulation 2017/1123 amending MFF Regulation 1311/2013 (OJ L
163, 24.6.2017) as a result of the mid-term review/revision, the figures included in the Communication
of 24 May 2017 in respect of the Emergency Aid Reserve and the Flexibility Instrument were updated and
replaced in the Communication of 15 September 2017 (COM(2017) 473 final). The adjustments of figures
in this Communication result directly from the amendment of the MFF Regulation by Regulation (EU,
Euratom) 2017/1123 and did not deviate from the provisions of Article 6(4) of the MFF Regulation,
according to which no further technical adjustments than those referred to in Article 6(1) are made either


                                                                                                                             125

      during the year or ex-post. The newly introduced technical adjustment for the Flexibility instrument
      according to Art 6(1)f is provided for the first time.

      An explanation of the various headings of the MFF is given below:

      Heading 1 – Smart and inclusive growth

      This heading is divided into two separate, but interlinked components:

      1a   Competitiveness for growth and jobs, encompassing expenditure on research and innovation,
           education and training, Connecting Europe Facility, social policy, the internal market and
           accompanying policies.

      1b   Economic, social and territorial cohesion, designed to enhance convergence of the least developed
           Member States and regions, to complement the EU strategy for sustainable development outside the
           less prosperous regions and to support inter regional cooperation.

      Heading 2 – Sustainable growth: natural resources

      Heading 2 includes the common agricultural and fisheries policies, and the environmental measures, in
      particular the Life + program.

      Heading 3 – Security and citizenship

      Heading 3 (Security and citizenship) reflects the growing importance attached to certain fields where the
      EU has been assigned particular tasks – justice and home affairs, border protection, immigration and
      asylum policy, public health and consumer protection, culture, youth, information and dialogue with
      citizens.

      Heading 4 – Global Europe

      Heading 4 covers all external action, including development cooperation, humanitarian aid, pre-accession
      and neighbourhood instruments. The EDF remains outside of the EU budget and is not part of the MFF.

      Heading 5 - Administration

      This heading covers administrative expenditure for all institutions, pensions and the European Schools.
      For the Institutions other than the Commission, these costs make up the total of their expenditure.

      Heading 6 - Compensations

      In accordance with the political agreement that new Member States should not become net-contributors
      to the budget at the very beginning of their membership, compensation was foreseen under this heading.
      This amount was available as transfers to them to balance their budgetary receipts and contributions.

      Heading 9 – Special instruments

      Flexibility mechanisms enable the EU to mobilise the necessary funds to react to unforeseen events such
      as crisis and emergency situations. Their scope, financial allocation and operating modalities are provided
      for in the MFF regulation and the Interinstitutional Agreement. In the current context of reduced
      expenditure, they also ensure that budgetary resources can respond to evolving priorities, so that every
      euro is used where it is most needed. Most of the flexibility mechanisms are therefore kept outside the
      MFF and the funding can be mobilised above the expenditure ceilings.


      1.2. MFF DETAILED HEADINGS (PROGRAMS)

      The headings of the MFF are further broken down into detailed headings, corresponding to the main
      spending programs (e.g. Horizon 2020, Erasmus+ etc.). Underlying legal bases for budget
      implementation are adopted at this program level. Programs are the commonly used structure for
      reporting on implementation and results. For this reason, tables by program have been introduced also in
      these budgetary implementation reports (see tables 4.6 - 4.10 below).

1.3. ANNUAL BUDGET

Every year, the Commission estimates all the Institutions' revenue and expenditure for the year and
draws up a draft budget which it sends to the budgetary authority. On the basis of this draft budget, the
Council sets out its position, which is then the subject of negotiations between the two arms of the
budgetary authority. The President of the EP declares that the joint draft has been finally adopted, thus
making the budget enforceable. During the year in question, amending budgets are adopted. The task of
executing the budget is mainly the responsibility of the Commission.

The budget structure for the Commission consists of administrative and operational appropriations. The
other Institutions have only administrative appropriations. Furthermore, the budget distinguishes
between two types of appropriations: non-differentiated and differentiated. Non-differentiated
appropriations are used to finance operations of an annual nature (which comply with the principle of
annuality). Differentiated appropriations are used in order to reconcile the principle of annuality with the
need to manage multiannual operations. Differentiated appropriations are split into commitment and
payment appropriations:

-     commitment appropriations: cover the total cost of the legal obligations entered into for the current
      financial year for operations extending over a number of years. However, budgetary commitments for
      actions extending over more than one financial year may be broken down over several years into
      annual instalments where the basic act so provides.

-     payment appropriations: cover expenditure arising from commitments entered into in the current
      financial year and/or earlier financial years.

In the accounts, the types of funding are grouped into two main items:

      •       Final adopted budget appropriations; and
      •       Additional appropriations containing:
          –     Carryovers from previous year (the financial regulation allows for a limited number of cases
                to carry unspent amounts from the previous year into the current year); and
          –     Assigned revenue arising from reimbursements, contributions from third parties/countries to
                EU programs and work performed for third parties are assigned directly to the corresponding
                expenditure budget lines and constitute the third pillar of funding.

All funding types together form the available appropriations.


1.4. REVENUE

1.4.1.        Own resources revenue

The vast majority of revenue comes from own resources, which consist of the following categories:

(1)       Traditional own resources (TOR): usually account for +/- 15 % of own resource revenue.

(2)       Value added tax (VAT) based resource: usually accounts for around 13 % of own resource
          revenue.

(3)       Gross national income (GNI) based resource: usually accounts for +/- 72 % of own resource
          revenue.

The allocation of own resources is made in accordance with the rules laid down in the Council Decision
No. 2014/335/EU, Euratom of 26 May 2014 on the system of the EU's own resources (ORD 2014). This
decision has entered into force on 1 October 2016 and applies retroactively from 1 January 2014. The
effects for 2014 and 2015 have been taken into account in the 2016 budgetary year.

The total amount of own resources allocated to the Union to cover annual appropriations for payments
shall not exceed 1.20 % of the sum of all the Member States' GNIs.




                                                                                                               127
-----------------------Page 129 End-----------------------

                                       Annual accounts of the European Union 2017

      1.4.2.    Traditional own resources (TOR)

      Traditional own resources (TOR) consist of customs duties (levied on imports from third countries) and
      sugar levies (paid by sugar producers to finance expenditure on the sugar common organisation of the
      market) levied on economic operators and collected by Member States on behalf of the EU. However,
      Member States keep 20 % as a compensation for their collection costs. All established traditional own
      resource amounts must be entered in one or other of the accounts kept by the competent authorities:

      -   In the ordinary accounts provided for in Article 6(3) of Regulation No 609/2014: all amounts
          recovered or guaranteed.
      -   In the separate accounts provided for also in the above Article: all amounts not yet recovered and/or
          not guaranteed; amounts guaranteed but challenged may also be entered in this account.

      Traditional own resources must be entered in the Commission's account with the treasury or national
      central bank by the Member State at the latest on the first working day following the 19th day of the
      second month following the month during which the entitlement was established (or recovered in the
      case of the separate account).


      1.4.3.    Value added tax (VAT)

      Value added tax (VAT) is levied on Member States' VAT bases, which are harmonised for this purpose in
      accordance with EU rules. However, the VAT base is capped at 50 % of each Member State’s GNI. The
      uniform VAT rate applied is fixed at 0.30 % except for the period 2014-2020 in which the rate of call for
      Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden was fixed at 0.15 %.


      1.4.4.    Gross national income (GNI)

      The resource based on gross national income (GNI) is used to finance the part of the budget not covered
      by any other sources of revenue. The same percentage rate is levied on each Member States' GNI, which
      is established in accordance with EU rules.

      VAT and GNI-based resources are determined on the basis of forecasts of relevant bases made when the
      draft budget is being prepared. These forecasts are subsequently revised and updated during the budget
      year in question by means of an amending budget. Differences between the amounts due by the Member
      States by reference to the actual bases and the sums actually paid on the basis of the (revised) forecasts,
      either positive or negative, are called by the Commission from the Member States for the first working
      day of June of the second year following the budget year in question. Corrections may still be made to the
      actual VAT and GNI bases during the subsequent four years, unless a reservation is issued. These
      reservations have to be seen as potential claims on the Member States for uncertain amounts as their
      financial impact cannot be estimated with accuracy. When the exact amount can be determined, the
      corresponding VAT and GNI-based resources are called either in connection with the VAT and GNI
      balances exercise or by individual calls for funds.


      1.4.5.    UK correction

      A budgetary imbalance correction mechanism in favour of the United Kingdom (reducing their own
      resource payments while increasing the payments of other Member States) was instituted by the
      European Council in Fontainebleau (June 1984). Germany, Austria, Sweden and Netherlands benefit from
      a reduced financing of the UK correction (restricted to one fourth of their normal share).


      1.4.6.    Gross reduction

      The European Council of 7-8 February 2013 concluded that Denmark, the Netherlands and Sweden
      should benefit from gross reductions in their annual contributions based on GNI for the period 2014-2020
      and that Austria is to benefit from gross reductions for the period 2014-2016 only. The annual reductions
      are as follows: Denmark EUR 130 million, the Netherlands EUR 695 million and Sweden EUR 185 million.

1.5. CALCULATION OF THE BUDGET RESULT

The budget result of the EU is returned to the Member States during the following year through deduction
of their amounts due for that year.

The amounts of own resources entered in the accounts are those credited during the course of the year
to the accounts opened in the Commission's name by the governments of the Member States. Revenue
comprises also, in the case of a surplus, the budget result for the previous financial year. The other
revenue entered in the accounts is the amount actually received during the course of the year.

For the purposes of calculating the budget result for the year, expenditure comprises payments made
against the year's appropriations plus any of the appropriations for that year that are carried over to the
following year. Payments made against the year's appropriations means payments that are made by the
Accounting Officer by 31 December of the financial year. For the EAGF, payments are those effected by
the Member States between 16 October N-1 and 15 October N, provided that the Accounting Officer was
notified of the commitment and authorisation by 31 January N+1. EAGF expenditure may be subject to a
conformity decision following controls in the Member States.

The budget result comprises two elements: the result of the EU and the result of the participation of the
EFTA countries belonging to the European Economic Area (EEA). In accordance with Article 1(1) of
Regulation No 608/2014 laying down implementing measures for the system of own resources, this result
represents the difference between:

-   total revenue received for the financial year; and

-   total payments made against current year's appropriations plus the total amount of that year's
    appropriations carried over to the following year.

The following are added to or deducted from the resulting figure:

-   the net balance of cancellations of payment appropriations carried over from previous years and any
    payments which, because of fluctuations in the euro rate, exceed non-differentiated appropriations
    carried over from the previous year;

-   the evolution of assigned revenue; and

-   the net exchange-rate gains or losses recorded during the year.

Appropriations carried over from the previous financial year in respect of contributions by and work for
third parties, which by definition never lapse, are included as additional appropriations for the financial
year. This explains the difference between carryovers from the previous year in the year N budget
implementation reports and those carried over to the following year in the year N-1 budget
implementation reports. Appropriations made available again following the repayment of payments on
account are disregarded when calculating the budget result.

Payment appropriations carried over include: automatic carryovers and carryovers by decision. The
cancellation of unused payment appropriations carried over from the previous year shows the
cancellations of appropriations carried over automatically and by decision.




                                                                                                              129

      In accordance with the Financial Regulation, the economic result of the year is calculated on the basis of
      accrual accounting principles, while the budget result is based on modified cash accounting rules. As the
      economic result and the budget result both cover the same underlying transactions, it is a useful control
      to ensure that they are reconcilable.

      Reconciling items - Revenue

      The actual budgetary revenue for a financial year corresponds to the revenue collected from entitlements
      established in the course of the year and amounts collected from entitlements established in previous
      years. Therefore the entitlements established in the current year but not yet collected are to be deducted
      from the economic result for reconciliation purposes as they do not form part of budgetary revenue. On
      the contrary the entitlements established in previous years and collected in current year must be added
      to the economic result for reconciliation purposes.

      The accrued revenue mainly consists of accrued revenue for agriculture, own resources, interests and
      dividends. Only the net-effect, i.e. accrued revenue for current year minus reversal accrued revenue from
      previous year, is taken into consideration.

      Reconciling items - Expenditure

      The accrued expenses mainly consists of accruals made for year-end cut-off purposes, i.e. eligible
      expenses incurred by beneficiaries of EU funds but not yet reported to the Commission. Only the net-
      effect, i.e. accrued expenses for current year minus reversal accrued expenses from previous year, is
      taken into consideration. Payments made in the current year relating to invoices registered in prior years
      are part of current year's budgetary expenditure and therefore must be added to the economic result for
      reconciliation purposes.

      The net effect of pre-financing is the combination of (1) the new pre-financing amounts paid in the
      current year and recognised as budgetary expenditure of the year and (2) the clearing of the pre-
      financing through eligible costs accepted during the current year. The latter represent an expense in
      accrual terms but not in the budgetary accounts since the payment of the initial pre-financing had
      already been considered as a budgetary expenditure at the time of its payment.

      As well as the payments made against the year's appropriations, the appropriations for that year that are
      carried forward to the next year also need to be taken into account in calculating the budget result for
      the year (in accordance with Article 1(1) of Regulation No 608/2014). The same applies for the budgetary

                                  Annual accounts of the European Union 2017

payments made in the current year from carry-overs from previous years, and the cancellation of unused
payment appropriations.

The movement in provisions relates to year-end estimates made in the financial statements (employee
benefits mainly) that do not impact the budgetary accounts. Other reconciling amounts comprise different
elements such as asset amortisation/depreciation, asset acquisitions, capital lease payments and financial
participations for which the budgetary and accrual accounting treatments differ.




2. IMPLEMENTATION OF THE 2017 EU BUDGET –
   COMMENTARY

2.1. REVENUE

In the initial adopted EU budget, signed by the President of the European Parliament on
1 December 2016, the amount of payment appropriations was EUR 134 490 million and the amount to be
financed by own resources totalled EUR 131 718 million. The revenue and expenditure estimates in the
initial budget are typically adjusted during the budgetary year, such modifications being presented in
amending budgets. Adjustments in the GNI-based own resources ensure that budgeted revenue matches
exactly budgeted expenditure. In accordance with the principle of equilibrium, budget revenue and
expenditure (payment appropriations) must be in balance.

During 2017, six amending budgets were adopted. Taking them into account, the final adopted revenue
for 2017 amounted to EUR 126 771 million. The surplus from the previous financial year, the substantial
reduction of payment appropriations, a significant collection of fines and other contributions reduced
Member States' GNI balancing contribution in 2017 (EUR 115 484 million).

As far as the own resources result is concerned, the collection of traditional own resources was very close
to the forecasted amounts. This is primarily because the budget estimates were modified at the time the
amending budget 6/2017 was established (according to the new forecasts of spring 2017).

The final Member States' VAT and GNI payments also correspond closely to the final budgetary estimate.
The differences between the forecasted amounts and the amounts actually paid are due to the differences
between the euro rates used for budgetary purposes and the rates in force at the time when the Member
States outside the EMU actually made their payments.

As far as the VAT and GNI balances are concerned there is a new procedure in place. The rules are set
out in Article 10 b of the Making Available Regulation (Regulation 609/2014). The new procedure does
not entail an amending budget and therefore the Commission directly requests the Member States to pay
the net amounts. The impact for the EU budget was close to zero due to the new netting system.

The heading "Contributions and refunds in connection with EU agreements and programmes" concerns
mainly revenue from financial corrections (ESIF, EAGF and EAFRD), the participation of third countries in
research programs and other contributions and refunds to EU programs/activities. A substantial part of
this total is made up of earmarked revenue, which typically gives rise to the entering of additional
appropriations on the expenditure side. In 2017, these contributions and refunds mainly originated from
repayments for structural funds (EUR 6.7 billion), the clearance of accounts in agricultural funds
(EUR 1.9 billion), the contribution of member states or third parties to specific agreements
(EUR 1.6 billion) and contributions to EU programs (EUR 1 billion).

The revenue from fines relates mainly to fines in the field of competition.


2.2. EXPENDITURE

The 2017 budget aimed to achieve the right balance between the implementation of ongoing
programmes and addressing newer challenges. It therefore built on commitments made in previous
years, and makes use of the existing room for flexibility to respond to challenges in line with the 2014-
2020 Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF).

                                       Annual accounts of the European Union 2017

      In line with the annual evolution foreseen in the MFF, appropriations proposed in the draft budget were
      set at EUR 157.7 billion (1.7 % higher when compared to the 2016 budget) in commitments, and
      EUR 134.9 billion (– 6.2 %) in payments, corresponding to 1.05 % and 0.90 % of EU GNI, respectively.
      The increase in commitment appropriations was 4.8 % after ‘neutralising’ the impact of the re-
      programming of the 2014 annual tranche of the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development, the
      Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund, and the Internal Security Fund. The significant reduction of total
      payments essentially reflects the finalisation of the implementation of programmes from the 2007-2013
      MFF and the slow implementation of the new generation of programmes in some policy areas.

      During the year, commitment appropriations were increased by EUR 500 million through amending
      budget 3/2017 for the Youth Employment Initiative (YEI) and amending budget 5/2017 to endow the
      EFSD Guarantee Fund with an initial allocation of EUR 275 million.

      Following the difficult situation of 2016, a year in which payment appropriations exceeded the needs and
      the year was closed with a large surplus, the Commission at first observed equally slow progression in
      the applications for payments in 2017 and acted to adjust the budget accordingly. Therefore, draft
      amending budget 6/2017 was presented on 9 October 2017 proposing to decrease the level of payment
      appropriations by EUR 7.7 billion, out of which EUR 5.9 billion from budget lines under sub-heading 1b
      Economic, social and territorial cohesion and to a lesser extent from headings 2 Sustainable Growth:
      Natural Resources, 3 Security and Citizenship, and 4 Global Europe, as well as from the European Union
      Solidarity Fund (EUSF).
      2017 Implementation of available appropriations
      The 2017 implementation for all types of appropriations (budget, carry-overs from 2017 and assigned
      revenue) was 97 % for commitments and 93.9 % for payments. Appropriations from the budget were
      fully implemented in 2017 (98.35 % in payments), a good achievement given the uncertainties which
      prevailed in 2016 and most of 2017. The implementation rate rises to 99.9 % of commitment
      appropriations and 99.8 % of payment appropriations when assuming full consumption of the amounts
      carried over to 2018.

      For the sub-heading 1b Economic, social and territorial cohesion, the financial implementation of 2014-
      2020 programmes progressed significantly compared to 2016, while the first closure payments were
      made for the 2007-2013 programmes. The reduction of payment appropriations through amending
      budget 6/2017 was fully offset by the use of assigned revenue from the clearance of accounts procedure
      and the final amount spent for payments nearly equalled the budget initially foreseen.

      In heading 2 Sustainable Growth: Natural Resources, the financial implementation of the new EAFRD
      programmes also increased compared to 2016.
      Outstanding Commitments
      Outstanding commitments (RAL, committed amounts not yet paid for) stood at EUR 267 billion at the end
      of 2017. The increase of over EUR 28 billion in comparison with the end of 2016 is larger than expected,
      since the gap between commitments and payments made was wider than initially foreseen due to the
      reduction of payments in amending budget 6/2017. However an increase in RAL constitutes a normal
      evolution, as commitment appropriations increase every year as foreseen in the Multiannual Financial
      Framework. In 2018, a further increase of RAL is expected as a result of the difference between budgeted
      commitment and payment appropriations. However, this increase should be significantly lower than in
      2017 given the smaller gap between commitment and payment appropriations in the adopted 2018
      budget. Moreover, payment claims in the area of heading 1b Economic, social and territorial cohesion are
      expected to increase due to the application of the automatic "n+3" de-commitment rule.

      A more detailed analysis of budgetary adjustments, their relevant context, justification and impact is
      presented in the Commission's report on Budgetary and Financial Management 2017, Part A "Overview at
      budget level" and Part B dealing with each heading of the Multiannual Financial Framework.

      Budget result
      The budget result of 2017 was a historically low EUR 0.56 billion and arises primarily from the revenue
      side, where revenues from contributions and refunds were material in 2017 (EUR 12.2 billion), originating
      from repayments for structural funds (EUR 6.7 billion), the clearance of accounts in agricultural funds
      (EUR 1.9 billion), the contribution of member states or third parties to specific agreements
      (EUR 1.6 billion) and contributions to EU programs (EUR 1 billion). Payment appropriations reached full
      implementation (98.35 %), unspent amounts were allowed for carry-over to 2018 and the amount not
      used is insignificant.

      The consolidated reports on the implementation of the general budget of the EU include, as in previous years, the budget implementation of all Institutions
      since within the EU budget a separate budget for each Institution is established. Agencies do not have a separate budget inside the EU budget and they are
      partially financed by a Commission budget subsidy.

      Concerning the EEAS, it should be noted that, in addition to its own budget, it also receives contributions from the Commission of EUR 144 million (2016:
      EUR 140 million) and the EDF of EUR 72 million (2016: EUR 44 million). These budget credits are put at the disposal of the EEAS (as assigned revenue) so as to
      cover primarily the costs of Commission staff working in the EU delegations, these delegations being administratively managed by the EEAS.

      GLOSSARY

      Actuarial assumptions

      Assumptions used to calculate the costs of future events that affect the pension liability.

      Actuarial gains and losses

      For a defined benefit scheme, the changes in actuarial deficits or surpluses. They arise as a result of
      differences between the previous actuarial assumptions and what has actually occurred and due to effects
      of changes in actuarial assumptions.

      Administrative appropriations

      Administrative appropriations cover the running costs of the Institutions and entities (staff, buildings,
      office equipment).

      Adopted budget

      Draft budget becomes the adopted budget as soon as it is approved by the Budgetary Authority.

      Amending budget

      Decision adopted during the budget year to amend (increase, decrease, transfer) aspects of the adopted
      budget of that year.

      Amounts to be called from Member States

      These represent expenses incurred during the reporting period that will need to be funded by future
      budgets, i.e. by the EU Member States. This is a consequence of the co-existence of accruals based
      financial statements and a cash based budget.

      Annual Activity Report (AAR)

      Annual Activity Reports indicate the results of operations by reference to objectives set, associated risks
      and the form of internal control, inter alia. Since the 2001 budget exercise for the Commission and since
      2003 for all European Union (EU) institutions, the ‘authorising officer by delegation’ must submit an AAR
      to his/her institution on the performance of his/her duties, together with financial and management
      information.

      Appropriations

      Budget funding. The budget forecasts both commitments and payments (cash or bank transfers to the
      beneficiaries). Appropriations for commitments and payments often differ (differentiated appropriations)
      because multi annual programmes and projects are usually fully committed in the year they are decided
      and are paid over the years as the implementation of the programme and project progresses. Non-
      differentiated appropriations apply to administrative expenditure, for agricultural market support and
      direct payments and commitment appropriations equal payment appropriations.

      Assigned revenue

      Dedicated revenue received to finance specific items of expenditure. The main source of external
      assigned revenue is financial contributions from third countries to programmes financed by the Union.
      The main source of internal assigned revenue is revenue from third parties in respect of goods, services
      or work supplied at their request; revenue arising from the repayment of amounts wrongly paid and
      revenue from the sale of publications and films, including those on an electronic medium.

                                      Annual accounts of the European Union 2017

Available for sale financial assets

All financial assets (except derivatives) that are according to International Public Sector Accounting
Standards measured at fair value and for which the changes in fair value are to be recognised in a
reserve in net assets until derecognition (or impairment).

Budget line

As far as the budget structure is concerned, revenue and expenditure are shown in the budget in
accordance with a binding nomenclature which reflects the nature and purpose of each item, as imposed
by the budgetary authority. The individual headings (title, chapter, article or line) provide a formal
description of the nomenclature.

Cancellation of appropriations

Unused appropriations that may no longer be used.

Carryover of appropriations

Exception to the principle of annuality in so far as appropriations that could not be used in a given budget
year may, under strict conditions, be exceptionally carried over for use during the following year.

Commitment

Legal pledge to provide finance subject to certain conditions. The EU commits itself to reimbursing its
share of the costs of an EU funded project. Today’s commitments are tomorrow’s payments. Today’s
payments are yesterday’s commitments.

Commitment appropriation

Commitment appropriations cover the total cost of legal obligations                      (contracts,   grant
agreements/decisions) that could be signed in the current financial year.

Current service cost

The increase in scheme liabilities arising from service in the current financial year.

Decommitment

An act whereby a previous commitment (or part of it) is cancelled.

Defined benefit scheme

A pension or other retirement benefit scheme where the scheme rules define the benefits independently
of the contributions payable, and the benefits are not directly related to the investments of the scheme.
The scheme may be funded or unfunded.

Derivatives

Financial instruments whose value is linked to changes in the value of another financial instrument, an
indicator or a commodity. In contrast to the holder of a primary financial instrument (e.g. a government
bond), who has an unqualified right to receive cash (or some other economic benefit) in the future, the
holder of a derivative has only a qualified right to receive such a benefit. An example of a derivative is
currency forward contract.

Direct management

Mode of budget implementation. Under direct management the budget is implemented directly by
Commission services, Executive Agencies or Trust Funds.

Discount rate

The rate used to adjust for the time value of money. Discounting is a technique used to compare costs
and benefits that occur in different time periods.

                                                        163                                                    163

                                          Annual accounts of the European Union 2017

      Effective interest rate

      The rate that discounts estimated future cash receipts or payments over the expected life of the financial
      asset or financial liability to the net carrying amount of the asset or liability.

      Financial assets or liabilities at fair value through surplus or deficit

      All financial assets or liabilities that are according to International Public Sector Accounting Standards
      measured at fair value and for which the changes in fair value are to be recognised in surplus or deficit of
      the period (i.e. derivatives).

      Financial correction

      The purpose of financial corrections is to protect the EU budget from the burden of erroneous or irregular
      expenditure. For expenditure under shared management, the task of recovering incorrectly made
      payments is primarily the responsibility of the Member State.

      A 'confirmed' financial correction has been accepted by the Member State concerned. A 'decided' financial
      correction has been adopted by a Commission decision and is always a net correction, where the Member
      State is required to reimburse irregular funds to the EU budget, thus leading to a definitive reduction of
      the allocated envelope to the Member State concerned. Confirmed and decided financial corrections are
      reported in this publication as one category.

      An 'implemented' financial correction has corrected the observed irregularity.

      Indirect management

      Mode of budget implementation. Under indirect management the Commission confers tasks of budget
      implementation to bodies of EU law or national law.

      Interruptions and suspensions

      If the Commission finds, based on its own work or the information reported by audit authorities, that a
      Member State has failed to remedy serious shortcomings in the management and control systems and/or
      to correct irregular expenditure which had been declared and certified, it may interrupt or suspend
      payments.

      Irregularity

      An irregularity is an act which does not comply with EU rules and which has a potentially negative impact
      on EU financial interests, but which may be the result of genuine errors committed either by beneficiaries
      claiming funds or by the authorities responsible for making payments. If an irregularity is committed
      deliberately, it constitutes fraud.

      Lapsing appropriations

      Unused appropriations to be cancelled at the end of the financial year. Lapsing means the cancellation of
      all or part of the authorisation to make expenditures and/or incur liabilities which is represented by an
      appropriation. Only for Joint Undertakings, as specified in theirs Financial Rules, any unused
      appropriations may be entered in the estimate of revenue and expenditure of up to the following three
      financial years (the so-called "N+3" rule). Hence, lapsing appropriations for JUs could be reactivated until
      financial year "N+3"

      Own resources

      Represent the main funding for the EU institutions and bodies and are defined in the own resources
      regulation 609/2014. Own resources comprise GNI-based resources, VAT-based resources and traditional
      own resources.

      Payment appropriations

      Payment appropriations cover expenditure due in the current year, arising from legal commitments
      entered in the current year and/or earlier years.

Pre-financing

A payment intended to provide the beneficiary with a float. It may be split into a number of payments in
accordance with the provisions of the underlying contract, decision, agreement or the basic legal act. The
float or advance is either used for the purpose for which it was provided during the period defined in the
agreement or it is repaid.

Preventive measure

Preventive measures, which are at the Commission’s disposal to protect the EU budget when it is aware
of potential deficiencies, include suspensions and interruptions of payments from the EU budget to the
operational programme.

Reste à Liquider (RAL)

Represents the amount where a budgetary commitment has been made but the subsequent payment is
not yet done. They represent payment obligations for the EU for future years and stem directly from the
existence of multi annual programmes and the dissociation between commitment and payment
appropriations.

Shared management

Mode of budget implementation. Under shared management budget implementation tasks are delegated
to Member States. About 80 % of the EU expenditure falls under this implementation mode.

Traditional own resources

These represent revenue for the EU and are part of the 'own resources' which fund the activities of the
EU. Traditional own resources are defined in the own resource regulation 609/2014 and comprise
customs duties and sugar levies.

Transfers (between budget lines)

Transfers between budget lines imply the relocation of appropriations from one budget line to another, in
the course of the financial year, and thereby they constitute an exception to the budgetary principle of
specification. They are, however, expressly authorised by the Treaty on the Functioning of the European
Union under the conditions laid down in the Financial Regulation (FR). The FR identifies different types of
transfers depending on whether they are between or within budget titles, chapters, articles or headings
and require different levels of authorisation.
