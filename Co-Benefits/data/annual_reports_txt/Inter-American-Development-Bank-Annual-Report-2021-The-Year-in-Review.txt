Message from
the President

In 2021, Latin America and the Caribbean continued to
face the pandemic head-on, with more than 1.5 million
deaths and increasing economic challenges. However,
the IDB demonstrated its capacity to deploy its excep-
tional human capital to respond to our client’s immediate
needs while designing recovery plans and charting a
new path toward growth.
    By expediting project preparation, we were able to
provide an unprecedented package of $23.3 billion in
investments, loans, commitments, mobilization and
technical assistance. This included $14 billion in loans
from the IDB. IDB Invest also had a record year with
$6.3 billion in financial commitments and $3 billion in core mobilizations.
    This financing represents the highest annual total in our history. Our operations
enabled the purchase of life-saving vaccines and direct assistance to people and
companies impacted by the pandemic, while also helping countries to invest in
priorities ranging from digitalization to climate change action, supply chains and
education. Our financing is helping to reduce gender inequality, expand entrepre-
neurial ecosystems, and provide credit to the small and midsize companies that
account for over two-thirds of the region’s jobs.
    In all, the IDB approved 94 projects in 2021, while disbursing $12.5 billion for
existing operations. Our public-sector operations are accelerating digitalization to
improve public services, expanding digital-skills training, increasing transparency
and combating corruption, among many other areas.
    Amid a historic reconfiguration of international trade, the IDB approved $2.3 bil-
lion to strengthen regional supply chains, nearly doubling the average amount of the
three years before the pandemic. The Bank also worked with 16 countries to identify
critical export and supply-chain advantages, including in Costa Rica’s semiconduc-
tor sector and the textile sector in Central American countries.
    In 2021, the IDB launched its Amazon Unit and approved $4.5 billion in resources
for climate-related operations, the highest amount ever. The Bank also took a lead-
ing role among multilateral development banks at COP26, the annual United Nations
conference on climate change, announcing a plan to fully align operations with the




                                                                       IDB ANNUAL REPORT 2021   1

Paris Agreement, and provide $24 billion for climate and green finance over the next
four years.
    Among projects approved in 2021, nearly 70 percent included one or more com-
ponents to tackle climate change, while 75 percent addressed gender issues. Almost
40 percent of approvals went to small and vulnerable countries.
    In 2021, the IDB dramatically scaled up its engagement with the private sector
by launching the Private Sector Partners Coalition. This initiative quickly grew from
40 to 160 leading companies that are now participating in 13 working groups to
tackle areas such as nearshoring, climate change, women’s empowerment and dig-
ital transformation.
    In addition to the record commitments and mobilization described above, in
2021, IDB Invest mobilized $0.95 for every dollar closed on its own account in long-
term financing, an almost 50 percent increase over the previous year.
    IDB Invest’s financial commitments surpassed sectoral targets, with about
50 percent going toward gender, diversity and inclusion projects, 53 percent targeting
climate change and nearly 37 percent supporting small and midsize companies. IDB
Invest also increased its focus on digitalization and regional integration projects, which
accounted for 18 percent and 25 percent of financial commitments, respectively. In
addition, IDB Invest spearheaded innovative equity investments in the digital space,
including in ProducePay, Recarga Pay, Kubo and Merqueo.
    IDB Lab approved 122 operations in 2021 for a total of $102.8 million, with almost
60 percent earmarked for small and vulnerable countries and a similar proportion
for projects addressing gender gaps.
    These exceptional results were made possible by the creativity and dedication
of the IDB Group’s employees, and by a comprehensive effort to improve efficiency
across every aspect of our operations. Among other measures, the IDB piloted a
streamlined process for projects that slashed approval times by 30 percent, enabling
the Bank to quickly meet the needs of its 26 regional member countries.
    In our region, discussions are happening about how to envision a post-pandemic
recovery. Innovation, investment, and inclusion are going to be key to ensuring
sustainable development, growth and prosperity. They are exploring new ways
of educating their children, growing their businesses, improving healthcare, and
decarbonizing the economy—among many other issues. In virtually every industry
and service sector, path-breaking leaders are seeking to increase opportunity and
improve quality of life for all.
    In 2022, the IDB Group will continue to be the strategic partner of choice for
countries and companies that are eager to seize these opportunities.

Executive Directors

The IDB’s shareholders—its 48 member countries—are represented by the Board of
Governors, the highest decision-making body of the Bank. The Governors delegate
many of their powers to the Board of Executive Directors, whose 14 members they elect
or appoint for three-year terms. Executive Directors for the United States and Can-
ada represent their own countries; all others represent groups of countries. The Board
of Executive Directors also includes 14 Alternates, who have full power to act when
their principals are absent. The Board of Executive Directors is responsible for day-to-
day oversight of the Bank’s operations. It establishes the institution’s policies, approves
projects, sets interest rates for Bank loans, authorizes borrowings in capital markets,
and approves the institution’s administrative budget. The work of the Board of Execu-
tive Directors is guided by the Regulations of the Board of Executive Directors and the
Code of Ethics for Executive Directors. The agendas and minutes of the meetings of the
Board of Executive Directors and its standing committees are public documents.

Operational
Summary                                                                                  1
Loan Approvals and Active Portfolio of Sovereign Guaranteed
Projects

In 2021, the Inter-American Development Bank approved 94 sovereign guaranteed
loan operations with total financing of $13.6 billion. This lending program included
71  investment projects for $6.7 billion, 20 policy-based loan (PBL) projects for
$5.7  billion, one hybrid project for $400 million and two special development
lending projects for $750 million.
    Investment projects included 19 operations for $2.4 billion under conditional
credit lines for investment projects (CCLIPs).
    The 20 PBL projects include one multiple-tranche operation for $500 million,
18 programmatic policy-based loans for $4.8 billion and one policy-based guaran-
tee for $400 million. Of the 18 programmatic policy-based loans, 9 operations for
$2.9 billion correspond to the first stage and the rest to subsequent stages.
    Since 2018, the amount of sovereign guaranteed approvals has been rising
steadily. The average annual approved value in the last five years was $12.5 billion,
22 percent more than the preceding five-year period.
    The program of sovereign guaranteed loan approvals anchors the financing of
projects with a total cost $15.5 billion, including $13.1 billion from the Ordinary Capital1,
$281 million from the IDB Grant Facility, $260 million from Bank-administered funds,
$1.3 billion from local contributions and $533 million in co-financing.
    Additionally, in 2021 the Bank approved six new CCLIPs for a total of $4.3 billion,
along with three new contingent credit facilities for natural disasters and public
health emergencies (CCFs) for $1.2 billion in El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala.
    Approvals for C and D countries reached $5.4 billion in 2021. These operations
represent 40 percent of all approvals in 2021, a level that is 5 percentage points
above the target established in the Corporate Results Framework (CRF) and 23
percent above the average amount for 2016–2019.

BOX 1
IDB support to the region during the COVID Crisis
In 2021 the IDB Group continued to help the region to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and
recover from its effects.
    The Bank supported 10 countries in the region to finance the procurement of COVID-19 vaccines
through the COVAX Facility, along with the investments necessary to implement vaccine deployment
plans. Guarantees and new loans were approved for Belize, Ecuador, Honduras, Panama and the
Dominican Republic, and resources were mobilized from the existing portfolio to Argentina, Belize,
Bahamas, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guyana, Honduras and Trinidad and Tobago. The Bank also worked with
countries and manufacturers to resolve compensation obligations derived from the contracts signed
with the pharmaceutical companies through guarantees.
    A proactive programming effort and continuous dialogue with our member governments enabled the
Bank to approve 34 sovereign guaranteed operations for $8.2 billion in new resources to respond to the
pandemic. In all, $6.6 billion (81 percent) of the volume of operations corresponded to rapid-disbursing
resources, in a reflection of the strong demand for liquid resources. Of the new approvals, 13 projects in
2021 (for a total of $1.8 billion) were structured as prototypes to respond to the pandemic emergency
in four priority areas: immediate response to the public-health emergency; safety nets for vulnerable
populations; economic productivity and employment; and fiscal policies to cushion economic impacts.
    Along with new approvals, the Board of Executive Directors authorized the reformulations of three
projects in the Bank’s portfolio to redirect a total of $92 million in additional resources to the emergency.
Including these reformulations, along with the use of one contingent lending facility, the Bank approved
a total $8.3 billion in financing in response to the pandemic, of which 52 percent was directed to C and D
countries. IDB Invest and IDB Lab also made important contributions to COVID-19 response efforts in areas
such as MSME financing, tourism, manufacturing, and agribusiness.
    In all, during 2020 and 2021 the Bank approved sovereign guaranteed operations totaling $26.3a bil-
lion while disbursing $25 billion for pandemic-related support to the region.
    This historic response was made possible by strategic decisions including:

•	      a willingness to simultaneously enable reformulations of existing operations and approvals of new
        resources;
•	      the approval of exceptional measures such as the temporary increase in the PBL limit and the
        suspensions of safeguards on investment projects;
•	      the use of contingent products such as CCFs which increased countries’ ability to access resources
        without the need for additional approvals by national legislative authorities;
•	      the adoption of project prototypes and accelerated procedures to speed up project preparation; and
•	      the provision of fiduciary support to governments for purchasing specialized supplies and reducing
        procurement risks.

Institutions for Development Sector (IFD)

In 2021, IFD focused on promoting institutional development in strategic areas for
economic and social recovery and ensuring the continuity of public services and
SMEs during the pandemic. IFD projects supported institutional capacity and the
rule of law to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of government services,
foster transparency, integrity, citizen security and justice, improve the business envi-
ronment, and accelerate digital transformation and environmental sustainability in
both the private and public sectors.
    In the area of fiscal management, the Bank supported policy reforms in Costa
Rica, Chile, Ecuador, Jamaica, Peru and Uruguay that enabled the implementation
of countercyclical fiscal policies along with improvements in the quality of pub-
lic spending and the efficiency of budgeting processes. Costa Rica and Ecuador
received budget support loans to meet short-term financing needs and protect
social policies for the most vulnerable populations.
    In terms of innovation for citizen services, the IDB advanced projects to
strengthen the institutional capacity of the state and the rule of law. The large-
scale project Brasil Mais Digital will accelerate digitization, strengthen management
capacities, and improve connectivity in states and municipalities. In Colombia, the
IDB is supporting the digital transformation of the justice system. In Paraguay and
Chile, projects are improving access to information and financial supervision of
public funds. The Mapainversiones initiative is helping to monitor COVID19-related
expenses. In 2021 the Bank also launched a study to foster digital talent in govern-
ment and a network to support cybersecurity in the region.
    To strengthen competitiveness, technology, and innovation, the IDB is imple-
menting projects to accelerate private sector innovation and address climate
change. In Argentina, Uruguay and Peru, operations are promoting the digitization
of environmentally sustainable SMEs. In The Bahamas, the Bank is supporting pol-
icies to improve the business climate and foster the blue economy as an engine of
sustainable productive diversification. In Brazil, the IDB is promoting the use of new
financial instruments to fund innovative companies in São Paulo state.
    In the area of connectivity, markets and finance, the Bank focused on reac-
tivating the productive sector by helping to mobilize financing for SMEs through
