EUROPEAN UNION POLITICAL AND
FINANCIAL FRAMEWORK, GOVERNANCE
AND ACCOUNTABILITY
The European Union (EU) is a Union on which the Member States confer competences to attain objectives
they have in common. The Union is founded on the values of respect for human dignity, freedom,
democracy, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights, including the rights of persons
belonging to minorities. These values are common to the Member States in a society in which pluralism,
non-discrimination, tolerance, justice, solidarity and equality between women and men prevail.


1.          POLITICAL AND FINANCIAL FRAMEWORK
                             The overarching objectives and principles that guide the Union and the
                             European institutions are defined in the Treaties. The Union and the EU
       EU Treaties
                             institutions may only act within the limits of the competences conferred by
                             the Treaties so as to attain the objectives set out therein and must do this in
accordance with the principles 1 of subsidiarity and proportionality. To attain its objectives and carry out
its policies, the Union provides itself with the necessary financial means. The Commission is responsible
for promoting the general interest of the Union which includes executing the budget and managing
programmes in cooperation with the Member States and in accordance with the principle of sound
financial management.

The EU pursues the objectives established by the Treaty with a number of tools, one of which is the EU
budget. Others are, for example, a common legislative framework or joint policy strategies.

                                 The political priorities of the Commission are defined in the political
    Commission political         guidelines set by the President of the Commission. Under President von der
        priorities               Leyen, the Commission which took office on 1 December 2019 will focus on
                                 the following six headline ambitions:

6 HEADLINE AMBITIONS

                  A European Green Deal
                  – Striving to be the first climate-neutral continent

                  An economy that works for people
                  – Working for social fairness and prosperity

                  A Europe fit for the digital age
                  – Empowering people with a new generation of technologies

                  Promoting our European way of life
                  – Building a Union of equality in which we all have the same access to opportunities

                  A stronger Europe in the world
                  – Europe to strive for more by strengthening our unique brand of responsible global
                    leadership
                  A new push for European democracy
                  – Nurturing, protecting and strengthening our democracy




1
     Under the principle of subsidiarity, the Union shall act only if and in so far as the objectives of the proposed action
     cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States but can rather, by reason of the scale or effects, be better
     achieved at Union level. Under the principle of proportionality, the content and form of Union action shall not
     exceed what is necessary to achieve the objectives of the Treaties (see Article 5 TEU).

                                  Annual accounts of the European Union 2019

The previous Commission focused on ten priorities set by former President Jean-Claude Juncker and in
line with Europe 2020, the EU’s long-term growth strategy at the time:

    •   A new boost for jobs, growth and                       •   A balanced and progressive trade policy
        investment;                                                to harness globalisation;
    •   A connected digital single market;                     •   An area of justice and fundamental
    •   A resilient Energy Union with a forward-                   rights based on mutual trust;
        looking climate change policy;                         •   Towards a new policy on migration;
    •   A deeper and fairer internal market with               •   Europe as a stronger global actor;
        a strengthened industrial base;                        •   A Union of democratic change.
    •   A deeper and fairer Economic and
        Monetary Union (EMU);

                            The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its 17 Sustainable
    2030 Agenda for
                            Development Goals, adopted by the United Nations in September 2015, have
      Sustainable
                            given a new impetus to global efforts to achieve sustainable development.
     Development
                            The EU played an important role in shaping the 2030 Agenda, reflecting the
fact that sustainable development has long been at the heart of the European project. The Sustainable
Development Goals are firmly anchored in the EU Treaties and mainstreamed in all the EU policies and
initiatives. The EU budget plays an essential role in addressing many sustainability challenges including
poverty, youth unemployment, health and well-being, climate change, loss of biodiversity, sustainable
energy and migration.

                           The policies supported by the EU budget are implemented in accordance with
 Multiannual financial
                           the multiannual financial framework (MFF) and corresponding sectoral
   framework and
                           legislation defining spending programmes. These translate the EU’s political
spending programmes
                           priorities into financial terms over a period long enough to be effective and
to provide a coherent long-term perspective for beneficiaries of EU funds and co-financing national
authorities. Maximum annual amounts (ceilings) are set for EU expenditure as a whole and for the main
categories of expenditure (headings). The sum of the ceilings of all headings gives the total ceiling for
commitment appropriations. The multiannual financial framework is adopted by unanimity indicating the
agreement of all Member States to the objectives and the level of spending (maximum level of budget
commitments and payments), with the consent of the European Parliament. The current MFF covers the
period 2014-2020.

                            The    multiannual     financial framework    is    complemented   by    the
    Interinstitutional      interinstitutional agreement 2, which is a political agreement between the
       agreement            European Parliament, the Council and the Commission. The purpose of this
                            agreement, adopted in 2013 in accordance with Article 295 of the Treaty on
the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), is to implement budgetary discipline, to improve the
functioning of the annual budgetary procedure and cooperation between the institutions on budgetary
matters, as well as to ensure sound financial management.

                             The annual budget is prepared by the Commission and usually agreed by
                             mid-December by the European Parliament and the Council, based on the
    Annual budget
                             procedure of Article 314 TFEU. According to the principle of budgetary
                             equilibrium, total revenue must equal total expenditure (payment
appropriations) for a given financial year.

The main sources of funding of the EU are own resources revenues which are complemented by other
revenues. There are three types of own resources: traditional own resources (such as custom duties and
sugar levies), the own resource based on value added tax (VAT) and the own resource based on gross
national income (GNI). Other revenues arising from the activities of the EU (e.g. competition fines)
normally represent less than 10 % of total revenue. The overall amount of own resources needed to
finance the budget is determined by total expenditure less other revenue. In the current MFF the total
amount of own resources cannot exceed 1.20 % of the sum of gross national income (GNI) of the
Member States.

    Commission on budgetary discipline, on cooperation in budgetary matters and on sound financial management

      •   Shared management: the vast proportion of the budget is managed under a system of shared
          management by the Commission in cooperation with the Member States, notably in the areas of
          structural funds and agriculture.

      •   Direct management: the Commission also manages programmes itself and can delegate the
          implementation of specific programmes to executive agencies.

      •   Indirect management: Expenditure decisions can also be indirectly managed via other bodies
          within or outside the EU. The Financial Regulation and/or delegation agreements define the
          necessary control and reporting mechanisms by these entities and the supervision by the
          Commission where budget implementation tasks are entrusted to national agencies, the European
          Investment Bank Group, third countries, international organisations (e.g. the World Bank or the
          United Nations) and other entities (e.g. EU decentralised agencies, Joint Undertakings).

                               The Financial Regulation (FR) 3 applicable to the general budget is a central
                               act in the regulatory architecture of the EU´s finances. It defines in detail the
    Financial Regulation
                               financial rules applicable to the execution of the EU budget and the roles of
                               the different actors involved in ensuring that the money is used soundly and
achieves the objectives set.




2.          GOVERNANCE AND ACCOUNTABILITY

2.1.        INSTITUTIONAL STRUCTURE

The EU has an institutional framework which aims to promote its values, advance its objectives, serve its
interests, those of its citizens and those of the Member States, and ensure the consistency, effectiveness
and continuity of its policies and actions. The organisational structure consists of institutions, agencies
and other EU bodies, which are included in the EU consolidated accounts as far as the consolidation
criteria as set out in the Financial Regulation and the applicable accounting rules are met (please refer to
note 9 for the list of entities included in the scope of consolidation).

The European Parliament, jointly with the Council, exercises legislative and budgetary functions. The
Commission is politically accountable to the European Parliament. The Council also carries out policy-
making and coordinating functions within the general political direction and priorities of the Union set by
the European Council.

The Commission is responsible for planning, preparing and proposing legislation; for managing EU
policies, including the monitoring of implementation of EU legislation and ensuring its enforcement; for
allocating EU funding and managing financing programmes; and for representing the EU internationally.

The Commission implements the budget, in large part in cooperation with the Member States 4. Together,
they ensure that the appropriations are used in accordance with the principles of sound financial
management. Regulations lay down the control and audit obligations of the Member States when they
share the implementation of the budget and the resulting responsibilities. They also lay down the
responsibilities and detailed rules for each of the EU’s institution as concerns their own expenditure.

2.2.        THE COMMISSION'S GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE

The Commission has a unique governance system, with a clear distinction between political and
administrative oversight structures and well-defined lines of responsibility and financial accountability 5.

The Commission's internal functioning is based on a number of key principles underpinning good
governance: clear roles and responsibilities, a strong commitment to performance management and
compliance with the legal framework, clear accountability mechanisms, a high quality and inclusive
regulatory framework, openness and transparency, and high standards of ethical behaviour.

The Commission performs its functions under the leadership of the College of Commissioners, which sets
priorities and takes overall political responsibility for the work of the Commission. The President decides
on the internal organisation of the Commission, ensuring that it acts consistently, efficiently and as a
collegiate body. The internal arrangements create a structure of robust controls and management tools
which allow the College of Commissioners to take political responsibility for the work of the Commission,
namely the decisions it takes as well as for coordinating, executive and management functions, as laid
down in the Treaties.

The College delegates the operational implementation of the budget and finanical management to the
Directors-General and Heads of Service who lead the administrative structure of the Commission 6. This
decentralised approach creates an administrative culture that encourages civil servants to take
responsibility for activities over which they have control and requires them to provide assurance as
concerns the activities for which they are accountable.

The central services support the Directors-General and Heads of Service in the exercise of their
responsibilities. In particular, the Corporate Management Board provides coordination, oversight, advice
and strategic orientations on corporate management issues, in areas including the management of
financial and human resources, risk management, performance management, IT governance, cyber- and
physical security, business continuity, communication and information management. 7

This governance system is based on the Treaties and has evolved over time to adapt to a changing
environment and to remain in line with best practice as set out in relevant international standards 8. The
further streamlining and strengthening of the arrangements introduced in 2018 9 took into account audit
work by the European Court of Auditors 10 and the Commission’s Internal Audit Service. As required by
the Financial Regulation (Article 247), the Annual Management and Performance Report for the EU
budget includes information on the key governance arrangements in the Commission.


2.3.        PERFORMANCE FRAMEWORK OF THE EU BUDGET

Implementing robust performance frameworks is essential for ensuring a strong focus on results,
European level added value and the sound management of EU programmes. The performance framework
for the EU budget is highly developed, and ranks higher than that of any individual country assessed by
the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) in its standard index of
performance budgeting frameworks.

The EU budget performance framework reports on several types and levels of strategic goals, objectives
and indicators. It also takes account of the complementarity and mainstreaming of policies (such as
addressing climate change or gender equality) and programmes and the key role of the Member States in
implementing the EU budget.

     As a result, the term 'European Commission' is used to denote both the institution – the College – formed by the
     Members of the Commission, and its administration managed by the Directors-General of its departments (and
     heads of other administrative structures such as services, offices and executive agencies).

     •   Objectives, indicators and targets are included in the programmes' legal bases and every year the
         Commission reports on them through the programme statements that accompany the draft
         budget. The latter provide the information necessary for understanding the execution of
         programmes and measuring their performance; this includes the long-term financial
         commitments under the multiannual financial framework, programme performance baselines
         (starting points for policy action), targets (to be achieved at the end of the multi-annual
         programming period), and intermediate milestones.

     •   To ensure resources are allocated to priorities and that every action brings high performance and
         added value, the Commission promotes a performance culture. Moreover, over the past years
         it has developed an approach that promotes a better balance between compliance and
         performance.

     •   The Annual Management and Performance Report for the EU budget provides a
         comprehensive overview on the performance, management and protection of the EU budget. It
         explains how the EU budget supports the European Union’s political priorities, the results
         achieved with the EU budget, and the role the Commission plays in ensuring and promoting the
         highest standards of budgetary and financial management.

These elements place the budget authority in a strong position to factor in performance information
during the annual budgetary procedure.


2.4.       THE COMMISSION’S FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT

In the Commission, the roles and responsibilities in financial management are clearly defined (e.g. in the
Financial Regulation and the Internal Rules 11) and applied accordingly. As authorising officers by
delegation, the Commission’s Directors-General and Heads of Service are responsible for the sound
financial management of EU resources, compliance with the provisions of the Financial Regulation, risk
management and establishing an appropriate internal control framework.

The responsibility of the Authorising Officers covers the entire management process, from determining
what needs to be done to achieve the policy objectives set by the institution to managing the activities
from both an operational and a sound financial management standpoint. Tasks can further be delegated
to Directors, Heads of Unit and others, who thereby become Authorising Officers by Sub-Delegation. Each
authorising officer by delegation may rely on one or two directors in charge of risk management and
internal control to oversee and monitor the implementation of internal control systems.

The Commission’s central services provide guidance and advice and promote best practices, including
through the work of the Corporate Management Board.

The Financial Regulation requires each authorising officer to prepare an annual activity report (‘AAR’) on
what has been achieved and on internal control and financial management during the year. The AAR
includes a declaration that resources have been used based on the principles of sound financial
management and that control procedures are in place which provide the necessary guarantees
concerning the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions. At Commission level, the Annual
Management and Performance Report for the EU budget is the main instrument through which the
College of Commissioners assumes political responsibility for the financial management of the
EU budget.

The Accounting Officer of the Commission is centrally responsible for treasury management, recovery
procedures, laying down accounting rules based on International Public Sector Accounting Standards and
methods, validating accounting systems and the preparation of the Commission's and consolidated
annual accounts of the EU. Furthermore, the Accounting Officer is required to sign the annual accounts
declaring that they present fairly, in all material aspects, the financial position, the results of the
operations and the cash flows of the Union. The annual accounts are adopted by the College of
Commissioners. The Accounting Officer is an independent function and bears a major responsibility as
regards financial reporting in the Commission.




11
     Since mid-2019 (further to the revised Article 12 of the Internal Rules) the management of the European
     Development Fund (EDF) is co-delegated among five departments (DEVCO, ECHO, EAC, EACEA, JRC).


                                                      7
-----------------------Page 10 End-----------------------

                                   Annual accounts of the European Union 2019

The Internal Auditor of the Commission is likewise a centralised and independent function and provides
independent advice, opinions and recommendations on the quality and functioning of internal control
systems inside the Commission, EU agencies and other autonomous bodies.

The Audit Progress Committee ensures the independence of the Internal Auditor and monitors the quality
of internal audit work and the follow-up given by the Commission to internal and external audit
recommendations, as well as to the European Court of Auditors’ discharge-related findings and
recommendations on the reliability of the annual consolidated EU accounts. The advisory role of the
committee contributes to the overall further improvement of the Commission’s effectiveness and
efficiency in achieving its goals and facilitates the College’s oversight of the Commission’s governance,
risk management, and internal control practices.


2.5.      FINANCIAL REPORTING

Reporting on the EU budget is delivered through the Integrated Financial and Accountability
Reporting package which brings together comprehensive information on the implementation,
performance, results, financial management and protection of the EU budget. This comprises the
consolidated annual accounts of the EU, the Annual Management and Performance Report for the EU
budget (which includes an evaluation on the Union’s finances based on the results achieved), the annual
report on internal audits carried out, a long-term forecast of future inflows and outflows covering the next
five years and the report on the follow-up to the discharge. The Integrated Financial and Accountability
Reporting package provides the public with a comprehensive view of the financial and operational
situation of the EU budget each year.

The consolidated annual accounts of the EU provide financial information on the activities of the
institutions, agencies and other bodies of the EU from both an accrual accounting and budgetary
perspective. These accounts do not encompass the annual accounts of Member States.

The consolidated annual accounts of the EU consist of two separate but linked parts:

    •   the consolidated financial statements; and

    •   the reports on implementation of the budget, which provide an aggregated record of budget
        implementation.

In addition, the consolidated annual accounts of the EU are accompanied by a Financial Statement
Discussion and Analysis (FSDA), which summarises significant changes and trends in the financial
statements and explains significant risks and uncertainties the EU has faced and needs to address in
future.

2.6.      EXTERNAL AUDIT AND DISCHARGE PROCEDURE

In line with the principles of sound financial management, funds must be managed in an effective,
efficient and economic manner. An accountability framework based on comprehensive reporting, external
audit and political control exists to provide reasonable assurance that EU funds are spent well in a proper
manner.

Every year the European Court of Auditors, based on a systematic and thorough approach, examines
the reliability of the accounts, whether all revenue has been received and all expenditure incurred in a
lawful and regular manner and whether the financial management and the qualitative aspects of
budgeting, including the performance dimension, have been sound. The publication of the annual report
of the European Court of Auditors is the starting point for the discharge procedure. The auditors also
prepare special reports on specific spending or policy areas, or on budgetary or management issues.

The European Parliament decides, after a recommendation by the Council, on whether or not to
provide its final approval, known as ‘granting discharge’, on the way the Commission implemented the EU
budget in a given year. The annual discharge procedure ensures that the Commission is held politically
accountable for the implementation of the EU budget.

The decision on the discharge is also based on the Commission’s integrated financial and accountability
reporting, on hearings of Commissioners and on the replies provided to written questions addressed to
the Commission.

HIGHLIGHTS OF THE FINANCIAL YEAR
2019
Implementation of the 2019 Union budget
The EU budget has an important role to support the delivery of the Union's policies and priorities. Despite
its limited amount, representing around 2% of all public spending in the Union, it complements national
budgets and has a clear focus on investment and additionality. It is a key tool among the wide set of
European-level policy and regulatory instruments, to implement policy priorities which all EU members
have agreed upon, translated into a Multiannual Financial Framework containing the different
programmes and maximum expenditure ceilings.

The EU budget for 2019, adopted on 12 December 2018, confirms that the EU is directing money to
where the needs are. In 2019, and in line with the European Commission proposal of May 2018, the
biggest part of the EU budget went to stimulate the creation of jobs, especially for young people, and to
boost growth, strategic investments and convergence. The EU has also continued supporting the efforts
to effectively deal with the migration challenge, both inside and outside the EU.

The 2019 adopted budget contributed to the strength and resilience of the European economy and to
promoting solidarity and security both within and beyond its borders. The 2019 budget was the
penultimate budget of the current multiannual financial framework (MFF). The implementation of almost
all programmes was at cruising speed, with the exception of new programmes, such as the European
Defence Industrial Development Programme (EDIDP), or actions for which the legislative process finished
recently.

The implementation of the EU budget in 2019 totalled EUR 178.8 billion in commitment appropriations,
and EUR 159.1 billion in payment appropriations. This implementation can be considered satisfactory,
with only minor adjustments made throughout the year. After amounts carried over to 2020, the
implementation reached 99.4% of commitment appropriations and 99.5% of payment appropriations.

Measures to support economic growth and reduce the economic gaps between regions amounted to
nearly half of the funds committed. EU funding contributed EUR 12.4 billion to research and innovation
under Horizon 2020, including in the field of high-performance computing. The budget increased for
education and training (20% more for Erasmus+ than in 2018) and transport and digital infrastructure
(37% more for the Connecting Europe Facility). Support for agriculture and rural areas remained stable
at EUR 57.9 billion, contributing also to the fight against climate change and to the promotion of
sustainable growth.

The 2019 budget provided the necessary flexibility to address the internal aspect of migration issues,
with a total of EUR 1.2 billion support from the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund, along with
EUR 533 million for border management and security from the Internal Security Fund. A total of
EUR 5 million was also allocated to the creation of the new European Public Prosecutor’s Office, set up to
prosecute crimes against the EU budget, including fraud, money laundering and corruption.


Financial Statements – highlights
Balance sheet

    •   Under Property, Plant and Equipment, the four satellites launched in 2018 successfully passed the
        in-orbit testing in 2019. They have been added to the operational constellation in 2019, bringing
        it up to 26 satellites – see note 2.2.

    •   Available for Sale financial assets increased by EUR 3.0 billion, due to the continued funding of
        the EFSI & EFSD guarantee funds, as well as Horizon 2020 Financial Instruments. Loans
        decreased by EUR 1.3 billion following the repayment of BOP loans by Romania and Latvia, offset
        somewhat by new MFA loans granted – see note 2.4.

    •   Pre-financing (i.e. advances paid to beneficiaries of EU funds) increased slightly by EUR 1.5 billion
        to EUR 51.4 billion – see note 2.5.

                                 Annual accounts of the European Union 2019

    •   Overall the total Receivables & Recoverables amounts remained at a similar level to last year,
        being EUR 24.0 billion – see note 2.6.

    •   A fall in the long-term interest rate used to value employee benefit obligations (the so-called
        discount rate), becoming negative for the first time, led to a significant increase in the year-end
        liability, an increase of EUR 17.2 billion – see note 2.9.

    •   The repayment of BOP borrowings of EUR 1.5 billion drove the decrease in financial liabilities,
        somewhat offset by new borrowings linked to MFA loans granted – see note 2.11.

    •   Payables and accruals remained at a similar level to 2018, EUR 94.1 billion in total – see notes
        2.12 and 2.13.

Statement of Financial Performance

    •   On the revenue side there were EUR 3.0 billion higher GNI revenue following adjustments made
        for past amounts (mostly for years 2012 to 2017) as GNI bases were updated with real data.
        Fines income was EUR 4.3 billion in 2019 – see note 3.1/3.4.

    •   Expenses incurred under shared management increased by EUR 4.8 billion, led by better
        implementation of programmes under ERDF & Cohesion fund as the current MFF advances – see
        note 3.9.

Contingent Liabilities

    •   Budgetary guarantees increased by EUR 2.7 billion due to the signing of new EFSI and ELM
        operations in 2019 that are guaranteed by the EU budget – see note 4.1.1.

                                  Annual accounts of the European Union 2019


1.         SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

1.1.       LEGAL BASIS AND ACCOUNTING RULES

The accounts of the EU are kept in accordance with Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 2018/1046 of the
European Parliament and of the Council of 18 July 2018 on the financial rules applicable to the general
budget of the Union, amending Regulations (EU) No 1296/2013, (EU) No 1301/2013, (EU) No
1303/2013, (EU) No 1304/2013, (EU) No 1309/2013, (EU) No 1316/2013, (EU) No 223/2014, (EU) No
283/2014, and Decision No 541/2014/EU and repealing Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012 (OJ L
193, 30 July 2018, p. 1) hereinafter referred to as the ‘Financial Regulation’ (FR).

In accordance with article 80 of the Financial Regulation, the EU prepares its financial statements on the
basis of accrual-based accounting rules that are based on International Public Sector Accounting
Standards (IPSAS). These accounting rules, adopted by the Accounting Officer of the Commission, have
to be applied by all the institutions and EU bodies falling within the scope of consolidation in order to
ensure the internal consistency of the EU consolidated accounts.

Application of new and amended European Union Accounting Rules (EAR)

New EAR which are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019

The following new EAR, adopted by the Accounting Officer of the Commission, became mandatorily
effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019:

     •   EAR 20 ‘Public Sector Combinations’, which is based on IPSAS 40 ‘Public Sector Combinations’,
         establishes the requirements for classifying, recognising and measuring public sector
         combinations, i.e. the bringing together of separate operations into one public sector entity.

         The standard distinguishes beween two types of public sector combinations: amalgamations and
         acquisitions. An amalgamation is a public sector combination in which either no party to the
         combination gains control on one or more operations, or, in case one party to the combination
         does gain control, there is evidence that the combination has the economic substance of an
         amalgamation (the standard provides several indicators relating to the consideration and the
         decision-making process to allow for that assessment). An acquisition is a public sector
         combination in which one party to the combination gains control of one or more operations and
         there is evidence that the combination is not an amalgamation.

         Public sector combinations which are classified as an amalgamation are accounted for by appliyng
         the modified pooling-of-interests method, which requires that the resulting entity shall recognise
         the identifiable assets, liabilities and any non-controllling interests subject to the combination at
         their carrying amount with a corresponding increase or decrease in net assets (i.e. without giving
         rise to goodwill).

         Public sector combinations which are classified as acquisitions are accounted for by applying the
         acquisition method, which requires that the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed
         are recognised at their acquisition-date fair-values, and any non-controlling interest in the
         acquired operation is recognised at the proportionate share of the acquired operations’
         identifiable net assets. Unlike an amalgamation an acquisition gives rise to goodwill (measured as
         the excess of the consideration transferred and any non-controlling interest over the net of the
         acquisition-date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed).

         The standard foresees distinct disclosure requirements in order to enable the users of the EU
         financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of an amalgamation or
         acquisition, as well as the financial effects of adjustments recognised in the current reporting
         period relating to such transactions that occurred during the period or previous reporting periods.

         Since there were no public sector combinations during the reporting period the new standard has
         no effect on the 2019 financial statements.

New EAR adopted but not yet effective at 31 December 2019

There are no new EAR adopted but not yet effective at 31 December 2019.

1.2.      ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES

The objective of financial statements is to provide information about the financial position, performance
and cashflows of an entity that is useful to a wide range of users. For the EU as a public sector entity, the
objectives are more specifically to provide information useful for decision-making, and to demonstrate
the accountability of the entity for the resources entrusted to it. It is with these goals in mind that the
present document has been drawn up.

The overall considerations (or accounting principles) to be followed when preparing the financial
statements are laid down in EU accounting rule 1 ‘Financial Statements’ and are the same as those
described in IPSAS 1: fair presentation, accrual basis, going concern, consistency of presentation,
materiality, aggregation, offsetting and comparative information.

The qualitative characteristics of financial reporting are relevance, faithful representation (reliability),
understandability, timeliness, comparability and verifiability.


1.3.      CONSOLIDATION

Scope of consolidation

The consolidated financial statements of the EU comprise all significant controlled entities, joint
arrangements and associates. The complete list of consolidated entities can be found in note 9. It now
comprises 52 controlled entities and 1 associate. Among the controlled entities are the EU institutions
(including the Commission, but not the European Central Bank) and the EU agencies (except those of the
former 2nd pillar, i.e. the Common and Foreign Security Policy). The European Coal and Steel Community
in Liquidation (ECSC i.L.) is also considered as a controlled entity. The EU’s only associate is the
European Investment Fund (EIF).

Entities falling under the scope of consolidation but immaterial to the EU consolidated financial
statements as a whole need not be consolidated or accounted for using the equity method where to do so
would result in excessive time or cost to the EU. Those entities are referred to as ‘Minor entities’ and are
separately listed in note 9. In 2019, 7 entities have been classified as such minor entities.

Controlled entities

In order to determine the scope of consolidation the control concept is applied. Controlled entities are
entities for which the EU is exposed, or has right, to variable benefits from its involvement and has the
ability to affect the nature and amount of those benefits through its power over the other entity. This
power must be presently exercisable and must relate to the relevant activities of the entity. Controlled
entities are fully consolidated. The consolidation begins at the first date on which control exists, and ends
when such control no longer exists.

The most common indicators of control within the EU are: creation of the entity through founding treaties
or secondary legislation, financing of the entity from the EU budget, the existence of voting rights in the
governing bodies, audit by the European Court of Auditors and discharge by the European Parliament. An
individual assessment for each entity is made in order to decide whether one or all of the criteria listed
above are sufficient to result in control.

All material inter-entity transactions and balances between EU controlled entities are eliminated, while
unrealised gains and losses on such transactions are not material and so have not been eliminated.

Joint Arrangements

A joint arrangement is an agreement of which the EU and one or more parties have joint control. Joint
control is the agreed sharing of control of an arrangement by way of a binding arrangement, which exists
only when decisions about the relevant activities require the unanimous consent of parties sharing
control. Joint agreements can be either joint ventures or joint operations. A joint venture is a joint
arrangement that is structured through a separate vehicle and whereby the parties that have joint control
of the arrangement have rights to the net assets of the arrangement. Participations in joint ventures are
accounted for using the equity method (see note 1.5.4). A joint operation is a joint arrangement
whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangements have rights to the assets, and obligations
for the liabilities, related to the arrangement. Participations in joint operations are accounted for by


                                                     21
-----------------------Page 24 End-----------------------

                                  Annual accounts of the European Union 2019

recognising in the EU’s financial statements its assets and liabilities, revenue and expense, as well as its
share of assets, liabilities, revenue and expense jointly held or incurred.

Associates

Associates are entities over which the EU has, directly or indirectly, significant influence but not exclusive
or joint control. It is presumed that significant influence exists if the EU holds directly or indirectly 20 %
or more of the voting rights. Participations in associates are accounted for using the equity method (see
note 1.5.4).

Non-consolidated entities the funds of which are managed by the Commission

The funds of the Joint Sickness Insurance Scheme for staff of the EU, the European Development Fund
and the Participants Guarantee Fund are managed by the Commission on their behalf. However, since
these entities are not controlled by the EU, they are not consolidated in its financial statements.


1.4.       BASIS OF PREPARATION

Financial statements are presented annually. The accounting year begins on 1 January and ends on
31 December.


1.4.1.     Currency and basis for conversion

Functional and reporting currency

The financial statements are presented in millions of euros, unless stated otherwise, the euro being the
EU’s functional currency.

Transactions and balances

Foreign currency transactions are translated into euros using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates
of the transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of foreign currency
transactions and from the re-translation at year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities
denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the statement of financial performance. Translation
differences on non-monetary financial instruments classified as available for sale financial assets are
included in the fair value reserve.

Different conversion methods apply to property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, which retain
their value in euros at the rate that applied at the date when they were purchased.

Year-end balances of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are converted into
euros on the basis of the European Central Bank (ECB) exchange rates applying on 31 December:

1.4.2.     Use of estimates

In accordance with IPSAS and generally accepted accounting principles, the financial statements
necessarily include amounts based on estimates and assumptions by management based on the most
reliable information available. Significant estimates include, but are not limited to: amounts for employee
benefit liabilities, financial risk of accounts receivable and the amounts disclosed in the notes concerning


                                                     22
-----------------------Page 25 End-----------------------

                                   Annual accounts of the European Union 2019

financial instruments, accrued revenue and charges, provisions, degree of impairment of intangible assets
and property, plant and equipment, net realisable value of inventories, contingent assets and liabilities.
Actual results could differ from those estimates. Changes in estimates are reflected in the period in which
they become known, if the change affects the period only, or that period and future periods, if the change
affects both.


1.5.      BALANCE SHEET

1.5.1.    Intangible assets

An intangible asset is an identifiable non-monetary asset without physical substance. An asset is
identifiable if it is either separable (i.e. it is capable of being separated or divided from the entity, e.g. by
being sold, transferred, licensed, rented, or exchanged, either individually or together with a related
contract, identifiable asset or liability, regardless of whether the entity intends to do so), or arises from
binding arrangements (including rights from contracts or other legal rights), regardless of whether those
rights are transferable or separable from the entity or from other rights and obligations).

Acquired intangible assets are stated at historical cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment
losses. Internally developed intangible assets are capitalised when the relevant criteria of the EU
Accounting Rules are met and the expenses relate solely to the development phase of the asset. The
capitalisable costs include all directly attributable costs necessary to create, produce, and prepare the
asset to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management. Costs associated with research
activities, non-capitalisable development costs and maintenance costs are recognised as expenses as
incurred.

Intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives (3 to 11 years).
The estimated useful lives of intangible assets depend on their specific economic lifetime or legal lifetime
determined by an agreement.


1.5.2.    Property, plant and equipment

All property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and
impairment losses. Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition, construction
or transfer of the asset.

Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as
appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits or service potential associated with
the item will flow to the EU and its cost can be measured reliably. Repairs and maintenance costs are
charged to the statement of financial performance during the financial period in which they are incurred.

Land is not depreciated as it is deemed to have an indefinite useful life. Assets under construction are not
depreciated, as these assets are not yet available for use. Depreciation on other assets is calculated using
the straight-line method to allocate their cost less their residual values over their estimated useful lives,
as follows:

 Type of asset                                                     Straight line depreciation rate
 Buildings                                                                    4 % to 10 %
 Space assets                                                                 8 % to 25 %
 Plant and equipment                                                         10 % to 25 %
 Furniture and vehicles                                                      10 % to 25 %
 Computer hardware                                                           25 % to 33 %
 Other                                                                       10 % to 33 %

Gains or losses on disposals are determined by comparing proceeds less selling expenses with the
carrying amount of the disposed asset and are included in the statement of financial performance.

Leases

A lease is an agreement whereby the lessor conveys to the lessee in return for a payment or series of
payments the right to use an asset for an agreed period of time. Leases are classified as either finance
leases or operating leases.

Finance leases are leases where substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership are
transferred to the lessee. When entering a finance lease as a lessee, the assets acquired under the
finance lease are recognised as assets and the associated lease obligations as liabilities as from the
commencement of the lease term. The assets and liabilities are recognised at amounts equal to the fair
value of the leased property or, if lower, the present value of the minimum lease payments, each
determined at the inception of the lease. Over the period of the lease term, the assets held under finance
leases are depreciated over the shorter of the asset’s useful life and the lease term. The minimum lease
payments are apportioned between the finance charge (the interest element) and the reduction of the
outstanding liability (the capital element). The finance charge is allocated to each period during the lease
term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability, which
is presented as current/non-current, as applicable. Contingent rents are charged as expenses in the
period in which they are incurred.

An operating lease is a lease other than a finance lease, i.e. a lease where the lessor retains substantially
all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of an asset. When entering an operating lease as a
lessee, the operating lease payments are recognised as an expense in the statement of financial
performance on a straight-line basis over the lease term with neither a leased asset nor a leasing liability
presented in the statement of financial position.


1.5.3.    Impairment of non-financial assets

An impairment is a loss in the future economic benefits or service potential of an asset, over and above
the systematic recognition of the loss of the asset's future economic benefits or service potential through
amortisation or depreciation (as applicable). Assets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to
amortisation/depreciation and are tested annually for impairment. Assets that are subject to
amortisation/depreciation are tested for impairment whenever there is an indication at the reporting date
that an asset may be impaired. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s
carrying amount exceeds its recoverable (service) amount. The recoverable (service) amount is the
higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and its value in use.

Intangible assets and property, plant and equipment residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and
adjusted if appropriate, at least once per year. If the reasons for impairments recognised in previous
years no longer apply, the impairment losses are reversed accordingly.


1.5.4.    Investments accounted for using the equity method

Participations in associates and joint ventures

Investments accounted for using the equity method are initially recognised at cost, with the initial
carrying amount subsequently being increased or decreased to recognise further contributions, the EU’s
share of the surplus or deficit of the investee, any impairments and dividends. The initial cost together
with all movements give the carrying amount of the investment in the financial statements at the balance
sheet date. The EU’s share of the investee’s surplus or deficit is recognised in the statement of financial
performance, and its share of investee’s movements in equity is recognised in the reserves within net
assets. Distributions received from the investment reduce the carrying amount of the asset.

If the EU's share of deficits of an investment accounted for using the equity method equals or exceeds its
interest in the investment, the EU discontinues recognising its share of further losses (‘unrecognised
losses’). After the EU’s interest is reduced to zero, additional losses are provided for and a liability is
recognised only to the extent that the EU has incurred legal or constructive obligation or made payments
on behalf of the entity.

If there are indications of impairment, a write-down to the lower recoverable amount is necessary. The
recoverable amount is determined as described under note 1.5.3. If the reason for impairment ceases to
apply at a later date, the impairment loss is reversed to the carrying amount that would have been
determined had no impairment loss been recognised.


                                                     24
-----------------------Page 27 End-----------------------

                                   Annual accounts of the European Union 2019

In cases where the EU holds 20 % or more of an investment capital fund, it does not seek to exert
significant influence. Such funds are therefore treated as financial instruments and categorised as
available for sale financial assets.

Associates and joint ventures classified as minor entities (see note 1.3) are not accounted for under the
equity method. EU contributions to those entities are accounted for as an expense of the period.


1.5.5.    Financial assets

Classification

The EU classifies their financial assets in the categories ‘financial assets at fair value through surplus or
deficit’, ‘loans and receivables’, ‘held-to-maturity investments’ and ‘available for sale financial assets’.
The classification of financial instruments is determined at initial recognition and re-evaluated at each
balance sheet date.

(i) Financial assets at fair value through surplus or deficit

A financial asset is classified in the category ‘fair value through surplus or deficit’ if acquired principally
for the purpose of being sold in the short term, or if so designated by the entity. Derivatives are also
presented in this category. Assets in this category are classified as current assets if they are expected to
be realised within 12 months of the balance sheet date.

(ii) Loans and receivables

Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are
not quoted in an active market. They arise when the EU provides money, goods or services directly to a
debtor with no intention of trading the receivable, or in case the EU is subrogated to the rights of the
original lender following a payment made by the EU under a guarantee contract. Payments due within 12
months of the balance sheet date are classified as current assets. Payments due after 12 months from
the balance sheet date are classified as non-current assets. Loans and receivables include term deposits
with the original maturity above three months.

(iii) Held-to-maturity investments

Held-to-maturity investments are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments
and fixed maturities that the EU has the positive intention and ability to hold to maturity. During this
financial year, the EU did not hold any investments in this category.

(iv) Available for sale financial assets

Available for sale financial assets are non-derivatives that are either designated in this category or not
classified in any of the other categories. They are classified as either current or non-current assets,
depending on the period of time the EU expects to hold them. Investments in entities that are neither
consolidated nor accounted for using the equity method and other equity-type investments (e.g. Risk
Capital Operations) are also classified as available for sale financial assets.

Initial recognition and measurement

Purchases and sales of financial assets classified as ‘at fair value through surplus or deficit, ‘held-to-
maturity’ or ‘available for sale’ are recognised on their trade-date – the date on which the EU commits to
purchase or sell the asset. Cash equivalents and loans are recognised when cash is deposited in a
financial institution or advanced to borrowers. Financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value.
For all financial assets not carried at fair value through surplus or deficit, transactions costs are added to
the fair value at initial recognition. Financial assets carried at fair value through surplus or deficit are
initially recognised at fair value and transaction costs are expensed in the statement of financial
performance.

The fair value of a financial asset on initial recognition is normally the transaction price (i.e. the fair value
of the consideration received), unless the fair value of that instrument is evidenced by comparison with
other observable current market transactions in the same instrument or based on a valuation technique
whose variables include only data from observable markets (e.g. in case of some derivative contracts).
However, when a long-term loan that carries no interest or an interest below market conditions is


                                                      25
-----------------------Page 28 End-----------------------

                                 Annual accounts of the European Union 2019

granted, its fair value can be estimated as the present value of all future cash receipts discounted using
the prevailing market rate of interest for a similar instrument with a similar credit rating.

Loans granted are measured at their nominal amount, which is considered to be the fair value of the
loan. The reasoning for this is as follows:

   •    The ‘market environment’ for EU lending is very specific and different from the capital market
        used to issue commercial or government bonds. As lenders in these markets have the
        opportunity to choose alternative investments, the opportunity possibility is factored into market
        prices. However, this opportunity for alternative investments does not exist for the EU, which is
        not allowed to invest money on the capital markets; it only borrows funds for the purpose of
        lending at the same rate. This means that there is no alternative lending or investment option
        available to the EU for the sums borrowed. Thus, there is no opportunity cost and therefore no
        basis of comparison with market rates. In fact, the EU lending operation itself represents the
        market. Essentially, since the opportunity cost ‘option’ is not applicable, the market price does
        not fairly reflect the substance of the EU lending transactions. Therefore, it is not appropriate to
        determine the fair value of EU lending with reference to commercial or government bonds.

   •    Furthermore, as there is no active market or similar transactions to compare with, the interest
        rate to be used by the EU for fair valuing its lending operations under the EFSM, BOP and other
        such loans, should be the interest rate charged.

   •    In addition, for these loans, there are compensating effects between loans and borrowings due to
        their back-to-back character. Thus, the effective interest for the loan equals the effective interest
        rate for the related borrowings. The transaction costs incurred by the EU and then recharged to
        the beneficiary of the loan are directly recognised in the statement of financial performance.

Financial instruments are derecognised when the rights to receive cashflows from the investments have
expired or the EU has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership to another party.

Subsequent measurement

   a) Financial assets at fair value through surplus or deficit are subsequently carried at fair value.
      Gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of the ‘financial instruments at fair value
      through surplus or deficit’ category are included in the statement of financial performance in the
      period in which they arise.

   b) Loans and receivables are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method. In the
      case of loans granted on borrowed funds, the same effective interest rate is applied to both the
      loans and borrowings since these loans have the characteristics of ‘back-to-back operations’ and
      the differences between the loan and the borrowing conditions and amounts are not material. The
      transaction costs incurred by the EU and then recharged to the beneficiary of the loan are directly
      recognised in the statement of financial performance.

   c)   Held to maturity assets are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method. The EU
        currently holds no held to maturity investments.

   d) Available for sale financial assets are subsequently carried at fair value. Gains and losses arising
      from changes in the fair value of available for sale financial assets are recognised in the fair value
      reserve, except for translation differences on monetary assets, which are recognised in the
      statement of financial performance. When assets classified as available for sale financial assets
      are derecognised or impaired, the cumulative fair value adjustments previously recognised in the
      fair value reserve are recognised in the statement of financial performance. Interest on available
      for sale financial assets calculated using the effective interest method is recognised in the
      statement of financial performance. Dividends on available for sale equity instruments are
      recognised when the EU’s right to receive payment is established.

The fair values of quoted investments in active markets are based on current bid prices. If the market for
a financial asset is not active (and for unlisted securities and over-the–counter derivatives), the EU
establishes a fair value by using valuation techniques. These include the use of recent arm’s length
transactions, reference to other instruments that are substantially the same, discounted cashflow
analysis, option pricing models and other valuation techniques commonly used by market participants.




                                                    26
-----------------------Page 29 End-----------------------

                                  Annual accounts of the European Union 2019

Investments in Venture Capital Funds, classified as available for sale financial assets, which do not have a
quoted market price in an active market are valued at the attributable net asset value, which is
considered as an equivalent of their fair value.

In cases where the fair value of investments in equity instruments that do not have a quoted market
price in an active market cannot be reliably measured, these investments are valued at cost less
impairment losses.

Impairment of financial assets

A financial asset is impaired and a loss is recognised if, and only if, there is objective evidence of
impairment as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the asset and
that loss event (or events) has an impact on the estimated future cashflows of the financial asset that
can be reliably estimated. The EU assesses at each reporting date whether there is objective evidence
that a financial asset is impaired.

(a)       Assets carried at amortised cost

If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss on loans and receivables or held-to-maturity
investments carried at amortised cost has been incurred, the amount of the loss is measured as the
difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cashflows
(excluding future credit losses that have not been incurred) discounted at the financial asset’s original
effective interest rate. The carrying amount of the asset is reduced and the amount of the loss is
recognised in the statement of financial performance. If a loan or held-to-maturity investment has a
variable interest rate, the discount rate for measuring any impairment loss is the current effective
interest rate determined under the contract. The calculation of the present value of the estimated future
cashflows of a collateralised financial asset reflects the cashflows that may result from foreclosure less
costs for obtaining and selling the collateral, whether or not foreclosure is probable. If, in a subsequent
period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an
event occurring after the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised impairment loss is
reversed through the statement of financial performance.

(b)       Assets carried at fair value

In the case of equity investments classified as available for sale financial assets, a significant or
permanent (prolonged) decline in the fair value of the security below its cost is considered in determining
whether the securities are impaired. If any such evidence exists for available for sale financial assets, the
cumulative loss – measured as the difference between the acquisition cost and the current fair value, less
any impairment loss on that financial asset previously recognised in the statement of financial
performance – is removed from reserves and recognised in the statement of financial performance.
Impairment losses recognised in the statement of financial performance on equity instruments are not
reversed through the statement of financial performance. If, in a subsequent period, the fair value of a
debt instrument classified as available for sale financial asset increases and the increase can be
objectively related to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised, the impairment loss is
reversed through the statement of financial performance.


1.5.6.    Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is determined using the first-in,
first-out (FIFO) method. The cost of finished goods and work in progress comprises raw materials, direct
labour, other directly attributable costs and related production overheads (based on normal operating
capacity). Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the
costs of completion and selling expenses. When inventories are held for distribution at no charge or for a
nominal charge, they are measured at the lower of cost and current replacement cost. Current
replacement cost is the cost the EU would incur to acquire the asset on the reporting date.


1.5.7.    Pre-financing amounts

Pre-financing is a payment intended to provide the beneficiary with a cash advance, i.e. a float. It may be
split into a number of payments over a period defined in the particular contract, decision, agreement or
basic legal act. The float or advance is either used for the purpose for which it was provided during the
period defined in the agreement or it is repaid. If the beneficiary does not incur eligible expenditure, they


                                                     27
-----------------------Page 30 End-----------------------

                                  Annual accounts of the European Union 2019

have the obligation to return the pre-financing advance to the EU. As the EU retains control over the pre-
financing and is entitled to a refund for the ineligible part, the amount is presented as an asset.

Pre-financing is initially recognised on the balance sheet when cash is transferred to the recipient. It is
measured at the amount of the consideration given. In subsequent periods pre-financing is measured at
the amount initially recognised on the balance sheet less the eligible expenses (including estimated
amounts where necessary) incurred during the period.

Interest on pre-financing is recognised as it is earned in accordance with the provisions of the relevant
agreement. An estimate of the accrued interest revenue, based on the most reliable information, is made
at the year-end and included in the balance sheet.

Other advances to Member States which originate from reimbursement by the EU of amounts paid as
advances by the Member States to their beneficiaries (including ‘financial instruments under shared
management’) are recognised as assets and presented under the heading ‘Pre-financing’. Other advances
to Member States are subsequently measured at the amount initially recognised on the balance sheet
less a best estimate of the eligible expenses incurred by final beneficiaries, calculated on the basis of
reasonable and supportable assumptions.

The EU contributions to the trust funds of the European Development Fund or other unconsolidated
entities are also classified as pre-financing since their purpose is to give a float to the trust fund to allow
it to finance specific actions defined under the trust fund’s objectives. The EU contributions to trust funds
are measured at the initial amount of the EU contribution less eligible expenses, including estimated
amounts where necessary, incurred by the trust fund during the reporting period and allocated to the EU
contribution in accordance with the underlying agreement.


1.5.8.    Exchange receivables and non-exchange recoverables

The EU Accounting Rules require a separate presentation of exchange and non-exchange transactions. To
distinguish between the two categories, the term ‘receivables’ is reserved for exchange transactions,
whereas for ‘non-exchange transactions’, i.e. when the EU receives value from another entity without
directly giving approximately equal value in exchange, the term ‘recoverables’ is used (e.g. recoverables
from Member States related to own resources).

Receivables from exchange transactions meet the definition of financial instruments and are thus
classified as loans and receivables and measured accordingly (see note 1.5.5). The financial instruments
notes disclosures concerning receivables from exchange transactions include accrued revenue and
deferred charges from exchange transactions, as they are not material. A general write-down based on
past experience is made for outstanding recovery orders not already subject to a specific write-down.

Recoverables from non-exchange transactions are carried at fair value as at the date of acquisition
(adjusted for interest and penalties) less write-down for impairment. A write-down for impairment of
recoverables from non-exchange transactions is established when there is objective evidence that the EU
will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of recoverables from non-
exchange transactions. The amount of the write-down is the difference between the asset’s carrying
amount and the recoverable amount. The amount of the write-down is recognised in the statement of
financial performance. A general write-down, based on past experience, is also made for outstanding
recovery orders not already subject to a specific write-down. See note 1.5.14 concerning the treatment
of accrued revenue at year-end. Amounts displayed and disclosed as recoverables from non-exchanges
transactions are not financial instruments, as they do not arise from a contract that would give rise to a
financial liability or equity instrument. However, in the notes to the financial statements recoverables
from non-exchange transactions are disclosed together with receivables from exchange transactions
where appropriate.


1.5.9.    Cash and cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents are financial instruments and include cash at hand, deposits held at call or at
short notice with banks and other short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three
months or less.




                                                     28

                                       Annual accounts of the European Union 2019

1.5.10. Employee benefits

The EU provides a set of benefits (emoluments and social security) to employees. For accounting
purposes these have to be classified into short-term and post-employment benefits.

Short-term employee benefits

Short-term employee benefits are those benefits due to be settled before twelve months after the end of
the reporting period in which employees rendered the service, such as salaries, annual and paid sick
leaves, and other short-term allowances. Short-term employee benefits are recognised as an expense
when the related service is provided. A liability is recognised for the amount expected to be paid if the EU
has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay as a result of past service provided by the employee
and the obligation can be estimated reliably.

Post-employment benefits

The EU grants a set of post-employment benefits to employees, which include retirement, invalidity and
survival pensions provided under the Pension Scheme of the European Officials (PSEO), as well as
medical coverage provided under the Joint Sickness Insurance Scheme (JSIS) (see note 2.9). These
benefits are provided under a single plan – although split in two schemes – and they must be treated
similarly so as to give a fair presentation of the situation and reflect the economic reality:

     i.    Pension Scheme of European Officials (PSEO): The benefits granted under this notionally funded 12
           scheme relate to seniority, invalidity and survival, as well as, family allowances, death before
           retirement to those employees that work or worked in the EU Institutions, Agencies and other EU
           bodies or are survivors of deceased officials or pensioners. Staff contribute one third of the
           expected cost of these benefits from their salaries.

     ii.   Joint Sickness Insurance Scheme (JSIS): Under this scheme, the EU provides health coverage for
           staff of the European Commission, Institutions, Agencies and other EU bodies through the
           reimbursement of medical expenses. The benefits granted to the ‘inactives’ of this scheme (i.e.
           pensioners, orphans, etc.) are classified as post-employment benefits.

The EU also provides post-employment benefits to members of the EU institutions via separate pension
schemes. These are shown under the heading ‘Other retirement benefit schemes’. Under these schemes
the EU provides pension benefits to members of the Commission, Court of Justice and General Court,
Court of Auditors, Council, European Parliament, Ombudsman, Data Protection Supervisor, Civil Service
Tribunal. The EU provides health coverage to the members of the EU Institutions via the JSIS.

The above post-employment benefits qualify as defined benefit obligations of the EU and are calculated at
each reporting date by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in the
current and prior periods, discounting that amount and deducting the fair value of any plan assets. The
calculation of defined benefit obligation is performed annually using the projected unit credit method. The
present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash
outflows using interest rates of government bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the
benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension
liability.

The post-employment benefits provided to EU staff are incorporated in a single plan comprising both a
pension scheme (PSEO) and a sickness insurance scheme (JSIS), with the right to coverage under the
JSIS scheme being dependent on having acquired the right to coverage under the PSEO scheme. Under
the terms of this single plan, as set out in the Staff Regulation, certain entitlements, such as the right to
a deferred and reduced pension under the PSEO scheme, are acquired after 10 years of service.
However, the entitlements acquired under the single plan by the employee’s subsequent service are
materially higher than those initial entitlements as reflected by subsequent annually accrued pension
rights.




12
      The PSEO is a notional (virtual) fund with defined benefits in which staff’s contributions serve to finance their
      future pensions. Although there is no actual investment fund, the amount that would have been collected by such a
      fund is considered to have been invested in the Member States’ long-term bonds and is reflected in the pension
      liability that is registered in the annual accounts of the European Union. Member States jointly guarantee the
      payment of the benefits pursuant to Article 83 of the Staff Regulations and Article 4(3) of the Treaty on European
      Union (see COM(2018) 829 for a detailed description of the scheme).

                                                           29
-----------------------Page 32 End-----------------------

                                   Annual accounts of the European Union 2019

Therefore, in order to depict the economic substance of the underlying transaction required by the faithful
representation qualitative characteristic of financial reporting as outlined in both EAR 1 and the IPSAS
Conceptual Framework, the service cost incurred is accrued on a straight-line basis over staff’s estimated
active service period, i.e. the period from the date when service by the employee first leads to benefits
under the plan (whether or not the benefits are conditional on further service) until the date when further
service by the employee will lead to no material amount of further benefits under the plan, other than
from further salary increases. This approach is applied consistently to the benefits provided for under the
single plan.

Remeasurements of the net defined benefit liability comprise actuarial gains and losses and the return on
plan assets, and are recognised immediately in net assets.

The EU recognises the net interest expense (income) and other expenses related to the defined benefit
plans in the statement of financial performance within the caption ‘staff and pension costs’.

When benefits provided are changed or curtailed, the resulting change in benefits that relates to past
service or the gain or loss on curtailment is recognised immediately in the statement of financial
performance. Gains and losses on settlement are recognised when the settlement occurs. Past service
cost is recognised immediately in the statement of financial performance, unless the changes are
conditional on the employees remaining in service for a specified period of time.


1.5.11. Provisions

Provisions are recognised when the EU has a present legal or constructive obligation towards third parties
as a result of past events, it is more likely than not that an outflow of resources will be required to settle
the obligation, and the amount can be reliably estimated. Provisions are not recognised for future
operating losses. The amount of the provision is the best estimate of the expenses expected to be
required to settle the present obligation at the reporting date. Where the provision involves a large
number of items, the obligation is estimated by weighting all possible outcomes by their associated
probabilities (‘expected value’ method).

Provisions for onerous contracts are measured at the present value of the lower of the expected cost of
terminating the contract and the expected net cost of continuing with the contract.


1.5.12. Financial liabilities

Financial liabilities are classified as financial liabilities at fair value through surplus or deficit, financial
liabilities carried at amortised cost or as financial guarantee liabilities.

Borrowings are composed of borrowings from credit institutions and debts evidenced by certificates. They
are recognised initially at fair value, being their issue proceeds (fair value of consideration received) net
of transaction costs incurred, then subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest
method; any difference between proceeds, net of transaction costs, and the redemption value is
recognised in the statement of financial performance over the period of the borrowings using the effective
interest method. In the case of loans granted on borrowed funds, the effective interest method may not
be applied to loans and borrowings, based on materiality considerations. The transaction costs incurred
by the EU and then recharged to the beneficiary of the loan are directly recognised in the statement of
financial performance.

Financial liabilities categorised at fair value through surplus or deficit include derivatives where fair value
is negative. They follow the same accounting treatment as financial assets at fair value through surplus
or deficit, see note 1.5.5.

Financial guarantee liabilities are initially recognised at fair value, being the premium received.
Subsequently, financial guarantee liabilities are measured at the higher of the best estimate of the
expenses expected to be required to settle the financial guarantee liability and the amount initially
recognised less, when appropriate, cumulative amortisation. The EU recognises a financial guarantee
liability when it receives consideration for granting of the guarantee, that is at market terms, or when the
fair value of the guarantee can be measured reliably. In case no active market for a directly equivalent
guarantee contract exists, the EU discloses the guarantee given as a contingent liability (see note 1.7.2)
or – when it is more likely than not that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation –
the EU recognises a provision (see note 1.5.11).


                                                      30
-----------------------Page 33 End-----------------------

                                  Annual accounts of the European Union 2019

Financial liabilities are classified as non-current liabilities, except for maturities less than 12 months after
the balance sheet date.

EU trust funds that are considered as part of the Commission’s operational activities are accounted for in
the Commission accounts and further consolidated in the EU annual accounts. Therefore, contributions
from other donors to the EU trust funds fulfil the criteria of revenues from non-exchange transactions
under conditions and they are presented as financial liabilities until the conditions attached to the
contributions transferred are met, i.e. eligible costs are incurred by the trust fund. The trust fund is
required to finance specific projects and return remaining funds at the time of winding-up. At the balance
sheet date the outstanding contribution liabilities are measured at contributions received less the
expenses incurred by the trust fund, including estimated amounts when necessary. For reporting
purposes the net expenses are allocated to the contributions of other donors in proportion to net
contributions paid as at 31 December. This allocation of contributions is only indicative. When the trust
fund is wound up the actual split of remaining resources will be decided by the trust fund board.


1.5.13. Payables

A significant amount of the payables of the EU are unpaid cost claims from beneficiaries of grants or
other EU funding (non-exchange transactions). They are recorded as payables for the requested amount
when the cost claim is received. Upon verification and acceptance of the eligible costs, the payables are
valued at the accepted and eligible amount.

Payables arising from the purchase of goods and services are recognised at invoice reception for the
original amount and corresponding expenses are entered in the accounts when the supplies or services
are delivered and accepted by the EU.


1.5.14. Accrued and deferred revenue and charges

Transactions and events are recognised in the financial statements in the period to which they relate. At
year-end, if an invoice is not yet issued but the service has been rendered, the supplies have been
delivered by the EU or a contractual agreement exists (e.g. by reference to a treaty), an accrued revenue
will be recognised in the financial statements. In addition, at year-end, if an invoice is issued but the
services have not yet been rendered or the goods supplied have not yet been delivered, the revenue will
be deferred and recognised in the subsequent accounting period.

Expenses are also accounted for in the period to which they relate. At the end of the accounting period,
accrued expenses are recognised based on an estimated amount of the transfer obligation of the period.
The calculation of accrued expenses is done in accordance with detailed operational and practical
guidelines issued by the Commission which aim at ensuring that the financial statements provide a
faithful representation of the economic and other phenomena they purport to represent. By analogy, if
payment has been made in advance for services or goods that have not yet been received, the expense
will be deferred and recognised in the subsequent accounting period.


1.6.      STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE

1.6.1.    Revenue

REVENUE FROM NON-EXCHANGE TRANSACTIONS

The vast majority of the EU’s revenue relates to non-exchange transactions:

GNI based resources and VAT resources

Revenue is recognised for the period for which the Commission sends out a call for funds to the Member
States claiming their contribution. They are measured at their ‘called amount’. As VAT and GNI resources
are based on estimates of the data for the budgetary year concerned, they may be revised as changes
occur until the final data are issued by the Member States. The effect of a change in estimate is included
when determining the net surplus or deficit for the period in which the change occurred.

                                 Annual accounts of the European Union 2019

Traditional own resources

Recoverables from non-exchange transactions and related revenues are recognised when the relevant
monthly ‘A’ statements (including duties collected and amounts due that are guaranteed and not
contested) are received from the Member States. At the reporting date, revenue collected by the Member
States for the period but not yet paid to the Commission is estimated and recognised as accrued revenue.
The quarterly ‘B’ statements (including duties neither collected nor guaranteed, as well as guaranteed
amounts that have been contested by the debtor) received from the Member States are recognised as
revenue less the collection costs to which they are entitled. In addition, a value reduction is recognised
for the amount of the estimated recovery gap.

Fines

Revenue from fines is recognised when the EU’s decision imposing a fine has been taken and it is
officially notified to the addressee. After the decision to impose a fine, the undertakings have two months
from the date of notification:

    a) either to accept the decision, in which case they must pay the fine within the time limit laid down
       and the amount is definitively collected by the EU; or

    b) not to accept the decision, in which case they lodge an appeal under EU law.

Even if appealed, the fine must be paid within the time limit of three months laid down as the appeal
does not have suspensory effect (Article 278 TFEU). The cash received is used to clear the recoverable.
However, subject to the agreement of the Commission’s Accounting Officer, the undertaking may present
a bank guarantee for the amount instead. In that case the fine remains as a recoverable. If neither cash
nor a guarantee is received and there are doubts about the undertaking’s solvency, a value reduction on
the entitlement is recognised.

In case the undertaking appeals against the decision, and has already provisionally paid the fine, the
amount is disclosed as a contingent liability, or, if it appears probable that the General Court may not
rule in favour of the EU, a provision is recognised to cover this risk. If a guarantee had been given
instead, the outstanding recoverable is written down as required.

The accumulated interest received by the Commission on the bank accounts where received payments
are deposited is recognised as revenue, and any contingent liability is increased accordingly.

Since 2010, all provisionally cashed fines are managed by the Commission in a specifically created fund
(BUFI) and invested in financial instruments.

REVENUE FROM EXCHANGE TRANSACTIONS

Revenue from the sale of goods and services is recognised when the significant risk and rewards of
ownership of the goods are transferred to the purchaser. Revenue associated with a transaction involving
the provision of services is recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the transaction at the
reporting date.

Interest revenue and expense

Interest revenue and expense are recognised in the statement of financial performance using the
effective interest method. This is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial asset or a
financial liability and of allocating the interest revenue or interest expense over the relevant period. When
calculating the effective interest rate, the EU estimates cashflows considering all contractual terms of the
financial instrument (for example prepayment options) but does not consider future credit losses. The
calculation includes all fees and points paid or received between parties to the contract that are an
integral part of the effective interest rate, transaction costs and all other premiums or discounts.

Once a financial asset or a group of similar financial assets has been written down as a result of an
impairment loss, interest revenue is recognised using the rate of interest to discount the future cashflows
for the purpose of measuring the impairment loss.

Revenue from dividends

Revenue from dividends and similar distributions is recognised when the right to receive payment is
established.


1.6.2.    Expenses

Expenses from non-exchange transactions account for the majority of the EU’s expenses. They relate to
transfers to beneficiaries and can be of three types: entitlements, transfers under agreement and
discretionary grants, contributions and donations.

Transfers are recognised as expenses in the period during which the events giving rise to the transfer
occurred, as long as the nature of the transfer is allowed by regulation (Financial Regulation, Staff
Regulations, or other regulation) or an agreement has been signed authorising the transfer, any eligibility
criteria have been met by the beneficiary, and a reasonable estimate of the amount can be made.

When a request for payment or cost claim is received and meets the recognition criteria, it is recognised
as an expense for the eligible amount. At year-end, incurred eligible expenses due to the beneficiaries
but not yet reported are estimated and recorded as accrued expenses.

Expenses from exchange transactions arising from the purchase of goods and services are recognised
when the supplies are delivered and accepted by the EU. They are valued at their original invoice
amount. Furthermore, at the balance sheet date expenses related to the service delivered during the
period for which an invoice has not yet been received or accepted are estimated and recognised in the
statement of financial performance.


1.7.      CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES

1.7.1.    Contingent assets

A contingent asset is a possible asset that arises from past events and of which the existence will be
confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly
within the control of the EU. A contingent asset is disclosed when an inflow of economic benefits or
service potential is probable.


1.7.2.    Contingent liabilities

A contingent liability is a possible obligation that arises from past events and of which the existence will
be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly
within the control of the EU, or a present obligation that arises from past events but is not recognised
either because it is not probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits or service
potential will be required to settle the obligation, or in the rare circumstances where the amount of the
obligation cannot be measured with sufficient reliability. A contingent liability is disclosed unless the
possibility of an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits or service potential is remote.


1.8.      CASHFLOW STATEMENT

Cashflow information is used to provide a basis for assessing the ability of the EU to generate cash and
cash equivalents, and its needs to utilise those cashflows.

The cashflow statement is prepared using the indirect method. This means that the economic result for
the financial year is adjusted for the effects of transactions of a non-cash nature, any deferrals or
accruals of past or future operating cash receipts or payments, and items of revenue or expense
associated with investing cashflows.

Cashflows arising from transactions in a foreign currency are recorded in the EU’s reporting currency
(Euro), by applying to the foreign currency amount the exchange rate between the euro and the foreign
currency at the date of the cashflow.

-----------------------Page 36 End-----------------------

                                  Annual accounts of the European Union 2019

The cashflow statement reports cashflows during the period classified by operating and investing
activities (the EU does not have financing activities).

Operating activities are the activities of the EU that are not investing activities. These are the majority of
the activities performed. Loans granted to beneficiaries (and the related borrowings, when applicable) are
not considered as investing (or financing) activities as they are part of the general objectives and thus
daily operations of the EU.

Investing activities are the acquisition and disposal of intangible assets and property, plant and
equipment and of other investments which are not included in cash equivalents. Investing activities do
not include loans granted to beneficiaries. The objective is to show the real investments made by the EU.

2.2.      PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT

The space assets category covers operational fixed assets related to the two EU space programmes: the
Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), i.e. Galileo and EGNOS, and the Copernicus European Earth
observation programme, while assets of the space systems which are not yet operational are included
under the assets under construction heading.

For Galileo, the four satellites launched in 2018 successfully passed the in-orbit testing.They have been
added to the operational constellation in 2019 bringing the total to 26 satellites. The Galileo operational
fixed assets, covering both satellites and ground installations, amounted to EUR 2 489 million at 31
December 2019, net of accumulated depreciation (2018: EUR 2 410 million). The remaining assets under
construction total EUR 1 361 million (2018: EUR 1 324 million). The development of the Galileo system
will continue until the system reaches its full operational capacity. When completed, the Galileo
constellation will comprise 30 satellites (including 6 spare satellites).

Regarding Copernicus, no new satellites became operational in 2019. The total value of Copernicus
operational fixed assets is EUR 1 153 million (2018: EUR 1 455 million), net of accumulated depreciation.
A further EUR 1 453 million related to Copernicus satellites is recognised as assets under construction
(2018: EUR 1 207 million).

Fixed assets related to the European Geostationary Navigation Overlay System (EGNOS) ground
infrastructure of EUR 37 million (2018: EUR 52 million) are also included under the Space assets heading.
In addition, EGNOS assets under construction amount to EUR 238 million (2018: EUR 130 million).

The assets related to the EU space programmes are being built with the assistance of the European
Space Agency (ESA).

2.3.      INVESTMENTS ACCOUNTED FOR USING THE EQUITY
          METHOD

The participation of the EU, represented by the Commission, in the European Investment Fund (EIF) is
treated as an associate using the equity method of accounting. The EIF is the EU's financial institution
specialising in providing risk capital and guarantees to Small and Medium-sized Entities (SMEs). The EIF
is located in Luxembourg and operates as a private-public partnership, whose members are the European
Investment Bank (EIB), the EU and a group of financial institutions. At 31 December 2019, the EU held
29.7 % of ownership interests in the EIF (2018: 29.7 %) and 29.7 % of the voting rights (2018:
29.7 %). In accordance with its statutes, the EIF is required to allocate at least 20 % of its annual net
result to a statutory reserve, until the aggregate reserve amounts to 10 % of subscribed capital. This
reserve is not available for distribution.

                                                                                                EUR million

ECSC in Liquidation

Regarding the European Coal and Steel Community in Liquidation (ECSC i.L.), all available for sale
financial assets are debt securities denominated in EUR and quoted in an active market.

European Bank for Reconstruction and Development

The EU holds a financial investment in the capital of the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development (EBRD), in which the number of shares held at 31 December 2019 were 90 044
(2018: 90 044 shares), representing 3 % of the total subscribed share capital. The EU subscribed for a
total amount of EUR 900 million of share capital, out of which EUR 713 million is currently uncalled.
According to the agreement establishing the EBRD, the shareholders have some contractual restrictions
such as the fact that the shares are not transferable and their redemption is capped at the maximum of
the original purchase cost.

The EU measures the investment in EBRD at fair value. The original purchase cost is considered to be the
best estimate of the fair value, in particular due to contractual restrictions referred to above. Although
EBRD's shares are not quoted on any stock exchange market, there were recent transactions in the
investee's equity (issuance of capital at par value), indicating that the cost is the best estimate of the fair
value in this situation.

GUARANTEE FUNDS FOR BUDGETARY GUARANTEES

EFSI Guarantee Fund

Pursuant to the EFSI Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2015/2017), the EFSI Guarantee Fund has been
established to provide a liquidity cushion against potential losses incurred by the EIB in relation to its
financing and investment operations eligible for the EFSI EU guarantee under the EFSI Agreement – see
note 4.1.1. The EFSI Guarantee Fund is financed by contributions from the EU budget. It is also endowed
by returns on guarantee fund resources invested, revenues received by the EU as remuneration for the
guarantee under the EFSI Agreement, and amounts recovered by the EIB from defaulting debtors in
respect of previous guarantee calls. At the end of 2019 the assets of the EFSI guarantee fund totalled
EUR 6 688 million (2018: EUR 5 452 million), of which EUR 6 654 million was invested in available for
sale financial assets (2018: EUR 5 000 million), while another EUR 1 879 million (2018: EUR 2 688
million) have been committed but not yet paid into the fund and is included in the budgetary RAL and
also disclosed as outstanding commitments not yet expensed in note 5.1. The fund will be progressively
provisioned and will gradually reach EUR 9.1 billion, i.e. 35 % of the total EU EFSI guarantee obligations.

Guarantee Fund for external actions

The Guarantee Fund for external actions covers loans guaranteed by the EU budget, in particular EIB
lending operations outside the EU, financed from the EIB's own resources and loans under macro-
financial assistance (MFA) and Euratom loans outside the EU – see note 4.1.1. The fund is managed by
the EIB and it is intended to cover any defaulting loans guaranteed by the EU. The fund is endowed by
payments from the EU budget, the proceeds from interest on investments made from the fund's assets,
and amounts recovered from defaulting debtors for whom the fund has had to activate its guarantee. The
Guarantee Fund for external actions should be maintained at a target amount corresponding to 9 % of
the guaranteed loans outstanding at year-end. The difference between the target amount and the value
of the fund's assets at year-end will be covered from the EU budget in year N+2, while any surplus is
paid back to the EU budget.

EFSD Guarantee Fund

Pursuant to the EFSD Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2017/1601) the EFSD Guarantee Fund has been
established to provide a liquidity cushion to be used in the event of a call on the Union guarantee given
pursuant to the relevant EFSD guarantee agreements. The EFSD Guarantee Fund is financed by
contributions from the EU budget and from contributions from the 11th EDF to the EU budget, along with
voluntary contributions from Member States and other contributors. The fund is also endowed by returns
on invested resources, amounts recovered from defaulting debtors, revenues and any other payments
received by the EU in accordance with the EFSD guarantee agreements. Total payments received into the
guarantee fund as at 31 December 2019 amounted to EUR 600 million, of which EUR 595 million is
invested in available for sale financial assets, while another EUR 95 million (2018: 325 EUR million) has
been committed but not yet paid and is included in budgetary RAL and also disclosed as outstanding
commitments not yet expensed in note 5.1. The EFSD Guarantee Fund will be progressively provisioned

EU budget, and will be further increased by other contributions.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS FINANCED BY THE EU BUDGET

Horizon 2020

Under the EU Regulation establishing Horizon 2020 – the Framework Programme for Research and
Innovation (2014-2020), new financial instruments have been established in order to enhance access to
finance to entities engaged in research and innovation (R&I). These instruments are: the InnovFin Loan
and Guarantee Service for R&I under which the Commission shares the financial risk related to a portfolio
of new financing operations entered into by the EIB; the InnovFin SME Guarantee including the SME
Initiative Uncapped Guarantee Instrument (SIUGI) – guarantee facilities managed by the EIF providing
guarantees and counter-guarantees to the financial intermediaries for the new portfolios of loans (under
SIUGI the Commission shares the financial risk related to the guarantee given with Member States, EIF
and EIB); and the InnovFin Equity Facility for R&I providing for investments in venture capital funds
which is managed by the EIF.

Risk-Sharing Finance Facility

The Risk-Sharing Finance Facility (RSFF) is managed by the EIB and the Commission's investment
portfolio is used to provision financial risk for loans and guarantees given by the EIB to eligible research
projects. In total, an EU budget of up to EUR 1 billion was allocated to the RSFF under the 2007-2013
MFF. Under the 2014-2020 MFF, there are no new budget contributions foreseen for the RSFF. Given that
the significant portion of the RSFF outstanding operations has been already repaid, in 2019 the EIB
partially released the EU guarantee, which resulted in a decrease in the EU contingent liability as
disclosed in the note 4.1.3.

Connecting Europe Facility

Pursuant to Regulation (EU) No 2013/1316, the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) debt instrument has
been established with the objective to facilitate infrastructure projects’ access to financing in the sectors
of transport, telecommunications and energy. It is managed by the EIB under an agreement with the EU.
The CEF debt financial instrument is the continuity of the Loan Guarantee Instrument for TEN-T projects
(LGTT) and of the pilot phase of the Project Bond Initiative (PBI). It offers risk-sharing for debt financing
in the form of senior and subordinated debt or guarantee as well as support for project bonds. After
19 June 2019, with the effect of the first amendment of the delegation agreement with the EIB, all CEF
operations deployed by the EIB are assigned to one of the two portfolios: debt portfolio or non
securitisable financing portfolio, for which a new portfolio-based risk sharing approach is introduced.

EU SME Equity Facilities

These are equity instruments financed by the COSME, the CIP and MAP programmes and the Technology
Transfer Pilot Project, under the trusteeship of the EIF, supporting the creation and financing of EU SMEs
in their early (start-up) and growth stages by investing in suitable specialised venture capital funds.

The EU enters into foreign currency forward contracts in order to hedge the foreign currency risk related
to USD denominated debt securities held in the EFSI Guarantee Fund. Under the foreign currency forward
contracts, the EU delivers the contractually agreed notional amount in foreign currency ('pay leg'), as
presented in the table above, and will receive the notional amount in EUR ('receive leg') at the maturity

date. Such derivative contracts are measured at fair value at the balance sheet date and classified as
either financial assets or financial liabilities at fair value through surplus or deficit depending on whether
their fair value is positive or negative.

The heading Guarantee on equity portfolio comprises guarantees given by the EU to financial institutions
on portfolios of equity investments that are classified as derivative financial instruments and accounted
for as a financial asset or financial liability at fair value through surplus or deficit. The total amount
represents mainly the EFSI guarantee given by the EU to the EIB Group with underlying equity
investments disbursed by the EIB and EIF amounting to EUR 1 420 million (2018: EUR 674 million). The
fair value of the EU guarantee on the EFSI equity portfolios totalled EUR 134 million (2018:
EUR 14 million).

The nominal value of loans for financial assistance at 31 December 2019 totals EUR 51 941 million (2018:
EUR 53 206 million). The change in carrying amount corresponds to the change in accrued interests.
EFSM enables the granting of financial assistance to a Member State in difficulties, or seriously
threatened by severe difficulties caused by exceptional circumstances beyond its control. The assistance
may take the form of a loan or credit line. The ECOFIN Council conclusions of 9 May 2010 restrict the
facility to EUR 60 billion but the legal limit restricts the outstanding amount of loans or credit lines to the
margin available under the own resources ceiling. Borrowings related to loans disbursed under the EFSM
are guaranteed by the EU budget. It is not foreseen that the EFSM will engage in new financing
programmes or enter into new loan facility agreements.
The BOP facility, a policy-based financial instrument, provides medium-term financial assistance to
Member States of the EU that have not adopted the Euro. It enables the granting of loans to Member
States who are experiencing, or are seriously threatened by, difficulties in their balance of payments or
capital movements. The maximum outstanding amount of loans granted under the instrument is limited
to EUR 50 billion. Borrowings related to these BOP loans are guaranteed by the EU budget. During 2019,
Romania repaid the remaining EUR 1 billion of its outstanding loan amount and Latvia repaid EUR 500
million of its EUR 700 million outstanding amount.
MFA is a form of financial aid extended by the EU to partner countries experiencing a balance of payment
crisis. It takes the form of medium/long term loans or grants or an appropriate combination of both and
generally complements financing provided in the context of an IMF-supported adjustment and reform
program. These loans are guaranteed by the Guarantee Fund for external actions. During the year ended
31 December 2019, further disbursements of loans under MFA for a total amount of EUR 420 million were
provided, being EUR 300 million to Tunisia, EUR 100 million to Jordan and EUR 20 million to Moldova –
see also note 4.1.2.
The European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom, represented by the Commission) lends money to
both Member States and non-Member States, and to entities of both, to finance projects relating to
energy installations. Guarantees from third parties of EUR 214 million (2018: EUR 254 million) have been
received to cover Euratom loans – see note 4.1.2.

ECSC in Liquidation loans are not loans for financial assistance but promissory notes in order to keep the
cash flows in parallel with the borrowings. However, similar to the loans for financial assistance, they
were granted on borrowed funds in accordance with articles 54 and 56 of the ECSC Treaty for project
financing. The last promissory notes were fully reimbursed in 2019.

Subrogated loans are defaulted loans which were granted by the EIB and guaranteed by the EU budget,
for which all rights have been subrogated to the EU following the payment from the Guarantee Fund for
external actions or from the EFSI Guarantee Fund. These loans are fully impaired for an amount of
EUR 658 million (2018: EUR 579 million). Guarantee calls are partially covered by financial provisions
made in previous years. Under the relevant agreements between the EU and the EIB, recovery
proceedings are undertaken by the EIB on behalf of the EU with the aim to recover any sums due.

The level of pre-financing in the various programmes must be sufficient to ensure the necessary funding
for the beneficiary to initiate and advance the project, while also safeguarding the financial interests of
the EU and taking into consideration legal, operational and cost-effectiveness constraints.

Pre-financing represents money paid out, and thus the implementation of payment appropriations. As
explained in note 1.5.7, these are advances and so not yet expensed. Thus while pre-financing reduces
outstanding RAL (see note 5.1) it represents expenses still to be accepted and recognised in the
statement of financial performance.

For shared management, almost all pre-financing relates to the current programming period. There is an
initial pre-financing which will not be cleared (i.e. recognised in the statement of financial performance)
before the end of the programming period and is shown as a non-current pre-financing. There is also an
annual pre-financing which is cleared on an annual basis and is shown as a current pre-financing.
EUR 10.5 billion of new pre-financing has been paid in 2019. The shared management pre-financing is
stable compared to 2018 except for a decrease in the EAFRD which relates to the remaining pre-financing
of the previous programming period. This has been cleared during the year.

For direct management, the biggest part of pre-financing concerns Research (mainly Horizon 2020,
implemented by the Commission and EU executive agencies) and amounts to EUR 7.8 billion (2018:
EUR 6.8 billion). The increase is a consequence of the agreements entered into during 2019, for which
pre-financing payments were made.

For indirect management, the pre-financing covers mainly internal policies programmes like Erasmus,
Galileo and EGNOS, but also instruments related to external relations like ENI (European Neighbourhood
Instrument), DCI (Development Cooperation Instrument) and IPA (Instrument for Pre-Accession). The
increase in pre-financing to international organisations concerns mainly the above mentioned external
relations instruments. The increase in pre-financing to other entities mainly concerns the Erasmus
program implemented by national agencies with new agreements starting in 2019.

Guarantees received in respect of pre-financing

These are guarantees that the Commission requests in certain cases from beneficiaries that are not
Member States, when paying out advance payments (pre-financing). There are two values to disclose for
this type of guarantee, the ‘nominal’ and the ‘on-going’ values. For the nominal value, the generating
event is linked to the existence of the guarantee. For the on-going value, the guarantee’s generating
event is the pre-financing payment made against the guarantee, then reduced by subsequent clearings.

-----------------------Page 47 End-----------------------

                                 Annual accounts of the European Union 2019

At 31 December 2019 the nominal value of guarantees received in respect of pre-financing amounted to
EUR 492 million while the on-going value of those guarantees was EUR 406 million (2018: EUR 516
million and EUR 420 million respectively).

Certain pre-financing amounts paid out under the 7th Research Framework Programme for research and
technological development (FP7) and under Horizon 2020 are effectively covered by a Participants
Guarantee Fund (PGF). The PGF is a mutual benefit instrument set up to cover the risks relating to non-
payment of amounts by the beneficiaries during the implementation of the indirect actions of FP7 and
Horizon 2020. All participants of indirect actions receiving a grant from the EU contribute 5 % of the total
amount received to the PGF's capital.

At 31 December 2019, pre-financing amounts covered by the PGF totalled EUR 2.1 billion (2018: EUR 2
billion). The EU (represented by the Commission) acts as an executive agent of the participants of the
PGF, but the fund is owned by the participants.

At year-end, the PGF had total assets of EUR 2.2 billion (2018: EUR 2.1 billion). The assets of the PGF
also include financial assets that are managed by the Commission. As the PGF is a separate entity the
assets of the fund are not consolidated in these EU annual accounts.

Advances to Member States for financial instruments under shared management

Under the framework of the European Structural and Investment Funds (ESIF) programmes, it is possible
to make advance payments from the EU budget to Member States so as to allow them to contribute to
financial instruments (i.e. loans, equity investments or guarantees). These financial instruments are set
up and managed under the responsibility of the Member States, not the Commission. Nevertheless,
monies that are unused by these instruments at year-end are the property of the EU (as with all pre-
financing) and are thus treated as an asset on the EU’s balance sheet.

2014-2020 Period:

Under cohesion policy, out of EUR 7 146 million paid, it is estimated that EUR 3 247 million were unused
at 31 December 2019. This includes the contribution of the Member States to the SME Initiative, an
instrument aimed at stimulating additional lending by the banking sector to SMEs (EUR 1 198 million paid
excluding amounts still in pre-financing, out of which EUR 324 million is estimated as unused).

For rural development, EUR 54 million remained unused at year-end.

2007-2013 Period:

All amounts related to the cohesion policy are considered to have been either implemented or re-
allocated to other measures, therefore no assets remain on the balance sheet at 31 December 2019. It
should be noted that the actual implementation by the various instruments will be reviewed as part of the
closure process of the programmes in the coming years.

Aid Schemes

Similar to the above, advances paid by the Member States for various aid schemes (state aid, market
measures of EAGF or investment measures of EAFRD) that were not used at year-end are recorded as
assets (advances) on the EU's balance sheet. The Commission has estimated the value of these advances
based on information provided by the Member States; the resulting amounts are included under the Aid
Schemes sub-heading above.

                                Annual accounts of the European Union 2019

2014-2020 Period:

The unused amounts at year-end were estimated at EUR 2 044 million for cohesion policy and
EUR 1 460 million for agriculture and rural development.

2007-2013 Period:

It is estimated that EUR 130 million paid in the context of rural development remains unused at the end
of 2019.

The largest amount included under non-current relates to amounts due from Member States, and the
large increase concerns the United Kingdom (UK) infringement case (explained below) – in the previous
year this amount, EUR 2.1 billion, had been shown under current. Also included as non-current, as in
previous years, are amounts relating to non-executed conformity clearance decisions for the European
Agricultural Guarantee Fund (EAGF) as well as for the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development
(EAFRD). The amounts related to these decisions are being recovered in annual instalments.

The above mentioned move from current to non-current also explains the large decrease in current
amounts due from Member States. The decrease is also due to there being no own resources to be
received linked to an amending budget in 2019 as compared to 2018 – see below.

Own resources recoverables

'A accounts' refers to the monthly statements where the Member States communicate the established
Traditional Own Resources (TOR) entitlements to the Commission, not yet recovered. TOR are composed
of customs duties and sugar levies, collected by Member States on behalf of the Commission.

The ‘A accounts’ have tended to have a level of approximately EUR 3 billion at year-end, however, in both
2018 and 2019 the balance includes additional TOR amounts related to the UK infringement case
(explained below) and other TOR inspection reports. As late payment interest of EUR 1.2 billion is
applicable (2018: EUR 1.3 billion), those amounts are therefore also reported in these annual accounts
(see notes 2.6.2 and 3.7).

Concerning the infringement case, on 8 March 2018, the Commission sent a letter of formal notice
(Infringement No 2018/2008) to the UK because it failed to make the correct amount of traditional own
resources available to the EU budget, as required by EU law. As the UK did not provide a satisfactory
reply, neither to the letter of formal notice nor to the reasoned opinion sent on 24 September 2018, the
Commission confirmed on 6 March 2019 its decision to refer the infringement to the Court of Justice of
the EU and lodged its application on 7 March 2019. The case originated in a 2017 OLAF report, that found
that importers in the UK evaded a large amount of customs duties by using fictitious and false invoices
and incorrect customs value declarations at importation. Based on a methodology developed by OLAF and
JRC and on the information available, the Commission estimates that the infringement of EU legislation
by the UK resulted, during the period November 2011 to October 2017, in losses to the EU budget
amounting to EUR 2.1 billion (net, i.e. after deducting the collection costs to be retained by the UK from
the gross amount of EUR 2.7 billion). The UK does not agree with the methodology used by the
Commission to estimate the above losses. The ongoing Court proceedings and the information available
to date are indicative of a long-term process. Therefore, both the principal of EUR 2.1 billion and the
estimated late payment interest of EUR 1.1 billion accrued until end 2019 (compared to EUR 0.7 billion
interest accrued and recognised until end 2018) have been classified as long-term assets.

                                  Annual accounts of the European Union 2019

In addition, the Commission included in the accounts a receivable of EUR 0.2 billion for established
customs duties and late payment interest which is based on the latest available information. The amount
of EUR 0.7 billion initially recognised in 2018 has been adjusted downwards following new information
that the UK authorities provided in 2019 (see notes 2.6.2 and 3.7).

‘Separate accounts’ refers to established entitlements that have not been included in the 'A accounts',
because they have not been recovered by Member States and no security has been provided (or if
security has been provided but the amounts are contested). These entitlements are subject to
impairment based on information provided every year by the Member States. These amounts are
generally at a similar level at each year-end, as seen above.

‘Own resources to be received’ in 2018 refer to recoverables as a result of the amending budget No
6/2018 adopted on 12 December 2018. The amounts were entered by Member States on the first
working day of January 2019. There is no such amount relating to 2019.

EAGF and Rural Development recoverables

This item primarily covers the amounts owed by Member States at 31 December 2019, as declared and
certified by the Member States as at 15 October 2019. An estimation is made for the recoverables arising
after this declaration and up to 31 December 2019. The Commission also estimates a write-down for the
amounts owed by beneficiaries that are unlikely to be recovered. The fact that such an adjustment is
made does not mean that the Commission is waiving future recovery of these amounts. A deduction of
20 % is also included in the adjustment and corresponds to what Member States are allowed to retain to
cover administrative costs.

The provisional payments mainly relate to cash receipts from companies that have nevertheless initiated
an appeal or still have the option to appeal against the fine decisions at EU courts. A contingent liability is
disclosed for the possibility of having to pay back these amounts to the fined companies (see note
4.1.4).

Fined companies who have launched or are planning to launch an appeal have an option to either make
provisional payments or to provide bank guarantees to the Commission. For EUR 11 133 million (2018:
EUR 9 354 million) of fines not paid at year-end, the Commission has accepted financial guarantees.

The amounts written down due to impairment reflect the Commission's case-by-case assessment of fines
amounts not cashed or not covered with a guarantee, which the Commission expects not to recover.

The increase in recoverables from competition fines is mainly due to one significant fine
(EUR 1 494 million) where the company concerned covered the fine with a bank guarantee accepted by
the Commission. The remaining increase due to other competition fines raised in the year
(EUR 2 597 million) was largely offset by fines which were definitively cashed in 2019 (see note 2.8.1).

Accrued income includes EUR 1.4 billion (2018: EUR 1.1 billion) that the Commission expects to recover
from the Member States in the area of cohesion. The recovery will be made as a result of the
examination and acceptance of the annual accounts submitted by the Member States in early 2020. This
procedure for the acceptance of Member States' annual accounts was introduced in the cohesion area for
the programming period 2014-2020.

The non-current late payment interest concerns the infringement case mentioned in note 2.6.1.1. In
2018 this interest had been shown under current.

The other current receivables mainly relate to late payment interests. The decrease in 2019 is primarily
due to the classification as non-current of the interest relating to the infringment case and the
downwards adjustment of TOR inspection reports (see note 2.6.1.1).

2.8.1.     Bank accounts for budget implementation

This heading covers the funds which the Commission keeps in its bank accounts in each Member State
and EFTA country (treasury or central bank), as well as in commercial bank current accounts, imprest
accounts and petty cash accounts. The treasury balance at the end of 2019 is driven by the following
main elements:

    •    An amount of EUR 2.6 billion of fines, imposed by the Commission for breach of competition
         rules, definitively cashed in 2019 and not yet included in an amending budget, is included in the
         year-end treasury balance.

    •    The treasury balance also includes not yet used assigned revenue and other payment
         appropriations of EUR 9.7 billion of the 2019 budget.


2.8.2.     Cash belonging to financial instruments

Amounts shown under this heading primarily concern cash equivalents managed by fiduciaries, on behalf
of the Commission, for the purpose of implementing particular financial instrument programmes funded
by the EU budget and cash and cash equivalents held in the guarantee funds relating to budgetary
guarantees (see note 2.4.1). The cash belonging to financial instruments and guarantee funds can only
be used in the programmes concerned.


2.8.3.     Cash relating to fines

This is cash received in connection with fines issued by the Commission for which the case is still open.
These amounts are kept in specific deposit accounts that are not used for any other activities. Where an
appeal has been lodged or when it is unknown if an appeal will be made by the other party, the
underlying amount is shown as contingent liability in note 4.1.4.

Since 2010, all subsequent provisionally cashed fines are managed by the Commission in the BUFI fund
and invested in financial instruments categorised as available for sale (see note 2.4.1).

The increase in the total employee benefits liability is primarily driven by the increase in the net liability
of the Pension Scheme of European Officials (PSEO), the largest scheme in place. This PSEO liability has
increased mainly because of the actuarial loss from changes in financial assumptions caused by a sharp
decrease in the nominal discount rate. Furthermore, as the nominal discount rate is adjusted for inflation
to obtain the real discount rate, this year the real discount rate was for the first time negative – meaning
that any given amount is worth more today than in the future: this significantly increases the size of the
liability at year-end (see note 2.9.3). The lower discount rate has had a similar effect on the other
smaller schemes.

Additionally, the rights accrued during the year due to service are higher than the benefits paid out
during the year. There is also an increase due to the annual interest cost (unwinding of the liability
discounting) as well as actuarial losses from experience.


2.9.1.    Pension Scheme of European Officials

This defined benefit obligation represents the present value of expected future payments that the EU is
required to make so as to settle the pension obligations resulting from employee service in the current
and prior periods. The scheme is ongoing, and as such, all payments required to be made from the
scheme on an annual basis are included in the EU budget each year.

In accordance with Article 83 of the Staff Regulations, the payment of the benefits provided for in the
staff pension scheme constitutes a charge to the EU's budget. The scheme is notionally funded, and the
Member States guarantee the payment of these benefits collectively. A compulsory pension contribution
is deducted from the basic salaries of active members, currently 9.7 %. These contributions are treated
as budget revenue of the year and contribute to the funding of EU expenditure in general, see also note
3.6.

The liabilities of the pension scheme were assessed on the basis of the number of PSEO staff (active
staff, retirees, former active staff now on invalidity and dependants of deceased staff) at 31 December
2019 and on the rules of the Staff Regulations applicable at this date. This valuation was carried out in
accordance with the methodology of IPSAS 39 (and therefore also EU accounting rule 12).


2.9.2.    Other retirement benefit schemes

This refers to the liability relating to the pension obligations towards Members and former Members of the
Commission, the Court of Justice (and General Court) and the Court of Auditors, the Council, the
Ombudsman, the European Data Protection Supervisor, and the European Union Civil Service Tribunal.
Also included under this heading is a liability relating to the pensions of Members of the European
Parliament.

2.9.3.    Joint Sickness Insurance Scheme

In addition to the above retirement benefit schemes, a valuation is made for the estimated liability that
the EU has regarding the Joint Sickness Insurance Scheme (JSIS) in relation to healthcare costs which
must be paid during post-activity periods (net of their contributions). As stated in note 1.5.10, the
calculation of this liability takes account of the full active service period, ensuring that both the pension
and the sickness insurance schemes of the staff’s post-employment plan are accounted for consistently.
Taking into account the obligation to faithfully present the economic substance of the underlying situation
as required by both EAR and IPSAS, we have not interpreted IPSAS 39 in a stricter sense when
attributing the benefits to the periods of service. If one were to accrue the service cost for the JSIS
scheme fully over 10 years for all officials, as opposed to the period of active service of the employee,
the impact of such an approach on the defined benefit obligation at year-end would be an increase of
EUR 4.3 billion. However, as already indicated, this stricter approach would not be compatible with the
qualitative characteristic of faithful representation, and thus would not be deemed to provide reliable
information in accordance with EAR 1 and the IPSAS Conceptual Framework. This estimate is highly
sensitive to the evolution of current staff administrative status (in particular the number of fixed-term
contract members assumed to become officials in the future).

Movement in present value of employee benefits defined benefit obligation

The present value of the defined benefit obligation is the discounted expected future payments required
to settle the obligation resulting from employee service in the current and prior periods.

An analysis of the current year movement in the defined benefit obligation is presented below:

Current service cost is the increase in the present value of the defined benefit obligation arising from
current members' service in the current year.

Interest cost refers to the increase during the period in the present value of the defined benefit obligation
because the benefits are one period closer to settlement.

Actuarial gains and losses from experience refer to the effects of differences between what was expected
according to the assumptions made last year for 2019 and what really occurred in 2019.

Actuarial gains and losses from actuarial assumptions (demographic variables such as employee turnover
and mortality and financial variables such as discount rates and expected salary increases) arise where
these assumptions are updated in order to reflect changes in underlying conditions.

Benefits (for example, pensions or medical cost reimbursements) are paid during the year according to
the rules of the scheme. These benefits paid lead to a decrease in the defined benefit obligation.

Mortality rates for 2018 and 2019 are based on the EU Civil Servants Life Table - EULT 2018.

The nominal discount rate is determined as the value of the Euro zero-coupon yield (with a maturity of 22
years as of December 2019 for the PSEO, and 26 years for the Joint Sickness Insurance Scheme). The
inflation rate used is the expected inflation rate over the equivalent period. It must be determined
empirically, based on prospective values as expressed by index-linked bonds on the European financial
markets. The real discount rate is calculated from the nominal discount rate and the expected long-term
inflation rate.

A decrease in the real discount rate, i.e. the difference between the nominal discount rate and the
expected inflation rate, has been observed over the past few years but it was particularly steep in 2019.
The decrease in the real discount rate is mainly due to the decline in the nominal discount rate, which is
in line with the trend observed globally on the financial markets. With the expected inflation rate having
fallen only slightly, the decline in the nominal discount rate was not counterbalanced and translated to
the significant decrease in the real discount rate, thus becoming negative for the first time and
contributing to the significant actuarial loss from financial assumptions.

Sensitivity analyses

The sensitivity analysis is based on simulations which change, everything else being equal, the value of
the concerned assumptions and observing how the model reacts.

Provisions are reliably estimated amounts, arising from past events, that will probably have to be paid by
the EU budget in the future.

Legal cases

This is the estimate of amounts that will probably have to be paid out after the year-end in relation to a
number of on-going legal cases. The Agriculture amounts relate to legal actions of Member States against
conformity clearance decisions for the EAGF.

Nuclear site dismantlement

As of 2017 the basis for the provision was updated as per the ‘JRC Decommissioning & Waste
Management Programme Strategy (D&WMP) – Updated in 2017’. The review of the strategy, along with
budget and staff needs, was conducted together with the independent D&WMP Expert Group. It
represents the best available estimate of the budget and staff needed to complete the decommissioning
of the JRC sites of Ispra, Geel, Karlsruhe and Petten.

In accordance with the EU accounting rules, this provision is indexed for inflation and then discounted to
its net present value (using the Euro swap curve). At 31 December 2019, this resulted in a provision of
EUR 2 132 million, split between amounts expected to be used in 2020 (EUR 31 million) and afterwards
(EUR 2 101 million). The increase compared to 2018 is mainly the result of the decreasing discount rate
applied to the estimated future costs.

It must be noted that major uncertainties, inherent to the long term planning of nuclear
decommissioning, could affect this estimate, which could significantly increase in the future. The main
sources of uncertainty are related to the end state of the decommissioned site, nuclear materials, waste
management and disposal aspects, incomplete or lacking definition of national regulatory frames,
complicated and time-consuming licensing processes and future developments of the decommissioning
industrial market.

Financial provisions

These concern mainly provisions, which represent the estimated losses that will be incurred in relation to
the guarantees given under different financial instruments, where entrusted entities are empowered to
issue guarantees in their own name but on behalf of and at the risk of the EU. The financial risk of the EU
linked to the guarantees is capped and financial assets are gradually provisioned to cover for the future
guarantee calls. This heading also includes provisions for outstanding loans to Syria issued by the EIB
under its external lending mandate and thus guaranteed by the EU via the Guarantee Fund for external
actions. Non-current financial provisions are discounted to their net present value.

The increase of the financial provision relates to the increase of the volume of guaranteed operations
under H2020 and COSME financial instruments.

Borrowings mainly include debts evidenced by certificates amounting to EUR 52 433 million (2018:
EUR 53 725 million). The changes in carrying amount correspond to the change in accrued interests.

The repayment of the above borrowings are ultimately guaranteed by the EU budget – see note 4.1.2,
and by extension by each Member State.

Guarantee on equity portfolio

Guarantees given on equity portfolio are classified as financial liabilities at fair value through surplus or
deficit since they do not meet the definition of a financial guarantee liability – see note 1.5.12.
As at 31 December 2019 this heading relates mainly to a guarantee provided by the EU under the H2020
financial instruments (see note 2.4.1) to the EIB Group for portfolios of equity operations. The EU
financial liability is measured based on the value of the underlying investments.

Foreign exchange option

As at 31 December 2019 the EU holds a derivative financial instrument (Foreign exchange option – put
spread type of option) in which it covers the devaluation of the foreign exchange currency (UHA) related
to loans given by financial institutions to SMEs in Ukraine so as to enhance the access to financing, as
well as the attractiveness of the loan conditions in Ukraine. Under the terms of the contract, the EU
provides its partners with an option to call, for each eligible loan, up to a maximum of 30 %, for an EU
contribution in the case of devaluation of the ratio UHA/EUR.

2.11.3. Financial guarantee liabilities

The EFSI guarantee on the debt portfolio disbursed by the EIB under the EFSI Innovation and
Infrastructure window (IIW), as well as the External Lending Mandate (ELM) guarantee for the EIB loans
disbursed under the EIB Resilience Initiative (ERI) are classified as a financial guarantee liability.
At 31 December 2019, the EFSI financial guarantee liability totals EUR zero (2018: EUR zero), as the
revenues to be received under this guarantee exceed expected losses, while the ELM ERI financial
guarantee liability amounts to EUR 20 million (see note 4.1.1).

Payables include invoices and cost claims received but not yet paid at year-end. They are initially
recognised at the time of the reception of the invoices / cost claims for the requested amounts. The
payables are subsequently adjusted to reflect only the amounts accepted following review of costs, and
the amounts estimated to be eligible. The amounts estimated to be non-eligible are included in the
column ‘Adjustments’; the largest amounts concern the structural actions.

In the 2014-2020 programming period, the Common Provisions Regulation (CPR) applicable to the
Structural Funds (ERDF and ESF), Cohesion Fund and to the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund
(EMFF) foresees that the EU budget is protected by means of a systematic retention of 10 % of the
interim payments made. By February following the end of the CPR accounting year (1 July - 30 June), the
control cycle is complete both through management verifications by the managing authorities and audits
by the audit authorities. The Commission examines the assurance documents and the accounts provided
by the relevant authorities in the Member States. The payment / recovery of the final balance is made
only after this assessment is finalised and the accounts are accepted. The amount retained according to
this provision at end 2019 totalled EUR 7.6 billion. A part of this amount (EUR 2 billion) is estimated as
being non-eligible on the basis of the information provided by the Member States in their accounts and is
also included in the column ‘Adjustments’. The final component of the adjustments to the payables is
represented by the amounts corresponding to other advances to Member States (see note 2.5.2) still to
be paid at year-end (EUR 0.5 billion).

Payables concerning cohesion policy (ERDF, CF, ESF) have decreased. The claims related to the period
2007-2013 have further decreased to EUR 1.9 billion (2018: EUR 3.5 billion), as the Commission has
validated and paid the final cost claims submitted by the Member States for this period. At the same
time, claims related to period 2014-2020 decreased to EUR 5.8 billion (2018: EUR 10 billion) as fewer
cost claims were received for payment at 31 December compared to last year. The implementation of the
programmes is however progressing (see ERDF, CF expenses note 3.9) as evidenced by the fact that the
overall liabilities for ERDF, CF are stable – see increase in accrued charges note 2.13.

The increase in EAGF payables relates to the repartition of the total EAGF liabilities between payables and
accrued charges. The total EAGF liabilities remain stable at EUR 44 448 million against EUR 44 159
million last year. However, in 2019 the amounts already claimed by the Member States at the end of the
year (accounted for as payable) are higher than in 2018.

Requests for pre-financing

In addition to the above amounts, at the end of 2019, EUR 0.5 billion of requests for pre-financing have
been received and were not yet paid at year-end. According to the EU accounting rules, these amounts
are not booked as payables.

Own Resources Payables
Own resources payables refer to Member States EU budget contributions to be reimbursed at year-end.
Amending budgets are implemented according to Article 10(3) of Regulation no 609/2014. The amount
on 31 December 2018 was due to the adoption of the amending budget No 6/2018 adopted on 12
December 2018. According to this legal provision, the resulting amounts were returned to the Member
States on the first working day of January 2019. This year there was no similar amending budget, thus
no such payables.


2.13. ACCRUED CHARGES AND DEFERRED INCOME

                                                                                               EUR million

Accrued charges refer to recognised expenses for which the Commission has still to receive cost claims.
For cohesion policy, the increase for ERDF & CF accrued charges (as the programmes are being further
implemented) offsets the decrease in payables, thus resulting in a stable amount of the overall liability
towards the Member States (EUR 15 156 million, compared to EUR 14 900 million in the previous year).
For ESF, the total liability has decreased to EUR 5 341 million (2018: EUR 7 020 million) following the
trend in the ESF expenses. For the decrease in EAGF see note 2.12 above.

Total amounts to be called from Member States at 31.12.2019                                       77 560


This amount represents that part of the expenses incurred by the EU up to 31 December that must be
funded by future budgets. Many expenses are recognised under accrual accounting rules in the year N
although they may be actually paid in year N+1 (or later) and therefore funded using the budget of year
N+1 (or later). The inclusion in the accounts of these liabilities coupled with the fact that the
corresponding amounts are financed from future budgets, results in liabilities greatly exceeding assets at
the year-end. The most significant amounts to be highlighted concern the EAGF activities and employee
benefit liabilities.

It should also be noted that the above has no effect on the budget result – budget revenue should always
equal or exceed budget expenditure and any excess of revenue is returned to Member States.

The remeasurements in employee benefits liabilities relate to actuarial gains and losses arising from the
actuarial valuation of these liabilities. As from 1 January 2018 the amended EU accounting rule 12 (based
on IPSAS 39) for employee benefits is applicable. According to this rule actuarial gains and losses are
presented as a movement in net assets rather than in the statement of financial performance.

          PERFORMANCE

REVENUE FROM NON-EXCHANGE TRANSACTIONS:
OWN RESOURCES

3.1.      GNI RESOURCES

Own resources revenue is the primary element of the EU's operational revenue. GNI (gross national
income) revenue amounts to EUR 108 820 million for 2019 (2018: EUR 105 780 million) and is the most
significant of the three categories of own resources. A uniform percentage is levied on the GNI of each
Member State. The GNI revenue balances revenue and expenditure i.e. funds the part of the budget that
is not covered by other sources of income. The increase of GNI revenue is explained mainly by the size of
adjustments for the past (mostly years 2012 to 2017). Every year, the GNI bases are updated with real
data and the contributions of Member States to the EU budget are recalculated in line with their updated
economic performance. This procedure is key to ensuring a level playing field among Member States in
terms of their annual contributions.


3.2.      TRADITIONAL OWN RESOURCES

                                                                                                 EUR million
                                                                                   2019               2018
Customs duties                                                                   21 235              22 763
Sugar levies                                                                          0                   4
Total                                                                           21 235              22 767

Traditional own resources comprise custom duties and sugar levies. Member States retain, by way of
collection costs, 20 % of traditional own resources, and the above amounts are shown net of this
deduction. The decrease in customs duties largely refers to the absence of the infringement case revenue
recognised in 2018. (see note 2.6.1.1).


3.3.      VAT RESOURCES

The VAT resource is defined as the Union’s second kind of own resources since this tax type was the first
to be largely harmonised at the EU level. The VAT contribution is calculated by applying a uniform call
rate of 0.3 % to the national VAT base which cannot exceed 50 % of the gross national income (GNI) of
each Member State. For the period 2014-2020, the Council Decision 2014/335/EU, Euratom, foresees a
reduced rate of call of 0.15 % for Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden.


REVENUE FROM NON-EXCHANGE TRANSACTIONS:
TRANSFERS

3.4.      FINES

Revenue of EUR 4 291 million (2018: EUR 6 740 million) relates to fines the Commission has imposed on
companies for breaches of EU competition rules and fines the Commission has imposed on Member
States for infringements of EU law. The Commission recognises revenue from fines when it adopts the
decision to impose a fine and it officially notifies the addressee. The amounts relate mainly to competition
fines (EUR 4 091 million). The biggest cases concern breaches of EU antitrust rules, i.e. a fine imposed on
Google for abusive practices in online advertising (EUR 1 494 million), fines imposed on five banks in two
Forex cases for participating in foreign exchange spot trading cartels (in total EUR 1 068 million) and a

fine imposed on Mastercard for obstructing merchants' access to cross-border card payment services
(EUR 570 million).


3.5.     RECOVERY OF EXPENSES

                                                                             2019                  2018

Indirect management                                                             16                    34

This heading mainly represents the recovery orders issued by the Commission that are cashed or offset
against (i.e. deducted from) subsequent payments recorded in the Commission's accounting system,
issued so as to recover expenditure previously paid out from the EU budget. Recoveries are based on
controls, audits or eligibility analysis and therefore, these operations protect the EU budget from
expenditure incurred in breach of law.

Recovery orders issued by Member States to beneficiaries of EAGF expenditure, as well as the variation of
accrued income estimations from the previous year-end to the current year-end, are also included.

The amounts included in the above table represent revenue earned through the issuance of recovery
orders. For this reason, these figures cannot and do not show the full extent of the measures taken to
protect the EU budget, particularly for cohesion policy where specific mechanisms are in place to ensure
the correction of ineligible expenditure, most of which do not involve the issuance of a recovery order.
Not included are amounts recovered through offsetting with expenses, amounts recovered by way of
withdrawals and recoveries of pre-financing amounts.

Shared management recoveries make up the bulk of the total:

Agriculture: EAGF and rural development

In the framework of the EAGF and the EAFRD, amounts accounted for as revenue of the year under this
heading are financial corrections of the year and reimbursements declared by Member States and
recovered during the year, as well as the net increase in the outstanding amounts declared by Member
States to be recovered at year-end concerning fraud and irregularities.

Cohesion policy

The main amounts related to cohesion policy relate to accrued income of EUR 1.4 billion (2018: EUR 1.1
billion) that the Commission expects to recover from the Member States. The recovery will be made as a
result of the examination and acceptance of the annual accounts submitted by the Member States in
early 2020. This procedure for the acceptance of Member States' annual accounts in the cohesion area
started with the programming period 2014-2020.

Contributions from third countries are contributions from EFTA countries and pre-accession countries.

Staff taxes and contributions revenue relates primarily to the deductions from staff salaries. Retirement
contributions and income tax represent the substantial amounts within the category.

Contributions from Member States for external aid are mainly the amounts received to set up the Facility
for Refugees in Turkey.

Transfer of assets revenue relates mainly to the transfer of satellites under the Copernicus programme
from the European Space Agency (ESA) to the Commission (see note 2.2). This transfer is a non-
exchange transaction according to the EU accounting rules and will occur in future periods for the
remaining Copernicus satellites currently under construction.

The budgetary adjustments resulted in a negative amount as the positive effect from taking in the budget
surplus from the previous year of EUR 1 803 million (2018: EUR 555 million) was overcompensated by
GNI/VAT adjustments of EUR 3 443 million (2018: EUR 1 292 million).

Other revenue from non-exchange transactions includes EUR 151 million of Member State contributions
to Fusion for Energy, the European Joint Undertdaking for ITER and the Development of Fusion Energy.

The late payment interest of 2018 included a large initial interest revenue on late payments in relation to
the UK infringement case and the TOR inspection reports (see note 2.6.1.1). This year additional
revenue has been recognised for the infringement case as well as a downwards adjustment of interest
concerning TOR inspection reports (see note 2.6.1.1).

The increase mainly concerns cohesion policy (ERDF, CF) where almost all expenses relate to the current
programming period, where the work continues to advance.

Other expenses mainly include: Asylum and Migration (EUR 0.6 billion), Fund for European Aid to the
Most Deprived (EUR 0.5 billion), Internal Security (EUR 0.4 billion), European Union Solidarity Fund
(EUR 0.4 billion) and European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EUR 0.7 billion). The decrease compared to
last year mainly relates to the European Union Solidarity Fund.

The increase in direct management expenses implemented by EU Executive agencies refers mainly
(EUR 0.8 billion) to the Innovation and Networks Executive Agency (INEA) out of which the biggest part
relates to the transport part of the CEF. The CEF for transport is the funding instrument to implement
European transport infrastructure policy and aims in building new or upgrading/rehabilitating transport
infrastructure in Europe.

In indirect management expenses, EUR 4.2 billion relates to external actions (mainly the areas of
pre-accession, humanitarian aid, international co-operation and neighbourhood). A further EUR 5.8 billion
is related to increasing Europe's competitiveness (in areas such as research, satellite navigation systems
and education). The decrease in expenses implemented by other entities mainly relates to education
(Erasmus).

the employee benefits liabilities other than actuarial assumptions. They do not therefore represent actual
pension payments of the year, which are significantly lower.

4.        CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND ASSETS

4.1.      CONTINGENT LIABILITIES

Contingent liabilities are possible future payment obligations for the EU that may arise due to past events
or legally binding commitments taken but which will depend on future events not wholly under the
control of the EU. They relate mainly to financial guarantees given (on loans and financial assistance
programmes) and to legal risks. All contingent liabilities, except those relating to fines and guarantees
covered by funds (see note 2.4.1), would be financed, should they fall due, by the EU budget (and thus
the EU Member States) in the years to come.


4.1.1.    Budgetary guarantees


                                                                                                     EUR million

The above table shows the extent of the exposure of the EU budget to possible future payments linked to
guarantees given to the EIB group or other financial institutions. Disbursed amounts represent the
amounts already given to final beneficiaries, while signed amounts include these disbursed monies plus
agreements already signed with beneficiaries or financial intermediaries but not yet disbursed
(EUR 15 762 million). The ceiling represents the total guarantee that the EU budget, and thus its Member
States, have committed to cover, since in order to disclose the maximum exposure faced by the EU at
31 December 2019, one must also include operations authorised to be signed but not yet signed
(EUR 10 365 million). The amounts are presented net of financial provisions or financial liabilities
recognised for those programmes.

EIB external lending mandate guarantees

The EU budget guarantees loans signed and granted by the EIB from the EIB's own resources to third
countries. At 31 December 2019 the amount of loans outstanding and covered by the EU guarantee
totalled EUR 20 014 million (2018: 20 510 million). The EU budget guarantees:

     •   EUR 19 074 million (2018: EUR 19 360 million) via the Guarantee Fund for external actions (see
         note 2.4.1), and

     •   EUR 940 million (2018: EUR 1 150 million) directly for loans granted to Member States before
         accession.

In addition to the EUR 20 014 million disclosed above as disbursed, the EU guarantees a further
EUR 161 million of outstanding loans to Syria for which provisions have been made, and EUR 20 million
recognised as financial guarantee liability for the EIB Economic Resilience Initiative (ERI) Private Mandate
(see below).

The EU external lending mandate guarantee relating to loans granted by the EIB is limited to 65 % of the
outstanding balances for agreements signed after 2007 (mandates 2007-2013 and 2014-2020). For
agreements made before 2007, the EU guarantee is limited to a percentage of the ceiling of the credit
lines authorised, in most cases 65 % but also 70 %, 75 % or 100 %. Where the ceiling is not reached,
the EU guarantee covers the full amount.

According to Decision (EU) 2018/412, up to EUR 2.3 billion shall be allocated to the new private sector
lending mandate for projects directed to the long term economic resilience of refugees, migrants, host
and transit communities under the EIB ERI. The EIB has disbursed the first ERI Private Mandate
operations in 2019. The Union budget is remunerated for the risk taken in relation to guarantees granted



                                                     70

                                 Annual accounts of the European Union 2019

for EIB finacing operations under the ERI Private Mandate, hence the ERI Private Mandate guarantee is
accounted for as a financial guarantee liability (see note 2.11.3).

EU guarantee payments are made by the Guarantee Fund for external actions – see note 2.4.1. During
2019, EUR 55 million of guarantee calls have been paid out from the Guarantee Fund for external actions
(2018: EUR 56 million).

European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI) guarantee

EFSI is an initiative that aims to increase the risk bearing capacity of the EIB Group by enabling the EIB
to extend its investments in the EU. The objective of EFSI is to support additional investments in the EU
and access to finance for small companies. The EU budget provides a guarantee of up to EUR 26 billion
('EFSI EU guarantee') under an agreement between the EU and the EIB, hereinafter referred to as 'EFSI
Agreement', in order to protect the EIB from potential losses it may suffer from its financing and
investment operations.

The EFSI operations are conducted within two windows: the Infrastructure and Innovation Window (IIW)
implemented by the EIB (EFSI EU guarantee of EUR 19.5 billion) and the SME Window (SMEW)
implemented by the EIF (EFSI EU guarantee of EUR 6.5 billion), both of which have a debt portfolio and
an equity portfolio. The EIF acts under an agreement with the EIB on the basis of an EIB guarantee,
which itself is counter-guaranteed by the EFSI EU Guarantee under the EFSI Agreement.

The EU and the EIB have distinct roles within EFSI. EFSI is established within the EIB who finance the
operations (debt and equity investments) and, to do this, borrow the necessary funds on the capital
markets. The EIB Group takes the investment decisions independently and manages the operations in
accordance with its rules and procedures. The EU provides the guarantee for those operations, and
covers losses incurred by the EIB up to the ceiling of this guarantee.

In order to ensure that investments made under EFSI remain focused on the specific objective of
addressing market failures and that they are eligible for the protection of the EU guarantee, a dedicated
governance structure has been put in place, including an Investment Committee of independent experts
which examines each project proposed by the EIB under the IIW regarding its eligibility for the EU
guarantee coverage and EFSI Steering Board ensuring an oversight over the programme.

As the control criteria and accounting requirements for consolidation under the EU accounting rules (and
IPSAS) are not met, the related guaranteed assets are not accounted for in the consolidated annual
accounts of the EU.

The EU guarantee granted to the EIB Group under EFSI is accounted for as a financial guarantee liability
in respect of the IIW debt portfolio (see note 2.11.3), as a financial provision for the SMEW debt portfolio
and as a derivative (financial asset or liability at fair value through surplus or deficit) for both equity
portfolios (see note 2.4.2). In addition, a contingent liability related to the EFSI guarantee given is
disclosed in this note. The EFSI contingent liability includes operations of the COSME, H2020, CCS LGF
and EaSI programmes for the part covered by the EFSI EU guarantee under SMEW debt portfolio, and is
presented net of EUR 74 million of financial provisions recognised for this portfolio, as included under
the heading financial provisions in the note 2.10.

EU guarantee payments, not covered by the EU revenues standing in credit on the EFSI settlement
account at the EIB, are made by the EFSI Guarantee Fund – see note 2.4.1. During 2019 no guarantee
calls have been paid out from the EFSI Guarantee Fund (2018: EUR 61 million).

European Fund for Sustainable Development (EFSD)


The European Fund for Sustainable Development, established by the EFSD Regulation, is an initiative
aiming to support investments in Africa and the European Neighbourhood as a means to contribute to the
achievement of the sustainable development and to address specific socioeconomic root causes of
migration. Under the EFSD Regulation, the EU should make available guarantees of EUR 1.5 billion
(further increased by external contributions) to implementing partners for their investment and financing
operations, in order to reduce their investment risks. The EFSD Guarantee is backed by the EFSD
Guarantee Fund (see note 2.4.1). As at 31 December 2019, one EFSD guarantee agreement ’Framework
to Scale Up Renewable Energy Investments‘, was effective, but no underlying financing operations were
signed by the implementing partner, EBRD.

The EU budget guarantees the borrowings of the Commission taken to finance lending to Member and
non-Member States in back-to-back transactions. These borrowings are already recognised as liabilities
on the EU balance sheet – see note 2.11.1. However, should there be a default on the back-to-back-
loans given out with these borrowings, the EU budget, based on Article 14 of Council Regulation
2014/609, would have to bear the full cost of the amount defaulted:

    •    Borrowings related to loans disbursed under the EFSM are guaranteed solely by the EU budget;

    •    Borrowings related to BOP loans are guaranteed solely by the EU budget;

    •    MFA loans are firstly guaranteed by the Guarantee Fund for external actions (see note 2.4.1) and
         then by the EU budget; and

    •    Guarantees from third parties are the first cover for the entire amounts of the outstanding
         Euratom loans. The Guarantee Fund would cover the external lending amounts should the third
         party guarantors not provide for them.


4.1.3.    Guarantees given for EU financial instruments


                                                                                                    EUR million

As mentioned in Article 210(1) FR, the budgetary expenditure linked to a financial instrument and the
financial liability of the EU shall in no case exceed the amount of the relevant budgetary commitment
made for it, thus excluding contingent liabilities for the budget. In practice, it means that these liabilities
have a counter-part on the asset side of the balance sheet or are covered by the outstanding budgetary
commitments not yet expensed. The contingent liabilities above are shown net of financial provisions and
financial liabilities recognised for these instruments – see notes 2.10 and 2.11.2.

Fines

These amounts mainly concern fines imposed by the Commission for infringement of competition rules
that have been provisionally paid by fined companies and where either an appeal has been lodged or
where it is unknown whether an appeal will be made. The contingent liability will be maintained until a
decision by the Court of Justice on the case is final or until the expiry of the period for appeal. Interest
earned on provisional payments is included in the economic result of the year and also as a contingent
liability to reflect the uncertainty of the Commission’s title to these amounts.

Should the EU lose any of the cases relating to fines imposed, the amounts that have been provisionally
received will be returned to the companies without budgetary impact. The amount of fines is only
recognised as budgetary revenue when the fines are definitive (Article 107 FR).

Agriculture

These are contingent liabilities towards the Member States connected with EAGF and rural development
conformity decisions pending judgement of the Court of Justice. The determination of the final amount of
the liability and the year in which the effect of successful appeals will be charged to the budget will
depend on the length of the procedure before the Court.

Cohesion

These are contingent liabilities towards the Member States in connection with actions under cohesion
policy awaiting the oral hearing date or pending judgement of the Court of Justice. The increase comes
from two cases concerning eligible expenses and Member States accounts.

Other legal cases

This heading relates to actions for damages currently being brought against the EU, other legal disputes
and the estimated legal costs. It should be noted that in an action for damages under Article 340 TFEU,
the applicant must demonstrate a sufficiently serious breach by the institution of a rule of law intended to
confer rights on individuals, real harm suffered by the applicant, and a direct causal link between the
unlawful act and the harm. The amount for 2019 (as in 2018) mainly concerns a damages claim against
the Commission for a merger prohibition decision, where, in the absence of a reliable estimate, the
amount disclosed relates to the claimed amount. The increase in 2019 relates to damages claims
concerning a Commission delegated regulation, annuled by the General Court.

5.       BUDGETARY AND LEGAL COMMITMENTS
This note provides information on the budgetary process and future funding needs and not on liabilities
existing as at 31 December 2019.

The multiannual financial framework (MFF) agreed by the Member States defines the programmes and
sets out the heading ceilings for commitment appropriations and the total for payment appropriations
within which the EU may enter into budgetary and legal commitments, and ultimately make payments for
a period of 7 years – see table 1.1 in the notes to the budgetary implementation reports.

The MFF ceilings were adopted by the Council (Member States), with the consent of the European
Parliament, and Article 16 of Regulation 2013/1306 on the financing of the CAP makes a direct link
between the annual ceiling of EAGF expenditure and the MFF Regulation. The European Parliament and
the Council also adopted the respective basic acts for the EAGF expenditure that set out the expenditure
per Member State for the entire period 2014-2020.

Legal commitments correspond to programmes, projects, agreements or contracts signed, thus legally
binding the EU. A legal commitment is the act whereby the authorising officer enters or establishes an
obligation (for the EU) which results in a charge (Article 2(37) FR).

A budgetary commitment is in principle made before the legal commitment, but for some multiannual
programmes/projects it is the reverse, the relevant budgetary commitments being made in annual
instalments, over several years, when the basic act so provides for. For example, for cohesion, Article 76
of the Common Provisions Regulation (CPR) (Regulation (EU) No 2013/1303) provides that the decision
of the Commission adopting a programme shall constitute a legal commitment within the meaning of the
Financial Regulation but that the budget commitments of the Union in respect of each programme shall
be made in annual instalments for each fund during the period between 1 January 2014 and
31 December 2020. Other legal bases may contain similar provisions. For this reason, there may be
amounts that the EU has legally committed to pay, but where the budgetary commitment has not yet
been made – see notes 5.2 and 5.3 below.

If the budgetary commitment has been made but the subsequent payments are not yet made, the
amount of outstanding commitments is called ‘Reste à Liquider’ (RAL). This can represent programmes or
projects, often multiannual, signed and for which payments will only be made in later years. They
represent payment obligations for future years. As the financial statements are prepared on an accrual
basis, whereas the budgetary implementation reports are prepared on a cash basis, part of the overall
amounts unpaid (RAL) has already been expensed and is recognised as a liability on the balance sheet
(see notes 2.12 and 2.13). The calculation of these expenses is made based either on cost
claims/invoices received or on the estimated implementation of a programme or project where no claims
have been notified yet to the EU until the reporting date – see note 5.1 below. Once the payments
relating to the RAL are made, the liability on the balance sheet is derecognised. The part of the RAL not
expensed yet is not included under liabilities but is instead disclosed below.

The disclosures below thus represent amounts at 31 December 2019 that the EU has committed to pay
based on the fulfilment of the contractual agreements and which are therefore intended to be funded by
future EU budgets.

                                                                                               EUR million

5.1.     OUTSTANDING BUDGETARY COMMITMENTS NOT YET
         EXPENSED

                                                                                                  EUR million
                                                                               31.12.2019       31.12.2018
Outstanding budgetary commitments not yet expensed                                 249 686          235 836

The amount disclosed above is the budgetary RAL (‘Reste à Liquider’) of EUR 297 693 million (see
table 4.4 in the notes to the budgetary implementation reports), less related amounts that have been
included as liabilities on the balance sheet and as expenses in the statement of financial performance.
The budgetary RAL is an amount representing the open commitments for which payments and/or de-
commitments have not yet been made. As explained above, this is the normal consequence of the
existence of multiannual programmes.

It should be noted that outstanding pre-financing advances at 31 December 2019 totalled EUR 51 billion
(see note 2.5). This represents budgetary commitments that have been paid, decreasing the RAL, but
where the amounts paid are still considered as belonging to the EU and not to the beneficiary, until the
relevant contractual obligations are fulfilled. They are thus, like the RAL disclosed above, not yet
expensed.

These are legal obligations that the EU has committed to paying when adopting the operational
programmes related to shared management. The decision of the Commission adopting an operational
programme constitutes a financing decision within the meaning of Article 110 FR and once notified to the
Member State concerned, a legal commitment within the meaning of that Regulation.

Article 76 of the CPR for European Structural and Investment Funds (ESIF) states:

‘The budget commitments of the Union in respect of each programme shall be made in annual
instalments for each Fund during the period between 1 January 2014 and 31 December 2020. The budget
commitments relating to the performance reserve in each programme shall be made separately from the
remaining allocation to the programme.’

The table above provides an overview of the legal and budgetary commitments related to the headings
1B, 2 and 3 of the MFF 2014-2020. The table starts by disclosing the total MFF amounts voted for the
period (column A). Column B shows the legal commitments concluded by the EU at year-end, some of
which are not yet covered by budgetary commitments. Column C contains the budgetary commitments
already made to cover the above mentioned legal commitments. The difference between these two
columns represents the outstanding amounts that the EU will commit budgetarily and then pay after
31 December 2019. As the end of the MFF period approaches, the difference between legal commitments
and budgetary commitments reduces significantly (EUR 72.8 billion compared to EUR 143.8 billion in
2018).


5.3.     SIGNIFICANT LEGAL COMMITMENTS IN OTHER AREAS

                                                                                             EUR million

These amounts reflect the long-term legal commitments that were not yet covered by commitment
appropriations in the budget at year-end. These binding obligations will be budgeted in annual
instalments in future years and paid.

Certain important programmes (see below) may be implemented by annual instalments according to
Article 112(2) FR. This allows the EU to make legal commitments (sign grant agreements, delegation
agreements and procurement contracts) in excess of the available commitment appropriations of a given
year. Therefore a substantial amount of the overall allocation for the current MFF may be already
committed. This applies in particular for the programmes described below:

Connecting Europe Facility (CEF)

The CEF provides financial assistance to trans-European networks in order to support projects of common
interest in the sectors of transport, telecommunications and energy infrastructures. The legal
commitments for the CEF programme cover an implementation period running from 2014 until 2023 for
the CEF Transport and up to 31.12.2024 for CEF Energy. The legal basis of these commitments is
Regulation (EU) No 2013/1316 of the EP and of the Council of 11 December 2013 establishing the
Connecting Europe Facility, amending Regulation (EU) No 2010/913 and repealing Regulations (EC) No
2007/680 and (EC) No 2010/67 Text with EEA relevance (OJ L 348, 20 December 2013) which foresees
the use of the annual instalment in its article 19.

Copernicus

Copernicus is the European Earth observation programme – see also note 2.2. These commitments are
made for the period until 2020. Based on Regulation (EU) 2014/377 of the EP and Council of 3 April 2014
(OJ L 122/44 of 24 April 2014) the Commission signed delegation agreements with the European Space
Agency (ESA), EUMETSAT, Mercator and the European Centre for Medium Range weather forecasts.
Article 8 of Regulation 2014/377 authorises the use of annual instalments.

ITER – International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor

These commitments are intended to cover future funding needs of the ITER facilities up to 2021. The EU
(Euratom) contribution to ITER International is given through the Fusion for Energy Agency, including
also the contributions from Member States and from Switzerland. These commitments are made on the

basis of Council decision (Euratom) 2013/791 of 13 December 2013 amending decision (Euratom)
2007/198 establishing the European Joint Undertaking for ITER and the Development of Fusion Energy
which authorises the use of annual instalments. ITER was created to manage and to encourage the
exploitation of the ITER facilities, to promote public understanding and acceptance of fusion energy, and
to undertake any other activities that are necessary to achieve its purpose. ITER involves the EU, China,
India, Russia, South Korea, Japan and the USA.

Galileo

These are amounts committed to the Galileo programme developing a European Global Navigation
Satellite System – see also note 2.2. These commitments are made for the period until 2020. Based on
Regulation (EU) 2013/1285 of the EP and Council of 11 December 2013 (OJ L 347/1 of
20 December 2013) the Commission signed a delegation agreement with ESA. Article 9 of Regulation
(EU) 2013/1285 authorises the use of annual instalments.

Fisheries agreements

These represent commitments entered into with third countries for operations under international
fisheries agreements up to 2025. The commitments made are based on Council decisions for each third
country (e.g. Agreement between the EU and the Kingdom of Morocco, the Implementation Protocol
thereto and the Exchange of Letters accompanying the Agreement; OJ L 77, 20.3.2019) and are
considered specific international treaties with multiannual rights and obligations.

Operating lease commitments

Minimum amounts committed to be paid according to the underlying contracts during the remaining term
of these lease contracts are as follows:

In March 2019, in the context of the United Kingdom’s notification of its intention to withdraw from the
EU, and as a result of Regulation (EU) 2018/1718 of the European Parliament and of the Council of
14 November 2018 amending Regulation (EC) No 2004/726, the seat of the European Medicines Agency
(EMA) was relocated from London to Amsterdam. On 2 July 2019, the Agency reached an agreement with
its landlord and since then has sublet its premises to a subtenant under conditions that are consistent
with the ones of the headlease, including the sublease term that extends until the expiry of EMA’s
headlease in June 2039.

The amounts disclosed in the table above include EUR 418 million still due under the headlease contract.
An equal amount of payments is expected to be received by the subtenant under the non-cancellable
sublease.

Other contractual commitments

The amounts included under this disclosure correspond to amounts committed to be paid during the term
of the contracts. The most significant amount included here relates to a building contract (JMO2) of the
Commission in Luxembourg (EUR 381 million).

6.         FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT
The following disclosures with regard to the financial risk management of the EU relate to:

     •   Borrowing and lending activities for financial assistance carried out by the Commission through
         EFSM, BOP, MFA, and Euratom actions;

     •   The treasury operations carried out by the Commission in order to implement the EU budget,
         including the receipt of fines;

     •   Assets held in funds for budgetary guarantees: the Guarantee Fund for external actions, the EFSI
         Guarantee Fund and the EFSD Guarantee Fund; and

     •   Financial instruments financed by the EU budget.


6.1.       TYPES OF RISK

Market risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate,
because of variations in market prices. Market risk embodies not only the potential for loss, but also the
potential for gain. It comprises currency risk, interest rate risk and other price risk (the EU has no
significant other price risk).

     •   Currency risk is the risk that the EU's operations or its investments' value will be affected by
         changes in exchange rates. This risk arises from the change in price of one currency against
         another.

     •   Interest rate risk is the possibility of a reduction in the value of a security, especially a bond,
         resulting from an increase in interest rates. In general, higher interest rates will lead to lower
         prices of fixed rate bonds, and vice versa.

Credit risk is the risk of loss due to a debtor's / borrower's non-payment of a loan or other line of credit
(either the principal or interest or both) or other failure to meet a contractual obligation. The default
events include a delay in repayments, restructuring of borrower repayments and bankruptcy.

Liquidity risk is the risk that arises from the difficulty in selling an asset; for example, the risk that a
given security or asset cannot be traded quickly enough in the market to prevent a loss or meet an
obligation.


6.2.       RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES

The implementation of the EU budget relies increasingly on the use of operational programme financial
instruments. For more information on the amounts concerned, see note 2.4.1.

Common to most financial instruments is the fact that the implementation is delegated to either the EIB
group (including EIF) or to other financial institutions based on an agreement between the Commission
and the financial institution. Agreements signed with these financial institutions include strict conditions
and obligations on the intermediaries so as to ensure that EU monies are properly managed and reported
on. Once a financial contribution to one of the instruments has been committed, the funds are transferred
to a specifically created bank account opened by the financial institution in its name but on behalf of the
Commission (i.e. a fiduciary account). The financial institution may, depending on the instrument in
question, use the funds on this fiduciary account to provide loans, issue debt instruments, invest in
equity instruments or cover the guarantee calls. Proceeds from financial instruments have, as a general
rule, to be reimbursed to the EU budget.

The risk as regards these financial instruments is limited to a ceiling as indicated in the underlying
agreements, which is the budgeted amount foreseen for the instrument. As the Commission often bears
the ’first loss piece‘ and since instruments are intended to finance riskier beneficiaries (who have
difficulties in obtaining funding from commercial lenders), it is therefore likely that some losses to the EU
budget will occur.

Measurement of financial instruments

The following classes of financial assets and liabilities are not measured at fair value: cash and cash
equivalents, loans, exchange receivables and non-exchange recoverables, borrowings and other financial
liabilities measured at amortised cost. The carrying amount of those financial assets and liabilities is
considered as a reasonable approximation of their fair value.

Borrowing and lending activities for financial assistance

The borrowing and lending transactions are carried out by the EU according to the respective Council
Regulations, Council and EP Decisions, and, if applicable, internal guidelines. Written procedure manuals
covering specific areas such as borrowings and loans have been developed and are used by the relevant
operational units. Lending operations are financed by ’back-to-back‘ borrowings, which thus do not
generate open interest rate or currency positions.

Treasury

The rules and principles for the management of the Commission's treasury operations are laid down in
the Council Regulation 2014/609 (as amended by Council Regulation 2016/804) and in the Financial
Regulation.

As a result of the above regulations, the following main principles apply:

    •   Own resources are paid by the Member States into accounts opened for this purpose in the name
        of the Commission with the treasury or national central bank. The Commission may draw on the
        above accounts solely to cover its cash requirements.

    •   Own resources are paid by Member States in their own national currencies, while the
        Commission's payments are mostly denominated in EUR.

    •   Bank accounts opened in the name of      the Commission may not be overdrawn. This restriction
        does not apply to the Commission's       own resource accounts in case of a default on loans
        contracted or guaranteed pursuant to     EU Council regulations and decisions and under certain
        conditions in case the cash resource     requirements are in excess of the cash held in those
        accounts.

    •   Funds held in bank accounts denominated in currencies other than EUR are either used for
        payments in the same currencies or periodically converted in EUR.

In addition to the own resources accounts, other bank accounts are opened by the Commission, with
central banks and commercial banks, for the purpose of executing payments and receiving receipts other
than the Member State contributions to the budget.

Treasury and payment operations are highly automated and rely on modern information systems.
Specific procedures are applied to guarantee system security and to ensure segregation of duties in line
with the Financial Regulation, the Commission’s internal control standards, and audit principles.

A written set of guidelines and procedures regulate the management of the Commission's treasury and
payment operations with the objective of limiting operational and financial risk and ensuring an adequate
level of control. They cover different areas of operation (for example: payment execution and cash
management, cashflow forecasting, business continuity, etc.), and compliance with the guidelines and
procedures is checked regularly.

Fines

Provisionally cashed fines: deposits

Amounts received before 2010 remain in bank accounts with banks specifically selected for the deposit of
provisionally cashed fines. The selection of banks is conducted in compliance with tender procedures
defined by the Financial Regulation. Placement of funds with specific banks is determined by the internal
risk management policy defining the credit rating requirements and the amount of funds which could be
placed in proportion to the counterparty equity. Financial and operational risks are identified and
evaluated and compliance with internal policies and procedures is checked regularly.

Provisionally cashed fines: BUFI portfolio

Fines imposed and provisionally cashed from 2010 onwards are invested in a specifically created
portfolio, BUFI. The main objectives of the portfolio are the reduction of risks associated with financial
markets and the equal treatment of all entities by applying a guaranteed return calculated on the same
basis to the nominal amount of fines. However, the guaranteed return applied to entities fined before the
entry into force of the new Financial Regulation in August 2018 is floored at zero. The asset management
for provisionally cashed fines is carried out by the Commission in accordance with internal asset
management guidelines. Procedural manuals covering specific areas such as treasury management have
been developed and are used by the relevant operational units. Financial and operational risks are
identified and evaluated and compliance with internal guidelines and procedures is checked regularly.

The objectives of the asset management activities are to invest the fines provisionally paid to the
Commission in such a way as to:
    •   ensure that the funds are easily available when needed, while
    •   aiming at delivering, under normal circumstances, a return which on average is in line with the
        return of the BUFI Benchmark minus costs incurred, while preserving the nominal amount for the
        fines which were imposed by the Commission before the entry into force of the new Financial
        Regulation in August 2018.

Investments are restricted essentially to the following categories: term deposits with Member States'
central banks, sovereign debt agencies, fully state-owned or state-guaranteed banks or supranational
institutions, and bonds, bills and certificates of deposit issued by either sovereign or supranational
institutions.

Financial guarantees

Significant amounts of guarantees issued by financial institutions are held by the Commission in relation
to the fines it imposes on companies breaching EU competition rules (see note 2.6.1.2). These
guarantees are provided by fined companies as an alternative to making provisional payments. The
guarantees are managed in compliance with the internal risk management policy. Financial and
operational risks are identified and evaluated and compliance with internal policies and procedures is
checked regularly.

Guarantee Fund for external actions

The rules and principles for the asset management of the Guarantee Fund are laid out in the Convention
between the Commission and the EIB dated 25 November 1994 and the subsequent amendments. This
Guarantee Fund operates only in euros. It exclusively invests in this currency in order to avoid any
foreign currency risk. Management of the assets is based upon the traditional rules of prudence adhered
to for financial activities. It is required to pay particular attention to reducing the risks and to ensuring
that the managed assets can be sold or transferred without significant delay, taking into account the
commitments covered.

EFSI Guarantee Fund

The EFSI Guarantee Fund was established by the EFSI Regulation – see note 2.4.1. The rules and
principles for the asset management of the fund are laid out in the Commission Decision C(2016)165 of
21 January 2016. The fund is managed by the Commission, which is authorised to invest the assets of
the EFSI Guarantee Fund on the financial markets in accordance with the principle of sound financial
management following appropriate prudential rules. The managed assets shall provide sufficient liquidity
in relation to potential guarantee calls, while still aiming at optimising the return and risk level that is
compatible with maintaining a high degree of security and stability.

EFSD Guarantee Fund

EFSD Guarantee Fund has been established pursuant to the EFSD Regulation – see note 2.4.1. The
management of the EFSD Guarantee Fund assets is carried out by the Commission in accordance with
internal guidelines and asset management guidelines which are included as Annex 1 to Commission
Decision C(2017)7693 of 22 November 2017. The Commission is authorised to invest the assets of the
EFSD Guarantee Fund on the financial markets following the principle of sound financial management and
appropriate prudential rules. The assets are managed in such a way so as to provide sufficient liquidity in
relation to the potential guarantee calls, while still aiming at optimising the return and risk level that is
compatible with maintaining a high degree of security and stability.

Borrowing and lending activities for financial assistance

Financial assets and liabilities are currently only in EUR, so the EU has no foreign currency risk.

Treasury

Own resources paid by Member States in currencies other than EUR are kept on the own resources
accounts, in accordance with Council Regulation 2014/609 (as amended by Council regulation 2016/804).
They are converted into EUR when they are needed for the execution of payments. The procedures
applied for the management of these funds are laid down by the above referred regulation. In a limited
number of cases, these funds are directly used for payments to be executed in the same currencies.

A number of accounts in EU currencies other than EUR, and in USD and CHF, are held by the Commission
with commercial banks, for the purpose of executing payments denominated in these same currencies.
These accounts are replenished depending on the amount of payments to be executed, as a consequence
their balances do not represent exposure to currency risk.

When miscellaneous receipts (receipts other than own resources) are received in currencies other than
EUR, they are either transferred to Commission's accounts held in the same currencies, if they are
needed to cover the execution of payments, or converted into EUR and transferred to accounts held in
EUR. Imprest accounts held in currencies other than EUR are replenished depending on the estimated
short-term local payment needs in the same currencies. Balances on these accounts are kept within their
respective ceilings.

                                  Annual accounts of the European Union 2019

Fines

All fines are imposed, paid or provisionally covered in EUR and therefore do not pose any foreign
currency risk.

Guarantee Fund for external actions

The financial assets of this fund are in EUR so there is no currency risk. The loans subrogated to the EU
as result of calls on the fund, following payment defaults by a loan beneficiary, are carried out in their
original currency and therefore expose the EU to currency risk. There are no activities to compensate
foreign currency variations (‘hedging‘ activities) due to uncertainty relating to the loans’ repayment
timing.

EFSI Guarantee Fund

The EFSI Guarantee Fund currently operates in both EUR and USD. Currency risk is managed through
entering into derivative contracts (foreign exchange forward contracts) hedging the market value of the
USD investments portfolio. The limit for maximum unhedged foreign exchange exposure is set at 1 % of
the total portfolio value within the benchmark and annual strategy allocations. Thus, upward or
downward movements in the USD investments' market value above or below the 1 % limit would trigger
a rebalancing trade (a new forward contract with the same or opposite direction), adjusting or reversing
the hedged position accordingly. Readjustment of the hedge may also be prompted by movements of the
EUR/USD exchange rate.

The loans subrogated to the EU as result of calls on the fund following payment defaults by a loan
beneficiary are carried out in their original currency and therefore expose the EU to currency risk. For the
subrogated loans, there are no activities to compensate foreign currency variations (‘hedging‘ activities)
due to uncertainty relating to the loans’ repayment timing.

EFSD Guarantee Fund

The EFSD Guarantee Fund currently operates in EUR only, but the asset management guidelines for the
EFSD Guarantee Fund provide for the possibility to invest in certain non-EUR denominated assets.

Borrowing and lending activities for financial assistance

Due to the nature of its borrowing and lending activities, the EU has significant interest-bearing assets
and liabilities. However, there is no interest rate risk since the borrowings are offset by equivalent loans
at the same terms and conditions (back-to-back).

Treasury

The Commission's treasury does not borrow money; so as a consequence, it is not exposed to interest
rate risk. Interest is however calculated on balances held on the different bank accounts. The
Commission has therefore put in place measures to ensure that interest earned on its bank accounts
regularly reflects market interest rates, as well as their possible fluctuation.

Accounts opened with Member States treasuries for own resources receipts are non-interest bearing and
free of charge. Accounts held with national central banks (own resources and other) may be remunerated

                                                      83
-----------------------Page 86 End-----------------------

                                 Annual accounts of the European Union 2019

at the official rates applied by each institution. As some of the remunerations applied to these accounts
may currently be negative, cash management procedures are in place to minimise balances kept on these
accounts. Own resources accounts are protected from any impact of negative interest in accordance with
Council Regulation 2014/609 and as amended by Council Regulation 2016/804.

Overnight balances held on commercial bank accounts earn interest on a daily basis. This is based on
variable market rates to which a contractual margin (positive or negative) is applied. The rates applied by
commercial banks are in general floored at zero for operational balances up to a specified ceiling.

Sensitivity to interests rate changes of a given portfolio of money market instruments and bonds
increases with its duration. The duration of the main asset portfolios managed by the Commission is
described below.

Fines

The provisionally cashed fines are invested in a portfolio of money market instruments and long-term
bonds with an average portfolio duration of 2.57 years.

Guarantee Fund for external actions

The budget provisioned in the Guarantee Fund is invested in a portfolio of money market instruments and
long-term bonds with a total average portfolio duration of 2.99 years.

EFSI Guarantee Fund

The budget provisioned in the EFSI Guarantee Fund is invested in a portfolio of money market
instruments and long-term bonds with a total average portfolio duration of 3.07 years.

EFSD Guarantee Fund

The budget provisioned in the EFSD Guarantee Fund is invested in a portfolio of money market
instruments and long-term bonds with a total average portfolio duration of 2.51 years.

                                  Annual accounts of the European Union 2019

The EU uses these external agencies rating categories as a reference point notably for financial
instruments and commercial banks, but may, after making its own analysis of individual cases, keep
amounts in one of the above risk categories even though one or more of the above mentioned rating
agencies may have downgraded the corresponding counterparty. As regards non-rated counterparties,
group 1 relates to debtors without defaults in the past and group 2 relates to debtors with defaults in the
past.

The amounts displayed above under loans categorised in non-investment grade relate primarily to
financial support loans disbursed by the Commission to partner countries in financial difficulties. The
amount under receivables and recoverables relates to recoverables against certain Members States based
on own resources regulations or other legal basis. The amount under cash relates mainly to own
resources bank accounts opened in the treasury or in the central banks of certain Member States to hold
the own resources contributions as foreseen in the above referred regulation. The Commission may draw
on these accounts solely to cover cash requirements for the implementation of the budget.

Borrowing and lending activities for financial assistance

Exposure to credit risk is managed firstly by obtaining state guarantees in the case of Euratom, then
through the Guarantee Fund for external actions (MFA & Euratom), then by the possibility of drawing the
necessary funds from the Commission's own resources accounts with the Member States and ultimately
through the EU budget.

The Own Resources legislation fixes the ceiling for own resources payments at 1.20 % of Member States'
GNI and during 2019 0.88 % was actually used to cover payment appropriations. This means that at 31
December 2019 there existed an available margin of 0.32 % to cover these guarantees. To this end, the
EU is entitled to call upon Member States to ensure compliance with the EU's legal obligation towards its
lenders.

Treasury

Most of the Commission's treasury resources are kept, in accordance with Council Regulation 609/2014
(as amended by Council Regulation 804/2016) on own resources, in the accounts opened by Member
States for the payment of their contributions (own resources). All such accounts are held with Member
States' treasuries or national central banks. These institutions carry the lowest credit (or counterparty)
risk for the Commission as the exposure is with its Member States. For the part of the Commission's
treasury resources kept with commercial banks, in order to cover the execution of payments,
replenishment of these accounts is made on a just-in-time basis and is automatically managed by the
treasury cash management system. Minimum cash levels, which take into account the average amount of
daily payments executed from it, are kept on each account. As a consequence the total amount kept
overnight on these accounts remains constantly at low levels (overall less than EUR 70 million on
average, spread over around 20 accounts) and so it is ensured that the Commission's risk exposure is
limited. These amounts should be viewed with regard to the daily overall treasury balances which
fluctuated in 2019 between EUR 6 billion and EUR 40 billion, and with an overall amount of payments
made from Commission accounts in 2019 that exceeded EUR 158 billion.

In addition, specific guidelines are applied for the selection of commercial banks in order to further
minimise counterparty risk to which the Commission is exposed:

    •   All commercial banks are selected by call for tenders. The minimum short-term credit rating
        required for admission to the tendering procedures is Moody's P-1 or equivalent. A lower level
        may be accepted in specific and duly justified circumstances.

    •   The credit ratings of the commercial banks where the Commission has accounts are monitored on
        a daily basis.

    •   In delegations outside the EU, imprest accounts are held with local banks selected by a simplified
        tendering procedure. Rating requirements depend on the local situation and may significantly
        differ from one country to another. In order to limit risk exposure, balances on these accounts
        are kept at the lowest possible levels (taking into account operational needs), they are regularly
        replenished, and the applied ceilings are reviewed on a yearly basis.

Fines

Provisionally cashed fines: deposits

Banks holding deposits for the fines provisionally cashed before 2010 are selected by tender procedure in
compliance with the risk management policy which defines the credit rating requirements and the amount
of funds which could be placed in proportion to the counterparty equity.

For commercial banks that have been specifically selected for the deposit of provisionally cashed fines, a
minimum long-term rating A- (S&P or equivalent) with two rating agencies is required as a general rule.
Specific measures are applied in case banks in this group are subject to downgrade. In addition, the
amount deposited with each bank is limited to a certain percentage of its own funds, which varies
depending on the rating level of each institution. The calculation of such limits also takes into account the
amount of outstanding guarantees issued to the Commission by the same institution. The compliance of
outstanding deposits with the applicable policy requirements is reviewed regularly.

Provisionally cashed fines: BUFI portfolio

For sovereign debt investments from provisionally cashed fines imposed as from 2010, the Commission
takes on the exposure to credit risk. The highest concentration of exposure is towards Spain, which
represents 20 % of the portfolio. The five countries with the highest exposure (Spain, Italy, Germany,
France and Belgium) represent altogether 52 % of the investment portfolio. The weighted average credit
rating of the portfolio is A (S&P or equivalent).

Financial guarantees

The risk management policy applied for the acceptance of such guarantees ensures a high credit quality
for the Commission. The policy includes defining a maximum credit exposure towards a particular
financial sector entity based on its credit rating and the level of an entity’s capital as accounted for in its
IFRS financial statements. The compliance of the outstanding guarantees with the applicable policy
requirements is reviewed regularly.

Guarantee Fund for external actions

The asset management guidelines and/or investment strategy define certain limits and restrictions in
order to limit the exposure to credit risk of the portfolio. Such limits and restrictions include eligibility
criteria, absolute credit limits in nominal terms depending on issuer category, relative concentration limits
depending on issuer category and concentration limits per issue. All investments are rated at least as
investment grade.

EFSI Guarantee Fund

The asset management guidelines, risk and investment strategies define certain limits and restrictions in
order to limit the exposure to credit risk of the portfolio which is limited to investment grade, except for
EU Member States exposure. The weighted average credit rating of the portfolio is BBB+ (S&P or
equivalent).

As the sole counterparty for all outstanding currency forwards as of 31 December 2019 is the Banque de
France, no credit enhancements, such as collateral, netting agreements, or guarantees are put in place
as of this date. The maximum exposure to credit risk for foreign exchange derivatives having a positive
fair value at the end of the reporting period is equal to the carrying amount on the balance sheet.

EFSD Guarantee Fund

The asset management guidelines, risk and investment strategies define certain limits and restrictions in
order to limit the exposure to credit risk of the portfolio, which is limited to investment grade, except for
EU Member States exposure. The weighted average credit rating of the portfolio is BBB+ (S&P or
equivalent).

Borrowing and lending activities for financial assistance

The liquidity risk that arises from borrowings is generally offset by equivalent loans in terms and
conditions (back-to-back operations). For MFA and Euratom, the Guarantee Fund for external actions
serves as a liquidity reserve (or safety net) in case of payment default and payment delays of borrowers.
For BOP, the Council Regulation 2009/431 provides for a procedure allowing sufficient time to mobilise
funds through the Commission's own resources accounts with the Member States. For EFSM, the Council
Regulation 2010/407 provides for a similar procedure.

Treasury

EU budget principles ensure that overall cash resources for a given year are always sufficient for the
execution of all payments. In fact, the total Member States contributions together with the miscellaneous
revenue equal the amount of payment appropriations for the budgetary year. Member States’
contributions, however, are received in twelve monthly instalments throughout the year and based on the
adopted budget, while payments are subject to operational needs. Moreover, in accordance with the
Council Regulation 609/2014 (on the methods and procedure for making available own resources,
amended by Council Regulation 804/2016), Member States contributions relating to amending budgets
approved in a given month (N) only become available either on the first working day of the month N+1
(if approved before the 16th of the given month) or on the first working day of month N+2 (if approved
on the 16th or later of that given month), while the related payment appropriations are immediately
available.

In order to ensure that available treasury resources are always sufficient to cover the payments to be
executed in any given month, procedures regarding regular cash forecasting are in place, and own
resources or additional funding can be called up in advance from Member States if needed, up to certain
limits and under certain conditions. Operational needs and overall budgetary restrictions in recent years
have resulted in the need for increased monitoring of the rhythm of payments over the year. In addition
to the above, in the context of the Commission's daily treasury operations, automated cash management
tools ensure that sufficient liquidity is available on each of the Commission's bank accounts, on a daily
basis.

Fines

The BUFI fund where provisionally paid fines are invested is managed according to the principle that the
assets shall have a sufficient degree of liquidity and mobilisation in relation to the relevant commitments.

                                                      88
-----------------------Page 91 End-----------------------

                                   Annual accounts of the European Union 2019

The portfolio is composed of mostly highly liquid securities that can be sold to meet short-term cash
outflows. In addition, the share of cash, cash equivalents and securities maturing within 1 year is 24 %.

Guarantee Fund for external actions

The fund is managed according to the principle that the assets shall have a sufficient degree of liquidity
and mobilisation in relation to the relevant commitments. The fund therefore maintains a sufficient
amount of monetary assets to cover short-term cash outflows. The share of cash, cash equivalents and
securities maturing within 1 year is 11 %.

EFSI Guarantee Fund

The EFSI Guarantee Fund is managed according to the principle that the assets shall have a sufficient
degree of liquidity and mobilisation in relation to the relevant commitments. The portfolio is composed of
liquid assets that can be sold to meet short-term cash outflows if necessary. In addition the share of
cash, cash equivalents and securities maturing within 1 year is 23 %.

The settlement of derivative contracts is gross and is based on their contractual maturity. Obligations are
honoured via sales of USD-denominated assets and/or a swap transaction, whereby it is possible that a
cash outflow arises due to foreign exchange differences.

No liquidity management is necessary with regard to collateral / margin requirements as the current
hedging counterparty accepts to operate with the Commission without any requirements for collateral /
margin calls.

EFSD Guarantee Fund

The EFSD Guarantee Fund is managed according to the principle that the assets shall have a sufficient
degree of liquidity and mobilisation in relation to the relevant commitments.

The portfolio is composed of liquid assets that can be sold to meet short-term cash outflows, if necessary.
In addition the share of cash, cash equivalents and securities maturing within 1 year is 42 %.

Other financial instruments – derivative financial liabilities

In 2017, the EU entered into a derivative contract (foreign exchange option) covering the devaluation of
foreign exchange currency related to loans given by financial institutions under Eastern Partnership SME
Finance Facility programme (see note 2.11.2). Moreover, the EU guarantee on equity portfolios held by
the EIB Group led to a financial obligation to cover changes in the value or impairments of underlying
investments. As for the other financial instruments financed by the EU Budget, the amount for which the
EU is liable under these instruments cannot exceed the amount committed, being the liquidity risk
mitigated by that fact.

                                  Annual accounts of the European Union 2019


8.         EVENTS AFTER THE BALANCE SHEET DATE
The annual accounts and related notes were prepared using the most recently available information and
this is reflected in the information presented above. At the date of signature of these accounts two key
material matters are disclosed below, the departure of the United Kingdom from the European Union and
the EU reaction to the coronavirus outbreak. No further material issues had come to the attention of or
were reported to the Accounting Officer of the Commission that would require separate disclosure under
this section.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)

During the first half of 2020, the coronavirus outbreak has had huge global impacts. As a non-adjusting
event, the outbreak of the coronavirus does not require any adjustments to the figures reported. For
subsequent reporting periods, the implementation of the immediate response initiatives proposed by the
Commission (including the reactivation of the Emergency Support Instrument (ESI) and further
reinforcement of the Union Civil Protection Mechanism (UCPM/rescEU), the Coronavirus Response
Investment Initiative (CRII and CRII+) and the support to mitigate Unemployment Risks in an
Emergency (SURE) following the COVID-19 outbreak) will affect the recognition, measurement or
reclassification of some assets and liabilities in the financial statements:

     •   Activation of the Emergency Support Instrument (ESI) and further reinforcement of the Union
         Civil Protection Mechanism (UCPM/rescEU):

         Given the depth of the crisis following the COVID-19 outbreak as well as the extent and nature of
         the needs requiring support from the EU budget, the EU reactivated the ESI instrument. This
         instrument, originally established in March 2016 to address the emergency situation which had
         arisen following the massive influx of refugees in Greece (see Council Regulation (EU) 2016/369
         of 15 March 2016), has been reactivated for a period of 3 years (2020-22) to finance expenditure
         necessary to address the COVID‐19 pandemic for the period 1 February 2020 to 31 January 2022
         (see Council regulation (EU) 2020/521 of 14 April 2020). To further this objective, the 2020
         budget was amended to include EUR 2.7 billion in commitment appropriations and EUR 1.4 billion
         in payment appropriations (see Definitive Adoption (EU, Euratom) 2020/537 of Amending budget
         No 2 of the European Union for the financial year 2020 of 17 April 2020). The reactivation will
         allow the Union to deploy measures preventing and mitigating severe consequences in one or
         more Member States and to address in a coordinated manner the needs related to the COVID-19
         disaster, by complementing any assistance provided under other EU instruments. The instrument
         is centrally managed by the Commission and mainly focuses on direct procurement and grants,
         whilst in certain cases actions will be implemented through partners such as international
         organisations.

         As a complementary measure to the ESI, the Union Civil Protection Mechanism/rescEU was
         reinforced to allow wider stock-piling and coordination of essential resource distribution across
         Europe (see Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2019/570, as amended by Commission
         Implementing Decision 2020/414 of 19 March 2020 and Commission Implementing Decision (EU)
         2020/452 of 26 March 2020). To this purpose the 2020 budget was amended to include a further
         EUR 0.3 billion in commitment appropriations and EUR 0.2 billion in payment appropriations. The
         reinforcement of the UCPM/rescEU will support Member States in purchasing some of the needed
         equipment (including therapeutics, medical equipment, Personal Protective Equipment, laboratory
         supplies), thus increasing the volume as well as complementing and widening the scope of
         priority items purchased through the joint procurement under the Joint Procurement Agreement,
         a coordinated approach giving Member States a strong position when negotiating with the
         industry on availability and price of medical products. The rescEU direct grants will provide 100 %
         financing from the EU budget, which includes full financing for development of these capacities
         and full financing of deployment of equipment. The equipment purchased will be hosted by one or
         more Member States, while decision making is organised at EU level, providing emergency
         supplies over and beyond national stocks. It will be available to all Member States and will be
         used in case of insufficient national availability.

     •   Coronavirus Response Investment Initiative (CRII and CRIIplus):

         CRII, implemented by Regulation 2020/460 of the European Parliament and the Council of 30
         March 2020, introduced specific measures to mobilise investments in the healthcare systems of
         Member States and in other sectors of their economies in response to the COVID-19 outbreak by
         providing immediate liquidity to accelerate up to EUR 37 billion of European public investment,


                                                     92

                                               Annual accounts of the European Union 2019

             introducing flexibility in applying EU spending rules and extending the scope of the EU Solidarity
             Fund. CRIIplus, implemented by Regulation 2020/558 of the European Parliament and the Council
             of 23 April 2020, introduced further measures to provide exceptional flexibility for the use of the
             European Structural and Investments Funds. The 2019 balance sheet includes EUR 6.8 billion as
             current pre-financing since these amounts were originally intended to be recovered during 2020.
             However, as a consequence of the CRII, the amounts will now remain with the Member States so
             as to be used to accelerate investments related to the COVID-19 outbreak. As the CRII foresees
             the clearance or recovery of pre-financing at closure, and eligibility periods may end in 2022, this
             EUR 6.8 billion of current pre-financing will likely all be reclassified, in conformity with the
             accounting rules, to non-current in the 2020 financial statements.

       •     European instrument for temporary Support to mitigate Unemployment Risks in an Emergency
             (SURE) following the COVID-19 outbreak:

             As part of its emergency support package to tackle the economic impact of the COVID-19 crisis,
             the EU adopted on 19 May 2020 Council Regulation (EU) 2020/672 establishing the SURE
             instrument to help workers keep their jobs during the crisis. SURE is a temporary scheme which
             can provide up to EUR 100 billion of financial assistance (loans under favourable terms) to
             Member States. The instrument enables Member States to request EU financial assistance to help
             finance the sudden and severe increases of national public expenditure, as from 1 February 2020,
             related to national short-time work schemes and similar measures, including for self-employed
             persons, or to some health-related measures, in particular at the work place in response to the
             crisis. To enable the EU to provide financial assistance under SURE, the Commission shall be
             empowered to borrow on the capital markets or with financial institutions on behalf of the EU to a
             maximum amount of EUR 100 billion. SURE loans will be backed by the EU budget and
             guarantees provided by Member States according to their share in the EU's GNI. The total
             amount of guarantees will be EUR 25 billion and the instrument will become active only when all
             guarantees have been provided. The instrument is limited until 31 December 2022.

       •     Next Generation EU:

             Furthermore, on 27 May 2020 President von der Leyen presented a new proposal for the EU long-
             term budget (multiannual financial framework) 2021-2027 and sectoral programmes boosted by
             ‘Next Generation EU’ 13, an emergency temporary recovery instrument, to help repair the
             immediate economic and social damage brought about by the coronavirus pandemic, kickstart
             the recovery and prepare for a better future for the next generation. This proposal is currently
             being discussed with Member States and the European Parliament. Should an agreement be
             reached based on this proposal, many EU budget programmes would be topped-up by funds
             raised through borrowings by the EU. Given the size of the proposed amounts, it would have a
             significant impact on the content of future EU balance sheets; the specific impact can only be
             assessed once the final proposal has been approved by the budget authority and its
             implementation starts.

Departure of United Kingdom from the European Union

On 1 February 2020 the United Kingdom ceased to be a Member State of the European Union. Following
the conclusion of the Agreement on the withdrawal of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern
Ireland from the European Union and the European Atomic Energy Community (the ‘Withdrawal
Agreement’) between the two parties, the United Kingdom committed to pay all its obligations under the
current MFF and previous financial perspectives following from its membership of the Union.

At the date of signature of these accounts, and based on the Withdrawal Agreement concluded and
already in operation, there is no financial impact to be reported in these accounts.

                                 Annual accounts of the European Union 2019

The objective of this Financial Statement Discussion and Analysis (FSDA) is to assist readers to
understand the financial position, financial performance and cash flows presented in the consolidated
financial statements of the EU. The information presented in this FSDA has not been audited.


1.        CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF
          THE EU: FINANCIAL SITUATION 2019

1.1.      REVENUE

The consolidated revenue of the EU incorporates amounts related to exchange transactions and
non-exchange transactions, the latter being the most significant.

Five-year trend of revenue from main non-exchange transactions (in EUR million)




As budget revenue should equal (or exceed) budget expenditure, the main driver in the revenue trend
shown above is the payments made each year.

In 2019, the consolidated revenue amounted to EUR 160.3 billion, a slight decrease of EUR 2.6 billion or
1.6 % from the previous year figure of EUR 162.9 billion, which was mainly due to an increase in GNI and
VAT resources being overcompensated by a decrease in other revenue categories:

     •   Revenue from GNI (gross national income), the primary element of the EU’s operating revenue,
         and VAT resources increased from EUR 123.4 billion in 2018 to EUR 126.9 billion in 2019. The
         increase of EUR 3.5 billion or 2.8 % was primarily caused by adjustments made for past amounts
         (mainly for the years 2012 to 2017) as GNI/VAT bases were updated with real data.

     •   The increase in recovery of expenses from EUR 2.2 billion to EUR 2.6 billion (an increase of
         EUR 0.4 billion or 18.2%) further contributed to an increase in revenues.

     •   At the same time, revenue from fines, which amounted to EUR 6.7 billion in 2018, fell by
         EUR 2.4 billion or 35.8 % to EUR 4.3 billion due to the lower magnitude of the amount of fines
         imposed. Whereas in 2018 the three biggest fines imposed amounted to EUR 5.7 billion, the three
         biggest cases in 2019 amounted to EUR 3.1 billion.

The above changes were accompanied by a decrease in revenue from traditional own resources, which
fell from EUR 22.8 billion in 2018 to EUR 21.2 billion in 2019 (a decrease of EUR 1.6 billion or 7.0%) and
the decrease in financial revenue, which fell from EUR 3.1 billion in 2018 to EUR 1.8 billion in 2019 (a
decrease of EUR 1.3 billion or 41.9 %), due to a late payment interest revenue related to UK TOR cases
which was recognised in 2018 (EUR 1.3 billion).

1.2.     EXPENSES

The main component of expenses recognised in the consolidated financial statements is transfer
payments under the shared management mode, which includes the following funds: (i) European
Agricultural Guarantee Fund (EAGF), (ii) European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) and
other rural development instruments, (iii) European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) & Cohesion Fund
(CF), and (iv) European Social Fund (ESF). These funds made up 66.8 % of total expenses in 2019
(2018: 66.3 %) – the split can be found in the chart below:

Relative weight of the main expenses implemented by the Member States (shared management) for the
financial year of 2019




Expenses incurred under direct management represent the budget implementation by the Commission,
executive agencies and by trust funds. Under indirect management the budget is implemented by EU
agencies, EU bodies, third countries, international organisations and other entities.

Expenses incurred under direct and indirect management made up EUR 29.0 billion or 18.7 % of total
expenses and remained stable compared to the previous financial year (2018: EUR 28.5 billion or
19.1 %).

The EU recognises certain future payment obligations as expenses even if they are not yet shown in the
cash-based budgetary accounts. Significant amounts are shown under payables and accrued charges
concerning agriculture and rural development and also under pension and employee benefits liabilities
relating to pension and other post-employment rights acquired by Commissioners, Members of the EU
institutions and staff (see note 2.9).

Overall, expenses increased by 4.4 % or EUR 6.5 billion from EUR 149.0 billion to EUR 155.5 billion when
compared with 2018, mainly resulting from expenses from programmes implemented under shared
management by Member States which rose by EUR 4.8 billion or 4.7 % from EUR 101.7 billion to
EUR 106.5 billion led by implementation of programmes under ERDF & Cohesion fund as the current MFF
advances.

1.3.      ASSETS

The most significant items on the asset side of the balance sheet relate to financial assets (loans given,
available for sale financial assets, cash) and pre-financing amounts, which make up 79.6 % of the assets
of the EU (2018: 78.8 %)

Composition of the consolidated assets of the EU




As at 31 December 2019 the total assets were EUR 178.9 billion, reflecting an increase of EUR 4.5 billion
or 2.6 % over the previous year (2018: EUR 174.4 billion). The key changes were:

   •    an increase of EUR 3.0 billion (19.2 %) in available for sale financial assets reflecting the
        continued funding of the EFSI & EFSD guarantee funds, as well as Horizon 2020;

   •    an increase of EUR 1.6 billion (9.0 %) in cash and cash equivalents (see below);

    •   pre-financing, i.e. advances paid to beneficiaries of EU funds, remained essentially stable with a
        slight increase of EUR 1.1 billion (2.5 %);

    •   the above effects were partially compensated by a decrease of EUR 1.3 billion (2.3 %) in loans
        mainly due to the repayment of BOP loans by Romania (EUR 1 billion) and Latvia (EUR 0.5 billion)
        during 2019, the effect of which was partially offset by new MFA loans.

In general, the EU institutions and bodies strive to keep the amounts held as cash and cash equivalents
at a low level. The cash balance of EUR 19.7 billion at year-end is made up of the following main
elements:

   •    An amount of EUR 2.6 billion of fines imposed by the Commission for breach of competition rules,
        definitively cashed in 2019 and not yet included in an amending budget is included in the
        year-end treasury balance.

   •    The treasury balance also includes not yet used assigned revenue and other payment
        appropriations of EUR 9.7 billion of the 2019 budget.

Pre-financing

It should be noted that the level of pre-financing is significantly influenced by the MFF cycle – for
example at the beginning of an MFF period one can expect large advances to be paid to Member States
under cohesion policy and these amounts remain available to the Member States until closure of the
programmes. An annual pre-financing is also paid out, which must be used within the year or be
recovered the following year as part of the annual closure of the accounts cycle. The Commission makes
every effort to ensure that the levels of pre-financing are maintained at an appropriate level. A balance
has to be struck between ensuring sufficient funding for the projects and the timely recognition of
expenditure.

The total pre-financing (excluding other advances to Member States and contributions to the trust funds
Bêkou and Africa) on the EU balance sheet amounts to EUR 44.4 billion (2018: EUR 43.4 billion), almost
all of which relates to Commission activities. Some 56 % of the Commission's pre-financing concerns
shared management, which means that the implementation of the budget is delegated to Member States
(the Commission retains a supervisory role).

Commission pre-financing by management mode




The most significant pre-financing amount under the shared management mode relates to ERDF &
Cohesion Fund (EUR 14.4 billion), which is at a similar level to 2018 (EUR 14.6 billion).

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The following items are shown in accounting terms as financial instruments in the consolidated financial
statements of the EU:

   •   Financial Instruments financed by the EU budget: under this type of budget implementation funds
       are either already disbursed to the fiduciary accounts managed by the entrusted entities and stay
       available (as cash and cash equivalents, debt securities or investment in money market funds or
       pooled portfolios of assets) to cover future guarantee calls or have been invested in equity;

   •   Financial assets held in guarantee funds for budgetary guarantees: under this type of budget
       implementation the EU provides guarantees to counterparts for which the funding is only partially
       provisioned via guarantee funds set-up by the Commission and thus creating contingent liabilities
       for the EU budget – see note 4.1; and

   •   Loans and related borrowings for financial assistance programmes.

Financial instruments financed by the EU budget

The significance and volume of financial instruments financed by the EU budget under direct and indirect
management increases from year to year. The basic concept behind this approach, in contrast to the
traditional method of budget implementation of giving grants and subsidies, is that for each euro spent
from the budget via financial instruments, the final beneficiary receives more than EUR 1 as financial

support due to the leverage effect. This use of the EU budget aims at maximising the impact of the funds
available. Financial instruments financed by the EU budget exist in the form of guarantee instruments,
equity instruments and loan instruments – see the overview by MFF in the below table. Assets held in
these instruments are either kept in cash and cash equivalents or invested in equity instruments and debt
securities categorised as available for sale financial assets in the consolidated financial statements of the
EU.

Financial assets held in guarantee funds for budgetary guarantees

The Commission has set up guarantee funds to cover budgetary guarantees given to the EIB group and
other financial institutions (see note 4.1.1 of the consolidated financial statements). These guarantee
funds are provisioned by payments from the EU budget so as to provide a liquidity cushion against
potential losses from guaranteed operations. Payments to the guarantee funds are invested in financial
instruments including debt securities, money market funds, cash and term deposits.
At 31 December 2019, the Commission holds financial assets in the:

     •    Guarantee Fund for external actions of EUR 2.6 billion;

     •    EFSI Guarantee Fund of EUR 6.7 billion; and

     •    EFSD Guarantee Fund of EUR 0.6 billion.

Loans and related borrowings for financial assistance programmes

Financial support for Member States and third countries in the form of bilateral loans financed from the
capital markets with the guarantee of the EU budget is provided by the Commission under decisions of
the European Parliament and of the Council.

The Commission, acting on behalf of the EU, currently operates three main programmes:

     •    European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism (EFSM);
     •    Balance of Payments (BOP) assistance; and
     •    Macro-financial assistance (MFA), under which it may grant loans.

The capital required to fund the EU lending is raised on the capital markets or with financial institutions.

At 31 December 2019, the nominal amount of the loans granted for financial assistance under the EFSM
and BOP were:

                                                                                                                 EUR billion

EFSM

EFSM was created to provide financial assistance to all Member States experiencing or seriously
threatened by a severe economic financial disturbance caused by exceptional occurrences beyond their
control. The EFSM was used to provide financial assistance, conditional on the implementation of reforms,
to Ireland and Portugal between 2011 and 2014.

This programme expired and no additional loans can be drawn, though it remains in place for specific
tasks such as the lengthening of maturities for loans to Ireland and Portugal and providing bridging loans.

The main points of the EFSM programme are as follows:

Ireland

     •    Ireland requested the full total of EUR 22.5 billion granted by the EFSM in December 2010. This
          amount was disbursed in eight instalments between January 2011 and March 2014.

     •    In 2019, no repayments of principal were scheduled. All requested interests payments were fully
          made on time.

                                                               104
-----------------------Page 107 End-----------------------

                                  Annual accounts of the European Union 2019

Portugal


   •   Portugal has requested EUR 24.3 billion from a total of EUR 26 billion granted by the EFSM in May
       2011. This amount was disbursed in seven instalments between May 2011 and November 2014.


   •   As in the case of Ireland, there were no scheduled repayments of principal in 2019 and all the
       interests payments have been fully made on time.


   •   Portugal has formally requested that the EU waives its rights under the ’mandatory prepayment
       clause‘ of the EFSM Loan Facility Agreement, to allow Portugal to repay in advance an amount of
       EUR 2 billion to the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF). An early repayment to the EFSF
       triggers a mandatory proportionate repayment of EFSM loans. A Commission Decision has
       authorised the waiver subject to some specific conditions.

BOP

The BOP is an assistance programme designed for countries outside the euro area that are experiencing
or are threatened by difficulties regarding their balance of payments. BOP assistance takes the form of
medium-term loans that are conditional on the implementation of policies designed to address underlying
economic problems. Typically, balance of payments assistance from the EU is offered in cooperation with
the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and other international institutions or countries.

The main points are as follows:

   •   During 2019, the beneficiary Member States of BOP have reimbursed on time and in full a total
       amount of EUR 1.5 billion out of which EUR 1.0 billion related to a capital reimbursement from
       Romania and EUR 0.5 billion capital reimbursement from Latvia. In addition, both Member States
       paid the amount of interest due in 2019 on time.

   •   The outstanding amount at end 2019 is EUR 0.2 billion relating only to Latvia and scheduled for
       repayment in 2025. Romania has repaid all principal and interest so its BOP financial assistance
       programme can be closed.

MFA

The MFA is a form of financial aid extended by the EU to partner countries outside the EU experiencing a
balance of payments crisis. It takes the form of medium/long-term loans or grants, or a combination of
these, and is only available to countries benefiting from a disbursing IMF programme.

As at 31 December 2019, the total outstanding loan volume under the MFA loan programme (nominal
value) thus stood at EUR 4.7 billion.

The main points are as follows:

   •   In 2019 new loans were disbursed for a total amount of EUR 0.4 billion, being EUR 0.3 billion to
       Tunisia, EUR 0.1 billion to Jordan and EUR 0.02 billion to Moldova.

The largest loan beneficiary under MFA is Ukraine, which has been granted loans to the amount of
EUR 3.3 billion, and another EUR 0.5 billion has been committed under a loan agreement but not yet
disbursed. All payment obligations were honoured throughout the year 2019 by Ukraine.

1.4.      LIABILITIES

The most significant items on the liability side of the balance sheet consist primarily of four items: (i)
pension obligation and other employee benefits liabilities; (ii) borrowings; (iii) payables to third parties
and (iv) accrued charges.

Composition of the liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet of the EU




As at 31 December 2019 the total liabilities were EUR 251.5 billion, an increase of EUR 15.6 billion or
6.6 % compared to the previous year (EUR 235.9 billion).
The key changes were related to the following effects:
    •   Pensions and other post-employee benefits increased by EUR 17.2 billion or 21.4 %. The increase
        is mainly due to the actuarial loss from financial assumptions caused by the significant decrease
        in the discount rate which became negative for the first time;
    •   Borrowings decreased by EUR 1.3 billion or 2.4 %, mainly due to the repayment of BOP loans
        (EUR 1 billion relating to Romania and EUR 0.5 billion to Latvia), and partly offset by new MFA
        loans amounting to EUR 0.4 billion;
    •   Looking at payables (decrease of EUR 5.0 billion) and accrued charges (increase of EUR 4.0
        billion) together, the overall level of liabilities remains the same. As the same level of cost claims
        have not been received by year-end in the field of cohesion policy (ERDF, CF and ESF), this leads
        to payables being lower; however accrued charges will increase, indicating that the
        implementation of the programmes is progressing.

Total cost claims and invoices received and recognised under the payables heading of the balance sheet

Net assets

The excess of liabilities over assets does not mean that the EU institutions and bodies are in financial
difficulties, rather it means that certain liabilities will be funded by future annual budgets. Many expenses
are recognised under accrual accounting rules in the current year although they may be actually paid in
the following or later years and funded using future budgets; the related revenues will only be accounted
for in future periods. The most significant amounts to be highlighted are the EAGF activities (the bulk of
which is usually paid in the first quarter of the following year) and the employee benefits liability (to be
paid over the next 30 plus years).



2.        MANAGEMENT OF RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES
          OF EU BUDGET IMPLEMENTATION

2.1.      MACRO-ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT

Given the current global situation concerning the spread of the coronavirus disease during the first
quarter of 2020, it is not possible to accurately assess its undoubted significant negative impact on the
EU macro-economic environment at the time of transmission of these accounts.

The macro-economic environment of the EU has an impact on the ability of EU Member states to meet
their funding obligations towards the EU institutions and bodies and thus on the ability of the EU to
continue implementing EU policies.

Euro area and EU GDP is estimated to have grown by 1.2 % and 1.5 % in 2019, respectively. The overall
inflation in the Euro area averaged 1.2 % in 2019, a sharp decline from the previous year’s inflation rate
of 1.7 %, which can be linked to the fall in energy prices and the lack of pass-through from robust wage
growth to core inflation. The euro area labour market proved to be fairly resilient in 2019 given the
background of relatively moderate economic growth. The unemployment rate has stayed close to or at
7.4% towards the end of the year, which is the lowest rate recorded since May 2008. In December 2019,
the number of unemployed persons was 4.6% lower than one year before and 36.8% below the April
2013 peak.


2.2.      BUDGETARY CONTINGENT LIABILITIES FOR
          FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE

The EU borrowing and lending activities for financial assistance programmes are non-budget operations.
In general, funds raised are on-lent back-to-back to the beneficiary country, i.e. with the same coupon,
maturity and amount. Notwithstanding the back-to-back methodology, the debt service of the funding
instruments is a legal obligation of the EU, which will ensure that all payments are made fully and in
a timely manner. The Commission has put procedures in place to ensure the repayment of borrowings
even in case of a loan default.

Borrowings of the EU constitute direct and unconditional obligations of the EU and are guaranteed by the
EU Member States (budgetary contingent liabilities). Borrowings undertaken to fund loans to countries
outside the EU are covered by the Guarantee Fund for external actions. Should a beneficiary Member
State default, the debt service will be drawn from the available treasury balance of the Commission, if
possible. If that would not be possible, the Commission would draw the necessary funds from the
Member States. EU Member States are legally obliged, according to the EU own resources legislation
(Article 14 of Council Regulation 2014/609), to make available sufficient funds to meet the EU’s
obligations. Thus investors are only exposed to the credit risk of the EU, not to that of the beneficiary of
loans funded. ’Back-to-back' lending ensures that the EU budget does not assume any interest rate or
foreign exchange risk.

For each country programme, the EP, the Council and the Commission decisions determine the overall
granted amount, the number of instalments to be disbursed, and the maximum (average) maturity of the
loan package. Subsequently, the Commission and the beneficiary country agree the loan/funding
parameters, in particular the maturity of instalments. In addition, except for the first one, all instalments
of the loan depend on compliance with policy conditions, in the context of a joint EU/IMF financial
assistance, which is another factor influencing the timing of funding operations. This implies that the

timing and maturities of issuances are dependent on the related EU lending activity. Funding is
exclusively denominated in euro and the maturity spectrum is from 3 to 30 years.

outstanding EFSM and BOP loan amounts at 31 December 2019:

The Inter-governmental financial stability mechanisms European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) and
European Stability Mechanism (ESM) are outside the EU Treaty framework and thus not included in the
consolidated annual accounts of the EU.


2.3.      BUDGETARY GUARANTEES

The EU has given the EIB Group guarantees on loans granted outside of the EU and on debt and equity
operations covered by the EFSI guarantee. At 31 December 2019, the EU discloses in the notes to its
consolidated financial statements (see note 4.1.1) contingent liabilities for both guarantees, while the
amounts constituting present obligations are recognised as provisions and financial guarantee liabilities in
the financial statements (see respectively notes 2.10 and 2.11.3 of the consolidated financial
statements). In order to mitigate the risk that guarantee calls by the EIB Group could have on the EU
budget, the EU has created dedicated guarantee funds, i.e. the Guarantee Fund for external actions and
the EFSI Guarantee Fund.

The Guarantee Fund for external actions is provisioned by the EU budget so as to cover 9 % of the
guaranteed loans outstanding at year-end for EIB external lending mandate activities to third countries.
At 31 December 2019, the total asset value of EUR 2.6 billion covers an exposure of amounts disbursed
of EUR 20.2 billion.

The EFSI Guarantee Fund started its activity in 2016. Pursuant to the amended EFSI Regulation
(Regulation EU 2017/2396) the EFSI EU guarantee ceiling was increased to EUR 26 billion (from the initial
EUR 16 billion) and the boundary for the guarantee fund decreased to 35 % (from the initial 50 %) of the
total EU guarantee obligation. Therefore, the EFSI Guarantee Fund is now expected to reach a total
amount of EUR 9.1 billion. The total assets that make up the EFSI Guarantee Fund at 31 December 2019
is EUR 6.7 billion and that covers an exposure of disbursed amounts of EUR 17.7 billion.

                                 Annual accounts of the European Union 2019

Pursuant to EFSD Regulation (Regulation EU 2017/1601), the EFSD Guarantee of up to EUR 1.5 billion
(further increased by external contributions) is to be made available to support investments in partner
countries in Africa and in the European Neighbourhood. The EU discloses the EFSD Guarantee in the
notes to its consolidated financial statements (see note 4.1.1) as a contingent liability. As at
31 December 2019, one EFSD guarantee agreement was effective, for a total cover limit of
EUR 50 million, but no underlying operations were signed by the implementing partner. The EFSD
Guarantee Fund has been established in order to cover potential future guarantee calls. Total
contributions received into the fund as at 31 December 2019 amount to EUR 0.6 billion.


2.4.      NEW ENTRANTS' RESERVE (NER) 300

The NER 300 fund originated from the sale of the Emission Trading Scheme allowances based on
Directive 2003/87/EC establishing a system for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading within the
Union. The fund belongs to the Member States who use the money to finance innovative low-carbon
energy demonstration projects. The Commission manages the programme on behalf of the Member
States, while the EIB is responsible for the asset management of the NER 300 Fund and acts as a
technical advisor, under the Cooperation Agreement with the Commission. Given the limited role of the
Commission in the decision-making process in NER 300 programme and the fact that the funds arising
from the sale of the allowances are not due to the EU Budget, the NER 300 is excluded from the EU scope
of consolidation (i.e. neither the revenues from the allowances nor the expenses for the projects financed
are included in the EU accounts).

In 2017, the Member States decided (Commission Decision (EU) 2017/2172) that the NER 300 revenues,
which were not fully used for low-carbon energy demonstration projects through grants, should be
partially chanelled through financial instruments. In particular, NER 300 funds are used to provide
guarantee to the EIB in relation to their loans for energy demonstration projects, in addition to the EU
budget guarantee under H2020 and CEF financial instruments. Although those NER 300 funds have been
pooled by the EIB together with the EU budget funds for asset management purposes, they continue to
constitute an integral part of the NER 300 programme and the EU did not obtain control over them.
Hence, the EU recognises only its share in those asset portfolios as available for sale financial assets (see
note 2.4.1 of the consolidated financial statements).

The remaining NER 300 assets, not having been deployed for the low-carbon energy demonstration
projects, shall - according to the Directive 2003/87/EC as amended in 2018 by the Directive (EU)
2018/410 - be used for innovation support in low-carbon technologies and processes, in addition to a
pool of allowances that are to be made available for creation of an ‘Innovation Fund’. Following the
Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/856, the Innovation Fund shall be managed by the
Commission and the contribution from NER 300 when transferred to the EU budget will constitute
external assigned revenue. Given that the Innovation Fund has not started its activities, nor have the
NER 300 unused funds been transferred to the Commission in 2019, those funds have not been
recognised as assets in the 2019 EU consolidated financial statements.

The budget result of the EU is returned to the Member States in 2020 through deduction of their amounts
due. It is calculated in accordance with Article 1(1) of Council Regulation No 608/2014 laying down
implementing measures for the system of own resources. More information can be found under
Calculation of the budget result.

      a.   Revenue for the financial year: refers to table 3.1 “Summary of the implementation of EU Budget
           Revenue”, column 8 “Total Revenue”.

      b.   Payments against current year appropriations: refer to table 4.3 “MFF – Implementation of
           Payment appropriations”, column 2 “Payments made from adopted budget and column 4
           “Payments made from assigned revenue”.

      c.   Payment appropriations carried over to year N+1: refer to table 4.3 “MFF – Implementation of
           Payment appropriations”, column 7 automatic carry-overs plus column 8 carry-over by decision.

      d.   Cancellation of unused payment appropriations carried over from year N-1: takes into account
           the amount of payment appropriations carried over (automatically and on decision) at the end of
           previous year and current year’s “Payments made from carryovers” as in column 3 of table 4.3
           “MFF – Implementation of Payment appropriations”.

      e.   Evolution of the total assigned revenue appropriations at year-end: calculates the difference of
           the amount of assigned revenue appropriations at the end of previous year (plus) and the
           amount of assigned revenue appropriations at the end of the current year (as in column 9 of
           table 4.3 “MFF – Implementation of Payment appropriations” - minus) to obtain the net variation
           of assigned revenue in the current year.

      f.   Exchange rate differences include realised and non-realised exchange rate differences.

NOTES TO THE BUDGETARY IMPLEMENTATION REPORTS

      THE EU BUDGET FRAMEWORK
The budgetary accounts are kept in accordance with the Financial Regulation (FR). The general budget is
the instrument which provides for and authorises the Union's revenue and expenditure every year, within
the ceilings and other provisions laid down in the Multiannual Financial Framework in line with the
legislative acts concerning multiannual programmes adopted under that framework.

appropriations


The above table shows the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) ceilings at current prices. 2019 was
the penultimate financial year covered by the MFF 2014-2020. The overall ceiling for commitment
appropriations for 2019 was EUR 164 123 million, equivalent to 1.00 % of the EU GNI, whilst the
corresponding ceiling for payment appropriations was EUR 166 709 million, or 1.01 % of the EU GNI valid
throughout the budgetary year 2019.

New flexibility provisions have been agreed for the 2014-2020 MFF. One of the new provisions is a
possibility to transfer unspent margins (up until the caps set by the regulation) under the payment
ceilings to the following years – via the Global Margin for Payments in the framework of the technical
adjustment of the MFF for the following year. Therefore, the unspent amount from 2016
(EUR 13 991 million in current prices), 2017 (EUR 16 414 million in current prices) and 2018
(EUR 210 million out of the calculated EUR 11 386 million due to the capping) was transferred to the
years 2018-2020 and the ceilings of 2016-2020 were adjusted accordingly. On 15 May 2019 the
Commission adopted a Communication on technical adjustment of the financial framework for 2020 in
line with movements in GNI (ESA 2010) (COM(2019)310).

                                  Annual accounts of the European Union 2019

An explanation of the various headings of the MFF is given below:

Heading 1 – Smart and inclusive growth

This heading is divided into two separate, but interlinked components:

1a   Competitiveness for growth and jobs, encompassing expenditure on research and innovation,
     education and training, Connecting Europe Facility, social policy, the internal market and
     accompanying policies.

1b   Economic, social and territorial cohesion, designed to enhance convergence of the least developed
     Member States and regions, to complement the EU strategy for sustainable development outside the
     less prosperous regions and to support inter regional cooperation.

Heading 2 – Sustainable growth: natural resources

Heading 2 includes the common agricultural and fisheries policies, and the environmental measures, in
particular the Life + programme.

Heading 3 – Security and citizenship

Heading 3 (Security and citizenship) reflects the growing importance attached to certain fields where the
EU has been assigned particular tasks – justice and home affairs, border protection, immigration and
asylum policy, public health and consumer protection, culture, youth, information and dialogue with
citizens.

Heading 4 – Global Europe

Heading 4 covers all external action, including development cooperation, humanitarian aid, pre-accession
and neighbourhood instruments. The EDF remains outside of the EU budget and is not part of the MFF.

Heading 5 - Administration

This heading covers administrative expenditure for all institutions, pensions and the European Schools.
For the Institutions other than the Commission, these costs make up the totality of their expenditure.

Heading 6 - Compensations

In accordance with the political agreement that new Member States should not become net-contributors
to the budget at the very beginning of their membership, compensation was foreseen under this heading.
This amount was available as transfers to these Member States to balance their budgetary receipts and
contributions.

Heading 9 – Special instruments

Flexibility mechanisms enable the EU to mobilise the necessary funds to react to unforeseen events such
as crisis and emergency situations. Their scope, financial allocation and operating modalities are provided
for in the MFF regulation and the Interinstitutional Agreement. In the current context of reduced
expenditure, they also ensure that budgetary resources can respond to evolving priorities, so that every
euro is used where it is most needed. Most of the flexibility mechanisms are therefore kept outside the
MFF and the funding can be mobilised above the expenditure ceilings.


1.2. MFF DETAILED HEADINGS (PROGRAMMES)

The headings of the MFF are further broken down into detailed headings, corresponding to the main
spending programmes (e.g. Horizon 2020, Erasmus+ etc.). Underlying legal bases for budget
implementation are adopted at this programme level. Programmes are the commonly used structure for

1.3. ANNUAL BUDGET

Every year, the Commission estimates all the Institutions' revenue and expenditure for the year and
draws up a draft budget which it sends to the budgetary authority. On the basis of this draft budget, the
Council sets out its position, which is then the subject of negotiations between the two arms of the
budgetary authority. The President of the EP declares that the joint draft has been finally adopted, thus
making the budget enforceable. During the year in question, amending budgets are adopted. The task of
executing the budget is mainly the responsibility of the Commission.

The budget structure for the Commission consists of administrative and operational appropriations. The
other Institutions have only administrative appropriations. Furthermore, the budget distinguishes
between two types of appropriations: non-differentiated and differentiated. Non-differentiated
appropriations are used to finance operations of an annual nature (which comply with the principle of
annuality). Differentiated appropriations are used in order to reconcile the principle of annuality with the
need to manage multiannual operations. Differentiated appropriations are split into commitment and
payment appropriations:

-   commitment appropriations: cover the total cost of the legal obligations entered into for the current
    financial year for operations extending over a number of years. However, budgetary commitments for
    actions extending over more than one financial year may be broken down over several years, into
    annual instalments, where the basic act so provides.

-   payment appropriations: cover expenditure arising from commitments entered into in the current
    financial year and/or earlier financial years.

In the accounts, the types of funding are grouped into two main items:

    •       Final adopted budget appropriations; and
    •       Additional appropriations containing:
        –     Carry-overs from previous year (the financial regulation allows for a limited number of cases
              to carry unspent amounts from the previous year into the current year); and
        –     Assigned revenue arising from reimbursements, contributions from third parties/countries to
              EU programmes and work performed for third parties are assigned directly to the
              corresponding expenditure budget lines and constitute the third pillar of funding.

All funding types together form the available appropriations.

1.4. REVENUE

1.4.1.     Own resources revenue

The vast majority of revenue comes from own resources, which consist of the following categories:

(1)      Traditional own resources (TOR): usually account for +/- 14 % of own resource revenue.

(2)      Value added tax (VAT) based resource: usually accounts for around 12 % of own resource
         revenue.

(3)      Gross national income (GNI) based resource: usually accounts for +/- 74 % of own resource
         revenue.

The allocation of own resources is made in accordance with the rules laid down in the Council Decision
No. 2014/335/EU, Euratom of 26 May 2014 on the system of the EU's own resources (ORD 2014). This
decision has entered into force on 1 October 2016 and applied retroactively from 1 January 2014.

The total amount of own resources allocated to the Union to cover annual appropriations for payments
shall not exceed 1.20 % of the sum of all the Member States' GNIs.


1.4.2.     Traditional own resources (TOR)

Traditional own resources (TOR) consist of customs duties (levied on imports from third countries) and
sugar levies (paid by sugar producers to finance expenditure on the sugar common organisation of the
market) levied on economic operators and collected by Member States on behalf of the EU. However,
Member States keep 20 % as a compensation for their collection costs. All established traditional own
resource amounts must be entered in one or other of the accounts kept by the competent authorities:

-     In the ordinary accounts provided for in Article 6(3) of Regulation No 609/2014: all amounts
      recovered or guaranteed.
-     In the separate accounts provided for also in the above mentioned Article: all amounts not yet
      recovered and/or not guaranteed; amounts guaranteed but challenged may also be entered in this
      account.

Traditional own resources must be entered in the Commission's account with the treasury or national
central bank by the Member State at the latest on the first working day following the 19th day of the
second month following the month during which the entitlement was established (or recovered in the
case of the separate account).


1.4.3.     Value added tax (VAT)

Value added tax (VAT) is levied on Member States' VAT bases, which are harmonised for this purpose in
accordance with EU rules. However, the VAT base is capped at 50 % of each Member State’s GNI. The
uniform VAT rate applied is fixed at 0.30 % except for the period 2014-2020 in which the rate of call for
Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden was fixed at 0.15 %.


1.4.4.     Gross national income (GNI)

The resource based on gross national income (GNI) is used to finance the part of the budget not covered
by any other sources of revenue. The same percentage rate is levied on each Member States' GNI, which
is established in accordance with EU rules.

VAT and GNI-based resources are determined on the basis of forecasts of relevant bases made when the
draft budget is being prepared. These forecasts are subsequently revised and updated during the budget
year in question by means of an amending budget. Differences between the amounts due by the Member
States by reference to the actual bases and the sums actually paid on the basis of the (revised) forecasts,
either positive or negative, are called by the Commission from the Member States for the first working
day of June of the second year following the budget year in question. Corrections may still be made to the

                                                   118
-----------------------Page 121 End-----------------------

                                  Annual accounts of the European Union 2019

actual VAT and GNI bases during the subsequent four years, unless a reservation is issued. These
reservations have to be seen as potential claims on the Member States for uncertain amounts as their
financial impact cannot be estimated with accuracy. When the exact amount can be determined, the
corresponding VAT and GNI-based resources are called either in connection with the VAT and GNI
balances exercise or by individual calls for funds.


1.4.5.     UK correction

A budgetary imbalance correction mechanism in favour of the United Kingdom (reducing their own
resource payments while increasing the payments of other Member States) was instituted by the
European Council in Fontainebleau (June 1984). Germany, Austria, Sweden and Netherlands benefit from
a reduced financing of the UK correction (restricted to one quarter of their normal share).


1.4.6.     Gross reduction

The European Council of 7-8 February 2013 concluded that Denmark, the Netherlands and Sweden
should benefit from gross reductions in their annual contributions based on GNI for the period 2014-2020
while Austria only benefited from gross reductions for the period 2014-2016. The annual reductions are
as follows: Denmark EUR 130 million, the Netherlands EUR 695 million and Sweden EUR 185 million.


1.5. CALCULATION OF THE BUDGET RESULT

The budget result of the EU is returned to the Member States during the following year through deduction
of their amounts due for that year.

The amounts of own resources entered in the accounts are those credited during the course of the year
to the accounts opened in the Commission's name by the governments of the Member States. Revenue
comprises also, in the case of a surplus, the budget result for the previous financial year. The other
revenue entered in the accounts is the amount actually received during the course of the year.

For the purposes of calculating the budget result for the year, expenditure comprises payments made
against the year's appropriations plus any of the appropriations for that year that are carried over to the
following year. Payments made against the year's appropriations means payments that are made by the
Accounting Officer by 31 December of the financial year. For the EAGF, payments are those effected by
the Member States between 16 October N-1 and 15 October N, provided that the Accounting Officer was
notified of the commitment and authorisation by 31 January N+1. EAGF expenditure may be subject to a
conformity decision following controls in the Member States.

The budget result comprises two elements: the result of the EU and the result of the participation of the
EFTA countries belonging to the European Economic Area (EEA). In accordance with Article 1(1) of
Regulation No 608/2014 laying down implementing measures for the system of own resources, this result
represents the difference between:

   -     total revenue received for the financial year; and

   -     total payments made against current year's appropriations plus the total amount of that year's
         appropriations carried over to the following year.

The following are added to or deducted from the resulting figure:

   -     the net balance of cancellations of payment appropriations carried over from previous years and
         any payments which, because of fluctuations in the euro rate, exceed non-differentiated
         appropriations carried over from the previous year;

   -     the evolution of assigned revenue; and

   -     the net exchange rate gains or losses recorded during the year.

Appropriations carried over from the previous financial year in respect of contributions by and work for
third parties, which by definition never lapse, are included as additional appropriations for the financial
year. This explains the difference between carryovers from the previous year in the year N budget

                                                    119

                                  Annual accounts of the European Union 2019

implementation reports and those carried over to the following year in the year N-1 budget
implementation reports. Appropriations made available again following the repayment of payments on
account are disregarded when calculating the budget result.

Payment appropriations carried over include: automatic carry-overs and carry-overs by decision. The
cancellation of unused payment appropriations carried over from the previous year shows the
cancellations of appropriations carried over automatically and by decision.

In accordance with the Financial Regulation, the economic result of the year is calculated on the basis of
accrual accounting principles (EU Accounting Rules), while the budget result is based on modified cash
accounting rules. As the economic result and the budget result cover the same underlying transactions –
the exception being the other (non-budgetary) sources of revenue and expenditure of the agencies and
the ECSC in Liquidation which are included in the economic result only (see note 6) – the reconciliation of
the economic result of the year with the budget result of the year serves as a useful consistency check.

Reconciling items - Revenue

The actual budgetary revenue for a financial year corresponds to the revenue collected from entitlements
established in the course of the year and amounts collected from entitlements established in previous
years. Therefore the entitlements established in the current year but not yet collected are to be deducted
from the economic result for reconciliation purposes as they do not form part of budgetary revenue. On
the contrary the entitlements established in previous years and collected in current year must be added
to the economic result for reconciliation purposes.

The accrued revenue mainly consists of accrued revenue for agriculture, own resources, interests and
dividends. Only the net effect, i.e. accrued revenue for current year minus reversal accrued revenue from
previous year, is taken into consideration.

Reconciling items - Expenditure

The accrued expenses mainly consists of accruals made for year-end cut-off purposes, i.e. eligible
expenses incurred by beneficiaries of EU funds but not yet reported to the Commission. Only the net-
effect, i.e. accrued expenses for current year minus the reversal of accrued expenses from the previous
year, is taken into consideration. Payments made in the current year relating to invoices registered in


                                                    120
-----------------------Page 123 End-----------------------

                                Annual accounts of the European Union 2019

prior years are part of current year's budgetary expenditure and therefore must be added to the
economic result for reconciliation purposes.

The net effect of pre-financing is the combination of (1) the new pre-financing amounts paid in the
current year and recognised as budgetary expenditure of the year and (2) the clearing of the pre-
financing through eligible costs accepted during the current year. The latter represent an expense in
accrual terms but not in the budgetary accounts since the payment of the initial pre-financing had
already been considered as a budgetary expenditure at the time of its payment.

As well as the payments made against the year's appropriations, the appropriations for that year that are
carried forward to the next year also need to be taken into account in calculating the budget result for
the year (in accordance with Article 1(1) of Regulation No 608/2014). The same applies for the budgetary
payments made in the current year from carry-overs from previous years, and the cancellation of unused
payment appropriations.

The movement in provisions relates to year-end estimates made in the financial statements (employee
benefits mainly) that do not impact the budgetary accounts. Other reconciling amounts comprise different
elements such as asset amortisation/depreciation, asset acquisitions, capital lease payments and financial
participations for which the budgetary and accrual accounting treatments differ.

Reconciling item – Economic result Agencies and ECSC in Liquidation

The budget result of the year is a non-consolidated figure and does not include the other (non-budgetary)
sources of revenue and expenditure of the consolidated agencies and the ECSC i.L. (see note 6). To
reconcile the economic result of the year – a consolidated figure which includes these amounts – with the
budgetary result of the year, the whole consolidated economic result of the year of the agencies and the
ECSC i.L. is presented as a reconciling item.

       IMPLEMENTATION OF THE 2019 EU BUDGET –
       COMMENTARY

2.1. REVENUE

In the initial adopted EU budget, signed by the President of the European Parliament on 12 December
2018, the amount of payment appropriations was EUR 148 199 million and the amount to be financed by
own resources totalled EUR 146 305 million. The revenue and expenditure estimates in the initial budget
are typically adjusted during the budgetary year, such modifications being presented in amending
budgets. Adjustments in the GNI-based own resources ensure that budgeted revenue matches exactly
budgeted expenditure. In accordance with the principle of equilibrium, budget revenue and expenditure
(payment appropriations) must be in balance.

During 2019, three amending budgets were adopted. Taking them into account, the final adopted
revenue for 2019 amounted to EUR 148 492 million and the total financed by own resources was
EUR 144 795 million. The main factor for the reduction of Member States' contributions in 2019 was the
surplus from the previous financial year (EUR 1 803 million) slightly counterbalanced by a net increase of
payment appropriations (EUR 293 million).

As far as the own resources result is concerned, the collection of traditional own resources was very close
to the forecasted amounts.

The final Member States' VAT and GNI payments also correspond closely to the final budgetary estimate.
The differences between the forecasted amounts and the amounts actually paid are due to the differences
between the euro rates used for budgetary purposes and the rates in force at the time when the Member
States outside the EMU actually made their payments.

For the VAT    and GNI balances, the rules are set out in Article 10 b of the Making Available Regulation
(Regulation    609/2014). The procedure does not entail a budgetary amendment and therefore the
Commission     directly requests the Member States to pay the net amounts. The impact for the EU budget
was close to   zero due to this netting system.

The heading "Contributions and refunds in connection with EU agreements and programmes" concerns
mainly revenue from financial corrections (ESIF, EAGF and EAFRD), the participation of third countries in
research programmes, the clearance of accounts in agricultural funds and other contributions and refunds
to EU programmes/activities. A substantial part of this total is made up of earmarked revenue, which
typically gives rise to the entering of additional appropriations on the expenditure side. In 2019, these
contributions totalled EUR 12.6 billion.

The revenue from fines relates mainly to fines in the field of competition.


2.2. EXPENDITURE

The EU budget has an important role to support the delivery of the Union's policies and priorities. Despite
its limited amount, representing around 2 % of all public spending in the Union, it complements national
budgets and has a clear focus on investment and additionality. It is a key tool among the wide set of
European-level policy and regulatory instruments, to implement policy priorities which all EU members
have agreed upon, translated into a Multiannual Financial Framework containing the different
programmes and maximum expenditure ceilings.

The EU budget for 2019, adopted on 12 December 2018, confirms that the EU is directing money to
where the needs are. In 2019, and in line with the European Commission proposal of May 2018, the
biggest part of the EU budget went to stimulate the creation of jobs, especially for young people, and to
boost growth, strategic investments and convergence. The EU has also continued supporting the efforts
to effectively deal with the migration challenge, both inside and outside the EU.

2019 was the sixth year of the current 2014-2020 Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF). The
implementation of almost all programmes was at cruising speed except new programmes or actions for
which the legislative process finished recently.

-----------------------Page 125 End-----------------------

                                Annual accounts of the European Union 2019

In line with the annual evolution foreseen in the MFF, appropriations proposed in the draft budget were
set at EUR 165.6 billion (3.1 % higher when compared to the 2018 budget) in commitments, and
EUR 148.7 billion (2.7 % higher) in payments, corresponding to 1.00 % and 0.90 % of EU gross national
income (GNI), respectively.

All headings reached high levels of implementation in 2019. The 2019 implementation for all types of
appropriations (budget, carry-overs from previous year and assigned revenue) was 97 % for
commitments and 93 % for payments. Implementation rates excluding assigned revenue show full
implementation in 2019 (99.4 % in commitments and 98.4 % in payments).

Outstanding commitments (RAL, committed amounts not yet paid for) stood at EUR 297.7 billion at the
end of 2019. An increase from the 2018 level had been expected, given the difference between budgeted
commitment and payment appropriations (EUR 17.7 billion) in the adopted budget and taking into
account the fact that an increase in outstanding commitments constitutes a normal evolution, as
commitment appropriations increase every year as foreseen in the Multiannual Financial Framework. The
final increase reached EUR 16.5 billion.

      The consolidated reports on the implementation of the general budget of the EU include, as in previous years, the budget implementation of all Institutions
      since within the EU budget a separate budget for each Institution is established.

      The budget and implementation of Agencies are not consolidated within the EU budget and are not included in the EU budget reports. The Commission subsidy
      paid to the agencies however is part of the EU budget. In this budgetary part of the annual accounts, only the subsidy paid from the Commission budget to the
      Agencies is taken into consideration.

      Concerning the EEAS, it should be noted that, in addition to its own budget, it also receives contributions from the Commission of EUR 152.7 million (2018:
      EUR 141.7 million) and the EDF and the Trust Funds of EUR 63.1 million (2018: EUR 70.1 million). These contributions cover the costs of Commission's staff in
      the delegations financed under the EDF and the Trust Funds including assigned revenue generated in the year from these contributions. These budget credits
      are put at the disposal of the EEAS (as assigned revenue) to cover primarily the costs of Commission staff working in the EU delegations, these delegations
      being administratively managed by the EEAS.

                                     Annual accounts of the European Union 2019


     IMPLEMENTATION OF THE AGENCIES' BUDGET
The agencies’ revenue and expenditure, as shown in the reports 6.1 and 6.2 below, are not consolidated
as such within the EU budget. In this budgetary part of the annual accounts, only the subsidy paid from
the Commission budget to the Agencies is taken into consideration.

The EU budget implementation reports do indeed include the subsidy paid from the EU budget to the
agencies as commitment and payment appropriations, when applicable.

The agencies’ reports below show an overview of the Agencies, both decentralised (also known as
traditional agencies) and executive agencies, and of their revenue (6.1) and expenditure (6.2).

Other sources of revenue and their related expenditure are not added into the EU budget accounts. Each
agency presents its own set of annual accounts.

GLOSSARY

Actuarial assumptions

Assumptions used to calculate the costs of future events that affect the pension liability.

Actuarial gains and losses

For a defined benefit scheme, the changes in actuarial deficits or surpluses. They arise as a result of
differences between the previous actuarial assumptions and what has actually occurred and due to effects
of changes in actuarial assumptions.

Administrative appropriations

Administrative appropriations cover the running costs of the Institutions and entities (staff, buildings,
office equipment).

Adopted budget

Draft budget becomes the adopted budget as soon as it is approved by the Budgetary Authority.

Amending budget

Decision adopted during the budget year to amend (increase, decrease, transfer) aspects of the adopted
budget of that year.

Amounts to be called from Member States

These represent expenses incurred during the reporting period that will need to be funded by future
budgets, i.e. by the EU Member States. This is a consequence of the co-existence of accruals based
financial statements and a cash based budget.

Annual Activity Report (AAR)

Annual Activity Reports indicate the results of   operations by reference to objectives set, associated risks
and the internal control structure, inter alia.   Since the 2001 budget exercise for the Commission and
since 2003 for all European Union institutions,   the ‘authorising officer by delegation’ must submit an AAR
to his/her institution on the performance of      his/her duties, together with financial and management
information.

Appropriations

Budget funding. The budget forecasts both commitments and payments (cash or bank transfers to the
beneficiaries). Appropriations for commitments and payments often differ (differentiated appropriations)
because multi annual programmes and projects are usually fully committed in the year they are decided
and are paid over the years as the implementation of the programme and project progresses. Non-
differentiated appropriations apply to administrative expenditure, for agricultural market support and
direct payments and commitment appropriations equal payment appropriations.

Assigned revenue

Dedicated revenue received to finance specific items of expenditure. The main source of external
assigned revenue is financial contributions from third countries to programmes financed by the Union.
The main source of internal assigned revenue is revenue from third parties in respect of goods, services
or work supplied at their request; revenue arising from the repayment of amounts wrongly paid and
revenue from the sale of publications and films.

                                      Annual accounts of the European Union 2019

Available for sale financial assets

All financial assets (except derivatives) that are according to International Public Sector Accounting
Standards measured at fair value and for which the changes in fair value are to be recognised in a
reserve in net assets until derecognition (or impairment).

Budget line

As far as the budget structure is concerned, revenue and expenditure are shown in the budget in
accordance with a binding nomenclature which reflects the nature and purpose of each item, as imposed
by the budgetary authority. The individual headings (title, chapter, article or line) provide a formal
description of the nomenclature.

Cancellation of appropriations

Unused appropriations that may no longer be used.

Carryover of appropriations

Exception to the principle of annuality in so far as appropriations that could not be used in a given budget
year may, under strict conditions, be exceptionally carried over for use during the following year.

Commitment

Legal pledge to provide finance subject to certain conditions. The EU commits itself to reimbursing its
share of the costs of an EU funded project. Today’s commitments are tomorrow’s payments. Today’s
payments are yesterday’s commitments.

Commitment appropriation

Commitment appropriations cover the total cost of legal obligations                      (contracts,   grant
agreements/decisions) that could be signed in the current financial year.

Current service cost

The increase in scheme liabilities arising from service in the current financial year.

Decommitment

An act whereby a previous commitment (or part of it) is cancelled.

Defined benefit scheme

A pension or other retirement benefit scheme where the scheme rules define the benefits independently
of the contributions payable, and the benefits are not directly related to the investments of the scheme.
The scheme may be funded or unfunded.

Derivatives

Financial instruments whose value is linked to changes in the value of another financial instrument, an
indicator or a commodity. In contrast to the holder of a primary financial instrument (e.g. a government
bond), who has an unqualified right to receive cash (or some other economic benefit) in the future, the
holder of a derivative has only a qualified right to receive such a benefit. An example of a derivative is
currency forward contract.

Direct management

Mode of budget implementation. Under direct management the budget is implemented directly by
Commission services, Executive Agencies or Trust Funds.

Discount rate

The rate used to adjust for the time value of money. Discounting is a technique used to compare costs
and benefits that occur in different time periods.

                                                        163

                                   Annual accounts of the European Union 2019

Effective interest rate

The rate that discounts estimated future cash receipts or payments over the expected life of the financial
asset or financial liability to the net carrying amount of the asset or liability.

Financial assets or liabilities at fair value through surplus or deficit

All financial assets or liabilities that are according to International Public Sector Accounting Standards
measured at fair value and for which the changes in fair value are to be recognised in surplus or deficit of
the period (i.e. derivatives).

Financial correction

The purpose of financial corrections is to protect the EU budget from the burden of erroneous or irregular
expenditure. For expenditure under shared management, the task of recovering incorrect payments is
primarily the responsibility of the Member State.

A 'confirmed' financial correction has been accepted by the Member State concerned. A 'decided' financial
correction has been adopted by a Commission decision and is always a net correction, where the Member
State is required to reimburse irregular funds to the EU budget, thus leading to a definitive reduction of
the allocated envelope to the Member State concerned. Confirmed and decided financial corrections are
reported in this publication as one category.

An 'implemented' financial correction has corrected the observed irregularity.

Indirect management

Mode of budget implementation. Under indirect management the Commission confers tasks of budget
implementation to bodies of EU law or national law.

Interruptions and suspensions

If the Commission finds, based on its own work or the information reported by audit authorities, that a
Member State has failed to remedy serious shortcomings in the management and control systems and/or
to correct irregular expenditure which had been declared and certified, it may interrupt or suspend
payments.

Irregularity

An irregularity is an act which does not comply with EU rules and which has a potentially negative impact
on EU financial interests, but which may be the result of genuine errors committed either by beneficiaries
claiming funds or by the authorities responsible for making payments. If an irregularity is committed
deliberately, it constitutes fraud.

Lapsing appropriations

Unused appropriations to be cancelled at the end of the financial year. Lapsing means the cancellation of
all or part of the authorisation to make expenditures and/or incur liabilities which is represented by an
appropriation. Only for Joint Undertakings, as specified in their Financial Rules, any unused
appropriations may be entered in the estimate of revenue and expenditure of up to the following three
financial years (the so-called "N+3" rule). Hence, lapsing appropriations for JUs could be reactivated until
financial year "N+3"

Outstanding commitments

As the Reste à Liquider (RAL), they represent the amount where a budgetary commitment has been
made but the subsequent payment is not yet done. They represent payment obligations for the EU for
future years and stem directly from the existence of multi annual programmes and the dissociation
between commitment and payment appropriations.

regulation 609/2014. Own resources comprise GNI-based resources, VAT-based resources and traditional
own resources.

Payment appropriations

Payment appropriations cover expenditure due in the current year, arising from legal commitments
entered in the current year and/or earlier years.

Pre-financing

A payment intended to provide the beneficiary with a float. It may be split into a number of payments in
accordance with the provisions of the underlying contract, decision, agreement or the basic legal act. The
float or advance is either used for the purpose for which it was provided during the period defined in the
agreement or it is repaid.

Preventive measure

Preventive measures, which are at the Commission’s disposal to protect the EU budget when it is aware
of potential deficiencies, include suspensions and interruptions of payments from the EU budget to the
operational programme.

Reste à Liquider (RAL)

As the Outstanding commitments, it represents the amount where a budgetary commitment has been
made but the subsequent payment is not yet done. They represent payment obligations for the EU for
future years and stem directly from the existence of multi annual programmes and the dissociation
between commitment and payment appropriations.

Shared management

Mode of budget implementation. Under shared management budget implementation tasks are delegated
to Member States. About 80 % of the EU expenditure falls under this implementation mode.

Traditional own resources

These represent revenue for the EU and are part of the 'own resources' which fund the activities of the
EU. Traditional own resources are defined in the own resource regulation 609/2014 and comprise
customs duties and sugar levies.

Transfers (between budget lines)

Transfers between budget lines imply the relocation of appropriations from one budget line to another, in
the course of the financial year, and thereby they constitute an exception to the budgetary principle of
specification. They are, however, expressly authorised by the Treaty on the Functioning of the European
Union under the conditions laid down in the Financial Regulation (FR). The FR identifies different types of
transfers depending on whether they are between or within budget titles, chapters, articles or headings
and require different levels of authorisation.
