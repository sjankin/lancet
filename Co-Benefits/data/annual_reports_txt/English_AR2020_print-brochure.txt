THE YEAR IN

REVIEW
In 2020, UNFPA witnessed the greatest humanitarian crisis since the
organization’s creation 52 years ago: the COVID-19 pandemic. This public
health catastrophe brought with it socioeconomic, political and human
rights crises, doubling the global need for humanitarian assistance from
the previous year. Women and girls bore many of the worst impacts.
We saw this in our work. Health systems were strained. Supply chains were
disrupted. Many programmes and services were driven to a halt. Globally,
a United Nations survey found 7 in 10 countries experienced disruptions
in contraceptive services. UNFPA offices reported stark increases in
domestic violence cases and calls for help amid lockdowns and movement
restrictions. Disrupted services and increased vulnerabilities are projected
to result in 2 million more cases of female genital mutilation and an
additional 13 million child marriages within the next decade that would
otherwise have been averted.
But UNFPA rose to the challenge.
With ingenuity and flexibility, we ramped up distribution of personal
protective equipment and training in infectious disease control. Many
disrupted programmes and services were restored, and 74 per cent of
UNFPA programme countries were able to maintain or expand family
planning services at the community level. Ninety-one per cent maintained
or expanded interventions to prevent gender-based violence.
The crisis is far from over. We know the road ahead will be long and hard.
But we also know that we can deliver progress even amid world-shaking
adversity. With solidarity and support, we can transform the future for
women and girls.

THE COVID-19

RESPONSE
The pandemic has had a devastating impact on health systems. More
than 17,000 health workers died from COVID-19 over the course of
2020. Massive health resources and many personnel were diverted
from routine essential care to support the pandemic response.
UNFPA projects 12 million women across 115 low- and middleincome countries experienced contraceptive service disruptions, and
42 per cent of UNFPA programme countries reported facility-level
disruptions in family planning services. Some also reported declines in
institutional deliveries.
Under these extreme circumstances, UNFPA worked to maintain
continuity of sexual and reproductive health care, and to safeguard
those providing this life-saving work. UNFPA mobilized $94.8 million
in additional resources to support the pandemic response, more
than a quarter of which came from United Nations entities. With this,
nearly a half million health workers were trained to respond to the
pandemic, personal protective equipment was delivered to more than
100 countries, and programmes pivoted to restore, sustain or expand
sexual and reproductive health services.

DELIVERING

WORLDWIDE
Despite UNFPA realigning nearly a third of its activities
to better respond to the pandemic, results from 2020
showed a positive trend in achieving its strategic plan
outputs compared to 2019. UNFPA family planning
programmes helped prevent over 14 million unintended
pregnancies, nearly 40,000 maternal deaths, and more
than 4 million unsafe abortions last year.
These figures reflect the agile response UNFPA
was able to summon. As we look forward, UNFPA’s
programming will have to remain robust and adaptive
to the volatile public health and economic conditions
around the world.
