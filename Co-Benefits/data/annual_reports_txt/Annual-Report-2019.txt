    Central to this project would be our ocean, with

    our economies forward and opening up new
    possibilities for our sustainable development.

to Bougainville and New Caledonia were also
conducted.
From the 2030 SDGs, SAMOA Pathway, Paris
Agreement and others, regional approaches to
global sustainable development commitments
became more cohesive in 2019 with the
establishment of a Pacific Sustainable
Development Steering Committee (PSDSC). At its
first meeting the PSDSC confirmed key messages
to support leaders preparing for the 2019 UN
General Assembly Special Summit on the 2030
Agenda. Importantly it is tracking the impact of
regional implementation and identifying where
Pacific development partners and UN agencies

from 2020. This meeting, supported by the CROP
agencies, focussed on linkages between fisheries
issues and trade, economy and the environment.
Fisheries are a key priority for Leaders, and this

Secretary General’s Statement

I am pleased to present the Secretariat’s financial statements and independent auditors’ report
for the year ended 31 December 2019.

During the year, we expended FJD20.4m from General Fund and FJD20m from Trust Fund,
while our total cash and investment holdings at year end amounted to FJD29.8m.

I remain conscious of the responsibility entrusted to the Secretariat by Members of the Pacific
Islands Forum, and by our development partners, to manage such a substantial level of funding.
I therefore reaffirm our commitment to ensure that these financial statements provide an
accountable and transparent summary of the Secretariat’s financial activities for the 2019
financial year.

In my opinion:

(a)     the accompanying General fund statement of comprehensive income is drawn up so as
        to give a true and fair view of the results of the Secretariat for the year ended 31
        December 2019;

(b)     the accompanying statement of financial position is drawn up so as to give a true and
        fair view of the state of the Secretariat’s affairs as at 31 December 2019;

(c)     the accompanying statement of changes in funds is drawn up so as to give a true and
        fair view of the movement in funds of the Secretariat for the year ended 31 December
        2019; and

(d)     the accompanying statement of cash flows is drawn up so as to give a true and fair view
        of the cash flows of the Secretariat for the year ended 31 December 2019.

In light of the COVID-19 outbreak which has impacted the public health and economic systems
globally, since the beginning of the year 2020, the Secretariat has responded to the rapidly
changing environment and associated risks with implementation of strict measures including
staff movement restrictions to duty travel and access to the headquarters by essential staff only,
to mitigate the risks as well as including adhering to the local Government’s protocols and
lockdowns. The Secretariat believes it has sufficient financial resources at this time to continue
in operational existence for the foreseeable future but it will continue to review further the
impact of the outbreak on the organisation’s revenues and expenditures for the future years.

Dated at Suva this               day of                    2020

               Independent Auditor’s Report

               To the Members of Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat

               Report on the audit of the financial statements

               Opinion

               We have audited the accompanying financial statements of Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat (the
               ‘Secretariat’), which comprise the statement of financial position as at 31 December 2019, and the
               general fund statement of comprehensive income, statement of changes in funds and statement of
               cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of
               significant accounting policies.

               In our opinion, the accompanying financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial
               position of the Secretariat as at 31 December 2019, and of its financial performance and cash flows
               for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards.

               Basis for Opinion

               We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs). Our
               responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the
               Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report.

               We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis
               for our opinion.

               Independence

               We are independent of the Secretariat in accordance with the ethical requirements of the
               International Ethics Standards Board for Accountant’s Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants
               (IESBA Code) that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in Fiji, and we have fulfilled
               our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the IESBA Code.

               Other information

               Members and management are responsible for the other information. The other information
               comprises the information included in the Secretariat’s Annual Report for the year ended 31
               December 2019 (but does not include the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon).

               Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express
               any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

               In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other
               information identified above and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially
               inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise
               appears to be materially misstated.




               Financial Statements                             - -                               31 December 2018

                                                                                                             3




If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this
other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard, except
that not all other information was available to us at that date of our signing.

Responsibilities of Members and Management for the Financial Statements

Members and management are responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial
statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards and for such internal
control as the members and management determine is necessary to enable the preparation of
financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, the members and management are responsible for assessing
the Secretariat’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to
going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the members and management
either intend to liquidate the Secretariat or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to
do so.

The members and management are responsible for overseeing the Secretariat’s financial reporting
process.

Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole
are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report
that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee
that an audit conducted in accordance with the ISAs will always detect a material misstatement when
it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or
in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users
taken on the basis of the financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with the ISAs, we exercise professional judgement and maintain
professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:

  Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to
   fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit
   evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not
   detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error,
   as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the
   override of internal control.

  Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit
   procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an
   opinion on the effectiveness of the Secretariat’s internal control.

  Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting
   estimates and related disclosures made by the members and management.




                                           Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat | 2019 Annual Report                43
-----------------------Page 43 End-----------------------

                  Conclude on the appropriateness of the members and managements use of the going concern
                   basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty
                   exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Secretariat’s ability
                   to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required
                   to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or,
                   if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit
                   evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions
                   may cause the Secretariat to cease to continue as a going concern.

                  Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the
                   disclosures, and whether the financial statements represents the underlying transactions and
                   events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

                We communicate with members and management regarding, among other matters, the planned
                scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies
                in internal control that we identify during our audit.

                Restriction on Use

                This report is made solely to the Secretariat’s Members, as a body. Our audit work has been
                undertaken so that we might state to the Members those matters we are required to state to them in
                an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept
                or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Secretariat and the Members as a body, for our
                audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

and contributed to the overall success of the 50th Pacific Islands Forum.


SECURING OUR FUTURE IN THE PACIFIC

4.       Leaders congratulated the Government of Tuvalu for the 50th Pacific Islands Forum
theme – Securing our future in the Pacific – which builds on the themes of the 2018 and 2017
Pacific Islands Forum meetings held in Samoa and Nauru, respectively, and underscores the need

-----------------------Page 51 End-----------------------

     reflecting on this, Leaders noted that securing the future of the Blue Pacific cannot simply be left
     to chance, but rather requires a long-term vision, a carefully considered regionalism strategy, and
     most importantly a collective commitment to achieve it. The strategic value that the Pacific region
     currently holds provides unprecedented opportunities and leverage to realise the Blue Pacific
     Continent.

     6.      In this context, and in promoting the fundamental principle of inclusivity and equality,
     particularly the role of women, ensuring increased representation at all levels, and of youth, for
     advancing regionalism, Leaders endorsed the development of a 2050 Strategy for the Blue Pacific
     Continent, while acknowledging the need for urgent, immediate actions on the threats and
     challenges of climate change facing the Blue Pacific and realising the health and wellbeing of
     Pacific people to secure a bright and prosperous future for the Pacific.

     7.     In framing the development of the 2050 Strategy for the Blue Pacific Continent, Leaders
     agreed the Strategy must ensure social, cultural, environmental and economic integrity,
     sovereignty and security in order to protect people, place and prospects of the Blue Pacific.

     8.     Leaders welcomed the offer by the Prime Minister of Tuvalu to commence dialogue with
     Leaders on a new 2050 vision for Pacific Island countries that recognised the Blue Pacific
     Continent that make up the territories and economic exclusive zones of the region and how Pacific
     Island countries can form an effective union, building on the SAMOA Pathway and the Boe
     Declaration, to ensure a safe and secure future for the Pacific in the face of climate change.

     9.      Leaders agreed that strong political leadership to advance climate change action,
     protecting our Ocean’s health and integrity, sustainably managing our island and ocean resources,
     connecting our oceanic continent (air, sea and ICT) and ensuring healthy people, as cornerstone
     priorities informed by science.

     10.    Leaders tasked the Secretariat to work closely with Members to prepare a draft strategy
     for Leaders’ consideration in Vanuatu in 2020.

     11.     Leaders tasked the review of the regional CROP architecture to re-examine and ensure the
     requisite governance and resourcing arrangements that promote, govern and deepen collective
     responsibility and accountability to deliver the 2050 Strategy for the Blue Pacific Continent.

     12.     Leaders further agreed that in order to secure the Blue Pacific, this would require strong
     political leadership and Members’ commitment to champion priority initiatives to drive and deepen
     regional cooperation, collaboration and integration, under the 2050 Strategy for the Blue Pacific
     Continent.


     PRIORITIES FOR SECURING OUR FUTURE IN THE PACIFIC

     13.     Leaders acknowledged that the Forum’s efforts to advance regionalism under the
     Framework for Pacific Regionalism depends on the solidarity of all the members of the Pacific
     Islands Forum and its efforts to address the regional priorities to secure its Blue Pacific Continent.

            Climate Change and Disaster Resilience

14.     Leaders reaffirmed climate change as the single greatest threat to the livelihoods, security
and wellbeing of the peoples of the Pacific and our commitment to progress the implementation
of the Paris Agreement.

15.     In acknowledging with appreciation the visit of the UN Secretary General to the Pacific
Islands Forum in May 2019, Leaders agreed to build on their Blue Pacific’s Call for Urgent Global
Climate Change Action through the Kainaki II Declaration for Urgent Climate Action Now
(Annex1) as the basis of the Forum’s leadership and moral authority to engage at the UN Secretary
General’s Climate Action Summit and the 25th Conference of the Parties (COP 25) to the UN
Framework Convention on Climate Change.

16.     In recognising the need to formally secure the future of our people in the face of climate
change and its impacts, Leaders noted the proposal for a UN General Assembly Resolution seeking
an advisory opinion from the International Court of Justice on the obligations of States under
international law to protect the rights of present and future generations against the adverse effects
of climate change.

17.     Leaders recognised the value of the ongoing collective efforts as one region and ocean,
and the need to address financing for building resilience in the Blue Pacific. In support of the
decision of Forum Economic Ministers, Leaders 1 endorsed the concept and transitional
arrangements for the establishment of the regionally owned and led Pacific Resilience Facility on
the objectives, governance arrangements, financial products and capitalisation.

18.     Leaders encouraged the Pacific Resilience Facility Technical Working Group to mobilise
the requisite resources from new and existing partners to establish the Pacific Resilience Facility.

19.     Leaders noted the expression of interest by Samoa to host the Pacific Resilience Facility
once it is established as an international organisation.

20.     Leaders also recalled the Framework for Resilient Development in the Pacific (FRDP) and
reaffirmed the importance of a member-driven, inclusive and coordinated action on climate and
disaster resilience. In this respect, Leaders noted the work carried out to date to implement the
FRDP and agreed to extend the trial period on the Pacific Resilient Partnership (PRP) governance
arrangements until 2020 to be informed by a review of the effectiveness and efficiency of the
governance arrangements.

21.    Leaders further directed the PRP taskforce to further elaborate the FRDP in line with the
Paris Agreement, and to finalise the Monitoring & Evaluation framework by the end of 2021, with
a progress update in 2020.

22.    Leaders also noted the need for the Pacific Resilience Partnership to consider other risks
such as from solid waste, including technological, medical and chemical waste.

             Regional Security

     23.      Leaders commended the progress made on implementing the Boe Declaration and
     endorsed the Boe Declaration Action Plan, including the establishment of the Sub-Committee of
     the Forum Officials’ Committee on Regional Security. Leaders requested that traditional and
     cultural norms be acknowledged and considered as an underpinning imperative of all security
     initiatives under the Boe Action Plan.

             Oceans and Maritime Boundaries

     24.    Leaders noted with concern the threat posed by sea level rise to securing the Blue Pacific,
     and reaffirmed their commitment to conclude negotiations on all outstanding maritime boundaries
     claims and zones.

     25.     Leaders discussed progress made by Members to conclude negotiations on maritime
     boundary claims since the Leaders meeting in Nauru 2018, and encouraged Members to conclude
     all outstanding maritime boundaries claims and zones. Additionally, Leaders reaffirmed the
     importance of preserving Members’ existing rights stemming from maritime zones, in the face of
     sea level rise, noting the existing and ongoing regional mechanisms to support maritime boundaries
     delimitation.

     26.    Leaders committed to a collective effort, including to develop international law, with the
     aim of ensuring that once a Forum Member’s maritime zones are delineated in accordance with
     the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, that the Members maritime zones could not be
     challenged or reduced as a result of sea-level rise and climate change.

     27.     Leaders agreed that pursuing their claims for extended continental shelf, under Article 76
     of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, is important and requested ongoing support and
     assistance by relevant regional agencies on Members’ submission to the Commission on the Limits
     of the Continental Shelf.

             Nuclear Contaminants

     28.    Leaders expressed concern for the significance of the potential threat of nuclear
     contamination, World War II wrecks and unexploded ordnances to the health and security of the
     Blue Pacific her people and prospects, acknowledged the importance of addressing the long-
     standing issues of nuclear testing legacy in the Pacific and called for the operationalisation of the
     provisions of the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty (Rarotonga Treaty), as necessary.

     29.     Leaders recalled that the UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres raised concerns about
     the nuclear waste storage facility on Runit Island, Enewetak Atoll, Republic of the Marshall Islands
     as ‘a kind of coffin’ and warned of health consequences to the local communities resulting from the
     nuclear tests. Leaders reiterated their ongoing concern on nuclear contamination issues in the
     Republic of the Marshall Islands, and particularly in respect of the nuclear test site at Runit. Leaders
     called on the United States Government to increase its monitoring and to address health
     consequences related to the nuclear testing programme.

30.      Leaders agreed to continue support towards bilateral, regional and multilateral action to
assist the Republic of the Marshall Islands in its efforts to engage the United States Government
in a meaningful way, in order to achieve for the Republic of the Marshall Islands, full, fair and a
just resolution of all outstanding nuclear testing legacy issues, and agreed to submit letters to the
United States Government urging the United States Government to take further action to

      COLLECTIVE ENGAGEMENT AND ADVOCACY FOR SECURING OUR BLUE
      PACIFIC

      38.    Leaders acknowledged the increasing strategic competition and cooperation in the Pacific
      and the opportunities presented for securing our Blue Pacific Continent. Leaders remained
      cognisant that the challenge for the Forum would be maintaining regional solidarity in the face of
      more intense political engagement, which may serve to divide the Forum collective.

      39.      Leaders emphasised the importance of genuine partnerships that reflect the collective
      priorities of the region and engages all Forum Members, reaffirming our Blue Pacific approach.
      Accordingly, Leaders endorsed the following Blue Pacific Principles for collective Pacific Islands
      Forum Dialogue and Engagement:

              (i)     One Blue Pacific – recognising and engaging with the full Forum Membership;
              (ii)    Regional priorities – embedding and progressing the Forum’s regional priorities;
              (iii)   Partnership approach – joint planning, programming and delivery by both the
                      Pacific Islands Forum and the Forum Dialogue Partner(s);
              (iv)    Utilising existing mechanisms – aligning with, and seeking to build-off existing
                      regional and international mechanisms, processes and meetings; and
              (v)     Collective outcomes and impact – developing joint outcomes statements and
                      outlining a clear process for follow-up and implementation.

              Forum Dialogue Partners Review and Engagement

      40.     In consideration of the Blue Pacific Principles and in recognising the importance of
      effective partnerships and engagements, Leaders noted with concern that not all Forum Dialogue
      partners are effectively engaging with the Pacific Islands Forum to a level that justifies their status
      as Forum Dialogue Partners.

      41.    Leaders directed a review of the criteria set to become a Forum Observer or a Forum
      Dialogue Partner for their consideration at the 51st Pacific Islands Forum.

      42.    In reflecting on the effectiveness of partnerships, Leaders discussed the recent
      developments on the UN General Assembly Resolution on UN – Pacific Islands Forum
      Cooperation. Leaders agreed to engage and seek to secure the support and solidarity of Forum
      Dialogue Partners in international fora.

      43.    Leaders considered recent applications for Forum Dialogue Partner status by the Kingdom
      of Norway and the Republic of Chile and agreed to defer its decision on these to their next Forum.
      Leaders also considered an application for Forum Observer status from the International
      Committee of the Red Cross and agreed to respectfully decline the application on the basis that
      the organisation did not meet the criteria set out for Forum Observers.

STRENGTHENING INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS TO SECURE OUR BLUE
PACIFIC

44.      In the context of securing the Blue Pacific, Leaders considered a range of regional
institutional arrangements.

       Review of the Framework for Pacific Regionalism

45.     In considering a long term 2050 strategy for securing the future of the Blue Pacific, Leaders
reaffirmed the importance of inclusivity and agreed to maintain the public consultation process
as a fundamental principle for advancing the strategy and for driving collective action under the
Framework for Pacific Regionalism.

46.     Leaders agreed to the review of the Terms of Reference and mandate of the Specialist Sub-
Committee on Regionalism (SSCR), including for greater oversight by Members as a means to
better ensure that the SSCR is able to provide advice on the 2050 Strategy for the Blue Pacific
Continent for deepening regionalism, to be considered together with the Strategy at the 51st Pacific
Islands Forum Meeting in Vanuatu.

       Independent Report on the Forum Troika Review of Forum Meeting Processes

47.    Leaders welcomed the Independent Report on the Forum Troika Review of Pacific Islands
Forum Meeting Processes and supported the proposal from Forum Foreign Ministers to refer the
Report to the FOC Sub-Committee on Forum International Engagement and Advocacy for further
discussion, and to report to the 2019 FOC Budget Session.

       Regional Fisheries Ministers Meeting

48.     Leaders recalled their 2015 decision endorsing Fisheries as a regional priority and the 2017
decision that Fisheries be a standing item on the Leaders agenda. Leaders further recalled their
2018 decision endorsing the establishment of a Regional Fisheries Ministers Meeting to ensure
effective oversight across the multidimensional issues that impact our region’s fisheries.

49.     Leaders welcomed and endorsed the Terms of Reference for a Regional Fisheries
Ministers Meeting and agreed with the advent of the Special Regional Fisheries Ministers Meeting
to disband the officials level Fisheries Taskforce.

50.    Leaders also welcomed the adoption of the Regional Longline Strategy by Forum Fisheries
Ministers.

51.    Leaders considered and accepted the report card of the Regional Roadmap for
Sustainable Fisheries by the Forum Fisheries Committee (FFC) Chair (Federated States of
Micronesia) and the outcomes of the FFC Ministers Meeting in June 2019.

-----------------------Page 57 End-----------------------

     52.     Leaders reaffirmed their commitment to work collectively to harness, secure, protect and
     sustainably manage, use and conserve, the living resources of the Blue Pacific such as coastal and
     oceanic fisheries – as part of the 2050 Strategy for the Blue Pacific Continent.

             A Regional Mechanism to Address Oil Spills

     53.     Leaders recognised the significant environmental risk posed by oil leaks and spills from
     the corroding hulls of World War II Wrecks. This risk is exacerbated by climate change events
     such as severe tropical cyclones and typhoons.

     54.    Leaders agreed that the Forum Officials’ Committee and the Secretariat, in collaboration
     with other CROP agencies, work on a Regional Mechanism and Action Plan, and that the Action

         Kainaki II Declaration for Urgent Climate Change Action Now
Securing the Future of our Blue Pacific

1.    We, the Leaders of the Pacific Islands Forum, meeting in Tuvalu see first-hand the impacts
and implications of the climate change crisis facing our Pacific Island Nations.

2.      Right now, climate change and disasters are impacting all our countries. Our seas are rising,
oceans are warming, and extreme events such as cyclones and typhoons, flooding, drought and
king tides are frequently more intense, inflicting damage and destruction to our communities and
ecosystems and putting the health of our peoples at risk. All around the world, people affected by
disaster and climate change-induced displacement are losing their homes and livelihoods,
particularly the most vulnerable atoll nations.

3.     As Leaders, we reflect and acknowledge the substantial work and investment over two and
half decades of climate change negotiations, commitments, and scientific advancements, all
intended to avert the crisis we now face. However, we are concerned that progress within the
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) must keep pace with the
challenges we face today and in the future, in line with the Boe Declaration on Regional Security.

4.     We hear the voices of our youth and the most vulnerable within our societies, having a loud
and resounding impact. In amplifying the alarm we have been sounding for decades, including the
youth of Tuvalu who called for the preservation of their homeland and culture. We welcome the
Republic of the Marshall Islands’ role as co-lead on the United Nations Secretary General (UNSG)
Climate Action Summit’s Youth and Public Mobilisation track, including through promoting the
“Kwon Gesh” Youth Climate Pledge.

5.     We welcome the work of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which
remains the authoritative scientific body on climate change and is regarded as providing
governments the best available science on climate change. The IPCC Special Report on Global
Warming of 1.5°C indicates that in model pathways with no or limited overshoots of 1.5°C above
pre-industrial levels, global net anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions decline by about 45%
from 2010 levels by 2030, reaching net zero around 2050.

6.      We note with grave concern and fear for our collective future that global greenhouse gas
emissions continue to rise, reaching record levels; and based on current trends, without urgent
action, we will exceed 1.5°C by as early as 2030 and reach 3°C or more by the end of this century.

7.     We are of the conviction that the shared prosperity and security of our Blue Pacific can
only safely exist if the international community pursue efforts to limit global warming to 1.5°C
above pre-industrial levels, as set out in the Paris Agreement. The science is non-negotiable.
Urgent action by the international community to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is critical to
keep us on the 1.5°C pathway.




                                                 12



                                                Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat | 2019 Annual Report   61
-----------------------Page 61 End-----------------------

     8.     Urgent action is needed to ensure our shared needs and interests, potential and survival of
     our Blue Pacific and this great Blue Planet.

     9.      It is clear that to overcome the climate change crisis facing our Pacific Island Nations, we
     must increase our global solidarity and align our actions with our common concerns. Any failure
     to act will impact not just us, but our children and all generations to come. The time to act is now.

     10.     The Pacific Ocean is at the heart of our Blue Pacific narrative and critical for our future.
     As Leaders of the Pacific Islands Forum, custodians of the world’s largest ocean and carbon sink,
     and representatives of our Pacific peoples, we call for immediate action and not just discussion of
     ambition. Action must be taken in our region, and internationally, to support clean, healthy, and
     productive oceans, the sustainable management, use and conservation of marine resources, growth
     in the blue economy and address the impacts of climate change on ocean health.

     Our Commitment to Bold Regional Climate Change Action

     11.    As Leaders of the Pacific Islands Forum, we recognise that to lead is to act and
     acknowledge the action being taken by all our Members, but we know more needs to be done. To
     secure the future of our Blue Pacific, we have pursued and must continue to pursue, bold and
     innovative regional solutions recognising that each of our nation’s futures, as well as the actions
     we choose to take, are interconnected.

     12.     Our actions and voices must be consistent with a collective vision and we have committed
     to developing a regional 2050 Strategy to secure the future of the Blue Pacific. Further, the Boe
     Declaration on Regional Security recognises climate change as the region’s single greatest security
     threat and through its expanded concept of security, we are increasing our ability to respond and
     manage threats to our security.

     13.     We have established the Framework for Resilient Development in the Pacific (FRDP) and
     its inclusive Pacific Resilience Partnership (PRP) as an integrated approach to address climate
     change adaptation and disaster risk management and will continue to collaborate to build regional
     resilience. In this spirit, we direct the PRP Taskforce to further elaborate the FRDP in line with
     the Paris Agreement and finalise the Monitoring & Evaluation framework by the end of 2021, with
     a progress update in 2020.

     14.    We are committed to a collective effort, including to develop international law, with the
     aim to ensure that once a Forum Member’s maritime zones are delineated in accordance with the
     1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), that the Member’s maritime
     zones could not be challenged or reduced as a result of sea level rise and climate change.

     15.    We are taking action to protect our fisheries resources, and to conserve and restore our
     marine ecosystems and biodiversity. We are working to protect our ocean from harmful plastics
     through our Pacific Regional Action Plan on Marine Litter 2018-2025 and call on Pacific Rim
     countries to join and commit to action on addressing marine pollution and marine debris.

62   Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat | 2019 Annual Report
-----------------------Page 62 End-----------------------

16.    As a region, we are also creating innovative regional platforms, financial instruments, and
services to build our resilience and secure our future. We welcome the substantial investment and
technical support provided to date, and request further financial and technical support to elaborate
our emerging initiatives.

The Blue Pacific’s Calls for Urgent, Transformational Global Climate Change Action

17.    This December marks the twenty fifth meeting of the Conference of the Parties (COP 25)
to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), and is a key
opportunity for countries to highlight and increase their pre-2020 ambition and action before the
Paris Agreement is fully operational in 2020.

18.     We firmly believe that the UNSG Climate Action Summit, the SAMOA Pathway Review,
and COP 25 are global turning points to ensure meaningful, measurable and effective climate
change action. As Leaders, we commit to act as one family, with mutual respect and
responsibilities, to empower our people and secure a shared, bright future for our Blue Pacific. We
reinforce the need for transformational change at scale, and for courageous and committed leaders
prepared to urgently deliver on real, tangible outcomes.

19.           We, the Leaders of the Pacific Islands Forum, call for:

      (i)        As we approach the 2020 milestone, all parties to the Paris Agreement to meet or
                 exceed their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) in order to pursue global
                 efforts to limit global warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, recognising that
                 this is critical to the security of our Blue Pacific. For those that are not a Party to the
                 Paris Agreement, we believe they should take similar steps to pursue efforts to limit
                 global warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels;

      (ii)       All Parties to the Paris Agreement to formulate and communicate mid-century long-
                 term low greenhouse gas emissions development strategies by 2020. This may include
                 commitments and strategies to achieve net zero carbon by 2050, taking into account
                 the urgency highlighted by the IPCC Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C, and
                 establish the necessary policy, financing and governance mechanisms required to
                 achieve this;

      (iii)      All countries to recall the United Nations Secretary General’s opening remarks at the
                 Pacific Islands Forum Leaders-UNSG High-level Dialogue2 in May 2019 regarding
                 carbon pricing, fossil fuel subsidies, and just transition from fossil fuels, and invite all
                 Parties to the Paris Agreement to reflect on these views when updating their NDCs and
                 formulating Low Emissions Development Strategies (LEDS);

      (iv)       The members of G7 and G20 to rapidly implement their commitment to phase out
                 inefficient fossil fuel subsidies, acknowledging the priorities of the United Nations
                 Secretary General for the upcoming Climate Action Summit;

-----------------------Page 63 End-----------------------

         (v)      The international community to continue efforts towards meeting their global climate
                  finance commitment of USD 100 billion per year by 2020 from a variety of sources in
                  the context of meaningful mitigation actions and transparency on implementation,
                  through bilateral, regional or global mechanisms, including the replenishment of the
                  Green Climate Fund; and to complete work required to enable the Adaptation Fund to
                  serve the Paris Agreement;

         (vi)     The international community to immediately increase support and assistance for
                  Pacific-led science-based initiatives intended to improve our understanding of risk and
                  vulnerability, including through support for modelling and risk mapping capabilities,
                  the development of methodologies for understanding, projecting and responding to
                  climate change-related economic and infrastructure impacts, and capacity building
                  support for evidence-based decision-making and project development;

         (vii)    The international community to welcome the work of the IPCC and consider in relevant
                  decision-making the findings of the Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C, the
                  Special Report on Climate Change and Land and the upcoming Special Report on
                  Oceans and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate;

         (viii)   All parties attending COP 25 to welcome the focus on oceans, and consider developing
                  a work programme on oceans within the United Nations Framework Convention on
                  Climate Change process and convene a workshop on the climate-ocean nexus in 2020;

         (ix)     All countries to accelerate support for the work of the Warsaw International
                  Mechanism for Loss and Damage associated with Climate Change Impacts and ensure
                  that efforts to avert, minimise and address loss and damage are key elements of the
                  financial support needed to meet climate change and development challenges in the
                  Pacific region; and,

         (x)      The United Nations Secretary General to urgently appoint a Special Adviser on climate
                  change and security and the United Nations Security Council to appoint a special
                  rapporteur to produce a regular review of global, regional and national security threats
                  caused by climate change, in recognition that climate change is the single greatest threat
                  to the Blue Pacific region as reaffirmed in the Boe Declaration on Regional Security
                  and is a growing global security threat.

     20. We call on all countries and non-state actors to join with the Blue Pacific in taking bold,
     decisive and transformative action to address the ever-present challenges of climate change.

EMERGING ECONOMIC ISSUES – IMPLICATIONS FOR PACIFIC ECONOMIES

6.      The Forum Secretariat presented a paper on the Emerging Economic issues of Forum
Island Countries, for information and discussion. The paper noted that global economic growth
for 2019 and 2020 is positive, but is expected to weaken in the first half of 2019. It noted that
the evolving global economic dynamics and challenges posed by the identified downside risks
can derail the projected global economic growth and Forum Island Countries (FIC)s’ trading
partners outlook. Further, that the domestic structural vulnerabilities coupled with high debt


                                               1
                                                 Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat | 2019 Annual Report   67
-----------------------Page 67 End-----------------------

     levels and limited fiscal space, would magnify the impact of global economic shocks and
     impacts from natural hazards risks.

     7.      The FEMM reaffirmed the importance of: building resilience to climate change and
     disaster shocks; finding a balance between the financing national infrastructure and sustainable
     national debt; managing the volatility on financial markets as a result of US-China trade dispute
     and its impact on the FICs’ offshore investment (through national trust and sovereign funds);
     improving inflows of remittance and seek support of development partners in addressing
     correspondence banking relationships and operation of Pacific Money Transfer Operators
     operating in major remitting economies; and, building policy foresight to deal with any
     probable future upswings in global food and fuel prices.

     8.      The FEMM further noted that remittance costs remain under pressure in the Pacific,
     due particularly to de-risking which continues to be a driver of remittance market challenges
     in the region. Economic Ministers urged relevant development partners, as well as PIF
     members to continue seeking domestic, regional and international solutions to address issues
     related to de-risking and cost of remittances to the Pacific.

     9.       Forum Economic Ministers recognised the need to:

           a. Undertake regional analyses on the comparison of the governance, portfolio
              management and returns of national trust funds;

           b. Consider FICs’ vulnerabilities in the IMF-WBG Debt Sustainability Analyses; and

           c. Encourage country and regional initiatives that broadens economic base and activities,
              including improved food security through agriculture, strengthened human capital
              through investment in education and health, improved connectivity to propel trade,
              tourism and digital economy, and enhance capacity for meeting the growing energy
              needs.



     THE PACIFIC RESILIENCE FACILITY

     10.    The FEMM noted the significant progress made on the Pacific Resilience Facility
     (PRF) following its endorsement by Forum Economic Ministers and Forum Leaders, in 2018.
     Forum Economic Ministers commended the Forum Secretariat and the FEMM endorsed PRF
     Technical Working Group on guiding and providing technical support since the 2018 FEMM.

     11.      Forum Economic Ministers:

           a. Acknowledged the funding support from Australia (Department of Foreign Affairs and
              Trade) to progress the FEMM decision related to the PRF;

           b. Discussed and noted progress-to-date on the following: (1) Purpose and Objectives;
              (2) Point of Difference and niche focus; (3) Typology and/or character; (4) Governance
              and domicile arrangements; (5) Capitalisation; (6) Contribution Policy; (7) Allocation

CO-INVESTMENT:  ATTRACTING                       INVESTMENT            IN     LONG         TERM
INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT

12.     The FEMM discussed the work done by the Pacific Islands Investment Forum (PIIF)
on co-investment of infrastructure development in the Pacific region, since the 2018 FEMM.
They acknowledged the interest expressed by the PIIF to co-invest through pooling part of their
investible funds in the region. As well, to further advance and explore opportunities for
collaboration and co-investment, the PIIF emphasised the support of Forum Economic
Ministers as essential.

13.    The FEMM noted the PIIF co-investment proposal as an opportunity to bridge the
financing gap on infrastructure and private sector development in the region, noting that their
combined assets and portfolios are currently estimated at USD50 billion.

14.      Forum Economic Ministers:

      a. Noted progress on co-investment initiative led by the Pacific Islands Investment Forum
         (PIIF), and particularly in the following areas:

            i.   Identification of regulatory investment barriers to PIIF member funds investing
                 in Pacific jurisdictions;

           ii.   Clarification of infrastructure investment pipeline, noting further work is
                 required on those infrastructure projects; and

          iii.   The establishment of a regional co-investment vehicle for PIIF member funds,
                 and the potential for exploring investment infrastructure opportunities with
                 governments, private sector, and donors/agencies.

      b. Welcomed the initiative by PIIF member funds to invest in Pacific infrastructure
         opportunities;

      c. Endorsed the following (short-term) next steps to be led by PIIF, and supported by the
         Forum Secretariat:

            i.   Establishment of a PIIF Secretariat function, including the responsibility for
                 progressing research and liaison with governments (and donors/agencies);

           ii.   Engagement with Pacific islands governments around the potential for tax and
                 other regulatory exemption(s) for PIIF member funds, and/or a Special Purpose
                 Vehicle (SPV) comprising PIIF member funds;

          iii.   Liaising more closely with governments (and donors/agencies) to identify
                 infrastructure projects that are yet to be announced and/or had finance/funding
                 confirmed, in order to explore co-investment opportunities for PIIF members
                 (or an SPV), and alternative engagement models such as Public Investment

-----------------------Page 69 End-----------------------

                      model, to help create a clear and viable role for PIIF member funds in
                      infrastructure investment;

               iv.    Engagement with donors/agencies to progress and realise the co-investment
                      SPV concept; and

           d. Directed PIIF and the Forum Secretariat to report back on the progress on Co-
              investment initiative at the 2020 FEMM.



     CLIMATE CHANGE AND DISASTER RISK FINANCE: ‘LEVERAGING THE
     TRIPLE DIVIDEND OF RESILIENCE’

     15.     The FEMM noted that over the last decade FICs have accessed USD1.1 billion in
     climate finance, of which 48% was from bilateral sources and 52% from multilateral sources.
     While the FEMM has historically focused on increasing access to international climate and
     disaster risk finance, Forum Economic Ministers underscored the importance of increasing the
     focus on the ‘effectiveness’ of climate finance. The influx of additional finance has had
     significant implications on Ministries of Finance, including their expanded role in development
     decisions and related, increased administrative burden. A large proportion of these additional
     funds are not channelled through the central agency systems, and in some cases, negatively
     impact implementation effectiveness and policy coherence.

     16.     In light of growing economic, social, and environmental risks, FEMM noted that it is
     crucial to evaluate the effectiveness of climate finance modalities, systems, and implementation
     results to date to ensure a clear understanding of the progress that has been made. This is also
     important because global climate finance flows are expected to increase from the current
     estimated US$60 billion per year to the agreed global commitment of US$100 billion per year
     by 2020. Forum Economic Ministers highlighted that efforts to fully track the effectiveness of
     climate finance remain in their infancy in the region. Revised and robust national financial
     management and planning systems are required to increase tracking capability. Revised FICs
     national systems will help them invest more strategically in initiatives that build resilience. The
     FEMM also noted the concept of the ‘triple-dividend’ of resilience as a conceptual tool for
     evaluating the effectiveness and efficiency of resilient investments.

     17.      Forum Economic Ministers:

           a. Requested the Forum Secretariat to work with partners to assist with strengthening
              FICs national capacity for resilient investments through an approach guided by criteria
              of the ‘triple dividend of resilience’ concept and based on the findings of the PCCFAF
              reports;

           b. Agreed to establish a revised approach for assessing PFM systems through expanding
              the current PEFA diagnostic outputs to include indicators that assess expenditure
              effectiveness of climate change finance;

           c. Tasked the Forum Secretariat to work with PFTAC, Member countries, and partners
              to progress the work outlined in paragraph17(b) and provide an update to the 2020
              FEMM;

-----------------------Page 70 End-----------------------

   d. Agreed to scale up regional and national efforts to track the effectiveness of climate
      finance flows in order to increase the responsiveness, agility, and transparency of
      government service delivery and tasked the Forum Secretariat to support this regional
      effort through the development, provision, and deployment of relevant tools (such as
      Climate Budget Tracking) as well as targeted assistance for national PFM system
      reform; and

   e. Agreed that the Forum Secretariat will continue to work with partners such as PIPSO
      and national Chambers of Commerce to expand the opportunities, capacity, and
      resources required to accelerate the delivery of resilient development priorities in
      keeping with the 2018 FEMM decision.



PACIFIC ISLANDS CLIMATE CHANGE INSURANCE FACILITY (PICCIF)

18.    In 2018, the FEMM directed the PICCIF Taskforce (including CROP and other
partners) to further advance the work on PICCIF. Efforts by SPREP in 2019 have identified
partners and a funding agreement is expected to be signed in 2019. The funds will allow the
PICCIF Expert Group to meet and implement key actions required to progress development of
the concept.

19.    Forum Economic Ministers noted the progress report and the intent of the PICCIF
Taskforce to develop the PICCIF concept for consideration in 2020.

              including the UN High Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development; UN High
              Level Forum on Accelerating the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable
              Development; UN Climate Change Summit; and S.A.M.O.A Pathway High Level
              Midterm Review, 27 September 2019; and tasked the FOC Sub-Committee on
              International Engagement and Advocacy to coordinate regional efforts in this regard.

     22.      The FEMM considered issues in relation to EU Non-Cooperative Tax Jurisdiction.

     23.      Forum Economic Ministers:

           a. Agreed that Forum Island countries work collectively in seeking further clarifications,
              information and expressing their concerns to the EU directly and at appropriate fora;

           b. Directed PIFS, through its relationship with the ACP, to seek further information from
              the EU on behalf of relevant PIF members on details of the requirements and processes

        I.   PRIVATE SECTOR DIALOGUE WITH ECONOMIC MINISTERS

1. The Pacific Private Sector Dialogue with the Forum Economic Ministers was held on 9
   May 2019. The Dialogue considered critical issues of the regional private sector, which
   focussed on:
   • Accessing climate financing including resilient infrastructure finance, building
      standards, and insurance products; and
   • The Pacific Australia Card.

2. The meeting reiterated the importance of business continuity in the event of disasters, to
   enable quick economic recovery and stability. The meeting underscored the need for:
   • easy to access affordable and appropriate insurance products, including micro-
      insurance for the MSMEs noting their importance to the national economies;
   • modern and customised building codes to ensure physical assets withstand expected
      intensity of extreme climate change and natural hazard risk events; and,
   • easy and quick intra-Forum travel could generate for both national and regional trade
      and investment flows.

3. The Economic Ministers and regional Private Sector Representatives:

   a. Committed to enhanced engagement with the Private Sector in the climate and related
      infrastructure financing discussions and decision making at the national and regional
      levels;

   b. Committed to strengthen households and MSMEs’ resilience across the region, in
      relation to, access to finance, capacity development, and affordable and appropriate
      insurance products (including, micro-insurance);

   c. Tasked the Secretariat to continue engaging the Private Sector in the further
      development of Pacific Resilience Facility;

   d. Requested the Pacific Regional Infrastructure Facility (PRIF) to report to 2020 FEMM
      and Private Sector Dialogue, with an update on its work on improving building codes
      and standards in the region;

   e. Welcomed Australia’s commitment to a Pacific-Australia Card, which is expected to
      be launched this year;

-----------------------Page 75 End-----------------------

         f. Endorsed and launched the Pacific Regional Tender Portal and requested the CROP
            agencies and Member governments to use the portal, and the Forum Secretariat to
            socialise the portal across the region; and,

         g. Noted the importance of the Pacific Islands Private Sector Organisation (PIPSO) and
            the ongoing PIPSO review, and called for additional financing to enable full and
            effective private sector representation.


           II.   CIVIL SOCIETY ORGANISATIONS DIALOGUE WITH ECONOMIC
                                      MINISTERS

     1. Civil Society thanked the FEMM Chair and Ministers for the opportunity to engage in the
        FEMM, in the spirit of inclusivity, equity, equality and partnership embodied in the
        Framework for Pacific Regionalism.

     2. Forum Economic Ministers noted with concern the CSOs call for a moratorium on Deep-
        Seas Mining (DSM). Ministers asserted that DSM is a sovereign issue to be decided by
        countries. However, Ministers and CSOs agreed that an independent regional study on
        DSM and its implication for Pacific economies, the environment and ocean biodiversity,
        and livelihoods of people, would provide evidence-based information to inform policy
        decisions of countries on DSM.

     3. Economic Ministers and the Civil Society Organisations:
     a. endorsed the CSO dialogue with Forum Economic Ministers as a permanent feature of the
        FEMM;
     b. noted the progress on the establishment of the Pacific Sports Physical Activity Physical
        Education (PSPAPE) Action Plan 2019-2030 through the Pacific Regional Sports
        Taskforce; and endorsed the final report of the research conducted on ‘Maximising the
        Contribution of Sports to Economic and social development of Pacific Island countries:
        The Case of Fiji and Samoa’;
     c. noted the progress on the regional youth employment initiative, and welcomed the
        proposed work plan going forward;
     d. supported the intention of CSOs to undertake a study in collaboration with relevant
        partners, on the cost of violence against women and girls on the Pacific economy focusing
        in particular on resilience building for ending all forms of violence against women and
        girls, and the practical solutions of reducing the costs of violence, and report back to FEMM
        in 2020;
     e. acknowledged the intention of CSOs to undertake an independent feasibility study in
        collaboration with relevant partners, on the impacts of seabed mineral harvesting and
        exploration in their respective jurisdictions;
     f. welcomed and noted the inclusion of civil society representation within the design of the
        Pacific Resilience Facility (PRF):

A 2050 STRATEGY FOR THE BLUE PACIFIC

3.      Ministers acknowledged that climate change, the geopolitical context and the development
challenges facing the Blue Pacific region called for deep and critical thinking about the future of
Pacific regionalism and the role that the Pacific Islands Forum can play in securing the future of
the Pacific.

4.    In this context, Ministers considered the findings of the Interim Review of the Framework
for Pacific Regionalism (FPR), including subsequent discussions by the Forum Officials
Committee (FOC).

5.     Ministers:

       (i)      considered and welcomed the report from the FOC Sub-Committee on the Interim
                Review of the FPR, and the report from the FOC Specialist Sub-Committee on
                Regionalism (SSCR), as it related to recommendations 1, 4, and 9 of the Interim
                Review of the FPR;

       (ii)     reaffirmed the importance of inclusivity and agreed to maintain the public
                consultation process as a fundamental principle of inclusivity for advancing Pacific
                regionalism;

       (iii)    supported the development of a 2050 Blue Pacific Strategy for deepening Pacific
                Regionalism under the FPR, recognising the need to have practical short and mid-

                             Islands Forum in Vanuatu.

     STRENGTHENING OUR REGIONAL PRIORITIES TOWARDS A SECURE FUTURE

     FISHERIES

     6.     Ministers recalled that in 2017, Leaders endorsed fisheries as a standing agenda item for
     their meeting in recognition of the vital importance of the fisheries sector, and that the
     multidimensional nature of fisheries issues necessitates a whole of government approach and
     Leaders’ oversight.

     7.     Furthermore, in 2018 Leaders endorsed the proposal for an annual Regional Fisheries
     Ministers Meeting, in the margins of the Forum Fisheries Committee Ministerial Meeting, to report
     to Leaders on all fisheries related matters.

     8.     Ministers discussed how the fisheries sector can best be supported to ensure that Forum
     Members are proactive in securing the region’s fish for the future and that the region’s
     development aspirations are not undermined.

     9.      Ministers emphasised the importance of regional coordination, to increase the economic
     returns and ensure the sustainable management of fisheries and welcomed the increasing efforts
     of CROP agencies in this regard.

     10.    Ministers:

            (i)     noted the outcomes of the Sixteenth Forum Fisheries Committee Ministerial
                    Meeting;

            (ii)    welcomed the establishment and outcomes of the Special Regional Fisheries
                    Ministerial Meeting (RFMM) in Pohnpei, Federated States of Micronesia;

            (iii)   noted the endorsement of the Terms of Reference for the RFMM;

            (iv)    noted the Fisheries Ministers’ recommendation to disband the Fisheries Taskforce
                    comprising FFA, PNAO, PIFS and SPC;

            (v)     agreed on the need for stronger coordination at national and regional levels,
                    particularly through the RFMM, given the links and synergies between fisheries
                    and trade, economic, security and environmental issues so as to ensure a

               comprehensive and multi-dimensional approach to the advice provided to Forum
               Leaders on issues and benefits relating to the Blue Pacific fisheries; and

       (vi)    noted their concern that harmful fisheries subsidies can contribute to economic
               losses in the fisheries sector.

CLIMATE CHANGE AND RESILIENCE: FORUM CLIMATE CHANGE ADVOCACY

11.     Ministers reaffirmed that climate change remains the single greatest threat to the Pacific
region, as articulated by Forum Leaders in the Boe Declaration, and that effectively combatting
climate change was central to securing our future in the Pacific.

12.     Ministers noted that 2019 marked an important milestone for the region, with the meeting
of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) 25th Conference of Parties
(COP25) and the last year before the Paris Agreement becomes fully operational in 2020. This
year also marked the inaugural visit of the UN Secretary-General to the region to meet with Pacific
Islands Forum Leaders, in the lead up to his Climate Action Summit in New York in September.
Further, this year will see the release of the IPCC Special Reports on Oceans and Cryosphere and
on Climate Change and Land.

13.    Ministers discussed the current state of the regional and global debate on how to respond
to climate change, building on the outcomes of Pacific Leaders’ dialogue with the UN Secretary-
General in May, the 2018 IPCC Special Report on 1.5°C, and the outcomes from the UNFCCC
negotiations in Bonn in June.

14.    Ministers:

       (i)     recommended that Leaders issue a high-level statement or declaration on climate
               change for the UN Secretary-General’s Climate Action Summit and the UNFCCC
               COP25 to ‘securing our future in the Pacific’;

       (ii)    noted the high-level priorities that were set out in the paper, and additional
               priorities, adaptation, mitigation, and other issues that may be further raised, as
               proposed core elements of the Pacific Region’s climate change advocacy for the
               UNSG Climate Action Summit and COP25; and

       (iii)   tasked the Secretariat to consult further with Members and work with the One
               CROP Plus and the FOC Sub-Committee on Forum International Engagement and
               Advocacy to identify climate change priorities.

CLIMATE CHANGE AND RESILIENCE: PACIFIC RESILIENCE PARTNERSHIP

15.    Ministers recognised the 2017 Leaders decision that supported an initial two-year trial
period for the Pacific Resilience Partnership (PRP) governance arrangements to ensure effective
implementation of the Framework for Resilient Development in the Pacific (FRDP).

-----------------------Page 81 End-----------------------

     16.    Ministers noted an update on the progress made over the past two years on the PRP
     governance arrangements, including the inaugural biennial Pacific Resilience Meeting convened
     in Suva in May 2019 under the theme of ‘Youth Futures in a Resilient Pacific’.

     17.    Ministers acknowledged that whilst the PRP was innovative, progress on implementation
     has been slower than expected.

     18.    Ministers:

            (i)     noted the work carried out to date to implement the FRDP, including through the
                    establishment and operationalisation of the PRP governance arrangement, and
                    convening the inaugural, biennial Pacific Resilience Meeting held in May 2019;

            (ii)    recalled the 2017 Leaders’ decision to trial the PRP governance arrangements for
                    two years and, based on utility and progress, recommended that Leaders extend
                    the trial period on the PRP governance arrangements until 2020 to be informed by
                    a review of the effectiveness and efficiency of the governance arrangements;

            (iii)   tasked the PRP to further strengthen efforts to improve the regional commitment
                    and contribution of stakeholders and consolidate the partnership under the FRDP
                    noting the linkages with existing and emerging regional instruments; and

            (iv)    requested the PRP Taskforce to provide an annual update to FOC on the progress
                    of implementation of the FRDP.

     REGIONAL SECURITY (BOE DECLARATION)

     19.     Ministers recalled Leaders’ endorsement of the Boe Declaration in 2018 and their call for
     an action plan to be developed for implementation and for the Secretariat to provide a progress
     report to the Forum Troika by June 2019.

     20.    Ministers considered and discussed the recommendations made by the FOC on the draft
     Boe Declaration Action Plan and the establishment of a FOC Sub-Committee on Regional Security
     to coordinate and prioritise the implementation of the Boe Declaration and existing Forum security
     declarations.

     21.    Ministers:

            (i)     endorsed the draft Boe Declaration Action Plan;

            (ii)    endorsed the establishment of a FOC Sub-Committee on Regional Security, and
                    its role in further prioritising actions and activities under the Boe Declaration
                    Action Plan, noting existing capabilities and regional security mechanisms; and




                                                        4


82   Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat | 2019 Annual Report
-----------------------Page 82 End-----------------------

       (iii)   tasked the Secretariat to design and develop a Pacific Security Dialogue through
               the FOC Sub-Committee on Regional Security in order to provide a more inclusive
               space for regional security discussions.

NUCLEAR CONTAMINANTS

22.     Ministers acknowledged that the issue of the nuclear testing legacy in the Pacific has been
a standing agenda item on the Leaders annual meeting, but in the context of the Marshall Islands’
request for support in its efforts to resolve nuclear testing legacy issues with the Government of
the United States.

23.    While considering additional or alternative modalities for strengthening support to the
Republic of the Marshall Islands, Ministers also considered the potential threat of nuclear
contamination to the health and security of the entire Blue Pacific, posed by the post-World War
II nuclear testing programmes in the Republic of the Marshall Islands, Kiribati and French
Polynesia, as well as the 2011 Fukushima nuclear reactor accident.

24.    In the context of discussions, Vanuatu encouraged Members to sign up to the 2017 UN
Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons.

25.    Ministers:

       (i)     acknowledged the importance of addressing the long-standing issue of nuclear
               testing legacy in the Pacific; and

       (ii)    endorsed the proposal that the Forum Secretariat work together with Members,
               CROP agencies, and other partners to accelerate collective action to address the
               issue, and in particular:

               (a)    to task the Secretariat to coordinate the compilation and analysis of all
                      available scientific assessments of the impact of nuclear testing activities on
                      the health and security of the Blue Pacific and its peoples, including the
                      request for inclusion of Kiritimati;

               (b)    to task the Secretariat to develop options on a stocktake of unexploded
                      ordnances and World War II remnants;

               (c)    to consider, if necessary, the commissioning of an appropriate body to
                      undertake a comprehensive, independent and objective scientific
                      assessment of the issue;

               (d)    to consider whether additional or alternative modalities for Forum support
                      to the Republic of the Marshall Islands, and other Members similarly
                      situated, is warranted; and

-----------------------Page 83 End-----------------------

                    (e)      to promote the status of the entire Blue Pacific as a nuclear free zone,
                             adopting modalities to foster meaningful international cooperation under
                             the framework of the Rarotonga Treaty to end the proliferation of nuclear
                             weapons globally, and to this end, to consider modernisation of certain
                             operational provisions of the Rarotonga Treaty provisions where necessary.

     OCEANS AND MARITIME BOUNDARIES

     26.      Ministers acknowledged the ongoing support by SPC, FFA, the Secretariat and other
     agencies and considered the ongoing regional work on the demarcation of maritime boundaries
     and delimitation of maritime zones, including to highlight for discussion the threat posed by sea
     level rise to Members’ baselines and maritime claims established pursuant to the 1982 Law of the
     Sea Convention (1982 LOSC).

     27.     Ministers discussed the threat posed by sea level rise to Members’ rights stemming from
     maritime zones under the 1982 LOSC and considered the options on a way forward to ensure that
     sea level rise and the potential permanent inundation of baselines and basepoints, in no way, shape
     or form, derogates upon the maritime interests and sovereign rights stemming from maritime
     zones, pursuant to the 1982 LOSC.

     28.    Ministers:

            (i)     encouraged Members to conclude negotiations on maritime boundary claims and
                    delineation of their maritime zones, noting Leaders’ commitment to progressing
                    the resolution of outstanding maritime boundary claims and the report back on
                    progress to the 2019 Leaders’ meeting in Tuvalu;

            (ii)    endorsed the importance of preserving Members’ existing rights stemming from
                    maritime zones, in the face of sea level rise, noting the existing and ongoing
                    regional mechanisms to support maritime boundaries delimitation;

            (iii)   committed to a collective effort, including to develop international law with the
                    aim of ensuring that once a Forum Member’s maritime zones are delineated in
                    accordance with the 1982 LOSC, that the Members maritime zones could not be
                    challenged or reduced as a result of sea-level rise and climate change; and

            (iv)    noting the cross-cutting nature of these maritime issues, the sovereignty issues
                    associated therewith, and the multi-faceted components of the work, which will
                    involve, legal, technical, policy, and high-level diplomacy and advocacy input,
                    tasked the OPOC to work together with relevant CROP agencies to develop an
                    overview paper that outlines existing regional mechanisms and suggests
                    opportunities for closer collaboration between regional agencies to ensure effective
                    coordination.

WEST PAPUA (PAPUA)

29.     In view of the 2016 Forum Leaders’ decision that the issue of alleged human rights
violations in West Papua (Papua) should remain on their agenda, Ministers discussed the Forum’s
position on West Papua (Papua).

30.    Ministers:

       (i)     acknowledged the reported escalation in violence and continued allegations of
               human rights abuses in West Papua (Papua);

       (ii)    agreed to re-emphasise and reinforce the Forum’s position of raising its concerns
               over the violence and:

               (a)     call on all parties to protect and uphold the human rights of all residents;
               (b)     call on all parties to work to address the root causes of the conflict by
                       peaceful means;
               (c)     maintain open and constructive dialogue with Indonesia on the issue of
                       alleged human rights abuses and violations in West Papua (Papua); and

       (iii)   welcomed the invitation by Indonesia for a mission to West Papua (Papua) by the
               UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, and strongly encouraged both sides
               to finalise the timing of the visit and make every endeavour to provide a report on
               the situation before the next Pacific Islands Forum Leaders meeting in 2020.

INTERNATIONAL ENGAGEMENT AND ADVOCACY AS THE BLUE PACIFIC

FORUM INTERNATIONAL ADVOCACY PRIORITIES FOR 2020

31.      Ministers affirmed that strong and effective international advocacy, as one Blue Pacific, is
critical given that many of the priorities and challenges facing the Pacific region are transboundary
and crosscutting in nature and can only be effectively dealt with through international action.

32.   Ministers considered the thematic priorities for the Forum’s international engagement and
advocacy in 2020.

33.    Ministers:

       (i)     welcomed progress on implementation of the Strategy for PIF International
               Engagement and Advocacy, while calling for further, sustained participation and
               support by all Forum Members, at Capital and in overseas missions, and through
               the FOC Sub-Committee for Forum International Engagement and Advocacy;

       (ii)    noted the financial constraints faced by Members to sustain participation in
               international engagement and the additional challenges for those Members facing
               graduation from Official Development Assistance (ODA);

-----------------------Page 85 End-----------------------

            (iii)   encouraged the Secretariat to secure funding for Members to attend ongoing BBNJ
                    negotiations, noting the difficulty encountered by Members in accessing the BBNJ
                    Trust Fund;

            (iv)    endorsed maintaining the current international advocacy and engagement priorities
                    for 2020 (climate change and resilience; regional security; sustainable oceans
                    management, use and conservation; and 2030 Agenda including the S.A.M.O.A.
                    Pathway), while elevating a focus on sustainable ocean management, use and
                    conservation, and climate change and resilience, and in particular the links between
                    ocean and climate; and

            (v)     tasked the Secretariat to develop an Action Plan for Forum International
                    Engagement and Advocacy for the consideration of the FOC Sub-Committee for
                    Forum International Engagement and Advocacy, based on agreed international
                    advocacy priorities for 2020 and the decisions of the 50th Pacific Islands Forum
                    Meeting, for out-of-session endorsement of FOC, by December 2019.

     STRENGTHENING RELATIONS                     WITH         FORUM    DIALOGUE         AND      OTHER
     INTERNATIONAL PARTNERS

     34.     Ministers noted that shifting geopolitics and rising development challenges has led to an
     increasing focus on, and engagement with, the Blue Pacific region from international partners.

     35.     In this context, Ministers noted the findings of the Secretariat’s 2019 review of the Forum’s
     18 Dialogue Partners, including that the majority of Forum Dialogue Partners are increasing their
     regional engagement, through new or reinvigorated foreign policy strategies, interest in
     establishing dialogue mechanisms, and increasing involvement in Pacific regional organisations.

     36.    While welcoming Dialogue Partners’ increasing engagement, Ministers emphasised the
     need for genuine partnership that reflects the collective priorities of the region and engages all
     Forum Members and not a sub-set of Forum members, reaffirming a Blue Pacific approach.

     37.     Drawing on the findings of the review, Ministers considered initiatives to strengthen
     engagement with Forum Dialogue Partners, as one Blue Pacific, and in support of the Leaders’
     vision and priorities for the region.

     38.    Ministers:

            (i)     endorsed the findings of the 2019 Review of Forum Dialogue Partners;

            (ii)    endorsed the proposed Blue Pacific Principles for Dialogue and Engagement, as
                    follows:

                        One Blue Pacific – recognising and engaging with the full Forum Membership;

86   Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat | 2019 Annual Report
-----------------------Page 86 End-----------------------

                  Regional priorities – embedding and progressing the Forum’s regional
                   priorities;
                  Partnership approach – joint planning, programming and delivery by both the
                   PIF and the Forum Dialogue Partner;
                  Utilising existing mechanisms – aligning with, and seeking to build-off existing
                   regional and international mechanisms, processes and meetings;
                  Collective outcomes and impact – developing joint outcomes statements and
                   outlining a clear process for follow-up and implementation;

      (iii)   discussed and agreed on those Forum Dialogue Partners that are critical to the
              achievement of the Forum’s priorities, and for which the Forum should prioritise

      (iii)   considered the retirement of the Pacific Islands Development Program as initial

                             present and future generations against the adverse effects of climate change;
