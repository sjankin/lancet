Introduction

The overall objective of the WTO
is to help its members use trade as
a means to raise living standards,
create jobs and improve people’s
lives. The WTO operates the
global system of trade rules and
helps developing countries build
their trade capacity. It also
provides a forum for its members
to negotiate trade agreements and
to resolve the trade problems they
face with each other.

MESSAGE FROM

Message from DirectorGeneral Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala

A

s I write these words, the
world continues to grapple
with the COVID-19 pandemic
and its devastating health and
economic consequences. Close to
4 million people have already lost
their lives. Millions more have lost
livelihoods, or had their education
interrupted. Even as vaccine
production and roll-out gathers
speed, the supply of doses remains
far below what is needed. Poorer
countries are being left behind
in vaccine access and economic
prospects. People are dying even
though the means exist to save them.
When 2020 started, we had barely
heard of the novel coronavirus, and
had no inkling of the impact it would
go on to have on people’s lives and
the global economy.
The pandemic has had major effects
on global trade – and on the day-to-day
work of the WTO, which is the subject
of this annual report. The multilateral
trading system has played an important
part in efforts to fight COVID-19, and
I am convinced that the WTO can and
must do more.
In late 2019, WTO economists were
projecting 2.7% growth for world
merchandise trade in 2020 – modest
by historical standards, due in part to
protectionist measures and continuing
tensions around trade policy. By March
and April 2020, much of the global
economy had come to a sudden stop,
amid the large-scale implementation of
business closures, travel restrictions,
and social distancing measures
necessary to curb the spread of
COVID-19. Trade went into free fall.
In the second quarter of 2020, the
volume of world merchandise trade
shrank 15% year-on-year, the steepest

drop on record. But in the second
half of the year, as lockdowns began
to ease, trade rebounded strongly,
propelled by demand resulting from
extraordinary levels of fiscal and
monetary support, particularly in
advanced economies, as well as
the containment of the pandemic’s
impact in several Asian countries.
Restraint in the use of trade
protectionism was another important
factor in the trade rebound: policies
did not prevent supply chains from
restarting operations. Ultimately, for
2020 as a whole, merchandise trade
would go on to decline by 5.3% in
volume terms, and 7.6% in value – a
severe contraction, to be sure, but
smaller than that seen in 2009, during
the global financial crisis.
Importantly, trade’s resilience
represented a lifeline for millions,
enabling access to food and other
essential supplies. Despite some
initial disruptions, the value of trade
in medical products rose by 16%,
and trade in personal protective
equipment expanded by 50%.
Agriculture trade was relatively
unhindered, which meant vital food
supplies continued to move around
the world, including to net foodimporting developing countries. As
trade has picked up again, there
have been supply shortages, logistics
bottlenecks, and price spikes, but all
would have been vastly more disruptive
had businesses and households
been compelled to look for domestic
alternatives to imported products.
In Geneva, the WTO had to suspend
in-person gatherings in March and
April. Negotiations, regular committee
meetings, and other discussions
subsequently resumed in virtual and
hybrid formats, in line with the health
authorities’ recommendations. The

Twelfth Ministerial Conference (MC12),
originally scheduled for June 2020 in
Kazakhstan, was postponed, and is
now set to be held in Geneva from
30 November to 3 December 2021.
The WTO stepped up its longstanding
monitoring work to shed light on
trade measures governments were
introducing in response to the
pandemic, including an early spate
of export restrictions on medical
products. The analysis revealed that

A N N U A L R E P O R T 2 0 21

many of the trade restricting measures
were unwound, though too many still
persist. Perhaps surprisingly, measures
seeking to facilitate trade were more
numerous and covered more traded
merchandise, by value, than the
new restrictions – US$ 225 billion
compared to US$ 180 billion. The
information on trade measures was
published on a new area of the WTO
website dedicated to the COVID-19
pandemic, along with members’
proposals related to the pandemic,

INTRODUCTION

and a series of papers by WTO
Secretariat officials looking into
different aspects of the pandemic’s
impact on global trade.
Other aspects of WTO work continued
despite COVID-19 restrictions.
Eleven dispute settlement reports and
decisions were circulated in 2020,
including a long-awaited report on
tobacco plain packaging. However,
the system’s appeals function
remained blocked.

www.wto.org

Echoing trends in the wider economy,
the pandemic accelerated the
move online for the WTO’s training
programmes for government officials
from developing countries. In 2020,
over 13,500 participants benefited
from these activities, including new
e-learning courses. The WTO
also continued to support multiagency programmes, such as the
Enhanced Integrated Framework,
a provider of policy diagnostics and
targeted funding to least-developed
countries. In addition, our Aid for
Trade work programme was adapted
to reflect the economic impact
of COVID-19 and to respond to
members’ needs.
Looking ahead to 2021, the WTO
can and must play a critical role in
accelerating COVID-19 vaccine
production and in ensuring a strong,
sustained, and inclusive global
economic recovery. To live up to its
founding objectives of using trade to
help people – to raise living standards,

008

create jobs, and promote sustainable
development – the WTO must deliver
results this year. By responding
together to a global crisis without
precedent in our lifetimes, members
can begin to rebuild the trust needed
to address future challenges.
Between now and MC12, WTO
members can contribute to vaccine
equity by freeing up vaccine supply
chains and improving access to raw
materials, working with manufacturers
to increase production volumes and
investment in new manufacturing
capacity in developing countries,
and finding pragmatic solutions to
questions of technology transfer,
know-how, and intellectual property,
including the proposed TRIPS waiver.
Another key deliverable for 2021 is
a long-awaited agreement on curbing
harmful fisheries subsidies. This will be
critical for marine sustainability and for
the WTO’s credibility as a negotiating
forum – one where members are
capable of jointly addressing problems
of the global commons.
For many members, a successful
MC12 will have to include meaningful
outcomes on agriculture. By building
on their discussions over the past
year on public stockholding, export
restrictions for humanitarian
purchases by the World Food
Programme, transparency, and
domestic support, members can
bolster food security, enhance
predictability around applied tariffs,

The multilateral trading system has played

and lay a foundation for subsequent
work to reduce distortions in
agricultural production and trade.
Finding a path forward on dispute
settlement will be necessary to place
rule-making at the WTO on a firmer
footing. I hope that members will be
able to agree this year at least on the
contours of the changes they wish to
see in how the system operates.
And finally, groups of WTO members
have made substantial progress in
areas such as investment facilitation,
e-commerce, and services domestic
regulation, as well as on empowering
women and small businesses in the
global economy. Two new initiatives on
trade and environmental sustainability
were launched last year, one looking
at a wide range of issues including
climate change, and the other focused
on plastics pollution. Participating
members can use these initiatives to
agree on rules where international

A N N U A L R E P O R T 2 0 21

frameworks are currently weak or
absent, and to harness the power on
trade for environmental sustainability
and greater social inclusion.
On a personal note, I would like to
thank WTO members for appointing
me to serve as the seventh DirectorGeneral of this institution. I am
honoured by the trust you have placed
in me, and will continue to do my
utmost to help members reform and
revitalize the WTO, and ensure that it
continues to deliver for people around
the world.

INTRODUCTION

Understanding the WTO
Who we are
Improving people’s lives
The fundamental goal of the WTO is to
improve the welfare of people around the
world. The WTO’s founding Marrakesh
agreement recognizes that trade should be
conducted with a view to raising standards
of living, ensuring full employment,
increasing real income and expanding global
trade in goods and services while allowing
for the optimal use of the world’s resources.

www.wto.org

Negotiating trade rules
The WTO was born out of five decades of
negotiations aimed at progressively reducing
obstacles to trade. Where countries have
faced trade barriers and wanted them
lowered, the negotiations have helped to
open markets for trade. Conversely, in
some circumstances, WTO rules support
maintaining trade barriers – for example,
to protect consumers or the environment.
Overseeing WTO agreements
At its heart are the WTO agreements,
negotiated and signed by the bulk of
the world’s trading nations. Essentially
contracts, these documents provide the
rules for international commerce and
bind governments to keep their trade
policies within agreed limits. Their goal

010

is to help producers of goods and services,
exporters and importers conduct their
business, with a view to raising standards
of living, while allowing governments to
meet social and environmental objectives.
Maintaining open trade
The system’s overriding purpose is to
help trade flow as freely as possible –
provided there are no undesirable side
effects – because this stimulates economic
growth and employment and supports the
integration of developing countries into the
international trading system. Its rules have to
be transparent and predictable, to ensure that
individuals, companies and governments know
what the trade rules are around the world, and
to assure them that there will be no sudden
changes of policy.
Settling disputes
Trade relations often involve conflicting
interests. Agreements, including those
painstakingly negotiated in the WTO, often
need interpreting. The most harmonious
way to settle these differences is through a
neutral procedure based on an agreed legal
foundation. That is the purpose behind the
dispute settlement process written into the
WTO agreements.

-----------------------Page 12 End-----------------------

INTRODUCTION

What we stand for
The WTO agreements are lengthy and complex because they are legal texts covering a wide
range of activities. But certain simple, fundamental principles run throughout all of these
documents and form the foundations of the multilateral trading system.

1

Non-discrimination
A country should
not discriminate
between its
trading partners,
and it should not
discriminate between
its own and foreign
products, services
or nationals.

2

Opening trade
Lowering trade barriers
is an obvious way
to encourage trade;
these barriers include
customs duties (or
tariffs) and measures
such as import bans
or quotas, that restrict
quantities selectively.

4

Fair competition
Discouraging “unfair”
practices, such as export
subsidies and dumping
products at below normal
value to gain market share;
the issues are complex,
and the rules try to establish
what is fair or unfair, and
how governments can
respond, in particular
by charging additional
import duties calculated to
compensate for damage
caused by unfair trade.

7

Inclusion
The WTO seeks to build
a more inclusive trading
system that will allow
more women and small
businesses to participate
in trade and to reap the
economic benefits of
global trading.

3

Predictability and transparency
Foreign companies, investors and
governments should be confident
that trade barriers will not be
raised arbitrarily. With stability
and predictability, investment is
encouraged, jobs are created
and consumers can fully enjoy the
benefits of competition – such as
increased choice and lower prices.

5

Support for less
developed countries
Over three-quarters
of WTO members are
developing economies
or in transition to market
economies. The WTO
agreements give them
transition periods to adjust
to WTO provisions and,
in the case of the Trade
Facilitation Agreement,
provide for practical
support for implementation
of the Agreement.

6

Protection of the environment
The WTO agreements
permit members to take
measures to protect not
only public, animal and
plant health but also the
environment. However,
these measures must be
applied in the same way to
both national and foreign
businesses: members
must not use environmental
protection measures as
a means of introducing
discriminatory trade barriers.

8

Partnerships
The WTO maintains
regular dialogue with civil
society, labour unions,
universities and the
business community to
enhance cooperation and
build partnerships. The
WTO’s Trade Dialogues
initiative and the annual
Public Forum provide a
platform for civil society
and business groups
to discuss the latest
developments in world
trade and to propose
ways of enhancing the
multilateral trading system.

9

Digital trade
The WTO recognizes
the growing importance
of e-commerce. Periodic
reviews of the WTO’s work
programme on e-commerce
are conducted by the
General Council based on
reports from various WTO
bodies. In addition, a group
of like-minded members are
conducting negotiations on
e-commerce, with a view
to developing global digital
trade rules and addressing
challenges posed by the
digital divide.

www.wto.org

•	 The WTO is run by its members.
All major decisions are made by
the membership as a whole, either
by ministers (who usually meet at
least once every two years) or by
their ambassadors or delegates
(who meet regularly in Geneva).
•	 While the WTO is driven by its
members, it could not function
without its Secretariat to
coordinate the activities.
•	 The Secretariat employs over 600
staff, and its experts – lawyers,
economists, statisticians and
communications specialists – assist
WTO members on a daily basis to
ensure, among other things, that
negotiations progress smoothly, and
that the rules of international trade
are correctly applied and enforced.

Trade negotiations
The WTO agreements cover goods,
services and intellectual property.
They spell out the principles of tradeopening and the permitted exceptions,
and set procedures for settling disputes.
They include countries’ commitments
to lower trade barriers and to open
services markets. The agreements
are renegotiated from time to time
and new agreements can be added,
as was the case at the 2013 and
2015 ministerial conferences.

-----------------------Page 14 End-----------------------

INTRODUCTION

Implementation
and monitoring
The WTO agreements require
governments to make their trade policies
transparent by notifying the WTO about
laws in force and measures adopted.
Various WTO councils and committees
seek to ensure that these requirements
are being followed and that WTO
agreements are being properly
implemented. All WTO members must
undergo periodic scrutiny of their trade
policies and practices.

Supporting development
and building trade capacity
The WTO agreements contain special
provisions for developing countries,
including longer time periods to implement
agreements and commitments, measures
to increase their trading opportunities,
and support to help them build their
trade capacity, handle disputes and
implement technical standards. The WTO
organizes many technical cooperation
missions to developing countries and
holds numerous courses in Geneva for
government officials. The Aid for Trade
initiative aims to help developing countries
develop the skills and infrastructure
needed to expand their trade.

Dispute settlement
The WTO’s procedure for resolving trade
disputes under the Dispute Settlement
Understanding is vital for enforcing the
rules and therefore for ensuring that trade
flows smoothly. Countries bring disputes
to the WTO if they think their rights under
the WTO agreements are being infringed.
Judgments by specially appointed
independent experts are based on
interpretations of the WTO agreements
and individual countries’ commitments.

Outreach
The WTO maintains regular dialogue
with the business community, nongovernmental organizations, labour
unions, parliamentarians, the academic
community, other international
organizations, parliamentarians, other
international organizations, the media and
the general public on various aspects
of the WTO and its negotiations, with
the aim of enhancing cooperation and
increasing awareness of WTO activities.

A YEAR IN REVIEW

Our year
	 The selection process for a new Director-General, launched in May 2020,

culminated in February 2021 with the appointment of Dr Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala,
the first African and first woman to hold the post.
	 The WTO undertook comprehensive monitoring of governments’ trade

measures relating to COVID-19. The General Council acted as the main forum
for WTO members to share information and to highlight concerns about the
impact of the pandemic.
	 WTO members advanced negotiations on fisheries subsidies and agriculture

while initiatives on e-commerce, investment facilitation and domestic regulation
of services drew interest from an increasing number of participants.
	 The General Council decided that the 12th WTO Ministerial Conference

(MC12), originally due to be held in Kazakhstan in 2020, would take place from
30 November 2021 in Geneva. WTO members agreed that achieving outcomes
at, if not before, MC12 was essential to support economic recovery and restore
confidence in the WTO system.

Trade negotiations and discussions
	WTO members advanced negotiations on fisheries subsidies although progress was
insufficient to secure a deal in 2020.
	A high degree of engagement was seen in the agriculture negotiations.
	The joint initiatives – on e-commerce, investment facilitation, domestic regulation of
services trade, and micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) – drew interest
from an increasing number of WTO members. In November, two new environmental
initiatives were launched.

W

TO members sought to conclude
negotiations on disciplines for
harmful fisheries subsidies by the
12th Ministerial Conference (MC12), originally
set for June 2020. Despite restrictions due to
COVID-19, and the postponement of MC12,
good progress was achieved. A draft text,
issued by the chair in June, was used as
the basis for the negotiations, with revisions
released in November and December.
Members said they were committed to
maintaining the negotiating momentum in 2021.
In agriculture, the chair named facilitators
to help narrow gaps in negotiating positions.
The pandemic heightened WTO members’
interest in areas such as domestic subsidies,
public stockpiling and export restrictions.
Members continued to emphasize the
importance of an agricultural outcome
at MC12.
Coordinators of the joint initiatives reported
good progress on their discussions.
Participants in the joint initiative on investment
facilitation launched negotiations for a
multilateral framework in September, with
the aim of achieving a concrete outcome

by MC12. The e-commerce co-conveners
released a consolidated negotiating text in
December reflecting the latest progress made
in their negotiations.
The chair of negotiations on services
domestic regulation circulated a “far
advanced” negotiating text in December while
the Informal Working Group on MSMEs
issued a set of six recommendations to help
small businesses trade more internationally.
Two new initiatives were launched by
groups of members in November to intensify
discussions on plastics pollution and on trade
and environmental sustainability.
WTO members pointed out that efforts
towards effective and inclusive reform of the
organization had to continue and accelerate.
Building a solid economic recovery and
restoring confidence in the WTO system
required members to achieve outcomes at,
if not before, MC12. Only through ongoing
trade reform could members build a more
resilient trading system, they emphasized.

A YEAR IN REVIEW

Implementation of
WTO agreements and
trade monitoring
	The selection process to appoint a new
Director-General, launched in June 2020,
resulted in Dr Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala being
unanimously selected in February 2021,
making her the first African and first
woman to hold the post.
	Global trade in goods and services was
severely impacted by COVID-19. The
WTO undertook extensive monitoring of
the measures taken by WTO members to
mitigate the crisis.

F

ollowing the decision of Roberto
Azevêdo in May 2020 to step down
as Director-General, General Council
Chair David Walker led the selection
process for a new DG. After several rounds
of consultations with WTO members,
he announced on 15 February 2021 that
Dr Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala of Nigeria had
been selected from the eight candidates put
forward by their respective governments.
The General Council acted as the main forum
for WTO members to share information on
trade measures related to COVID-19 and
to issue statements on questions concerning
the pandemic.
The WTO undertook comprehensive
monitoring of governments’ measures
relating to COVID-19. In its report issued in
December 2020, it noted that WTO members
had implemented 335 measures directly
linked to COVID-19 since the start of the
pandemic. These included 195 measures
considered as trade-facilitating, covering an
estimated US$ 227 billion of goods trade,
and 140 considered to be trade-restrictive
covering trade worth US$ 180 billion.

024

Around 39 per cent of the restrictive
measures had been repealed by mid-October.

93

Over 93 per cent
of WTO members
had ratified the
Trade Facilitation
Agreement by the
end of 2020.

7

Dr Ngozi OkonjoIweala is the
WTO’s seventh
Director-General.

5.3

Merchandise trade
declined by 5.3 per
cent in 2020.

The WTO also produced information notes
on the impact of COVID-19 on world trade
and published regular trade data updates
on a dedicated area of the WTO website.
Originally scheduled for June 2020 in
Kazakhstan, the 12th Ministerial Conference
(MC12) was postponed due to the pandemic.
On 1 March 2021, the General Council
decided that MC12 would take place in
Geneva in the week of 29 November 2021.
By the end of 2020, over 93 per cent of
WTO members had ratified the Trade
Facilitation Agreement (TFA), with the rate
of implementation of TFA commitments
standing at just under 70 per cent for
the entire WTO. A number of members
highlighted the importance of the TFA in
ensuring that essential goods to combat
COVID-19 can cross borders and reach
their intended recipients quickly.
Merchandise trade declined by 5.3 per cent
in 2020, less than foreseen earlier in the
year. This can partly be explained by the
announcement of new COVID-19 vaccines
in November, which contributed to improved
business and consumer confidence, and
the quick action by many governments to
provide fiscal and monetary support
to help mitigate the economic effects
of the pandemic. Trade in services was
particularly hard hit, with travel services
down 63 per cent and transport down
19 per cent in 2020.

Dispute
settlement
	WTO members initiated five disputes in
2020, down from 20 in 2019. On average,
37 panel and arbitral proceedings were
ongoing each month.
	Eleven dispute settlement reports and
decisions were circulated, including the
Appellate Body report on the tobacco plain
packaging dispute.
	WTO members could not reach
consensus on launching the selection
process for the appointment of new
Appellate Body members. As of 30
November 2020, all positions on the
Appellate Body were vacant, meaning
that no new appeals could be heard
in 2020.

T

he five requests for consultation in
2020 – the first stage in the dispute
settlement process – was the lowest
number of disputes initiated in a calendar year
since the inception of the WTO in 1995. The
number of 11 dispute settlement reports and
decisions circulated in 2020 was down from
23 in 2019.

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic and
in cooperation with the parties involved in
the disputes, a number of dispute settlement
panels and arbitrators used additional written
procedures or remote technology to advance
work, including in some cases to substitute
for in-person meetings.
The Dispute Settlement Body established
panels in seven proceedings. In addition,
a so-called “compliance” panel was
established to determine whether China
had complied with previous recommendations
and rulings in “China – Domestic Support for
Agricultural Producers”, a case brought by
the United States.
Three Appellate Body reports relating to four
disputes were circulated in 2020, including
the extensive “Australia – Tobacco Plain
Packaging” dispute. Five appeal proceedings
were initiated in 2020. However, as the
Appellate Body had already been reduced to
one member as of December 2019, no new
appeals could be heard in 2020.
As of 30 November 2020, all seven positions
on the Appellate Body were vacant. WTO
members could not reach consensus on
launching the selection processes for the
appointment of new Appellate Body members.
As of December 2020, 16 appeals were
pending before the Appellate Body.
By the end of the year, a total of 598 disputes
had been initiated under the WTO dispute
settlement procedures since the entry into
force of the WTO agreements in 1995.

37

In 2020, there was
an average of 37
ongoing panel and
arbitral proceedings
each month.

Eleven dispute
settlement reports
and decisions were

Supporting
development and
building trade
capacity
	The Committee on Trade and
Development discussed the decline
in exports for many WTO members
due to COVID-19. Developing countries
with limited resources were the
most affected.
	Global disbursements of Aid for
Trade rose to US$ 45.1 billion in 2018
compared with US$ 43.4 billion in 2017.

I

n the first half of 2020, merchandise
exports of least-developed countries
(LDCs) declined by 16 per cent, steeper
than the 13 per cent decline for world
exports. LDC exports dropped significantly
for fuels and mining products (down 26
per cent) and clothing (down 18 per cent)
while their services exports dropped by
around 40 per cent, mostly due to a slump
in travel exports. LDCs highlighted the need
for global cooperation to help them recover
from the COVID-19 crisis, including through
assistance for healthcare systems and
economic recovery.
The total amount of Aid for Trade disbursed
to developing countries reached US$ 455.5
billion by the end of 2018. Disbursements
to LDCs rose from US$ 12.8 billion in 2017
to US$ 13.5 billion in 2018. However,
increasingly, support for LDCs is taking the

026

form of loans rather than grants, which raises
debt sustainability concerns.
The 2020-21 Aid for Trade Work Programme,
entitled “Empowering Connected, Sustainable
Trade” and adopted by the Committee on Trade
and Development, was extended until 2022,
when the next Aid for Trade Global Review
will be held. The programme is focusing on
the opportunities that digital connectivity and
sustainability offer for economic and export
diversification. Members agreed to adapt the
programme to reflect the economic impact
of COVID-19.
The Enhanced Integrated Framework (EIF),
a multi-agency initiative, maintained support
to LDCs thanks to a business continuity plan
that ensured the delivery of over 90 per cent
of its planned projects for 2020. A total of 28
new projects worth US$ 21.3 million were
approved in 2020.
Another multi-agency initiative, the Standards
and Trade Development Facility (STDF),
approved US$ 3.7 million for projects aimed
at improving food safety, animal and plant
health and helping developing countries
meet sanitary and phytosanitary requirements
for world trade. Africa continued to be the
biggest beneficiary of STDF projects.
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the
WTO developed remotely-delivered training
activities and increased the number of
e-learning courses offered to government
officials. Approximately 13,500 participants
benefited from these activities, including from
the new e-learning courses.

SPOTLIGHT

Director-General selection process
The process for the appointment of a new Director-General was launched in May 2020 after the
then Director-General, Roberto Azevêdo, announced he would step down on 31 August 2020 –
a year before the end of his term. The selection process culminated in February 2021 with the
appointment of Dr Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, the first African and first woman to hold the post.

T
The nomination
period ran from
8 June to 8 July 2020.

he process was led by the
General Council Chair, David
Walker (New Zealand), and
conducted in three phases: phase
1, the nomination period; phase 2,
when candidates made themselves
known to WTO members, including
at a special General Council meeting;
and phase 3, the consultation period
with members. In phase 3, the General
Council Chair was assisted by the
Chair of the Dispute Settlement Body,
Dacio Castillo (Honduras), and the
Chair of the Trade Policy Review
Body, Harald Aspelund (Iceland).

Period of nomination
The nomination period ran from 8
June to 8 July 2020. The following
eight candidates were nominated
by their respective governments: Dr
Jesús Seade Kuri (Mexico); Dr Ngozi
Okonjo-Iweala (Nigeria); Abdel-Hamid

Mamdouh (Egypt); Tudor Ulianovschi
(Republic of Moldova); Yoo Myunghee (Republic of Korea); Amina C.
Mohamed (Kenya); Mohammad Maziad
Al-Tuwaijri (Kingdom of Saudi Arabia);
and Dr Liam Fox (United Kingdom).
Presentation of candidates
Candidates were given the opportunity
to make themselves known to WTO
members and to engage in discussion
on the issues facing the organization.
Due to the global COVID-19
pandemic, the General Council
shortened this normally three-month
period to two months. A special
General Council meeting was
held on 15-17 July, at which WTO
members met formally with the
eight candidates. Each candidate
made a presentation with their
vision for the WTO and responded
to questions.

Consultations
Consultations to narrow the field of
candidates and ultimately to arrive
at the membership’s choice were
conducted by Ambassador Walker,
assisted by Ambassador Castillo and
Ambassador Aspelund. They were
often referred to as “the Troika”.
Three rounds of consultations
were held, with three candidates
withdrawing after the first round
and three more after the second
round. This left just two candidates
– Dr Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala and Yoo
Myung-hee – remaining in the third and
final round.
The outcome of each round was
reported to members at heads of
delegation meetings on 18 September,
8 October and 28 October. The
General Council Chair praised the
membership for remaining fully engaged
in and committed to this process. On
28 October, the General Council
Chair announced that, based on
consultations with all delegations,
the candidate best placed to attain
consensus and become the next
Director-General was Dr Ngozi
Okonjo-Iweala. Ambassador Walker
stressed that this was the assessment
of the Troika and that a final decision
had to be taken by members at a
General Council meeting scheduled
for 9 November. That meeting was
subsequently postponed until further
notice “for reasons including the
health situation and current events”,
Ambassador Walker said.

Background

Twenty-three countries
and customs territories
are seeking to join
the WTO.

032

The WTO is open to states or
customs territories with full autonomy
over their external commercial
relations. To join, a government has
to bring its economic and trade
policies in line with WTO rules and
principles and negotiate with WTO
members the guaranteed minimum
levels of access to its domestic
markets for goods and services.
The accession process promotes
the integration of new members into
the global economy. It begins when
WTO members accept an application
and establish a working party. It
concludes when WTO members and
the acceding government accept
negotiated terms of accession.

Working party for Curaçao

A working party for Curaçao was established
in March 2020, taking to 23 the number
of working parties overseeing accession
negotiations for countries seeking to join the
WTO. Since the WTO was launched in 1995,
36 members have joined the organization.
Curaçao is a constituent country and separate
customs territory within the Kingdom of
the Netherlands. It applied for accession in
October 2019. “We will actively support the
role of the WTO in organizing and nurturing
effective global economic governance,
especially where it concerns the interests
of small island developing states within the
WTO,” said Caryl M.C. Monte, Curaçao’s
Chief Negotiator for WTO accession.
Timor-Leste formally starts its
accession process

The first meeting of the Working Party on
the Accession of Timor-Leste in October
2020 reviewed the data provided by the
country on its trade regime. The WTO
Secretariat was mandated to prepare a factual
summary of the discussions to date, which will
form the basis for further negotiations. TimorLeste submitted its application for accession
in November 2016. The working party was
established in December 2016.
“Timor-Leste prioritizes WTO membership
as it would help to leverage the ongoing
improvements in its infrastructure, human
capital and administrative capacity, and
to accelerate growth and economic
diversification,” said Joaquim Amaral,
Coordinating Minister of Economic Affairs
and WTO chief negotiator.
Ethiopia and Uzbekistan reactivate

Members welcomed the resumption of
Ethiopia’s WTO membership negotiations at
the fourth meeting of the working party on the

urged members to accelerate negotiations in
consideration of Ethiopia’s status as a leastdeveloped country (LDC).

A working party

The first Regional Dialogue on WTO
Accessions for the Arab Region was
organized in collaboration with the Arab
Monetary Fund and the Islamic Development
Bank in November on “Arab Perspectives on
WTO Accessions and the Multilateral Trading
System”. The virtual workshop provided a
platform for increasing knowledge of the
WTO accession process, accession-related
rules and the state of play of Arab accessions.
The ninth China Round Table on WTO
Accessions took place virtually in December.
Under the theme “25 years of WTO
accessions in review”, it paid tribute to the
contribution of accessions to the organization
since its establishment in 1995. It also
discussed how to make WTO membership
universal and what more can be done to
assist the most vulnerable countries seeking
WTO accession.
Under the “Trade for Peace through WTO
Accessions” initiative, in December the
Secretariat hosted the first edition of the

A N N U A L R E P O R T 2 0 21

Trade for Peace Week. The discussions
highlighted the impact of trade, job creation
and technology on peace-building.
In remarks at the opening session, DDG
Alan Wolff said the initiative could contribute
to making the trading system more agile,
responsive, humane and fit for purpose.
There was much more that the trade and
peace communities could and must do
together, he added.

Trade negotiations and
discussions in 2020
	The COVID-19 pandemic forced
WTO negotiating bodies to adopt a
variety of formats for work, including
virtual meetings.
	WTO members advanced negotiations on
fisheries subsidies, although progress
was insufficient to secure a deal in 2020.
A high degree of engagement was seen
in the agriculture negotiations.
	The joint initiatives continued to draw
interest from an increasing number
of members in 2020. Their processes
remained transparent and inclusive.
	In February 2021, Dr Ngozi OkonjoIweala of Nigeria was selected as the
WTO’s Director-General to succeed
Roberto Azevêdo, who stood down as
DG and Chair of the Trade Negotiations
Committee at the end of August 2020.

Background
Trade negotiations take
place under the Trade
Negotiations Committee
(TNC) and its subsidiary
bodies, which are councils
and committees meeting
in special session or other
bodies especially created
for negotiations. The TNC
supervises the overall
conduct of negotiations.

COVID-19 pandemic

In mid-March 2020, in line with the Swiss
Government’s recommendations, the then
Director-General and Chair of the Trade
Negotiations Committee (TNC), Roberto
Azevêdo, suspended all meetings at the
WTO, in coordination with the General
Council Chair, until the end of April because
of the COVID-19 pandemic. In the months
that followed, the WTO continued its
meetings through a variety of formats –
in-person (with limited numbers of
delegations), fully virtual or hybrid.
In April, May and July, DG Azevêdo
reported to heads of delegation on the
WTO Secretariat’s efforts to respond to the
pandemic and his outreach activities. He
pointed out that international cooperation on
trade would be critical to helping all countries

WTO members

-----------------------Page 42 End-----------------------

to build back better, and keeping markets
open to trade would be part of achieving a
post-COVID-19 economic recovery that was
strong, sustainable and inclusive.
While the immediate challenge was to fight
the pandemic and save lives, WTO members
emphasized the importance of keeping
international trade flowing. Concerns were
expressed about export restrictions on
medical supplies and food. All delegations
stressed that international cooperation and
coordination of responses were important.
Various members and groups issued
declarations, statements and proposals on
trade and COVID-19 – highlighting challenges
faced, actions needed or actions they had
taken in response to the pandemic.
Members continued to emphasize the critical
importance of transparency and informationsharing on trade-related COVID-19
measures. As part of its longstanding
monitoring and transparency mandate, the
WTO Secretariat continued to track trade

measures related to COVID-19 – both tradefacilitating and trade-restrictive. A Secretariat
task force was set up to monitor how the
pandemic was affecting international trade,
and a dedicated area on the WTO website
was created to provide up-to-the minute
trade-related information on COVID-19.

A number of new
initiatives and
proposals by groups
of WTO members
was discussed at
meetings of the
Trade Negotiations
Committee.

The WTO worked closely with other
intergovernmental organizations, including
the UN Food and Agricultural Organization
(FAO) and the World Health Organization
(WHO), and with international business
organizations to encourage effective policy
responses to the COVID-19 crisis. The
WTO also brought together six multilateral
development banks to issue a joint statement
in support of trade finance markets
(see page 131).
Several new initiatives or proposals by
groups of members were highlighted and
discussed at TNC meetings. These
included an initiative on trade and health
(see page 69) and a waiver to certain
provisions of the Agreement on Trade-related
Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights
(TRIPS) for the prevention, containment and
treatment of COVID-19 (see page 113).
Negotiating work in 2020

In 2019, WTO members had looked to the
12th Ministerial Conference (MC12) as the
new target date for reaching agreement on
eliminating subsidies to illegal, unregulated,
unreported (IUU) fishing and prohibiting
certain subsidies that contribute to overfishing
and overcapacity, giving due consideration to
special and differential treatment (S&D) for
developing countries. MC12 was due to be
held in Kazakhstan in June 2020 but it was
postponed due to the pandemic until the
end of 2021.

Fisheries was a key negotiating priority in 2020.
Members worked intensively in the Rules
Negotiating Group (see page 53) under the
leadership of Santiago Wills (Colombia).
Ambassador Wills issued a draft consolidated
text which he revised twice. Despite all efforts,
work could not be completed by the year’s
end. While this was a setback, the Chair
said that the mandate remained unchanged.
He said members should be encouraged by
progress made, the momentum built and the
opportunity to conclude the negotiations in
the near future.
A high level of engagement was seen in the
agriculture negotiations. Members continued to
emphasize the importance of an agricultural
outcome at MC12 to preserve the credibility
and relevance of the organization. The
challenge in 2021 would be to build consensus
for an ambitious and balanced outcome.
On the S&D negotiations, the G90 group
of developing countries circulated a
communication containing their ten
agreement-specific proposals on S&D and
another with their responses to questions.
Positions did not change (see page 51).

(Kazakhstan), reported on exploratory
discussions on market access, which focused
on environmental services, agriculture-related
services, logistics services and financial
services. She will continue her consultations
with the membership in 2021, including on
any new proposals that are tabled.

There was limited activity or no progress in
the other multilateral negotiations.
Work on the joint initiatives

The joint initiatives continued to draw
interest from an increasing number of WTO
members in 2020. Their processes remained
transparent and inclusive, with open meetings
and all proposals and reports made available
to all members.
Some participants said that the imperative
for initiatives in e-commerce, domestic
regulation in services, investment facilitation
for development, and micro, small and
medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) had been
strengthened by the pandemic, and that the
WTO needed to show that it could respond to
crises and 21st century issues.
The co-convenors and coordinators of the
initiatives provided updates on their work.
The initiatives cover electronic commerce
(see page 57), investment facilitation for
development (see page 58), domestic
regulation in services (see page 61) and
MSMEs (see page 59). Members also
received updates on trade and women’s
economic empowerment (see page 64). In
November, two groups of members launched
initiatives to intensify discussions on important
environmental challenges at the WTO (see
page 62).

WTO reform discussions

At July’s TNC meeting – the last chaired by
DG Azevêdo before he stepped down at
the end of August – the Chair noted that all
international organizations were working to
update themselves to remain fit for purpose
amid changing economic and geopolitical
circumstances. The WTO could not afford
to be an exception.
WTO members pointed out that efforts
towards effective and inclusive reform had
to continue and accelerate. A key challenge
was the different perspectives on what was
required. Building a solid economic recovery
and restoring confidence in the WTO system
required members to achieve outcomes at,
if not before, MC12. Only through ongoing
trade reform could members build a more
resilient trading system.
Many members said that reaching a solution
on the Appellate Body impasse (see
page 142) had to be a top priority. Some
delegations stressed that WTO reform should
promote inclusivity, address historical balances,
enhance the integration of developing
countries in global trade and deliver on the
development mandate.

meetings. Two TNC/HoDs meetings – in
October and December – were convened by
the four Deputy DGs (Yonov Frederick Agah
of Nigeria, Karl Brauner of Germany, Alan
Wolff of the United States and Yi Xiaozhun
of China) in coordination with the General
Council Chair.

Dr Ngozi OkonjoIweala was selected
as Director-General
in February 2021.

On 15 February 2021, WTO members made
history when the General Council agreed
by consensus to select Dr Ngozi OkonjoIweala, a former Nigerian finance minister and
senior official at the World Bank, as DirectorGeneral. Dr Okonjo-Iweala becomes the first
woman and the first African to hold the post.

Dr Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala selected as DG

On 14 May 2020, DG Azevêdo told Heads
of Delegation (HoDs) that he was stepping
down as Director-General and Chair of the
Trade Negotiations Committee on 31 August
2020 – one year earlier than his mandate. His
early departure would reduce the chances
that the process to appoint his successor in
2021 would divert attention and energy from
preparations for MC12, he said.
In October, the Chair of the General Council
said until a new Director-General was in
place (see page 28), it would be important
to follow a “no-surprises” approach. This
included continuing to provide transparency
and inclusiveness through the meetings of
the TNC/HoDs ahead of General Council

Negotiations resumed in September despite
COVID-related constraints. Several new
submissions were presented by members and
examined. Members notably discussed how
to factor in lessons learnt from the COVID-19
crisis. Enhancing transparency was also a
cross-cutting issue.

Background
The broad objective of the
agriculture negotiations
is to reduce distortions in
agricultural trade caused
notably by high tariffs and
domestic support measures
as well as export subsidies
and equivalent measures
and export restrictions.
The negotiations take
place in the WTO
Committee on Agriculture,
meeting in special session.
They are also to take into
account the needs of
developing countries.

The new Chair put in place in October a
facilitator-led process on the various topics.
The facilitators assist the Chair with technical
work to clarify and enhance understanding
of the issues and concerns, to narrow gaps
in positions and to help identify the different
options available. The facilitators held
numerous consultations in various formats.
Public stockholding for food
security purposes

During the pandemic, several members
revived, enhanced or expanded purchases
at market or administered (official) prices
under their public stockholding programmes
for food security or increased procurement
prices. Discussions on public stockholding
for food security continued in dedicated
sessions. The issue has remained a priority
for developing country proponents, who have
demanded a permanent solution to guarantee
their food security.

Members discussed

lessons learnt
from the
COVID-19 crisis.

A N N U A L R E P O R T 2 0 21

-----------------------Page 46 End-----------------------

Other members warned of the potential for
production and trade distortion, as well as
for excessive accumulation of stocks under
these programmes; if released on world
markets, the stocks could depress prices
and affect trade flows and the food security
of others. They continued to call for stronger
safeguards, anti-circumvention provisions and
enhanced transparency.
The G-33 (a coalition of developing countries)
has called for a permanent solution on the
issue to be agreed at MC12. The group wants
to avoid transparency and other obligations
that would be too burdensome. A previous
deadline for agreement was missed at MC11.
Domestic support

Domestic support (subsidies) was considered
to be the priority issue by the overwhelming
majority of WTO members, who continued
to call for disciplining trade-distorting
support and securing an outcome at MC12.
Many members adopted domestic support
measures or increased support under
existing programmes during the year to
help their farmers cope with the economic
consequences of the pandemic, which
heightened interest in the issue.
Several new submissions were made by
members. The Cairns Group of agricultural

A N N U A L R E P O R T 2 0 21

exporters proposed a framework for
negotiations on domestic support aiming to
agree on a numerical target for a reduction
in trade-distorting support entitlements by
2030. Russia introduced a new submission
on its formula approach to further discipline
trade-distorting support. Canada updated its
analytical tool on domestic support, which
allows countries to do their own analysis.
The United States drew attention to different
methodologies used to calculate market
price support.
Several members continued to argue that
aggregate measurement support (AMS)
entitlements (i.e. final bound total AMS) that
allow certain members to provide support
above their de minimis levels should be
eliminated first to establish a level playing
field. De minimis refers to minimal amounts of
trade-distorting domestic support (expressed
as a percentage of the value of agricultural
production) allowed for all members.
Others believe that all components of
trade-distorting support should be examined
concurrently. An increasing number of
members called for some kind of proportionality
– those with more potential to distort global
markets should contribute more to the reform.
Many members also continued to call for the
negotiations to take account of support
provided on a per capita basis.

-----------------------Page 47 End-----------------------

Cotton

Members agreed to focus the facilitatorled process initally on transparency-related
issues. They observed “Cotton Days” in July
and November, consisting of back-to-back
meetings on trade-related developments and
the Director-General’s Consultative Framework
Mechanism on cotton development assistance.
The framework meetings track development
assistance programmes for cotton and act
as a forum for the exchange of information
on the linkages between cotton, trade and
development. The trade-related dedicated
discussions on cotton, which focus on
transparency and monitoring, benefited from
various external contributions, including from
the International Cotton Advisory Committee
and the International Trade Centre. An
information session on COVID-19 and cotton
was held in July 2020.

(ITC) on cotton by-products, endorsed by
WTO members in November 2018, marked
the end of its first phase with the organization
in September of five workshops in partner
least-developed countries (LDCs). The
initiative also saw the completion of feasibility
studies containing new data and analysis
on the potential to develop the by-products
sector in those countries.
A proposal by the Cotton-4 – Benin,
Burkina Faso, Chad and Mali – and Côte
d’Ivoire for a General Council declaration on
support for cotton by-products development
was discussed at the December General
Council meeting.
Market access

The WTO celebrated the first anniversary of
World Cotton Day on 7 October. Most of the
activities were held online. The objective was
to disseminate information and generate new
and enhanced collaboration throughout cotton
value chains.

Discussions on market access centred on a
few selected issues, targeting an incremental
outcome at MC12. These included applied
tariff predictability and the treatment of
consignments already en route when tariffs
change, tariff quota transparency, tariff
simplification, and a framework for market
access reforms. There was no serious
engagement among members on tariff
reduction commitments.

Intense discussions on the exemption of
foodstuffs purchased for non-commercial
humanitarian purposes by the UN’s World
Food Programme (WFP) from export
prohibitions or restrictions took place towards
the end of the year. A draft decision was
submitted for adoption at the December
General Council meeting but consensus
could not be achieved.
Australia and Canada (later joined by Brazil
and Ukraine) on consignments en route
anchored the discussions on these issues.
The negotiations picked up in the latter
part of the year, supported by the facilitatorled process. Detailed technical discussions
were held on en route consignments, during
which the proponents presented a set of
best practices to improve predictability.
Paraguay, Brazil and Ukraine provided a
broad outline of their proposed market
access reform framework.
Special safeguard mechanism

WTO members continued to discuss a
special safeguard mechanism (SSM) in
dedicated sessions, as mandated by the 10th
Ministerial Conference. A mechanism would
allow developing countries to raise tariffs
temporarily to address import surges or price
declines. Differences among members on
the link between market access and an SSM
continued to constrain progress on this issue.
Export prohibitions and restrictions

The enhancement of transparency in
the imposition of export restrictions and
the monitoring of these measures in the
WTO attracted renewed interest with the
COVID-19 pandemic.

A N N U A L R E P O R T 2 0 21

In January 2021, a group of nearly 80 WTO
members issued a joint statement pledging
not to impose export restrictions on foodstuffs
purchased by the WFP for humanitarian aid.
“We recognize the critical humanitarian support
provided by the World Food Programme,
made more urgent in light of the COVID-19
pandemic and other crises,” the group said.

Enhancing
transparency in the
export restrictions
attracted renewed
interest during

Export competition

A group of proponents circulated in March
2020 a draft proposal for a decision at
MC12 on enhancing transparency in export
competition. This document was considered
a good reference for technical discussions
in the facilitator-led process. While several
members supported work towards improved
transparency, others expressed concerns that
new transparency obligations might be hard to
implement due to resource constraints.

Market access for
non-agricultural products
	The Negotiating Group on Market Access
did not receive any papers or proposals
in 2020 and did not meet during the year.

Background
Non-agricultural products are products not covered by the
Agreement on Agriculture. These range from manufactured
goods to fuels and fisheries. The negotiations aim to reduce
or, as appropriate, eliminate tariffs as well as non-tariff
barriers, particularly on goods of export interest to developing
countries. The negotiations are conducted in the Negotiating
Group on Market Access.

Services
	WTO members held exploratory
discussions on market access for
environmental services, agriculturerelated services, logistics and
financial services.
	The Chair, Zhanar Aitzhanova
(Kazakhstan), encouraged delegations
to continue engaging and to reflect on
how to pursue discussions in 2021.

Background
The General Agreement on
Trade in Services (GATS)
mandates WTO members to
progressively open up trade
in services. The negotiations
are overseen by the Council
for Trade in Services,
meeting in special session.

048

T

he special session of the Council for
Trade in Services discussed four new
communications submitted regarding
exploratory discussions on market access.
The communications covered environmental,
agriculture-related, logistics and financial
services. These discussions, initiated after
the 11th Ministerial Conference in December
2017, aim to foster an exchange of views
among WTO members about their current
areas of interest.
Australia, Canada, Mexico, New Zealand,
Switzerland and the United Kingdom put
forward a communication on market access
issues related to environmental services,
which was originally discussed in 2019.
The new communication covered additional
environment-related services, including
engineering, construction and consulting.
The proponents underscored the positive
linkages between services trade and
environmental protection.
Australia, Canada, Chile, New Zealand
and Uruguay highlighted the importance of
agriculture-related services to agricultural
production and value chains. The liberalization
of agriculture-related services, including
forestry, veterinary and wholesale trade

services, would help mitigate the challenges
of the COVID-19 pandemic by reducing
bottlenecks in food value chains and
strengthening the resilience of food
systems, they said.
China submitted a paper on the economic
importance of logistics services. The paper
outlined the evolution of the sector, its role
in facilitating trade in goods and supply
chains, its contribution to e-commerce
activities, and the relevance of members’
commitments under the General Agreement
on Trade in Services (GATS) in this area.
WTO members also debated a
communication by Australia, Canada,
Switzerland and the United Kingdom on
financial services, which range from insurance
and banking to asset management. The paper
stressed the sector’s role as a key enabler
for economic growth and global trade. It
also drew attention to the possibility for
improvements to market access commitments,

A N N U A L R E P O R T 2 0 21

taking into account the economic, policy and
technological developments the sector has
undergone in recent years.
In discussions, members provided their
views on market access, underscored the
sectors’ economic and trade contributions,
including in the context of efforts to improve
economic resilience and support recovery
from the pandemic, and highlighted
development considerations.

Market access for
environmental services
was one of the topics
discussed by the
Council for Trade
in Services.

In her concluding remarks at a meeting in
December, the Chair, Zhanar Aitzhanova,
encouraged members to “continue engaging
with one another and to reflect on how best to
pursue discussions in the new year”.

A

lfredo Suescum (Panama) was
appointed Chair of the TRIPS Council
special session in July 2020. He
convened consultations in October with the
WTO members who have been most active
in the negotiations on creating a register of
geographical indications (GIs) for wines and
spirits to facilitate the protection of GIs.

Background
Negotiations on a multilateral
system for notifying and
registering geographical
indications (GIs) for wines
and spirits are carried out in
the special session of the
TRIPS Council. The purpose
of the register is to facilitate
the protection of GIs for wines
and spirits. These are indications
(including place names or
other terms or signs associated
with a place) used to identify
products whose place of
origin contributes to their
special qualities, reputation or
other characteristics.

050

Ambassador Suescum invited members
to share their views on changes in their
respective position, the steps they would
propose to take to fulfil the negotiating
mandate and how recent developments
in multilateral, bilateral and regional
agreements and in domestic systems for
the protection of GIs affect the work of the
special session.
In October, an informal meeting was held to
report to the whole membership on the smallgroup consultations. The Chair shared with
delegations that while there was a common
desire to fulfil the existing mandate, members’
positions had not changed. No comments
were made at the meeting.
Members disagree on the legal effects the
register should have and whether it should
create obligations for all WTO members or
only those choosing to participate in it. They
remain divided on product coverage and on
whether, as the negotiating mandate says,
the register should be confined to wines
and spirits, or whether it could also apply to
other products, such as food and agricultural
products. Differences also remain over
whether linkages should be made between
the GI register negotiations and other TRIPSrelated implementation issues (see page 113).

(S&D) refers to the special
treatment, or flexibility, granted
to developing countries in WTO
agreements, such as longer
implementation periods. Many WTO
agreements contain provisions
that give developing countries
special rights and that allow
developed countries to treat them
more favourably than other WTO
members. Differences among WTO
members include the definition
of who exactly should benefit
from S&D. The special session
of the Committee on Trade and
Development is mandated to review
all S&D provisions, with a view to
making them more precise, effective
and operational.

A N N U A L R E P O R T 2 0 21

The proposals relate to S&D provisions –
over 100 in all – contained in several WTO
agreements and decisions on topics including
transfer of technology, technical barriers to
trade, sanitary and phytosanitary measures,
customs valuation and the accession of leastdeveloped countries (LDCs) to the WTO.
The Chair invited WTO members to submit
questions or comments. The G90, which
includes the Organisation of African,
Caribbean and Pacific States (OACPS), the
African Group and the WTO’s LDCs Group,
was then invited to provide written responses,
which were also shared with members.
A formal meeting of the special session
was held in September to allow discussions
to continue.
The Chair reported to the Trade Negotiations
Committee (TNC) in October that reactions
to the G90 proposals continued to be mixed.
Some members were supportive, but others
had concerns.
The Chair told the TNC in December that
there would be more scope to make progress
if further discussions on the G90 proposals
were to take place in an informal setting. She
informed members that, after a preliminary
informal meeting in December, she would
hold five informal consultations starting in early
2021 to explore how to move forward
on the G90 proposals.
In each consultation, she would invite
participants to focus on two proposals.
Over the course of the five consultations,
participants would be able to have an in-depth
discussion on all ten proposals.

Trade and
environment
	The Chair continued to encourage
members to consult him on topics
related to the negotiations.

T

he Chair of the special session of the
Committee on Trade and Environment,
Leopold Samba (Central African
Republic), continued to encourage WTO
members to consult with him on topics related
to the negotiations on trade and environment.
No new consultations or proposals were
made in 2020. Environmental services
are being discussed in the WTO services
negotiations (see page 48).
Following a request by the Least Developed
Countries (LDCs) Group, Ambassador
Samba asked the WTO Secretariat to organize
a workshop on trade and environment for
capital-based representatives of LDCs. The
workshop had to be postponed due to
COVID-19 restrictions and will be held
when conditions allow.
Independently from Committee work, two
groups of members launched in November
new initiatives to intensify discussions at
the WTO on certain trade and environment
topics. The initiatives establish structured
discussions on trade and environmental
sustainability and an informal dialogue on
plastics pollution (see page 62).

052

Background
The negotiations cover the
relationship between existing WTO
rules and specific trade obligations
set out in multilateral environmental
agreements (MEAs), procedures
for regular information exchange
between MEA secretariats and the
relevant WTO committees, and
the reduction or, as appropriate,
elimination of tariff and non-tariff
barriers to trade in environmental
goods and services.

Rules negotiations: Fisheries
subsidies, other WTO rules
	Fisheries subsidies remained the focus of work of the Negotiating
Group on Rules. The group sought to conclude negotiations on
disciplines for harmful fisheries subsidies by the 12th Ministerial
Conference (MC12), originally set for June 2020.
	Despite restrictions on meetings and movement due to
COVID-19, and the postponement of MC12, work continued
throughout the year.
	The Chair introduced a consolidated draft document in mid-2020
which was then used as the basis for the negotiations from that
point. A first revision was released in November and a second
revision in December.
	WTO members said they were committed to maintaining the
negotiating momentum in 2021.

Background
The mandate of the WTO
Negotiating Group on Rules
covers anti-dumping, subsidies
and countervailing measures,
and fisheries subsidies. The UN
Sustainable Development Goals
(SDGs) called for agreement in
the WTO by 2020 on eliminating
subsidies to illegal, unreported and
unregulated fishing and to prohibit
certain subsidies that contribute to
overfishing and overcapacity, with
special and differential treatment for
developing countries. Due to factors
related to COVID-19, an agreement
on fisheries subsidies was not
reached in 2020 but negotiations
are at an advanced stage, with
members aiming to reach an
agreement as early as possible
in 2021.

A

t the end of 2019, the six facilitators
who were assisting the Chair,
Santiago Wills (Colombia), presented
and finalized working papers on different
parts of the negotiations. Work resumed in
2020 drawing on these working papers and
other inputs, with a particular – although not
exclusive – focus on disciplines to prohibit
subsidies that contribute to overfishing
and overcapacity.
Following a number of meetings of the
Negotiating Group at the level of heads of
delegation, the Chair focused on preparing
a single consolidated document to be used
as a starting point for further work. To begin
this process, in early March 2020 the Chair
distributed a suggested text on the prohibition
element of disciplines on overfishing and
overcapacity, based on the group’s previous
work in this area.
COVID-19 and measures taken in Switzerland
and around the world to address the
pandemic made immediate further progress
difficult. On 12 March, it was announced
that MC12 would not be held in June. At
the time, virtual meetings of the Negotiating
Group were not possible because of logistical
and technical issues. Work continued

nevertheless, albeit at a slow pace,
through a written process of comments,
questions and answers on proposals that
had been submitted before the lockdown.
The Chair also continued to hold consultations
with delegations and groups. At a virtual
meeting on 25 June, he introduced a draft
consolidated document containing draft
disciplines along with a detailed explanation
of the origin of each provision.
The draft focused on the core disciplines
of prohibitions for subsidies to illegal,
unreported and unregulated fishing, to
fishing overfished stocks and to overfishing
and overcapacity. In addition, the draft
included terms for the scope of the disciplines
as well as some definitions needed to
understand the disciplines. It also included
a number of square-bracketed provisions,

054

signifying options or areas where there
was no emerging consensus. The document
contained several “placeholders” for
provisions needed for implementation,
such as notifications and transparency
and dispute settlement. Heads of delegation
agreed that the document was a starting
point for resumed negotiations.

“The momentum is there, and we must not
waste it. At this critical juncture, we need
members to close the gaps and deliver a
meaningful agreement soon”- Santiago Wills,
Chair of the fisheries negotiations

Work resumed in September after the summer
break, essentially in continuous mode, with
a week-long meeting cluster each month
punctuated by many meetings in various
formats – from bilateral consultations to small
groups and meetings open to all – at both
technical and heads-of-delegation levels. The
Chair also enlisted the help of Ambassador
Didier Chambovey (Switzerland) as a
“Friend of the Chair” for work on special and
differential treatment for developing countries,
an integral part of the negotiations.
Based on the intensive work of the
Negotiating Group, the Chair circulated
two revisions of the consolidated draft
document, each with an accompanying
explanatory note, in early November and in
mid-December. These revisions filled certain
placeholders and captured progress in the
group’s discussions.

Ambassador Wills said in mid-December
that, despite difficulties caused by COVID-19related disruptions to the talks, real
progress had been made in 2020 and that
members were determined to build on
the progress and bring the negotiations
to a conclusion. “The momentum is there,
and we must not waste it. At this critical
juncture, we need members to close
the gaps and deliver a meaningful agreement
soon,” Ambassador Wills told the Trade
Negotiations Committee at the end of
the year.
At the first meeting of the Negotiating
Group in January 2021, heads of delegations
said they were committed to keeping
up the momentum. They welcomed the
second revision of the draft consolidated
document circulated on 18 December by
the Chair.

Dispute Settlement Understanding
	The Dispute Settlement Body (DSB) did
not meet in special session in 2020.

Background
In November 2001, at
the Doha Ministerial
Conference, WTO members
agreed to negotiate
to improve and clarify
the Dispute Settlement
Understanding – the rules
and procedures governing
the settlement of WTO
disputes. These negotiations
take place in special
sessions of the Dispute
Settlement Body.

056

T

he DSB last met in special session
in November 2019 when some WTO
members signalled that resuming
intense work might not be fruitful. This
was because at that time participants were
focused on more pressing issues, including
broader discussions on the functioning of the
dispute settlement system ongoing in other
WTO bodies.
The Chair, Yackoley Kokou Johnson (Togo),
reiterated his availability to meet with any
delegation that wished to discuss the work
of the special session. In the absence of
indications from delegations that work should
resume, the negotiating group did not meet
in 2020.
In 2019, the special session concluded
focused work on the 12 issues under
consideration in the negotiations, which span
all phases of dispute settlement proceedings
from initiation to completion.

	Trade and environment initiatives

Background
At the 11th Ministerial
Conference in 2017, likeminded groups of WTO
members issued joint
statements on advancing
discussions on e-commerce,
on developing a multilateral
framework on investment
facilitation, on launching a
working group on micro,
small and medium-sized
enterprises (MSMEs), and
on advancing ongoing talks
on domestic regulation in
services trade. Also, over 100
WTO members supported
the Buenos Aires Declaration
on Trade and Women’s
Economic Empowerment,
which led to the launch in
September 2020 of the
Informal Working Group
on Trade and Gender. In
November 2020, two groups
of members launched
initiatives to intensify
discussions on important
environmental challenges at
the WTO. The groups are
open to all WTO members.

n 2020, members of the Joint Statement
on Electronic Commerce focused on small
group meetings on specific issues. Topics
addressed included unsolicited electronic
commercial messages, online consumer
protection, trade facilitation in goods, source
code, open government data, e-authentication
and e-signatures, customs duties, open
internet access and services market access.
The aim was to reduce the number of options
in the negotiating text. Given the restrictions
on in-person meetings and international travel
due to the COVID-19 pandemic, much of the
work was carried out virtually.
Negotiations on trade-related aspects of
e-commerce began in 2019, with the objective
of achieving “a high standard outcome that
builds on existing WTO agreements and
frameworks with the participation of as many
WTO members as possible”. The initiative is
co-convened by Australia, Japan and Singapore.

scheduled to take place in late 2021. They
stressed the importance of developing
global digital trade rules and the critical
role e-commerce would play in the global
economic recovery from COVID-19.
Negotiations are based on members’ textual
proposals. The issues raised in members’
submissions are discussed under six main
themes: enabling e-commerce; openness
and e-commerce; trust and e-commerce;
cross-cutting issues; telecommunications;
and market access.

The joint initiative on investment facilitation
for development aims at fostering a more
transparent, efficient and investmentfriendly business climate.

P

articipants in the joint initiative on
investment facilitation for development
began negotiations in September 2020
on a multilateral framework, with a view to
achieving a concrete outcome by the 12th WTO
Ministerial Conference scheduled for late 2021.
The joint initiative, which aims at fostering a
more transparent, efficient and investmentfriendly business climate, was launched by
70 WTO members in a ministerial statement
in December 2017. In November 2019, 98
members signed another ministerial statement
committing themselves “to intensify work to
further develop the framework for facilitating
foreign direct investments, and work towards
a concrete outcome” at the next Ministerial
Conference. There are currently 106 members
participating in the initiative, which is open to
all WTO members.
The aim of the framework is to improve the
transparency and predictability of investment
measures and to streamline administrative
procedures and requirements. It also aims to
enhance international cooperation, information
sharing and the exchange of best practices.
Facilitating greater participation by developing
and least-developed countries in global
investment flows is a core objective of the
discussions. The initiative does not address
market access, investment protection and
investor-state dispute settlement.

The start of negotiations had initially been
set for March 2020 but was delayed until
September by the COVID-19 pandemic.
From June to September, participating
members completed a thematic review
of the informal consolidated text, which
incorporates all written proposals submitted
by participating members and forms the
basis for the negotiations.
Following the launch of the negotiations in
September, WTO members made important
progress in four negotiating meetings and
two intersessional meetings held between
September and December. In line with the
open, inclusive and transparent nature of
the initiative, all WTO members were invited
to attend.
The Coordinator, Mathias Francke (Chile),
prepared and circulated “revised draft texts”
under his responsibility in those areas where
discussions were more advanced – notably
on transparency of investment measures,
administrative procedures and domestic
regulatory coherence, and cross-border
cooperation. Participants also examined how
to insulate a future framework on investment
facilitation for development from other
international investment agreements, by
means of so-called “firewall” provisions.
At the first meeting in 2021, members taking
part in the initiative endorsed the work plan
for the first half of the year proposed by
the Coordinator. He defined two mid-term
objectives: circulating around Easter time a
text compiling all the revised draft texts put
forward by the Coordinator and discussed
by participating members; and taking stock
of progress and planning for the second
half of the year at a meeting in July 2021.
The work plan also provides a framework
for participants to meet in small groups or
“discussion groups” to accelerate progress
on some key provisions.

Informal Working Group, along with several
non-members, issued a statement in May 2020
in support of MSMEs and their participation in
trade. It was the first of a series of concrete
WTO outcomes specific to MSMEs during
the year.
In the statement, the group said that, in
cooperation with other international
organizations and stakeholders, it will explore
solutions and share good practices to
facilitate trade for MSMEs, accelerate efforts
towards trade digitalization, including access
to digital tools, and improve MSMEs’ access
to trade finance (see page 131) and to traderelated information through online platforms.

and declarations aimed at addressing
challenges smaller businesses face when they
trade internationally. This package, the first
concrete outcome of the 2017 joint initiative,
was formally endorsed in December at the
group’s final meeting of the year. The six
recommendations and declarations are:
•

Conference on Development and Trade
and the WTO to simplify market research
for companies)

•	

a recommendation for full implementation
of the WTO’s Trade Facilitation Agreement
(see page 109) because burdensome
customs procedures can be especially
hard on MSMEs

•	

a recommendation to promote MSME
inclusion in the development of traderelated regulations

•	

a recommendation on MSMEs and the
WTO integrated database supporting the

voluntary submission of tariff and other
trade-related information to this resource
•	

a declaration addressing the trade-related
aspects of MSME access to finance and
cross-border payments.

Increasing the availability of online trade
information is an important objective.
Funding from the UK Trade and Investment
Advocacy Fund, financed by the UK Foreign,
Commonwealth and Development Office, was
secured for a proposed MSME web platform
to link to useful trade tools for MSMEs and
policymakers. The platform, called
Trade4MSMEs, entered the initial stages
of development at the end of the year. It is
expected to be completed in 2021. In
addition, the WTO Secretariat issued a
public webpage dedicated to MSMEs
as well as a database of MSME-related
provisions in regional trade agreements.
The group convened several webinars on
MSMEs to inform discussions and to mark
the fourth annual United Nations’ MSME Day.
Topics included cross-border payments,
MSMEs and paperless trade, and supporting
small business resilience through digital
tools. MSME Day 2020 events included
two webinars dedicated to presentations on
“Helping MSMEs in the time of COVID-19”.
Understanding the needs of the private sector
and small business traders is an important
element of the group’s work. The group met
representatives of MSMEs, Chambers of
Commerce and other MSME representative
organizations at the end of the year to inform
them of the recently endorsed MSME package
and to gather inputs for future work. To keep
the business community updated on the
group’s efforts, the coordinator issued three
newsletters, with updates on the group’s
work and its response to the pandemic.

Domestic regulation
of trade in services

	The Chair of negotiations under the
Joint Initiative on Services Domestic
Regulation circulated a “far advanced”
negotiating text in December.
	WTO members aim to finalize
negotiations by the 12th Ministerial
Conference scheduled for late 2021.

T

he Chair of negotiations on services
domestic regulation, Jaime Coghi
Arias (Costa Rica), circulated a “far
advanced” negotiating text on 18 December
capturing progress made in 2020 on
domestic regulation disciplines. Next year
will be “crucial” for the talks, he stressed,
given the commitment of “all participants to
deliver a significant outcome” at the 12th
WTO Ministerial Conference, scheduled
for late 2021.
The Chair said that the revised text reflects
the resolution of remaining drafting issues
although a small number of brackets remain
where agreement still needs to be reached.
Further discussions will be needed before
the group can conclude its work.
The disciplines apply to licensing and
qualification requirements as well as
procedures and technical standards for
trade in services. The objective is to create
good regulatory practices that help mitigate
any unintended trade-restrictive effects
of procedures for authorizing the supply
of services.
The joint initiative was launched by 57 trade
ministers at the 11th Ministerial Conference in
Buenos Aires in December 2017. The work is
organized outside the WTO Working Party on
Domestic Regulation, which is mandated to
develop any necessary disciplines to ensure

that members’ domestic regulations do not
constitute unnecessary barriers to trade in
services. Participation in the meetings of the
initiative is open to all WTO members and
observer governments.
Participants are in the process of submitting
indicative draft schedules outlining how
the disciplines will be incorporated in
their respective commitments under the
General Agreement on Trade in Services
(GATS). A total of 30 draft schedules
(representing 57 WTO members) had been
submitted as of end-2020. The additional
regulatory disciplines would be binding on all
participants, who would apply the improved
disciplines to services exporters from all
WTO members.

Sixty-three WTO
members are
participating in the
negotiations on
domestic regulation
of services.

At a meeting on 10 December, participants
agreed to clarify in the negotiating text that
the disciplines build upon the GATS and do
not diminish any obligations contained in
that agreement.
In 2020, participation in the initiative grew to 63
members with the incorporation of Thailand, the
first member of the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations to join. Participating members
— both developing and developed countries —
account for 73 per cent of world services trade.

Trade and environment initiatives
	A group of WTO members began
“structured discussions” on trade and
environmental sustainability to work
on possible “actions and deliverables”
in this area.
	Another group launched an “informal
dialogue” to explore how trade could
support domestic and global efforts
to tackle plastics pollution.

Among possible subjects for discussion
are improving transparency, monitoring
trade trends, promoting best practices,
strengthening policy coherence, identifying
scope for collective approaches, assessing
capacity and technical assistance needs and
cooperating with other international efforts.
Participants plan to work towards a concrete
outcome for the 12th Ministerial Conference
(MC12) scheduled for late 2021.
“This is a good moment to deepen our dialogue
on the role of trade to address pressing global

United Kingdom currently participate in the
informal dialogue.
Trade and environmental sustainability

Plastics pollution and environmentally
sustainable plastics trade

Participants in an “informal dialogue” on
plastics pollution and environmentally
sustainable plastics trade held their first
meeting in November. The dialogue, open
to all members, aims to complement and
enhance existing discussions within the
Committee on Trade and Environment and
other fora on plastics pollution. The initiative
was borne out of the recognition of the need
for coordinated global action on the rising
environmental, health and economic costs of
plastics pollution and the importance of trade
to any solution.
The dialogue will explore how improved trade
cooperation, within the rules and mechanisms
of the WTO, could contribute to domestic,
regional and global efforts to reduce plastics
pollution and the transition to a more
circular (see page 117) and environmentally
sustainable global plastics economy.

Another group of 53 members began
“structured discussions” on trade and
environmental sustainability. Stephen de Boer
(Canada) and Gloria Abraham Peralta (Costa
Rica) jointly coordinate the initiative. The
discussions seek to identify areas of common
interest and work towards concrete outcomes
on trade and sustainability.
The discussions will include promoting
transparency and information-sharing,

WTO, supporting technical assistance and
capacity-building needs, particularly for
least-developed countries, and working on
“deliverables” of environmental sustainability
in the various areas of the WTO. The
participants intend to report to ministers

Topics could include trade and climate
change, the circular economy and fossil
fuel subsidies (see page 119). The group
meetings will be open to all WTO
members. The initiative aims to complement
and enhance discussions within the
Committee on Trade and Environment and
other WTO bodies and to work alongside
relevant international organizations, the
business community, civil society and
academic institutions.
“Climate change and other major
environmental crises are not problems
that can be solved by governments alone.

to intensify efforts to increase women’s
participation in trade.
	The group published a report in
December with best practices and
recommendations on trade and gender.

T

he Informal Working Group on
Trade and Gender was launched in
September 2020 to intensify efforts
to increase women’s participation in global
commerce. It is the next phase of an initiative,
the Joint Declaration on Trade and Women’s
Economic Empowerment, launched at the
11th Ministerial Conference in Buenos Aires
in 2017. “Today marks an important new
phase in moving this work forward on a
continued transparent, collaborative and open
basis,” said Deputy Director-General Yonov
Frederick Agah.
The working group, which is open to all WTO
members and observers, was established
following requests from WTO members for
a more transparent and structured process
to deliver concrete elements for further
consideration in time for the 12th Ministerial
Conference scheduled for late 2021. The
Buenos Aires declaration, initially supported
by 118 WTO members and observers, counts
127 proponents, who constitute the current
membership of the working group.
The working group met on 10 December
2020 for the first time. It will focus on four key

General Council
	The process for selecting a new
Director-General began in May 2020 and
culminated in the selection by consensus
of Dr Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala of Nigeria in
February 2021. She is the first African
and first woman to head the WTO.
	The General Council was a prime
forum in 2020 for WTO members to
share information and views on trade
measures related to COVID-19. A
number of statements on questions
related to the pandemic were made
during the year.

originally scheduled for Kazakhstan
in June 2020, was postponed due to
the pandemic. On 1 March 2021, the
General Council agreed that MC12

November 2021 in Geneva.
	Members held extensive discussions
on the Work Programme on Electronic

Background
The General Council is entrusted
with carrying out the functions
of the WTO and taking actions
necessary to this effect between
Ministerial Conferences in
addition to carrying out the
specific tasks assigned to it
by the Agreement Establishing
the WTO. As part of its overall
oversight function, the General
Council conducts a year-end
review of WTO activities on the
basis of annual reports from its
subsidiary bodies.

COVID-19 trade-related matters

Amid the global pandemic, the General
Council provided a prime forum for WTO
members to share information and exchange
views on COVID-19 trade-related measures.
In May 2020, a special General Council
meeting was convened in virtual format to
discuss the trade-policy aspects and effects
of the global crisis, with 62 WTO members
and three WTO observers sharing their
experiences and views. This was the WTO’s
first formal virtual meeting and paved the
way for the organization to continue working
through virtual means when physical meetings
were not possible.
Throughout the year, matters related to
COVID-19 were at the centre of discussions.
WTO members presented several
communications and statements. These
included a joint ministerial statement by
Australia, Canada, the Republic of Korea, New
Zealand and Singapore on sustaining global
value chains, facilitating the movement of
people and minimizing the pandemic’s impact
on trade and investment. The Cairns Group of
farm goods exporters called for the protection
of global food security through open trade.

Council Chair David Walker led the selection
process for a new Director-General (see

the choice came down to two candidates –
Dr Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala of Nigeria and Yoo
Myung-hee of the Republic of Korea.

A group of 13 WTO
members proposed
the creation of
a Trade and
Health Initiative.

Dr Okonjo-Iweala
was appointed as
the WTO’s 7th
Director-General
in February 2021.

A group of 13 developing and developed
country members proposed the creation of
a WTO Trade and Health Initiative. As a first
step, they urged all members to back a joint
declaration on enhancing the capacity of the
trading system to deal with COVID-19 and any
future pandemic (see page 41).
Bangladesh drew attention to the plight of the
garments and textile sector while Afghanistan
called for action to support fragile and conflictaffected countries. Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) ministers responsible for
trade urged members to adopt digital solutions
to strengthen supply chain resilience.
At the December meeting, members held
an exchange on a status report by the Chair
of the Council for Trade-Related Aspects
of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) on
the consideration by the TRIPS Council of a
proposal for a waiver from certain provisions
of the TRIPS Agreement for the prevention,
containment and treatment of COVID-19
(see page 113).

For several months, the General Council was
unable to reach a consensus. But on 5 February
2021, Ms Yoo withdrew her candidacy and Dr
Okonjo-Iweala was appointed as the WTO’s
seventh Director-General on 15 February. “This
is a very significant moment for the WTO. On
behalf of the General Council, I extend our
warmest congratulations to Dr Ngozi OkonjoIweala on her appointment,” Ambassador
Walker said. She is the first woman and the first
African to lead the WTO.
Current trade debates

WTO members continued to discuss issues
such as the negotiating function of the WTO,
development – inclusivity and special and
differential treatment for developing countries,
the importance of market-oriented conditions
to the world trading system, transparency and
the deliberative function of the WTO, including
strengthening the role of WTO committees.
In December, an extensive debate took
place on a draft decision, co-sponsored
by more than 80 members, on agriculture
export prohibitions relating to the World
Food Programme (see page 47). Other
draft decisions presented for consideration
included an action plan to enhance support
for cotton by-product development in least
developed countries (LDCs – see page 148).
Twelfth WTO Ministerial
Conference (MC12)

Originally scheduled for June 2020 in NurSultan, Kazakhstan, MC12 was postponed
due to the pandemic. Kazakhstan offered
to host the conference in June 2021.
However, due to the uncertainties caused
by the pandemic and the current situation,

members decided that Geneva would be a
more realistic option. On 1 March 2021, the
General Council agreed that MC12 would
take place in the week of 29 November 2021
in Geneva.
Implementation of Bali, Nairobi and
Buenos Aires outcomes

The General Council regularly reviewed
progress in the implementation of decisions
taken by ministers at the 9th, 10th and
11th Ministerial Conferences. The reviews
included: progress in the implementation of
the Nairobi decision on export subsidies in
agriculture (see page 84); the Bali decision
on tariff rate quotas; LDC preferential rules
of origin and the LDC services waiver (see
pages 99 and 111); implementation of the
Trade Facilitation Agreement (see page 109);
and Aid for Trade (see page 151).
Work Programme on
Electronic Commerce

Secretariat organized a webinar on quantifying
the moratorium and its impact on
economic development.
Members’ views continued to differ, with
some calling for a permanent moratorium
to give predictability to e-commerce, some
calling for it to be lifted to allow members
policy space, and others arguing for a
continuation of the current periodic renewals.
At the October meeting, India highlighted
the importance of continuing discussions on
the Work Programme and the moratorium
and suggested having a standing item on
the Council agenda. In December, members
considered a joint submission by India and
South Africa highlighting the need for a
multilateral discussion to promote an inclusive
and development-oriented approach to
electronic commerce.
The joint submission suggested that the Work
Programme be a standing item not only in
the General Council but also in the relevant

At the General Council
on 31 July 2020, it was

Members agreed in December 2019 to
reinvigorate the Work Programme on
Electronic Commerce, including with
structured discussions based on all topics
of interest brought forward by members.
Members also agreed to extend the
moratorium on customs duties on electronic
transmissions until MC12. Early in 2020,
the Chair of the General Council held
consultations and convened an informal
meeting to hear members’ views on how to
structure the work.
In July 2020, an informal meeting was held
to look at two submissions. One was from
India and South Africa, and the other from a
group of 13 delegations: Australia; Canada;
Chile; Colombia; Hong Kong, China; Iceland;
the Republic of Korea; New Zealand;
Norway; Singapore; Switzerland; Thailand;
and Uruguay. The submissions presented
different views and perspectives on the scope
and impact of the moratorium on customs

It also reviewed the following multi-year waivers:

WTO bodies. It further proposed that the
General Council should play a central role
in the discussions and keep the programme

At that same December meeting, the General
Council also heard the reports from the
chairs of the Council for Trade in Services,
the Council for Trade in Goods and the
TRIPS Council, where issues under the Work
Programme were also discussed.
Requests for accession and

Trade
in goods
	Thirteen new trade concerns were
raised in the Council for Trade in
Goods, up from 12 in 2019.
	Several WTO members proposed
that the Council discuss in a
systemic manner trade-related
measures taken over COVID-19.
	A proposal was made for an
authoritative interpretation of the
Enabling Clause to provide greater
legal certainty to non-reciprocal
preferences granted by developing
countries to least-developed
countries (LDCs).

Background
The Council for Trade
in Goods is responsible
for the workings of WTO
agreements on trade in
goods. It consists of the
full WTO membership
and reports to the WTO
General Council. The Goods
Council has 12 subsidiary
committees dealing with
specific subjects, such
as agriculture, market
access, subsidies,
technical barriers to trade,
sanitary and phytosanitary
measures, import licensing,
customs valuation and
trade facilitation. These
committees also comprise
all WTO members.
Working parties on state
trading enterprises and the
Information Technology
Agreement also report to
the Goods Council.

Among the new issues brought before the
Council, Russia – supported by Armenia,
China, Kazakhstan and the Kyrgyz
Republic – expressed concerns regarding
the European Union’s proposed carbon
border adjustment mechanism. Under the
mechanism, the European Union will impose a
levy corresponding to the carbon footprint of
an import from outside the European Union.
Members expressed concerns as to whether
the proposed measure would be consistent
with WTO rules against discrimination.
Australia expressed concerns over measures
implemented by China on a range of goods
imported from Australia, including live rock
lobster, barley, wine, timber logs, cotton
and other agricultural commodities. Turkey
expressed concerns over the Kingdom of
Saudi Arabia’s trade policies, including
what it said were long delays in customs
clearance and increased safety inspections
applied to perishable goods. Hong Kong,
China expressed concerns over a revised US
requirement that goods produced in Hong
Kong, China could no longer indicate “Hong
Kong” as their origin but had to indicate
“China” instead.
In addition to previous concerns regarding the
European Union’s renegotiation of tariff rate
quota (TRQ) commitments as a consequence
of the United Kingdom leaving the European
Union (Brexit), nine members expressed new
concerns regarding the TRQ commitments of
the United Kingdom following Brexit.

European Union’s renewable energy directive;
and Russia’s trade-restricting practices.
COVID-19 and measures relating
to trade in goods

Nine WTO members proposed that the
Council provide a platform for members to
discuss, in a systemic manner, the traderelated measures adopted in the context
of the COVID-19 pandemic. Issues would
include the expiry date and notification of
measures, the list of products, an indication
of trade-facilitating measures, good practices
in monitoring those measures in the Council’s
subsidiary bodies and collaboration with other
international organizations.

Authoritative interpretation of the
Enabling Clause

The Republic of Korea introduced a
proposal for an authoritative interpretation
of the Enabling Clause, which allows for
preferential trade arrangements between
developed and developing countries and
among developing countries. The aim is
to provide greater legal certainty to nonreciprocal preferences granted by
developing countries to LDCs.
Transparency

Proponents introduced a revised proposal
on transparency to enhance members’
compliance with notification requirements,
adding flexibilities and clarifications
with respect to the previous revision.
In particular, LDCs would no longer be
covered by proposed administrative sanctions
if they requested technical assistance to
address challenges in submitting notifications
in a timely manner.
Some members reiterated their opposition
to administrative measures and the differential
treatment of notifications on agriculture.
Other delegations referred to the need for
an inclusive approach that considers the
challenges faced by developing and leastdeveloped countries.

SPOTLIGHT

COVID-19 and world trade
Global trade in goods and services was severely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic that
erupted in early 2020 and the adoption of global health measures taken by WTO members
to try and mitigate the crisis.

T
335

measures

076

rade in goods declined by 5.3
per cent in 2020 (see also page
73). Trade in services also
declined as limits to travel and other
health-related restrictions prevented or
severely curtailed face-to-face service
delivery activities. Travel and transport
services declined by 63 per cent and
19 per cent respectively.
Most of the 335 COVID-19 trade
and trade-related measures identified
in WTO trade monitoring reports
were adopted on a temporary basis.
In the early stages of the pandemic,
most of the measures taken by
WTO members restricted trade.
But by mid-October, 195 (58 per
cent) of the measures were tradefacilitating compared with 140 (42
per cent) that could be considered
trade-restrictive.

Around 39 per cent of the restrictive
measures implemented in response
to the pandemic had been repealed
by mid-October. Some 18 per
cent of trade-facilitating measures
related to COVID-19 had also been
eliminated. The trade coverage of
pandemic-related trade-facilitating
measures implemented since the
beginning of the pandemic was
estimated at US$ 227 billion while
trade-restrictive measures stood at
US$ 180 billion.
To help respond to trade issues
arising from the global health crisis,
the WTO established an internal,
cross-cutting working group.
This was directed to help ensure
comprehensive monitoring of
COVID-19-related trade measures
touching on WTO work.

The first paper produced by the group
was on “Trade in Medical Goods in
the Context of Tackling COVID-19”.
It was published in April and updated
in December (see box).

Travel and
transport services
were particularly
hard hit.
These ranged from sanitary and
phytosanitary (SPS) measures and
technical barrier to trade (TBT)
regulations to intellectual property
measures. The group produced 20
information notes on the impact of
COVID-19 on world trade, provided
regular trade data updates and closely
monitored members’ trade-related
policy developments. It focused on
ensuring transparency around trade
and trade policy developments while
providing substantive information on
trade issues relevant for policymakers
and businesses as they attempted to
navigate the rapidly evolving global
trading environment.

A N N U A L R E P O R T 2 0 21

Other topics covered by group
notes included transparency
and why it matters at times of
crisis, trade in services, trade
costs, agriculture, what measures
WTO members used to expedite
access to COVID-19 medical
goods and services, and traderelated issues concerned with
vaccine distribution.
As of November 2020, there had
been over 270,000 downloads of
the group’s reports.
The WTO also created a dedicated
section on its website to provide
up-to-the-minute information on
COVID-19 and world trade,
including relevant notifications by
WTO members, the impact of the
virus on exports and imports, and
how WTO activities have responded
to the pandemic.

The General Council spent much
time discussing COVID-19. It held
a special virtual meeting in May for
WTO members to share information
and views on COVID-19 trade-related
matters. It was the first time that a
special General Council meeting had
been convened to discuss the tradepolicy aspects and effects of a global
crisis (see page 68). The Council
continued to address the issue in
subsequent meetings.
Trade and health

COVID-19 has placed health systems
worldwide under extraordinary
pressure. In the early phase of the
pandemic, many countries faced
a shortage in essential personal
protective equipment (PPE). As
production increased to meet the
unparalleled spike in demand, trade
played an important role in getting
supplies to those most in need.
In the first half of 2020, imports of
face protection products jumped
by 90 per cent while trade in medical
goods increased by 16 per cent
(see box).

As the pandemic took hold, WTO
members shared information with the
WTO about their trade-restrictive and
trade-facilitating measures.

Trade in medical goods

	 Imports of face masks jumped
80.9% in 2020 to reach
US$ 141.4 billion.
	Imports and exports of medical
goods increased by 16 per cent in
2020, reaching US$ 2,343 billion
– at the same time as total world
merchandise trade declined by
7.6% in value.
	The world’s average tariff applied
on textile face masks is 14.3%.
	Export restrictions on personal
protective equipment, such as
gloves and masks, drugs and
medicine taken in the early stages
of the pandemic were gradually
phased out.
	Many countries took measures to
exempt imports from tariffs and to
streamline customs and
other procedures.

– “Trade in Medical Goods in the Context of
Tackling COVID-19”.

Duties, taxes and charges on COVID19-critical medical goods and other
essential supplies were temporarily
removed or deferred by 40 WTO
members. These trade-facilitating
actions helped reduce the cost of the
goods needed to fight the pandemic,
both for the health sector and for the
public. Measures to reduce or eliminate
import tariffs made up around two-thirds
of the import trade-facilitating measures
reported to the WTO.
In addition, members expedited
customs procedures and border
clearance for COVID-19-critical
medical goods by cutting back
red tape. Actions taken included
establishing priority clearance
channels, lessening and simplifying
documentary requirements and
electronic processing, and improving
border agency cooperation.
Members also took steps to enhance
regulatory approval and cooperation
on standards for traded goods,
including measures to expedite
regulatory assessments, recognizing
the results of foreign regulators,

conformity assessment procedures.
Many members improved access to
COVID-19-critical medical services.
The international movement of health
workers was facilitated, together with
new rules on telemedicine.
Export restrictions on PPE and medical
goods taken by some countries in the
early stages of the pandemic were
gradually phased out as supplies

became more readily available. However,
certain measures remain in place.
More information on members’
responses to the crisis is available
in the information note “How WTO
members have used trade measures

and on the WTO’s dedicated webpage
on COVID-19 and world trade.
Vaccine production
and distribution

Successive waves of coronavirus
infection led to increased efforts to
develop and manufacture vaccines
and diagnostics to combat the
pandemic, with the aim of meeting
national needs and providing equitable
access worldwide. However, demand
far exceeded supply, leading to export
limitations in some countries as
producers struggled to fulfil orders.
Vaccine production is supported by
complex value chains for raw materials
and components. A typical vaccine
manufacturing plant will use in the
region of 9,000 different materials
sourced from some 300 suppliers
across approximately 30 different
countries, according to an estimate
from the International Federation
of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers
and Associations.
WTO trade statistics suggest
that global exports of some
particularly critical raw materials
for vaccine production (including
nucleic acids, amino acid phenols,
acyclic amides, lecithins and sterols)
grew by 49 per cent in the first six
months of 2020 to reach some US$
15.5 billion in value.

but this decline was reduced to
2 per cent by the fourth quarter.
Iron and steel trade is indicative of
broader economic conditions as these
products are heavily used in both
automobile manufacturing and building
construction, both of which were hit
hard by the pandemic.
Strong growth in textiles trade in
both the third and fourth quarter
partly reflected high demand for
medical face coverings. Electronic
goods including computers also saw
steady growth of 12 per cent in the
second half of 2020, reflecting strong
demand for upgraded equipment to
facilitate working remotely.
In view of the complexity of raw material
and component value chains and
limited production capacity in many
countries, export controls, border
clearance and transit issues affecting
the sourcing of imported raw materials
and other essential components posed
difficulties for scaling up vaccine
manufacturing operations and ensuring
equitable access.

and Health Initiative. As a first step,
they urged all members to back a joint
declaration on enhancing the capacity
of the trading system to deal with
COVID-19 and any future pandemic
(see page 69).

At the WTO, members discussed a
proposal, initially submitted in October
2020, for a waiver of certain provisions
of the Agreement on Trade-Related
Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights
(TRIPS) in relation to the “prevention,
containment or treatment” of COVID-19.
According to the proponents, the
objective is to avoid barriers to timely
access to affordable medical products
including vaccines and medicines or to
scaling-up of research, development,
manufacturing and supply of essential
medical products (see page 113).

Impact of COVID-19 on world trade

In November 2020, a group of
developing and developed countries
proposed the creation of a WTO Trade

A N N U A L R E P O R T 2 0 21

Discussions have continued in 2021
in response to revised proposals
submitted by WTO members.

Global merchandise trade volumes
declined by 14.3 per cent in the
second quarter of 2020 compared
to the previous period as COVID-19
containment measures affected
economies around the world. This
contraction is sharper than the 10.2 per
cent drop recorded during the financial
crisis between the third quarter of 2008
and first quarter of 2009.
However, most categories of
manufactured goods saw significant
gains in the second half of 2020.
World trade in iron and steel was
down 17 per cent in the third quarter

Travel and transport services, down 63
per cent and 19 per cent respectively
in 2020, were directly impacted by
containment measures designed to
limit the spread of COVID-19, many
of which remain in place or have
been tightened in response to the
resurgence of the disease.
The number of daily international flights
fell around 80 per cent in the first
quarter of 2020 as countries closed
their borders to reduce the spread
of COVID-19. This number gradually
picked up as cases declined and
people resumed limited travel. The end
of 2020 saw an uptick in flights as
people travelled to meet friends and
family for seasonal holidays, but a
resurgence of the virus has reduced
flights again in 2021.
WTO economists estimate the
volume of world merchandise
trade will increase by 8.0 per cent
in 2021. Travel services are not
expected to fully recover until the
pandemic wanes.

Market access
	The Committee discussed 19 trade
concerns, one more than in 2019.
	The WTO launched a new
goods schedules e-library,
facilitating access to all legal
instruments recording tariff
and other commitments made
by WTO members.

Trade concerns

WTO members raised 19 trade concerns on
issues such as border delays, applied tariffs
allegedly in excess of WTO commitments,
procedures to modify schedules of
concessions, discriminatory internal taxation
and, in particular, prohibitions and restrictions
on imports and exports. Many concerns had
been raised previously but a number were new.

	A record 35 members submitted
notifications on quantitative
restrictions, up from 14 in 2019.
Many of these notifications referred
to export restrictions on products
essential to combating COVID-19.
Several members also notified
when the restrictions were
subsequently lifted.

Russia submitted a proposal on enhancing
transparency on applied tariffs. Australia,
Brazil and Canada submitted a proposal on
transparency in tariff rate changes and their
impact on shipments en route. Colombia
and other members called for enhancing
transparency of trade-restricting measures
adopted in response to COVID-19. The
Committee requested the WTO Secretariat to
provide additional information on the COVID19-related measures notified.

Background
The Committee on Market
Access supervises the
implementation of tariff
and non-tariff measures
not covered by any other
WTO body. In addition, it
seeks to ensure that WTO
members’ schedules of
concessions are up to date,
including changes required
to reflect amendments to
the Harmonized System
(HS). The HS allows
countries to classify traded
goods on a common basis.
Without this technical work
at the Committee, it would
be difficult to compare
members’ tariff obligations
with the tariffs they apply
in practice.

COVID-19

WTO members commended efforts by the
Secretariat to monitor governments’ traderelated measures during the COVID-19 crisis
(see page 76). They discussed ways to ensure
that the emergency measures introduced to
restrict exports are lifted once they are no
longer deemed necessary and asked the
Secretariat to produce a more detailed report.

The WTO Secretariat presented a
consolidated list of products covered by a
plurilateral agreement on pharmaceuticals,
known as the Pharma Agreement. The
European Union said the participation of
signatory parties in global pharmaceutical trade
had fallen from over 90 per cent in 1994 to only

depriving many of life-saving medicines, the EU
invited WTO members to rethink the relevance
of maintaining tariffs on such products.
Databases

In 2020, the Secretariat launched a goods
schedules e-library (https://goods-schedules.
wto.org), an online platform with access
to thousands of files and legal instruments
recording tariff and other commitments made
by WTO members, known as their schedules
of concessions. The platform also shows the
various changes that have taken place, such
as renegotiated schedules, transpositions
of schedules, sectoral initiatives and other
rectifications and modifications.
The WTO’s Integrated Database, the main
source of tariff and import data, began
automatic data transmission with interested
members. This procedure significantly
simplifies data notification both for members
and the Secretariat.
The Secretariat presented a revised version
of the quantitative restrictions database,
which transforms notifications into a machinereadable format and makes it easy to search
and display data. It is expected that this revised
system will be released to the public in 2021.

progress on the HS2012 transposition, with
the schedules of 99 members updated. In
addition, 54 schedules were transposed to
HS2017 in 2020, of which 18 were certified.
The Committee was informed by the WCO
that a new amendment will enter into force
on 1 January 2022.
Together with the WCO Secretariat, the
Committee organized a workshop on the
Harmonized System, including sessions on
its practical application, its role in the WTO
and on the new amendments that will enter
into force on 1 January 2022.
Quantitative restrictions

The Committee received quantitative
restrictions notifications from a record
35 members, up from 14 in 2019. These
notifications include information on
prohibitions and other restrictions that
do not take the form of a tariff, tax, fee or
charge, and are allowed by the WTO in
specific circumstances only. Many related
to temporary export restrictions introduced
by WTO members to fight the COVID-19
pandemic. The number of these temporary
measures peaked in the second quarter of
2020 and many have since been phased out.

more market oriented.
The rules and commitments
apply to market access,
domestic support and
export competition as well
as export restrictions and
prohibitions. The Committee
on Agriculture oversees
the implementation of the
Agreement. The Committee
also monitors follow-up to

In March 2020, as the COVID-19 crisis
deepened, the heads of the WTO, the UN

June 2020 on COVID-19 and agricultural
trade policies. Members agreed to include
“COVID-19 and agriculture” as a standing
item on the Committee’s agenda. It was
also agreed to invite observer international
organizations to contribute to the discussions.
Several written contributions were submitted
by members on COVID-19 and agriculture,
including specific notifications and ad hoc
reports on measures taken in the agricultural
sector in response to the pandemic. Some
observer international organizations also
circulated contributions on this theme.
Several members called for enhanced
transparency on COVID-19 measures at a
Committee meeting in July. In a subsequent
information session dedicated to COVID-19,
members also heard from several international
organizations about their research work.
In August, the WTO Secretariat published
an information note on the impact of the

The WTO Secretariat continued its work on the
improvement of its online tools, including the
new online system for submission of agriculture

The Secretariat added new features to
the question and answers function of the
Agriculture Information Management System
(AG-IMS), which allows members to pose
questions and provide answers to be
discussed at Committee meetings.
Outreach and information exchange

The WTO Secretariat organized a 2020
edition of the WTO Agriculture Symposium,
in virtual mode, exploring the role of
international trade in agriculture in food
system transformation. The symposium
marked 25 years of the Agreement on
Agriculture. It assessed and drew lessons
from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic
on agricultural trade.
“The lessons from the pandemic for
global foods systems are clear. The
continued strengthening of the WTO

of virtual outreach conducted by the
Agriculture and Commodities Division
designed to explore topical issues in food
and agricultural trade.

rights and obligations of
WTO members regarding
measures taken to ensure
food safety, protect human
health from plant or animalspread diseases, protect
plant and animal health
from pests and diseases,
or prevent other damage
from pests. Governments
must ensure that their SPS
measures are necessary for
health protection and based
on scientific principles.

The SPS Committee commenced
implementing several recommendations in
the report. A Working Group on Approval
Procedures was established to enhance
implementation of approval procedures that
facilitate trade while meeting an importer’s
appropriate level of SPS protection. This
working group, led by Canada and Paraguay,
held its first meeting in November.

previously raised concerns.
Following an exercise conducted by the
WTO Secretariat in September on the status
of certain specific trade concerns, members
reported 35 resolved and 42 as partially

Notifications

The SPS Agreement requires notification of
draft regulations that are not “substantially the
same” as an international standard. In 2020,
members notified 2,122 new or changed SPS
regulations, an all-time high, and up from 1,762

areas were the most common. But since
April 2020, most notifications and
communications relate to measures to
facilitate trade (see page 109). Some tradefacilitating examples include the acceptance
of electronic/scanned certificates and the
identification of dedicated websites to verify
the validity of, or to submit, certificates.
Capacity-building

Despite the challenges of organizing technical
assistance activities, due to the pandemic,
the WTO Secretariat held 12 SPS technical
assistance activities in virtual formats.
Publications

In 2020, the WTO Secretariat published
an information note, “Future resilience to
diseases of animal origin: the role of trade”,
noting that the impact of COVID-19 has
far eclipsed that of other recent outbreaks
of such diseases. This note maps out the
international framework in place to address
these issues along with efforts to ensure
safe trade in animals and animal products,
including wildlife. It is clear from the current
pandemic that international cooperation is
essential in global animal health and world
trade, the publication notes.

The note was part of a series on COVID-19
(see page 76). The Secretariat released
another on “Standards, regulations and

WTO members?”. Around two-thirds of
notifications by WTO members in response to
COVID-19 are related to product standards
and regulations, or procedures to assess
conformity with such measures (i.e. technical
barriers to trade and SPS measures).

Technical barriers to trade
	The Committee used new IT tools,
such as the eAgenda online platform, to
continue its work despite the restrictions
stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic.
	The Committee’s implementation
of its current 2019-21 workplan
continued, including on developing
guidelines on the choice and design
of appropriate and proportionate
conformity assessment procedures.
	The Committee held a number of thematic
sessions on various topics, including
mandatory marking and labelling, technical
assistance, conformity assessment and
good regulatory practices.
	The Committee adopted a timeline for
the completion in 2021 of the ninth
triennial review of the Technical Barriers
to Trade (TBT) Agreement, which will
lay down its 2022-24 workplan.
	Members’ TBT notifications and
specific trade concerns rose to
record levels, indicating increasing
use of the Committee’s transparency
and monitoring mechanisms.

Progress on several fronts

The TBT Committee continued implementing
its 2019-21 workplan, adopted in
November 2018. Alongside its regular
meetings, the Committee also held several
thematic sessions on various issues,
such as technical regulations (mandatory
marking and labelling), technical assistance,
conformity assessment procedures and
good regulatory practices. The Committee
also agreed on the timeline for the completion
of its ninth Triennial Review in 2021, which
will adopt its 2022-24 workplan.

Background
The Technical Barriers to Trade
(TBT) Agreement aims to ensure
that regulations, standards, testing
and certification procedures
followed by WTO members do not
create unnecessary obstacles to
trade. The number of regulations
adopted by WTO members has
continued to grow in response to
consumers’ demands for safe, highquality products, the protection of
health and the need to curb pollution
and environmental degradation.

090

The adoption of enhanced procedures
and its use of new IT tools, such as the
eAgenda online platform, allowed the
Committee to continue its work despite
disruptions caused by the COVID-19
pandemic. Members considered that the
eAgenda in particular greatly facilitated
discussing specific trade concerns
(STCs). Engagement in STCs increased,
including by LDCs.
The Committee’s work continued with respect
to its mandate for developing guidelines
on the choice and design of appropriate
and proportionate conformity assessment

procedures. Significant interest was expressed
on this issue, with submissions on draft
guidelines by the European Union, the United
States, Australia, Japan, Canada and China.

In 2020, the Committee discussed a record
214 STCs – new and previously raised
concerns regarding draft or adopted TBT
measures. This is a significant jump from the
already high number of STCs (185) discussed
in 2019 (see Figure 5). Compared with
2019, the number of new STCs (57) grew
by over 60 per cent, with a slight increase in
previously raised STCs (157).

At an informal meeting in December, WTO
members shared experiences and views
on TBT measures they have adopted, or
were planning to adopt, in response to the
COVID-19 pandemic. The WTO Secretariat
presented an information note, “Standards,
Regulations and COVID-19 – What Actions
Taken by WTO Members”. The Committee
also held a workshop on the role of gender in
the development of standards.

The new STCs covered a wide range
of product regulations, including those
dealing with cybersecurity, environmental
protection (on solid waste, plastics,
eco-design requirements, energy
conservation) and the description and
labelling of various products. Of the new
STCs, 33 were raised by developing
countries (21 independently and 12 in
conjunction with developed countries).

The ePing alert system for tracking TBT and
sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) notifications
– which was upgraded in 2020 to facilitate the
sharing of comments on notifications – had
12,360 registered users from 183 countries/
territories, up from 8,820 users in 2019.

number of notifying members decreased
from 93 to 82. The United States submitted
the most notifications. Africa was again
particularly active, with Uganda, Kenya,
Tanzania, Rwanda and Egypt among the top
ten notifying members.
Almost all notifications (93 per cent) were
submitted through the WTO’s online portal,
which enables the WTO Secretariat to publish
notifications within two days of receipt. The
portal also allows members to track the status
of submitted notifications and facilitates the
preparation of notifications via templates (see

TBT@40

The WTO Secretariat organized a TBT@40
dialogue series to mark 40 years of the TBT
Agreement, with three online events. The
first focused on how SPS/TBT transparency
mechanisms reduce trade tensions. The
second looked at how members use the TBT
Committee to raise and discuss STCs for
addressing trade frictions without having to
resort to formal WTO disputes.
The third looked at whether the Committee’s
“six principles” on international standardization
(transparency, openness, impartiality and
consensus, effectiveness and relevance,
coherence, and the development dimension)
remain fit for purpose 20 years after
their adoption.
Capacity-building

In 2020, demand for – and delivery of – TBT
technical assistance activities was severely
affected by the pandemic. As a result, many
such activities had to be postponed to 2021.
The WTO Secretariat was nonetheless
able to hold various TBT activities via virtual
workshops or seminars, including three

national workshops on the TBT Agreement (in
Paraguay, Peru and Zimbabwe) and
one national workshop on the TBT and
SPS Agreements (in Brazil). In addition,
training on the TBT and SPS Agreements
was provided as part of the first online
Regional Trade Policy Course for
Caribbean members.
As in previous years, there was strong
demand for training on TBT transparency
and on ePing in particular. Fifteen virtual
ePing training activities were organized,
including on how to submit and track
notifications related to COVID-19.

Subsidies and
countervailing measures

B

	The Committee reviewed WTO
members’ notifications of
subsidies, and countervailing
duty legislation and actions.

ecause of the COVID-19 pandemic,
the Subsidies and Countervailing
Measures (SCM) Committee held only
one regular and one special meeting in 2020,
in the autumn. The Committee reviewed WTO
members’ notifications of specific subsidies,
notifications of countervailing duty legislation,
semi-annual reports of countervailing actions
and ad hoc notifications of preliminary and
final countervailing measures taken.

	The Chair alerted WTO members
to the continuing “chronic” low
compliance with notification
obligations on subsidies.
	Initiations of countervailing duty
investigations rose to 27 in the
first half of 2020, compared with
15 in the same period of 2019.

The Chair of the Committee, Michèle Legault
Dooley (Canada), spoke of the “chronic”
low compliance with the fundamental
transparency obligation to notify subsidies,
saying it constitutes a serious problem
for the proper functioning of the SCM
Agreement. Numerous members underlined
the importance of transparency, citing poor
compliance with notification obligations.
Only 83 of the WTO’s 164 members had
submitted their 2019 subsidies notifications.
In addition, 67 members had not submitted
their 2017 notifications.

Background
The Subsidies and
Countervailing Measures
(SCM) Agreement regulates
WTO members’ use of
subsidies and countervailing
measures on subsidized
imports of a product found
to be injuring domestic
producers of that product.
The SCM Committee reviews
WTO members’ notifications
of specific subsidies,
notifications of countervailing
duty legislation, semi‑annual
reports of countervailing
actions and ad hoc
notifications of preliminary
and final countervailing
measures taken. It serves
as a forum for members to
discuss the implementation of
the SCM Agreement and any
matters arising from this.

Initiations of
countervailing duty
investigations rose to

27

in the first half of
2020, compared with

15

in the same
period of 2019.

A N N U A L R E P O R T 2 0 21

The Committee continued to discuss ways
to improve the timeliness and completeness
of notifications and other information flows
on trade measures. It also considered a
revised proposal by the United States
on procedures for questions and answers
on programmes not included in WTO
members’ notifications.
The Chair recalled the 31 December 2015
deadline for the extended transition given
to 19 developing countries to eliminate
export subsidies. The Chair noted that the
beneficiaries should have made their final
transparency notifications by 30 June 2016
but only 15 had done so. The Committee
agreed to continue to discuss this issue in
2021. Least-developed countries and ten
of the developing members listed in Annex
VII(b) of the SCM Agreement continue to be
exempted from the export subsidy prohibition.

093

-----------------------Page 95 End-----------------------

The Committee also reviewed notifications
of countervailing actions taken (see Figure
7). The number of initiations of countervailing
duty investigations increased to 27 in the first
half of 2020, compared with 15 in the same
period of 2019. As of 30 June 2020, there
were 228 notified measures (definitive duties
and undertakings) in force.
The issue “subsidies and overcapacity” was
discussed in the Committee for the eighth
time at the request of Canada, the European
Union, Japan, Norway and the United States.
Members continued their discussions on
whether subsidies contribute to overcapacity
in certain sectors.

Background
WTO members can apply
anti-dumping measures on
imports of a product where
the exporting company
exports the product at a price
lower than its normal value,
generally the price it charges
in its home market, and
the dumped imports cause
or threaten to cause injury
to the domestic industry.
The Committee on AntiDumping Practices provides
WTO members with the
opportunity to discuss any
matters relating to the AntiDumping Agreement.

Rules of origin
	WTO members marked the 25th
anniversary of the Agreement on Rules
of Origin with an event in March 2020.
	The Committee continued its consideration
of a proposal to enhance transparency in
non-preferential rules of origin.
	Members discussed preferential rules
of origin for least-developed countries
(LDCs) and considered notes by the WTO
Secretariat on the underutilization of
trade preferences.

Background
Rules of origin are the
criteria used to determine
the country in which a
product is made. They are
used in the implementation
of many trade measures,
including trade preferences,
customs duties, labelling
of country of origin and the
application of anti-dumping
measures. The main
objective of the Agreement
on Rules of Origin is to
harmonize the rules that
all WTO members use to
determine origin in their
non-preferential trade. This
work is conducted by the
Committee on Rules of
Origin. The Committee also
reviews the implementation
of the 2013 and 2015
ministerial decisions on
preferential rules of origin
for LDCs.

098

T

he Agreement on Rules of Origin
marked its 25th anniversary in March
2020 with an event bringing together
WTO members, the Secretariat, former
chairs of the Committee on Rules of Origin
and private sector representatives.
Rules of origin are used to define where
a product is made; they are critical in
determining what the import conditions,
such as tariffs, quotas or anti-dumping
duties, should be. But work is unfinished on
harmonizing non-preferential rules of origin
– those applying to trade on a most-favourednation (MFN) basis.
The Chair of the Committee, Uma Shankari
Muniandy (Singapore), said that rules of origin
have become increasingly important — and
complicated. “Regional and global value
chains fragmented the production of goods
and made the determination of origin a more
complex exercise,” she noted.
Non-preferential rules of origin

WTO members continued considering
a proposal to streamline notifications of
non-preferential rules of origin, used for the
implementation of trade policy measures such
as quotas, anti-dumping or “made in” labels.

A N N U A L R E P O R T 2 0 21

-----------------------Page 100 End-----------------------

Rules of origin are
particularly important
in the production
of complex, hightechnology products,
such as mobile phones.

The proposal aims at updating the information
held by the WTO Secretariat, standardizing
the way the information is notified (by using
a template) and enhancing the role of the
Committee in examining such notifications.
Despite widening support, some developing
countries expressed concerns that the
proposal would increase their administrative
burden by adding new notification obligations.
No discussions were held on the work
programme for the harmonization of nonpreferential rules of origin.
Preferential rules of origin

WTO ministers have laid down guidelines
to make it easier for LDCs to qualify for
preferential treatment and better utilize market
access opportunities. Members continued to
discuss ways to ensure that preferential rules of
origin for LDCs are “transparent and simple”.
In 2020, WTO members initiated an examination
of preference-granting members’ rules of
origin based on the ad valorem percentage
criterion, whereby the degree of manufacturing
or processing carried out in a country is
calculated by the value it adds to the product
or products. They also heard updates about
new developments regarding the preferential

A N N U A L R E P O R T 2 0 21

rules of origin of the European Union,
Russia, Thailand and the United Kingdom.
The Committee continued examining the
link between origin requirements and the
underutilization of preferences by LDCs.
The Secretariat prepared a note on the
minerals and metals sector that found that
underutilization was surprisingly high, with
only about a third of all preference-eligible
imports receiving a tariff preference.
Another note examined requirements for
direct consignment – whether goods are
shipped directly or transhipped. It found that
consignment requirements seem to affect
LDC utilization of preferences: for instance,
52 per cent of all imports from landlocked
LDCs do not receive any preferential
treatment, more than double the 21 per cent
for LDCs with sea access.

Import licensing

T

	The Committee reviewed 197
notifications from WTO members
under the Agreement on Import
Licensing Procedures, a sharp
increase from 43 in 2019.
	In October, the Committee launched
an import licensing website, which
can be publicly accessed.
	The Committee heard specific
trade concerns about import
licensing rules and procedures.

Background
The Agreement on Import
Licensing Procedures
establishes disciplines on
import licensing systems,
with the objective of
ensuring that the procedures
applied for granting
import licences do not in
themselves restrict trade.
It aims to simplify the
administrative requirements
necessary to obtain licences
and to ensure fair and
transparent administration
of the procedures. The
Agreement requires
WTO members to notify
publications and legislation
on import licensing

he Committee received 173
notifications from 12 members on
new import licensing procedures
or changes in these procedures. It also
reviewed 24 notifications from 22 members
regarding responses to a questionnaire on
import licensing procedures. No notifications
were received regarding publications and/
or legislation on import licensing procedures,
compared with two in 2019.
Notifications on new import licensing
procedures or changes increased almost
nine-fold compared with 2019. The increase
could be attributed, among other things,
to the introduction of a new format for
notifications and technical assistance
activities conducted in some WTO members.
In contrast, the absence of notifications
on publications and/or legislation could be
attributed to the fact that these can now be
incorporated into notifications on new or
changed licensing procedures.
As of the end of 2020, 14 WTO members
had not submitted any notification on import
licensing. In addition, 23 members had
never submitted responses to the annual
questionnaire on licensing procedures. WTO
trade monitoring reports have identified import
licensing as one of the main trade-restricting
measures introduced by governments.
WTO members raised several new and
recurring specific trade concerns before the
Committee on Import Licensing Procedures.
Australia and Canada questioned India’s
import requirements on certain pulses. The
European Union questioned Brazil’s import
licensing on industrial nitrocellulose; Egypt’s
import licensing on certain agricultural and

Safeguards
	The level of safeguard actions by
WTO members remained high, with
13 investigations launched in the
first six months of 2020 and seven
measures imposed.
	Members reviewed more than
60 specific safeguard investigations
in October at the sole meeting of
the Committee in 2020.

Background
WTO members may take
safeguard actions (impose
temporary additional duties,
quantitative restrictions
or other measures on a
product) to protect a specific
domestic industry from an
increase in imports of the
product that is causing, or
threatening to cause, serious
injury to the industry. Under
these circumstances, WTO
members have the right to
apply safeguard measures on
imports of the product from
all sources (but not from a
specific member or group of
members). The Agreement
on Safeguards provides rules
concerning the investigation
that must be conducted as
well as the application of
safeguard measures.

T

he first half (January-June) of 2020
saw 13 safeguard investigations
initiated and seven safeguard measures
imposed by WTO members. The number
of investigations had risen to 30 in full-year
2019, when 13 new safeguard measures
were imposed (see Figure 10).
Members that initiated two or more
investigations during the six months were:
Philippines (four), Ukraine (three), South Africa
(two) and Turkey (two). Indonesia imposed four
final measures during the January-June period
and Madagascar, Morocco and South Africa
imposed one each.
The share of investigations initiated in the
metals sector (the vast majority of which
involved steel products) continued to
decrease, falling from 44 per cent in the
July 2017-June 2018 period to 25 per cent in
the July 2019-June 2020 period.
More than 60 specific safeguard
investigations by WTO members were

spring meeting not taking place because of
the COVID-19 lockdown.
Australia, China, Japan and the Republic
of Korea highlighted general concerns over
the rising number of safeguard measures
taken and called on members to strictly
abide by the provisions of the Safeguards
Agreement. In this context, some members
raised concerns regarding safeguard actions
in the steel sector while others referred to
the economic situation brought about by the
COVID-19 pandemic.
The United Kingdom submitted to the
Committee its new legislation governing
trade remedies instruments, including
safeguards. The United Kingdom explained
how the new system would operate following
the end of the transition period for its exit from
the European Union on 31 December 2020.
The United Kingdom also indicated that an EU
safeguard measure on certain steel products
would be “transitioned” and would continue
to apply in respect of the United Kingdom’s
territory. Some members queried whether

featured among the
concerns raised by
WTO members in 2020.

Trade-related
investment measures
	The Committee continued to discuss
concerns regarding alleged local
content requirements.

Background
The Agreement on TradeRelated Investment Measures
recognizes that certain
measures aimed at promoting
foreign or domestic
investments can restrict
and distort trade. It states
that WTO members may
not apply any trade-related
investment measure that
discriminates against foreign
products or that leads to
quantitative restrictions, both
of which violate basic WTO
principles. An illustrative list
of prohibited TRIMs, which
often take the form of local
content requirements, is
part of the Agreement. The
TRIMs Committee monitors
the implementation of the
Agreement and allows
members to consult on
any relevant matters.

106

A

t its only meeting in 2020, the
Committee on Trade-related
Investment Measures (TRIMs)
continued its discussion of investment
measures raised by WTO members
in previous years. The concerns
expressed by members are related
to local content obligations allegedly
contained in these measures.
These concerns included measures adopted
by Russia, allegedly directing private
companies to give priority to Russian-sourced
goods, services and works over imports.
The Committee also further examined alleged
implementation by Indonesia of local content
requirements in a wide range of sectors
– 4G LTE (i.e. long term evolution) mobile
devices and base stations; telecommunication
services; retail and franchising; and the
pharmaceutical and medical device sectors –
together with alleged investment restrictions
in Indonesia’s energy and mining sectors.
The Committee took note of notifications
submitted by Vanuatu and Myanmar under
Article 6.2 of the TRIMs Agreement, which
requires WTO members to notify the
Committee of all publications in which
TRIMs may be found, including those
applied by regional and local governments
within their territory.

A

t its sole meeting in 2020, held in
November, the Working Party on
State Trading Enterprises (STEs)
reviewed 59 new and full notifications from
31 WTO members regarding the activities of
their STEs during the most recent notification
period or earlier notification periods. Members
also asked questions about specific aspects
of notifications made at previous meetings.
Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the
Working Party did not hold the meeting
originally scheduled for April 2020.
Compliance with notification obligations
remained low although some members
provided notifications for previously missing
earlier periods. For the most recent
notification period, covering 2018 and 2019,
only 33 new and full notifications were
received. For the previous notification period,
covering 2016 and 2017, only 48 new and
full notifications were received out of a total of
136 WTO members subject to this obligation.
WTO members were encouraged by the
Working Party to continue to work with their
respective capitals and the WTO Secretariat
to improve their notification record.

Trade in civil aircraft
	The Committee met once in 2020.

Background
The Agreement on Trade in
Civil Aircraft is a plurilateral
agreement that aims to
achieve maximum freedom
of world trade in civil aircraft,
parts and related equipment
– such as engines, radar,
flight recorders and ground
flight simulators – by, among
other things, eliminating
tariffs on goods listed in
its product annex. The
Committee on Trade in Civil
Aircraft provides signatories
with an opportunity to consult
on any matters relating to the
operation of the Agreement.

108

A

t its one regular meeting in 2020, the
Committee on Trade in Civil Aircraft
took note of the Chair’s report on
developments concerning the November
2015 protocol. This relates to updating the
product annex in line with the 2007 update
of the harmonized system (HS transposition),
the system used for classifying goods for
customs purposes (see page 81).

The Agreement
on Trade in Civil
Aircraft, signed by
32 WTO members,
eliminates import
duties on all aircraft
products covered
by the Agreement.

At the request of certain WTO members,
the Chair of the Committee, Damaris
Carnal (Switzerland), said that she will hold
informal consultations on how to proceed
regarding the next HS transposition of the
product annex.

had ratified the Trade Facilitation
Agreement (TFA) by the end of 2020.

TO members submitted 53
implementation notifications
informing the Committee of their
commitments with respect to fully implementing
the TFA. Thirty-eight members also provided
transparency notifications on such matters as
publication of information, “single window”
operations (where multiple transactions can
be accomplished at one contact point), use
of customs brokers and contact points for
customs cooperation. Notifications were also
received on technical assistance and capacity
building, both from donors and recipients of aid.

	Members submitted 53
implementation notifications
informing the Committee of their

A number of members highlighted
how the TFA can help ensure
essential treatments and equipment
can cross borders.

Ninety-five per cent of developing and leastdeveloped countries provided their roadmap
for the full implementation of the Agreement
through a series of implementation notifications.

	The Trade Facilitation Agreement
Facility (TFAF) assisted over
60 developing countries and
least-developed countries.

Overall, the rate of implementation of TFA
commitments stood at just under 70 per cent
for the entire WTO, the Secretariat reported in
January 2021. For developing and least-developed
countries the rate is just over 60 per cent.
Marking the third anniversary of the TFA in
February 2020, DG Azevêdo said: “Through
this landmark reform, WTO members are
working to ensure that the global trading
system creates more prosperity for people.”
The TFA will reduce trade costs globally
by expediting the movement, release and
clearance of goods across borders.

Background
The Trade Facilitation
Agreement (TFA) entered
into force in February 2017.
The TFA aims to expedite
the movement, release
and clearance of goods,
including goods in transit. It
also establishes measures
for effective cooperation
between customs and other
appropriate authorities
on trade facilitation and
customs compliance issues.
The Agreement also contains
provisions for technical
assistance and capacity
building. The Committee on
Trade Facilitation oversees
the TFA and reviews
its implementation.

Trade in services
Services waiver

	WTO members discussed how to
advance the usefulness of the services
waiver, which allows more favourable
treatment for suppliers from leastdeveloped countries.

The Least Developed Countries (LDC)
Group put forward a number of ideas to
advance the usefulness of a services waiver
for least-developed countries during Services
Council discussions. The Council is under
instructions from trade ministers “to review
and promote the operationalization of the
waiver”. The waiver allows WTO members
to grant more favourable treatment to LDC
service suppliers.

	Members engaged in e-commerce
discussions throughout the year,
focusing mainly on how to improve
digital capabilities.
	Members identified transport and tourism
as being among the services sectors
most hurt by the COVID-19 crisis.

The LDC Group proposed that the Council
organize a workshop to bring together LDC
service suppliers and consumers of LDC
services in preference-granting members.
The Council agreed that the WTO Secretariat
prepare a draft programme for the event.
The WTO has received 24 notifications
of preferential treatment in favour of LDC
services and service suppliers from 51
members (counting EU members as one),
unchanged from 2019.

Background
The General Agreement
on Trade in Services
(GATS) defines trade in
services in terms of four
types of transactions: mode
1 – cross-border supply
(a supplier in one WTO
member provides services
to a consumer in another
member’s territory); mode
2 – consumption abroad (a
consumer from one member
consumes services in
another member’s territory);
mode 3 – commercial
presence (a foreign
company provides services
through establishment in
another member’s territory);
and mode 4 – presence of
natural persons (individuals
move to supply services in
another member’s territory).
The Council for Trade in
Services oversees the
operation of the GATS.

The work programme on e-commerce
occupied the Council throughout the year.
A communication by a dozen WTO members
calling for discussions on how to support
digital capabilities generated substantive
engagement, with many delegations
presenting their own experiences and
initiatives in this area.
Members said that e-commerce plays a
vital role in fostering economic growth and
development, a fact underscored during the
COVID-19 pandemic. While acknowledging
the benefits of e-commerce, some members
called for the Council to address also
the challenges it poses and to focus on
constraints faced by developing countries
and LDCs in the digital sphere.

financial services
to distribution, has

Other issues addressed by the Council

Members discussed the impact of the
COVID-19 pandemic on trade in services
(see page 130). They identified transport and
tourism as among the sectors most hurt by
the crisis and noted that economies whose
exports are concentrated in those services
have suffered most. The pandemic has
resulted in increased trade in online services,
while also highlighting the importance of
addressing disparities in digital connectivity.
Japan and the United States reiterated
concerns about cybersecurity measures of
both China and Viet Nam. China expressed
preoccupations about Australian 5G measures,
US and Indian measures on certain mobile
apps and Indian measures on investment
approval. The United States raised concerns
about Russian measures regarding the
allocation of radio frequency bands for
foreign satellite operators, the pre-installation
of software and certain tax benefits for
domestic IT companies. Some of the concerns
expressed were echoed by other members.
The Council received 36 notifications of new
or revised measures that could significantly
affect trade in services where the notifying
members have commitments. Nine other
notifications dealt with economic integration
agreements covering services trade and
another 12 concerned recognition measures
in services sectors.
Financial services

The Committee on Trade in Financial Services
organized a thematic seminar on “FinTech:

112

Trade, Financial Inclusion
and Development” in July. At a
Committee meeting following the
seminar, some members shared their
domestic experiences, while others
suggested topics for further discussion.
Specific commitments

The United States proposed that the
Committee on Specific Commitments
examine commitments under the General
Agreement on Trade in Services, whose entry
into force, implementation or updating had
been made conditional on the adoption of
new legislation or the review of pre-existing
regimes. The Secretariat prepared a factual
compilation of conditional commitments in
members’ schedules and the Committee
agreed to continue the discussion.
The Committee also briefly returned to
the issue previously raised by the Kyrgyz
Republic that some members’ schedules of
commitments on mode 4 – the movement of
individuals across borders to supply services
– are ambiguous and opaque.

E-commerce plays a vital role
in fostering economic growth
and development, a fact
underscored during the
COVID-19 pandemic.

In a virtual symposium, participants reflected
on the evolution and impact of the most
comprehensive multilateral treaty on IP

time of crisis due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

A report submitted to
the General Council
in December 2020
highlighted WTO
members’ common
goal of providing
access to affordable
vaccines and
medicines for all.

In July, the second edition of a trilateral study,
“Promoting Access to Medical Technologies
and Innovation: Intersections between public
health, intellectual property and trade”, was
launched by the WTO, the World Intellectual
Property Organization (WIPO) and the World
Health Organization (WHO). An introductory
section entitled “An integrated health, trade
and IP approach to respond to the COVID-19
pandemic” maps the multiple challenges
posed by the pandemic in relation to the
health, trade and IP policy frameworks set out
in the study.
The WTO Secretariat issued a note in
October on the role and key contributions
that the global IP system can make to
address COVID-19. The note also provides

TRIPS and public health continued to be
addressed in various technical cooperation
activities organized by the WTO Secretariat
as part of cooperation with the WHO and
WIPO and with other multilateral and
regional partners.
In October, the Secretariat organized, at the
request of members, a technical workshop on
“An Integrated Health, Trade and Intellectual
Property Approach to Address the COVID-19
Pandemic” with the cooperation of the WHO
and WIPO secretariats. The objective was
to build capacity to assess domestic health
systems, intellectual property regimes
and trade policy and to use these tools
effectively in an integrated way to respond
to the pandemic.
COVID-19

The TRIPS Council discussed IP-related
measures members have taken in the context
of the COVID-19 pandemic, based on a
compilation entitled “COVID-19: Measures
Regarding Trade-Related Intellectual Property
Rights” maintained by the Secretariat on the
WTO website.

The TRIPS
Council discussed
IP measures
members have
taken in response
to COVID-19.

At its October and December meetings,
the Council discussed a proposal by India
and South Africa for a temporary waiver of
certain TRIPS obligations in relation to the
“prevention, containment or treatment” of
COVID-19. A status report was submitted
to the General Council in December (see
page 69) indicating a lack of consensus on
the issue and highlighting the common goal
shared by WTO members of providing access
to high-quality, safe, efficacious and affordable
vaccines and medicines for all.

Promoting transparency

The Council
discussed a
proposal by India
and South Africa
for a temporary
waiver of certain
TRIPS obligations.

In 2020, 21 WTO members notified the
TRIPS Council of new or updated IP
legislation. To date, 138 WTO members
have notified their TRIPS implementing
legislation. In addition, 112 members have
provided responses to a checklist notifying
the essential elements of their systems for
enforcement of IP rights and 145 have notified
contact points for cooperating with each other
on eliminating trade in IP-infringing goods.
Members’ notifications constitute an important
source of information.
At the Council meetings, several members
provided further background on their
respective notified legislation. The Council
was also briefed on IP policy matters raised
in Trade Policy Reviews and TRIPS-related
measures covered in G20 and WTO-wide
trade monitoring reports (see page 128).
The e-TRIPS gateway and the online
submission system for WTO members are

streamlining the submission and management
of notifications and other transparency
materials and providing user-friendly access
to all TRIPS-related materials. Transparency
training webinars were held in July 2020 with
the aim of explaining to members how to use
the system to submit reports on technology
transfer and technical cooperation to the
TRIPS Council. The Secretariat has also
provided tailor-made training to delegates on
the use of e-TRIPS.
Incentives for technology transfer

In February 2020, the Council concluded its
17th annual review of reports provided by
developed countries on incentives granted
to promote and encourage the transfer of
technology to LDCs, as provided for by
Article 66.2 of the TRIPS Agreement. The
capital-based experts who had attended
a preceding workshop contributed to
discussions during the Council’s conclusion
of the review and presented a proposal to
streamline reporting procedures. The Council
started its 18th review in October.
TRIPS non-violation and
situation complaints

The TRIPS Council continued its discussion
of the application of so-called non-violation
and situation complaints. The question
is whether members can bring disputes
where an expected benefit from the TRIPS
Agreement has been nullified, even if there is
no specific violation. The current moratorium
on such complaints has been further extended
until the 12th Ministerial Conference.
Plants, animals, biodiversity and
traditional knowledge

The Council continued its discussion on the
patentability of plant and animal inventions, the
relationship between the TRIPS Agreement
and the Convention on Biological Diversity
(CBD) and the protection of traditional
knowledge and folklore.

115

-----------------------Page 117 End-----------------------

I M P L E M E N TAT I O N A N D M O N I TO R I N G

WTO members reiterated their positions
on whether the TRIPS Agreement should
be amended to prohibit the patentability
of life forms and whether – and, if so, how
– it should do more to promote the CBD
objectives of authorized access and equitable
sharing of the benefits from the use of
genetic resources and associated traditional
knowledge in other members’ jurisdictions.
Technical cooperation and
capacity-building

The WTO Secretariat organized briefings
for delegates on non-violation and situation
complaints and, for newly arrived delegates,
on the work and mission of the TRIPS
Council. A national seminar requested by
Uzbekistan helped to increase awareness of
TRIPS-related issues in preparation for the
country’s WTO accession negotiations and
domestic implementation of legislation.
The WTO continued its IP and Trade Policy
Today Seminar series, including an edition
in February 2020 on the protection of nontraditional trademarks under international
and comparative IP law and another in June
on internet platform liability for copyright
infringement.
The TRIPS Council undertook the review of
technical cooperation and capacity building on
the basis of reports submitted by developed
countries and international organizations.

116

New publications

The second edition of “A Handbook on the
WTO TRIPS Agreement” was published in
November. It describes the historical and
legal background to the TRIPS Agreement,
its role in the WTO and its institutional
framework. In addition, in 2020 WIPO and
the WTO jointly published the ninth and
tenth editions of the WIPO-WTO Colloquium
Papers, a series of peer-reviewed academic
papers resulting from the WIPO-WTO
Colloquium for IP Professors.

A workshop on
incentives for
technology transfer
to LDCs under the
TRIPS Agreement was
held in Geneva on 4-6
February 2020.

IP and innovation

The Council continued its information
exchange on IP and innovation, focusing on
public-private collaborations. Members shared
their experiences and domestic policies
designed to promote IP commercialization
and making micro, small and mediumsized enterprises more competitive through
trademarks and the protection of IP.
IP and the public interest

WTO members continued their discussions
on the relationship between IP and
the public interest. They focused on
research and development costs and
the pricing of medicines and health
technologies, the so-called three-step
test regarding copyright and a more
holistic approach to TRIPS flexibilities.

At the November Committee meeting and
during Trade and Environment Week, several
WTO members presented trade policies
adopted to ensure a sustainable economic
recovery from COVID-19. Speakers noted
the importance of aligning trade policies with
efforts to “build back better” and accelerate the
transition to greener, lower-carbon economies.

At the November Committee meeting, two
groups of WTO members launched new
initiatives aimed at concrete trade and
environment outcomes by the 12th Ministerial
Conference scheduled for late 2021. The first
consists of structured discussions on trade
and environmental sustainability; the second
is an informal dialogue on plastics pollution
and environmentally sustainable plastics trade
(see page 62).

Costa Rica shared its experience on combining
sustainable living and international trade. The
European Union briefed delegations on its
European Green Deal, which aims at achieving
net zero emissions of greenhouse gases by
2050. It includes plans for a carbon border
adjustment mechanism (see page 73). Several
delegations welcomed the transparency
exercise and underlined the importance of
respecting WTO rules.

Reform of fossil fuel subsidies

New Zealand continued to update WTO
members on recent developments related
to fossil fuel subsidy reform, which seeks
to rationalize and phase out subsidies that
encourage wasteful consumption. A group
of ministers issued a statement at the
11th WTO Ministerial Conference urging
“ambitious and effective disciplines on
inefficient fossil fuel subsidies”.
New Zealand said renewed efforts would
be made to introduce subsidy reforms in the
context of unprecedented economic stimulus
packages being launched for the recovery
from the COVID-19 pandemic. Some
members reiterated their view that the WTO
is not an appropriate venue for such matters.

I

n 2020, activities in the Working Group
on Trade and Transfer of Technology
proceeded on the basis of presentations
made by El Salvador, Saint Lucia and South
Africa. Two of these involved descriptions
of initiatives and programmes undertaken to
promote the generation, management and
transfer of technology. The third presentation
was on the relationship between trade and
technology transfer.

Background
The Working Group on
Trade and Transfer of
Technology was established
at the Doha Ministerial
Conference in 2001 “to
examine the relationship
between trade and transfer
of technology and to make
recommendations on steps
that might be taken, within
the mandate of the WTO, to
increase flows of technology
to developing countries”.

The Least Developed Countries Group
underscored the critical role technology plays
in increasing productivity and output, and in
diversifying economies so they can better
integrate into regional and global value chains
and enhance their development. It noted that
those countries most technologically equipped
are best prepared to deal with the COVID-19
pandemic and its related challenges.

the WTO to increase flows of technology to
developing countries.
A group of members stated their willingness
and availability to assist in updating a proposal
entitled “Facilitating Access to Information on

Regional trade
agreements
	The WTO received 59 notifications
of regional trade agreements (RTAs)
currently in force, compared with
15 in 2019. Of these notifications,
45 involved the United Kingdom.
	The 59 notifications concern 37 RTAs,
of which 30 involve the UK.
	The number of RTAs (including
accessions to existing RTAs)
reviewed by WTO members under the
transparency mechanism for RTAs
rose to 200, involving 124 members.

Notifications

WTO members submitted 59 notifications
of regional trade agreements (RTAs), with
45 of them involving the United Kingdom.
Excluding agreements with the UK, which
left the European Union on 31 January 2020,
notifications would have been little changed
with regard to the 15 received in 2019. The
59 notifications concern 37 RTAs, of which 19
cover trade in goods only and 18 cover trade
in goods and services.

Background
The Committee on
Regional Trade Agreements
(CRTA) monitors all RTAs
notified to the WTO,
except those notified
under special provisions
for agreements between
developing countries (the
Enabling Clause), which
are considered by the
Committee on Trade and
Development. The CRTA
considers RTAs individually
and considers the systemic
implications of RTAs for the
multilateral trading system.

45

Of the 59
notifications
received from
WTO members,
45 involved the
United Kingdom.

Twenty-nine of the RTAs are between
developing and developed partners, while
seven are between developed partners. One
involves developing partners. Because of
the UK, Europe was involved in the highest
number of RTAs (32), followed by the
Americas and the Asia Pacific regions (11
each), Africa (seven), the Middle East (four)
and the Commonwealth of Independent
States (three). Twenty-eight of the agreements
covered members from two different regions.
Total RTA notifications stood at 758 on
31 December 2020, of which 541
concern RTAs in force (see Figure 12).
RTAs are reciprocal preferential trade

The goods and services aspects of RTAs and
accessions to existing RTAs are notified
and counted separately. If all three elements
are counted together, the notifications
involved 532 individual RTAs, of which
335 were in force.
WTO members continued to urge that
RTAs should be notified in a timely manner.
The number of RTAs not notified stood at 54
in November, down from 81 in October
2019. The WTO Secretariat issues a list of
RTAs in force but not notified before each
meeting of the Committee on Regional
Trade Agreements. The number decreased
considerably following the notification of
changes made by parties to the Latin
American Integration Association.

In 2020, the CRTA considered 17 notifications
of RTAs, counting goods, services and
accessions separately, compared with 20 in
2019 and 22 in 2018. The CTD considered
six RTAs.

Out of the 59
notifications of
regional trade
agreements submitted
to the WTO in 2020,
19 covered trade
in goods only while
18 covered trade in
goods and services.

Non-discrimination among trading partners
is a core principle of the WTO. RTAs are
authorized providing they adhere to a number
of rules under WTO agreements.
Monitoring RTAs

All RTAs are subject to the WTO’s
transparency mechanism for RTAs. The
mechanism provides specific guidelines on
when a new RTA should be notified to the
WTO Secretariat and the related information
and data to be provided. It also requires the
Secretariat to prepare a factual presentation
on each RTA, and that each RTA be reviewed
by WTO members.
By the end of 2020, 200 RTAs currently in
force (including accessions to RTAs), involving
124 WTO members, had been reviewed.
RTAs notified under the General Agreement
on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and the General
Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) are
considered by the Committee on Regional
Trade Agreements (CRTA), while RTAs
notified under the Enabling Clause
(see page 73) are considered by the
Committee on Trade and Development (CTD),
based on the WTO Secretariat’s factual
presentation (see Table 3).

335

As of the end of
2020, 335 regional
trade agreements
were in force.

124

Under the transparency mechanism,
WTO members are encouraged to inform
the Secretariat of any agreements being
negotiated or that have been signed but
have not entered into force (so-called early
announcements). They are required to inform
the Secretariat of any changes to a notified
agreement and to provide a report once an
agreement is fully implemented.

The transparency mechanism also requires
the WTO Secretariat to prepare “factual
abstracts” on RTAs already examined by
the Committee. By the end of 2020, 70
factual abstracts of agreements in force
and two of inactive agreements (counting
goods and services notifications separately)
had been prepared in consultation with
the relevant RTA parties and posted in
the RTA database. The Secretariat has
completed all the factual abstracts required
under the mechanism.
In 2020, no early announcements were
received from members, maintaining
at 110 the total number received as of
December 2020. Seventy-two of these were
subsequently notified to the WTO following
entry into force of the agreements.
Under the transparency mechanism, the
CRTA also discusses end-of-implementation
reports for RTAs, which are short written
reports on how the liberalization commitments
have been put into effect. They are important
for understanding whether RTAs accomplish
what they set out to do. The CRTA Chair,
Mārtiņš Kreitus (Latvia), noted that reports
had been due for 145 RTAs as of 15 April
2020, up from 139 the year before. Only one
report was received during the year.
The General Council established the
transparency mechanism on a provisional
basis in 2006. Members are required to
review the legal relationship between the
mechanism and relevant WTO provisions
on RTAs. The Negotiating Group on Rules
started the review in 2011. At the 10th
Ministerial Conference in Nairobi in
December 2015, ministers called on
WTO members to work towards making
the mechanism permanent.

The WTO has
conducted 508
reviews of the
trade policies of
WTO members.

Trade and investment policies and the
overall economic situation were discussed
during the review meetings. In-depth
discussions took place on key trade issues,
such as tariffs, use of trade remedies, regional
trade agreements, non-tariff trade barriers,
protection of intellectual property, and the role
of state-owned enterprises.

Background
The Trade Policy Review
Mechanism is the WTO’s
transparency pillar, aiming
to improve members’
adherence to WTO rules
and thus to the functioning
of the multilateral trading
system. Through its regular
Trade Policy Reviews,
the mechanism enables
members to collectively
examine the trade policies
and practices of individual
members in all trade-related
areas. Reviews are not
intended to serve as a
basis for the enforcement
of obligations or for dispute
settlement procedures.

126

he Trade Policy Review Body (TPRB)
reviewed the trade policies of seven
members in 2020: Australia; the
European Union; Indonesia; Japan; Macao,
China; Thailand; and Zimbabwe. Most of
the reviews were held virtually. The TPRB
rescheduled 12 other reviews for 2021
because of the pandemic. The review of
Tajikistan, which would have been its first, was

Trade monitoring reports
	Between mid-October 2019 and
mid-October 2020, the number
of trade-restrictive and tradefacilitating measures introduced
by WTO members saw a marked
slowdown. This was mainly the
result of the sharp decline in overall
global trade since the start of the
COVID-19 outbreak.
	The trade coverage of importfacilitating measures over the
12-month period was US$ 731.3
billion (up from US$ 544.7 in the
previous period) while importrestrictive measures stood at
US$ 440.9 billion (down from
US$ 746.9 billion).
	Trade remedy initiations, such
as anti-dumping investigations,
significantly increased, with the
trade coverage of such actions
estimated at US$ 68.8 billion,
up from US$ 46.2 billion.
	In addition, WTO members
implemented 335 measures directly
linked to the COVID-19 pandemic.
COVID-19 related trade-facilitating
measures covered an estimated
US$ 227.2 billion of goods trade
while COVID-19 trade-restrictive
measures covered trade worth
US$ 179.8 billion.
	In response to the pandemic, WTO
members also adopted measures
relating to trade in services and
intellectual property, mostly with the
aim of facilitating trade. Governments
also put in place over 1,000 economic
support measures worth several
trillion US dollars to address the
economic downturn caused by the
pandemic and to prepare the ground
for economic recovery.

128

B

etween mid-October 2019 and
mid-October 2020, WTO members
introduced the lowest number of
“regular” trade-restrictive and trade-facilitating
measures on goods since 2012 – that is,
those unrelated to the COVID-19 pandemic.
The trade coverage of import-restrictive
measures fell to US$ 440.9 billion, from
US$ 746.9 billion in the previous period (see
Figure 14) while the coverage of importfacilitating measures rose to US$ 731.3
billion, up from US$ 544.7 billion
(see Figure 15).
The fall in the trade coverage of importrestrictive measures was mainly the result
of the sharp decline in global trade flows,
governments shifting attention to fighting the
pandemic, and a general commitment to keep
trade flowing (see page 76).

Background
The WTO began regular
monitoring of global trade
developments in early 2009,
covering all trade-related
measures implemented
by WTO members and
observers. Initially launched
in the context of the global
financial crisis, the trade
monitoring exercise has
become a regular function
in the WTO that further
strengthens the transparency
aims of the Trade Policy
Review Mechanism by
shedding light on the latest
trends in the implementation
of policy measures that
facilitate as well as restrict
the flow of trade. The trade
monitoring is overseen by the
Trade Policy Review Body.

Import-facilitating

Note: These figures are estimates and represent the trade coverage of the measures (i.e. annual imports of the products concerned from economies affected
by the measures) and not the cumulative impact of the trade measures. Liberalization associated with the 2015 Expansion of the WTO’s Information Technology
Agreement is not included in the figures. Trade measures related to COVID-19 are not included.

The stockpile of import restrictions
implemented since 2009, and still in force,
stood at around 8.7 per cent of world imports
at the end of 2019, up from 7.5 per cent
in 2018 (see Figure 16). By mid-October
2020, the trade coverage of the stockpile
was estimated at US$ 1.7 trillion, compared
with US$ 1.6 trillion at the end of 2019.
Trade measures related to COVID-19 are not
included in the stockpile data.
WTO members implemented 699 “regular”
trade measures over the latest period, of which
89 were trade-restrictive, 88 trade-facilitating
(e.g. eliminating or reducing tariffs and
simplifying customs procedures for imports
and exports). A total of 522 were trade remedy
actions, such as anti-dumping investigations,
countervailing measures and safeguards,
confirming that these measures remain an
important policy tool for WTO members.
The trade coverage of trade remedy actions
initiated over the review period was estimated
at US$ 68.8 billion, up from US$ 46.2
billion in the previous period. Trade remedy
terminations fell to US$ 9.9 billion from US$
24.8 billion. Trade remedy actions account

A N N U A L R E P O R T 2 0 21

for 75 per cent of trade measures recorded on
goods in the latest monitoring report.
At the same time, WTO members implemented
335 measures directly linked to the COVID-19
pandemic, including 195 considered as
trade-facilitating and 140 which could be
considered trade-restrictive. The trade coverage
of COVID-19 trade-facilitating measures
implemented since the beginning of the
pandemic was estimated at US$  227.2 billion
while the coverage of COVID-19 trade-restrictive
measures was an estimated US$ 179.8 billion.
Around 39 per cent of the restrictive measures
implemented in response to the pandemic had
been repealed by mid-October.
In addition, WTO members put in place over
1,000 COVID-related economic support
measures. The number and variety of support
measures implemented in response to the
pandemic is greater than that witnessed during
the 2008-09 global financial crisis. These
measures target sectors of the economy
heavily affected by the crisis, including health,
aviation, tourism and catering. They include
monetary, fiscal and financial measures as well
as broader stimulus packages.

Note: The cumulative trade coverage estimated by the WTO Secretariat is
based on information available in the Trade Monitoring Database (TMDB)
on import measures recorded since 2009 and considered to have a traderestrictive effect. The estimates include import measures for which HS codes
were available. The figures do not include trade remedy measures. Measures
related to COVID-19 are not included. The import values were sourced from
the UNSD Comtrade database.

The latest monitoring report also showed that
services sectors were heavily affected by
the COVID-19 pandemic although the extent
varied across sectors and modes of supply.
Most of the 124 COVID-related measures
adopted by WTO members in the services
sector appeared to be trade-facilitating. Many
intellectual property measures were also
introduced to promote innovation and facilitate
access to COVID-related health technologies.
Status of the reports

The WTO Secretariat prepared four reports
on global trade policy developments in 2020,
including two on trade measures by G20
economies. The trade monitoring reports have
no legal effect on the rights and obligations of
WTO members and do not seek to pronounce
on whether a trade measure is protectionist or
question the explicit right of members to take
certain trade measures.
Consultations

In November, an informal consultation on
the trade monitoring exercise took place
among WTO members. The objective of
the meeting was to continue discussions
from the July informal meeting of the Trade
Policy Review Body (see page 126) on the
Director-General’s Trade Monitoring Report
regarding ways to further improve this
transparency exercise.
During the consultations, suggestions were
made with respect to both procedural and
substantive issues. Further consultations will
be held during 2021.

Most of the 124 COVID-related measures
adopted by WTO members in the services
sector were considered to be trade-facilitating.

Trade, debt and finance
	The WTO joined multilateral
development banks and private
sector organizations to mobilize
trade finance and keep essential
goods and medicines flowing
during the pandemic.
	WTO members presented policy steps
implemented by their governments to
address the situation, such as trade
loan repayment extensions and
deferral schemes.
	Together with six heads of multilateral
development banks, the WTO DirectorGeneral issued a statement in July
pledging greater coordination in
providing support to trade finance
markets, particularly towards
developing countries.

Background
WTO ministers decided in
2001 to establish a Working
Group on Trade, Debt and
Finance to look at how the
WTO could contribute to
finding a durable solution to
the external debt problems of
many developing countries
and to avoid having WTO
members’ trade opportunities
undercut by financial
instabilities. The Working
Group has been focusing
its attention on a range of
financial issues with an
impact on trade, including
the provision of trade finance
and the relationship between
exchange rates and trade.

he availability of trade finance, already
in short supply in developing countries
and for smaller businesses, was
further disrupted in 2020 by the COVID-19
pandemic. The situation became critical again
12 years after the great financial crisis had
seriously limited financing flows.
At the July meeting of the WTO Working
Group on Trade, Debt and Finance, several
members from Africa, Latin America and Asia
noted that since the beginning of the global
pandemic in March, trade finance shortages
had increased. The shortages were impeding
imports of goods and medical equipment
necessary to fight the pandemic and the
export of essential goods from their countries.
They described operational difficulties,
including the lack of availability of documents
for the processing of trade finance requests,
payment refusals by buyers and increased
difficulties for micro, small and medium-sized
enterprises (MSMEs) in obtaining trade loans
and repaying them.
The MSME dimension was particularly
emphasized since a large majority of traders
in developing countries are MSMEs. WTO
members also described policy steps
implemented by their governments to address
the situation, such as trade loan repayment
extensions, deferral schemes and credit
guarantee schemes.

of trade finance as a pressing issue
requiring international support and

a statement in July pledging greater
coordination in providing support to trade
finance markets, particularly towards
developing countries. “This marks the first time
the major multilateral development banks have
lined up together in support of trade finance
markets. This will serve as a force multiplier
for their future efforts,” the DG said.
The WTO issued a similar statement with
private sector leaders – the International
Chamber of Commerce and B20, the
business arm of the G20 – warning that gaps
between trade finance supply and demand
could seriously impede the ability of trade to
support post COVID-19 economic recovery.

Agreement on
Government Procurement
	Switzerland accepted the revised
Agreement on Government Procurement
(GPA), meaning it has come into force
for all parties.
	The United Kingdom acceded to the
Agreement in its own right after leaving
the European Union.
	Brazil became the first Latin American
country to apply to join the GPA.
	Parties continued to discuss China’s sixth
revised market access offer and examined
a new update of its checklist of issues.
	Côte d’Ivoire became an observer to
the Committee.

Background
The GPA aims to open
up, based on principles
of reciprocity, and to the
extent agreed between
WTO members, government
procurement markets to foreign
competition, and to make
government procurement more
transparent. It provides legal
guarantees of non-discrimination
for the products, services
and suppliers of GPA parties
in procurement covered by
the Agreement. The GPA is a
plurilateral agreement — open
to all interested WTO members
and binding only the parties to
it. Currently, 48 WTO members
are covered by the Agreement.
Any WTO member can apply
for accession. The Committee
on Government Procurement
administers the GPA.

A N N U A L R E P O R T 2 0 21

Entry into force of the revised
GPA for all parties

Switzerland completed the final step for
its participation in the revised Government
Procurement Agreement, submitting its
instrument of acceptance to the WTO on
2 December 2020. This means that, as of
1 January 2021, the revised GPA is in force
for all parties, replacing the previous text.
The revised version, which was adopted
in 2012, strengthens the GPA’s role in
promoting good governance, including
through e-procurement, combating corruption
and protecting the environment. Switzerland’s
ambassador to the WTO, Didier Chambovey,
said: “Switzerland attaches great importance
to a strong rules-based trading system,
including through plurilateral agreements
such as the GPA.”
Accessions to the GPA

Following a decision adopted by the WTO
Committee on Government Procurement
in October 2020 regarding the United
Kingdom’s accession to the GPA in its own
right, the United Kingdom deposited its
instrument of accession on 2 December
2020. On 1 January 2021, the Agreement
entered into force for the United Kingdom,
whose transition period for its exit from the
European Union ended on 31 December.
United Kingdom Ambassador Julian
Braithwaite said accession would ensure
continued access for foreign suppliers to
the United Kingdom’s procurement markets,
worth GBP 68 billion annually under its
market access offer.
In May 2020, Brazil submitted its application
to join the GPA – the first Latin American
country to do so. The Committee praised
Brazil for sending a powerful signal of market
opening amid the COVID-19 crisis. Parties
also applauded Brazil for quickly circulating

Dispute settlement
activity in 2020
	WTO members initiated five disputes in
2020, down from 20 in 2019. On average,
37 panel and arbitral proceedings were
ongoing each month.
	Eleven dispute settlement reports and
decisions were circulated.
	Dispute settlement proceedings continued
despite COVID-19 restrictions, with panels and
arbitrators using additional written procedures
or remote technology to advance work.
	Members did not reach consensus on
launching the selection process for the
appointment of new Appellate Body members.
No new appeals could be heard in 2020.
	The WTO issued a new “GATT Dispute
Settlement Reports” compendium, bringing
together for the first time all dispute settlement
reports issued under the General Agreement
on Tariffs and Trade between 1948 and 1995.

Background
WTO members can bring disputes
when they consider their rights are
being infringed with respect to any
agreement contained in the Final
Act of the Uruguay Round that is
subject to the Understanding on
Rules and Procedures Governing
the Settlement of Disputes (DSU).
The General Council convenes as
the Dispute Settlement Body (DSB)
to deal with disputes. The DSB
has authority to establish dispute
settlement panels, to adopt panel and
Appellate Body reports, to maintain
surveillance over the implementation
of recommendations and rulings,
and to authorize suspension of
concessions and other obligations
in the event of non-compliance with
those recommendations and rulings.

138

Activities in 2020

In 2020, there was an average of 37 ongoing
panel and arbitral proceedings each month
(see Figure 4).
The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic
affected the functioning of the dispute
settlement system. Lockdowns and travel
restrictions prevented panellists, arbitrators
and delegations of WTO members from
participating in in-person meetings in
Geneva. In cooperation with parties, and
with assistance from the WTO Secretariat,
a number of panels and arbitrators used
additional written procedures or remote
technology to advance work, including in some
cases to substitute for in-person meetings.
The Appellate Body was reduced to one
member as of December 2019 and was
therefore unable to hear new appeals in 2020.
As of 30 November 2020, all seven positions
on the Appellate Body were vacant. WTO
members did not reach consensus to launch
the selection processes for the appointment
of new Appellate Body members.
New disputes

During 2020, WTO members filed five
requests for consultations – the first stage in
the dispute settlement process – concerning
allegedly WTO-inconsistent measures (see
Table 1). This figure, down from 20 in 2019,
is the lowest level of disputes initiated in a
calendar year since the inception of the WTO.

a so-called “compliance” panel (China
– Agricultural Producers, DS511) was
established to determine whether China had
complied with previous recommendations and
rulings. In one panel proceeding, EU – Price
Comparison Methodologies (DS516), the
panel’s authority lapsed on 15 June 2020
as the work of the panel had been suspended
for more than 12 months.
Two requests on the permissible level of
retaliation – as a temporary remedy in the
event of non-compliance – were referred
to arbitration (see Table 3).

Each member is appointed for
a term of four years, with the
possibility of being appointed
for one further four-year term.
Three members of the Appellate
Body hear an appeal of a panel’s
ruling. Any party to a dispute
may appeal the panel report
to the Appellate Body. The
appeal is limited to issues of law
covered in the panel report and
legal interpretations developed

Figure 4 shows the intensity of dispute
settlement activities since the inception of
the WTO in 1995.
For the purposes of Figure 4, each
proceeding (original panel or appeal, Article
21.5 panel on compliance or appeal and
arbitration) is counted as a single instance
where it relates to the same matter, regardless
of the number of complainants involved.
This provides a quantitative indication of the
number of distinct issues that are subject
to active dispute settlement proceedings.
Figure 4 does not seek to reflect the relative
complexity of different proceedings, which
has also tended to increase over time.

Five appeal proceedings were initiated in
2020 (see Figure 3 and Table 7). However,
as of the end of 2020, members had not
reached consensus on launching the
selection processes for the appointment of
new Appellate Body members. Following the
expiry of the term of office of Appellate Body
member Zhao Hong on 30 November 2020,
all the positions on the Appellate Body were
vacant. No new appeals could be heard in
2020. As of December 2020, 16 appeals
were pending before the Appellate Body
(see Table 7).

In 2020, the WTO issued a new “GATT
Dispute Settlement Reports” compendium,
bringing together for the first time all dispute
settlement reports issued between 1948 and
1995 under the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade (GATT) and related instruments,
including the Tokyo Round plurilateral
codes. The six-volume set complements
“GATT Disputes 1948-1995”, a two-volume
publication that looks into the evolution of
dispute settlement under the GATT.

Jackson Moot Court Competition
on WTO law

A total of 76 universities representing
37 WTO members and observers
participated in regional rounds held in
February and May 2020 of the annual
John H. Jackson Moot Court Competition.
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, four
regional rounds (American, African, and
South and East Asian) took place virtually.
The top 20 teams qualified for the final
round held in June. After four days of
competition, four teams went through
to the semi-finals, with the winning team
being the Government Law College,
Mumbai (India).
The John H. Jackson Moot Court
Competition is a simulated hearing under
the rules of the WTO dispute settlement
system involving exchanges of written
submissions and adversarial hearings
before panellists on international trade law
issues. The competition is organized by
the European Law Students’ Association
(ELSA) with the technical support of
the WTO. In 2018, the competition was
named after John H. Jackson, an eminent
scholar and a forefather of the multilateral
trading system.

Trade and
development

	The Committee discussed in May 2020
the decline in exports for many WTO
members due to COVID-19. Developing
countries with limited resources were
the most affected.
	The WTO, the International Trade Centre
and the UN Conference on Trade and
Development launched the Sustainable
Development Goals (SDGs) Trade
Monitor, which collates progress on
meeting trade-related SDGs.

Background
The Committee on Trade
and Development is the
focal point for the
coordination of all work
on trade and development
issues in the WTO. The
Committee deals with a
variety of issues, including
all developmental issues,
technical cooperation and
training, and notifications
under the Enabling Clause,
which allows developed
countries to give more
favourable treatment to
developing countries.

146

Activities in 2020

WTO members discussed the COVID-19
outbreak at a virtual session of the Committee
on Trade and Development in May 2020.
Several members reported a decline in their
exports, noting that developing countries
with limited resources were the most affected
by the crisis, especially those whose exports
are concentrated in a small range of goods.
The Committee continued work on the
link between trade and development, as
instructed by trade ministers. It also continued
discussions on electronic commerce and dutyfree and quota-free (DFQF) market access
for least-developed countries (LDCs).
A dedicated session was held on the
monitoring mechanism on implementation
of special and differential treatment (S&D)
provisions, such as technical assistance, for
developing countries in WTO agreements
and decisions. The Chair, Mohammad Qurban
Haqjo (Afghanistan), noted that no written
inputs or submissions, which are required for
the exercise, had been presented. He urged
members to come to a common understanding
on how to move forward with the mechanism.
Montenegro notified the Committee of its
DFQF scheme for LDCs and Kazakhstan
notified its Generalized System of Preferences,
under which developed countries grant
preferential tariffs to developing countries.
Documents relating to the Latin American
Integration Association were circulated and
considered by the Committee.
The Committee considered the preferential
trade agreement between the Southern

Southern African Customs Union, the free
trade agreement between the Association
of Southeast Asian Nations and the Republic

between India and Afghanistan and the
accession of Egypt to the Common Market
for Eastern and Southern Africa. The
Committee also considered the economic
complementarity agreement between Mexico
and the Plurinational State of Bolivia, and
the comprehensive economic partnership
agreement between India and the Republic
of Korea.
SDGs Trade Monitor

In October, the WTO, the International
Trade Centre (ITC) and the UN Conference
on Trade and Development (UNCTAD)
launched the Sustainable Development
Goals (SDGs) Trade Monitor. The online
portal collates the latest progress in
achieving the trade-related SDGs of the
United Nations. It allows users to conduct
customized analysis of trade-related SDG
indicators, with the objective of improving
understanding of the relationship between
trade and development in the SDG agenda
and highlighting the latest state of play in
achieving the relevant SDG targets.

The WTO Secretariat undertook 278
technical assistance activities in 2019 and
participated in several other related activities.
Overall, 14,500 participants received
training, representing a decrease of 37 per
cent on 2018. This decline was partly due,
particularly among LDC beneficiaries, to
participants having to use a new cloud-based
platform and registration process. The WTO
provided guidance to address the problems.
The Committee took note of the
Secretariat’s technical assistance monitoring
and evaluation plan and was briefed by
the ITTC on a new simplified procedure
to request national technical assistance
activities online. In addition, the Committee
was introduced to the new format for the
annual performance report on technical
assistance and training. Prepared by the
Secretariat, it includes testimonials, quotes
and interviews with various stakeholders
and showcases good practice.

278

The WTO
undertook 278
technical assistance
activities in 2019 for
developing countries.

The ITTC presented new technical assistance
dashboards, launched to help members,
donors and others track the implementation
of WTO technical assistance and training
programmes. They will help developing
countries strengthen their trade capacity
and participate more effectively in global trade.

Technical cooperation and training

The Institute for Training and Technical
Cooperation (ITTC) provided updates on
technical assistance. Face-to-face technical
assistance activities were disrupted in midMarch 2020 by the COVID-19 outbreak.
However, online training courses continued
through the e-Campus.

Least-developed countries
	The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic
on the economies of least-developed
countries (LDCs) featured prominently
in the work of the Sub-Committee.
	In the first half of 2020, LDCs’
merchandise exports fell 16 per cent.
Services exports dropped by around
40 per cent.
	The WTO Secretariat updated members
on the ongoing EIF-WTO project, which
aims to help LDCs better comprehend the
trade-related implications of graduation
from LDC status.

COVID-19 and support for LDCs

In addition to discussing standing items on
the agenda, the Sub-Committee on LDCs
provided an opportunity to exchange views
on the trade-related impact of the COVID-19
pandemic on LDCs. The UN Conference on
Trade and Development and the World Bank
shared their respective analyses, warning of
severe consequences for LDCs due to their
vulnerabilities and lack of financial resources.
The LDCs highlighted the need for global
cooperation to help them recover from the
crisis, including through assistance for
healthcare systems and economic recovery.
Market access for LDCs

The trade-related impact of the pandemic took
centre stage in WTO members’ discussions
on market access.
The WTO Secretariat’s yearly report on market
access for LDCs included a special chapter
on trade developments during the first half of
2020. LDCs entered the pandemic with
a trade deficit of US$ 100 billion and a decline
in exports of goods and services of 1.5 per cent
in 2019. LDCs’ share of global exports was only
0.96 per cent in 2019, little changed over the
past few years.
Background
The Sub-Committee on
LDCs, established in July
1995 as a subsidiary body
to the Committee on Trade
and Development, focuses
its work on an agreed WTO
work programme for LDCs.
This programme looks at a
number of systemic issues
of importance to LDCs in the
multilateral trading system,
such as market access,
technical assistance and
accession to the WTO.

148

In the first half of 2020, LDCs’ merchandise
exports declined by 16 per cent, steeper than
the 13 per cent decline for world exports.
LDCs’ exports dropped significantly for fuels
and mining products (down 26 per cent) and
clothing (down 18 per cent), while exports of
agricultural products were less affected (down
1 per cent). LDCs’ services exports dropped

LDCs and other low-income countries benefited
from 71 per cent of STDF’s project funds in
2019, well above its target of 40 per cent.

conditions of trading partners. They called on
WTO members to continue making progress
in the implementation of ministerial decisions
on duty-free and quota-free market access
(see page 146), preferential rules of origin (see
page 99) and the LDC services waiver (see
page 111) to enhance their exports. Members
underlined the need to continue to monitor trade
developments in LDCs during the pandemic.

The Executive Secretariat of the Enhanced
Integrated Framework (EIF) updated members
on EIF activities, including actions taken to
mitigate the impact of the pandemic (see page
154). LDCs highlighted the importance of the
current EIF programme for trade capacitybuilding and commended the EIF for taking
measures during the pandemic to continue
project implementation and activities under
the programme.
The Secretariat of the Standards and Trade
Development Facility (STDF) noted that LDCs
and other low-income countries benefited from
71 per cent of project funds in 2019, well above
the STDF target of 40 per cent (see page
157). The LDCs underlined the important role
played by the STDF in helping them to comply
with sanitary and phytosanitary requirements to
access international markets.
Accession of LDCs to the WTO

The WTO Secretariat briefed WTO members
on the state of play of eight ongoing LDC
accessions (Bhutan, Comoros, Ethiopia, São
Tomé and Príncipe, Somalia, South Sudan,
Sudan and Timor-Leste) (see page 32).

LDC graduation

The WTO Secretariat briefed members
on progress in the implementation of the
EIF-WTO project on graduation from LDC
status, including the publication of the report
“Trade Impacts of LDC Graduation”. The
project helps LDCs better comprehend the
trade-related implications of graduation from
LDC status.
The LDCs expressed appreciation for the
WTO’s work in support of graduating LDCs.
They also called on WTO members to be

The Committee on Trade and Development
adopted the 2020-21 Aid for Trade Work
Programme entitled “Empowering Connected,
Sustainable Trade”. It subsequently extended
it until 2022 when the next Aid for Trade Global
Review will be held.
The work programme will focus on the
opportunities that digital connectivity and
sustainability offer for economic and export
diversification and how Aid for Trade can help
empower different economic actors to realize
these opportunities. Members agreed to adapt
the programme to reflect the economic impact
of COVID-19.

Committee on Trade and Development

The Committee on Trade and Development
held three sessions on Aid for Trade at which
the negative impact of COVID-19 on the

trade and their access to trade finance emerged
as key concerns. A number of members
and international organizations updated
the Committee on Aid for Trade activities,
implementation and resource mobilization.

Thematic events

In 2020, the WTO held two Aid for Trade
thematic events. The first was a workshop on
the role of Aid for Trade in transforming and
promoting rural economies through capacity
building, financing programmes and multistakeholder dialogue. The second surveyed
research on the economic and trade impact
of COVID-19 (see page 76) and measures
being taken to support the response to the

Enhanced Integrated Framework
Support for LDCs during COVID-19

	Early in the COVID-19 pandemic,
the Enhanced Integrated Framework
(EIF) launched a business continuity
plan to address risks and to
maintain support for least-developed
countries. The aim was to ensure the
continued rollout of EIF projects.

Early in the COVID-19 crisis, the EIF
established a business continuity plan that
identified and addressed risks and set out
measures to maintain support to leastdeveloped countries (LDCs). Ongoing EIF
projects allowed swift analysis of the impact
of COVID-19 on trade in the LDCs.

	In 2020, 28 new projects worth
US$ 21.3 million were approved.

The EIF financed
training in Benin for
pineapple producers
to improve production
quality, profitability and
trading opportunities.

In Zambia, an EIF project implemented
through the International Trade Centre
(ITC) facilitated assessment of new
challenges faced by women-led businesses
and provided support, such as training in
e-commerce. In Cambodia, the pandemic
accelerated interest in e-commerce,
resulting in the adoption of a national
e-commerce strategy.

Background
The Enhanced Integrated
Framework (EIF) is the
only multilateral partnership
dedicated exclusively to
assisting least-developed
countries in their use of trade
as an engine for growth,
sustainable development and
poverty reduction. The EIF
partnership of 51 countries,
24 donors and eight partner
agencies works closely with
governments, development
organizations, civil society
and academia. Together, they
leverage collective knowhow to tackle the world’s
most pressing trade for
development issues. The
WTO houses the Executive
Secretariat for the EIF.

ê  Success story

The business continuity plan also focused
on ensuring the continued rollout of EIF
projects, contributing to the delivery of over
90 per cent of planned projects for the year.
In total, 28 new projects worth US$ 21.3
million were approved in 2020. Projects
included institutional capacity support for
Vanuatu to ease its transition from LDC status,
development of key agriculture export sectors
in the Central African Republic and enhanced
sustainability in Nepal’s tea sector.
Four projects were approved under the EIF’s
“Empower Women, Power Trade” initiative,
launched in 2019. A new partnership with the
World Association of Investment Promotion
Agencies focused on improving the business
climate to attract sustainable investment and
leverage additional resources in the LDCs.

Making it easier for South Asian
women to take businesses online
A new e-commerce training programme will
help hundreds of women entrepreneurs in
South Asia become part of regional and global
supply chains.
Developed by the EIF, in partnership with
the United Nations Economic and Social
Commission for Asia and the Pacific
(UNESCAP), the training programme is helping
women entrepreneurs across South Asia to
better understand the challenges involved
in implementing e-commerce. Workshops
have already been organized in Bangladesh,
Bhutan and Nepal, helping at least 100 female
entrepreneurs sell their goods and services
online and become part of regional and global
supply chains.
An e-commerce portal is also being
developed to host the online shops of women
entrepreneurs participating in the programme.
“The portal will assist women with digitizing
and cataloguing their goods and services.
It will provide a single payment gateway
and it will give their businesses international
exposure. This is all the more important for
women entrepreneurs in this hour of crisis
due to COVID-19,” said Rajan Sudesh Ratna
from UNESCAP.
Thinley Yangzom, an entrepreneur in Bhutan,
said: “Being able to sell online will make
it possible for me to reach international
customers, and will also make my products
more affordable for local people. With the
support provided by this programme, it will
be faster and easier to grow my business
than if I was to do it alone.”

Building human capacity
through partnerships

The EIF conducted several online training
courses on topics such as monitoring,
evaluation and learning (MEL), resource
mobilization, risk management and EIF
evaluations. An innovative secondment
programme saw MEL staff from LDCs
attached to the EIF Executive Secretariat, with
the first secondees coming from Senegal and
Tanzania. Partnering with the International
Islamic Trade Finance Corporation, the EIF
launched “Building Trade Finance Capabilities
in LDCs”, under which LDC government
officials are mentored to support their
countries’ resource mobilization efforts.
Global engagement during COVID-19

With nearly 100 stories published on its
Trade for Development News platform,
the EIF became an important source of
information during the pandemic, gathering
more than 80,000 views.

156

The EIF launched a social media campaign,
#PowerUpTrade, encouraging LDC
businesses to share how COVID-19 was
affecting their participation in global value
chains. Contributions ranged from information
on a coffee supply chain in Ethiopia to the
impact of the pandemic on garment workers in
Bangladesh. The EIF worked with international
partners, including the ITC and the WTO, on
the project, which reached over 318,000 users
on Twitter, LinkedIn and Facebook.

participants and on-demand viewers.
LDC graduation

In May 2020, the EIF and the WTO published
“Trade Impacts of LDC Graduation” looking at
how graduation may affect LDCs’ participation
in world trade, including their access to export
markets and implications for their WTO
commitments (see page 181).
Delivering strong project systems

Strengthened project evaluation guidelines
were rolled out to support accountability
and learning processes across EIF projects.
Innovative monitoring mechanisms are being
piloted, with increased linkages with local
partners, to closely follow implementation
in remote areas.

integrate them into global value chains and
allow them to compete in the world market.
Women are heavily involved in spices in
India, from sowing to harvesting and preprocessing. The project, which will run over
three years, will help women farmers to
produce higher-quality products and obtain
higher prices, improving their social and
financial status.

“The project is expected to help
boost incomes of small-scale
farmers, empower women and
other marginalized communities,
and support efforts to reduce

international trade policy,
we have also learned how integral
trade is to global economic growth

E-learning

Internship programmes

In 2020, the majority of government officials
completing WTO internship programmes
were from LDCs and other low-income
countries in Africa and the Asia and Pacific
regions. Nineteen participants completed
the French and Irish Missions Internship
Programme and 16 participants completed
the Netherlands Trainee Programme. Both
programmes lasted ten months. Six interns
participated in the Regional Coordinator
Internship Programme and four in the
Accession Internship Programme.
Young Professionals Programme

Following a merit-based selection
process, 12 young professionals (seven
women and five men) were recruited for
the Young Professionals Programme in
2020. All came from members currently
without any professional staff in the WTO
Secretariat. Funded by the Global Trust
Fund, the programme aims to improve
the opportunities for young professionals
from nationalities under-represented at the
WTO to be recruited by the WTO or other
international organizations.
Financing technical assistance

The bulk of the technical assistance
programme is financed by the Global Trust
Fund through voluntary contributions from
WTO members. Excluding some fluctuations,
there has been a steady decrease in voluntary
contributions for a decade. In 2020, total
contributions were CHF 5.6 million, down
from CHF 6.2 million in 2019.
Other funding sources include the WTO
regular budget for Geneva-based courses
and national technical assistance activities –
CHF 4.5 million for 2020 – and contributions
from other trust funds (such as the French
and Irish Missions Internship Programme,
the Netherlands Trainee Programme and the
China Programme), which totalled CHF 2.4
million in 2020.

“I was thrilled to learn about the new
series of courses released in 2020 by
the WTO e-learning unit. I had high

I completed eight courses covering
WTO subjects such as trade in services,
sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS)

Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA) and
intellectual property rights.
All of the courses were relevant.
The SPS course has guided me in
policy discussions at work while the
TFA course helped me to propose
polices aimed at reducing bureaucratic

Trade and women’s
empowerment
	The WTO continued its work on
understanding how trade can
create opportunities for women
entrepreneurs and examined how
COVID-19 has impacted women’s
ability to trade.
	The WTO launched a joint report
with the World Bank on “Women
and Trade: The role of trade in
promoting gender equality”.

T

he WTO Trade and Gender Action
Plan 2017-19 was extended to 2020,
with work continuing on its four key
objectives: raising awareness on the link
between trade and gender; facilitating WTO
members’ actions on trade and gender;
generating new data and research on the
impact of trade on women; and providing
training on these issues.

Background
In 2017, the WTO appointed
a Trade and Gender Focal
Point to lead work on trade
and gender in the WTO. The
WTO seeks to build a more
inclusive trading system,
raise awareness on the link
between trade and gender,
facilitate WTO members’
actions on trade and gender,
generate new data on the
impact of trade on women
and provide training to
government officials.

the Action Plan

Raising awareness

trade and gender

Facilitating WTO
members’ actions on
trade and gender

Generating new

on the impact of
trade on women

Providing training
on these issues

In July, the WTO and the World Bank
published a joint report on “Women and
Trade: The role of trade in promoting gender
equality”. It was launched by the then WTO
Director-General, Roberto Azevêdo, and
World Bank Managing Director Mari Pangestu.
“The report comes out at an opportune time.
The COVID-19 pandemic has provoked the
deepest economic recession of our lifetimes.
Recent WTO analysis shows that women risk
losing some really hard-won progress towards
greater gender equality because of this crisis,”
DG Azevêdo said.
Building on new analysis and data broken
down by gender, the report aims to identify
ways that trade can improve the lives of
women. It shows how trade and trade policy
can affect men and women differently – in
terms of wages, consumption and welfare
and in the quality of jobs available to them.
The new analysis suggests that expanding
trade can act as an impetus for countries
to improve women’s rights and boost their
participation in the economy.
A WTO Secretariat information note
(see page 77) issued in August – “The
economic impact of COVID-19 on women in
vulnerable sectors and economies” – showed

A N N U A L R E P O R T 2 0 21

-----------------------Page 166 End-----------------------

that women are likely to be harder hit than
men by trade disruptions caused by the
pandemic. The risks are particularly acute in
developing countries.
The WTO, the International Trade Centre and
the UN Conference on Trade and Development
organized a webinar on “Applying a gender
lens to WTO”. Presentations were made by
experts on defining the concepts behind a
“gender lens” – the examining of all aspects of
work from a gender perspective. Presentations
included how to apply a gender lens when
implementing WTO rules and agreements.
Over 100 representatives of WTO members
and observers attended the event.
International Women’s Day has become a
highlight in the WTO Secretariat’s calendar.
The 2020 international women’s day campaign
put the spotlight on “Generation Equality:
Realizing Women’s Rights”. The then DirectorGeneral, Roberto Azevêdo, told a special
WTO event on 6 March: “Promoting women’s
empowerment and gender equality is a moral
imperative as well as an economic one.”
In 2020, the WTO continued its work
on understanding how trade can create
opportunities for women entrepreneurs.

A N N U A L R E P O R T 2 0 21

Together with partners, it conducted a survey in
Latin America, complementing data collected in
similar surveys in 2019 in South Asia and East
Africa. Over 350 women entrepreneurs were
surveyed. The findings confirmed results of the
previous surveys that lack of knowledge about
trade rules and procedures is an important
barrier to women entrepreneurs in integrating
into international markets.

A report issued by the
WTO and the World
Bank in 2020 aimed to
identify ways in which
trade can improve the
lives of women.

The WTO evaluated 20 training programmes
of regional and international institutions,
including the private sector, finding that none
adequately address lack of knowledge about
trade rules among women entrepreneurs.
During 2020, the WTO also conducted
interviews with women entrepreneurs in South
Asia to understand how COVID-19 impacted
their businesses, trade and lives. The WTO
has gathered this information into a database.

A WTO Secretariat note highlighted
that women are likely to be harder
hit than men by trade disruptions
caused by the pandemic.

Contact with the
business community
	The International Chamber of Commerce
and the WTO stressed how business can
help identify ways to maximize health
outcomes and minimize economic
damage from COVID-19.

Together with the ICC and the B20, the business
group of the G20, the WTO issued a statement
in July warning that the diminishing availability
of trade finance could hamper post-pandemic
economic recovery (see page 132).

	A virtual “Trade Dialogue” debated trade
policy measures to improve responses to
the pandemic. It called for COVID-related
restrictions to be targeted, proportionate,
transparent and temporary.

Virtual Trade Dialogue

Business, the global trading system
and COVID-19

In a joint statement on 2 April 2020, then
WTO Director General Roberto Azevêdo and
International Chamber of Commerce (ICC)
Secretary-General John Denton expressed
concern at the severe disruptions to value chains
brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic.
These disruptions had major implications for
employment and the supply of goods, especially
essential medicines and food.
The statement stressed that business can help
identify solutions that maximize health outcomes
while minimizing economic damage. It called
for more dialogue with business to mitigate the
economic damage resulting from the COVID-19
pandemic, particularly with regard to trade.

Background
Business and the WTO have
always been closely connected. The
private sector is a major beneficiary
of transparent and predictable trade
rules and obligations. Business is
an important interlocutor for both
governments and the WTO. It is
actively involved in the multilateral
trading system and participates in
public activities of the WTO.

The ICC and B20 collaborated with the
then Director-General, Roberto Azevêdo, to
facilitate a virtual Trade Dialogue session in
May 2020 with the private sector on trade’s
role in mitigating the economic damage
resulting from the pandemic.
Over 70 business representatives from developed
and developing countries discussed trade policy
responses that could help businesses combat the
effects of the crisis and debated the role the WTO
could play.

In a virtual Trade
Dialogue, over
70 business
representatives
discussed how trade
policy responses
could help
businesses combat
the pandemic.

They stressed the importance of maintaining
an uninterrupted supply of essential goods
and services and for any COVID-19-related
trade restrictions to be targeted, proportionate,
transparent and temporary. They also called for
effective and rapid implementation of the WTO’s
Trade Facilitation Agreement (see page 109).
Participants underlined the importance of
international policy coordination and urged
governments to resist protectionism, calls for
self-sufficiency and reshoring. Governments were
urged to see that trade is complementary and
essential for domestic production. Participants
emphasized the WTO’s role in urging members
to be transparent about COVID-related measures
and in gathering examples of best practice in
trade-related responses to the crisis.
Support for the WTO

On the occasion of the WTO’s 25th anniversary,
senior representatives from business
organizations sent video messages reflecting on
what the WTO and the multilateral trading system
means to them (see page 171).

25th anniversary of the WTO
On 19 November, the WTO hosted a virtual event to commemorate its 25th
anniversary. “WTO at 25: Past, Present & Future” looked at the organization’s
achievements and current challenges. Participants underlined the importance
of the multilateral trading system as well as the need for reform to strengthen
the WTO to deal with global challenges, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.

I

n his keynote address, Swiss
Federal Councillor Guy Parmelin
said the COVID-19 crisis
has underlined the relevance of
rules-based free trade, as open
markets and uninterrupted global
supply chains are fundamental for
access to medicines and other
essential products. General Council
Chair David Walker said WTO
members’ ability to update and
adjust the WTO rulebook
“is ultimately the only way to
keep the WTO relevant to our
economies and to foster our trade
relations”. Deputy Director-General
Alan Wolff called for institutional
and substantive reforms to achieve
the WTO’s mission.

A political perspective
A high-level panel with government
officials reflected on the role of the
WTO in shaping their economies
(see Table 1). Speakers considered
the benefits and shortcomings of the
global trading system and discussed
ways to make it more inclusive.
Panellists agreed that WTO reform
must be a priority to ensure the
organization’s continued relevance.
Despite differences on what the reform
agenda should look like, all government
representatives reiterated the need to
reinvigorate the WTO’s negotiating
function and deliver a meaningful
outcome on fisheries subsidies
(see page 53).

In March 2020, the then Director-General,
Roberto Azevêdo, welcomed a commitment
by leaders of the G7 group of developed
countries to support global trade and
investment in the face of the COVID-19
pandemic and to do “whatever is necessary
to ensure a strong global response
through closer cooperation and enhanced
coordination”. DG Azevêdo said:
“The global challenge requires a global

With the United Nations Conference on
Trade and Development (UNCTAD) and the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD), the WTO continued
to publish six-monthly reports on trade and
investment measures in G20 countries. The
November report noted a slowdown in the
number and coverage of these measures,
primarily as a result of the sharp decline in
overall global trade since the COVID-19
outbreak (see page 128).

The heads of the WTO and the International

April 2020 to refrain from imposing export
and other trade restrictions on key medical

“Amid the COVID-19 crisis, keeping trade
open and fostering a favourable business
environment will be critical to spur the
renewed investment needed to meet the
SDGs.”- WTO Secretariat report

OECD

The OECD and the WTO cooperate in a
range of areas, including in the trade in valueadded (TiVA) database and in improving the
measurement of digital trade (see page 185).
They are working together on the development
of trade facilitation indicators, with an
interactive web tool covering 152 countries.
The WTO and OECD have started their joint
work on the preparations for the next Global
Review of Aid for Trade to be held in 2022.
The OECD was also an active participant
in preparing the Aid for Trade Stocktaking
exercise, which was held in March 2021
(see page 152).
United Nations

DDG Wolff attended the autumn meeting of
the United Nations Chief Executives Board
(CEB), composed of the executive heads of
UN agencies, funds and programmes and
the executive heads of the IMF, the World
Bank and the WTO. He made the case for
reinvigorated international cooperation on trade
to accelerate the response to COVID-19.

UNCTAD, ITC and
UN regional commissions

UNCTAD, the International Trade Centre
(ITC) and the WTO jointly produce the
annual World Tariff Profiles (see pages 180
and 182) and quarterly and annual statistics
on international trade in services. They
also combine in statistical capacity-building
activities, including training and
e-learning courses.
The WTO’s cooperation with the UN
Economic and Social Commission for Asia
and the Pacific (UNESCAP) has grown,
particularly in helping least-developed
countries (LDCs) that are “graduating”
from LDC status to adapt to their changing
situation (see page 149) and in helping
developing countries prepare for
Ministerial Conferences.

The WTO is part of the UN Secretary
General-led High-Level Task Force, which
brings together 23 UN agencies and
international organizations to provide policy
coordination and political leadership to
achieve the UN Sustainable Development
Goals (SDGs) related to food security and
to sustainable agriculture and food systems.
In a report to the United Nations High-level
Political Forum in July, the WTO Secretariat
said that amid the COVID-19 crisis, keeping
trade open and fostering a favourable business
environment will be critical to spur the renewed
investment needed to meet the SDGs.

M

edia attention in 2020 was focused
on the impact of the pandemic on
global trade. Press officers worked
closely with other divisions and with the
WTO web team to ensure that reports from
the WTO’s dedicated COVID-19 webpage
were widely disseminated. The media team
also organized press conferences with
WTO economists on 2020 trade forecasts
and updates, and updated journalists on
discussions within WTO councils and
committees on the pandemic’s impact
on trade (see Figure 1).
The early departure of DG Azevêdo and
the selection process for his successor
(see page 28) attracted keen press interest.
The media team kept journalists informed of
progress in the selection process from the
start and organized press conferences in
July for the eight candidates as well as DG
Azevêdo’s farewell press conference.
Press conferences and briefings were held
in hybrid format when conditions permitted
and in virtual format when restrictions were
tightened. This allowed for online participation
by non-Geneva journalists, which increased
coverage of the WTO.

T

he WTO’s flagship publication, the
“World Trade Report 2020”, explores
governments’ increasing use of policies
to foster digital innovation. It examines how
policy instruments, including trade policy,
adapt to the characteristics of the digital
economy and underlines the importance of
countries working together to encourage
positive outcomes while minimizing negative
spill-overs from national policies.
“In very recent years, spurring innovation
in the digital field is at the core of many
new government policies, which have been
adapted at all levels of development,” Deputy
DG Yi Xiaozhun said during the virtual
launch of the report in November. “Just as
the WTO fostered broadly open, predictable
and competitive markets in the wider global
economy, it can in the future play an important
role in reducing uncertainty in the market for
digital goods and services. But this will require
updating the WTO framework to address new
challenges and demands,” he added.
Global Trade Cost Index

Background
The WTO’s Economic
Research and Statistics
Division organizes regular
seminars and conferences
as well as online forums
involving academics and
researchers in Geneva
and around the world.
These activities include
the Geneva Trade and
Development Workshop
programme. It is responsible
for the WTO’s flagship
publication, the “World
Trade Report”, which aims to
deepen understanding about
trends in trade, trade policy
issues and the multilateral
trading system.

In 2020, the Economics Research and
Statistics Division finalized a two-year project
to build a WTO Global Trade Cost Index.
This research uses the estimates of bilateral
trade costs for 43 countries and 33 sectors
between 2000 and 2018. The index, which
is expected to be launched in the first half of
2021, will allow WTO members to monitor the
evolution of global trade costs and understand
what the main components of trade costs are
and who faces the largest trade costs.
New joint WTO-World Bank publication
on trade and gender

The WTO and the World Bank jointly
produced a report – “Women and Trade:
The Role of Trade in Promoting Gender
Equality” – which shows that trade can
substantially benefit women. Firms that
engage in international trade employ more
women than non-exporting firms (33 per cent

of their workforce on average compared with
24 per cent for non-exporting firms). Trade
brings better-paid jobs and improved working
conditions. In general, open economies have
higher levels of gender equality. Trade creates
an incentive to extend women’s access to
education, technology and legal rights.
The report identifies three trends that can
further empower women economically: the
rise of the services economy, the development
of global value chains and the adoption of
digital technologies. The WTO has a key role
to play, the report stresses. Ongoing talks
related to services, agriculture (which employs
a large number of women in developing
countries), electronic commerce and micro,
small and medium sized enterprises are key to
identifying and eliminating barriers to women’s
participation in trade.
Trade Economist Thematic Award

The WTO launched a new competition for
thematic research, which focused in 2020 on
how the COVID-19 pandemic has affected
trade and trade policy. Majune Kraido
Socrates of the University of Nairobi won the
Trade Economist Thematic Award for 2020.
His paper, “The Effect of Lockdown Policies
on International Trade Flows from Developing
Countries: Event Study Evidence from Kenya”,
was praised by the Selection Committee.
He received a prize of CHF 5,000.

WTO Essay Award for Young Economists

The winner of the 2020 WTO Essay Award for Young
Economists was Xiang Ding of Harvard University for his paper
“Industry Linkages from Joint Production”. He received a prize
of CHF 5,000.
Xiang Ding’s paper provides novel and important evidence
on cross-industry linkages, particularly joint production
arising from industries sharing knowledge inputs, such as
research and development, information technology and other
professional services.
The paper finds that in multiple product firms, a rise in demand
in one client industry also increases the firm’s sales to other
industries. These positive cross-product linkages are only
found where industries share knowledge inputs. Knowledge
inputs have a special role in joint production because they allow
capital to be more flexibly deployed across a firm’s various
products to find its best match.
These findings have implications for the re-evaluation of
trade restrictions. It finds that there is less of a tendency for
protectionist policies to raise consumer prices if the measures
are focused on knowledge-intensive industries. When industries
share knowledge, producer prices fall or increase less not only
in industries that are directly protected, but also in industries that
are jointly produced. According to the Selection Panel, the paper
is likely to have a substantial impact on trade policy.
Xiang Ding is from Hong Kong, China. He received his Ph.D. from
Harvard University in 2020. He is currently Assistant Professor at
Georgetown University, Walsh School of Foreign Service.
Selection panel

The Selection Panel for 2020 comprised Beata Javorcik
(Professor of Economics, University of Oxford), Robert
Koopman (Director, Economic Research and Statistics Division,
WTO), Robert Staiger (Professor of Economics, Dartmouth
University) and Alberto Trejos (Professor of Economics, INCAE

chains on an
unprecedented scale.

The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted
international trade and global supply
chains on an unprecedented scale. WTO
statistics on trade flows, services and market
access barriers provided accurate and
timely information for policymakers. WTO
statisticians contributed to various reports
and studies to provide information on the
significant impact on economies and people.
Two WTO Secretariat information notes on
medical goods trade – “Trade in Medical
Goods in the Context of Tackling COVID-19”
– released in April and December were
among the most consulted of the Secretariat’s
COVID-19 notes and WTO statistics added
insights to various other studies published by
the Secretariat.
Monthly and quarterly analyses of a large
range of products and services helped
monitor trade flows during the COVID-19
pandemic and track trade recovery. Statistics
on trade in personal protective equipment,
such as face masks, stressed the key role of
trade in allowing countries to secure access
to critical medical supplies.
Statistical publications and data series

The “World Trade Statistical Review 2020”,
the WTO’s flagship statistical publication,
offered a detailed analysis of trends for world
trade in goods and services, including in
value-added terms. It also provided insights
into the impact of COVID-19 on trade. “Trade
Profiles 2020” provided a series of key
indicators on trade in goods and services for
197 economies while “World Tariff Profiles
2020” supplied information on tariffs and nontariff measures taken by over 170 countries
and customs territories.

with the goal of improving the coverage of
Africa in the OECD and other global TiVA
databases. Training activities for African
statisticians and a regional seminar involving
Cameroon, Côte d’Ivoire, Egypt, Nigeria and
Senegal were held online in 2020.
WTO statisticians contributed to joint online
courses and webinars with UNCTAD, the
United Nations and regional statistical agencies
for developing economies, exchanging
knowledge on best practices in data collection,
compilation and analysis of merchandise trade
and trade in services statistics. Online tools
to obtain and disseminate market access

measuring digital cross-border transactions
around which national efforts can be
targeted. It also provides a mechanism
to bring together existing national and
international efforts on measuring digital
trade or dimensions of it that could be used
to identify and develop best practice.
A dedicated online portal for tracking traderelated Sustainable Development Goals was
launched (https://sdgtrade.org/). The initiative
streamlines reporting and has led to enhanced
cooperation with the International Trade
Centre and UNCTAD.
The WTO joined the international statistics
community in the effort to assess the
impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. It
contributed to the UN publication on “How
COVID-19 is Changing the World: A
Statistical Perspective”, published in May
and September, focusing on trade in medical
goods and on export restrictions.
I-TIP

The WTO’s Integrated Trade Intelligence
Portal (I-TIP) is regularly updated to increase
the information available on non-tariff
measures, services trade policies and trade
statistics. As of the end of 2020, more than

Cooperation with
academic institutions
	The WTO Chairs Programme (WCP) generated
substantial research on trade issues. Chairs
from the last four-year cycle of the WCP
published 56 articles in peer-reviewed journals
and issued seven books.
	The year saw a significant increase in WCP
outreach events involving governmental
policymakers, businesses and civil society
groups. The 59 activities organized by the
chairs of Phase II represent a threefold
increase compared with the previous year.
	In December, applications were invited for a
third phase of the Chairs Programme. The
WTO received a strong increase in applicants
compared with the previous four-year cycle.
	An independent evaluation recommended
doubling the size of the programme to 40
chairs, with a special focus on universities
from least-developed countries.

Background
The WTO Chairs Programme (WCP),
launched in 2010, aims to enhance
understanding of the trading system
among academics and policymakers
in developing and least-developed
countries. Chair-holders are selected
through a competitive process. The
main objectives of the WCP are to
create a network fostering research
on trade issues, to provide teaching
support for the development and
delivery of courses on trade policy and
WTO matters, to organize outreach
activities to disseminate research,
and to provide policy advice to
governmental and other stakeholders.
The WCP is housed in the WTO’s
Knowledge Management Academic
Outreach Division.

Activities of the Chairs Programme

The 19 academic chairs from the first two fouryear phases of the WTO’s Chairs Programme
(WCP) continued research, teaching and
outreach to policy-makers in 2020 on topics
related to the multilateral trading system.
Phase II chairs alone delivered 28 trade-related
courses and diploma programmes, reaching
over 2,100 students and Ph.D. candidates.
The research output of the WCP was again
substantial. Phase II chairs published 56
articles in peer-reviewed journals, issued
seven books on WTO matters and prepared
45 working papers with policy relevance for
governments and other stakeholders.
The year also saw a high number of outreach
events, with 59 activities organized by
phase II chairs. The wider use of webinars
and other virtual formats because of the
COVID-19 pandemic attracted a large number
of participants, including policymakers, the
business community, civil society groups and
academic networks.
The WCP e-Platform, a dedicated website,
continued to facilitate information-sharing
to encourage discussion and to promote
networking among institutions and individuals
associated with the programme.
Preparing for phase III

An independent external evaluation of the
WCP was commissioned at the conclusion of
phase II at the end of 2018. The report was
very positive. It recommended a significant
scaling up of the programme to 40 chairs, with
a special focus on universities from leastdeveloped countries and from countries that
have not yet benefited from the programme,
including recently acceding WTO members.
In July, the WTO created the Knowledge
Management Academic Outreach Division

Advisory Board members and chair-holders
“One of the unsung virtues of the WTO Chairs
Programme has been its catalytic role in
prompting South-South discussions of trade
and cross-country learning.”
Richard Newfarmer, Country Director for Rwanda, Uganda and
South Sudan, International Growth Centre.

“The WTO Chairs Programme is the only one among
the WTO’s many technical assistance programmes
designed to boost the capacity of developing countries
by training the next generation of policymakers.
The chairs in many countries have become the
‘go-to’ think-tanks on trade issues.”
Henry Gao, Associate Professor of Law at Singapore Management
University, Dongfang Scholar Chair Professor at Shanghai Institute
of Foreign Trade

“The WTO Chairs Programme has been a valuable
tool to enhance the knowledge of the trading system
in developing countries.”
Désirée van Gorp, Professor of International Business at Nyenrode
Business Universiteit, Visiting Professor at MIP Politecnico di Milano,
Italy, and at Renmin University in Beijing, China.

(KMD). It has a section dedicated to
academic outreach activities and the launch
of the WCP’s third phase, providing a solid
institutional footing for the future of the
programme. A call for applications for chairs
for the next four-year cycle of the programme
was issued in December 2020. This generated
a strong response, with applicants far
exceeding the number for the previous phase.
The WTO Secretariat continued its close
interaction with the WCP Advisory Board,
an external body composed of scholars
who mentor the current chairs. The Board
is providing advice and assistance to the
Secretariat for the next four-year cycle of
the programme.

“Where governments are open to broadening
their policymaking perimeters, partnering with
chair-holders and their teams promotes better
informed views on trade policy formulation
and its evaluation, enhancing its quality and
legitimacy. The Chairs Programme has …
heightened the policy relevance of academic
research and helped attract promising talent to
a field that is central to sustained progress in
governance and development.”
Pierre Sauvé, Senior Trade Specialist, Trade and
Competitiveness Practice, World Bank Group

“With the recognition that we have received
from the WTO for our research … we have been
able to form close and strategic partnerships,
not only in Southern Africa, but also in East,
West and North Africa. Because of the Chairs
Programme, we are in a very different place
from where we would have been.”
Wilma Viviers, Research Professor of International Trade,
North-West University, South Africa

Foreign Trade and Economic Attractiveness,
representing two key donors of phase II
of the programme.
Academic Support Programme

WTO staff delivered lectures for undergraduate
and postgraduate courses as part of activities
implemented in 2020 under the Academic
Support Programme (ASP). The cooperation
was undertaken in virtual formats because of
the COVID-19 pandemic. The ASP engages
with academic institutions from developing
countries and least-developed countries that
are not part of the WTO Chairs Programme.

A WTO book compiling various contributions
by chairs, Advisory Board members and
WTO staff, entitled “Adapting to the Digital
Trade Era: Challenges and Opportunities”,
was published in January 2021. The book, the
third published under the Chairs Programme,
considers how technological advancement,
such as the growth of e-commerce and the
development of blockchain technology, may
contribute to inclusive growth.

Several of the activities were related to
supporting university competitions on WTO
law and increasing knowledge of dispute
settlement procedures among students and
professors. In particular, the WTO provided
support to the John Jackson Moot Court
competition (see page 143), including by
providing staff to act as panellists in regional
inter-university competitions and for the final
round of the competition. A particular challenge
was adapting the competition to a virtual format
due to the pandemic.

The publication contains a foreword by Sigrid
Kaag, the Netherlands’ Minister for Foreign
Trade and Development Cooperation, and
Franck Riester, France’s Minister Delegate for

In addition, the WTO continued encouraging
universities to register academics as
participants in online courses offered by
the WTO’s E-campus.

WTO Secretariat
	In spite of the challenges posed by the COVID-19
pandemic, the Human Resources Division was fully
operational in 2020, with no disruptions to core activities.
	Support was provided to staff during the pandemic via
a health task force and through the medical service.
	WTO recruitment activity remained high, with 49 vacancies
filled in 2020. The Human Resources Division continued
to reallocate resources to high-priority areas.
	Work began on the “Workday Implementation and Service
Enhancement” project, a cloud-based HR/payroll system
which will go live in 2021.

A Health Task Force (HTF) was established
in response to the pandemic. This played a
key role in ensuring the health and safety of
WTO staff and the smooth running of the
organization’s main activities.

The Secretariat is composed mostly of
economists, lawyers and specialists in
international trade policy. There are also
specialists in IT, communications, statistics,
finance, human resources and language
services (see Figure 3 and Table 1). The
working languages of the WTO are English,
French and Spanish.

624

The WTO has a
total of 624 staff.

The WTO established a Health
Task Force to ensure the health
and safety of WTO staff during
the pandemic.

192

Due to the pandemic, all learning and
development initiatives were conducted
virtually. These included workshops on
ethics, learning networks, peer coaching,
executive coaching, mentoring, information
technology (IT) and language training, and
external management programmes. New virtual
initiatives included webinars on virtual training
techniques for technical assistance trainers
and managing teams virtually, a motivational
speakers series and activities
on diversity and inclusion.
The WTO’s recruitment activity remained
high, with 49 vacancies filled in 2020. The
overall number of staff increased to 624.
Secretariat staff come from 79 WTO
members (see Figure 4).

In spite of the challenges posed by the
COVID-19 pandemic, activities remained
high in all areas of the Human Resources
Division, with no disruptions to core activities.

The HTF included representatives from
various divisions, the Medical Service and the
Staff Council. Its role included keeping staff
abreast of new COVID-19 developments,
following up with staff members suffering
from COVID-19 symptoms, and coordinating
with other international organizations and the
Swiss authorities.

The Medical Service introduced measures
to support staff affected by the pandemic
and to keep the premises safe. It also
provided statistics on COVID-19 cases
within the WTO and proposed measures
to mitigate risks to staff.

Secretariat staff on the regular budget
comprise professional and support service
categories (Figure 2). Professional staff
account for 62 per cent of the total and
support service staff 38 per cent. Women
continue to outnumber men at the WTO, by
336 to 288 (see Figure 1). Among professional
staff, 45 per cent are female and 55 per cent
male, compared with 42 per cent and 58 per
cent, respectively, in 2014.
The Human Resources Division continues
to respond to the evolving needs of the
Secretariat by reallocating resources to high-

Mateo Reyes-Chiappe
Interpreter | Administration and General
Services Division
Nationality: Colombian
Joining date: 1 May 2020

Interpreting for the WTO is not for the
faint-hearted. From my earliest days as
an interpreter in Colombia, I was aware
of the reputation of WTO interpreters,
known for their rigour, expertise and skill
at handling complex, high-stakes, fastpaced meetings. Coming here was like
joining an all-star team.
For 15 years I was a freelance
conference interpreter in Ottawa, Boston
and Bogotá. I worked for the United
Nations, International Monetary Fund
and World Bank, as well as for medical
conferences, presidential debates,
literary festivals, field expeditions and
peace agreement ceremonies.
WTO delegates appreciate being able
to express themselves in any of the
three official languages, secure in the
knowledge that their messages will
be delivered intact. For interpreters,
this necessitates delving into the
literature, keeping abreast of an everchanging range of subjects, making
split-second decisions and using textual
and contextual cues to deliver a clear,
accurate rendition. Sometimes we work
up a sweat, but it’s deeply gratifying.

priority areas, such as the legal sections,
particularly the Rules Division. Staffing
measures take into account the limitations
imposed by WTO members, including the
overall cap on the budget and personnel.
Various methods of informal resolution of
workplace disputes continue to be available
to staff. The WTO has an independent
psychologist for staff seeking assistance
with psychological and social support. This
is in addition to the external and internal
mediators, the Head of the Office of Internal
Oversight (OIO) and the Legal Counsel to
the Administration.
Fourteen new young professionals joined the
Young Professionals Programme in January
2021, working in 11 different divisions. The
programme aims to increase the number of
professionals in the WTO Secretariat from
developing and least-developed countries
under-represented in the organization
(see page 163).
A new division was created in July – the
Division for Knowledge and Information
Management, Academic Outreach and WTO

Chairs Programme (see page 186). The division
develops and coordinates WTO knowledge
information management policies and is
responsible for academic outreach activities.
In 2017, HR embarked on an initiative to
provide a more modern and effective service
to staff. The strategy has two elements:
improve and streamline processes,
identifying gaps and areas for improvement
within HR operations; and implement a
new cloud-based HR information system
with self-service functionalities.
The implementation of a user-friendly, cloudbased HR/payroll platform called “Workday”
began in August 2020. The first phase
consists of HR core activities within the
areas of recruitment, absence, payroll,
benefits and compensation. Self-service
functionalities will be available for employees
and managers, with a launch date scheduled
for the latter half of 2021.
The second phase, involving learning and
development, performance management and
advanced compensation, will be available from
mid-2022. Workday will offer a simpler way of
carrying out HR interactions, with the platform
accessible from desktops and mobile devices.
It will also provide access to additional data,
such as development opportunities, making it
easier for staff to take informed decisions.
Based on the policy, “Right to Work in
an Environment free from Discrimination,
Harassment and Abuse of Authority”, launched
in 2018, the Learning Service worked in
conjunction with an external learning provider
to produce a four-part “Respect & Harmony”
e-learning course. To date, approximately
80 per cent of staff members have taken it.
Webinars entitled “Conversations about
Ethics”, including scenarios on everyday ethical
dilemmas, were developed for all staff in 2020.
Issues pertaining to discrimination are being
addressed via a series of virtual learning events
on diversity and inclusion.

Ayten Dersan
Chief of Documents Management, Monitoring
and Production Section | Language and
Documentation Services Division
Nationality: Belgian
Joining date: 16 April 2020

Before joining the WTO, I worked at the
Translation Centre for the Bodies of the
European Union, a Luxembourg-based
agency offering language services to
EU institutional customers. I joined the
Translation Centre in 2004 as a translations
workflow administrator, managing the
planning of documents and translations.
Subsequently, I managed the team that
revamped the EU terminology database.
I then became a business development
manager. In my last two years in that role,
I was engaged in implementing
a “transformation programme” to
analyse, evaluate and overhaul our
division’s working practices, processes
and technology.
I feel privileged to have joined the team
of specialists that manages the WTO
language and documents requests.
Recently, we launched a programme
called “Astra” to transform and develop
our processes, technology and team
structure. I am excited to have participated
in this programme and to be contributing,
together with my colleagues, to giving new
momentum to our working methods and
tools. I strongly believe that, by committing
ourselves to targeted excellence, our
team can implement best practices in our
working methods.

Budget, finance
and administration
	The Committee recommended that the General Council
approve the 2021 budget.
	The Committee recommended that the accumulated
budgetary surplus be transferred to the Working
Capital Fund.

T

he Committee on Budget, Finance
and Administration recommended
that the General Council approve
the 2021 budgets for the WTO and the
International Trade Centre (see Table 2).
The Committee reviewed the quarterly
reports on the financial and extra-budgetary
situation of the WTO, the 2020 WTO
salary survey and dependency allowances,
updates from the chair of the WTO Pension
Plan management board and a report on the
status of the implementation of the external
audit recommendations. It also reviewed
an update on the WTO medical insurance
plan and After Service Health Insurance,
the 2018 and 2019 annual report on the
grading structure in the WTO Secretariat,
the annual strategic facilities plan, the report
of the Office of Internal Oversight for
2019-20, the annual report on diversity
in the WTO Secretariat for 2019 and an
update on WTO Secretariat training in
standards of conduct.
The Committee took note of outstanding
contributions from WTO members and
observers and invited the General Council
to urge those under administrative measures
to liquidate their arrears.

Background
The Committee on Budget,
Finance and Administration
monitors the WTO’s budgetary
and financial matters. It
considers issues concerning
human resources management,
hears progress reports on the
WTO pension plan and deals
with financial and administrative
matters concerning the WTO
Secretariat. The Committee
reports to the General Council.

200

The WTO Secretariat presented the WTO
2019 Financial Performance Report. The
Committee proposed that the General
Council approve the transfers between
budgetary sections outlined in the report.
The external auditors presented their report
for 2019 and the Committee recommended
that the General Council approve the 2019
WTO audited financial statements.
The Office of Internal Oversight
presented its report on internal audit
activities for 2019-20 and a report on
the review of Appellate Body members’
and panellists’ fees.

The Committee recommended the General
Council approve that the accumulated
budgetary surplus, as at 31 December 2019,
be transferred to the Working Capital Fund,
which can be used to cover short-term
cash shortages.
The Committee discussed other topics,
such as coherence in the establishment and
management of WTO trust funds, enhancing
strategic planning and horizontal coordination
in the WTO, enhancing output reporting and
the planned update of the online documents
platform. This new version of the platform will
be a secure and intuitive application that helps

users easily find the information they need.
Preparatory work for implementation of the
project began in early 2021.
WTO budget 2021

The WTO derives its income from annual
contributions from its 164 members (see
Table 3) and miscellaneous income. These
contributions are based on a formula that
takes into account each member’s share of
international trade. Miscellaneous income
mainly consists of contributions from
observer countries, income from the sale of
publications and rental of meeting rooms.

The WTO derives
its income from
annual contributions
from its
164 members.

How the WTO is structured
	The WTO’s top-level decision-making
body is the Ministerial Conference,
which usually meets every two years.

At the next level, the Goods Council, Services
Council and Intellectual Property (TRIPS)
Council report to the General Council.
Numerous specialized committees, working
groups and working parties deal with the
individual agreements and other areas such
as the environment, development, membership
applications and regional trade agreements.

B

elow this is the General Council
(normally ambassadors and heads of
delegation in Geneva, and sometimes
officials sent from members’ capitals), which
meets several times a year in the Geneva
headquarters. The General Council also
meets as the Trade Policy Review Body
and the Dispute Settlement Body.

All WTO members may participate in all
councils and committees, with the exceptions
of the Appellate Body, Dispute Settlement
panels and plurilateral committees.

0 is zero or became zero due to rounding.
Billion means one thousand million.
Minor discrepancies between constituent figures and totals are due to rounding.
Unless otherwise indicated, (i) all value figures are expressed in US dollars; (ii) trade figures include the intra-trade of free trade areas, customs unions,
regional and other country groupings.
Note This report covers the WTO’s activities in 2020 and early 2021. The word “country” is frequently used to describe WTO members whereas
a few members are officially “customs territories”, and not necessarily countries in the usual sense of the word.
