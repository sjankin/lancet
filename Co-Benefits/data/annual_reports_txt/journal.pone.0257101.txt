                                                        The increasing global attention to the need to step up adaptation action has paralleled grow-

                                                    ing engagement by international organizations (IOs) with the issue. A notable trend in global
                                                    governance is that non-climate IOs such as the World Bank (WB) and the World Health Orga-
                                                    nization (WHO) are increasingly engaging with adaptation. However, engaging with adapta-
                                                    tion might crowd out scarce resources that IOs require to pursue their core mandates. And,
                                                    adaptation funding is scarce: A recent study on climate-related investments (private, public,
                                                    and multilateral) shows that in 2017–18 the support for adaptation only slightly exceeded 5
                                                    percent of total global climate finance [4]. Funding is, thus, no obvious incentive to engage
                                                    with adaptation. Why are non-climate IOs engaging in issue expansion to address adaptation
                                                    challenges?
                                                        Understanding this puzzle is important given that the actions of IOs matter for local,
                                                    national, and international adaptation outcomes. In general, IOs adopt policies, provide aid,
                                                    promote rules and norms, act as policy advisors, contribute to setting the domestic political
                                                    agenda, and ignite debates with the aim of enhancing public benefit [5–7]. In the area of adap-
                                                    tation, IOs carry out such important roles as well, in particular by funding adaptation-related
                                                    projects and setting guidelines for local and national adaptation activities [8]. For instance, the
                                                    United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) has played an important role in supporting
                                                    national adaptation planning in developing countries [9]. A first step is to better understand
                                                    how and to what extent IOs engage in adaptation governance.
                                                        The social science literature on global climate governance is large and burgeoning. It mainly
                                                    deals with the topic of climate change mitigation and the UNFCCC [10–12]. Within this litera-
                                                    ture, an emerging strand of research has begun to foreground adaptation, mapping global
                                                    adaptation governance activities and evaluating how and when these activities are effective and
                                                    democratic [13–15]. However, the overwhelming majority of studies on adaptation gover-
                                                    nance have analyzed local or national adaptation, and not global processes [8, 10], and have
                                                    mainly relied on case studies of individual political processes, issue areas, or IOs.
                                                        Thus, most social science literature on adaptation has been mainly preoccupied with politi-
                                                    cal responses at the local and national level [16–18], for example pertaining to Nationally
                                                    Determined Contributions submitted to the UNFCCC [19]. Although several IOs have defined
                                                    the concept of adaptation in relation to their mandates [14, 20], the population of global actors
                                                    involved in adaptation governance and the degree and determinants of their engagements
                                                    remain unclear, which hampers the interdisciplinary study of adaptation in the social sciences
                                                    [8].
                                                        An important challenge in this research has been to define and measure adaptation [21].
                                                    The ambiguity of the concept as a political problem has made it challenging to evaluate the lev-
                                                    els, patterns, and effectiveness of different adaptation responses [22]. As adaptation has been
                                                    typically seen as a localized issue, the concept and its measurement are even more contested
                                                    and ambiguous at the global level [23], and definitions of adaptation vary across issue areas.
                                                    To systematically compare IO engagements with adaptation across issue areas and over time,

                                           we conceive of adaptation engagement as a set of activities, including decisions and processes,
                                           aimed at reducing the adverse impacts of climate change [24, 25]. In order to qualify as an
                                           engagement with adaptation, IOs must explicitly state that an activity is aimed at counteracting
                                           the adverse impacts of climate change, but it does not necessarily have to explicitly refer to the
                                           notion of adaptation.
                                               Discussing the literature on IOs, it has focused on the structures, activities, and perfor-
                                           mance of IOs across a large number of issue areas, including climate change. In this large liter-
                                           ature, the body of work on issue expansion is particularly relevant. In this tradition, scholars
                                           are interested in how, why, and to what extent IOs move beyond their core mandates and
                                           become active in new issue areas [5, 6, 26, 27]. Several studies have shown how IOs have
                                           expanded their core mandates to address adaptation challenges. The WHO has moved beyond
                                           its core mandate in public health to also address climate-related health risks [28]. The Interna-
                                           tional Organization for Migration (IOM) has expanded its core mandate by making climate-
                                           induced migration a priority in recent years [14]. The United Nations Security Council
                                           (UNSC) has related to climate risks in some of its peace-keeping operations and official state-
                                           ments [29]. The European Union (EU) has been shown to be a frontrunner in linking energy
                                           and climate change [30, 31]. However, scholars have yet to provide a large-scale mapping of
                                           engagement with adaptation; existing datasets on IOs’ climate governance are typically limited
                                           to energy and environmental affairs [32–34]. In the most encompassing assessment of IOs’
                                           policy scope so far, the 29 issue areas covered do not include adaptation [35]. In sum, the
                                           absence of suitable data has hampered progress in understanding to what extent, how, why,
                                           and with what consequences non-climate IOs engage with adaptation.
                                               We have therefore developed a dataset at the IO-year level including measures of IOs’
                                           engagement with adaptation, which enables us to map adaptation governance across IOs,
                                           across issue areas, and over time. We refer to IO engagement as the degree to which IOs gov-
                                           ern adaptation in the context of their core mandates by organizing different activities, such as
                                           publishing scientific case studies and implementing adaptation programs. The dataset includes
                                           several measures as well as a composite index of IOs’ adaptation engagement, thereby enabling
                                           systematic assessments of how, to what extent, why, and with what consequences non-climate
                                           IOs engage in adaptation governance.
                                               More specifically, the aim of this article is to introduce a novel dataset on the engagement
                                           of 30 IOs with adaptation from 1990 to 2017, and map IOs’ adaptation engagement compara-

                                           the IO level. We use these data to map these organizations’ engagement with adaptation, show-

                                           zles that can be addressed using the dataset. Taken together, this dataset can be used to
                                           examine issue expansion among IOs in the area of climate change, and to compare, describe,
                                           and explain adaptation activities across and within IOs and over time.

                                           Materials and methods
                                           In this section, we lay out the overarching research design, present the rationale for selecting
                                           IOs, issue areas, and the time period, and discuss the data generation process as well as the
                                           measurement of IOs’ adaptation engagement.

                                           Design of the dataset
                                           The design of the dataset was guided by three main choices. The first pertains to the inclusion
                                           of a large number of IOs. We selected 30 IOs for which we conducted a qualitative textual

                                           analysis of these IOs’ annual reports during the period 1990–2017. As noted, existing research
                                           has largely focused on the UNFCCC. Little is known about non-climate IOs, especially the
                                           regional ones, such as the Pacific Islands Forum (PIF) or the East African Community (EAC),
                                           both of which have engaged with climate adaptation in various ways. We have thus con-
                                           structed the dataset by including a large number of IOs from multiple issue areas and all world
                                           regions. This design choice enables a comparative inquiry and allows us to provide a broad
                                           understanding of IOs’ engagement with adaptation.
                                               The second choice concerns the longitudinal character of the dataset. The ways in which
                                           IOs have responded to adaptation are mostly studied with a view to the 2010s [14], and a sys-
                                           tematic longitudinal analysis is still lacking. We settled for the time period 1990–2017 in order
                                           to capture early developments in adaptation engagement, which paralleled the negotiations
                                           leading up to the inception of the UNFCCC initiated in 1990. We consider this time period to
                                           be sufficiently long to capture long-term developments.
                                               Third, we relied on IO annual reports which provide useful information about IOs’ adapta-
                                           tion engagements. Through annual reports, IOs take stock of their activities in the preceding
                                           year. Crucially, the advantage with this data source is that it allows us to compare the content
                                           of these texts across different IOs, due to their similar function and structure. Formal rules and
                                           other outputs, such as communique´s or guidelines issued by IOs are often not functionally
                                           equivalent and therefore not comparable. For instance, UNSC formal statements are not com-
                                           parable to formal statements by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
                                           (UNHCR), as the former reflect the official stance of the Council adopted at a Council meeting
                                           and issued as an official document, whereas the latter represent the stance of the Higher Com-
                                           missioner and not formally adopted decisions.
                                               A known challenge when using annual reports is that these are official documents contain-
                                           ing selective and strategic information, in part used to legitimate the IOs’ own actions [36, 37].
                                           Early engagement before 2007 may be underreported, as adaptation has only after the IPCC
                                           report in 2007 [2] been recognized as an issue that needs integrating in different issue areas
                                           [8]. Therefore, we opted for a broad approach by coding all activities that mentioned activities
                                           addressing climate risks as adaptation engagement, and not only those activities that explicitly
                                           used the adaptation label. An additional challenge is that documents were not available in all
                                           cases (S3 Table in S1 File), which is important to note to interpret average engagement levels
                                           analyzed in this article. Taken together, analyzing annual reports enables a systematic compar-
                                           ison of adaptation engagement over time. Next, we discuss the rationale behind the selection
                                           of IOs and issue areas.


                                           Selection of international organizations
                                           The Correlates of War dataset includes 533 IOs [38] whereas the Yearbook of International
                                           Organizations encompasses as many as 7,722 IOs, which includes non-governmental and
                                           hybrid institutions [39]. Here we define IOs on the basis of five criteria. First, IOs are intergov-
                                           ernmental and engage in decision-making, have permanent headquarters, and have a written
                                           constitution or construction. Second, an IO has a formal bureaucratic structure (i.e., a legisla-
                                           tive body, execution and administration). For instance, the Arctic Council’s secretariat became
                                           operational only in 2013, which is why we excluded the organization from the sample. Third,
                                           an IO has stable state membership [40] and, fourth, has been active during the period 1990–
                                           2017. Fifth, organizations with predecessors, such as The Africa Rice Center, formerly known
                                           as the West Africa Rice Development Association (WARDA), are treated as one entity.
                                               The sample of IOs was created in three steps. In a first step, we limited the sample to non-
                                           climate IOs. As we are interested in issue expansion, the dataset includes IOs whose founding

                                           treaties or legal frameworks do not include climate change. For example, we excluded the
                                           UNFCCC whose core mandate encompasses adaptation. The second step consisted of limiting
                                           the sample further to IOs in issue areas for which adaptation is relevant. In order to identify
                                           the relevant issue areas, we conducted careful desk research by engaging with the case study lit-
                                           erature on adaptation [10, 41, 42]. We identified nine broad issue areas: development, disaster
                                           risk management, food and agriculture, global development banking, health, migration, peace
                                           and security, regional cooperation, and trade. Issue areas such as finance and taxation were
                                           excluded. Third, we selected the major IOs in each issue area. For example, in the area of
                                           health, we included the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and WHO but excluded
                                           the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO). United Nations (UN) specialized agencies
                                           and offices were included in the sample if they enjoy autonomy over their operations and bud-
                                           getary decisions, and have separate membership criteria although some have reporting
                                           requirements to the UN General Assembly.
                                              The final sample consists of major IOs with mandates in areas relevant for adaptation,
                                           whereby IOs varyingly engage in adaptation, ranging from no engagement to very high levels
                                           of engagement. Table 1 shows that this sample of 30 IOs spans all world regions—Africa, Asia,
                                           the Americas, Europe, and organizations with global membership—with core mandates in the
                                           nine issue areas mentioned earlier. The world region that is best represented is the global level
                                           (15 IOs), followed by the African region (6 IOs), the Asian region (4 IOs), the European region
                                           (3 IOs), and the North and South American regions (2 IOs).
                                              We do not claim that this sample is strictly representative for the full population of IOs.
                                           One should therefore be cautious about generalizing results beyond these IOs and issue areas.
                                           However, the crucial advantage of our selection procedure is that it allows us to explore pat-
                                           terns and conditions for adaptation engagement in organizations with varying characteristics,
                                           which are often expected to shape issue expansion, such as authority [40]. At the same time,
                                           the selected IOs are key governing organizations within their respective policy domains,

                                           In total, we analyzed 697 annual reports produced by 30 IOs for the period 1990–2017. The
                                           data was collected in three stages. First, two researchers compiled these annual reports. Second,
                                           where annual reports were not available online, IOs were directly contacted to request missing
                                           documents. The third stage encompassed the coding of the reports. Initially, the keywords “cli-
                                           mate”, “climatic”, “climate risks”, and “adaptation” were used to detect relevant paragraphs
                                           within each report. Although IOs reported on both mitigation- and adaptation-related climate
                                           activities, we included only activities geared toward adaptation given the research gap outlined
                                           above.
                                               During the coding process, two independent coders ran a keyword search for “climate” and
                                           “climate change”. Subsequently, explicit mentions of adaptation activities were included in the
                                           dataset, which are operationalized as activities directed at the social, security, energy and eco-
                                           nomic impacts of a changing climate. The result of this process is the coding of 2,146 adapta-
                                           tion activities that fall into seven distinct categories of governance responses generated
                                           inductively (Table 2): statements, events, frameworks, funds, operational activities, reports,
                                           and institutional change.
                                               “Statements” are measures of instances of official communication by IO secretariats, such
                                           as the UN Security Council’s presidential statement on effects of climate change and conflict
                                           prevention [43]. “Events” refer to any public events, for instance UNHCR’s side events at
                                           UNFCCC conferences, and private gatherings, such as Executive Committee meetings. The
                                           category “framework” encompasses strategy and framework documents laying out policy or
                                           an action plan for how to respond to adaption. The category “funds” captures the creation of
                                           funds to adaptation or the pooling of financial resources to address adaptation challenges.
                                           “Operational” activities encompass programs, such as the World Bank’s 2017 data collection
                                           initiative on building resilience to climate change in six countries [44], and projects, such as
                                           the European Commission’s projects on energy infrastructure [45]. The category “reports”
                                           refers to IOs’ publishing results of scientific enquiries, country case studies for instance
                                           WHO’s climate impacts on health. The final category captures “institutional” change, includ-
                                           ing IOs’ structural responses to adaptation. Examples are the working group on the manage-
                                           ment and emergency response to climatic disasters established by the Association of Southeast
                                           Asian Nations (ASEAN) [46] and the Natural Capital Financing Facility set up by the EU to
                                           mobilize to generate new private investment in nature and climate adaptation [45].

                                              The coders decided if the text addressing adaptation included an IO’s governance response
                                           in one of these categories. We conducted extensive validity and reliability tests. We tested the
                                           validity of the coding scheme by applying it to various documents published in different years
                                           (1997–2017), and across IOs in pilot coding studies. In addition, we have sought to ensure reli-
                                           ability by giving two coders the task of conducting the document analysis independently from
                                           each other. In total, 35 percent of the documents were coded by both coders, and we arrived at
                                           a satisfactory level of intercoder reliability for the different items. The intercoder reliability for
                                           each category in terms of Krippendorff’s alpha is as follows: statements (0.95), events (0.81),
                                           frameworks (0.83), funds (0.84), operational activities (0.91), reports (0.87), and institutional
                                           change (0.79). These values indicate substantial agreement between the coders.
                                              The annual reports were subsequently analyzed through qualitative textual analysis. We opted
                                           for a qualitative analysis as IOs’ engagement with climate adaptation is still poorly understood [8].
                                           Despite a burgeoning comparative literature on climate adaptation at the national level [47, 48],
                                           the notion of adaptation is rather vague and defined differently in different contexts, as elaborated
                                           earlier [24]. We therefore needed to gain an in-depth understanding of the ways in which IOs
                                           communicate about adaptation in the annual reports before we were able to quantify the informa-
                                           tion. Alternative approaches, such as supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques,
                                           which are increasingly common in adaptation [49] and international relations research [50],
                                           would have performed worse. Any automated text analysis might have glossed over valuable
                                           detailed information about IO activities, for instance the degree to which adaptation challenges
                                           were prioritized in a specific project. Thus, although the qualitative analysis of 697 official docu-
                                           ments was time consuming, it provided much needed in-depth insight into IOs’ activities.
                                              Where the annual reports lacked sufficient information for a particular activity, additional
                                           documents were consulted, including project descriptions, briefings, treaty provisions, and
                                           policy guidelines. We use this additional material only when a particular adaptation activity is
                                           included in the annual report but is insufficiently elaborated upon. As the additional material
                                           was used only to complement the existing information in annual reports, this practice does
                                           not compromise the comparability of the IO annual reports.
                                              The outcome is a unique dataset of seven categories of adaptation responses of 30 IOs for
                                           each year during the period 1990–2017. Next, we discuss how we created the index of IO
                                           engagement with adaptation on the basis of these data.


                                           Measuring adaptation engagement
                                           Previous research provides useful insights for how to measure adaptation at the national level
                                           [17, 51, 52]. At the global level, Hall (2016) focuses on policy, rhetorical, structural and opera-
                                           tional change to study mandate expansion to integrate adaptation [53]. Persson (2019) empha-
                                           sizes the importance of the scale of the adaptation problem, level of governance, and actors
                                           involved, when assessing global adaptation governance [8]. Taken together, these studies are
                                           evidence that IO engagement is a complex and multi-dimensional concept. We therefore pro-
                                           pose a measure that takes into account this complexity while at the same time lending itself to
                                           making inference to the overall degree of adaptation engagement of an IO.
                                              This measure is a composite index with four dimensions or variables coded for each adapta-
                                           tion activity: prioritization, time horizon, funding, and staffing. These dimensions are men-
                                           tioned as central aspects of organizational ambition and commitment in the literatures on
                                           mainstreaming [54], policy integration [55], interaction management [56], and IOs’ own
                                           assessments of their commitments to climate adaptation [57].
                                              Table 3 illustrates how each of the four dimensions were coded by using the example of
                                           a specific adaptation activity. The first dimension, prioritization, captures the relative

                                                         reported activity [58] and S1 Table in S1 File). An activity was assigned the value of “pri-
                                                         mary priority” (= 1) if adaptation is the main focus of that activity. Secondary priority (=
                                                         0.5) means that adaptation is a subsidiary topic in an activity. For instance, if a specific
                                                         report features climate change impacts on human health as the main topic, it is coded as
                                                         “primary priority” on the prioritization dimension. By contrast, a specific mitigation proj-
                                                         ect including a minor adaptation component is an example of a “secondary priority”. By
                                                         providing information on the extent or depth of adaptation engagement, the prioritization
                                                         dimension in part address the issue that an IO may merely relabel an existing activity as
                                                         adaptation but without actually addressing it.
                                                             The second dimension, time horizon, captures the temporal length of an adaptation
                                                         activity. The variable is coded 0.5 for one-shot engagements with adaptation, 1 for
                                                         medium-term responses (up to 5 years), and 1.5 for responses lasting longer than 5 years.
                                                         Longer-term activities are interpreted as greater commitment to climate adaptation (S2

                                                         monly referred to in institutional briefings as activities that demonstrate organizational
                                                         commitment to climate change mitigation and adaptation [59]. The amount of funds and staff
                                                         allocated to climate adaptation is partly a function of an IO’s total resources, but fund alloca-
                                                         tions also indicate how willing an IO is to engage with the issue. The funding variable captures
                                                         whether IOs create or pool funds for an activity (= 1, 0 if otherwise). Staffing refers to whether
                                                         an IO recruits or assigns staff to an adaptation-related activity (= 1, 0 if otherwise). Thus, both
                                                         funding and staffing are binary measures, taking a value of 1 if fund creation or staffing is pres-
                                                         ent and 0 if not (see S1 File for more details).
                                                             Each of these adaptation-related activities were weighted–or multiplied–by the scores for
                                                         these four dimensions (weighting scores). Then the activities were summed up for each IO in
                                                         each year, which yields a specific score for each IO in each year.
                                                             Based on these scores for each IO in each year, we calculate the IO Engagement Index in
                                                         four steps. First, we normalized each variable x in the index to bring the values in each variable
                                                         to the same range (prioritization, time horizon, funding and staffing). This normalization
                                                         takes the generic form:

                                                                                                             �           xit
                                                                                                       let         ¼                                                            ð1Þ
                                                                                                             xit       maxðxit Þ

                                                         for every i and t, where i refers to an IO and t to a year in the dataset. After normalizing each
                                                         of the four variables on the basis of this formula, we created the additive index by using the

                                           normalized variables. The formula for this second step is as follows:
                                                                      �                        �                 �                �
                                                                                     þ                    þ                þ                       ð2Þ

                                              In a third step, we normalized the overarching index by dividing the index value of an IO in
                                           a given year by the maximum index value across all years.
                                                                                 �              indexit
                                                                                          ¼                                                        ð3Þ
                                                                               index it       maxðindexit Þ

                                              In a fourth and final step, all index scores were multiplied by 100, resulting in an index
                                           ranging from 0 (no engagement) to 100 (maximum engagement).
                                              This index correlates highly with a simple additive index of the four components (prioriti-
                                           zation, time horizon, funding and staffing) (r = 0.89). By contrast, the IO Engagement Index is
                                           adjusted to have a standard minimum and maximum value. The internal reliability of the
                                           index dimensions has a Cronbach’s alpha of 0.79, which indicates that the four dimensions
                                           consistently measure the IO adaptation engagement.
                                              To explore the validity of the index, we explored the possibility that IOs with larger budgets
                                           that might engage more frequently in funding-related and potentially other activities might
                                           also score higher on the index. To this end, we examined the relationship between IO annual
                                           revenues and IOs’ adaptation engagement, but find little evidence for this. The correlation
                                           between IO annual revenue in million United States dollar (USD), derived from the finance
                                           and budget statistics of the UN System Chief Executives Board for Coordination [60], and the
                                           Adaptation Engagement Index is quite weak (r = 0.2527; N = 455), which we illustrate in S1
                                           Fig in S1 File. To illustrate, in 2017 the International Fund for Agricultural Development
                                           (IFAD) and UNHCR scored similarly on the index (22.37 and 21.87, respectively) but had very
                                           different revenue levels (418.85 and 4226.52 million USD, respectively). To completely rule
                                           out a potential bias toward larger organizations on the Adaptation Engagement Index, future
                                           studies could expand the dataset to include all IO activities, which would allow for examining
                                           the proportion of the total number of adaptation activities to the total number of IO activities.
                                           Taken together, our evidence does not suggest that the Adaptation Engagement Index is biased
                                           toward IOs with larger budgets.


                                           Measuring framings of adaptation
                                           In addition to measuring adaptation engagement, we abductively identified four ways in
                                           which IOs frame adaptation. Existing framings refer to the ways in which IOs describe the neg-
                                           ative impacts of the climate change and who is subject to these impacts. In short, these fram-
                                           ings capture how IOs describe adaptation problems.
                                               We identified different framings through a qualitative content analysis of how adaptation
                                           activities were phrased in IO annual reports. The four framing types include (a) economic fram-
                                           ing (b) human security framing, (c) state security framing and (d) energy security framing of cli-
                                           mate adaptation. Economic framings refer to the economic implications of climate change, for
                                           example on consumption, production or trade. Human security framings often refer to vulnera-
                                           bility or IOs’ humanitarian activities to alleviate the adverse impacts of climate change on
                                           humans, for example in food security programmes. State security framings of adaptation imply
                                           that IOs refer to climate impacts as threats to national security, for instance small islands states
                                           whose security is threatened by rising sea levels. Lastly, energy security framings of adaptation
                                           occur when IOs focus on the disruptions in energy supply chains due to climate change.

                                            Results
                                            During the period 1990–2017, most of the 2,146 adaptation-related activities of IOs were oper-
                                            ational—e.g., on-the-ground projects and country operations (37.27% of all adaptation-related
                                            actions identified, N = 800 of N = 2,146). The second most frequent category is events, such as
                                            conferences and workshops organized by IOs (22.50%, N = 483). The publication of reports
                                            amounts to 13.09% (N = 281) of adaptation activities, followed by the creation of funds 11.88%
                                            (N = 255) and frameworks 10.76% (N = 231). Institutional change, for example brought about
                                            by establishing departments tasked with adaptation, and setting up task forces as well as work-
                                            ing groups, amount to 3.22% (N = 69). Specific declarations and statements merely make up
                                            1.26% (N = 27) of all adaptation-related actions.
                                                The dataset demonstrates that IOs have increasingly engaged with climate adaptation in
                                            recent decades. Fig 1 displays the composite IO Engagement Index over time. There is a strong
                                            increase in the adaptation engagement of IOs over the 27-year period, evidenced in an increase
                                            in the average score of the index from 0.27 out of 100 in 1990 to 24.63 in 2017. The most nota-
                                            ble pattern is the steep increase in 2007 and 2008. While the average engagement was 1.37 in
                                            2006, it increased to 11.85 in 2007, and to 20.84 in 2008, displaying a structural break during
                                            this time span, after which IO engagement with adaptation has fluctuated.
                                                Low levels of IO engagement with adaptation from 1990 to 2007 can be attributed to the
                                            politics of climate change during the 1990s, where global policy focused mostly on mitigation.
                                            This changed significantly especially in 2007 when the fourth IPCC report was released and
                                            the Bali Action Plan was adopted, which outlined both adaptation and mitigation as important
                                            pillars of the UNFCCC’s mission [61]. To be sure, some IOs had addressed adaptation even
                                            before 2007. The WHO’s study on the climate impacts on health in 1990 is a case in point [62].
                                            However, this was a relatively marginal topic in a specific unit in the organization at the time,
                                            and no information was included in the annual reports [13].

                                               This pattern of IO engagement begs important questions about how the shares of specific
                                           adaptation activities have developed over time (Fig 2). The 1990–1995 period is characterized
                                           by a relatively high share of events and conferences in proportion to all activities. After 2001,
                                           local projects and programs began to constitute the majority of how IOs have engaged with
                                           adaptation, e.g., the World Bank’s Agricultural Adaptation program for agricultural develop-
                                           ment and adaptation to climate change [63]. Fund creation activities were mainly established
                                           during the period 1996–2000 and proliferated after 2001. A typical example of fund creation is
                                           the ASEAN-India Green Fund established in 2010 to support pilot projects of adaptation to
                                           and mitigation of climate change [64]. The publication of scientific reports followed a similar
                                           trajectory. WHO’s continuous reporting on the health impacts of climate change features
                                           prominently in that category. In the final period 2011–2017, we see comparatively little change
                                           in the shares of adaptation activities when compared to the preceding time period.
                                               IOs have defined adaptation-related challenges differently over time (Fig 3). As set forth
                                           above, there are four main framings of climate adaptation that are often linked to the rationale
                                           as to why an IO responded to climate risks. Between 1990 and 1995, energy and state security
                                           framings of climate adaptation were most common. Examples are the European Commission’s
                                           adoption of a Green Paper on the climate change’s effects on the security of energy supply
                                           [65]. After 1996, framings have diversified. To illustrate, the African Union promoted several
                                           framings of climate risks, focusing on the potential repercussions of climate change on the
                                           global economy and on human security.
                                               After 2001 a human security framing of climate risks became predominant. Illustrations of
                                           this type of framing are AU’s and IOM’s attempts to put the link between migration and cli-
                                           mate change on the global agenda by highlighting the human security risks [66]. Even IOs that
                                           do normally not place climate risks high on their agenda, such as, for instance, trade organiza-
                                           tions, adopted a human security framing during this period. This framing was, for instance,

                                           clearly adopted in a roundtable organized by the World Trade Organization (WTO) that
                                           focused on food security [67].
                                              Previous comparative case studies in global climate governance have shown that IO behav-
                                           ior in addressing new problems varies across issue areas [11, 68]. Our data corroborates this
                                           assessment. Fig 4 shows the patterns of IO engagement across 9 issue areas, where the index
                                           scores represent the mean of adaptation engagement in each issue area. These average scores
                                           for the period 1990–2017 suggest that IOs in disaster risk management have most frequently
                                           engaged with adaptation, followed by global development banks (Asian Development Bank
                                           (ADB), European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), Inter-American Devel-
                                           opment Bank (IADB), World Bank), migration (UNHCR, IOM), health (WHO and UNFPA)
                                           and the regional cooperation IOs (e.g., EU, ASEAN, AU). The lowest levels of engagement
                                           were found in peace and security (UN Security Council, North Atlantic Treaty Organisation
                                           (NATO) and Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE)) as well as trade
                                           (WTO).
                                              Engagement with adaptation also varies across IOs when we categorize the sample based on
                                           the geographical region (Fig 5). There is great variation before and after 2007, which is why we
                                           present the data divided into these two time periods. While IOs in the Americas (IADB and
                                           Organization of American States) were the early starters in adaptation governance in the
                                           1990–2006 period, IOs in Asia and Europe were most engaged during 2007–2017 (Fig 5).
                                              Next, we examine the differences in adaptation engagement across individual IOs. Fig 6
                                           ranks IOs by depicting their average scores in the IO Engagement Index for the 1990–2017
                                           period. UNISDR tops the list, scoring 37.7 out of 100 on the index, followed by WHO, IFAD,
                                           ADB, African Development Bank, United Nations Children’s Emergency Fund (UNICEF),
                                           IADB and EU, which all have a history of high adaptation engagement. The EU has most often
                                           engaged in adaptation in every year until 2001, and in 2014 the EU has the highest engagement
                                           score, 100 out of 100. Specialized IOs, such as UNICEF and IOM, have engaged with

                                           EAC. WTO and the peace and security IOs, such as NATO, OSCE and UNSC, score lowest in
                                           comparison to other IOs.
                                              Fig 6 showcases how our comparative and broad selection of non-climate IOs enabled
                                           nuanced conclusions about IOs’ adaptation engagement. In fact, some of the most engaged
                                           IOs–WHO, UNISDR, IFAD, ADB–have attracted minimal scholarly attention from global
                                           adaptation governance scholars. This ranking suggests that focusing only on the climate IOs or
                                           on the European organizations would lead to biased conclusions and miss important variation
                                           in IO adaptation engagement.

                                              In sum, our analysis has revealed patterns of IO adaptation engagement that beg important
                                           questions about their drivers and consequences. Our dataset could be fruitfully matched to
                                           other existing datasets at the IO-year level and used to select cases for the purpose of historical
                                           or comparative inquiries of specific IOs or political processes.


                                           Conclusion
                                           In this article, we have presented a novel dataset and mapped the yearly engagement of 30 IOs
                                           with climate change adaptation during the period 1990–2017. We wish to highlight two key
                                           insights. First, the evidence in this dataset suggests that IOs in nine different non-climate issue
                                           areas have expanded their mandates over past decades, increasingly engaging with adaptation.
                                           This is a development that spans all observed issue areas and world regions. Second, there is
                                           considerable variation in adaptation engagement across IOs, across issue areas, across geo-
                                           graphical regions, and over time. Importantly, IOs in disaster risk management and develop-
                                           ment banking are most engaged, and IOs in trade and security least. European organizations
                                           and IOs in the Americas are most engaged, and global as well as African organizations least.
                                           Regarding the variation over time, we have seen a surge in adaptation engagement in 2007
                                           after the 2007 IPCC report on adaptation and the Bali Action Plan.
                                               There are three broader implications for the social scientific study of adaptation. To begin
                                           with, our evidence is in line with previous research suggesting that adaptation is integrated in
                                           different issue areas [13, 14, 29], but provides a more nuanced picture of the patterns of this
                                           variation. Starting from this assessment, future research could usefully analyze the patterns,
                                           causes, and consequences of IO-specific engagement with adaptation across different sectors
                                           of society, in conjunction with increasing cross-border flows and risks. Future work could also
                                           extend the analysis of international adaptation engagement to other types of organizations

                                               Moreover, the evidence provided here can be used for selecting in-depth studies of individ-
                                           ual IOs or specific adaptation-related processes and situate those in broader patterns of IO
                                           adaptation engagement. Our analysis yields puzzles that may be usefully addressed in future
                                           comparative research on adaptation, which is still scant [69]. For example, why do the ASEAN
                                           and ADB engage varyingly with adaptation, although they are located in the same region and
                                           their members face similar adaptation challenges? ADB is one of the early adapters and
                                           ASEAN an organization engaging relatively late with adaptation–why? Our data thus enables
                                           future qualitative comparative case studies of specific IOs over time, or comparative case stud-
                                           ies of IOs within or across issue areas, seeking to explain variation in engagement.
                                               Finally, the dataset could be used to link to existing large-n data on IOs. This could include
                                           other aid data channeled through IOs, such as multilateral development or disaster aid, for
                                           example available through the OECD’s DAC database, to ascertain if adaptation engagement is
                                           supported by or correlated with specific aid flows [70]. Other examples include datasets on IO
                                           authority to examine whether IO authority may be a driver of IO adaptation engagement [71].
                                           Yet other studies could usefully link IOs’ varying engagement with adaptation to IO members’
                                           vulnerability and adaptive capacity, for example by using vulnerability indices such as the
                                           Notre Dame Global Adaptation Initiative (ND-GAIN) or hazard severity measures available in
                                           the Emergency Events Database (EM-DAT) and from meteorological re-analyses [72]. Such
                                           extended datasets would enable the comparative study of the causes and consequences of adap-
                                           tation engagement by IOs across countries, across issue areas, and over time. These issues will
                                           become increasingly important to understand as climate-related risks for humans and states
                                           are becoming more pressing.
