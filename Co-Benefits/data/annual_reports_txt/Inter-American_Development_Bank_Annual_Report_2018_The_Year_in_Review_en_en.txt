Message from
the President


In 2018, the world economy continued to grow un-
evenly as both advanced nations and developing
economies evolved at different paces. Latin Amer-
ica and the Caribbean maintained a slow recovery,
growing 1.2%, much lower than the 2.2% expected
for 2019.
    Beyond the macroeconomic situation, intra-
regional migration gained increasing visibility in
2018. Migration stems from a complex combination
of economic, political, climatic and environmental
factors that have evolved continuously in recent
years. Many of our countries have gone from having many of their citizens
move abroad to hosting an influx of immigrants, in the process showing em-
pathy and generosity to their neighbors. However, when migration is sudden
and massive, it can have adverse consequences in host countries.
    As a result, several of the IDB’s member countries have requested support
to strengthen their migration systems and invest in services including migrant
identification, health, education, basic sanitation and economic inclusion for
migrants and their host communities. The IDB has proposed mobilizing funds
to finance this multisectoral agenda and mitigate the budget impacts in host
countries.
    Migration is just one of the public policy priorities that are evolving in our
countries. For instance, an update of the IDB’s Institutional Strategy, which
is still underway, reflects interest in accelerating the adoption of information
technologies and preparing young people for the demands of tomorrow’s
job markets. It also recognizes the urgent need to create ecosystems that
harness our youth’s innovative and entrepreneurial spirit by offering them
better access to seed capital, angel investors and technical advice.
    We must also respond to our societies’ longstanding demand for trans-
parent and effective public management. Corruption and impunity corrode
the credibility of our institutions and the legitimacy of our democracies. Con-
sequently, promoting transparency and integrity is crucial to encouraging

    public confidence in the rule of law and its institutions, to protecting economic
    stability, boosting growth and ensuring the safety of our citizens.
       We delivered solid results in 2018. The Bank approved 96 sovereign guaran-
    teed loans for $13.5 billion in financing and disbursed more than $9.9 billion. As
    for the private sector and activities without sovereign guarantees, I am pleased
    to report that IDB Invest approved more than $4 billion in operations. With more
    than $17 billion in total approvals, the IDB Group remained the leading source of
    multilateral financing for Latin America and the Caribbean.
       This would not have been possible without the dedication of everyone related
    to the IDB Group. Thanks to their work and the leadership of our Board of Exec-
    utive Directors, I can affirm that our evolution is favorable and that our numbers
    are satisfactory.
       Undoubtedly, these achievements put us in a privileged position to celebrate
    the Bank’s 60th anniversary in 2019.

Operational Summary




1
    Loan Approvals

    In 2018, the Bank approved 96 sovereign guaranteed loan projects for $13.5
    billion in total financing. The sovereign guaranteed loan approval program
    included 76 investment projects and one partial credit guarantee for a
    subtotal of $8.5 billion and 18 policy-based projects for $4.6 billion, as well
    as $100 million in special financing for development in Barbados. In addition,
    the Bank approved $250 million in extra funding for a project supporting the
    Metro in Quito.1

       The investment projects included nine operations for $1.6 billion under
    conditional credit lines for investment projects (CCLIPs) and supplementary
    financing for $7 million. The Bank also approved a $490 million loan guaran-
    tee facility for Argentina as part of its broader investment project approval
    program.
       Of the 18 policy-based projects, three were multiple-tranches operations
    for $412 million, one was a hybrid project for $100 million, and 14 were
    programmatic loans for a total of $4.1 billion. Of the programmatic loans, 10
    corresponded to early-stage operations, for a total of $2.7 billion, and four
    were for subsequent-stage projects totaling $1.4 billion.
       The total cost of projects financed under the sovereign guaranteed loan
    approval program was $14.8 billion. That includes $12.5 billion2 of loans from
    the Bank’s Ordinary Capital (OC), four projects under the IDB Grant Facility
    for $423 million, $272 million from funds under the Bank’s management
    and $1.6 billion from other sources and local contributions. The Bank also
    approved $385 million in two Contingent Credit Facilities for Natural Disaster
    Emergencies and five new CCLIPs for a total of $2.3 billion.
       In 2018, loans to small and vulnerable countries (Groups C and D), increased
    43%, from $3.8 billion in 2017 to $5.4 billion. As a result, the share of approvals

       In 2018, 117 non-sovereign guaranteed loans originated by IDB Invest were co-financed by the
    Bank, for a total of $2 billion. When this amount is added to the $13 billion in sovereign loan
    approvals, together with an additional $234 million in non-sovereign guaranteed loan approvals
    from trust funds, the Bank’s volume of approvals for the year totaled $15.2 billion in 2018.

Highlights by Sector

    Creation of the Knowledge, Innovation and Communication
    Sector

    In a world of dizzying technological change, an overabundance of free infor-
    mation and ubiquitous connectivity, successful organizations are those that
    create specialized knowledge and turn it into innovative solutions to persistent
    problems. These organizations also communicate about those solutions in
    ways that meet the specific needs of diverse individuals and groups.
        Companies and organizations that stand out in this regard—from Google
    and Salesforce to Samsung and the World Economic Forum—have become
    some of the most influential of our era. The methods and tools that they
    use to leverage knowledge, innovation and communication have transformed
    entire industries in recent years, while also foreshadowing significant changes
    in the world of development finance.
        But while many organizations claim these traits are integral to their value
    proposition, most are not yet able to manage the processes related to these
    activities in ways that efficiently deliver better results. Because of this, on May
    21, 2018, the Board of Executive Directors created the Knowledge, Innovation
    and Communication Sector (KIC) to integrate and optimize work done by the
    Office of External Relations, the Knowledge and Learning Sector (KNL) and
    the Digital Economy Initiative (DEI).
        KIC will help the IDB Group identify, create, apply and disseminate high
    quality knowledge. It will develop the related technical skills and knowhow
    of its personnel and promote an internal culture of innovation. KIC will also
    increase the size and scope of the audience that consumes the Bank’s knowl-
    edge products, strengthening its institutional branding.
        The consolidation of these activities enables KIC to offer a fully integrated
    suite of services to the IDB Group’s members, eliminating duplication and
    ensuring that a consistent set of metrics is used to measure results. It also
    allows the IDB Group to leverage its digital channels to offer segmented
    content and training to diverse audiences and to anticipate their needs
    through surveys and continuous feedback.
