     For All Who Serve
     NATO’s core responsibility is to ensure that the Alliance’s territory and populations
     remain safe, in a world where peace and security can never be taken for granted.
     Our free societies and the rules-based international order need to be backed by
     credible transatlantic defence. Since NATO was created seven decades ago, we rely
     on the personnel of Allied and partner countries’ armed forces to fulfil this mission.

     Throughout 2019, tens of thousands of men and women from Europe and North
     America served in NATO military commands, exercises, missions and operations to
     keep our nations safe, from the Mediterranean to the Arctic Sea and from the North
     Atlantic Ocean to Afghanistan. With their dedication and determination, our soldiers,
     sailors, aircrew and marines are the living example of NATO’s solidarity and values.

     We know that should the need arise, they will stand together to defend and protect
     each other and keep our nations safe. We owe them and their families deep
     gratitude for the sacrifices they make on our behalf.

  national forces on land, in the air and at sea, be it for crisis intervention or high-intensity war-fighting. At the
  Brussels Summit in 2018, Allies committed, by 2020, to having 30 mechanised battalions, 30 air squadrons
  and 30 combat vessels, ready to use within 30 days or less. The initiative is not about new forces, but
  about increasing the readiness of the forces that NATO nations already have, so that they can be made
  available to NATO for rapid reinforcement and crisis response at a time when the Alliance is facing threats
  and challenges from multiple directions. In 2019, Allies contributed all of the combat forces required for
  this initiative and are now working to build and maintain the level of readiness of these forces and organise
  them into larger formations. The NATO Readiness Initiative significantly improves the Alliance’s ability to
  reinforce any Ally and to respond rapidly to any crisis.

          NATO’s Maritime Posture
          In 2019, the Alliance invested in reinforcing its maritime posture, improving interoperability,
          increasing maritime situational awareness and enhancing collective maritime war-fighting skills
          in key areas, including anti-submarine warfare, amphibious operations and the protection of sea
          lines of communications. In 2019, NATO ships spent more than 12,500 hours patrolling the sea.




 NATO’s efforts have also focused on anticipating                                               Alliance’s awareness and understanding of security

 18           DETERRENCE, DEFENCE AND DIALOGUE
-----------------------Page 20 End-----------------------

Relations with Russia
After the end of the Cold War, NATO made considerable efforts to build a strategic partnership with Russia,
based on dialogue and practical cooperation in areas of common interest. Key milestones in the NATO-Russia
relationship included the 1997 signing of the NATO-Russia Founding Act and the 2002 creation of the NATO-
Russia Council, which to this day remains the primary forum for dialogue between NATO Allies and Russia.

In 2014, as a consequence of Russia’s illegal and illegitimate annexation of Crimea, NATO suspended all
practical cooperation with Russia. Allies decided there can be “no business as usual” until Russia returns to
compliance with international law.

NATO’s policy towards Russia is based on two pillars: defence and dialogue. This “dual-track approach” allows
the Alliance to respond to the deteriorated security environment caused by Russia with strong deterrence,
while engaging in periodic, focused and meaningful dialogue. Through its readiness for dialogue, NATO has
demonstrated that it is committed to discussing critical issues and avoiding misunderstandings, miscalculation
and unintended escalation.

In this context, NATO continues to invest in the NATO-Russia Council as a platform for dialogue to address
international security issues, while also working to increase transparency and predictability. In 2019, the NATO-
Russia Council met twice – in January and in July. On both occasions, NATO Allies and Russia addressed key
current security issues, including the ongoing conflict in Ukraine and Russia’s violation of the Intermediate-
Range Nuclear Forces Treaty.

NATO and Russia also used the NATO-Russia Council to exchange reciprocal briefings on upcoming military
exercises. NATO briefed on Exercise Dynamic Mariner 2019 and provided a follow-on briefing on Exercise Trident
Juncture 2018. In turn, Russia briefed on its exercises Tsentr 2019 and Union Shield 2019. The Head of the NATO
Military Liaison Mission in Moscow also participated in the Tsentr 2019 Distinguished Visitors Day in September
2019. NATO welcomes the continuation of these voluntary exchanges, but continues to underscore that they
cannot replace mandatory transparency Russia has committed to under the Vienna Document.

High-level meetings between NATO and Russia continued in 2019, with Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg and
Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov meeting in the margins of the Munich Security Conference in February
2019. NATO’s military leaders kept open their channels of communication with their Russian counterparts. The
Supreme Allied Commander Europe, General Tod D. Wolters, met with the Russian Chief of the General Staff,
General Valery Gerasimov, in Baku, Azerbaijan in July. The Chairman of the NATO Military Committee, Air Chief
Marshal Sir Stuart Peach, also met with General Gerasimov in Baku in November.

While remaining committed to this dual-track policy, NATO is concerned about Russia’s pattern of destabilising
behaviour across the Euro-Atlantic region and beyond. In 2019, Russia’s aggressive actions in Ukraine, including
its destabilising military behaviour and use of hybrid tactics, have continued to negatively impact international
security, while increasing unpredictability and instability.

Collective Defence, Shared Security: Listening to NATO Citizens

citizens see the transatlantic Alliance.1 The survey showed:


      Strength of the Transatlantic Bond
       81% of the public across all Allies and North Macedonia
       believe that the collaboration between North America
       and Europe on safety and security matters is important.




       Percentage of population replying “important”
           75-95%
           60-74%
           45-59%

1	   Based on surveys of 28,752 adults conducted in November 2019 by Populus in 29 NATO member countries and North Macedonia. All interviews were conducted online, except
     for North Macedonia, Albania and Montenegro where a face-to-face methodology was used due to the limited penetration of online panels in these countries. In all countries
     polled online a sample of at least 1,000 respondents per country was achieved. In face-to-face countries at least 500 individuals per country were interviewed. Quotas for
     gender, age and region were set and post-weighting was applied to ensure the samples for each country were representative of the adult population in this country. Total results
     (across all Allies polled) were weighted to the population distribution of NATO.

          Support for Membership
          Support for the Alliance is strong: most citizens back their country’s membership
          of NATO and a clear majority would vote to remain in NATO if a referendum were
          held (64%).
          The graph below shows responses to the question "if you could vote for or against your
          country's membership in NATO, how would you vote?"

  -- The need to improve verification provisions, including increased numbers of all types of verification visits

  -- The need to update the Vienna Document to reflect current practice across the different areas of its

       NATO’s Response to Russia’s Development of SSC-8 Ground-Launched
       Cruise Missile in Violation of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces
       Treaty
       Despite years of engagement by the United States and other Allies, Russia continued to develop
       and field the ground-launched, nuclear-capable SSC-8 cruise missile. In December 2018, Allies
       formally concluded that Russia was in violation of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF)
       Treaty. Allies engaged Russia to return to compliance with the INF Treaty, including at NATO-
       Russia Council sessions in January and July 2019. A situation where the United States fully abides
       by the Treaty, and Russia does not, was not sustainable. As a result, the United States decided to
       withdraw from the INF Treaty in August. This decision was fully supported by Allies.
       In response to the significant risks posed by the Russian SSC-8 cruise missiles, NATO is
       implementing a balanced, coordinated and defensive package of political and military measures
       to ensure NATO’s deterrence and defence posture remains credible and effective. These include
       adaptations to exercise programmes and conventional capabilities such as intelligence, surveillance
       and reconnaissance and missile defences. The response has also included measures to maintain
       the deterrence credibility of NATO’s dual-capable aircraft, which have the capability to undertake both
       conventional and nuclear roles. The Alliance began implementing these measures while stressing
       its firm commitment to the preservation of effective international arms control, disarmament and
       non-proliferation. NATO clarified it does not want to mirror what Russia does, it does not want a new
       arms race, and it has no intention to deploy new land-based nuclear missiles in Europe.

         spending 2% of GDP on their defence. (...) Economically, politically and militarily,
                                    together we are stronger.

                                                 NATO Celebrates 70 Years
                                                 On 4 April, NATO marked its 70th anniversary in Washington, DC.

                                                 Celebrations took place in the Mellon Auditorium where the North Atlantic
                                                 Treaty was signed by the 12 founding Allies in 1949. In his remarks,
                                                 Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said:


        Time and again, Europe and North America have served together under the same
        flag. For the same cause of freedom and democracy. Deterring the Soviet Union.
       Bringing stability to the Western Balkans. Fighting terrorism in Iraq and Afghanistan.
       Changing as the world around us changes. And as we look together towards a more
                 unpredictable world, we continue to stand shoulder-to-shoulder.




       Reception to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the founding     NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg at a joint meeting of the US
                      of the Alliance, Washington DC, USA. April 2019.   House of Representatives and Senate, Washington, D.C. 3 April 2019.



To mark the Alliance’s 70th anniversary, the Secretary General was also invited to deliver a speech to a joint
session of the United States Congress in April 2019. He was the first leader of an international organisation ever
to do so. His speech focused on the bond between Europe and North America, the enduring strength of the
Alliance and the importance of transatlantic unity in an unpredictable world:


       Europe and North America are not separated by the Atlantic Ocean. We are united by
      it. And just like the Atlantic, NATO unites our continents. Our nations. And our people. It
     has done so for 70 years. And today we must do everything in our power to maintain that
                          unity for future generations. Because come what may,
                           we are stronger and safer when we stand together.

  Celebrating with NATO Citizens

  NATO’s public diplomacy agenda in 2019 focused on marking NATO’s 70th anniversary and the accession
  anniversaries of 12 Allies (20 years for the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland; 15 years for Bulgaria,
  Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia; 10 years for Albania and Croatia). The Alliance
  organised two “NATO Engages” public outreach events in Washington DC and London. These events gathered,
  respectively, over 400 and 600 participants from nearly 80 countries. The London conference focused on
  innovation, and aimed to build dialogue and seek a diversity of views from the next generation of leaders, with
  half the audience under the age of 35.
  The Public Diplomacy Division and the Policy Planning Unit in the Office of the Secretary General also organised
  a think-tank project in the framework of the ‘NATO@70’ celebrations, involving 16 think‑tanks in Allied countries
  as well as Carnegie Europe in Brussels. Think-tanks organised expert and public workshops in their capitals
  on NATO’s future role, with the findings collected in the report “New Perspectives on Shared Security – NATO’s
  Next 70 Years” presented to NATO’s senior leadership on 28 November 2019, and to the “NATO Engages”
  public diplomacy event in London on 3 December 2019.

The promotion of science and technology in NATO continued to be a team effort, predominantly driven by the
voluntary collaboration of national subject matter experts from Allied and partner countries. For example, the
NATO Science & Technology Organization’s Collaborative Programme of Work, which relies on a network of over
6,000 national scientists, researchers, analysists and engineers, comprised more than 280 research projects,
each planned and executed by experts from at least four nations.

                  interoperability, life-cycle cost and acquisition of missile stockpiles of NATO nations.
               -- assessed the effectiveness of anti-ship missile seekers against electro-optical and infrared counter-
                  measures, and identified counter-measure deficits.
               -- developed a common reference architecture for intelligent, autonomous and trusted agents to enhance
                  NATO’s cyber defence capability and resilience.
               -- evaluated existing literature on violent radicalisation to develop evidence-based and effective approaches
                  to preventing the recruitment of foreign terrorist fighters.
               -- surveyed existing models and tools for logistic analysis to identify gaps and share best practice advice.
               -- enhanced acoustic threat detection sensors and signal processing for NATO forces to better locate and
                  respond to hostile fire from rifles, rocket-propelled grenades, mortars, rockets and artillery.

In addition to the AWACS modernisation, NATO is already looking at its follow-on capability known as Alliance
Future Surveillance and Control, to be delivered around 2035, in parallel with the AWACS fleet’s retirement.
The first phase of this project determining the requirements of the new system was completed on schedule.
In the next phase, Allied industry from defence and other sectors will develop six alternative concepts of what
the future capability will be able to do. By taking a fresh look at how new technologies and their interplay could
fundamentally redefine surveillance and control in the future, these concepts will take into account disruptive
technologies such as Artificial Intelligence, Big Data and Autonomy. On this basis, the Alliance will establish an
agreed concept for the future.

Sigonella, Italy, marking an important step in the
delivery of this programme. The five aircraft and
ground stations will be handed over to the NATO
Alliance Ground Surveillance Force for operations in
2020, when the first missions are expected to begin.

The Alliance Ground Surveillance system is being

                        NATO is also taking steps to enhance intelligence-
                        sharing information among Allies through other parts
                        of the Alliance’s Joint Intelligence, Surveillance
                        and Reconnaissance. In 2019, NATO awarded
                        contracts worth EUR 8.5 million to procure data
                        servers that support the sharing of intelligence
                        products, such as images, reports or video clips
                        from across the Alliance.



                        Land Capabilities
                        In 2019, NATO’s land capabilities made significant
                        progress in the areas of autonomy, data networking
                        and examining future needs.

                        NATO completed an interoperability standard for
                        Unmanned Ground Vehicles to ensure that the
                        software driving such assets, and their controlling
                        systems from different nations, can communicate
                        efficiently. Many important aspects of this work
                        relate to the defence against cyber threats to such
                        vehicles. To that end, a code of best practice for both
                        software and hardware protection was developed
                        over 2019 for publication in 2020.

                        In addition to Unmanned Ground Vehicles, the
                        Alliance focused on Directed Energy Weapons
                        (laser, millimetre wave and microwave technologies)
                        that can be used to deliver scalable effects. In 2019,
                        a cutting-edge NATO standard for Millimetre Wave
                        Technology was developed.

                        Field Artillery also covered significant ground in
                        2019 with the successful implementation of the
                        Artillery Systems Cooperation Activities standard
                        in Exercise Dynamic Front II in Germany in March
                        2019. The exercise saw 26 Allied and partner nations
                        using a common standard to enable interoperability
                        of different national artillery software systems.

In 2019, NATO also launched the Next Generation
Rotorcraft Capabilities concept, aimed at ensuring
that the expected large-scale renewals of Allied
helicopter fleets in the 2035-2050 timeframe are
based on a commonly defined requirement. In
the near term, this approach is expected to yield
important multinational cooperative initiatives
between Allies.

In order to provide Land Manoeuvre Forces with
the necessary protection against the full range
of existing and emerging air threats, Allies also
agreed to develop a pilot project called “21st Century
Ground Based Air Defence”. Through this initiative
Allies will launch multinational capability projects for
innovative approaches against emerging air threats,
to include hypersonic unmanned systems, new-
generation stealth aircraft and cyber threats.

Maritime Capabilities
In 2019, NATO focused on creating an adaptable,
resilient and sustainable anti-submarine warfare
capability. The 2019 Dynamic Mariner and Dynamic
Mongoose exercise series experimented with a
number of predictive tools that help commanders
locate, track and effect submarines. The technical
and operational requirements for a next-generation
maritime patrol and reconnaissance aircraft capable
of conducting maritime operations were also laid
down in 2019.

– or NEMO – trials involved 13 nations, five
surface ships, eight air assets and approximately
1,500 personnel. The exercise tested how Allied
navies can defend themselves against anti-ship
cruise and hypersonic missiles with the use of
state-of-the-art technology. It gathered scientific
measurement data that will be used to further
reduce the susceptibility of NATO naval ships to
cruise missiles and precision-guided munitions.

Military exercises are one the most visible tools to
demonstrate NATO’s strengthened deterrence and
defence posture. During exercises, forces from
NATO countries jointly train and test their readiness
and responsiveness to rapidly unfolding crises,
ranging from collective defence to crisis response
scenarios. Exercises also provide a platform for
testing the application of technological innovation.

In accordance with Allies’ international obligations,
NATO is fully committed to transparency and
predictability. Exercise schedules are published
months in advance on NATO’s website1. Allies

Energy Security
Allies recognise energy security as part of their
common security. Energy developments to NATO’s
east and south can have security implications
for all Allies, while cyber and terrorist attacks can
target energy infrastructure, on which both civilian
populations and the military rely.                                              Energy and climate developments

  Dialogue with China

  NATO has a long-standing political and military dialogue with China, which provides a basis for mutual
  understanding and engagement. NATO wants to maintain a constructive relationship with China, based on
  shared interests and mutual respect. Continued and focused dialogue can enhance mutual understanding
  and dispel misperceptions. At their meeting in London in December 2019, NATO leaders recognised that
  China’s growing influence and international policies present both opportunities and challenges that NATO
  needs to address together as an Alliance.

  In 2019, dialogue with China was sustained through high-level interactions, including through meetings
  between the NATO leadership and the Head of the Chinese mission to the European Union, with military-to-
  military staff talks held in Beijing in September and with political high-level staff talks in Brussels in October.

-----------------------Page 92 End-----------------------

Progress in 2019

The imperative to incorporate a gender perspective
into all of NATO’s work is well-established, but
what that means and why it matters is not always
obvious. To illustrate how a gender perspective
made a difference to the Alliance in 2019, here are
two examples.

-- The uncontrolled proliferation and misuse of
   small arms and light weapons can have a deeply
   detrimental effect on security, peace and stability.
   In order to improve the overall effectiveness
   of activities in this area, NATO’s Arms Control,
   Disarmament, and Weapons of Mass Destruction
   Non-Proliferation Centre published, in October
   2019, guidelines for gender mainstreaming in
   the domain of small arms and light weapons.
   These guidelines are designed to ensure that
   the intersectional contributions and concerns of
   women and men alike are acknowledged and
   addressed equally. Advantages of adopting a
   gender perspective in this area are highlighted in
   the guidelines and include a more comprehensive
   understanding of security, particularly in low-
   intensity conflicts, improved local buy-in for small
   arms and light weapons activities, and more
   innovative and effective solutions generated by
   including women in decision-making.
-- The senior committee responsible for enabling
   delivery of interoperable NATO capabilities to
   all Allies is known as the Conference of National
   Armaments Directors. The Conference meets twice
   a year, and in 2019 considered the relevance of a
   gender perspective in relation to the development
   of military capabilities. In particular, this included a
   plan to improve the suitability of military equipment
   for women – an increasingly important consideration
   for the operational success of deployed forces.
The NATO Committee on Gender Perspectives
held its 43rd annual conference in June, bringing
together 150 participants from 36 countries to
discuss accountability and the integration of a
gender perspective. Key leaders discussed their
experiences and the changes they have seen over
time, and gender advisors and non-commissioned
officers shared successes and challenges they
have had with implementing gender perspectives at
the tactical level.

           Our Alliance is unmatched. We protect close to 1 billion citizens on both sides
           of the Atlantic. So what we say and what we do carries a great deal of weight.
          To navigate this unpredictable and challenging world, we must remain politically
                                     united and militarily strong.
                NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg on receiving the Manfred Wörner Medal.

NATO Headquarters and Structures
NATO Headquarters in Brussels houses the Alliance’s International Staff and International Military Staff, along
with 29 Allied delegations and military representations, 19 partner missions and staff from several NATO
Agencies. It is the main forum for the discussions and consultations that shape NATO policy and practice.




                            A green Headquarters
                            Since moving to the new Headquarters in the spring of 2018, NATO has been
                            engaged in becoming a greener organisation, paying particular attention to
                            waste reduction and eco-mobility investments. In 2019, NATO recycled 54% of
                            its generated waste and developed different initiatives to drastically reduce the
                            amount of waste produced at the Headquarters.

                            NATO’s new Headquarters has sustainable features that allow it to minimise energy
                            consumption, including through co-generation and geo-thermal energy solutions
                            to provide the electricity and heating used on site, along with slab cooling and
                            rainwater collection systems.

North Atlantic Council
The North Atlantic Council is the main political
decision-making body in NATO. It provides a forum
for consultation between Allies on all issues affecting
their peace and security. It brings together high-
level representatives from each member country to
discuss policy and operational questions requiring
collective decisions as well as to discuss and consult
on topics of common interest and concern.

Because decisions are made on the basis of
consensus, the policies agreed in the Council are
considered the expression of the collective will of
all member countries of the Alliance. The Council is
chaired by the Secretary General and all its decisions
have the same status, whether the meeting takes
place during a Summit of NATO Heads of State and
Government or in permanent session at the level of
Ambassadors.

NATO Funding
The costs of running NATO are funded through both
direct and indirect contributions by its Allies.

Indirect contributions are by far the largest type               I am proud to support the political
of contributions and include Allies’ participation in         leadership of the Alliance in their success
NATO-led operations and missions.
                                                                   to reach fairer burden-sharing.
Direct contributions are those made to finance
capabilities and initiatives that serve all 29 Allies,                  Martine Letellier (France)
such as NATO-wide air defence or command and
control systems. Costs for direct contributions                    Head, Finance & Secretariat Branch
are borne collectively through common funding,                        NATO Office of Resources,
                                                                     NATO Headquarters, Brussels
with all 29 members contributing according to an
agreed cost-share formula, based on individual
nations’ Gross National Incomes. Discussions on
fairer burden-sharing among the Allies throughout
2019 culminated with the adjustment of cost-share
formulas.




  NATO Common Funding Reform

  Allies regularly review cost shares for NATO’s common funded budgets. In 2019 Allies agreed a new
  cost-share formula for the upcoming years. Under the new formula, for the period 2021-2024, cost shares
  attributed to most European Allies and Canada will increase, while the United States’ share will decrease.
  The revised budget contributions refer to the NATO Security Investment Programme as well as the military
  and civil budget. This is an important demonstration of Allies’ commitment to the Alliance and to fairer
  burden-sharing. Under the new arrangements, the United States' contribution will be reduced from around
  22% to around 16%.




Common funding finances NATO’s principal                  Atlantic Council, managed by the Resource Policy
budgets and programmes: the Civil Budget, the             and Planning Board, and implemented by the
Military Budget and the NATO Security Investment          Budget Committee and the Investment Committee.

Each NATO project is financed through a
combination of common funding, joint funding,
multinational funding and national funding.
Participating nations, in cooperation with the
military authorities, identify the requirements,
the priorities and the funding arrangements, but
NATO provides political and military oversight. The
common funding process is overseen by the North

Engaging with Citizens
NATO actively engages with people around the
world to explain and promote the Alliance’s efforts
and activities in Allied countries and beyond.

In a more complex and competitive information
environment, NATO continues to work hard to gain
and maintain public support, as well as to counter
disinformation. To do so, it uses a wide variety of
tools, including press and media activities, NATO-
sponsored workshops and round tables, speeches,
the dedicated web portal ‘Setting the Record
Straight’, digital channels and briefing programmes
at NATO Headquarters in Brussels. With its
proactive communications, NATO aims to ensure
that its fact-based narrative features prominently in
the information space.

financing of the Afghan National Defence and Security
Forces, and enhance the Enduring Partnership with
Afghanistan, by strengthening political consultations
with the country and by strengthening practical
cooperation in areas of specific interest for Afghanistan.
These efforts are part of the broader engagement of the
international community in Afghanistan to ensure that
Afghanistan is never again a safe haven for terrorism.

Defence Expenditure of NATO Countries (2013 – 2019)
NATO collects defence expenditure data from Allies on a regular basis and presents aggregates and subsets of this
information. Each Ally’s Ministry of Defence reports current and estimated future defence expenditure according to
an agreed definition of defence expenditure. The amounts represent payments by a national government actually
made, or to be made, during the course of the fiscal year to meet the needs of its armed forces, those of Allies or of
the Alliance. In the figures and tables that follow, NATO also uses economic and demographic information available
from the Directorate-General for Economic and Financial Affairs of the European Commission (DG-ECFIN), and the
Organisation for Economic Co operation and Development (OECD).
In view of differences between both these sources and national GDP forecasts, and also the definition of NATO
defence expenditure and national definitions, the figures shown in this report may diverge considerably from those
which are quoted by media, published by national authorities or given in national budgets. Equipment expenditure
includes expenditure on major equipment as well as on research and development devoted to major equipment.
Personnel expenditure includes pensions paid to retirees.
The cut-off date for information used in this report was 21 November 2019. Figures for 2019 are estimates.

Notes: Figures for 2019 are estimates.
*	 These Allies have national laws and political agreements which call for 2% of GDP to be spent on defence annually,
   consequently estimates are expected to change accordingly. For the past years, Allies' defence spending was based on
   the then available GDP data and Allies may, therefore, have met the 2% guideline when using those figures (In 2018,
   Lithuania met 2% using November 2018 OECD figures).

      Notes: Figures for 2019 are estimates. The NATO Europe and Canada and NATO Total aggregates from 2017
      onwards include Montenegro, which became an Ally on 5 June 2017.
      *	 These Allies have national laws and political agreements which call for 2% of GDP to be spent on defence
         annually, consequently estimates are expected to change accordingly. For the past years, Allies' defence
         spending was based on the then available GDP data and Allies may, therefore, have met the 2% guideline when
118      using those figures (In 2018, Lithuania met 2% using November 2018 OECD figures).

Notes: Figures for 2019 are estimates. The NATO Europe and Canada and NATO Total aggregates from 2017
onwards include Montenegro, which became an Ally on 5 June 2017.
*	 These Allies have national laws and political agreements which call for 2% of GDP to be spent on defence
   annually, consequently estimates are expected to change accordingly. For the past years, Allies' defence
   spending was based on the then available GDP data and Allies may, therefore, have met the 2% guideline when
   using those figures (In 2018, Lithuania met 2% using November 2018 OECD figures).                             119
