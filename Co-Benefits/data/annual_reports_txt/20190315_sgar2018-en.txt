    For All Who Serve
    NATO’s greatest responsibility is to protect and defend the Alliance’s territory and
    populations against any attack. To achieve that mission, we rely more than anything
    else on the personnel of Allied and partner countries’ armed forces.

    Throughout 2018, tens of thousands of soldiers, sailors, aircrew and marines from
    North America and Europe were working under the same NATO flag – from the High
    North to the Mediterranean Sea, from the North Atlantic Ocean to Afghanistan. It is
    their skill and determination, above all, which keep our nations safe.

    The men and women who serve are the living embodiment of NATO’s values. They
    are the clearest and most powerful expression of everything the Alliance stands for.
    And we owe them and their families a profound debt of gratitude for the sacrifices
    they make on our behalf.

robust rapid-reinforcement strategy to ensure that,                                                30 squadrons

by a 40,000-strong NATO Response Force, which
includes the brigade-sized Very High Readiness
Joint Task Force, led in 2018 by Italy. A combined

  Reinforcement

  The Alliance is working to ensure that Allied forces can be quickly mobilised and deployed, if needed. NATO must
  be able to reinforce and support Allied forces already in theatre in response to any potential threat, conventional
  or non-conventional. The ability to deter and defend against any potential adversary relies on being able to
  reinforce Allies quickly and effectively – including from across the Atlantic Ocean.

  In 2018, Allies took a number of further steps to ensure more rapid reinforcement, including by working to
  improve the Alliance’s military mobility by land, air, or sea. This, in turn, requires improvements to legislation
  and procedures, command and control, transport capabilities and capacities, as well as an upgrade of the
  transport network infrastructure in Europe. The aim, by the end of 2019, is to shorten border-crossing times
  and minimise the time it takes for administrative approval of land, sea and air movement.

  Allies also plan to conduct military mobility exercises more regularly, as a key aspect of preparing for rapid
  reinforcement. As part of Trident Juncture 18, more than 180 flights and 60 shiploads of equipment and personnel
  arrived at 27 different points in Norway – including harbours, airports, and railway terminals. Equipment and
  personnel arrived from as far as San Diego, California – 8,300 kilometres to the west – and Izmir, Turkey –
  3,000 kilometres to the south.

  NATO continues to work hand-in-hand with the European Union to improve military mobility. Areas of cooperation
  include coordinated military requirements; customs and border-crossing legislation, regulations and procedures;
  and transport infrastructure.

Relations with Russia
In the years following the Cold War, NATO worked hard to build a strategic partnership with Russia. This involved
developing dialogue and practical cooperation in areas of common interest.

However, in 2014, as a consequence of Russia’s illegal and illegitimate annexation of Crimea, all practical cooperation
between NATO and Russia was suspended. Russia’s aggressive actions in Ukraine, its destabilising military behaviour
and use of hybrid actions against nations across the Euro-Atlantic region have significantly altered the international
security environment – reducing stability and security, and increasing unpredictability.

In 2018, Russia’s pattern of destabilising behaviour continued.

In March 2018, Allies condemned the attack involving a military-grade nerve agent in Salisbury, United Kingdom.
Allies stood in solidarity with the UK’s assessment that Russia is highly likely to have been responsible for the attack.

In October, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom briefed Allies about the attempted hacking of the Organisation
for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, which they assess was carried out by Russian military intelligence.

At the end of November, Russia used military force against three Ukrainian naval vessels in international waters
in the Black Sea, near the Sea of Azov and the Kerch Strait. Allies called for calm and restraint and urged Russia
to release the Ukrainian sailors and ships it had seized. Allies reiterated their full support for Ukraine’s sovereignty
and territorial integrity within its internationally recognised borders and territorial waters. They also committed to
providing further political and practical support to Ukraine.

In December, NATO Foreign Ministers concluded that Russia had developed and fielded a missile system that
violates the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty and called on Russia to return urgently to full and verifiable
compliance.

At the Brussels Summit, NATO leaders reaffirmed that the nature of the Alliance’s relations with Russia will be
contingent on a clear, constructive change in Russia’s actions – one that demonstrates compliance with international
law and its international obligations and responsibilities.

NATO’s policy towards Russia remains consistent: defence and dialogue. The Alliance maintains a firm position,
based on a dual-track approach of strong deterrence and defence complemented by periodic, focused and meaningful
dialogue with Russia.

NATO’s dialogue with Russia primarily takes place in the NATO-Russia Council, which serves as an important
platform to address international security issues, while also working to increase transparency and predictability
of military activities which, in turn, helps avoid misunderstanding, miscalculation and unintended escalation.
In addition, high-level meetings between NATO and the Russian leadership continue, alongside NATO’s military
leaders maintaining a channel of communication with their Russian counterparts. NATO is committed to ensuring this
channel remains open and ready for use, including in a crisis situation.

In 2018, the NATO-Russia Council met twice – in May and October. At the top of the agenda of each meeting was the
conflict in and around Ukraine, including the need for the full implementation of the Minsk Agreements. Both Council
meetings also addressed issues relating to arms control, military activities, transparency and risk reduction, including
by addressing the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty. In 2018, the issue of ‘hybrid’ or asymmetric techniques
was discussed in the NATO-Russia Council for the first time.

The NATO-Russia Council also continued the practice of reciprocal briefings on upcoming military exercises. During
both Council meetings in 2018, NATO briefed on Exercise Trident Juncture 18 and Russia briefed on its exercise
Vostok 2018. This practice has the potential to contribute to greater predictability and risk reduction in the Euro-
Atlantic area. However, NATO continues to make clear that voluntary briefings in the NATO-Russia Council cannot
replace mandatory transparency under the Vienna Document.

Attack against the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons
The extent to which malicious exploitation of cyberspace has become a strategic instrument for
states was revealed in October 2018, when a combined Anglo-Dutch operation foiled an attempt
to infiltrate computer networks of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons in
The Hague. The Netherlands and the United Kingdom attributed the attack to Russian military
intelligence. On the same day, the United Kingdom also identified Russian military intelligence as
being responsible for a range of other cyber attacks. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg
issued a statement expressing NATO Allies’ solidarity with the decision by the Netherlands
and the United Kingdom to call out Russia on its attempts to undermine international law and
institutions. He also called on Russia to halt its pattern of reckless behaviour.

  Modernising the Vienna Document

  Given significant changes in the security environment, Allies have made more than a dozen proposals on
  how to modernise the Vienna Document. They include:

  -- Improving the risk reduction chapter of the Vienna Document to address concerns about military activities
     that appear unusual or threatening to other nations
  -- Lowering the thresholds for notification and observation of military exercises
  -- Closing loopholes that allow countries to avoid notification and observation of exercises, including no-
     notice - or "snap" - exercises
  -- Strengthening verification by improving inspections and evaluations and by providing additional
     opportunities to visit military deployments and facilities in Europe
  -- Enhancing military-to-military lines of communication
  As of the end of 2018, Russia had refused to engage in these discussions, going as far as to withdraw its
  own proposals for Vienna Document modernisation.

-----------------------Page 30 End-----------------------

Nuclear Deterrence
NATO continues to ensure that all components of its nuclear
deterrence remain safe, secure and effective. The fundamental
purpose of NATO’s nuclear capability is to preserve peace, prevent
coercion and deter aggression.

In 2018, the Alliance’s Nuclear Planning Group met at both the
Ministerial and Ambassadorial level to consider the actions of
Russia – which has been modernising its strategic systems,
announcing new nuclear weapons programmes, deploying dual-
capable missiles, using irresponsible and aggressive nuclear
rhetoric, and developing and deploying intermediate-range
ground-launched cruise missiles in violation of the Intermediate-
Range Nuclear Forces Treaty.

At the 2018 Brussels Summit, Allies urged Russia to address
concerns about the development of a new missile system, noting
widespread doubts about Russian compliance. In December,
Allies formally concluded that Russia was in violation of the
Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty and called for Russia
to return to compliance with its Treaty obligations, noting that the
United States was adhering fully to its Treaty commitments.

Taking into account the challenges posed by an uncertain world,
the Nuclear Planning Group has taken careful and measured
decisions to maintain the effectiveness and coherence of NATO’s
nuclear deterrence, including decisions on adaptation to maintain
the credibility of the Alliance’s nuclear-capable forces.

NATO continues to exercise nuclear deterrence capabilities to
demonstrate effectiveness, with a growing emphasis on the
coherence of NATO’s conventional operations and nuclear
deterrence, recognising that nuclear weapons are unique and
that the circumstances in which they might have to be used are
extremely remote.

NATO remains committed to arms control and disarmament
as an essential contribution to achieving the Alliance’s security
objectives, but regrets that the conditions for achieving full
disarmament have not become more favourable.

In 2018, NATO continued to work to improve understanding of
nuclear issues across the Alliance. It did this by organising a
series of visits to nuclear bases and facilities, running a series
of courses on elements of nuclear deterrence for military and
civilian audiences from both NATO Headquarters and member
nations, and by sponsoring an annual Nuclear Policy Symposium
in Washington, D.C.

Aside from the independent nuclear capabilities of the
United States, the United Kingdom and France, and the
national contributions of dual-capable aircraft and associated
infrastructure, NATO works to achieve the broadest possible

                    NATO has pursued arms control,

for decades. The Alliance first put forward a
comprehensive disarmament package in 1957, and,
following the end of the Cold War, dramatically reduced
the number of nuclear weapons stationed in Europe
and the reliance on nuclear weapons in its strategy.

Throughout its 70-year existence, NATO has strongly

             Taking Stock of 2018
             2018 was a year of far-reaching reforms for NATO.                                     In 2018, Allies also endorsed a series of measures

Regional Planning Groups charged with drawing up
plans for the defence of their regions.

Preparing NATO for the Digital Age

NATO’s ability to harness the digital revolution is critical to the Alliance’s success. Innovations such as cloud
computing, edge computing, big data analytics, machine learning and artificial intelligence are transforming the
way large organisations operate.

The Alliance is determined to take advantage of opportunities provided by the digital age and to become a data-
driven organisation as a key step towards improving information-sharing and collaboration.

For instance, Allies are adopting a new approach to digital technologies for Consultation, Command and Control
capabilities, and information and communications technology services. This will help ensure a more effective
and coherent use of information technology across NATO’s civilian and military structures. The new approach
means that by 2025 all NATO entities will use a standardized set of information technology applications and
services. This will also improve the ability of Allies and partners to work together on operations.

NATO is also working in partnership with industry to explore the application of analytics and artificial intelligence.
For example, the NATO Industrial Advisory Group has conducted studies on human machine teaming, big data
analytics and autonomy, focusing on the impact of these technologies on NATO. Allied Command Transformation
partnered with individual companies, including on how to improve decision-making on defence planning and on
developing tools to shape and test future scenarios.

The NATO Airborne Warning and Control System
(AWACS) surveillance aircraft remain a workhorse
of the Alliance, and a symbol of NATO across its

AWACS maintained its high level of contributions
to NATO operations and activities, in particular in
support of the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS.

While NATO’s AWACS fleet is more than 35 years
old, it has remained relevant thanks to a cycle of
upgrades and modernisation. The most recent
modernisation effort – the Follow-On Upgrade
Programme – retrofitted all aircraft with modern
glass cockpits, providing NATO aircrews with the
latest digital technology. Improved flight simulators
have also been delivered to the AWACS force in
Geilenkirchen, Germany.

        Alliance Future Surveillance and Control
        NATO is actively planning for the AWACS fleet’s retirement around the year 2035, through the Alliance Future
        Surveillance and Control initiative.
        All 29 NATO Allies are involved in the planning and resourcing of the initiative, which has investigated, among
        other things, how combinations of air, ground, space or unmanned systems could be networked together to
        collect and share information. It has also assessed the applicability of transformative technologies like artificial
        intelligence, unmanned systems, miniaturisation, big data and the Internet of things.
        In December 2018, the North Atlantic Council declared the first phase of the Alliance Future Surveillance and
        Control Concept Stage complete, on schedule and on budget, and agreed to begin the second phase. Through
        this first phase, the Alliance was able to determine what requirements the new system will need to meet and what
        technologies it should be able to integrate. On this basis, beginning in 2019, a series of industrial competitions
        will be launched to invite the involvement of the private sector in finding related solutions.
        The Alliance Future Surveillance and Control initiative is a clear demonstration of NATO’s ability to innovate and
        to collaborate closely with industry.

 Anti-Submarine Warfare Exercises in 2018

 Anti-submarine warfare was a NATO focus
 in several exercises conducted in 2018. For
 example, in addition to training national and NATO
 personnel, NATO conducted experiments involving
 unmanned systems and Rapid Acoustic Predictive
 Service in exercises Dynamic Mongoose, Trident
 Juncture, BALTOPS and Dynamic Manta.

 Exercise Dynamic Manta, involving 10 nations, six
 submarines and nine surface ships, used complex
 scenarios to challenge NATO’s anti-submarine and
 anti-surface warfare specialists. Exercise Dynamic
 Mongoose conducted experiments involving
 unmanned sensors to collect environmental data.
 This data was used to improve prediction models
 for submarine detection.

 In 2018, the Alliance began to develop a new
 vision for future mine warfare operations. In this
 context, Exercise Rapid Environmental Picture
 demonstrated a new proof of concept for the use
 of unmanned systems for mine detection and
 classification.

The Centre for Maritime Research and Experimentation
In the mid-1950s, at the height of the Cold War, NATO found itself in an arms race on submarine technology.
Recognising the challenge, the Alliance decided to establish a collaborative research centre for anti-submarine
warfare. On 2 May 1959, the Supreme Allied Commander Atlantic commissioned the establishment of the Anti-
Submarine Warfare Research Centre in La Spezia, Italy.

Sixty years later, and after several name changes, the Centre for Maritime Research and Experimentation
continues to be a hub for maritime research, developing and delivering cutting-edge, field-tested technologies.

The Centre conducts pioneering research on a number of topics, including the effects of active sonar on marine
mammals. In 1999, the Centre established one of the world’s first research programmes on this topic, now
known as the Active Sonar Risk Mitigation programme. One of the benefits of the project was that an increasing
number of independent scientific and environmental organisations began to collaborate with the Centre on this
issue. Active Sonar Risk Mitigation policies, procedures and technologies have since been implemented, and
continue to be developed to minimise the potential impact of sonar on marine mammals.

The Centre is currently at the forefront of research into Allied robotic capabilities at sea including research and
development of autonomous underwater systems, interoperable communication protocols, and the use of big
data tools for decision-making. NATO has established a Maritime Unmanned Systems Initiative, supported by
13 Allied nations.5

Involving a total of 50,000 personnel, 250 aircraft, 65 ships and 10,000 vehicles from 29 Allies, Finland and
Sweden, Trident Juncture 18 was NATO’s largest Article 5 military exercise since the end of the Cold War. Hosted
by Norway, it comprised a computer-assisted command-post exercise and a live exercise. The latter took place in
Norway, Iceland, the Northern Atlantic and the Baltic Sea from 25 October to 7 November 2018. A Distinguished
Visitors Day was held on 30 October near Trondheim, Norway.
With air, sea and land elements, Trident Juncture 18 was designed to increase NATO’s ability to integrate Allied
command and force structures in operations on its territory. It also provided a venue for the certification of the
different elements of the NATO Response Force for 2019, and offered an opportunity to exercise NATO’s ability to
reinforce Allies, including from across the Atlantic Ocean.
The cold weather posed additional challenges for the forces involved, giving them valuable experience of operating
in extreme conditions.
As a high-visibility exercise, Trident Juncture 18 served as a conspicuous sign of NATO’s ability to prepare and
deploy forces as part of a major collective defence operation. It demonstrated that Allied forces would be able to
work seamlessly together during a crisis, anywhere on Alliance territory.

 The Defence Against Terrorism Programme of Work

 NATO’s support to Allies in defending against terrorism is underpinned by the longstanding Defence
 Against Terrorism Programme of Work. This facilitates cooperation in the development of capabilities to
 prevent, protect against, and respond to terrorist threats.

 In 2018, the Programme supported more than 20 projects in areas such as harbour protection against
 seaborne terrorist threats; defence against terrorist use of chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear
 agents; aircraft survivability; countering improvised explosive devices; explosive ordnance disposal; non-
 lethal combat capabilities; biometrics; technical exploitation; and capabilities associated with Special
 Operations Forces. The Programme engages regularly with partner countries, other international
 organisations and industry. There is also extensive cooperation with NATO Centres of Excellence.

 Gender and Counter-Terrorism

 The rise of violent extremism, often linked to terrorism, has prompted NATO to seek a better understanding
 of gender-related aspects of the phenomenon. The integration of gender perspectives into early-warning
 analysis can contribute to better situational awareness. NATO is also working with other international
 organisations. For instance, a joint NATO-EU workshop on early-warning indicators was held in November
 2018. NATO offers a wide range of related training and education opportunities and is developing a training
 module on Gender in Terrorism Education.

Key Euro-Atlantic Disaster Response Coordination Centre Activities in 2018

-- Albania was heavily affected by floods in December 2017. Following a
   request for assistance through the Centre, Albania received international
   assistance from December 2017 until March 2018, from 15 NATO and
   partner countries – Austria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Canada,
   Greece, France, Israel, Italy, Kuwait, Lithuania, Montenegro, Serbia,
   Slovakia, Slovenia and Turkey. International organisations and bodies
   such as Save the Children and the Red Cross also contributed to the
   international effort.

-- In July 2018, the Centre received a request for assistance from Latvia,
   following the outbreak of large forest and turf fires. Latvia requested aerial
   firefighting capabilities in order to reach inaccessible areas. Belarus and
   Lithuania provided firefighting helicopters.
-- Drought and unusually high temperatures led to around 40 active forest
   fires in Sweden during the summer of 2018. Several countries offered
   assistance on a bilateral basis and through the European Civil Protection
   Mechanism. Following a Swedish request through the Centre, a total of 15

Activities on the ground were based on an earthquake scenario consistent with the geological and environmental
challenges faced by Serbia. The scenario provided an opportunity to practise international cooperation and
strengthen the ability of teams from different nations to work effectively together across a wide range of relief
operations. These included urban search and rescue, emergency medical teams, water rescue, as well as
detection, protection and decontamination teams.
It was the Centre’s first exercise to feature the use of artificial intelligence in disaster response. It was also the
first time that teams were deployed to real and virtual exercise sites simultaneously. This is an important trend in
exercises and training which NATO is using to complement its conventional table-top and field exercises.

The European Union
In 2018, NATO and the European Union decided
to further deepen their longstanding strategic
cooperation. Key to this was the second Joint
Declaration signed by NATO Secretary General
Stoltenberg, European Council President Donald
Tusk and European Commission President Jean-
Claude Juncker, on the margins of the NATO
Summit in Brussels in July. The Declaration builds
on the first Joint Declaration signed in Warsaw in
July 2016, which set out the principles and areas of
cooperation.

The 2018 Brussels Joint Declaration highlighted
key issues such as the encouragement to involve,
to the extent possible, non-EU Allies and non-
NATO Member States in EU and NATO initiatives,

  NATO and Action Plan on Women, Peace and Security

  At the 2018 Summit, Allied leaders adopted a new policy and action plan on Women, Peace and Security,
  building on a framework of three guiding principles: Integration, Inclusiveness and Integrity.

  -- Integration: to embed gender into all NATO policies and activities.
  -- Inclusiveness: to dismantle all existing barriers standing in the way of the full implementation of the
     Women, Peace and Security agenda.
  -- Integrity: to enhance accountability and promote the highest standards of professional and personal
     conduct, both within NATO civilian and military staff.
  NATO Allies aim to make the policy and action plan an integral part of their everyday business in both
  civilian and military structures. This will contribute to a more modern, agile, ready and responsive Alliance.
  In addition, 22 NATO Allies and 18 partners have adopted national action plans for the implementation of
  Resolution 1325.

  Moving to a New Headquarters

  Following extensive preparations, staff moved to the new campus between March and June 2018. More
  than 4,000 staff were relocated – including 29 national delegations and military representations, NATO’s
  International Staff and International Military Staff and five NATO Agencies.

  Despite the inevitable disruption involved in such an operation, the work of the Headquarters continued
  unhindered – with two ministerial meetings held in April and June. In July, the new Headquarters was the
  venue for a two-day summit of NATO leaders.

Defence Expenditure of NATO Countries (2011 – 2018)
NATO collects defence expenditure data from Allies on a regular basis and presents aggregates and subsets
of this information. Each Allied country’s Ministry of Defence reports current and estimated future defence
expenditure according to an agreed definition of defence expenditure. The amounts represent payments by a
national government actually made during the course of the fiscal year to meet the needs of its armed forces or
those of Allies.
NATO also makes use of up-to-date economic and demographic information available from the Directorate-
General for Economic and Financial Affairs of the European Commission and the Organisation for Economic Co-
operation and Development. In view of the differences between this definition and national definitions, the figures
shown may diverge considerably from those which are quoted by media, published by national authorities or given
in national budgets.
Equipment expenditure includes both spending on major equipment and on Research & Development expenditure
devoted to major equipment. Personnel expenditure includes pensions paid to retirees.
The cut-off date for information used in this report is 12 February 2019. Figures for 2018 are estimates.

Notes: Figures for 2018 are estimates.
*	 Defence expenditure does not include pensions.
**	 With regard to 2018, these countries have either national laws or political agreements which call for at least 2%
    of GDP to be spent on defence annually, consequently these estimates are expected to change accordingly.

Notes: Figures for 2018 are estimates. The NATO Europe and NATO Total aggregates from 2017 include
Montenegro, which became an Ally on 5 June 2017.
*	 Defence expenditure does not include pensions.
**	 With regard to 2018, these countries have either national laws or political agreements which call for at least 2%      125
    of GDP to be spent on defence annually, consequently these estimates are expected to change accordingly.
