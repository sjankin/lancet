                                   A BETTER
                                   FUTURE
                                   Over the past 50 years, the Asian Development Bank (ADB)
                                   has worked to transform Asia and the Pacific from a region
                                   that was once engulfed by debilitating poverty and hunger.
                                   Today, the countries of the region account for one-third of
                                   global gross domestic product and contribute more than
                                   half of the world’s economic growth. The emergence of
                                   Asia and the Pacific as an economic force has raised living
                                   standards in dramatic fashion for many countries.
                                   ADB has been privileged to serve its developing member
                                   countries (DMCs). In partnership with its members,
                                   ADB has mobilized $267 billion in loans and grants to
                                   build infrastructure (for transport, energy, ICT and water
                                   and other urban infrastructure and services), support
                                   agricultural development, particularly in the early years
                                   of ADB operations, provide education, improve health
                                   outcomes, stimulate business, combat climate change,
                                   attract investment, and strengthen regional cooperation and
                                   economic integration in Asia and the Pacific.
                                   The region is, however, still confronted by significant
                                   challenges and, even as the organization marks half a
                                   century of providing assistance, ADB has a lot of work to do.
                                   Among myriad development issues, the region faces the
                                   difficulties brought by rapid urbanization, the threat of
                                   climate change, and growing demand for water and energy.
                                   Poverty and inequality remain widespread. There are still
                                   330 million people, or around 9% of the population of
                                   Asia and the Pacific, surviving on less than $1.90 a day, the
                                   threshold of extreme poverty. Another 1.2 billion people
                                   live on less than $3.10 a day, a poverty line more typical
                                   of low- and middle-income countries. In addition, the
                                   commitments made under the Sustainable Development
                                   Goals (SDGs) and the global climate agreement, adopted in

                                  HARNESSING A RIVER’S POWER IN PAKISTAN
                                  Residents of the Pakistani town of Besham, in the country’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa
                                  province, are among almost 5 million people set to see benefits flow from the
                                  mighty Indus River.
                                  For years, Pakistan has experienced power shortages, estimated at over 5,000
                                  megawatts during peak demand. These shortages have led to blackouts and load
                                  shedding, in turn causing economic and social turmoil.
                                  Part of the solution is the Indus River, which roars down some of the world’s
                                  highest mountains and glaciers to sweep across the vast irrigated plains of Khyber
                                  Pakhtunkhwa, Punjab, and Sindh provinces.
                                  The Indus River network is estimated to have the potential to generate 60,000 to
                                  70,000 megawatts of electricity, triple the total current demand in Pakistan.
                                  The Ranolia run-of-river hydropower project on the Indus River is part of broader
                                  efforts to harness Pakistan’s rich potential for clean energy. Ranolia is one of
                                  two hydropower projects being built by the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa provincial
                                  government under an ADB-supported program to develop renewable energy. The
                                  $510 million program—which is also financing four hydropower plants on irrigation
                                  canals in Punjab province—is part of a national plan to generate enough power
                                  to service about 600,000 new connections and improve the lives of 4.8 million
                                  people.
                                  The Ranolia project has brought significant local benefits, creating over 2,000
                                  jobs during construction. Of those, about 150 were for skilled workers, many of
                                  whom will continue to work at the facility. In addition to employment for locals, the

                                         GOING THE DISTANCE FOR ENERGY EFFICIENCY
                                         While Uzbekistan is rich in hydrocarbons and has been self-sufficient in power
                                         generation since the 1990s, the country faces an unusual energy paradox.
                                         Uzbekistan’s southern region, which accounts for 90% of domestic gas production,
                                         receives electricity from the northern provinces, where 70% of power generation
                                         infrastructure is currently located. This means gas is transported at great cost
                                         to the north where it is burned to produce electricity, which is then sent back to
                                         customers in the south.
                                         ADB is helping make Uzbekistan’s energy production more efficient. Along with
                                         $300 million from the Japan International Cooperation Agency, ADB provided a
                                         loan of $350 million to build two power generation units at the Talimarjan power
                                         plant, only 30 kilometers (km) from the Shurtan gas field, in the southeastern
                                         province of Kashkadarya.
                                         The new combined-cycle gas turbines—the cleanest and most efficient fossil
                                         fuel-burning technology available—are set to improve the plant’s efficiency
                                         enormously.
                                         “The plant will save 500 million cubic meters of gas per year,” says Murod Karimov,
                                         the plant’s construction manager.
                                         Getting the gas turbines to Kashkadarya Province took more than a year. The
                                         two 400-ton turbines traveled over 16,800 km from Kobe, Japan. They were
                                         transported by ship to the Caspian Sea port of Kuriyk, in Kazakhstan. From there,

                                          Namjilsuren Gombo and her five daughters live in a simple ger (a round hut made of
                                          canvas) on a mountainside on the outskirts of Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia.
                                          With an eighth-grade education and earning only a small income, 42-year-old
                                          Namjilsuren, who is a single parent, struggled for years to take care of her daughters.
                                          Some months, just keeping the children fed meant giving up other necessities.
                                          “Sometimes we didn’t have notebooks for them to use in school,” Namjilsuren says.
                                          “There were times before when I used to cry because I felt helpless.”
                                          Today, however, the Gombo family is enrolled in a food-stamp program run by the
                                          Government of Mongolia. The program helps Namjilsuren and thousands like her
                                          to buy flour, rice, and other basic commodities. Food stamps represent about 10%
                                          of average monthly spending for such vulnerable households in Mongolia, and using
                                          the stamps frees up money for other necessities.
                                          The food stamp program was, in large part, made possible by an ADB-funded social
                                          welfare project on food and nutrition, which played a crucial role in helping the
                                          government create the system. As a result of the program, the average daily calorie
                                          intake of Mongolia’s poorest 20% has increased from 1,728 in 2004 to at least 2,000
                                          calories in 2015.
                                          “With full stomachs, the children are much happier going to school and their grades
                                          have improved,” Namjilsuren Gombo says. “They never miss school, they are better
                                          fed, and they have something to wear. They are happy attending their classes.”

                                          FINANCIAL TRAINING SAVES MILES FOR MAINO
                                          Maino Trudi lives in a small village outside the Papua New Guinea (PNG) capital
                                          of Port Moresby. She supports a family of five children and eight grandchildren by
                                          selling fish and growing tomatoes and corn.
                                          Before Maino participated in financial literacy training, provided with ADB
                                          support, she had no choice but to travel many hours to her nearest bank branch.
                                          The training is part of an ADB project to expand microfinance in PNG, aiming to
                                          improve financial literacy and provide sustainable financial services across the
                                          country. About 85% of PNG’s population live in rural areas, and a large proportion
                                          of these people have very limited education and low literacy rates. Most people
                                          have never used a financial institution.
                                          Thanks to the training, Maino now knows how to access her bank account through
                                          her mobile phone, making deposits and transferring money on the spot.
                                          “I can do all my banking without having to leave my vegetable garden,” she says.
                                          Another person to benefit from the project is Mathew Simon, from Mendi in
                                          the Southern Highlands of PNG. Mathew earns a living by selling about 100
                                          newspapers each day. Through the financial literacy training, Mathew learned how
                                          to open a bank account and save his newspaper earnings for the first time.
                                          He now enjoys the flexibility of being able to deposit small amounts of money.
                                          “I plan to start my own business when I have sufficient money. I am on the way.”

                                      FLOWER POWER SEES SHAHAN’S BUSINESS BLOSSOM
                                      It was late afternoon and Shahan Ara was working hard to pluck all the flowers in her
                                      field in the Jessore district of southwestern Bangladesh. Shahan was aiming to send
                                      flowers to the market ahead of the national Independence Day celebration.
                                      In a country where subsistence farming is still common, Shahan Ara is a rarity. Rather
                                      than grow rice, she cultivates flowers—a high-value crop that is more complex to farm,
                                      but commands higher market prices.
                                      Shahan Ara’s shift from traditional farming to high-value cultivation was inspired
                                      by her participation in a crop diversification project run by the Government of
                                      Bangladesh. The project, financed through an ADB loan of $40 million, forms part of a
                                      broad national effort to expand agricultural productivity and increase farming incomes.
                                      Shahan Ara received training in floriculture and fertilizer and water management. She
                                      also received loans and opportunities to visit and learn from other flower farmers. Her
                                      business expanded significantly since her involvement with the crop diversification
                                      project, leading to a 150% increase in her income.
                                      Since 2012, the project has helped over 250,000 farmers—more than half of them
                                      women—to double their income. About 70,000 hectares of land are now devoted to
                                      diversified crop farming, and about 200,000 farmers have received more than $60,000
                                      in loans to help make the transition from traditional crops. The project has introduced
                                      and promoted 35 high-value crops. In addition to improving the overall efficiency of
                                      farms, and linking them to markets, farmers learn specialized skills to cultivate the
                                      often delicate and temperamental high-value plants.

                                             GREAT BENEFITS FROM GOOD GOVERNANCE
                                             Luningning Catibong, a 32-year-old mother of four, and her husband, Aga, are part
                                             of the Mangyan tribal community of Sablayan, in the Occidental Mindoro province
                                             of the Philippines.
                                             Luningning and Aga long dreamed that one day their children might have a local
                                             school to attend, making the perilous trek to the existing school a thing of the past.
                                             On 2 December 2012, the Inawa Panaynep (meaning “fulfilment of dreams”)
                                             Elementary School opened its doors to 144 Mangyan students. The school has
                                             a zero dropout rate, and the children achieve good grades using a customized
                                             curriculum that also preserves their cultural heritage.
                                             The opening of the school was part of a push by the Municipal Government
                                             of Sablayan. In 2011, the municipality earned the Seal of Good Housekeeping,
                                             qualifying it for subsidies from the Performance Challenge Fund to improve the
                                             standard of living in the area.
                                             The Performance Challenge Fund is one of many innovative and ongoing initiatives
                                             included in two ADB-supported governance reform programs. The main goal of
                                             the programs is to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of public services
                                             delivered by local governments in the Philippines. The programs give these local
                                             governments a larger share of tax revenue, and allow them to implement systems
                                             to report on finances and measure their performance.
                                             As a result of its strong financial management, the Municipal Government of
                                             Sablayan has since received enough funding to provide the community with a
                                             better access road, more clean water, and a maternity clinic. The incidence of
                                             respiratory illness has also been reduced.

                                      The private sector is the single most powerful catalyst for
                                      creating employment and generating economic growth. It
                                      is critical to achieving the globally agreed goals of ending
                                      absolute poverty and allowing all human beings to fulfill their
                                      potential. ADB intends to have private sector support become
                                      50% of its annual approvals by 2020.
                                      In 2016, ADB continued to help its developing member

                                      and foster competitiveness in the private sector. To

                                      private partnerships (PPPs). It also directly provided finance

                                      intermediaries, and other priority areas.
                                      ADB approvals of private sector operations in 2016 were
                                      slightly lower than the record levels achieved in 2015.
                                      ADB approved private sector financing of $2.5 billion and
                                      generated $5.84 billion in cofinancing, which increased by
                                      almost $1.2 billion compared to 2015. This includes a record
                                      $238 million in official cofinancing to support nonsovereign
                                      operations.

                                        ADB SPARKS INVESTMENT IN CAMBODIAN SOLAR
                                        Ever since Cambodia emerged from an era of conflict, ADB has been helping
                                        the country transition to a market-oriented economy driven by inclusive and
                                        sustainable growth. Annual growth rates in recent years have exceeded 7%, and
                                        poverty (defined by those living on less than $1.90 a day) has plummeted from
                                        47.8% in 2007 to 13.5% in 2014.
                                        Despite this rapid economic development, the legacy of the civil conflict
                                        that devastated Cambodia’s national infrastructure remains. While access to
                                        electricity in the country rose from 20.3% of the population in 2007 to 55% of
                                        the population in 2015, the rate is still among the lowest in Southeast Asia.
                                        ADB is helping address this issue by driving private investment in solar power.
                                        While solar power has great potential in Cambodia, it contributes less than 0.1%
                                        to the country’s energy mix and is not used at utility scale. However, with recent
                                        technological advances, utility-scale solar plants can now operate at production
                                        costs that compete with traditional energy sources.
                                        To embrace these opportunities, the Government of Cambodia competitively
                                        selected the Sunseap Group to install a solar plant with enough capacity to
                                        power around 15,000 homes. In December 2015, ADB approved a loan of $9.85
                                        million to Sunseap and a local partner. In addition to $3.6 million from ADB
                                        resources, the loan mobilizes $3 million of cofinancing from an international
                                        commercial bank and $3.25 million from the Canadian Climate Fund for the

                                    fully implemented, 25 are largely implemented, and 14 actions
                                    have been partly implemented. Only 6 actions have not yet been
                                    implemented. Most of the time-bound actions are expected to be
                                    completed within 2017.
                                    In 2016, ADB worked to simplify its documentation and review
                                    protocols, and streamline approval processes. Measures to
                                    improve disbursement performance resulted in one of the highest
                                    recorded disbursement levels for ADB in recent years, reaching
                                    $12.26 billion in 2016. Building on a 10-point procurement reform
                                    action plan, ADB has started to implement the second phase
                                    of its procurement reforms to increase procurement efficiency
                                    and the quality of consultants and contractors. The reforms will
                                    further simplify procurement procedures with greater flexibility,
                                    faster procurement times, and the use of new and advanced
                                    technologies in project design and implementation. ADB also
                                    continued to enhance development effectiveness by increasing
                                    project readiness and improving project management.
                                    In December, ADB approved the revision of its Anticorruption
                                    Policy to respond to global developments and enhance measures
                                    for addressing tax secrecy, tax evasion, and legal forms of
                                    aggressive tax planning at both the country and project levels.
                                    ADB has been fine-tuning its lending facilities in response to the
                                    new needs and demands of its developing member countries
                                    (DMCs). In 2016, it reviewed its Countercyclical Support Facility
                                    (CSF). The facility was originally launched in 2009 as a short-

SPECIAL APPENDIX
IMPACT OF THE
ADF–OCR MERGER
AND ADB’S FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS

     COMBINATION OF OCR AND ADF RESOURCES
     In 2014, ADB introduced a proposal to enhance ADB’s financial capacity in a sustainable manner through more
     efficient and effective management of its capital resources. The proposal entailed combining Asian Development
     Fund (ADF) lending operations with ordinary capital resources (OCR) and retaining the ADF as a grant-only
     operation. ADB would continue concessional lending on the same terms and conditions as currently provided to
     ADF countries through the OCR window, while the ADF would continue to provide grant assistance.
     In April 2015, the ADB Board of Governors adopted a resolution authorizing the termination of ADF’s loan operations
     and the transfer of ADF’s loans and other assets to OCR effective 1 January 2017 (the 2015 Resolution). This
     resolution was further amended in June 2016. Accordingly, on 1 January 2017, ADB transferred ADF loans and other
     assets totaling $30,812 million from ADF to OCR. The transferred ADF assets composed of loans including accrued
     interest totaling $27,088 million and liquid assets totaling $3,724 million. The source of funding for ADF came from
     donor contributions, OCR net income transfer and set-aside resources.
     The transfer of these assets was treated as a contribution from ADF to OCR and a return of the set-aside resources
     from ADF to OCR. This resulted in the recognition of one-time income of $30,748 million in OCR and a return of
     the set-aside resources of $64 million. The corresponding income recognized in OCR has been allocated to ordinary
     reserves as from 1 January 2017 following the adoption of Board of Governors Resolution No. 387.
     Appendix Tables A1 and A2 show the summary effects of the transfer of certain ADF assets on 1 January 2017.
     The proportionate interest of ADF donors in the transferred assets as of 1 January 2017, taking into account the value
     of paid-in donor contributions that have been made available for operational commitments which are deemed by
     ADB to be applied for the transferred assets, was determined in accordance with Article V of the Regulations of
     the Asian Development Fund. The value of each donor’s paid-in contributions was fixed in US dollars based on the
     special drawing right value of each donor contribution as of 1 January 2017. This was then used to determine the
     sources of funds in the transferred assets on 1 January 2017, the date of the termination of the ADF loan operations
     and transfer of assets to OCR. Under the 2015 Resolution, the proportionate interest of an ADF donor will be taken
     into account in the event of the withdrawal of that donor from ADB and ADB’s repurchase of its shares, and in
     the theoretical termination of ADB operations and liquidation of its assets. Appendix Table A3 shows the funding
     sources of the transferred assets.

        We have had a long sleep. Asians have been all
  too ready to rest upon the laurels of a distinguished past …
  But the time has come to roll up our sleeves and prepare to
            cultivate this new era of self-discipline.
                 Takeshi Watanabe, first ADB President, November 1966




 Half a century later, the region’s economic growth and success
  in reducing poverty have exceeded even the most optimistic
 forecasts. But we cannot be complacent. The fact remains that
there are still 330 million people living in absolute poverty across
                         Asia and the Pacific.
             Takehiko Nakao, current ADB President, 2016 ADB Annual Report
