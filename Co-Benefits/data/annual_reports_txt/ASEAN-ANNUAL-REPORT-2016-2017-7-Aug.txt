FOREWORD


                                     2017 marks the 50th Anniversary of ASEAN’s
                                     establishment as a regional organisation
                                     founded on the ideals of peace, prosperity
                                     and harmony. Five decades of evolution and
                                     development has brought ASEAN the
                                     unprecedented level of economic growth and
                                     peace dividends that have galvanised its
                                     position as one of the world’s successful
                                     inter-governmental         groupings.         Various
                                     mechanisms have been established for political
                                     and security cooperation within the region,
                                     and between ASEAN and external partners. 
                                     These mechanisms have resulted in tangible
                                     outcomes for ASEAN, laying the foundation
                                     for economic and socio-cultural development.
                                      
                                     Over the last 12 months, in efforts towards the
                                     realisation of Vision 2025, ASEAN has made
                                     substantial progress.
                                      
                                     In the political-security pillar, further efforts have
                                     been undertaken in building a rules-based,
                                     people-oriented,         and          people-centred
