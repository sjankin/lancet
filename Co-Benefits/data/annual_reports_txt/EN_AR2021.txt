A YEAR IN

REVIEW
In 2021, UNFPA continued to respond to the needs of women and girls with speed and
ingenuity, despite the ongoing challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. In defiance of
serious disruptions to family planning supply chains and services, overburdened health
systems, and a rising tide of gender-based violence, the organization recorded its highest
performance in achieving key outputs of its four-year strategic plan. UNFPA’s humanitarian
operations alone reached more than 29 million women with sexual and reproductive health
information and services, supported 1.5 million safe deliveries, and assisted millions of
survivors of gender-based violence this year. Telehealth services, online and phone-based
psychosocial support, and digital learning have been seamlessly integrated into many
programmes and operations, allowing UNFPA to reach more people, in more demanding
environments, than ever before.
These successes are a testament to the insight, vision and leadership of our field offices
around the world. They also highlight UNFPA’s strengthened collaboration with and
support for community-based, women-led and feminist-driven organizations. We saw this
in the East and Southern Africa region, where UNFPA worked with diverse stakeholders
to ensure ownership of, and buy-in to, programmes at all levels — from collaborating
with faith leaders to prevent female genital mutilation, to advocating for minimum age of
consent in marriage laws and training government agencies on data collection. In Latin
America and the Caribbean, UNFPA focused on national, regional and international efforts
to uphold the rights of excluded people, including through comprehensive strategies to
reach and empower marginalized groups.
UNFPA also rose to the challenge amid increasing calls for support on demographic
issues. In Eastern Europe and Central Asia, UNFPA’s priorities included responding
to demographic challenges, culminating in the launch of the Decade of Demographic
Resilience, which aims to galvanize action based on evidence and human rights. In
West and Central Africa, UNFPA worked through the Sahel Women’s Empowerment and
Demographic Dividend project to address issues affecting education and employment,

universal access to sexual and reproductive health and rights, and gender equality. In the
Arab States region, there was a focus on public advocacy and service provision, along with
the launch of a tool to track and measure progress in securing sexual and reproductive
health and rights. And in the Asia and the Pacific region, UNFPA was able to ensure lifesaving services for women and girls in Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Myanmar and more,
while also intensifying advocacy for population policies embedded in human rights.
UNFPA is now closing the chapter on its 2018-2021 Strategic Plan, a period that saw
both unprecedented ambition — in the form of UNFPA’s transformative results — and
unprecedented tumult. That experience has strengthened our organization. We are
undeterred in our goals and secure in the knowledge that we can, and we will, continue to
deliver for women and girls.

DELIVERING ON THE 2018-2021

STRATEGIC PLAN

The 2018-2021 Strategic Plan was the first of three consecutive strategic plans designed to guide UNFPA
in contributing to the achievement of the three transformative results and Sustainable Development Goals.
Yet these four years also saw the emergence of serious obstacles to this mission. In addition to the global
pandemic, the world witnessed widening inequalities, rising threats from climate change and mutiple,
overlapping humanitarian crises. Opposition to sexual and reproductive health and rights remained strong
around the world, and levels of official development assistance to support sexual and reproductive health and
rights fell. Available data indicate that progress towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals has
been insufficient.
Despite the adversity, UNFPA did make significant cumulative progress in achieving its intended results and
targets: Humanitarian response and reach increased. The number of deliveries attended by skilled birth
attendants increased by 17 per cent in 2014-2020 compared to 2007-2013, and in UNFPA priority countries,
the number increased by 44 per cent. Seventy-three per cent of countries now have laws and regulations that
guarantee full and equal access to sexual and reproductive health care, information and services for women
and men aged 15 years and older; these countries achieved the end-of-plan target by 97 per cent.
Progress was also made towards achieving UNFPA’s three transformative results – ending preventable
maternal deaths, ending unmet need for family planning, and ending gender-based violence and harmful
practices. In some cases, the pace of progress even accelerated over rates seen the previous decade.
However, further acceleration is needed to meet our objectives.
Ending preventable maternal deaths
Between 2000 and 2017, the world saw a 35 per cent reduction in maternal mortality. New global estimates are
not yet available to show progress made in 2017-2021. Still, there are indications that increased investments
in maternal health and health system strengthening are having an impact — including the growing number of
midwives trained to international standards.
Tragically, even before the COVID-19 pandemic, progress proved too slow to reach the Sustainable
Development Goal target on reducing maternal mortality, and there is evidence that the pandemic may have
negatively affected these efforts.
Ending the unmet need for family planning
Unmet need for family planning declined between 2018-2021, and the rate of decline was slightly greater in
some regions compared to the previous four-year period. Globally, 49 per cent of women or their partners were
using at least one method of contraception, representing an achievement of 77 per cent of the strategic plan
target. And by 2021, 77 per cent of women of reproductive age were meeting their family planning needs with
modern methods, representing an achievement of 93 per cent of the strategic plan target.
Still, the rate of reduction is not sufficient to end the unmet need for family planning by 2030.
Globally, the proportion of women of reproductive age who have an unmet need for family planning remained
around 9 per cent in the past two decades. The most recent data show that nearly half of all pregnancies
worldwide are unintended, and many result in unsafe abortions; this contributes to the high number of
maternal deaths.

-----------------------Page 16 End-----------------------

Ending gender-based violence and all harmful practices, including female genital mutilation and child, early and
forced marriage
Data on the global prevalence of gender-based violence remains scarce, and pandemic-related disruptions have
hindered the collection of reliable data during the past four years. Data from 2000 to 2018 indicates that an
estimated 736 million women – almost 1 in 3 – have been subjected to intimate partner violence, non-partner
sexual violence or both at least once during their lifetime. Further evidence during the pandemic, such as calls to
helplines and online search results, point to the rise of a so-called shadow pandemic of gender-based violence
during COVID-19 lockdowns. Despite these grim facts, there are promising signs that attitudes and norms are
changing around the world. Global commitments at the Nairobi Summit on ICPD in 2019 and at the Generation
Equality forum in 2021 showed strong international conviction that progress for humanity cannot be achieved
without the safety and participation of women and girls.
Since 2000, the prevalence of female genital mutilation has declined by 25 per cent, with a faster rate of
reduction seen between 2015 and 2020 compared to the period from 2010 to 2015. Additionally, data show us
that 25 million child marriages were averted in the past decade, thanks to accelerated progress in eliminating the
practice. Still, as is the case with all of UNFPA’s transformative results, the pace of decline has been uneven, and
it remains insufficient to meet the 2030 target.
As the organization embarks on the next phase of its journey to 2030, its 2022-2025 strategic plan, the lessons
from these last four years will be critical. They show us that progress can be made even under seemingly
impossible conditions. Now we must dramatically accelerate that progress with investment and action.
