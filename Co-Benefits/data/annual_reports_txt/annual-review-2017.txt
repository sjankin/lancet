                                                          The year in focus


                                                          About the EBRD
                                                          The EBRD is investing in changing people’s lives across three
                                                          continents – from central Europe to central Asia, the Western
                                                          Balkans and the southern and eastern Mediterranean. We do this
                                                          by financing projects that strengthen the private sector. The Bank’s
                                                          investment decisions are guided by our six ‘transition qualities’,
                                                          which focus on making economies more competitive, well governed,
                                                          green, inclusive, resilient and integrated. We operate in places
                                                          that aim to become stronger and more sustainable democratic,
                                                          open-market economies.
                                                          We provide financing for well-structured, financially robust projects
                                                          of all sizes (including many small businesses), both directly and
                                                          through financial intermediaries such as local banks and investment
                                                          funds. The EBRD works mainly with private sector clients, but
                                                          also finances municipal entities and publicly owned companies.
                                                          Our principal financing instruments are loans, equity investments
                                                          and guarantees.
                                                          The Bank maintains close policy dialogue with governments,
                                                          authorities, financial institutions, and representatives of civil
                                                          society, and provides technical assistance using funds donated
                                                          by governments and institutions. Donor funds play a vital role
                                                          in ensuring the success of these activities and act as a catalyst
                                                          for our investments.1 Moreover, donors finance seven multilateral
                                                          funds, managed by the EBRD, to increase nuclear safety in the
                                                          economies where we invest. The Bank also operates a community
                                                          initiative that helps staff and the EBRD to support charitable
                                                          and philanthropic activities in the region.




  In 2017, the EBRD secured for its projects some €876 million in donor funds. Among the many

  donors to EBRD operations were the European Union (which made available €313 million), and the
  Green Climate Fund (which made available €503 million). Details of all donors are available online,

                                                                    THE YEAR IN FOCUS




President’s message
The year 2017 will go down in the history of the EBRD as one to remember: 12 months
when records were broken and the path to greener transition was firmly set. It was proof
that the Bank remained a resilient partner despite the global economic context, which
continued to present serious challenges in our region.
We hit an all-time high for the Expected Transition Impact of our projects, an indicator
that the EBRD uses to measure its effectiveness. We invested a record €9.7 billion
through 412 projects, the most the EBRD has signed in a single year. And towards the
end of 2017, we signed our 5,000th project since the Bank was established in 1991.
Closer examination of these figures reveals a richer seam of impact. For the first time,
well over 40 per cent of our annual investment was in green financing – a target of
the EBRD’s Green Economy Transition approach that we had not aimed to reach until
2020. It was a tangible contribution to achieving the global Sustainable Development
Goals and a reminder that their success will depend on drawing in private finance, an
area in which the EBRD specialises. We also won the ThomsonReuters Project Finance
International Global Award for Multilateral Deal of the Year, for our work on solar energy
in Egypt, highlighting the fact that 25 per cent of all sustainable energy financing by
multilateral development banks comes from the EBRD. Capping these achievements
for 2017, our profitability remained strong.
But the EBRD is about far more than money. Increasingly, our policy work goes hand in
hand with our investment, maximising the Bank’s impact. In 2017, we helped Turkey
finalise its first National Energy Efficiency Action Plan and worked to improve corporate
governance in Ukraine, while in Jordan we launched a programme to raise the standard
of skills in the tourism and hospitality sector – just three policy activities among the
hundreds that I could have emphasised. The year also saw the publication of our first
strategy on economic inclusion.
Recognition of the EBRD’s strength came with a request from shareholders that we
broaden our reach to even more economies. We launched activities in Lebanon, and in
the West Bank and Gaza. We also returned to Uzbekistan after a long break, committed
to further developing the private sector there and supporting the new leadership’s
desire for reform.
Although our primary focus is the economies where we invest, internal reform of the
Bank continues apace, ensuring that we work in the best way possible and achieve the
strongest outcomes.
The EBRD goes from strength to strength and I look forward to another year of high
impact in 2018.

    RESILIENT
A resilient market economy supports growth while avoiding excessive volatility
and lasting economic reversals. In order to foster resilience, EBRD projects promote
financial and macroeconomic stability, energy and food security, and economic
diversification.

Pioneering investment in Turkish inflation-linked bond
The EBRD invested 100 million Turkish lira (€22 million equivalent) in a bond issued by utility group Enerjisa
Enerji to support its operations. This was the Bank’s first investment in an inflation-linked bond. Its five-year
tenor is the longest for an inflation-linked or local currency instrument issued by a Turkish corporation.
New era for Slovak covered bonds
In addition to investing €80 million in a series of mortgage-covered bonds issued by VUB, the second-largest
bank in the Slovak Republic, the EBRD partnered with the Slovak government to improve the legal and
regulatory framework for covered bonds. This work resulted in the adoption of a new law for this type
of debt security.
