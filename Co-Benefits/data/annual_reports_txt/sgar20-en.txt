    For All Who Serve
    NATO’s mission is to ensure that the Alliance’s territory and populations remain safe
    in a world where peace and security cannot be taken for granted. Our free societies
    and the rules-based international order need to be backed by credible transatlantic
    defence. NATO continues to rely on the personnel of Allied and partner countries’
    armed forces to fulfil this mission.

    Throughout 2020 and despite the COVID-19 pandemic, men and women in uniform
    from Europe and North America stepped up to the mark. They played an essential
    part to help fight the pandemic and save lives, including by transporting much-
    needed medical supplies and equipment, and building military field hospitals. In
    addition to supporting civilian efforts to combat the pandemic, they also continued
    to provide security for NATO’s nearly one billion people with strong deterrence and
    defence – on land, at sea, in the air, in space and cyberspace. Our soldiers, sailors,
    aircrew and marines served in NATO military commands, exercises, missions and
    operations to keep us all safe.

    We know that, should the need arise, they will stand together to defend and protect
    each other, keep our nations safe and our Alliance strong. We owe them and their
    families deep gratitude for their service and sacrifice.

     NATO 2030 – A Stronger Focus on Responding to the Security Implications of Climate Change

     In 2020, NATO laid the groundwork for playing a more ambitious role in climate security. During an online
     event in September, Secretary General Stoltenberg outlined his vision for NATO’s role with regard to climate
     change and emphasised that “NATO’s core task is to keep us all safe. Climate change is making the world
     more unsafe. So to fulfil our main responsibility, NATO must help to curb climate change.”

     He explained that there are three reasons why NATO needs to focus attention on climate change. First,
     climate change is making the world more dangerous. It fuels conflict, exacerbates threats and puts pressure
     on natural resources like food and water. Second, climate change creates harder conditions in which military
     forces need to do their jobs. As the climate changes, Allied forces will need to deploy in conditions that are
     wetter, hotter, dryer, or just more challenging. Global warming, sea level rise, rapid changes in precipitation
     patterns and an increasing frequency and intensity of extreme weather events also test the resilience of
     military installations and critical infrastructure. Third, NATO and its Allies also have a responsibility to help
     reduce climate change by producing fewer emissions.

     This is why, as part of his NATO 2030 initiative, the Secretary General is focusing on how to step up NATO’s
     climate change and security work. The Alliance is developing a concrete climate and security agenda
     focused on increasing situational awareness and adapting to the security impact of climate change, for
     example by enhancing resilience, reducing climate vulnerabilities and integrating climate security challenges
     into NATO plans, exercises and policies. Allies are also examining ways for NATO to concretely play its part
     in combating climate change, helping to reduce military emissions and improve operational effectiveness.

  Enablement

  NATO’s ability to deter and defend Allied territory and to deploy beyond NATO’s borders for crisis intervention
  depends on being able to move and sustain military forces by land, sea or air to, within, across and from
  Europe.

  Meeting this objective is at the core of NATO’s ‘enablement’ work. Successfully reinforcing NATO forces
  requires cooperation and coordination between national civil and military authorities, as well as commercial
  providers. This is essential to allow swift transit of military assets across national borders, efficient provision
  of commodities, assets and services – from fuel to water and food supplies – as well as robust physical
  and communications infrastructure. Given the scope of the task, NATO has adopted a broad, whole-of-
  government approach, setting enablement targets so that Allies can meet these requirements to support and
  sustain NATO’s posture and operations. The requirements range from having a solid legislative framework
  in place, to ensuring safe and effective communications networks, to establishing clear crisis procedures.

  In 2020, NATO continued to work hand-in-hand with the European Union to improve transport, infrastructure
  and regulatory aspects of military mobility, with a focus on coordinated border-crossing legislation,
  regulations and procedures, including for the transportation of dangerous goods.




In 2020, NATO maintained a series of assurance                        NATO also strengthened its ability to anticipate

NATO’s Maritime Posture: Security
At Sea
NATO’s posture, operations and missions at sea
are fundamental to the Alliance’s ability to deter
and defend. In 2020, NATO continued to reinforce
the Alliance’s maritime posture, bolster its ability to
provide security at sea and strengthen collective
maritime warfighting skills.

The Alliance maintained maritime presence at the
highest readiness with its Standing Naval Forces.

      Cyber Threats during the COVID-19 Pandemic
      In 2020, malicious cyber activity, including disinformation, hacking and espionage, were unprecedented
      in persistence, speed and scale. Technological changes – such as the roll-out of 5G wireless
      communications and the increasing adoption of connected devices – continued to provide cyber
      threat actors an array of new opportunities to achieve their objectives. Increasing connectivity trends
      accelerated by the pandemic rapidly shifted key activities online and provided new vulnerabilities for
      cyber threat actors to exploit. During the pandemic, malign actors openly targeted critical pandemic
      response sectors – such as medical facilities and researchers – and seized on the crisis to promote
      narratives designed to undermine trust in democratic processes and institutions. In June 2020, the
      North Atlantic Council publicly condemned destabilising and malicious cyber activities taking place in
      the context of the pandemic. This was an expression of Allied solidarity and mutual support for those
      dealing with the consequences of attacks including healthcare services, hospitals and research
      institutes. The statement also called for respect for international laws and norms of responsible state
      behaviour in cyberspace.

Relations with Russia
NATO’s dual-track approach to Russia is based on two pillars: defence and dialogue.

After the end of the Cold War, NATO made considerable efforts to build a strategic partnership with Russia, based
on dialogue and practical cooperation in areas of common interest. Key milestones in the NATO-Russia relationship
included the 1997 signing of the NATO-Russia Founding Act and the 2002 creation of the NATO-Russia Council,
established to serve as the primary forum for dialogue and cooperation between NATO Allies and Russia.

In 2014, as a consequence of Russia’s illegal and illegitimate annexation of Crimea, NATO suspended all practical
cooperation with Russia. Allies decided that there can be no business as usual until Russia returns to compliance
with international law.

In 2020, Allies remained concerned about Russia’s destabilising policies and provocative military activities near
NATO’s borders, as well as by its conventional and hybrid operations, including in Libya, Syria and Ukraine. Russia
continued to conduct no-notice exercises as well as large-scale exercises, such as KAVKAZ 2020, increasing
the Alliance’s concern regarding regional security. In September, the North Atlantic Council strongly condemned
the poisoning of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny. Allies called on Russia to bring those responsible to
justice, bearing in mind its commitments under the Chemical Weapons Convention.

NATO’s dual-track approach allows the Alliance to respond to the deteriorated security environment caused
by Russia’s actions. This is why Allies continued to strengthen their deterrence and defence capabilities, while
remaining open to a focused, periodic and meaningful dialogue with Russia. NATO is committed to discussing
critical issues and avoiding misunderstandings, miscalculation and unintended escalation.

In 2020, NATO remained open to dialogue in the NATO-Russia Council to address international security issues, as
well as increase transparency and predictability. Since February, NATO has repeatedly invited Russia to convene
a meeting of the NATO-Russia Council. Russia has consistently declined these invitations. Consequently, there
were no meetings of the NATO-Russia Council in 2020.

Contacts between high-level officials have continued. In February, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg met
with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in the margins of the Munich Security Conference. Issues discussed
included NATO-Russia relations, the conflict in Ukraine, transparency and risk reduction, arms control, and the
peace process in Afghanistan. The Secretary General underscored NATO’s commitment to its dual-track policy
towards Russia.

Contacts between NATO military leaders and their Russian counterparts have also been maintained. In February
and April, Supreme Allied Commander Europe General Tod D. Wolters engaged with Russian Chief of the General
Staff General Valery Gerasimov. In July, the Chairman of the NATO Military Committee, Air Chief Marshal Sir
Stuart Peach, had a phone call with General Gerasimov.

NATO continued a dialogue with Russian civil society and Russian media to counter government-led hostile
disinformation and set the record straight. These engagements are conducted both in digital form via dedicated
vlogs, social media posts and videos and directly with Russian audiences by engaging with students and key
opinion formers. In 2020, NATO staff organised eight online seminars with Russian audiences.

          NATO Allies and our militaries have been supporting each other and our partners

            civilian efforts and helping to save lives. At the same time, we remain vigilant
          and ready, because NATO’s main responsibility is to make sure this health crisis

     In 2019 a survey of 28,752 adults was carried out by Populus. Interviews were conducted online, except for North Macedonia, Albania and Montenegro where a face-to-face
     methodology was used due to the limited penetration of online panels in these countries. In all countries polled online a sample of at least 1,000 respondents per country
     was achieved. In face-to-face countries at least 500 individuals per country were interviewed. Quotas for gender, age and region were set and post-weighting was applied to
     ensure the samples for each country were representative of the adult population. Total results (across all Allies polled) were weighted to the population distribution of NATO.
	    The surveys referenced are based on non-probability sampling, with an indicative margin of error of ± 3%.

Spread of contagious disease and economic crisis are primary concerns
for Allied citizens
Alliance-wide, concerns about the risk of war remain low (14%).
In 2020, there has been a significant shift in topics of concern among Allied citizens in the context of the COVID-19
pandemic. The priority concern for Allied citizens is contagious disease (40%). These data show responses to the
question ‘Which of the following are of greatest concern to you?’ in November 2019 and November 2020.

  Engaging Young People

  In the context of the Secretary General’s NATO 2030 initiative, NATO actively engaged young audiences and
  sought their views, ideas and recommendations on how to make the Alliance future-proof.
  On 28 September 2020, the Secretary General engaged with nearly 800 students from 10 universities across
  the Alliance. They discussed the challenges that NATO is facing, with a focus on climate change.
  On 9 November 2020, the NATO 2030 Youth Summit, organised in cooperation with the Munich Security
  Conference, brought together hundreds of young people from across the Alliance for an online conversation with
  the Secretary General and other NATO leaders, and a series of interactive debates focused on keeping NATO
  strong militarily, making it stronger politically and taking a more global approach. At the event, the Secretary
  General said, “You – tomorrow’s leaders, both in North America and Europe – have the greatest stake in our
  security. So NATO 2030 is the chance for you to step up. And safeguard your future. Your freedom. Your Alliance.”

Protecting Our Citizens against Hostile
Narratives and Disinformation

NATO adapted to respond to the proliferation of
disinformation, propaganda and misinformation
during the pandemic. On this, NATO’s principle
is clear – the Alliance is committed to fact-
based, timely, credible public communications.
This allows NATO to have an impact in a
contested information space.                                     In 2020, NATO quickly adapted
                                                                to both understand and respond to
The Alliance’s approach to disinformation
involves a twin-track model. First, NATO seeks to

and analysing reports on the changing information              Allied citizens with proactive, factual
environment relevant to NATO’s mission. This                      communications that strengthen
enables NATO to evaluate the effectiveness of its               public support for the Alliance and
own communications, and to assess the impact
of hostile information activities in the information
                                                               our belief in freedom, democracy and
space.                                                                     the rule of law.
The Alliance then embeds these insights into its
response, enabling NATO to engage audiences by                    Chris Riley (United Kingdom)
tailoring its communications to effectively counter           Head, Strategic Communications Unit,
disinformation. For example, in July 2020, NATO              NATO Headquarters, Brussels, Belgium
launched a targeted social media campaign
with the goal of raising awareness about, and
building resilience against, misinformation and
disinformation in the context of the pandemic.
Innovative posts reached out particularly to
younger audiences and were widely shared on
social media. The campaign was run in Bosnian, Czech, English, French and Russian languages.
These two strands of work are underpinned by coordination with Allies, partners and other institutions, such as
the EU, the G7 and the United Nations.
The sophistication of hostile information, including disinformation, is expected to continue to grow. For this
reason, building robust resilience over the medium to long term remains necessary. It is also important for
citizens to assess the information they receive critically. NATO contributed to these efforts to build societal
resilience to disinformation. Non-governmental organisations, think-tanks and universities were invited (through
a call for applications at the end of 2020) to submit innovative projects aimed at enhancing societal resilience
to disinformation. Of the 62 projects received, 30 were selected for NATO support. The selected projects range
from handbooks and techniques on how to detect and counter disinformation, to analytical studies and online
education initiatives.

                     we need to stay the course. Because the threats and the challenges that
                      made us agree to spend more in the first place have not disappeared.

         The 2014 Defence Investment Pledge
         At the NATO Summit in 2014, Allies endorsed the Defence Investment Pledge and recognised that
         fair burden-sharing is the foundation of the Alliance. The pledge calls for all Allies to aim to meet
         the NATO-agreed guideline of spending 2% of Gross Domestic Product on defence by 2024, and to
         spend at least 20% of annual defence expenditure on major new equipment, including related research
         and development, within the same timeframe. The pledge also commits Allies to ensuring that their
         land, air and maritime forces meet NATO-agreed guidelines for deployability, sustainability and other
         agreed metrics, and that their armed forces can operate together effectively, including through the
         implementation of NATO standards and doctrines.

MODERNISING NATO

                              Technological dominance has always been key to NATO’s success.
                      But that dominance is now being challenged by those who do not share our values.
                                              So we must redouble our efforts
                                                   NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg,
                                                       GlobSec 2020, 7 October 2020.


             One of NATO’s greatest strengths is its ability                        In 2020, NATO adapted to meet the challenges
             to adapt to the changing security environment –                        of a more complex security environment. The
             something it has done again and again since its                        Alliance continued to modernise its structures and
             creation in 1949.                                                      capabilities and redoubled its efforts with respect to

                   Ongoing Modernisation of the NATO Command Structure
                   The NATO Command Structure – the military backbone of the Alliance – continued to adapt to a
                   changing security environment. More than 1,200 additional posts have been established since 2018. The
                   operational command in Ulm, Germany (Joint Support and Enabling Command) that supports the rapid
                   movement of troops and equipment into, across and out of Europe, became operational in September
                   2019. In September 2020, the Joint Force Command in Norfolk, Virginia (United States) reached initial
                   operational capability. This new command focuses on protecting transatlantic sea lines of communication.
                   The Cyberspace Operations Centre at Allied Command Operations in Mons, Belgium also became
                   operational in 2020. This centre coordinates NATO operations in cyberspace, provides cyberspace
                   situational awareness, assesses risks and supports decision-making, planning and exercises.

                   In October 2020, Allies decided to establish a NATO Space Centre at Allied Air Command in Ramstein,
                   Germany to help coordinate Allied space activities; support NATO missions and operations from space,
                   including with communications and satellite imagery; and protect Allied space systems by sharing
                   information about potential threats. The Alliance also opened two new Joint Logistics Support Groups in
                   Brunssum, the Netherlands, and Naples, Italy.

In 2020, 20 Allies5 virtually launched four new
High-Visibility Projects covering a wide range of
capabilities:

-	 The NATO Flight Training Europe initiative aims to
   create a network of pilot training campuses across
   Europe to address the fact that European Allies
   operate a large number of training facilities that
   are not systematically connected. The initiative is
   catered to the entire spectrum of aircrews, including
   those dedicated to operating fighter jets, fixed-wing
   aircraft, helicopters, as well as remotely piloted air
   systems.
-	 The Modular Ground Based Air Defence project
   seeks to develop a more versatile and flexible
   solution to the full range of air and missile threats                                   Eleven Defence Ministers launch the NATO Flight Training Europe

     Under the Multi Role Tanker Transport Capability framework, developed jointly by NATO and the EU, the
     first three aircraft were delivered to the multinational fleet in Eindhoven, the Netherlands. In 2020, the ninth
     aircraft was added to the contract after Luxembourg’s decision to increase its participation in the programme
     from 200 to 1,200 flight hours. The remaining six aircraft will be delivered over the coming years, with the
     final delivery scheduled for 2023. The fleet will be used by the participants6 to provide air-to-air refuelling,
     vital in supporting operations that require long-range air missions, as well as medical evacuation if needed.

         NATO’s Future Surveillance and Control Capabilities
         The NATO Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS) has been the backbone for Alliance
         operations. It has patrolled American skies after 9/11, served to support NATO’s operation in
         Afghanistan and provided assistance to the Global Coalition against ISIS, among other tasks. The
         Alliance is currently undertaking a major modernisation programme that will equip the AWACS fleet with
         sophisticated new communications and networking capabilities.

         At the same time, under the Alliance Future Surveillance and Control initiative, NATO is working in close
         partnership with Allied industry to maintain its situational awareness and decision-making advantage.
         To do so, NATO is looking to develop a follow-on capability that will replace the AWACS fleet after its
         retirement around 2035. NATO took major decisions in 2020. In March, NATO received six high-level
         concept proposals developed by six transatlantic firms and consortia, comprising expertise from both
         defence and non-defence sectors. The concepts encompassed innovative ideas to fulfil the AWACS
         missions in unique and disruptive ways. In November, Allied leaders selected the best ideas from the

Maritime Capabilities
NATO focused on high-end warfighting capabilities,
including by investing in electronic warfare
capabilities, creating specialist teams to tackle
the threat posed by hypersonic systems, and
accelerating interoperability of new technologies
with conventional forces to increase the Alliance’s
readiness. NATO also developed a strategy and
technical guidance to ensure its ships are able to
operate in the extremely harsh environment in the

  The scientific committees in the NATO Science and Technology Organization annually recognise the
  exceptional contributions of their early career scientists through the Young Scientist Awards. These awards
  are designed to encourage participation of promising young researchers and to enrich diversity in the
  NATO Science and Technology community. The 2020 winners worked on topics such as the exploitation of
  social media for intelligence purposes or the military applications of the Internet of Things. One of the 2020
  Young Scientist award winner was Mr Manas Pradhan from the Fraunhofer Institute for Communication,
  Information Processing and Ergonomics in Germany. He has been a key driver of the NATO Science and
  Technology Organization’s research on Military Applications of Internet of Things, in particular for improving
  NATO’s urban operations.

     Assessing the Impact of Emerging and Disruptive Technologies
     The NATO Industrial Advisory Group finalised a report on the impact of emerging and disruptive
     technologies on NATO capability development. More than 80 experts, representing 45 companies from
     13 Allied nations, evaluated the technological maturity and the readiness of the market to absorb critical
     technologies including artificial intelligence, hypervelocity, biotechnology, quantum technologies,
     as well as 5G and 6G. They also evaluated the potential of new technological and manufacturing
     processes such as additive manufacturing, thermoforming and continuous compression molding. The
     group studied meta- and nano-materials as well as new forms of energy generation and storage. The
     findings and recommendations of the report are being evaluated with the aim of incorporating these
     technologies in the NATO Defence Planning Process.

approach to intelligence and security. Intelligence
assessments facilitate better understanding of
threats and risks, enhance situational awareness
and are crucial to the adaptation of Alliance security

Allies recognise the critical role that intelligence
plays in support of strategic decision-making and in
the long-term direction and guidance for the Alliance
as a whole. NATO, alongside the Allied intelligence
community, continued to provide intelligence
assessments that bring the widest possible range
of quality reporting and analysis tailored to the
needs of senior military and political decision-
makers. In 2020, the Organization developed a
new daily analytic product focused on situational
awareness and warning. In addition, the production
of intelligence related to new NATO priority areas,
such as cyberspace, space and emerging and
disruptive technologies was increased.

JOINT WARRIOR                                                               26 March – 9 April             United Kingdom
The UK-led multinational naval exercise involved over 6,000 personnel,        4-15 October
81 aircraft, two submarines and 28 ships. Fourteen NATO Allies (Belgium,
Canada, Denmark, Estonia, France, Germany, Latvia, Lithuania, the
Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Turkey, the United Kingdom and the United
States) participated in the exercise. Military personnel from Japan and the
United Arab Emirates were also involved. The exercise addressed the full
spectrum of joint warfare missions and was designed to ensure maximum
preparedness in the face of any threat.
SPRING STORM                                                                      25 April - 8 May                  Estonia
The largest annual Estonian exercise involved just 3,200 troops from four
NATO Allies (Estonia, Denmark, the United Kingdom and the United States)
due to downscaling prompted by COVID-19. In a normal year, the exercise
typically involves around 10,000 troops from NATO Allies and partner nations.
The exercise, used to test the readiness of the Estonian armed forces and
enhance interoperability with Allied forces, included a 24-hour mission in
which US B-1 bombers flew from the continental US to Estonia, demonstrating
the unique capabilities the US could bring to Europe in a crisis.
OPEN SPIRIT                                                                          4-14 May            Baltic Sea, Latvia
In 2020, this annual exercise was led by Latvia. The exercise involved 10
ships as well as personnel from five NATO Allies ( Estonia, Germany, Latvia,
the Netherlands and Norway). OPEN SPIRIT involved Standing NATO Mine
Countermeasures Group One (SNMCMG1) and focused on naval mine
warfare to remove historical ordnance from the seabed. Thirty-two pieces of
historical ordnance were found and neutralised during the exercise.
ANAKONDA                                                                      25 May – 18 June                      Poland
The annual Polish live exercise was downscaled due to COVID-19 and
included about 5,000 national troops, 29 aircraft and 19 ships. The exercise
strengthened synchronisation and planning to prepare for the conduct of joint
defence operations.
ALLIED SPIRIT                                                                       5-19 June                       Poland
Part of Defender-Europe 20, this exercise was jointly led by the United States
and Poland, and involved over 6,000 troops from the two Allies. In response
to the COVID-19 pandemic, this exercise was adapted in line with the overall
downscaling of Defender-Europe 20. The exercise tested interoperability
between US and European forces and the integration of Alliance capabilities. It
also established a common intelligence operational framework. The exercise
further displayed combined readiness and operability in the COVID-19
environment.

     Supporting a Political Solution to the Conflict
     NATO is strongly committed to Afghanistan’s long-term security and stability. The only way to ensure
     this is through an Afghan-owned and Afghan-led peace process that finds a political solution to end
     decades of conflict. In February, NATO welcomed the US-Taliban agreement and the US-Afghanistan
     Joint Declaration as significant first steps in pursuit of a peaceful settlement. Allies urged the Afghan
     government and the Taliban to fulfil their commitments to working toward a comprehensive peace
     agreement that puts an end to violence and builds on the progress of the last two decades to safeguard
     human rights, uphold the rule of law, and ensure that Afghanistan never again serves as a haven for
     terrorists. The start of the peace negotiations, announced in September, marked a positive step in the
     peace process. At the same time, challenges remain, including high levels of violence, driven especially
     by Taliban attacks. NATO has consistently called on the Taliban to live up to their commitments, break
     ties with al-Qaeda and other terrorist groups, reduce violence and negotiate in good faith.

     NATO backs the peace process and has agreed to adjust its presence on the ground to support it.
     NATO’s presence in Afghanistan remains conditions-based. Allies continue to assess the situation
     and consult on the way forward together.

NATO in Iraq
NATO Mission Iraq is helping to strengthen the
Iraqi security forces and institutions so that they
can better prevent the return of ISIS and keep their
country secure and stable. In 2020, the mission
focused especially on senior-level advising,
training and capacity-building and on supporting
professional military education institutions. Due
to increasing security threats and the COVID-19
pandemic, the mission had to temporarily suspend
some training activities and redeploy part of its
personnel outside Iraq, but it remained operational
throughout the year.

     Supporting Partners in the Fight against Terrorism – Training and Education
     The Alliance supports partners’ efforts to fight terrorism, including through training and education.
     In 2020, NATO launched its first standardized curriculum in counter-terrorism, designed to help
     interested Allies and partners enhance their capacities to develop their national skills and improve
     counter-terrorism strategies. NATO also explored how to strengthen its practical cooperation with
     the African Union in the fields of counter-terrorism education and training and countering improvised
     explosive devices. It increased its defence capacity building support to Jordan and enhanced its
     cooperation with Tunisia, including through a project to develop a deployable capability for the
     detection, identification and monitoring of biological and chemical agents.

  Countering Unmanned Aircraft Systems

  Recent years have seen great developments in the field of unmanned aircraft systems and robotics.
  Terrorist groups, including ISIS, are increasingly misusing unmanned aircraft systems to plan, prepare and
  execute attacks. Preventing, protecting and recovering from such attacks require a coherent and holistic
  approach. Through the NATO Counter Unmanned Aircraft Systems Working Group, Allies have been able
  to exchange views, cooperate and learn from each other. In 2020, the group developed guidelines for Allies
  and partners to better cope with the threat of unmanned aircraft systems through the full protection chain
  (prevention, detection, identification, tracking, engagement, post-event actions), both when deployed and
  in their own homeland. NATO also conducted two key trials to assess and drive counter-unmanned aircraft
  systems technological developments. In 2020, the Netherlands hosted a technical interoperability exercise
  to create a reference data set to help Allies better detect unmanned aircraft systems, exploiting sensor
  fusion and machine learning technologies. In addition, Belgium led the testing of traditional weapons
  capabilities to cope with the unmanned aircraft systems threat.

Projecting Stability at Sea
Through its maritime posture and its operations and
missions at sea, NATO contributes to deterrence
and defence but also to projecting stability. It works
together with partners and other international
organisations to enhance maritime situational
awareness, build maritime capacity and ultimately
provide a safe and secure maritime environment.

NATO’s Open Door
In March 2020, NATO welcomed North Macedonia
as the 30th member of the Alliance. Its membership
enhances the security of the Western Balkans,
a region of great strategic importance to NATO.
Membership for North Macedonia also demonstrates
NATO’s own commitment to its Open Door Policy,
which is a founding principle of the North Atlantic
Treaty and one of the Alliance’s greatest and most
tangible successes throughout the years.

NATO’s door remains open to all European
democracies that share the values of the Alliance,
are willing and able to assume the responsibilities
and obligations of membership, are in a position to
further the principles of the North Atlantic Treaty,
and whose inclusion can contribute to the security of
the North Atlantic area. Every country must be free
to choose its own security arrangements, including
whether or not to join any treaty or alliance like
NATO. Yet, decisions on enlargement are for NATO
itself and require the consensus of all its members.

Throughout 2020, NATO continued to support Bosnia
and Herzegovina’s reform efforts on the basis of its
reform programme, which the country submitted in
December 2019. Allies also remained committed to
supporting eventual NATO membership of Georgia
and Ukraine, in line with the 2008 Bucharest Summit
decision, and subsequent Summits.

        We have made significant progress in the past. Now we must seize the opportunities
          in the future, to further implement the Women, Peace and Security agenda […]
             Because I am convinced that advancing this agenda will make NATO even

Today, NATO’s policy on Women, Peace and
Security reflects this understanding and focuses
on the principles of integration, inclusiveness and
integrity. Integration is about how to include gender
in all that NATO does. Inclusiveness promotes the
full and meaningful participation of women. Integrity
ensures that personnel uphold the highest standards
of behaviour, including commitments to protecting
women and girls from the scourge of conflict-related
sexual violence and other threats to their security.
In 2020, the groundwork was laid to update and
build upon existing guidelines on preventing and
responding to conflict-related sexual violence with
a new policy.

The NATO Headquarters in Brussels houses the Alliance’s International Staff and International Military Staff,
along with 30 Allied delegations and military representations, 19 partner missions and staff from several NATO
Agencies. It is the main forum for the discussions and consultations that shape NATO policy and practice.




The Headquarters in 2020
In 2020, NATO Headquarters has had to adapt to
the COVID-19 crisis. From the start of the outbreak,
NATO took steps to limit the spread of the virus and
minimise risk to personnel and the communities they
serve. Preventive measures were quickly put in place:

North Atlantic Council
The North Atlantic Council is the main political
decision-making body in NATO. It provides a
forum for consultation between Allies on all issues
affecting their defence and security. It brings
together high-level representatives from each Allied
country to discuss policy and operational questions
requiring collective decisions as well as to consult
and coordinate on topics of common interest and
concern.

Because decisions are made on the basis of
consensus, the policies agreed in the Council are
considered the expression of the collective will
of all NATO Allies. The Council is chaired by the
Secretary General and its decisions have the same
status, whether the meeting takes place during a
Summit of NATO Heads of State and Government or                      A security dog is tasked to sweep the conference room

NATO Funding
The costs of running NATO are funded through both
direct and indirect contributions by all 30 Allies.

Indirect contributions are by far the largest type
of contributions and include Allies’ participation in
NATO-led operations and missions.                           In 2020, my main task was to ensure

budgets and programme: the Civil Budget, the
Military Budget and the NATO Security Investment
Programme. A commonly agreed set of financial
regulations and an accounting framework are in
place to ensure the proper management of funds,
and corresponding financial statements are made
available to the public.

Each NATO military capability is financed through
a combination of common funding, joint funding,
multinational funding and national funding.
Participating nations, in cooperation with the NATO
Military Authorities, identify the requirements,
the priorities and the funding arrangements, and
NATO provides political and military oversight.
The common funding process is overseen by the
North Atlantic Council, managed by the Resource
Policy and Planning Board, and implemented by the
Budget Committee and the Investment Committee.

1	   The troop numbers reported reflect the overall presence in Afghanistan of
     each individual contributing nation. They are based on information provided
     directly by individual contributing nations and may include forces deployed in a
     support role for Resolute Support Mission. They should be taken as indicative
     as they change regularly, in accordance with the deployment procedures of the
     individual troop-contributing nations.

Defence Expenditure of NATO Countries (2013-2020)
NATO collects defence expenditure data from Allies on a regular basis and presents aggregates and subsets of this
information. Each Ally’s Ministry of Defence reports current and estimated future defence expenditure according to
an agreed definition of defence expenditure. The amounts represent payments by a national government actually
made, or to be made, during the course of the fiscal year to meet the needs of its armed forces, those of Allies or of
the Alliance. In the figures and tables that follow, NATO also uses economic and demographic information available
from the Directorate-General for Economic and Financial Affairs of the European Commission (DG-ECFIN), and the
Organisation for Economic Co operation and Development (OECD).
In view of differences between both these sources and national GDP forecasts, and also the definition of NATO
defence expenditure and national definitions, the figures shown in this report may diverge considerably from those
which are quoted by media, published by national authorities or given in national budgets. Equipment expenditure
includes expenditure on major equipment as well as on research and development devoted to major equipment.
Personnel expenditure includes pensions paid to retirees.
The cut-off date for information used in this report was 4 February 2021. Figures for 2020 are estimates.

Notes: Figures for 2020 are estimates.
*	 These Allies have national laws and political agreements which call for 2% of GDP to be spent on defence annually, consequently
   estimates are expected to change accordingly. For the past years, Allies' defence spending was based on the then available
   GDP data and Allies may, therefore, have met the 2% guideline when using those figures (In 2018, Lithuania met 2% using
   November 2018 OECD figures).

Notes: Figures for 2020 are estimates. The NATO Europe and Canada and NATO Total aggregates from 2017 onwards
include Montenegro, which became an Ally on 5 June 2017, and from 2020 onwards include North Macedonia, which
became an Ally on 27 March 2020.
*	 These Allies have national laws and political agreements which call for 2% of GDP to be spent on defence annually,
    consequently estimates are expected to change accordingly. For the past years, Allies' defence spending was based on
    the then available GDP data and Allies may, therefore, have met the 2% guideline when using those figures (In 2018,    133
    Lithuania met 2% using November 2018 OECD figures).

           Notes: Figures for 2020 are estimates. The NATO Europe and Canada and NATO Total aggregates from 2017 onwards
           include Montenegro, which became an Ally on 5 June 2017, and from 2020 onwards include North Macedonia, which
           became an Ally on 27 March 2020.
           *	 These Allies have national laws and political agreements which call for 2% of GDP to be spent on defence annually,

134            consequently estimates are expected to change accordingly. For the past years, Allies' defence spending was based on
               the then available GDP data and Allies may, therefore, have met the 2% guideline when using those figures (In 2018,
               Lithuania met 2% using November 2018 OECD figures).
