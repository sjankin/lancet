FOREWORD

Foreword
The 2018 Annual Report on the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises1 (hereafter
the “Guidelines”) set out in the Appendix describes activities undertaken to implement the
Guidelines during the period January 2018 to December 2018. In addition, this note
provides some developments up to March 2019. The Report was discussed by the Working
Party on Responsible Business Conduct (WPRBC) on 5-6 March 2019 and approved by
the Investment Committee by written procedure on 29 March 2019]. On the same dates,
the WPRBC also discussed the Draft Progress Report on National Contact Points (NCPs)
for the 2019 Ministerial Council Meeting, subsequently submitted to the Investment
Committee for transmission to the Council.
The 2018 Annual Report describes work on the implementation of the Guidelines and more
broadly on responsible business conduct (RBC), with a focus on the key work streams of
the WPRBC: support to the NCPs, design and implementation of due diligence tools in
global supply chains and policies to enable RBC, as well as outreach through the new
programme on Promoting Responsible Supply Chains in Asia and through the Global
Forum on RBC. The report also provides an overview of work on specific RBC issues, such
as child and forced labour, and incorporating a gender perspective into due diligence. It
also provides an insight into projects that consider the effectiveness of due diligence efforts,
such as assessing the alignment of industry initiatives and certification programmes with
OECD due diligence approaches, and measurement of due diligence impacts. Finally, it
looks at how direct and in-depth engagement with stakeholders, in particular business, trade
unions and civil society permeates the design and implementation of the work around RBC,
the Guidelines and due diligence, building on the OECD’s unique convening power and
experience in these areas. The report also looks at how Adherents are addressing the
growing demand for more policy coherence around RBC, and how the revised mandate of
the WPRBC will support those efforts.

INTRODUCTION AND EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Introduction and Executive summary
Key highlights on Responsible Business Conduct
In 2018, the implementation of the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises1 (the
Guidelines) saw a number of highlights. These concern the National Contact Points, which
received a record high of submissions of specific instances; the adoption of the OECD Due
Diligence Guidance for Responsible Business Conduct (RBC) during the OECD Council
Meeting at Ministerial level ; 2 the launch of the EU-ILO-OECD programme on Promoting
Responsible Supply Chains in Asia, and an unprecedented participation of stakeholders in
OECD activities and events related to RBC.
In 2018, the mandate of the Working Party on Responsible Business Conduct (WPRBC)
was renewed, for the first time since the creation of this subsidiary body of the Investment
Committee in 2012. The renewal process provided an opportunity to reflect on the mandate
and ensure the continued pertinence of the WPRBC for the next five years. Adjustments
made in the revised mandate included in particular: (i) a broader overarching objective of
the WPRBC, (ii) the inclusion of policy analysis and promoting policy coherence with
respect to RBC, (iii) more explicit inclusion of the OECD's work on due diligence and
engagement with the private sector, and (iv) the recognition of increased collaboration with
other OECD bodies and international organisations to promote international policy
coherence. The Chair since 2013, Mr Roel Nieuwenkamp, stepped down, and Ms Christine
Kaufmann was designated as the new Chair following an extensive, transparent and fair
process.

National Contact Points for Responsible Business Conduct
All countries adhering to the Guidelines (currently 48) have a National Contact Point
(NCP) in place. Of these, all but one submitted a report to the OECD Secretariat, providing
information on activities related to implementation of the Guidelines in 2018.
Since 2016, the OECD’s work in support of the NCPs was based on the implementation of
the Action Plan to Strengthen NCPs 2016-18. Under this Action Plan, all G7 countries have
either completed or have a peer review ongoing as at January 2019. An additional four
countries which received at least five specific instances have undergone a peer review
during the 2016-18 period. During the same period, four countries benefited from a tailored

The Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Business Conduct was approved by the Investment
Committee on 3 April 2018. It was subsequently made the subject of the Recommendation of the
Council on the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Business Conduct
[OECD/LEGAL/0443], adopted in the Ministerial Council Meeting on 30 May 2018.

capacity building mission to address areas for improvement. Two NCPs underwent
significant reviews as part of the process of accession to the OECD. An additional seven
NCPs have a peer review scheduled between 2019 and 2022. This leaves a total of 25 NCPs
having not yet committed to a peer review of which 15 are OECD Members.
Similarly, actions taken in the second track of activity to address coherence between NCPs
involved training on a wide range of topics including: confidentiality and campaigning,
mediation, RBC for institutional investors, due diligence in practice, etc. A set of papers
was also developed to address challenging topics and draw together NCP practice, these
addressed: NCP structures and activities; confidentiality and campaigning; NCP case
coordination; recommendations and determinations.
The third track of activity covered the development of tools to support NCPs in their work.
At the outset, an exercise was undertaken to make the OECD public specific instance
database as complete as possible. In addition, key tools were developed in partnership with
NCPs including a support tool for developing rules of procedure, the development of the
ONE Community space for NCPs to share updates and questions and the development of
key communication tools to support NCPs in their promotional activities.
In December 2018 the WPRBC discussed a second Action Plan to Strengthen NCPs for the
years 2019-2021. Building upon the lessons learnt from the implementation of the first
action plan, the proposed plan suggests new areas of focus to support the NCPs to better
meet their mandate and cooperate more effectively. As the diversity and complexity of
cases handled by NCPs continues to rise, the support of Adherent governments to ensure
the effective implementation of this action plan becomes all the more pressing.
The key, and most visible function of NCPs is that of handling complaints related to issues
related to the implementation of the Guidelines (“specific instances”). In 2018 NCPs closed
34 specific instances, which is in line with average numbers in previous years.3 Of the
eleven specific instances that went to mediation facilitated by the NCP, three resulted in
agreement and one resulted in agreement in a parallel process (36%). This represents a
substantial decrease from 2017, in which agreement was achieved in 83% of all cases which
went to mediation.
Although few agreements were reached, strong final statements were published for
concluded cases. In 2018 90% of available final statements included recommendations and
45% included determinations on whether the enterprises in question observed the
recommendations of the Guidelines. Some final statements also included interpretations of
the Guidelines. For example, in a case handled by the Dutch NCP regarding the relocation
of a 15th century tomb, in its final statement the NCP noted that the right to culture “should
be considered a human right under the OECD Guidelines.”
Furthermore, 77% of final statements included provision for monitoring and follow up,
doubling the rate reported in 2017. In 2018 follow up statements were published for eleven
3

Closed specific instances include both specific instances that have been concluded during the year
and those that were not accepted during the year. Specific instances concluded during the year are
those that the NCP found to merit further examination after the initial assessment and that have
subsequently been closed. For such specific instances the NCP will have offered its “good offices”
(e.g. mediation/conciliation) to both parties. Specific instances not accepted during the year are those
that the NCP found not to merit further examination and that have therefore been closed. Specific
instances that are in progress are those that are not yet closed. These include submissions received
by the NCP and under consideration, as well as those accepted by the NCP.

INTRODUCTION AND EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

specific instances. Some of them noted that recommendations issued by the NCP in cases
where there was originally no agreement, had been implemented in full. For example, in a
follow up statement issued by the Dutch NCP regarding a case involving due diligence in
the garment sector and the Rana Plaza collapse, the NCP found that the company in
question complied with all recommendations made by the NCP.
The high use of recommendations, determinations, and follow up provisions in final
statements suggests that, despite low rates of agreement through meditation NCPs made an
effort to establish a basis from which positive outcomes or agreements may be achieved
after the closing of a specific instance.
There was a record number of new submissions brought to NCPs in 2018. In total, 52 new
submissions were filed, compared to an annual average of 25 over the years 2000-2017.
New submissions covered a range of substantive issues and sectors. Two high profile
submissions concerning financial misconduct were submitted to the NCPs of the
Netherlands and jointly to the NCPs of Belgium and Luxembourg, concerning allegations
of tax evasion and money laundering respectively. There were also a few submissions
relating to organisations involved in social auditing and certification.
In 2018, 25 NCPs (52% of all NCPs) received specific instance submissions. This
represents an increase in historical rates and the rate reported in 2017 (38%). A high level
of submissions along with more distribution of case filings across NCPs suggests the
visibility of NCPs is increasing across different jurisdictions. To date 13 NCPs (Costa Rica,
Egypt, Estonia, Greece, Iceland, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Lithuania, Romania, Slovak
Republic, Slovenia, Tunisia and Ukraine) have not yet received a specific instance.
A total of 38 NCPs created a promotional plan for the Guidelines (compared to 33 in 2017),
and 41 NCPs either held or attended promotional events, (the same number as in 2017).
Most governments have made their NCP visible, e.g., via a dedicated website. Forty NCPs
published information on their website on procedures and explaining the specific instance
process (compared to 35 in 2017). There are currently two Adherent governments that do
not have a website in place on the Guidelines or the NCP, compared to four in 2017.
Furthermore, three NCPs did not attend the NCP meetings in either June or December (the
same number as in 2017) and one NCP did not report on its 2018 activities (compared to
three in 2017).
In 2018, the programme of NCP peer reviews continued with the finalisation of peer
reviews of the NCPs of Germany, Chile, the United States, Austria and Canada. The onsite visit for the United Kingdom took place in November 2018.

Due diligence to implement the Guidelines
To foster convergence and set out a common standard for due diligence that is relevant for
all types of companies operating in all countries and sectors of the economy the OECD
developed the Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Business Conduct. This Guidance
is the first government backed reference on due diligence which is relevant for all types of
companies and helps companies respond to the expectations set out in the Guidelines that
they carry out due diligence to identify, prevent and mitigate real and potential adverse
impacts across their operations and business relationships and to account for how those
impacts are addressed. The Guidance was made the subject of an OECD Recommendation
on the Guidance was adopted by Minsters on 30 May 2018 with the aim of providing

10  INTRODUCTION AND EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
support to enterprises by setting out practical, clear explanations of how to implement due
diligence as recommended in the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises. 4
Convergence around OECD standards was also strengthened through the release in April
2018 of a methodology to assess the alignment of industry-led programmes in the minerals
sector with the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals
from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas. This methodology was embedded into a
Delegated Act of the European Commission, which foresees a consultative role for the
OECD Secretariat in the EU’s recognition of industry schemes deemed compliant with EU
Regulation 2017/821. The same alignment assessment approach was launched in 2018 in
relation with the Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains in the Garment
and Footwear Sector. The draft assessment tool and methodology were launched in January
2018 and a pilot assessment was carried out with the Sustainable Apparel Coalition.
The past eight years of implementation of the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for
Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas have
resulted in increased awareness amongst stakeholders that companies have a responsibility
to cut the link between the mineral trade, serious human rights abuses and conflict.
However, despite anecdotal reports of various results, there appears to be a continued lack
of comprehensive and empirically-based evidence. To address this, the OECD Secretariat
in 2018 launched a project on developing a monitoring and evaluation framework to
measure results of the implementation of the OECD Minerals Guidance. The framework
will be finalised and pilot tested in 2019.
Among the tools being developed to assist companies to implement supply chain due
diligence, the OECD Secretariat is in the process of launching a Portal for Supply Chain
Risk Information (Risk Portal). The Risk Portal is envisioned to be a free-to-access website
that companies can use to gain an initial understanding of the risks in their supply chains
and to guide them towards further research resources. The primary purpose of the Risk
Portal is to provide information about risks that could lead those companies to ask further
questions and conduct a thorough review of what is alleged to have occurred. The pilot
version of the Risk Portal will cover 40 mineral supply chains and risks mentioned in the
Minerals Guidance. The pilot is expected to be ready to launch by the end of 2019. In the
long term, the Risk Portal scope can be expanded to include raw materials and risks in other
sectors.
The work on responsible agricultural supply chains includes collaboration with the Trade
and Agricultural Directorate (TAD) of the OECD as well as the Food and Agriculture
Organization of the United Nations (FAO). In February 2018, the OECD and FAO joined
efforts to launch a pilot project with agribusiness companies, including investors, food
manufacturers and retailers to promote the OECD-FAO Guidance for Responsible
Agricultural Supply Chains5 (OECD-FAO Guidance). The pilot aims to promote the
practical understanding and application of the OECD-FAO Guidance with enterprises.

INTRODUCTION AND EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

In 2018 the OECD deepened its activities under its implementation program of the Due
Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains in the Garment and Footwear Sector
with funding from the EU.6 Under this programme of work, the OECD continued to
convene stakeholders to engage on shared learnings - particularly around meaningful
engagement with workers in the due diligence process, enabling traceability, and
integrating a gender lens into due diligence - promote alignment with OECD
recommendations and facilitate multi-stakeholder collaboration in key markets. The
Guidance has been translated into French and in Chinese, as well as into Polish and
Japanese, in cooperation with the respective NCPs. In 2018, the OECD partnered with the
Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) to establish an industry platform on responsible
business conduct bringing together Indian manufacturing businesses and global brands
sourcing from India. It also signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU)7 with the
China National Textile and Apparel Council (CNTAC). Through this agreement, the
People’s Republic of China (China) committed to developing and implementing sector
guidance that is aligned to the OECD’s due diligence guidance, and the OECD committed
to providing technical support. This will have a significant impact in expanding the reach
of RBC instruments in the industry, as China accounts for a 40% market share in the global
trade in textiles.
The project Responsible Business Conduct (RBC) in the Financial Sector aims to support
practitioners in the financial sector implement the OECD Guidelines. Under this project,
the OECD is currently developing guidance to identify due diligence approaches for banks
to ensure they adequately avoid and address adverse environmental and social impacts
associated with their clients in general corporate lending and securities underwriting
transactions. Currently no broadly recognised standard on environmental and social due
diligence exists for these transactions although they represent the majority of financing
activity by banks. Based on feedback provided by advisory group members to the project
and other experts the OECD has developed a draft paper on Due Diligence for responsible
Business Conduct in General Corporate Lending and Securities Underwriting. The paper,
to be finalised in 2019, provides guidance on when enhanced due diligence can be triggered
in the context of general corporate lending and underwriting transactions, the role of banks
in stakeholder engagement and remediation, and how duties with respect to client
confidentially can be respected throughout the due diligence process.

Policy action to promote and enable Responsible Business Conduct
The trend to integrate expectations on RBC in domestic and international policy
commitments and regulations continued in 2018. This included specific and targeted policy
action by governments to promote and enable RBC among businesses, as well as
reinforcing their own commitments on RBC be it through adoption of new RBC-specific
initiatives or support for including RBC in related policy areas. The OECD Guidelines are
a core framework for these efforts, notably considering the practical nature of various
OECD Due Diligence guidance instruments, which are a key tool for reaching out to

12  INTRODUCTION AND EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
business, but also the role of NCPs in promoting coherence and providing a venue for
resolution of issues.
Elaborating a National Action Plan on Business and Human Rights (NAP) showed to be an
effective way to unify national efforts on RBC. As of January 2019, 22 countries have
adopted NAPs and four countries are in the process of developing one – all of which are
Adherents to the Guidelines.
Another way to build coherence around RBC is by mainstreaming RBC into other policy
areas. For example, RBC has been integrated as a core element of OECD Investment Policy
Reviews, including in the ongoing reviews of Thailand, Myanmar and Egypt.
OECD work on the integration of RBC in other policies and practices continued, with a
focus on areas where government operates as an economic actor, e.g., through public
procurement and development finance. A new work programme on Responsible Business
Conduct and Public Procurement was approved by the OECD Working Party on Leading
Practitioners of Public Procurement (LPP), and the Working Party on RBC end 2018; with
work planned for 2019-2020, pending funding.
A first regional programme to promote RBC was launched. The programme Promoting
Responsible Supply Chains in Asia, implemented by the OECD in partnership with the ILO
and funded and developed in co-operation with the EU, is expected to deepen engagement
with partners in Asia on RBC. The OECD is working with Japan as well as five nonMember economies (China, Thailand, Viet Nam, Philippines, and Myanmar) to provide
insight and analysis on RBC, boost capacity to implement RBC instruments, support RBC
policies, and raise awareness about the importance of RBC. The programme activities
started in January 2018 and will continue until 2020.
In 2018 the OECD also concluded negotiations on a new EU-funded project on Responsible
Business Conduct in Latin America and the Caribbean. The project, to be implemented
over a period of 4 years starting in 2019, together with the ILO and the United Nations
Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), foresees activities in the
seven Adherent countries in the region (two OECD Members: Chile and Mexico, and five
non-Members: Argentina Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, and Peru), as well as in two nonAdherent countries (Ecuador and Panama).
The regional programmes in Asia and Latin America are important avenues to promote
RBC globally and increase the outreach of the Guidelines and due diligence guidance
instruments. They provide a vehicle to strengthen alignment across government policies
relevant for RBC in the countries targeted by the projects. At the same time, the projects
provide an opportunity to strengthen coherence across the three pillars of the OECD’s work
on the Guidelines and on RBC more broadly: providing guidance to companies on how to
do due diligence across supply chains; supporting governments in ensuring an enabling
environment for RBC, and – in the case of Adherent countries - strengthening the
functioning of NCPs.

Stakeholder engagement
Stakeholder engagement is a defining characteristic of RBC as set out in the Guidelines.
Stakeholders, including business, trade unions and civil society organisation, have played
a critical role in drawing attention to key issues to be considered e.g. in the development
and implementation of due diligence guidance, bringing specific instances to the NCP
system, and in promoting the Guidelines.

INTRODUCTION AND EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Through engagement with each of these stakeholder groups, the OECD brings relevant and
cutting-edge perspectives, rooted in real-world experience, to advising governments on
RBC issues and in developing standards and tools to promote RBC globally. One key
avenue for engagement with stakeholders is through consultation with BIAC, TUAC and
OECD Watch during meetings of the WPRBC and the NCP Network. In addition, all sector
related guidance, as well as the 2018 OECD Due Diligence Guidance for RBC, were
developed in close consultation with multi-stakeholder advisory groups, which also
accompany the implementation of the guidance, once adopted. Pilot projects with a small
group of companies in a sector help share experience on the implementation of due
diligence in a specific sector. In 2018, a pilot project was launched to work with companies
on the implementation of the OECD-FAO Guidance for agricultural supply chains.
Another important way for OECD to engage with stakeholders is through its various events,
notably the Global Forum on Responsible Business Conduct, the Forum on Responsible
Minerals Supply Chains, and the Forum on Due Diligence in the Garment and Footwear
Sectors, which are held annually and contribute significantly to promoting the OECD
Guidelines and due diligence guidance, and to supporting their uptake and implementation.

Due Diligence Guidance for RBC:
A new milestone for implementation of the Guidelines
In June 2018, the OECD Council adopted the Recommendation of the Council on the
OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Business Conduct8 (Guidance) ] and all
Adherents to the Guidelines committed to promote its use.9 Adherents have now also
adopted a three-year plan to support the implementation of the Guidance. Under the
implementation plan, the Guidance will be translated into multiple languages (versions in
Spanish, German, Japanese, Thai, Arabic and others are already in place or in preparation),
training materials are being developed, and tools to support the application of due diligence
in specific sectors (e.g. construction), or on specific issues (e.g. gender, and the sustainable
development goals) are in preparation. At its March 2019 meeting, the WPRBC held its
first workshop on RBC and Gender, which helped analyse in more depth the Guidance’s
advice on how to integrate a gender lens in supply chains and provide input into the United
Nations (UN) Working Group on Business and Human Rights’ call for inputs on a new
guidance on gender.
The adoption of the Guidance was the culmination of a two year-long process of research
and consultations with key stakeholders, including governments, business, trade unions,
civil society, experts from other international organisations, academia, etc., which led to a
practical and easy-to-understand tool for companies of all sizes, operating in any sector and
geography. Importantly, the Guidance constitutes an international standard for supply chain
due diligence for companies, which serves to implement the due diligence expectations of
international instruments such as the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human
Rights and the International Labour Organization (ILO) Tripartite Declaration of Principles
Concerning Multinational Enterprises and Social Policy, as well as domestic legislation
such as the French law on Duty of Vigilance. The strong call by the UN Working Group

14  INTRODUCTION AND EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
on Business and Human Rights for companies to use the OECD Guidance as a means to
implement the UN Guiding Principles attests to its wide relevance and responds to
businesses’ demand to address the proliferation of standards around responsible business
conduct.
The development of the Guidance built on the extensive expertise acquired in the design
and implementation of sector-specific programmes led by the OECD, in the minerals,
extractives, agriculture, garment and footwear, as well as the financial sectors. The
pertinence and usefulness of these guidances is reflected, inter alia, in their increasing
uptake by business and industry groups. One crucial factor for the success of these
programmes is the continuous engagement with, and support provided to companies by the
OECD, to help them understand how to operationalise due diligence expectations, address
common challenges, and exchange experiences on lessons learnt regarding implementation
and opportunities to work together to address problems.

Direct engagement with stakeholders: A key feature of OECD’s work on RBC
Strong, direct engagement with companies is a distinguishing feature of the OECD’s work
on RBC. All sector guidance instruments have been developed with the active participation
of multi-stakeholder advisory groups, which promotes buy-in and provides a solid basis for
the acceptance of the guidance tools by a comprehensive set of stakeholders, in particular
business. Engagement with business in the implementation of guidance tools is particularly
important, as it provides direct feedback on the relevance of the guidances and tools.
The engagement with business developed in the context of work on RBC is also helpful in
other areas of work of the OECD, and there are growing linkages between, for example,
work on RBC and the environment (e.g. climate change and chemicals in the context of
garment supply chains, biodiversity, etc.). RBC also contributes to the advancement of the
OECD Framework for Policy Action on Inclusive Growth, as the OECD tools on RBC can
help both governments and business work together to drive more inclusive and sustainable
trade and investment across countries and supply chains.
This engagement with business keeps growing, as reflected in the increasing number of
companies attending OECD events on RBC. For example, in 2018 the Forum on
Responsible Mineral Supply Chains, attracted over 900 participants, of which over 60%
were company representatives; the 2018 Forum on Due Diligence in the Garment and
Footwear Sector had over 40% company participation (numbers which increased in the
February 2019 edition with 50% of participants from the private sector), and the Global
Forum on RBC, which had ca 50% company participation, among over 750 participants.

Strengthening outreach to new partners: RBC in Asia and Latin America
This approach of engaging directly with business and providing advice and training is a
strong value-add of the European Union (EU)-funded project on Promoting Responsible
Supply Chains in Asia, implemented together with the ILO. Under this three-year project,
which started in 2018, a range of training and capacity building events targeting companies
have been held in all six countries in the project10, including, for example, workshops with
companies in the electronics sector in China and Japan, in seafood supply chains in Viet
Nam, agri-businesses in the Philippines, and with state-owned enterprises and institutional

INTRODUCTION AND EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

investors in Thailand. A pilot project on responsible agricultural supply chains in Southeast
Asia will soon be launched involving companies in Myanmar, Thailand, Viet Nam and the
Philippines. A pilot on responsible garment and footwear will also be undertaken with
companies in China and Viet Nam.
Engagement in Asia is not only with business, but also with policy makers, and several
activities support enhancing the policy environment to enable RBC. In Thailand, for
example, this is done in the framework of the OECD-Thailand Country Programme and in
the context of the ongoing Investment Policy Review of Thailand.11 The 7th Global Forum
on Responsible Business Conduct, which will be held in Bangkok on 12-13 June 2019 as
part of the Bangkok Business and Human Rights Week, will provide an opportunity to
highlight the strength of OECD instruments on RBC and initiatives undertaken by Adherent
governments to promote their implementation. Considering Thailand’s chairmanship of
ASEAN this year, the work on RBC could usefully contribute to the ASEAN agenda and
its current focus on sustainability.
Capacity building on RBC and due diligence, as well as supporting the development of an
enabling environment for RBC, is also a key component of the project on RBC in Latin
America and the Caribbean (LAC), which was launched in January 2019 and will benefit
nine countries, seven of them Adherents to the Guidelines, and the related
Recommendations on due diligence.12 Another important element of the LAC project is
strengthening the NCPs in Adherent countries. Work has already started to identify specific
needs and areas for improvement of the seven NCPs.

A new Action Plan to strengthen National Contact Points
Strengthening NCPs and providing support to the NCPs has been an ongoing effort by both
Adherent governments and the Secretariat, especially since the review of the Guidelines in
2011. A major step was the adoption of the Action Plan to Strengthen National Contact
Points (2016-18). This Action Plan has delivered concrete and positive outcomes and
addressed a wide range of topics of central importance to NCPs, including: confidentiality
and campaigning, mediation, RBC for institutional investors, due diligence in practice,
etc.13 See also the Progress Report on National Contact Points for Responsible Business
Conduct for the 2019 MCM.
One notable indicator of success is that at the end of 2018, for the first time, all Adherent
governments had an NCP in place and 47 of 48 submitted their annual report to the OECD.
Moreover, 2018 also saw the highest number of cases submitted to NCPs in one year, a
total of 52 cases. Less encouraging is that fact that only three out of eleven cases that went
to mediation reached agreement between the parties. On the other hand, although few

The same is likely to be the case in Viet Nam, following Council’s agreement in February 2019
to invite Viet Nam, alongside Egypt, to engage in a country programme and the conclusion by the
ERC in February 2019 to start discussing a country programme with Viet Nam.

This four-year project, funded by the EU, is being carried out by the OECD, together with the
ILO and the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR).
13

A set of papers was also developed to draw together NCP practice, these focused on: NCP
structures and activities; confidentiality and campaigning; NCP case coordination;
recommendations and determinations.

16  INTRODUCTION AND EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
agreements were reached, strong final statements were published for concluded cases.14 In
2018, 90% of available final statements included recommendations and 45% included
determinations on whether the enterprises in question observed the recommendations of
the Guidelines.
The increasing complexity of cases submitted to NCPs continues to be a challenge, and
some governments changed the structure of their NCPs in 2018, to, among other things,
increase their capacity to better promote the Guidelines and handle cases. Among the NCPs
with reinforced structures is that of Australia, which was also the first Adherent to receive
a substantiated submission regarding the handling of a case, and was also the first Adherent
government which carried out an independent review of its NCP.
The second Action Plan to Strengthen NCPs (2019-2021) has three tracks of activity which
mirror the first Action Plan (peer reviews and capacity building; building functional
equivalence; and building and improving tools). A new fourth track of activity was added
to the Action Plan to cover promoting policy coherence by NCPs.
Since the last revision of the Guidelines there have been significant changes in a number
of adhering governments, leading to better functioning NCPs, in particular those based in
countries with high outward and inward investment. This is to be welcomed. Nevertheless,
many NCPs today still face challenges since they are not adequately resourced or staffed
to be able to carry out their mandate. Cases coming before NCPs are only set to increase in
complexity and having access to the appropriate expertise is critical for the overall
functioning of these agencies. In order for the entire community of NCPs to meet the
expectations set out by their mandate, appropriate government support, resources and
institutional arrangements are required so that their work can be carried out in a way that
demonstrates the full potential of these unique agencies for responsible business conduct.

Promoting implementation of the Guidelines through regulation
and policy coherence
While the Guidelines and related due diligence instruments are non-binding tools,
governments have, over the years, adopted legislation embedding many of the
recommendations of the Guidelines and making them mandatory. One example is
disclosure of non-financial information, which in some countries is now mandatory. A
number of countries have also adopted legislation which makes reporting on due diligence
mandatory. Following the adoption of the UK’s Modern Slavery Act in 2016, Australia’s
Modern Slavery Act entered into force in 2019. France’s 2017 Law on the duty of
vigilance15 makes the establishment of a due diligence plan by large companies mandatory,
and similar initiatives are underway, e.g., in Switzerland. On 7 March 2019 the EU came

Closed specific instances include both specific instances that have been concluded during the year
and those that were not accepted during the year. Specific instances concluded during the year are
those that the NCP found to merit further examination after the initial assessment and that have
subsequently been closed. For such specific instances the NCP will have offered its “good offices”
(e.g. mediation/conciliation) to both parties. Specific instances not accepted during the year are those
that the NCP found not to merit further examination and that have therefore been closed. Specific
instances that are in progress are those that are not yet closed. These include submissions received
by the NCP and under consideration, as well as those accepted by the NCP.

INTRODUCTION AND EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

to a provisional political agreement on a Regulation for Sustainable Disclosure by EU
Investors which will call on financial market participants and financial advisors to integrate
consideration of environmental, social or governance (ESG) risks and opportunities in their
processes and to report on their due diligence policies. It encourages financial market
participants to take into account due diligence guidance for responsible business conduct
developed by the OECD.
In addition to regulatory incentives, governments are also expected to lead by example, by
including RBC criteria across policies in a coherent manner, and ensuring that expenditure
of public funds and engagement with the private sector also takes RBC criteria into account.
For example, a growing number of governments are now incorporating RBC into public
procurement policies and practices. The joint project between the WPRBC and the
Working Party on Leading Practitioners of Public Procurement (LPP) agreed to in 2018
will provide support to governments in this endeavour.
One area of significant public spending and public-private engagement is that of
infrastructure. The growing demand for infrastructure investment, in particular in transport,
energy and connectivity, has also increased calls for ensuring that infrastructure design and
use meets RBC standards. An indicator for the important role of RBC in infrastructure
development is the high number of NCP cases related to this issue. This role has also
become evident in the OECD’s Horizontal Project on Quality Infrastructure, and there is
growing demand for guidance on how best to integrate the recommendations of the
Guidelines and due diligence guidance, e.g. in relation to stakeholder engagement, human
rights, labour rights and environmental protection into infrastructure development and
implementation. The focus of the Japanese G20 Presidency on quality infrastructure is a
good opportunity to raise the profile of the Guidelines and OECD RBC standards among
G20 partners.
Other areas where policy coherence for RBC is important are development finance, export
credits, trade and investment, corporate governance and taxation policies. Adherents are
increasingly using these different policy areas, as well as National Action Plans on Business
and Human Rights, to promote and incentivise responsible corporate behaviour. The
Recommendation of the Council on the Policy Framework for Investment
[OECD/LEGAL/0412] is a useful reference for governments for designing and
implementing a strong RBC policy framework.16 With the approval of the new mandate of
the WPRBC on 27 November 2018 by the Investment Committee, the objective of
promoting national and international policy coherence on RBC has for the first time been
explicitly recognised in the WPRBC mandate. Through the WPRBC, the OECD can play
an important role in responding to the need for alignment and coordination across
government action on RBC. The OECD’s value added is unique in this regard, as it covers
a wide range of policy areas where technical experts from governments work together to
share experiences and set international standards relating to economic policies that have a
bearing on RBC.

Proposed Action
In light of the preceding, the Secretary-General invites the Council to adopt the following
draft conclusions:

1. NATIONAL CONTACT POINTS FOR RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS CONDUCT

Chapter 1.
National Contact Points for Responsible Business Conduct

1.1. Introduction
Governments adhering to the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises (the
Guidelines) are required to set up a National Contact Point (NCP) to further the
implementation of the Guidelines.1 NCPs have two main functions: 1) to promote the
Guidelines and handle enquiries, which means that NCPs ensure that the Guidelines and
the role of the NCP are known among relevant stakeholders and across government
agencies; and 2) provide a grievance mechanism to resolve cases ("specific instances")
relating to non-observance of the recommendations of the Guidelines.2 The Council
Recommendations relating to the due diligence guidance tools provide that NCPs, should
contribute to their dissemination and active use by enterprises.3
This unique implementation mechanism distinguishes the Guidelines from other
international RBC instruments and continues to play a critical role in ensuring that
commitments under the Guidelines are met. There are currently 48 Adherent countries, and,
for the first time in 2018, NCPs are in place in all Adherent countries.

1.2. Overview of specific instances handled in 2018
Handling specific instances is a core pillar of the mandate of NCPs and a key feature of
what makes the Guidelines unique. The Procedural Guidance provides that “NCP[s] will
offer a forum for discussion and assist the business community, worker organisations, other
non-governmental organisations, and other interested parties concerned to deal with […]
issues raised […].”4 This mechanism has been part of the mandate of NCPs since the 2000
review of the Guidelines. Since 2000, the NCPs have handled over 425 specific instances.
In 2018, NCPs closed 34 specific instances; and 52 new specific instances were submitted.
Closed specific instances include those submitted during and prior to 2018. The sections

For example, the 2018 Recommendation of the Council on the Due Diligence Guidance for
Responsible Business Conduct recommends “that Adherents and where relevant their NCPs, with
the support of the OECD Secretariat, ensure the widest possible dissemination of the Guidance and
its active use by enterprises, as well as promote the use of the Guidance as a resource for stakeholders
such as industry associations, trade unions, civil society organisations, multi-stakeholder initiatives,
and sector-initiatives, and regularly report to the Investment Committee on any monitoring,
dissemination and implementation activities.”

below give an overview of outcomes of closed specific instances and trends identified for
new specific instances submitted.

Box 1.1. Terminology for the status of specific instances

Specific instances closed during the year include both specific instances that have been
concluded during the year and those that were not accepted during the year.
1. Specific instances concluded during the year are those that the NCP found to merit
further examination after the initial assessment and that have subsequently been
closed. For such specific instances the NCP will have offered its “good offices”
(e.g. mediation/conciliation) to both parties.
2. Specific instances not accepted during the year are those that the NCP found not
to merit further examination and that have therefore been closed.
Specific instances that are in progress are those that are not yet closed. These include
submissions received by the NCP and under consideration, as well as those accepted by
the NCP.

1.2.1. Key outcomes of specific instances
A total of 34 specific instances were closed: 21 that were already in progress as of January
2018 and 13 new ones which were submitted during 2018. Table 1.2 provides an overview
of closed specific instances in 2018. Closed specific instances refers both to concluded
cases and those that are not accepted for further examination (see Box 1.1). Of the specific
instances in progress as of January 2018, seven were submitted prior to 2017.
Out of the 34 specific instances closed in 2018, 13 were concluded (38%) and 20 were not
accepted (59%). One additional specific instance was withdrawn by the submitter prior to
the initial assessment by the NCP (3%).
Of the 13 concluded specific instances, eleven underwent mediation which in 3 cases
resulted in some form of agreement between the parties through the NCP process5 and 1
which resulted in some form of agreement between the parties in parallel to the NCP
process. Seven specific instances that went to mediation did not result in agreement despite
the engagement of both parties in the process.
For the remaining two concluded specific instances no mediation took place as companies
in question declined to participate.6

“Some form of agreement” means that the parties either reached full or partial agreement on the
issues raised in the complaint or ways forward

Agreement was reached in 4 specific instances, 3 within the NCP process and another in
parallel to the specific instance procedure accounting for 31% of all concluded cases (see
Figure 1.1) and 36% of all cases where mediation occurred. This is a decrease from 2017
where parties reached an agreement in eight specific instances through the NCP and in
another two in parallel to the specific instance procedure, accounting for 83% of all
concluded specific instances where mediation occurred (12 in total). In addition, in one
specific instance which was not formally accepted the NCP nevertheless provided
mediation resulting in agreement between the parties (see Box 1.2).

Corning Inc. and the Workers Union of Corning Inc.: On 17 August 2017, the Workers’
Union of Corning Inc. submitted a specific instance with the Korean NCP alleging that
Corning Inc. did not respect the Employment and Industrial Relations chapter of the
Guidelines by not facilitating collective bargaining. The NCP organised a mediation with
a member of the NCP and two independent experts. The mediation resulted in an agreement
between the parties on all of the issues tabled for discussion including: deduction of union
dues, the retroactive application of wage increases, workers’ leave and space for a union
office. This was the first mediation led by the NCP of Korea resulting in full agreement
between the parties.
Nuon Energy N.V. and/or Nuon Wind Development B.V. (Nuon), and Stichting Hou
Friesland Mooi: On 12 December 2017, Stichting Hou Friesland Mooi (HFM) submitted
a specific instance to the Dutch National Contact Point. Alleging non-observance of the
Human Rights and Environment chapters of the Guidelines related to the scaling up of an
existing wind farm by Nuon, a Dutch utility company. The NCP organised a mediation
which resulted in agreement on how stakeholders would be engaged in the next phase of
the project by Nuon. The NCP noted it would follow up within one year to assess
implementation of the agreement.

Environmental issues in Spain concerning a Spanish multinational energy supplier
and an individual: On 31 July 2017, an individual filed a claim with the Spanish NCP
regarding a potential breach of the Guidelines by a Spanish multinational energy supplier.
The submitter alleged that the company had not acted in line with the Guidelines in relation
to the maintenance work on a farm owned by the claimant. The NCP did not formally
accept the submission due to an internal assessment that the issues raised were outside the
mandate of the NCP. The NCP nevertheless mediated a dialogue between the parties
resulting in an agreement between the parties under which company responded to all the
requests of the submitter.

1.2.3. Type of companies involved in specific instances
The specific instances closed in 2018 involved primarily large enterprises (defined as
companies employing over 250 employees), accounting for 23 (68%) of all closed specific
instances.7 Information is unavailable with respect to the size of the company involved in
8 specific instances (24%), as some final statements do not identify the name of the
enterprises involved.
Companies involved in specific instances were in nearly equal parts publically listed entities
representing 11 (33%) of all closed specific instances, and privately held companies also
representing 12 (35%). Two of the specific instances involved state-owned enterprises
(SOEs) and 1 involved a trade union. Information on the identity of 8 (24%) of the companies
is unavailable (see Figure 1.2). This year saw a rise in cases involving privately owned
companies compared to publically listed companies which represented the majority in 2017.

1.2.4. Final statements
The Procedural Guidance provides that NCPs will "at the conclusion of the [specific
instance] procedures and after consultation with the parties involved, make the results of
procedures publically available […]"9. In particular, the Commentary on the
Implementation Procedures of the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises
provides that when the NCP "decides that the issues raised in the specific instance do not
merit further consideration, it will make a statement publicly available after consultations
with the parties involved”10 and “if the parties fail to reach agreement or if the NCP finds
that one or more of the parties to the specific instance is unwilling to engage or to participate
in good faith the NCP will make recommendations as appropriate in the public
statement.”11 Determinations (to indicate that a company has or has not observed the
recommendations of the Guidelines) can also be made by NCPs.
Statements by the NCP constitute an important tool to support the effectiveness if the
Guidelines and enhance transparency, accountability and visibility of NCPs. Substantiated
decisions, recommendations and determinations, by the NCP can help companies and
stakeholders better understand the Guidelines and what steps, actions, policy measures they
can take to fully observe them. Some NCPs have also shared that, in certain contexts, the

prospect of the NCP issuing a determination could be a disincentive for companies to
engage with the NCP.
Final statements were published for 25 (74%) specific instances that were closed in 2018.
Out of 9 specific instances for which final statements were not published 7 were not
accepted for further examination during the initial assessment stage.
Ten of the 11 final statements published for concluded cases included recommendations
(91%).12 This is an increase from 2017 where 70% of final statements published for
concluded cases included recommendations. Recommendations are especially useful in
cases where parties have not been able to engage or reach agreement (see Box 1.3).
Box 1.3. Examples of recommendations in NCP final statements

Australian and New Zealand Banking Group Limited (ANZ Group) and Equitable
Cambodia (EC) and Inclusive Development International (IDI): On 7 October 2014 a specific
instance was submitted to the NCP of Australia by ED and IDI regarding ANZ’s involvement
with Phnom Penh Sugar (PPS), the developer of a sugar plantation and refinery project in
Cambodia. The project is alleged to have forcibly displaced 681 families and dispossessed them
of their land and productive resources. Mediation was concluded in December 2015, as the parties
were unable to reach an agreement. In its final statement the NCP concluded that in this case “it
is difficult to reconcile ANZ’s decision to take on PPS as a client with its own internal policies
and procedures—which appear to accord with the OECD Guidelines—as the potential risks
associated with this decision would likely have been readily apparent.” The NCP also included a
range of recommendations including strengthening the application of its due diligence
arrangements and establishing a grievance resolution mechanism.
Vinci and Vinci Airports and ITUC in Cambodia: On 27 July 2017, the French NCP received
a specific instance submitted by two labour confederations regarding the activities of the
Cambodian subsidiary of Vinci Airports in Cambodia. The facts concerned a labour dispute that
started in 2012 when Cambodia Airports introduced a new method of organising work under a
“multi-tasking scheme”. The NCP determined that with respect to many of the issues raised Vinci
had respected the recommendations of the Guidelines. However in its final statement it included
eight recommendations targeted at strengthening Vinci’s due diligence process and engagement
with workers. It will follow up on the implementation of its recommendations within one year.
Drummond Ltd. and the National Trade Union of Diseased and Disabled Workers of the
Mining Sector (SINTRADEM); the General Federation of Labor Cesar’s Office (CGT
Cesar) and the General Confederation of Labor Colombia (CGT Colombia): On 29 July
2016, the Colombian NCP received a submission by the trade unions alleging that Drummond, a
US coal company, had violated the right to freedom of association and collective bargaining of
unionized workers, and of the worker’s human rights (specifically, the right to health). The NCP
organised a series of mediation meetings which failed to result in agreement between the parties.
In its final statement the NCP included several detailed recommendations to both parties
including strengthening communication channels that follow-up on diseased and disabled worker
cases, and promoting the continuation of a ‘self-care at work’ program, in order to advance in the
construction of a safety oriented culture within the company.

Determinations of whether an enterprise observed or did not observe the Guidelines were
included in 5 final statements (45% of all final statements published for concluded cases
and 20% of all final statements published in 2018).13 These included both determinations
that a company did not observe the Guidelines as well as determinations that the Guidelines
had been observed (see Box 1.4).
Box 1.4. Examples of determinations in NCP final statements

FIVAS, the Initiative to Keep Hasankeyf Alive and Hasankeyf Matters vs Bresser: On
28 July 2017, three NGOs jointly submitted a specific instance to the Dutch NCP. In their
submission, they noted that Bresser, an SME specialised in the relocation and maintenance
of buildings and structures, failed to work with the local population before relocating an
ancient tomb, in violation of the community’s right to cultural heritage. All parties agreed
to engage in mediation facilitated by the Dutch NCP. On 20 August 2018, the Dutch NCP
issued a final statement concluding that Bresser did not “satisfy the due diligence criteria
of the OECD Guidelines,” and that the right to culture “should be considered a human right
under the OECD Guidelines.” This was the first specific instance to recognise cultural
rights as human rights.
DNO ASA and Industri Energi: On 8 November 2016, the Norwegian trade union
Industri Energi filed a submission concerning the Norwegian company DNO ASA. The
key issue in the submission was an alleged lack of prior notice and consultation between
DNO and the employee representatives in Yemen in connection with collective dismissals
and suspension of production in the war-like situation that prevailed in 2015. The NCP
conducted a mediation between the parties which failed to produce an agreement. In its
final statement for the specific instance the NCP concludes that DNO has not met the
expectations expressed in the Guidelines with respect to prior notice and consultation of
employees during operation changes to an enterprise. It recommended that DNO in future
should carry out risk-based due diligence and enhance the transparency of its guidelines
and procedures for responsible business conduct.

1.2.5. Follow-up
Following up on recommendations in final statements can be a valuable exercise in
ensuring agreements reached through specific instance proceedings are implemented and
in tracking whether recommendations are being implemented (see Box 1.5). In 2018, the
NCPs of Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, the Netherlands, Spain, Switzerland
and the United Kingdom issued follow-up statements relating to 12 specific instances. In
addition, plans for follow up or monitoring of recommendations was included in final
statements for 10 out of 13 concluded specific instances (77%). The rate of references to
follow-up in final statements doubled from that reported in 2017 (35%). Follow-up has
been identified as a valuable activity by parties to specific instances and in some situations
has resulted in stronger relationships between the parties and additional positive outcomes.
Further analysis on the variety of approaches to follow-up and its impact is ongoing.

Box 1.5. Follow-up in NCP specific instances

PWT Group and Clean Clothes Campaign Denmark and Active Consumers: On 12
December 2014, the NGOs Clean Clothes Campaign Denmark and Active Consumers
submitted a specific instance to the Danish NCP alleging that PWT Group had failed to carry
out due diligence in relation to its supplier, the textile manufacturer New Wave Style Ltd. which
was located in the Rana Plaza. A final statement for the specific instance was issued on 7
October 2016 in which the NCP included a series of recommendations and noted it would
follow up within one year. A follow-up statement was issued 17 January 2018. In it the NCP
concluded that PWT has complied with all recommendations issued including through making
significant changes to its management and risk management systems to implement the
Guidelines in its own operations and vis-à-vis its suppliers; revising its CSR policy and
engaging systematically in implementing its code of conduct among its suppliers.
Andritz Hydro GmbH and Finance and Trade Watch Austria In April 2014, the Austrian
NCP received a submission from nine NGOs related to ANDRITZ HYRO’s supply of
hydropower-turbines and its role in the construction and operation of the Xayaburi hydropower
project in Lao People's Democratic Republic. After a mediation led by the NCP, the parties
came to an agreement in which ANDRITZ HYRO committed to develop policies and
procedures in relation to the implementation of human rights and environmental standards and
to exchange information and involve relevant stakeholder groups in the process. The NCP
issued a follow up statement in October 2018 and noted that since February 2018 four followup meetings have taken place to discuss mitigate efforts with respect to the Xayaburi project.
ANDRITZ HYRO has also engaged with the parties and expert and NGOs to develop a new
code of conduct based on international principles which will be valid for all companies in the
ANDRITZ GROUP.

1.2.6. Specific instances not accepted for further examination
As noted above 20 specific instances, 59% of specific instances closed in 2018 were not
accepted for further examination. This rate exceeds historical rates of non-acceptance
which have been between 25% and 40% since 2001.14 One reason for the increased rate of
non-acceptance may be linked to increase reporting of specific instances which fall outside
the mandate of the NCP.15
The main reason for not accepting specific instances in 2018 was that the NCP considered
that it was not the appropriate entity to consider the submission, 9 specific instances (37%).
The second most prevalent reason, in 5 specific instances, (26%) was that the NCP
concluded that considering the submission would not further the purpose or effectiveness
of the Guidelines. This differs from 2017 during which a lack of materiality or
substantiation was the leading reason for rejection of submissions (see Figure 1.3).

For example in 2018 Denmark reported 8 specific instances not accepted for further examination.
Many of these were rejected within a few weeks based on the fact that the issues raised fell outside
the scope of the Guidelines and were referred to other agencies.

1.2.7. Duration of procedures
The Commentary on the Implementation Procedures of the OECD Guidelines for
Multinational Enterprises provides an indicative timeframe of three months for completing
the initial assessment16. Of the 34 specific instances closed in 2018, an initial assessment
was completed within three months in only 9 cases (26%). In 12 specific instances (35%)
the initial assessment took between 3-6 months. In 4 specific instances (12%) it exceed one
year. NCPs have identified this timeframe as a challenge. On the other hand, stakeholders
have identified delays in the assessment as a shortcoming of the mechanism and noted that
completing this process sooner would make the system more impactful and effective.
The Commentary on the Implementation Procedures of the OECD Guidelines for
Multinational Enterprises provides that “[a]s a general principle, NCPs should strive to
conclude the procedure within 12 months from receipt of the specific instance. It is
recognised that this timeframe may need to be extended if circumstances warrant it, such
as when the issues arise in a non-adhering country.”17 In most specific instances closed in
2018, 26 (76%) proceedings were closed within a year. In 8 specific instances (24%),
proceedings lasted for over a year, and in 3 of these cases they lasted several years. In some
cases delays reflect extended follow-up activities, challenges in handling complex and
transnational issues, or multiple mediation or dialogue sessions, sometimes requested by
parties to specific instances. In some cases delays reflect capacity issues at the level of the
NCP. In 2018 one case was withdrawn by the submitter because it had been originally
submitted in 2011. 18

The Commentary on the Implementation Procedures of the OECD Guidelines for
Multinational Enterprises provides that the NCP of the host country should consult with
the NCP of the home country in its efforts to assist the parties in resolving the issues.19 It
also provides that when issues arise from an enterprise’s activity that takes place in several
Adherent countries or from the activity of a group of enterprises organised as a consortium,
joint venture or similar form, based in different Adherent countries, the lead NCP should
consult with other NCPs.20 15 specific instances, 29% of those submitted in 2018, are being
handled with the help of supporting NCPs. This is higher than in 2017 where 18% of
specific instances filed were being handled with the help of a supporting NCP.

1.3.1. Specific instances by industry sectors
The most prevalent sectors referenced in specific instances submitted in 2018 were mining
and quarrying, followed by manufacturing, agriculture and the financial sector. (See Figure
1.6). This is in line with broad historic trends but represents a decrease in submission
involving the financial sector which for the period of 2015-2017 most represented sector,
accounting for approximately 20% of new submissions every year. However, in 2018
several submissions involving financial misconduct were filed (see Box 1.6).

1.3.2. Chapters of the Guidelines cited in specific instances
The chapter on General Policies was the most frequently referenced chapter in 2018, 32 of
the specific instances submitted (63%). This can be partly attributed to the fact that the due
diligence expectation on companies is included in the chapter on General Policies and
issues around due diligence processes often underpin adverse environmental and social
impacts. Some submissions raised issues related to the due diligence of organisations
whose mandate involves promoting strong social and environmental performance of
companies (see Box 1.6).
The second most frequently cited chapter was that on Employment and Industrial Relations
followed by the chapter on Human Rights. This is broadly in line with trends in 2017 and
2016. In 2018 all chapters of the Guidelines were cited at least once in new submissions.
This is different from previous years where certain chapters, notably the chapter on
Competition, were not referenced in any new submissions 21 (see Figure 1.7).

21

The Chapter on Competition was not referenced in specific instances submitted in 2017, 2016 or

Box 1.6. Specific instances involving social auditors and certification organisations

TÜV Rheinland AG et al. and European Center for Constitutional and Human Rights
ECCHR et al.: In June 2018, the German NCP published its final statement regarding
issues brought by ECCHR concerning a social audit by TÜV India of Phantom Apparel
Ltd in Dhaka, Bangladesh in June 2012. The submitters alleged that TUV India – a
subsidiary of TÜV Rheinland – did not comply with the Guidelines in conducting the social
audit with regards thoroughly verifying whether Phantom was engaged in human rights
abuses, and the safety in its factory (Rana Plaza). The NCP offered mediation however the
parties were not able to reach a common understanding on how social audits conducted by
private sector companies should be conducted and improved. In its final statement, the
NCP recommends that parties continue to engage on the subject matter and asked both
parties to report back within one year.
Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) and TUK Indonesia: On 25 January 2018,
the NGO Transformation for Justice (TuK Indonesia) submitted a specific instance to the
Swiss NCP on behalf of communities in West Kalimantan, Indonesia. The submission
concerns an unsolved land conflict in Indonesia, which is being dealt by the RSPO proper
complaint mechanism. The submitting party asks the Swiss NCP to support an elaboration
of an action plan between TUK Indonesia and RSPO regarding the resolution of this
ongoing RSPO complaint. The Swiss NCP accepted the submission for further examination
on 31 May 2018, and is currently facilitating dialogue between the parties.

1.3.4. Submitters of specific instances
As in previous years, NGOs have continued to be the primary users of the NCP system. In
2018, their share of submissions was 41% (21 submissions) which is slightly less than in
previous years where they have accounted for approximately 50% of all submissions. Trade
unions made 12 submissions (23%) and individuals made 12 submissions (23%). (See
Figure 1.8). This year submissions were also filed by companies regarding the conduct of
other companies, and in one situation, a specific instance was initiated by the NCP itself
(Denmark, see Box 1.7).22
Box 1.7. Self-initiated NCP specific instances

Danish Ministry of Defence concerning the Lauge Koch vessel (NCP of Denmark):
This case was initiated by the NCP at its own initiative. The Danish NCP rules of procedure
are unique in that they provide that any member of the NCP may instigate a case be
reviewed by their own initiative. This case concerned the use of forced labour from North
Korea in the building of an inspection vessel – commissioned by the Danish ministry of
defence during 2014 and 2015 – at a shipyard in Poland. The NCP concluded in its final
statement that the ministry did not carry out due diligence as expected and made a number
of recommendations to ensure that the ministry’s policies and due diligence processes align
with the recommendations of the Guidelines.

1.4. NCP structures and activities
1.4.1. Structures and locations
As established by the Decision on the Guidelines, while Adherent governments have
flexibility in how to structure their NCP, they are under an obligation to make available
human and financial resources to their National Contact Points so that they can effectively
fulfil their responsibilities.23 Key among these responsibilities is:


Seeking the active support of social partners;



Dealing with the broad range of issues covered by the Guidelines;



Operating in an impartial manner; and



Developing and maintaining relations with stakeholders.24

Governments are also expected to ensure that their NCP can operate in accordance with the
core criteria of visibility, accessibility, transparency and accountability.25 When handling
specific instances, NCPs should also observe the principles of impartiality, predictability,
equitability and compatibility with the Guidelines.26
In 2018, NCPs were operating with the following four decision-making structures:


Individualised decision-making: Individualised decision-making means decisions
are either by one individual in a single ministry, or by a group of individuals
belonging to the same service in the same ministry.
o In 2018, 20 NCPs were operating with individualised decision-making:
Australia, Austria, Chile, Colombia, Estonia, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Israel,
Italy, Kazakhstan, Luxembourg, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Poland, Turkey,
Ukraine, the United Kingdom and the United States.



Inter-ministerial decision-making: Inter-ministerial decision-making means
decisions are made by a group of representatives from several ministries or
government agencies.
o In 2018, the 16 NCPs with inter-ministerial decision-making included the NCPs
of Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Costa Rica, Egypt, Germany, Hungary, Japan,
Jordan, Korea, Morocco, Portugal, Romania, Slovenia, Spain and Switzerland.
The number of entities represented on inter-ministerial decision-making bodies
ranges from two (Portugal) to 12 (Brazil).



Multipartite decision-making: Multipartite decision-making means decisions are
taken by a group composed of members of governments and stakeholders.
o In 2018, there were eight NCPs with multipartite decision-making. Five were
tripartite, i.e. they include representatives of government, business and trade
unions (Belgium, France, Latvia, Sweden and Tunisia). Three were operating
with a quadripartite decision-making structure by including representatives of
civil society organisations (Czech Republic, Finland and the Slovak Republic).



Expert-based decision-making: Under this model, the NCP’s decisions are made
by experts who are external to governments. NCPs with expert-based decisionmaking are generally set up as entities independent of the government, although
they are dependent upon the government for funding and for appointment of the
experts. Experts may be required to act in a personal capacity and not to represent
particular interests or on the contrary may represent the views of the organisations
that nominated them.
o In 2018, the NCPs of Norway, Denmark, Lithuania and the Netherlands were
operating with expert-based decision-making.

Each Adherent Government can also decide on the location of its NCP, bearing in mind the
core criteria for functional equivalence. In 2018:


31 NCPs were located in Ministries of Economy (including Ministries of Trade,
Investment, Business etc.);





7 NCPs were located in Ministries of Foreign Affairs;
5 NCPs were located in Investment Promotion Agencies;
4 NCPs were independent.

In 2018, Tunisia announced the re-establishment of its NCP and that it will take a tripartite
structure. In addition, three NCPs (Australia, New Zealand and Spain) reported changes to
their structures or locations.
In 2018, the OECD published a report entitled “Structures and Procedures of National
Contact Points for the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises.”27 The report maps
how Governments have set up their NCPs and how the mechanisms operate and make
decisions in relation to their mandates.

Box 1.8. Findings of the report on NCP structures and NCP activity

The analysis shows that NCP structures vary widely across NCP network. In terms of
challenges and opportunities linked to such structures, the analysis suggests that the
presence of a structural connection – at decision-making or advisory level – between the
NCP, other government departments and stakeholders, increases the expertise available to
the NCP, opens avenues to seek the support of social partners, and fosters policy coherence.
Such inclusiveness may however come at an organisational cost, since it increases the
number of participants in NCP activities, the frequency and size of meetings, or the amount
of time needed to reach consensus. In order to limit these costs, NCPs have implemented
creative solutions to make the NCP more agile in discharging its various tasks. Finally,
securing sufficient human and financial resources to effectively fulfil their responsibilities
remains a challenge for NCPs. Scarce resources, particularly staff resources, limit the
amount of promotion that an NCP can conduct, and can make it more difficult for NCPs to
handle specific instances in an efficient and timely manner.

1. NATIONAL CONTACT POINTS FOR RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS CONDUCT

In addition, responding to a request by the OECD Council, the Secretariat finalised a
comparative analysis of NCP activity across different NCP structures, with a view to
identifying which NCP structures had the most positive impact on NCP activity (see Box
1.8). A preliminary analysis was presented at the meetings of the NCP Network in June
and December 2018. This analysis may assist Governments that are in the process of
establishing their NCP or considering structural reform to current arrangements.
Over the course of 2018, two NCPs made changes to their structure/mandate of note.
Firstly, the Norwegian NCP now has the mandate to consider complaints under the
International Labour Organization’s Tripartite Declaration of principles concerning
multinational enterprises and social policy (see Box 1.9). Secondly, the Australian NCP
made several amendments to its structure which will take effect in 2019 following findings
from an independent review in 2017 (see Box 1.10).
Box 1.9. Extended mandate of the National Contact Point of Norway

As of 2018, the Norwegian National Contact Point will also have the mandate to receive
and assess complaints under the International Labour Organization’s Tripartite Declaration
of principles concerning multinational enterprises and social policy (Declaration). The
Declaration provides guidance to companies, governments, and employers’ and workers’
organizations in the areas of employment, training, conditions of work and life and
industrial relations. It builds on international labour standards and the obligations that
States have through their ILO membership and ratification of ILO agreements. First
adopted in 1976, the Declaration was most recently revised in 2017 to reflect international
developments, including the adoption of the UN Guiding Principles on Business and
Human Rights. Consequently, the revised Declaration establishes an independent
responsibility on companies to respect human rights across their operations and business
relationships and to do so through a process of due diligence, in alignment with the UN
Guiding Principles and the OECD Guidelines.
The extended mandate complements the current operations of the Norwegian NCP, namely
to provide Norwegian multinational enterprises and Government agencies with advice and
guidance relating to responsible business conduct and to treat specific instances relating to
Norwegian companies alleged non-compliance with the OECD Guidelines, including
across global supply chains.

Box 1.10. Independent review of the Australian National Contact Point

In 2017, the Australian Treasury commissioned an independent review of the Australian
National Contact Point with a view to evaluate the administrative structure of the NCP and
its fit within the Australian Government. The final review – released in 2018 – issued a
series of recommendations that highlighted the need for increased independence and
expertise in decision-making, clearer procedural guidance, improved stakeholder outreach
and dedicated resources.
In response to these recommendations, in 2018, Treasury committed to several changes to
the role and functioning of the NCP, including:

38  1. NATIONAL CONTACT POINTS FOR RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS CONDUCT


The appointment of an independent expert that, as of 2019, will undertake all
specific instance handling work. The independent expert will benefit from
administrative support from the NCP’s secretariat, but will have autonomy to make
independent decisions.



The establishment of a new advisory body, comprising both government
representatives and external members from companies and civil society
organisations.



Revisions to the procedural guidance, with new guidance released in July 2018.



Strengthened commitments to ensure human and financial resources to sustain the
work of the NCP and the improvement of outreach and promotional activities to
increase awareness of the Guidelines and the NCP.

1.4.2. Rules of procedure for the handling of specific instances
Having clear rules of procedure is an important way to ensure a predictable process to
resolve cases and to build trust among stakeholders. The NCP community has made
important progress in this regard. As of 2018, 40 NCPs have rules of procedures available
online, compared with 35 in 2017. Five NCPs made rules of procedure available online
over the course of 2018 (Israel, Kazakhstan, Latvia, Sweden and Ukraine). and 11 NCPs
modified their rules of procedure (Argentina, Australia, Chile, Costa Rica, Denmark,
Estonia, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Korea, and Slovak Republic), indicating that many NCPs are
also building their internal capacity to handle cases and refining their rules of procedure to
ensure a more consistent approach to case-handling across the NCP network..

1.4.3. Reporting
As part of the core criteria for functional equivalence, NCPs are required to be accountable.
In practice, this means that the NCP communicates publicly on what activities is has
participated in or organised, and how it has assessed and concluded specific instances.
Under the Procedural Guidance, NCPs must report annually to the OECD Investment
Committee28 and may communicate on a regular basis to Government and/or Parliament.
Such reporting can be an important means to raise the internal profile of NCPs within their
Governments and to ensure that budgetary challenges that the NCPs may face can be
addressed.
In 2018, one NCP did not report to the OECD (Jordan), in comparison with two NCPs that
did not report to the OECD in 2017 (Jordan and Tunisia).
In 2018, 33 NCPs reported on their activities to their Government, and 11 reported to
Parliament.29

1.4.4. Meeting attendance
NCPs are required to meet regularly to share experience, in particular by attending the two
annual meetings of the NCP Network at the OECD and to report annually to the OECD
Investment Committee.30
In 2018, a total of 43 NCPs attended the meeting of the network in June and the same
number attended in December. Three NCPs did not attend the meeting in either June or
December compared to two NCPs in 2017.

1.4.5. Stakeholders as part of the institutional arrangements
Stakeholders can be formally integrated into the institutional arrangements of the NCP, for
example as members of the NCP or the NCPs’ advisory or oversight bodies. Including key
stakeholders – such as workers’ organisations, civil society organisations and the business
community – as part of the NCP’s institutional arrangement can serve to enhance the
expertise available to the NCP and may render it easier to maintain relations with
stakeholders, to seek their support, and ultimately to gain and retain their confidence.

1.4.6. Oversight and advisory bodies
To promote impartiality of the NCPs, the OECD Guidelines recommend that NCPs
establish multi-stakeholder advisory and/or oversight bodies. While these do not normally
form part of the NCP and do not have decision-making power on accepting or concluding
specific instances, they can provide important advice to the NCP on a range of issues. NCP
oversight and advisory bodies may be composed of different types of stakeholders (e.g.
business alone; business and trade unions; business, workers’ organisations and civil
society representatives). In 2018:



17 NCPs reported having an advisory body
6 NCPs reported having a combined advisory/oversight body.31

In practice, the structures and mandates of current advisory and oversight bodies across the
NCP Network vary significantly. For instance, NCP advisory bodies are composed of
different types of stakeholders: some are composed only of government representatives,
others are composed of ‘external’ stakeholders (business alone; business and workers’
organisations; business, workers’ organisations and civil society organisations), and yet
others are composed of both government and stakeholders. Certain NCPs also include other
actors such as National Human Rights Institutions or ‘unaffiliated’ independent experts
(such as academics) on their advisory boards. Likewise, the role of these bodies and the
topics on which they are consulted (from general matters to actual specific instance cases)
also varies.

1.4.7. NCP resources
As established by the Decision on the Guidelines, adhering Governments have a legal
obligation to establish NCPs and to ensure that they have the human and financial resources
they need to effectively promote the Guidelines and handle the broad range of specific
instances that they may receive. In June 2017, the OECD Ministerial Council Statement,

ANNUAL REPORT ON THE OECD GUIDELINES FOR MULTINATIONAL ENTERPRISES 2018 © OECD 2019

 41

-----------------------Page 43 End-----------------------

42  1. NATIONAL CONTACT POINTS FOR RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS CONDUCT
entitled “Making globalisation work: better lives for all” committed to “having fully
functioning and adequately resourced National Contact Points”.32
Nevertheless, insufficient human and financial resources continues to be noted as a major
concern by both NCPs and stakeholders. Lack of resources has translated into a lack of
skills development for several NCPs; this is a challenge since the growing complexity of
specific instances demand that NCPs address increasingly complex and sophisticated
issues. At present, many NCPs do not have staff that are solely devoted to the
responsibilities of the mechanism: in most NCPs, members of staff are also responsible for
other Government portfolios and therefore have little time to spend on NCP-related tasks.
While this can have benefits – such as staff being involved in other RBC related areas of
work and being exposed to expertise that is important for the NCP’s functioning – it can
also have the effect of less active NCPs, as staff working on multiple issues may have little
time to devote to actual NCP activities.
In 2018:


14 NCPs reported having both dedicated full-time and part-time staff



12 NCPs reported having full-time staff only



19 NCPs had part-time staff only



4 NCPs had no dedicated staff33

Furthermore, frequent turnover of staff continues to present a challenge to NCPs in terms
of ensuring institutional memory and handling ongoing specific instances. In 2018:


24 NCPs reported that full-time or part-time staff had joined the NCP



23 NCPs reported that full-time or part-time staff had left the NCP

With regards financial resources:


24 NCPs had access to a dedicated budget for their activities.



Of the 24 NCPs that did not have a dedicated budget, 21 reported that they could
access, on an ad-hoc basis, financial resources for promotional activities and 16
reported that they could do so for specific instances.34



All 46 reporting NCPs noted that funds would be available to them for attending
NCP meetings at the OECD.

At the December 2018 meeting of the Network of NCPs, a dedicated session allowed NCPs
to exchange on their various budgetary structures, current challenges with respect to human
and financial resources and strategies for overcoming resource constraints. NCPs from
Italy, Denmark, Canada, Chile, France, Switzerland, Colombia, Germany and Norway
presented potential challenges associated with resource constraints and strategies that could
be mobilised to address these.

1.5. Promotion of the Guidelines
Ensuring that NCPs are visible requires sustained efforts to raise awareness among the business
community, worker organisations, civil society organisations and other interested parties. An
important function of NCPs is to promote awareness of the OECD Guidelines and the due
diligence guidance that offers tools to the private sector on how to do business responsibly.
NCPs will play a critical role in supporting the wide dissemination of the 2018 OECD Due
Diligence Guidance for Responsible Business Conduct which provides practical guidance
on the key elements of supply chain due diligence. In particular, the Council
Recommendation specifically recommends that NCPs “ensure the widest possible
dissemination of the Guidance and its active use by enterprises, as well as promote the use
of the Guidance as a resource for stakeholders”.35 To facilitate the broad uptake of the
guidance several NCPs are also in the process of translating it into other languages (e.g. the
Spanish version is being developed jointly by the NCPs of Spain and Latin American
Adherents. Several NCPs also organised events in 2018 to help promote awareness and
understanding of the due diligence process. See Box 1.11 for examples.
Box 1.11. Examples of events organised by NCPs to promote due diligence

The NCP of Switzerland in cooperation with the Global Compact Network Switzerland
organised an event to present the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Business
Conduct, identify implementation steps and discuss challenges. The event attracted practitioners
who learned about technical aspects of the due diligence process through facilitated scenarios.
Switzerland presented its guidance on human rights due diligence for commodity trading
companies, which references the OECD Due Diligence Guidance, in a side-event on due
diligence and commodity trading of the UN Forum on Business and Human Rights.
The NCP of Norway developed a three day training course on responsible business conduct and
due diligence for Norwegian enterprises.36 Related to the course, Norway launched a unique
self-assessment tool, the RBC Compass, which gives an overview of the extent to which an
enterprise complies with the OECD Guidelines.37 Norway also launched an introduction in
Norwegian to the OECD Due Diligence Guidance on RBC. The introduction was developed
with input from stakeholders from business, trade unions, civil society and academia.
The NCP of the United Kingdom (UK NCP) partnered with UK Finance, an industry association
representing 300 firms in the UK providing credit, banking, markets and payment-related
services, to organise an awareness raising event on the OECD work on responsible business
conduct and due diligence in the financial sector. The UK NCP also facilitated coordination with
UK Finance to host an expert working session with practitioners to feed into the OECD’s
ongoing work on defining due diligence approaches for general corporate lending and
underwriting securities transactions.

In 2018, NCPs continued to take important steps in promoting both the Guidelines and due
diligence guidance. In 2018 a total of 184 events were organised or co-organised by 34
NCPs. This represents a steady increase from 2015 where the number of events organised
by NCPs was 112 (see Figure 1.9.).
Fourteen NCPs did not organise or co-organise any promotional events.38

as due diligence and responsible supply chains across different economic sectors. In 2018,
26 NCPs (55% of NCPs)39 hosted an annual meeting with stakeholders.
In addition to organising or co-organising events, 37 NCPs reported taking part in a total
of 269 events organised by others, during which they participated in presentations, panels
and discussions. A total of eleven NCPs did not participate in any promotional events.
Since 2015, the number of NCPs that organised promotional events grew from 24 to 34 in
2018 (see Figure 1.10.). The number of NCPs participating in events has also increased.
In 2018, 37 NCPs participated in events, up from 29 in 2015 (see Figure 1.10.).

NCPs also continued to use a variety of tools to promote the Guidelines and the specific
instance mechanism. For example, 4 NCPs (Switzerland, Ukraine, Denmark, and the
Netherlands) have conducted surveys among the business community and other
stakeholders to measure awareness of the Guidelines and the NCP. These kind of surveys
have offered unique insight into the impact of NCPs’ promotional work, and allowed NCPs
to develop targeted activities to maximise the impact of their promotional activities.
At the NCP meeting in June 2018, several NCPs presented recent initiatives to measure
awareness of the Guidelines and the NCPs’ functioning. The NCPs of Switzerland and
Ukraine presented recent initiatives taken to measure stakeholder awareness of the OECD
Guidelines, in particular by the use of surveys and indicators to monitor progress. NCPs
highlighted the importance of measuring awareness not only about the existence of the
OECD Guidelines, but also about that specific elements of the Guidelines, in particular
risk-based due diligence and the thematic chapters. Noting the proliferation of international
standards and good practice addressing responsible business conduct and corporate social
responsibility, NCPs also highlighted the need for promotional activities and targets to
focus on articulating the benefits of the OECD Guidelines and what their relationship is
with other international RBC/CSR initiatives.
In 2018, multi-stakeholder groups were the largest target audience for NCP events,
consisting of 42% of total event audiences. This group was followed by business (20%),
government (17%), and academia (7%) (see Figure 1.11.). Additionally, the large majority
of NCP events had an audience size of less than 10 or between 10-50 participants (see
Figure 1.12.).

approach to promotional activities, developing detailed plans with key targets and
objectives.

1. NATIONAL CONTACT POINTS FOR RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS CONDUCT

1.5.1. Accessibility of information – NCP websites
Although there is no specific requirement for NCPs to have a website, an important aspect
of being visible is online presence through a dedicated website where rules of procedures
and regular updates about NCP activities and specific instance outcomes are made public.
For many stakeholders, NCP websites have served as a principal point of contact for
submitting specific instances.


A total of 46 NCPs have dedicated websites or dedicated webpages on the
Ministry’s website that provide information about the Guidelines and the NCP,
including contact information for reaching the mechanism.



15 NCPs reported creating new or improved websites in 2018.

1.5.2. NCP hosted peer-learning events
The Commentary on the Implementation Procedures of the OECD Guidelines for
Multinational Enterprises provides that “NCPs will engage in joint peer learning
activities.”40 On 5-6 September 2018, at the initiative of the NCPs of Norway and Denmark,
the Lithuanian NCP hosted a workshop in Vilnius for NCPs from the Nordic-Baltic
countries: Sweden, Finland, Iceland, Denmark, Norway, Latvia and Lithuania. The focus
of the peer-learning event was how NCPs can best meet the core criteria of visibility,
accessibility, transparency and accountability. The peer-learning event addressed
institutional arrangements with dedicated staff and budget, rules of procedures, website and
activities to promote the OECD Guidelines and the NCP. A similar Nordic-Baltic peerlearning event is set to take place in Oslo, Norway, in May 2019.
On 10 October 2018, the Dutch NCP organised an international conference – also serving
as a peer-learning event – in The Hague, Netherlands. This conference – which brought
together companies, government representatives, civil society organisations, academics
and 10 NCPs – emphasized the positive impacts that NCPs can generate through a variety
of presentations that highlighted best practices and lessons learned.
In 2018, the Ukrainian NCP also conducted a study visit to the Dutch NCP to learn about
the way the NCP of the Netherlands has been structured and how it functions.

1.5.3. UN Annual Forum on Business and Human Rights
The seventh annual UN Annual Forum on Business and Human Rights took place on 2628 November 2018 in Geneva, Switzerland. Under the theme “Business respect for human
rights – building on what works”, the Forum focused on the corporate responsibility to
respect human rights, and in particular the requirement that companies exercise human
rights due diligence to prevent adverse impacts on people. It highlighted emerging practices
in different sectors and across value chains, and what human rights due diligence implies
in relation to specific human rights risks and impacts. Several NCPs attended the event and
participated in panels.

1.6. Global Forum on Responsible Business Conduct
Several NCPs participated in the Global Forum on Responsible Business Conduct in June
2018. Dedicated sessions involving NCPs included:



NCPs: a mechanism to promote social dialogue. This session highlighted that
involvement in a specific instance can become the start of a longer-term
relationship of social dialogue between parties to the process and highlighted the
key lessons learnt from three successful NCP cases (FIFA, Unilever and Natixis)
that have served as a springboard for continued social dialogue.41



The role of National Contact Points and National Human Rights Institutions in
RBC Policy Making. The session offered a forum for discussion on how NCPs and
NHRIs can engage in relation to RBC policy making – and have already done so despite their different structures and mandates. Representatives from Chile,
Morocco and New Zealand (NCPs, NHRIs and Governments) presented various
types of engagement models between NCPs and NHRIs, ranging from formal
arrangements through the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding for
cooperation (Chile) or the inclusion of the NHRI in the decision-making body of
the NCP (Morocco) to more informal engagement on specific issues (New
Zealand).



Accountability and Remedy. Organised by the Office of the UN High
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), this session presented findings from
OHCHR’s Accountability and Remedy project on the role of State-based nonjudicial grievance mechanisms, including NCPs, in providing access to effective
remedy. With the participation of the NCPs of Denmark and France, the session
focused on specific steps that States can take to ensure effective non-judicial
grievance mechanisms, drawing on the effectiveness criteria established by the UN
Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.

1.7. Action Plan to strengthen NCPs
The first Action Plan to strengthen NCPs (2016-2018) continued to be implemented over
the course of 2018 under its three overarching priority areas: peer reviews and capacitybuilding, peer learning, and the development of tools to support NCPs, mainly on the forms
of reports developed jointly with NCPs. NCP publications issued in 2018 are listed in
Box 1.7.
NCP Peer reviews offer an important opportunity to appreciate and share the internal
workings of an NCP and any barriers the NCP may face in realising its objectives, as well
as achievements and good practices in discharging its functions. The peer reviews also
include an examination of the NCP’s procedures and approach to handling of specific
instances which can help improve consistency going forward.
In 2018, the peer reviews of five NCPs (Austria, Canada, Chile, Germany and the United
States) were concluded. Of the 48 NCPs, 13 have been peer reviewed with one review
ongoing. In addition, two NCPs underwent significant reviews as part of the process of
accession to the OECD. An additional seven governments have a peer review of their NCP
scheduled (Table 1.6). This leaves a total of 25 governments having not yet committed to
a peer review of which 15 are OECD members (Table 1.7).

Peer reviews are funded by the government of the NCP under review. The amount of the
contribution is as established in the document: Funding the NCP Action Plan (2016-18) and
in the new Action Plan to Strengthen National Contact Points for Responsible Business
Conduct (2019-2021). For some governments, providing funding has been an obstacle to
committing to a peer review or to delivering on their commitment.

Recommendations from the completed peer reviews are included in Annex II. The peer
reviews of the NCPs of Spain, Korea and Argentina are scheduled for 2019, the peer
reviews of the Australian and Swedish NCPs for 2020, the peer review of the Greek NCP
for 2021 and the peer review of the Slovenian NCP for 2022.
Since 2015, peer reviews were done using a core template for assessing NCP performance,
addressing the core criteria – visibility, accessibility, transparency, accountability, and
principles for handling cases – impartiality, predictability, equitability, and compatibility
with the Guidelines. On the basis of feedback from peer review participants (including
NCPs, representatives from governments as well as business, trade unions and NGOs), a
paper with proposed areas for improvement to the current peer review methodology was
discussed by the WPRBC at its December 2018 meeting. Proposals for amendments to the
core template were discussed by the Working Party at its meeting in March 2019. A new
version of the revised core template taking comments into account will be shared for
approval by the Secretariat.
The current Action Plan to strengthen NCPs covered the period January 2016 – December
2018. A second Action Plan for the years 2019-2021 was discussed by the WPRBC in
December 2018 and approved in February 2019. Building upon the lessons learnt from the
implementation of the first Action Plan, the second Action Plan suggests new areas of focus
to support the NCPs to better meet their mandate and cooperate more effectively. It sets the

target of ensuring six NCP peer reviews per year to meet the goal of having all NCP peer
reviewed by 2023.
Subject to availability of funding, the Action Plan will deliver additional peer support to
NCPs facing challenges meeting the core criteria, sharing of expertise and skills among the
NCPs, capacity-building among peers through regional and thematic NCP networks,
Secretariat support to NCPs to assess and address capacity-building needs among key
stakeholders, developing websites and other support tools, and supporting the mechanisms
to identify and engage with national-level opportunities to provide their expertise to RBC
developments.
Since 2016, the Secretary-General of the OECD has communicated with Ministers in
adhering countries whose NCPs do not yet exist, have not reported to the OECD Investment
Committee, do not have a website, have not conducted or participated in promotional
events, or do not have rules of procedures. In December 2018, 10 adhering Governments
(Egypt, Estonia, Greece, Iceland, Jordan, Portugal, Romania, Slovenia, Tunisia and
Ukraine) received such letters and were invited to report back on progress made.

1.8. Substantiated submission by OECD Watch
In November 2017, OECD Watch made the first substantiated submission under the
Procedural Guidance of the Guidelines. Under the Procedural Guidance, the Investment
Committee “will consider a substantiated submission […] on whether an NCP is fulfilling
its responsibilities with regard to its handling of specific instances.”42 The submission was
made by OECD Watch in respect of the Australian NCP’s handling of a specific instance
that raised concerns over the role of a private security company in Papua New Guinea.
The substantiated submission was considered by the Investment Committee in 2018. In its
response, the Investment Committee issued several recommendations with a view to
promote increased transparency and to build trust with all parties to a specific instance
process (see Annex III).
During its meeting of October 2018, the Investment Committee called on the Working
Party for Responsible Business Conduct to further elaborate the procedure for responding
to substantiated submissions to address current gaps as well as comments raised by OECD
Watch and the Australian NCP. The original procedure was included in "Addressing issues
relating to the functioning and performance of NCPs” DAF/INV/RBC(2015)1. A paper
presenting suggestions for how the procedure can be further strengthened to promote
transparency, predictability, equitability and efficiency, based on lessons learned from
development of a response to the first submission was presented to the Working Party at
its December 2018 meeting and a new procedure will be shared for approval in 2019.
The paper sought to improve the clarity and transparency of the process and suggested, amongst
other things, that consultations on the substantiated submission be equal in number between the
NCPs under review and the submitter(s), that quarterly updates to all parties on how the process
is unfolding should be provided. It also put forward the suggestions that where a member or
national of the country of the NCP whose conduct is in question in the substantiated submission
is also a member of the Working Party Bureau in their personal capacity, they may be asked to
excuse themselves from consultations at the level of the Bureau.

1. NATIONAL CONTACT POINTS FOR RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS CONDUCT

Box 1.11. NCP publications

In 2018 several reports were developed regarding NCP activities and functioning:
OECD (2018) Facilitating social dialogue under the OECD Guidelines for Multinational
Enterprises: This study explores the role of the National Contact Points (NCPs) in dealing
with cases relating to the implementation of the OECD Guidelines with a particular focus
on labour issues and social dialogue. Historically, a significant number of cases brought
before NCPs have involved the OECD Guidelines’ chapter on employment and industrial
relations. It includes four case studies each of which describes specific instance and offers
some insight into how dialogue was promoted and why a particular outcome was achieved.
These observations are informed by multiple sources including, most importantly, a
number of stakeholder interviews conducted with trade union, business and NCP
representatives.
OECD (2018), Structures and Procedures of National Contact Points for the OECD
Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises: This report describes how governments have
set up their NCP and how NCPs operate and make decisions related to the implementation
of their mandate. The findings of this work aim to facilitate co-operation among NCPs, and
to help stakeholders and the wider public better understand how NCPs work and take
decisions. The content is based on interviews with representatives from 15 NCPs, the
institutional stakeholders to the OECD Guidelines (the Business and Industry Advisory
Committee, the Trade Union Advisory Committee and OECD Watch) and other
stakeholders.
OECD (2018), Issues paper: Coordination between OECD National Contact Points
during Specific Instance Handling: The paper considers current challenges in specific
instance coordination amongst NCPs and identify good practice to help ensure consistency
and encourage resolution of issues. It provides guidance on the following questions: What
does the Procedural Guidance say about coordination on specific instances between NCPs?
How do NCPs coordinate on specific instances in practice? What are the perspectives of
institutional stakeholders with respect to coordination on specific instances? What are
some of the good practices for coordination on specific instances?
OECD (2018) Issues paper: Confidentiality and Campaigning during Specific Instances
Handling by OECD National Contact Points: The paper considers current challenges with
respect to confidentiality and campaigning issues in the context of handling specific
instances. This paper provides guidance on the following questions: What does the
Procedural Guidance say about transparency, confidentiality, campaigning and good faith
participation? How do NCP's address issues of confidentiality and campaigning through
their own rules of procedure and policies? How have other grievance or mediation
platforms approached confidentiality and campaigning issues? What are the various
stakeholder perspectives on confidentiality and campaigning? What good practices should
NCPs take into account in developing effective approaches for balancing transparency and
confidentiality concerns?

Chapter 2.
Due diligence to implement the Guidelines

2.1. Convergence and alignment on OECD Due Diligence Guidance
Companies are increasingly basing their decisions about where to do business on the ability
to ensure predictable and reliable supply chains and sustainability criteria are playing an
increasing role in the choice of suppliers or business relationships. The Guidelines embed
the expectation that enterprises carry out due diligence to identify, prevent and mitigate
real and potential adverse impacts across their operations and business relationships and to
account for how those impacts are addressed. Due diligence for responsible business
conduct helps businesses contribute to economic and social growth without causing or
contributing to adverse impacts. It also contributes towards holding businesses accountable
for adverse impacts where they do occur.
Encouraging companies across sectors to carry out due diligence for responsible business
conduct is increasingly on the global agenda. There has been political demand amongst
Members and within the G7 and G20 for greater clarity on how companies can operate
responsibly in global supply chains. The 2016 G7 Leader’s Declaration noted that G7
countries will continue to strive for better application of internationally recognised labour,
social and environmental standards in global supply chains. The 2017 G20 Leaders’
Declaration noted they would work towards establishing adequate policy frameworks such
as national action plans on business and human rights and underline the responsibility of
businesses to exercise due diligence.
To respond to these calls, foster convergence and set a
common standard for due diligence the OECD developed the
Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Business Conduct.
An OECD Council Recommendation on the Guidance was
adopted by Minsters on 30 May 2018 with the aim of
providing support to all types of companies operating in all
countries and sectors of the economy by setting out practical,
clear explanations of how to implement due diligence as
recommended in the OECD Guidelines for Multinational
Enterprises. 1 The Guidance and Recommendation were a key
deliverable of the 2018 OECD Ministerial Council Meeting
and were adopted by all 48 Adherents to the Guidelines. They
respond to a call by ministers to develop a set of general due
diligence guidelines that can be applied to any sector. Governments, through the
Investment Committee and its Working Party on Responsible Business Conduct, will

monitor the implementation of the Recommendation and report to the OECD
Council thereon no later than 2024.
This Guidance is the first government backed reference on due diligence which is relevant
for all types of companies and helps companies respond to the expectations set out in the
MNE Guidelines that they carry out due diligence to identify, prevent and mitigate real and
potential adverse impacts across their operations and business relationships and to account
for how those impacts are addressed.
The Guidance represents a common understanding among governments and stakeholders
on due diligence for responsible business conduct and can also be used by businesses to
respond to due diligence expectations of the UN Guiding Principles on Business and
Human Rights and the ILO Tripartite Declaration of Principles Concerning Multinational
Enterprises and Social Policy. It was developed through a multi-stakeholder process
including representatives from OECD and non-OECD Member countries, international
organisations, business, trade unions and civil society. The UN Working Group on
Business & Human Rights underscored the status of the Guidance as an important authority
on due diligence and on alignment with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human
Rights. In a report it notes that “[t]he recently issued OECD Due Diligence Guidance for
Responsible Business Conduct […] provides a comprehensive practical tool for supporting
implementation of human rights due diligence in line with the Guiding Principles, which is
based on comprehensive multi-stakeholder inputs and dialogue.”2 The diagram below
shows the due diligence framework foreseen in the Guidance.

54  2. DUE DILIBENCE TO IMPLEMENT THE GUIDELINES
The OECD worked closely with the OHCHR and members of the UN Working Group on
Business & Human Rights in developing the Guidance. Bringing clarity and alignment to
stakeholders and reinforcing the linkages between international instruments ultimately
facilitates uptake of OECD standards on due diligence by business and facilitates outreach
activities to countries that do not adhere to the relevant OECD instruments. The Guidance
was formally launched during the 2018 OECD Global Forum on Responsible Business
Conduct and was also heavily showcased at the 2018 UN Forum on Business and Human
Rights, which featured due diligence as its theme. An implementation plan for the Guidance
to support its dissemination and uptake was approved by the WPRBC in March 2019. In
the second half of 2018, the OECD Secretariat developed and provided training on the
Guidance to enterprises, governments and NCPs.
Convergence around OECD standards was furthermore
fostered through the Secretariat’s work on alignment. A
methodology to assess the alignment of industry-led
programmes in the minerals sector with the OECD Due
Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of
Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas3
(‘Minerals Guidance’) was released in April 2018. The
alignment assessment4 has already led to major changes in
the standards of the participating programmes. The
standards of the five pilot participants were 64% aligned to
the OECD Minerals Guidance prior to the assessment; this
figure went up to an average of 97% alignment of standards
after changes that were recommended as part of the project.
The OECD alignment assessment methodology was
furthermore embedded into a Delegated Act of the European Commission, which foresees
a consultative role for the OECD Secretariat in the EU’s recognition of industry schemes
deemed compliant with the EU Regulation 2017/821. 5The regulation – which comes into
force in 2021 - lays down supply chain due diligence obligations for Union importers of
tin, tantalum and tungsten, their ores, and gold originating from conflict-affected and highrisk areas in line with the OECD Minerals Guidance.
The same approach was launched in 2018 in the garment sector. 6 To help reinforce a
common framework for due diligence while also enabling cross-recognition between
programmes, the OECD has developed an Alignment Assessment methodology to evaluate
programmes against the OECD Garment Guidance. The draft assessment tool and
methodology were launched in January 2018 and a pilot with the Sustainable Apparel
Coalition carried out.

2. DUE DILIBENCE TO IMPLEMENT THE GUIDELINES

2.2. Digital solutions to support supply chain due diligence
To identify the areas of the value chain where risks are most likely to be present and most
significant, businesses need reliable and easily accessible information, particularly from
midstream and upstream supply chain actors on these risks. Distributed ledger technology
such as blockchain may offer an ability to more easily manage increasingly complicated
networks of suppliers with a greater level of trust, ideally establishing proof of quality,
provenance, and payment on the raw materials and products being tracked. Recently, a
multitude of supply chain due diligence blockchain initiatives have developed across
different sectors to help address issues of traceability, sharing of risk information and data
integrity. However, concerns have been raised about the lack of controls on the quality of
information initially entered into the system, lack of access by vulnerable groups to this
technology, scalability and incentives for uptake, the emergence of multiple competing
databases for similar supply chains and lack of interoperability for various systems.
However, by design, blockchains are inherently resistant to modification of the data, rather
than relying on easy-to-forge paper documents. Blockchain may offer an ability to more
easily manage increasingly complicated networks of suppliers with a greater level of trust,
ideally establishing proof of quality, provenance, and payment on the raw materials and
products being tracked.
As part of a broader effort to promote and coordinate best practice in the area of supply
chain due diligence, the OECD has launched research on how blockchain technology is
being developed to facilitate responsible business conduct and how due diligence standards
can be integrated into emerging blockchain initiatives in a consistent and effective way.
This research will explore the application of blockchain technology for due diligence across
different sectors, and analyse the strengths and weaknesses of each potential use. This
includes, in particular, the use of blockchain for establishing traceability of goods and
services in supply chains, for mapping of supply chain actors and locations, for sharing of
information on risk (e.g. relating to human rights, conflict finance, or financial crime) and
certification, the use of smart contracts to allow for greater inclusiveness, and use of tokens
and incentives to drive implementation and create value due diligence information and
efforts. The research will also discuss good practice for business and governments to follow
in setting up or supporting blockchain systems and pitfalls for businesses and policy makers
to avoid as initiatives begin developing.
The OECD furthermore convened a number of enterprises, policy makers and industry
initiatives to explore together the role blockchain technology could play in assisting
enterprises to carry out due diligence on labour and human rights, environment and
corruption risks in global garment supply chains at two meetings in 2018, one alongside
the Garment forum and the other during the OECD Blockchain Forum. The key outcome
of these discussions was the recognition of the need for a data ontology and guidance for
companies and initiatives that are planning blockchain pilots to address the issues discussed
above. The Secretariat is also coordinating with other agencies (for example, UNECEUN/CEFACT) to promote alignment of forthcoming traceability or blockchain initiatives
with the OECD Garment Guidance.

2.3. Responsible mineral supply chains
2.3.1. Results and impact measurement
One of the central hypotheses of the OECD Guidance is that
companies involved in responsible mining and trade in
minerals have the potential to generate income, growth and
prosperity, sustain livelihoods and foster local development.
This is the case even in conflict-affected and high-risk areas.
However, companies operating in or sourcing from such
areas are also at risk of contributing to or being associated
with significant adverse impacts. By implementing supply
chain due diligence, as recommended by the OECD Minerals
Guidance, companies can avoid contributing to serious
human rights abuses, support to non-state armed groups,
public or private security forces, bribery and fraudulent
misrepresentation of the origin of minerals, money
laundering and improper payment of taxes, fees and royalties due to governments.
The past eight years of implementation of the OECD Minerals Guidance have resulted in
increased awareness amongst stakeholders that companies have a responsibility to cut the
link between the mineral trade, serious human rights abuses and conflict. However, despite
anecdotal reports of various results, there appears to be a continued lack of comprehensive
and empirically-based evidence. To address this, the OECD Secretariat in 2018 launched a
project on developing a monitoring and evaluation framework to measure results of the
implementation of the OECD Minerals Guidance.
The aim of this project is to establish a monitoring and evaluation framework to measure
the outcomes of the implementation of the OECD Guidance in mineral-producing
countries. The monitoring framework will allow the OECD Secretariat to gather data on
the implementation of the OECD Minerals Guidance according to a standardised set of
indicators. It will furthermore allow the Secretariat to define the conceptual link (including
degrees of correlation or other forms of attribution) between the uptake of the OECD
Minerals Guidance and outcomes on the ground. The findings will help improve
understanding of the contribution of due diligence efforts to social and economic
development in mining communities, inform decisions about future interventions in
mineral producing countries, and identify potential implementation gaps. The framework
will be finalised and pilot tested in 2019.

2.3.2. Supporting the implementation of the Minerals Guidance beyond tin,
tantalum, tungsten and gold
While continuing to work on tin, tantalum, tungsten (3Ts) and gold, in 2018 the OECD
Secretariat increasingly worked on the uptake of the OECD Minerals Guidance in other
minerals, including cobalt, diamonds and base metals.
Among the tools being developed to assist companies to implement supply chain due
diligence, the OECD Secretariat is in the process of launching a Portal for Supply Chain
Risk Information (Risk Portal). The Risk Portal is envisioned to be a free-to-access website
that companies can use to gain an initial understanding of the risks in their supply chains
and to guide them towards further research resources. The primary purpose of the Risk
Portal is to provide information about risks that could lead those companies to ask further
questions and conduct a thorough review of what is alleged to have occurred. As such, the
ANNUAL REPORT ON THE OECD GUIDELINES FOR MULTINATIONAL ENTERPRISES 2018 © OECD 2019

-----------------------Page 58 End-----------------------

2. DUE DILIBENCE TO IMPLEMENT THE GUIDELINES

website will contain three primary sets of information: (1) data on the production and trade
of raw materials, organised by material, (2) useful links to research resources on risks,
organised by country, and (3) links recent third party reports on risks allegedly associated
with the trade and production of specific raw materials. The pilot version of the Risk Portal
will cover 40 mineral supply chains and risks mentioned in the Minerals Guidance. The
pilot is expected to be ready to launch by the end of 2019. In the long term, the Risk Portal
scope can be expanded to include raw materials and risks in other sectors.
Also looking beyond 3Ts and gold, the London Metal Exchange (LME) in October 2018
published a position paper outlining requirements for all brand-listed producers to comply
with the OECD Minerals Guidance for all metals traded on the LME (among others zinc,
aluminium, tin, copper, cobalt, steel, molybdenum and nickel). The LME supports physical
clearance, pricing and hedging services for over 75% of metal trading globally. Initial
consultations on standard setting were furthermore held with aluminium, copper and steel
industry bodies to ensure alignment with the OECD Minerals Guidance as those bodies
look to develop or adapt standards on responsible sourcing.
Throughout 2018 the Secretariat also continued its engagement with stakeholders in the
precious stones supply chain. This included providing support and technical advice to
leading industry bodies and initiatives such as the Responsible Jewellery Council, the
World Diamond Council and the World Jewellery Confederation.
At the margins of the OECD Forum on Responsible Mineral Supply Chains the Secretariat
organised a one-day meeting on cobalt, gathering key stakeholders in the global cobalt supply
chain, including downstream companies, battery manufacturers, commodity traders, exporters,
miners and officials from the Democratic Republic of Congo, which produces more than half
the global cobalt output. The meeting clarified the role of fine refiner as the point in the supply
chain where third party audits should take place and encouraged supply chain actors to review
the scope of their risk assessment in line with the OECD Minerals Guidance.

2.3.3. Outreach and engagement with key markets
Given the global nature of mineral supply chains, the OECD throughout 2018 continued to
work closely with a wide range of Adherent and non-Adherent countries to promote the
understanding and implementation of the OECD due diligence guidance.
In October 2018, the OECD Secretariat launched a capacity building programme on the
Mineral Guidance for stakeholders of the Colombian mineral supply chain. The inaugural
workshop, opened by the Colombian Vice-Minister of Mines, saw the participation of
various private sector actors from the gold and emerald supply chains, government officials
and civil society organisations. The capacity building programme follows a train-thetrainer approach, with two implementing partners - a civil society organisation and a
research centre - carrying out trainings on the ground throughout 2019 in the capital and in
the main mineral producing departments of Antioquia, Chocó, Cauca and Nariño. Capacity
building is one of the five areas covered by the recommendations formulated by the OECD
Secretariat to the Colombian government and its agencies in 2018 to continue strengthening
existing measures for a responsible, transparent and sustainable mining sector. The other
four areas for action are regulatory and strategic initiatives; reform of the single registry
RUCOM; mine site inspections, monitoring and mapping; and law enforcement
cooperation.
In 2018, outreach work on responsible mineral supply chains also continued to deepen in
Africa, building on the long-standing collaboration with governments, business and civil

society in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Rwanda, as well as expanding to
West Africa notably Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger. In West Africa, the OECD has been
working since early 2016 with the Integrated Development Authority of the LiptakoGourma Region (LGA) to promote the use of the Minerals Guidance recommendations in
its three Member States Burkina Faso, Mali, and Niger. In 2018, the OECD released a
baseline assessment of the supply chains of gold produced in those three countries in
partnership with the LGA.7 This study mapped the actors involved in production, trade and
export of gold in both the private sector (formal and informal) and the public sector,
covering industrial production as well as artisanal and small-scale mining and identified
associated risks. A 2019-2020 work plan to implement recommendations based on the
findings has been agreed with the LGA.
Since 2015, the Secretariat is furthermore engaged with Indian officials and private sector
representatives to support the development of due diligence recommendations for the
responsible sourcing of gold. India is the second largest importer of gold in the world and
a key destination for gold produced in Africa and Latin America. In 2018, the Secretariat
has been invited to speak in three major industry events in March, July and August.
However, progress have been limited, and discussions with Indian and international
stakeholders are ongoing to develop a roadmap with the local industry to finalise the
adoption of the due diligence recommendations in 2019.
The OECD Secretariat also continued its cooperation with the China Chamber of
Commerce for Metals, Minerals and Chemicals Importers and Exporters (CCCMC) and the
Responsible Cobalt Initiative on Chinese-led efforts for responsible sourcing of 3Ts, gold
and cobalt. This work consisted of technical support to develop audit protocols for Chinese
importers, smelters, and refiners in line with the Minerals Guidance as well as the
convening of global cobalt stakeholders during the annual OECD Forum on responsible
mineral supply chains in April 2018.
Box 2.1. Forum on responsible mineral supply chains

The Forum on Responsible Mineral Supply Chains is one of OECD’s largest events and in
2018 gathered over 850 participants, with 20% from governments including many nonOECD member countries, 55% from business, including large multinationals and small
mining cooperatives, and 25% from civil society. It featured more than 30 sessions
covering a wide variety of topics, from responsible cobalt, diamonds and gold, to thematic
issues on responsible mineral sourcing like the use of data driven tools and blockchain
technology to support due diligence, cost recovery along the supply chain, the gender
perspective to responsible mining, and the role of customs authorities.
Collaboration with the European Union continued following the adoption of the
aforementioned EU Regulation 2017/821 on responsible mineral supply chains, which is
based on the OECD Minerals Guidance. The OECD Secretariat continued to work closely
with the European Commission to define technical standards on due diligence and clarify
due diligence expectations for EU members, Adherents and newly appointed National
Competent Authorities for the EU Regulation.

2.4. Responsible agricultural supply chains
2.4.1. OECD-FAO pilot project on Responsible Agricultural Supply Chains
The work on responsible agricultural supply chains
includes collaboration with the Trade and Agricultural
Directorate (TAD) of the OECD as well as the Food and
Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO). In
February 2018, the OECD and FAO joined efforts to launch
a pilot project with agribusiness companies, including
investors, food manufacturers and retailers to promote the
OECD-FAO Guidance for Responsible Agricultural Supply
Chains8 (OECD-FAO Guidance). The pilot aims to
promote the practical understanding and application of the
OECD-FAO Guidance with enterprises. Through the study
of company implementation of the OECD-FAO Guidance
and other related international standards the pilot raises
awareness of challenges in due diligence implementation
but also potential solutions to address these challenges.
The pilot includes the active participation of 27 companies and seven industry initiatives
along the full agricultural value chain. The group represents mainly MNE businesses from
each part of the value chain from input providers, to investors, as well as food producers,
food and beverage manufacturers and retailers. Pilot participants come from a diversity of
food and non-food commodity chains including bananas, cocoa, cotton, livestock, palm oil,
soya, sugar and tobacco. Participating companies are based in Europe, the US, Latin
America, Asia, North Africa and the Middle East.
A pilot baseline report9 was released in September 2018. The report found that all
participating pilot companies had made commitments to addressing many responsible
business conduct issues and taken significant steps to implement such commitments. In
addition, 82% of pilot participants reported a high level of senior management support for
their policy commitments and 46% were in line with all six crosscutting standards
recommended by the OECD-FAO Guidance. However, unsurprisingly many enterprises
saw challenges in traceability and supply chain mapping beyond Tier 1 suppliers. This
challenge increases in complex supply chains where visibility into the full supply chain is
poor or where commodities are purchased from hundreds or thousands of small producers.
The report also showed gaps between companies’ commitments to RBC and the
implementation of such commitments along the supply chain. This gap between
commitments and action was an area which companies explored further through the peerlearning webinars hosted by the OECD and FAO in 2018. Peer learning session themes
included challenges on supply chain mapping, and the limits and opportunities of
technology, and strengthening collaboration with third parties (such as certification systems
as well as civil society) to improve risk management.

Pilot participants have also formed an informal working group to explore links between the
OECD-FAO Guidance and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The working
group has committed to producing a communications tool that helps enterprises make the
link between their due diligence actions and specific targets of the SDGs. This tool, along
with the final report from the pilot project, will be published in 2019 at the end of the
OECD-FAO pilot.

2.4.2. OECD-FAO roundtable on responsible agricultural supply chains
The OECD and FAO hosted a multi-stakeholder Roundtable on Responsible Agricultural
Supply Chains on the margins of the 2018 Global Forum on Responsible Business Conduct
at the OECD. The roundtable was attended by a wide diversity of stakeholders including
from civil society, policy makers, international organisations such as the ILO and industry.
Discussions at the roundtable were informed by the findings from the pilot baseline report.
The OECD and FAO continue to work collaboratively on promoting the OECD-FAO
Guidance and the Principles for Responsible Investment in Agriculture and Food Systems
of the Committee on World Food Security (CFS-RAI Principles).

In 2018 the OECD deepened its activities under its
implementation program to convene stakeholders to
engage on shared learnings - particularly around
meaningful engagement with workers in the due diligence
process, enabling traceability, and integrating a gender
lens into due diligence - promote alignment with OECD
recommendations and facilitate multi-stakeholder
collaboration in key markets.
The January 2018 OECD Forum on Due Diligence in the
Garment and Footwear Sector set the strategic direction of
the OECD’s work in the sector with feedback from the
Advisory Group. The 2018 Forum marked one year since
the launch of the Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible
Supply Chains in the Garment and Footwear Sector10
(Garment Due Diligence Guidance) and convened over
350 representatives from government, business, trade union and civil society. This two day
Forum provided an opportunity to learn about the role of government-backed initiatives to
support due diligence in the sector, and facilitated the sharing of lessons through sessions
on a broad range of due diligence topics including traceability, purchasing practices, worker
engagement, the role of financial institutions, SMEs, commercial contracts, alignment of
RBC initiatives in the sector and due diligence in the leather supply chain.
In 2018, the OECD Secretariat published translations of the guidance in French and
Chinese, and coordinated with the Polish and Japanese NCPs which both produced
translations in their respective languages. The OECD Secretariat also continued its
10

OECD (2018), OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains in the Garment
and Footwear Sector, see also the Recommendation of the Council on the OECD Due Diligence
Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains in the Garment and Footwear Sector
[OECD/LEGAL/0437].

engagement on crosscutting issues such as alignment, gender, meaningful stakeholder
engagement, and blockchain for transparency.

2.5.1. Engagement in key markets
In 2018, the OECD partnered with the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) to establish
an industry platform on responsible business conduct bringing together Indian
manufacturing businesses and global brands sourcing from India. The objective of the
platform is to address due diligence challenges and opportunities in Indian supply chains
through shared research and capacity building activities. Initial roundtables were held in
New Delhi and in Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, engaging national, local and regional
businesses and business associations, and establishing a programme of work for 2019.
The OECD signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU)11 with the China National
Textile and Apparel Council (CNTAC) at the Garment and Footwear Forum in January
2018. Through this agreement, China committed to developing and implementing sector
guidance that is aligned to the OECD’s due diligence guidance, and the OECD committed
to providing technical support. This will have a significant impact in expanding the reach
of RBC instruments in the industry, as China accounts for a 40% market share in the global
trade in textiles.

2.5.2. Capacity building on meaningful stakeholder engagement
While the Garment Guidance provides a framework for meaningful engagement with
workers, this can be a challenging process to navigate across diverse operating contexts
and risks in practice. In 2018, the OECD engaged with businesses and trade unions to build
capacity and provide an opportunity to share learnings on meaningful stakeholder
engagement, particularly within the context of global framework agreements. Within this
context, the OECD held a session at the Forum on Due Diligence in the Garment and
Footwear Sector which examined lessons learned from three cases studies in Bangladesh
and Turkey. The session included participants from Inditex, H&M, IndustriALL Global
Union and their affiliates. In 2018, the OECD continued to explore the practical application
of stakeholder engagement with trade unions and business at a meeting on global
framework agreements within Turkey and an OECD-H&M-IndustriALL workshop in
Cambodia.

2.5.3. Purchasing practices
The OECD Garment Guidance was the first government backed instrument to recognise
the role of due diligence applied to a company’s own purchasing practices. Within this
context, the OECD plays an important role in facilitating shared learnings on implementing
responsible purchasing practices. In 2018, the OECD hosted its second session on
responsible purchasing practices at the Garment Forum and introduced for the first time the
link between poor purchasing practices and environmental impacts. In June the EU and
OECD co-hosted a workshop on purchasing practices focusing on apparel brands sourcing
from Bangladesh, and including Bangladeshi manufacturers. Research was presented by
the ILO and Better Buying, followed by breakout discussion groups on thematic purchasing
practices issues led by representatives of ACT, Better Buying and industry initiatives,

Dhaka, Bangladesh in 2019.

2.6. Responsible Business Conduct in the financial sector
2.6.1. Clarifying expectations for banks
The project Responsible Business Conduct (RBC) in the Financial Sector aims to support
practitioners in the financial sector implement the OECD Guidelines. Under this project,
the OECD is currently developing guidance to identify due diligence approaches for banks
to ensure they adequately avoid and address adverse environmental and social impacts
associated with their clients in general corporate lending and securities underwriting
transactions. Currently no broadly recognised standard on environmental and social due
diligence exists for these transactions although they represent the majority of financing
activity by banks.
In 2018, the OECD organised two expert working sessions to collect input on this work:
one in New York City hosted by Citibank and one in London, hosted by UK Finance. These
working sessions, respectfully, brought together over 50 leading practitioners and experts
to share experience and develop consensus around practical and progressive due diligence
approaches for transactions of this nature.
Based on feedback provided by advisory group members to the project and other experts
the OECD has developed a draft paper on Due Diligence for responsible Business Conduct
in General Corporate Lending and Securities Underwriting. The paper provides guidance
on when enhanced due diligence can be triggered in the context of general corporate
lending and underwriting transactions, the role of banks in stakeholder engagement and
remediation, and how duties with respect to client confidentially can be respected
throughout the due diligence process. The paper will be finalised in 2019.
Various other initiatives are seeking to define the responsibility of banks with respect to
their financing activities. The OECD has been active in engaging with these processes to
ensure alignment with the due diligence approach recommended under the Guidelines. For
example, the OECD has been active in providing technical inputs to the Expert group on
Enabling Remediation of the Dutch Banking Sector Agreement (DBA) on International
Responsible Business Conduct Regarding Human Rights. The OECD has been active in
providing technical input to the revision of the Equator Principles (EP) through members
of the EP Association to strengthen linkages to the due diligence process and in the
development of the UN-EP FI Principles for Responsible Banking.12 The OECD’s ongoing
work on due diligence in the banking sector was also featured at the 2018 UN Forum on
Business and Human Rights.

Designed to reflect the PRI, this instrument includes six high-level principles and a reporting
expectation of signatories. For more information see http://www.unepfi.org/wordpress/wpcontent/uploads/2018/12/PRB-consultation-brochure.pdf

2.6.2. Promoting RBC due diligence for institutional investors
The OECD has been active in promoting its
recommendations on RBC for institutional investors13 in
collaboration with delegates and key partners. For example
the OECD organised workshops on due diligence for
institutional investment during the Global Pension Dialogue
in Amsterdam,14 Roundtable on Responsible Investment in
Vienna, Annual Corporate Social Responsibility
Conference of Cyprus15, Conference on Initiatives for
Sustainable Global Value Chains organized by the European
Social and Economic Committee in Brussles, and as a cohost of a conference on ESG Investing with the Thai
Government Pension Fund in Bangkok.
As a result in 2018 the OECD’s due diligence approach was
underscored by various key actors. For example, the
European Parliament called on European Commission to introduce a mandatory due
diligence framework based on the OECD’s paper on Responsible Business Conduct for
Institutional Investors.16 In this respect the European Parliament also proposed strong
references to OECD recommendations on due diligence for institutional investors in the
context of the draft EU regulation on Investor Disclosure currently being negotiated ta the
level of the EU.17

The Dutch Pension Fund Agreement, introduced in December of 2018 likewise recognizes
the OECD’s recommendations on RBC for institutional investors as the basis for their
approach to environmental and social risk management.18
In December of this year the PRI called on the OECD to engage in follow up work on RBC
for institutional investors by engaging with other relevant committees at the OECD to
integrate sustainable finance and investment into research agendas and dialogue amongst
policy makers.19 In this respect collaboration between the RBC unit and Center for Green
Finance has been ongoing throughout 2018 and has resulted in strong references to the due
diligence framework in the context of events and publications developed by the center.
The 2019 Business and Finance Outlook, the annual flagship publication of the OECD
Directorate will include a chapter on Trust in Financial Institutions which will highlight
how RBC can enable trust in financial institutions and present trends with respect to policy
approaches to promoting RBC in the financial sector. Initial research and drafting of this
chapter took place in the second half of 2018.

2.7. Highlights of projects in specific sectors
Responsible supply chains of minerals from conflict-affected and high-risk areas
Key outcomes

The London Metal Exchange (LME) announced due diligence requirements aligned with the OECD Minerals Guidance for
brands delivering metals on the exchange in a position paper in October 2018 The LME action will help reinforcing global
convergence of efforts, and mutual recognition and efficiency as a result.
A capacity building exercise on the OECD Minerals Guidance for all stakeholders in the supply chains (business,
government and civil society) was launched in Colombia using a train-the-trainer approach. The lessons learnt from the
programme in Colombia will inform similar capacity building projects in West Africa and Central Africa in 2019.
The Informal Advisory Group on Results measurement was formed to help the Secretariat develop a monitoring and
evaluation framework to measure the outcomes of the implementation of the OECD Minerals Guidance. The Informal
Advisory Group held its first meeting in late 2018, and is formed by academics and development practitioners with
expertise in monitoring and evaluation in conflict-affected and high-risk areas.
Outreach to stakeholders in the cobalt industry clarified the applicability of the OECD Guidance to all actors in the supply
chain. It was also agreed that fine refiners are the control point in the supply chain as per the OECD Guidance, where third
party audits should take place.
Engagement with stakeholders in the diamond supply chain led to consultations with various industry bodies and initiatives
on the revision of standards and policies to increase alignment with the OECD Minerals Guidance.

Chapter 3.
Policy action to promote and enable Responsible Business Conduct

3.1. Moving toward policy coherence remains a trend in 2018
This chapter summarises policy action in support of responsible business conduct (RBC)
in 2018 and gives an overview of concrete examples of how the OECD has supported
integration of RBC in other policy areas. A common theme has been a strong focus on
action in face of global challenges, as well as moving toward policy coherence. The OECD
Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises (the OECD Guidelines) are a core framework for
these efforts, notably considering the practical nature of various OECD Due Diligence
Guidances, which are a key tool for reaching out to business, but also the role of NCPs in
promoting coherence and providing a venue for resolution of issues. The OECD’s value
add is unique in terms of its mandate, which covers a wide range of policy areas where
technical experts from governments work together to share experiences and set
international standards relating to economic policies that have a bearing on RBC. This
evidence-based approach to policy making is complemented by various efforts to
implement the OECD Guidelines as well as further evidence of what works in practice
collected in the context of regional programmes, in particular in Asia.
Developments in 2018 point to an increasing focus among governments to promote policy
coherence on RBC and to integrate RBC in other policy areas. The value-added of using
OECD Guidelines as a core framework for these efforts is notable as the Guidelines
promote RBC across the entire spectrum of issues where business operations intersect with
society, including labour and human rights, but also corruption, environment, consumer
protection, taxation, and others. A strong policy framework that is clear on what is expected
on RBC can both bring more clarity to the market and to businesses but also assist
governments align internal objectives of all agencies that work with the private sector or
engage in economic activities using public funds, such as public procurement offices or
development financing agencies and institutions.
Achieving policy coherence was a central theme of the 2018 OECD-hosted Roundtable for
Policy Makers on RBC (the Roundtable). The Roundtable, which has taken place since
2015 as part of the Global Forum on Responsible Business Conduct (GFRBC), is designed
to address concrete challenges policy makers face in designing and implementing RBCrelated policies and instruments. Specific topics addressed in 2018 included: the role of
National Action Plans (NAPs) on Business and Human Rights or RBC in enabling policy
coherence; the role of NCPs and national human rights institutions (NHRIs) in RBC policy
making; the role of governments in promoting due diligence, as well as three deep-dive
sessions, on RBC in government procurement practices, development finance and cooperation, and the OECD Framework on Policy Coherence for Sustainable Development.
The session on NAPs, which was once again jointly organised with the UN Working Group
on Business and Human Rights, showed that elaborating (and concluding) a NAP is an

-----------------------Page 68 End-----------------------

3. POLICY ACTION TO PROMOTE AND ENABLE RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS CONDUCT

effective way to unifying national efforts on RBC. Given the broad scope of RBC, two
elements in the development of NAPs were highlighted by various governments to be
particularly helpful in framing efforts and achieving a successful outcome. Namely, this
included 1) using baseline assessments to develop an evidence-based NAP that responds to
key challenges, rather than to perceived challenges; and 2) ensuring an action-oriented and
not solely descriptive NAP.1
As of January 2019, 22 countries have adopted a NAP and four countries are in the process
of developing one – all of which are Adherents to the OECD Guidelines (see table 3.1
below). In 2018, Luxembourg and Slovenia adopted a NAP for the first time. Both NAPs
rely on the OECD Guidelines as a core framework, and place emphasis on the NCPs as a
key mechanism to promoting access to remedy. The first iteration of the Luxembourg NAP,
covering a period of 18 months (2018-2019), sets out a work programme which will be
assessed by an Inter-ministerial Committee for Human Rights, with a view to reflect on
next phases and a draft 2020-21 NAP by the end of 2019.2 Similarly, Slovenia established
an interdepartmental working group, of which the NCP is a member, to report and
implement the activities of the NAP. Colombia and Lithuania are currently in the process
of updating their respective NAPs and more actively including the NCPs in this process.
Although the NAP process in Brazil is paused at this stage, a presidential Decree was issued
in November 2018, establishing National Guidelines on Business and Human Rights for
Brazilian medium and large companies, including multinational enterprises operating in
Brazil. The Decree is non-binding and calls on companies to internally disseminate
corporate responsibility instruments, including the OECD Guidelines.3 At the initial stage
of the NAP formulation process to conduct the baseline study, Japan organised multistakeholder meetings.
Implementation and monitoring of NAPs has continued in a number of countries and NCPs
have been closely involved in these processes. For example, the Italian NCP participated
in the mid-term review of the Italian NAP. For the purpose of the implementation of the
NAP in Chile, at the end of 2018, the civil society committee of the NCP was merged with
the NAP multi-stakeholder advisory body, thereby sending a strong signal on policy
coherence within the Government.
Recent OECD Investment Policy Reviews recommend to governments under review to
adopt a NAP based on good international practice even if they are not an OECD Guidelines
Adherents. The OECD has been providing support in this regard in the framework of the
EU-funded programme on Promoting Responsible Supply Chains in Asia (see Box 3.1).
For example, the OECD presented various elements of RBC work at the request of the
Royal Government of Thailand during the Bangkok Business and Human Rights Week in
June 2018, including how NCPs function. The Government of Thailand is currently
elaborating a NAP.

3. POLICY ACTION TO PROMOTE AND ENABLE RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS CONDUCT

The importance of policy coherence was also reinforced in a number of sessions at the 2018
GFRBC, notably by the business community. The 6th edition of the GFRBC
(20-21 June 2018) brought together over 750 participants, mostly from businesses but also
representatives from 60 governments and various UN agencies.4 Participants discussed a
wide range of topics in over 35 sessions. During the opening plenary session that focused
on the purpose of business in society, panellists called on governments to not shy away
from their responsibilities to ensure that businesses operate in a responsible manner. As
experience shows, governments have a range of tools at their disposal, including for
example, providing incentives through procurement policies or licensing processes
favourable to businesses with strong due diligence approaches, providing resources and
guidance to companies to conduct due diligence, or introducing regulations with respect to
RBC. The “toolbox” for governments has expanded significantly since the 2011 revision
to the OECD Guidelines. The wide consensus build around the new OECD Due Diligence
Guidance for Responsible Business Conduct was highlighted as an important opportunity
for governments in terms of implementation. The session on Promoting due diligence: the
role of Governments also echoed this message - experience shows that promoting
uniformity and clarity around expectations on due diligence is an important element of how
successful various regulatory and policy directives are.5
Furthermore, policy coherence on RBC is relevant in the context of the Sustainable
Development Goals (SDGs). The importance of RBC for achieving the SDGs is being
recognised on regional and country levels. On 30 January 2019, the European Commission
issued a Reflection Paper Towards a Sustainable Europe by 2030 which sets out key policy
foundations and horizontal enablers for achieving the SDGs.6 The paper was elaborated
over the course of 2018 and it incorporates input from the High-Level Multi-stakeholder
Platform on the SDGs, where OECD participated as an observer and provided inputs on
RBC. The paper also incorporates the work by the Commission on the Action Plan on
Sustainable Finance and the ongoing developments in this regard, which has been informed
by the OECD’s work on RBC and institutional investors and Centre for Green Finance.
(For more information, see Chapter 2).
The Reflection Paper notably recognises RBC as a horizontal enabler for the sustainability
transition and puts forward three scenarios for stimulating a discussion on how the EU
could follow up on the SDGs, e.g. through an overarching EU SDGs strategy guiding the
actions of the EU and its Member States, by continuing mainstreaming the SDGs in all
relevant EU policies, and through an enhanced focus on external action.
Similar reflections are taking place at the country level. For example, in September 2018,
the Dutch Minister of Foreign Trade and Development Cooperation asked the Social and
Economic Council of the Netherlands to provide advice to the Government on the
relationship between the SDGs, RBC, more sustainable global value chains and publicprivate partnerships, and what this means for businesses and government. The request for
advice is linked to the new policy for Foreign Trade and Development Cooperation. The
SDGs form the framework for that policy, with cooperation and an increased role for the
private sector emphasized in terms of its implementation. Poland also includes RBC issues
as part of its national SDG implementation plan, Strategy for Sustainable Development.

3.1.1. Promoting responsible supply chains in Asia
2018 also saw the launch of the regional EU-funded programme on Promoting Responsible
Supply Chains in Asia, which includes activities to promote policy coherence on RBC and
increase stakeholders, notably businesses, but also civil society, worker representatives and
academics, understanding of OECD recommendations on due diligence and responsible supply
chains. The programme, implemented in collaboration with the ILO and funded by the
European Union, covers activities in six countries in the region: Japan (OECD Member), China
(Key Partner country), Thailand, Myanmar, the Philippines, and Viet Nam. In 2018, activities
focused primarily on building partnerships with relevant stakeholders and initiatives on the
ground, notably with government agencies and businesses and associations in specific sectors,
such as electronics in China or agriculture in Southeast Asia (see Box 3.1).
Box 3.1. EU-ILO-OECD Programme on Promoting Responsible Supply Chains in Asia

The programme activities started in January 2018 and will continue until 2020. The programme
was initially publicised at the EU-ASEAN Business Summit in March 2018 by the EU Trade
Commissioner and launched at a high-level by the OECD Secretary General at the June 2018
Global Forum on RBC. The forum also included a dedicated session with high-level
participation from Japan, China, Myanmar, and Thailand, as well as the EU and the ILO.
The OECD organised several events and integrated RBC components in events organised in
the countries under other OECD workstreams. Examples include co-hosting a seminar in Japan
in October with Keidanren and the ILO on Responsible Business of Japanese Companies and
their Supply Chains. The translated Japanese version of the OECD Due Diligence Guidance
on RBC is expected to be launched in the first half of 2019, with activities to support the
promotion and implementation of the Guidance in Japan planned for 2019 and 2020 under the
Programme.
In China, the OECD organised a technical seminar in December 2018 to raise awareness of
key RBC concepts. The Chinese version of the Due Diligence Guidance for RBC is underway
and is expected to be completed by first half of 2019. A study on RBC in China is also being
prepared together with partners.
Thailand and the OECD signed an enhanced co-operation programme in May 2018 and RBC is
featured as a key area of co-operation. The OECD co-organised the ASEAN Inter-regional
Dialogue on Business and Human Rights on 4-6 June 2018 and a conference for business on
“Strengthening responsible business conduct through international standards” together with the
Thai Ministry of Justice and Joint Standing Committee on Commerce Industry and Banking
(JSCCIB), the main Thai business association. In Myanmar, the Ministry of Planning and
Investment and the OECD launched a second Investment Policy Review of Myanmar in July 2018.
Missions to Viet Nam and the Philippines took place in February and October respectively and
included participation of the OECD at the EU-Philippines Business Summit held in Manila in
October 2018 and several preparatory meetings with the governments and relevant
stakeholders regarding future activities. The 2018 Investment Policy Review of Viet Nam was
finalised in 2018 and the regional programme on RBC was presented at the November OECDASEAN event on Making Agro-Food Markets Work for ASEAN.*

3.2. Integrating RBC in specific policy areas
One way to build coherence and collaboration on RBC is by making a link between RBC
and existing policy areas. The OECD brings valued added in this regard since OECD’s
mandate covers a wide range of policy areas, in which technical experts from governments
work together to share experiences and set international standards relating to economic
policies that have a bearing on RBC. In 2018, integration of RBC in specific policy areas
continued in areas where the state acts as an economic actor.

3.2.1. Leveraging public procurement for RBC
Expectations are growing for governments to spend public money in a responsible way and
ensure supply chain due diligence of public procurement. Public procurement in OECD
Member countries represents on average 12% of GDP and 29% of the national budget, with
two thirds of this expenditure occurring at the sub-national levels.7 In September 2018, a
group of countries led by the United Kingdom launched the Principles To Guide
Government Action To Combat Human Trafficking in Global Supply Chains,8 calling on
responsible government procurement practices. Similarly, the G20 Labour and
Employment Ministerial meeting Declaration of 6-7 September 2018, called on countries
to: “utilize public procurement to improve compliance with labour standards, in
coordination with other government agencies. Government purchases of goods and services
represent a significant share of the global economy. We will exchange best practices on
public procurement, government contracting and responsible government-backed
financing.”9
Following on earlier discussions at the OECD on how to further RBC through public
procurement, and in addition to a deep-dive session at the Policy Makers Roundtable in
2018, an expert meeting took place in June 2018 bringing together public procurement
practitioners, policy makers and other experts. The meeting highlighted again the
increasing need for practitioners and policy makers to share learning and best practice,
spread tools, exchange information on risks related to certain products and markets and
share information on follow-up and monitoring. In response to the expert meeting and to
implement the international calls for action, the OECD developed a proposal to launch a
work programme on Responsible Business Conduct and Public Procurement setting out
objectives, proposed activities and funding priorities for its implementation over 20192020. The proposal was discussed, welcomed and approved by both the OECD Working
Party on Leading Practitioners of Public Procurement (WPLPP), as well as the WPRBC in
2018. Work is planned for 2019-2020, pending funding .

3.2.2. Integrating RBC in development financing and co-operation efforts
Public resources are also used in the context of development finance and co-operation.
Concepts like blended finance, development impact bonds, social impact investing, and
other innovative programmes to support public-private partnerships have gained more

focus since the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were adopted in 2015.10
Governments are increasingly looking at best ways to engage the private sector in the
context of development policy and at how public financing could be used to mobilise
private capital and support private sector activity in achieving the SDGs.
Participants at the 2017 Global Forum on RBC had called on the OECD to make the link
between RBC and development finance and co-operation more explicit. Although the
OECD Guidelines pre-date the SDGs, their purpose is aligned with the ambition of the
SDGs to encourage positive contributions of the private sector to sustainable development.
A deep-dive session for policy makers on this topic was held at the 2018 Roundtable. It
featured examples of how governments are integrating RBC in their development policies
and practices, including in the context of traditional development lending models and in
new financing structures. It also specifically looked at the ways that governments could
support integration of RBC due diligence in the work and ongoing due diligence efforts of
development financing institutions (DFIs), be it in their lending practices but also in
provision of technical support on the ground.
The main takeaway from the discussion was that RBC and development policy are
complementary in three main ways. First, RBC due diligence can complement and support
the ongoing due diligence efforts by public institutions that finance development. Second,
integrating RBC expectations in new and innovating financing models for financing the
2030 Agenda, including in blended finance, would be a practical way to connect policy
objectives between these two areas. Additionally, it would help maximise the development
impact of new types of financing while also addressing the risks of adverse impacts on the
people and the planet. Third, development agencies can use RBC to shape their broader
efforts as related to private sector development and broader contribution of the private
sector to sustainable development and the SDGs.
A number of governments have started making these connections in practice. For example,
NORAD, the Norwegian development agency, completed an evaluation exercise in 2018
to understand how human rights are promoted, protected and respected in Norwegian
development cooperation that involves business. The evaluation assessed the systems and
performance of six Norwegian public entities in Norwegian development cooperation,
namely the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA), Norway’s embassies, the Norwegian
Agency for Development Cooperation (Norad), Norfund, the Norwegian Export Credit
Guarantee Agency (GIEK) and Innovation Norway. The evaluation also included two
country case studies, Tanzania and Mozambique, and based the findings from five projects
in each country. The result found that Norway’s aid administration strongly communicates
about business and human rights, however, that there are still gaps in practice in how these
commitments are implemented.11
The findings of a recent stocktaking by the OECD (2018b) on Promoting RBC through
development co-operation efforts supports a similar conclusion.12 Many donor agencies and
10

The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development explicitly calls for mobilising the private sector
in achieving the SDGs, which means that public and private financing and objectives are expected
to increasingly intersect in the coming years.

3. POLICY ACTION TO PROMOTE AND ENABLE RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS CONDUCT

DFIs have taken steps to promote, incentivise and exemplify RBC, but there is significant
scope to mainstream RBC within institutions. OECD’s ongoing work in this regard was
presented at the 2018 UN Forum on Business and Human Rights.
In 2018, the DAC issued the OECD DAC Blended Finance Principles for Unlocking
Commercial Finance for the Sustainable Development Goals which recognise that quality
in the design and execution of projects financed by development finance are central to the
objective of supporting the development of functioning and effective markets and which
call on blended finance to “based on high corporate governance, environmental and social
standards, as well as internationally recognised responsible business conduct instruments
[…]”.13 Additionally, the importance of RBC was highlighted in the OECD Global Outlook
on Financing for Sustainable Development 2019which explicitly called on governments to
promote RBC in order to harness the potential of private sector resources for the SDGs.14

3.2.3. Sustainable finance and corporate governance
The OECD sets out guidelines for policymakers to evaluate and improve the legal,
regulatory, and institutional framework for corporate governance, including also for
corporate governance of State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs). The OECD also has a number
of standards that shape financial markets and deal with institutions acting in a fiduciary
capacity, e.g. pension funds.
In the context of global challenges like climate, inequality, poverty, and need the for
sustainable development, governments have been assessing at the national level the role of
the private sector in addressing them, and notably, whether and how corporate law and
corporate models are a barrier for sustainability transition. For example, France elaborated
a draft law PACTE in 2018 (The Action Plan for Enterprise Growth and Transformation),15
which includes proposals on how the legal definitions of companies could be adapted to
strengthen their relationship with the general interest and society.
In May 2018, the European Commission adopted a package of measures to implement
actions announced in its Action Plan on Sustainable Finance, notably a proposal for a
number of regulations (e.g. to unify what can be considered environmentally sustainable
economic activity; to set out disclosure obligations on how institutional investors and asset
managers integrate environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors in their risk
processes; to create a new category of benchmarks on low-carbon and positive carbon
impacts to provide investors with better information).
These initiatives all aim to address both the responsibility but also the opportunity for
business in face of major global challenges. The OECD is particularly well placed to assist
its members with considering these questions. Its various committees that deal with

financial and enterprise affairs are both standard setting bodies but also practitioners with
experience in each policy areas that intersect. In December 2018, Principles for
Responsible Investment (PRI) issued recommendations to the OECD on how to further
promote and align policy advice related to corporate governance, the financial sector and
investment in support of the Paris Agreement and the SDGs. The Aligning Investors with
Sustainable Finance: A focus on the OECD report recognises that more could be done to
harness and finance and investment to support sustainable development.16.
In 2018, the OECD has also addressed the broader question of the contribution of business
in face of global challenges in several related areas, all of which build on and reference
RBC. For example, OECD Statistics published a working paper in 2018 on Measuring the
impact of businesses on people’s well-being and sustainability: Taking stock of existing
frameworks and initiatives.17 The working paper aims to better understand how businesses
can impact people’s well-being and sustainability, using OECD’s well-being framework
and Better Life Initiative as a starting point. The OECD has also launched a platform for
Business for Inclusive Growth in order to explore and further incubate ideas for how
businesses can help address inclusive growth challenges and a new business model.18
SOEs also have a role to play in terms of meeting the SDGs. RBC expectations applicable
to SOEs, but so far there has been limited research on how widespread RBC practices are
among SOEs. In some countries, governments have taken various steps to address this
challenge. For example, Brazil has reported in its annual OECD NCP questionnaire that in
November 2018 some of the largest Brazilian SOEs issued a letter confirming their
commitment to advance human rights in their operations. The OECD is also promoting
RBC in SOEs as part of its ongoing work in Asia, and has featured its various standards in
this regard at the 2018 UN Forum on Business and Human Rights. For example, in April
2018, the OECD collaborated with Thailand, UNDP and the National Human Rights
Commission of Thailand on a High-level Forum on Leading by Example: Thai State-owned
Enterprises towards the Role Model of Responsible Business. The 11th Meeting of the
OECD Asia Network on Corporate Governance of State-owned Enterprises, which took
place on 6-7 September in Hyderabad, India, focused on stocktaking of national practices
on RBC. The summary report is expected to be published in 2019.

3.2.4. Deepening evidence on the benefits of integrating RBC in investment
policy
The inclusion of RBC as a core element of OECD Investment Policy Reviews continued in
2018. Since the update of the OECD Policy Framework for Investment in 2015
[C/MIN(2015)6/FINAL] and the decision by the OECD Investment Committee in 2016 to
place a particular emphasis on RBC issues in reviews of candidate countries for adherence
to the OECD Declaration on International Investment and Multinational Enterprises, more

than ten reviews now include a detailed chapter on Promoting and Enabling RBC.19 These
reviews collectively represent a new body of work on how a focus on RBC can help
governments maximise the benefits of investment in their economies.
The reviews generally involve several missions to the country, multiple meetings with
relevant parts of the government and stakeholders, an inclusive and iterative report writing
process (which includes wide stakeholder consultations), and visits from government
officials to the OECD. Three consultation workshops on RBC and/or NCPs were organised
in the countries under review in 2018, in direct co-operation with authorities and relevant
stakeholders (Zagreb, Croatia on 18 January 2018; Nay Pyi Taw, Myanmar on 7 July 2018;
Bangkok, Thailand on 17-18 September 2018). These events were an opportunity to discuss
RBC with a wide range of government officials and raise awareness about RBC with other
groups, such as businesses, workers organisations and civil society. The OECD also
participated in two conferences on investment policy in Cairo, Egypt (organised in the
framework of the EU-OECD Programme on Promoting Investment in the Mediterranean
as well as the MENA Transition Fund project on “Enhancing the Investment Climate in
Egypt”), where RBC was presented.
The OECD hosted at the 2018 GFRBC the first meeting of the Policy Network on FDI
qualities, which supports the new policy work on measuring FDI qualities, launched in
March 2018 under the auspices of the Investment Committee. The objective of this project
is to develop a toolbox to equip policymakers with a set of actionable tools guiding
countries to mobilise FDI that maximises inclusive and sustainable growth and supports
progress towards the SDGs. RBC was also discussed at the third workshop of the OECD
Investment Promotion Agencies Network on 22 October 2018 on Maximising the benefits
of FDI through investment promotion and facilitation. 17 Adherents to the OECD
Guidelines reported that they communicated about NCP specific instances received in 2018
to officials responsible for foreign trade and investment incentives.
On the occasion of the 2018 GFRBC, the Columbia Center on Sustainable Investment
organised an exploratory seminar at the OECD on the connection between investment
treaties and RBC. This follows the call by stakeholders for additional work in this area. The
OECD will work further on this issue in 2019 in the framework of its various projects on
inclusive and sustainable development and investment.
The trends to include RBC criteria in trade and investment agreements has continued
throughout 2018. For example, in October 2018, the Netherlands adopted a new
Model Bilateral Investment Treaty, which not only incorporates expectations on RBC, but
also links observance of the OECD Guidelines and the UN Guiding Principles to dispute
settlement. Another example is the EU-Japan Economic Partnership Agreement (which
entered into force on 1 February 2019) which specifically refers to the Guidelines in the
chapter on trade and sustainable development. The 2018 EU-Mexico agreement on trade
(“agreement in principle” announced on 21 April 2018 as part of the envisaged update of
the broader EU-Mexico Global Agreement) also integrates a dedicated provision on RBC
with a reference to the Guidelines in the chapter on trade and sustainable development,
introduces a new dialogue with civil society in all areas of the agreement, as well as
represents the first time the EU included provisions to fight corruption in a trade agreement,
with measures to act against bribery and money laundering. Chile has also announced that

it is modernising its agreements with the EU, Brazil and in the context of the Pacific
Alliance and that the NCP is a part of these discussions. Peru equally reported the inclusion
of RBC and Guidelines references in the Pacific Alliance agreement on investment.
Beyond trade and investment agreements, government are taking various practical steps to
promote RBC abroad. Canada announced in January 2018 that it will build out its
international RBC strategy by creating an Ombudsperson on responsible business (which
will have investigative powers) and a multi-stakeholder advisory body to provide advice.
The government considers these initiatives to be complementary with the NCP mandate
(e.g. the Ombudsperson may refer cases to the NCP for formal mediation).20
Another example is Austria’s 2018 National Strategy on Foreign Trade, which includes a
dedicated chapter on RBC and references in other chapters. The Austrian NCP has also
reported that it regularly informs officials responsible for trade missions, the Austrian
Export Credit Agency and the Austrian Development Bank, about NCP activities and
specific instances. In the same vein, Germany adopted a new procedure in July 2018 for
organising trade missions. All businesses that want to join trade missions are now be
required to sign a statement on RBC (which refers to the OECD Guidelines and the NCP).
12 Adherents to the OECD Guidelines reported that communicated about NCP specific
instances received in 2018 to officials responsible for trade missions.

3.2.5. Infrastructure
Another area in 2018 which benefitted from more focus was infrastructure. Development
of infrastructure is both an explicit SDG as well as a critical factor for achieving other
SDGs. The UN estimates that 2.3 billion people still do not have access to simple sanitation
and almost 800 million lack access to water. In many parts of the world, digital
infrastructure does not exist at all. 1.2 billion people do not have reliable phone service and
just under 1 billion people lack access to electricity.21 Even where infrastructure does exist,
economic loses from aging assets and challenges related to financing and adapting them to
be climate-compatible are significant challenges for governments.
The OECD (2017) estimates that USD 6.3 trillion is required annually on average until
2030 to meet infrastructure development needs globally. An additional USD 0.6
trillion/year will make these investments climate-compatible.22 Financing infrastructure,
however, is only one aspect of ensuring that socio-economic and sustainable development
needs are met. Without a broad and balanced consideration of environmental, social, and
governance, along with economic criteria, infrastructure projects and the communities
where they are being developed are under significant risk. Infrastructure projects are
complex, with long supply chains and many stakeholders, and are highly vulnerable to

corruption and negative social and environmental impacts. The 2016 OECD Foreign
Bribery Report shows that almost 60% of foreign bribery cases occurred in four sectors
related to infrastructure, with executives of SOEs and other associated parties the most
common bribe recipients.
Getting and keeping the social license to operate is also an underestimated and under-priced
risk.23 The costs for communities are often even higher and more serious. Land-consuming
industries (such as mining, agribusiness, oil, gas and coal and dam construction) remained
deadliest for human rights defenders in 2018 according to the UN Special Rapporteur on
the Situation of Human Rights Defenders.24 The UN Office of the High Commissioner for
Human Rights (2018) has cautioned that without explicitly and systematically
acknowledging and addressing the sustainability and human rights gap in infrastructure
policy frameworks and practices, at best - the enormous potential of infrastructure as a
facilitator for SDGs will not be realised, and at worst - infrastructure development will
actually undermine the SDGs.
Integrating RBC in the infrastructure project life-cycle can be a practical way for
governments to balance economic, social and environmental objectives during preparation,
financing and delivery of infrastructure and for private sector participants to know and
show they are addressing their most significant impacts on communities and the
environment.
The OECD Business and Finance Outlook 2018 emphasised that in the context of a new
phase of globalisation (with Asia/Eurasia and China’s Belt and Road Initiative as a case
study) RBC is critical to ensuring that infrastructure investment contributes to sustainable
development, and used evidence from NCP cases to show that ensuring an adequate
framework for investment and promoting and enabling RBC is important for developed
and developing economies alike. 25 The experience from the NCP specific instances also
shows this to be case. 14% of NCP specific instances since 2001 concern infrastructure,
with a notable rise in recent specific instances on issues related to renewable energy, e.g.
in particular human rights, land acquisitions and indigenous peoples customary land rights.
Most cases concerned the mining and quarrying sector, with remainder related to
construction, financing and insurance; transportation and storage; and electricity, gas,
stream and air conditions supply. More than half of these cases were raised in non-Adherent
countries.
The OECD has cooperated with its Members and other international organisations to
promote quality infrastructure investment. Notably, in September 2018, the OECD coorganised a Seminar on Quality Infrastructure Investment with the Japanese Ministry of
Finance and the World Bank, in cooperation with the World Bank’s Tokyo Development
23

Inter-American Development Bank (2017) analysed 200 projects across six sectors in Latin
America and the Caribbean that were strongly opposed by local communities and found that a lack
of a multi-dimensional approach in project planning, design, and delivery was seriously detrimental

faced delays; and 116 faced cost overruns. IADB (2017), Lessons from Four Decades of

standards were discussed and presented.26 Additionally, a presentation on RBC was
included in OECD hosted workshop in November 2018 on Innovation, Standardization and
Data Collection for Long-Term Investment, supporting the G20/OECD Task Force on
Institutional Investors and Long-term Financing, as well as the meeting of the Steering
Committee of the Infrastructure Data Initiative.27
Finally, in October 2018, the OECD Secretariat hosted a seminar with the OHCHR and the
Heinrich Böll Foundation to present a forthcoming publication Other Infrastructure Gap:
Sustainability – Human Rights and Environmental Dimensions.28 The publication analyses
the potential gains from integrating RBC in plans and projects, as well as the cost of failing
to do so, drawing from mega-infrastructure project experience in the energy, transportation
and water sectors. It examines two key aspects of infrastructure development in relative
detail: the legal framework governing international investment, and the shifting landscape
of infrastructure finance.

3.3. RBC in thematic areas
The OECD Guidelines cover a broad range of topics, including environment, human rights,
labour issues, etc. Within those, specific issues have been given particular attention in 2018,
including forced labour and human trafficking, and gender. The 70th anniversary of the
Declaration on Human Rights was celebrated all over the world with hundreds of events
(see Box 3.2.).
Box 3.2. Commemorating the 70th Anniversary of the Universal Declaration on Human
Rights

To commemorate the 70th anniversary of the signing of the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights (Paris, 10 December 1948) and to join the hundreds of events held
worldwide on this occasion, the OECD undertook a multilayer, multichannel
communications campaign aimed at different stakeholders to highlight the mainstreaming
of human rights across work on RBC.
An internal OECD seminar event was organised on the 6 December 2018 to raise
awareness on the role of RBC in helping ensure that businesses respect human rights in
their practices and across supply chains. The event included a key note speech by Christine
Kaufmann and internal discussion from different parts of OECD on how human rights cuts
across their work streams (e.g. environment, export credits, development, statistics, etc.)
A website dedicated to human rights as part of RBC was created to house key documents
on the theme including a concept note, short impact videos, as well as a blog written by the
newly elected Chair and the outgoing Chair of the WPRBC, Christine Kaufmann and Roel
Nieuwenkamp.

1.1.1. Eradicating forced labour, modern slavery, human trafficking and child labour
ILO estimates that 89 million people experienced some form of modern slavery over the
past five years. In 2016 alone - on any given day - 40.3 million people were victims, with
24.9 million forced to work under threat or coercion. In November 2018, the OECD joined
Alliance 8.7, a global network of more than 200 partners that have come together to work
toward accelerated action to end forced labour, modern slavery, human trafficking and
child labour. The OECD will contribute its expertise on due diligence and data
measurement and will support the platform with exchanging of data, information,
innovation and good practice. Concretely, the OECD has already engaged in discussions
with the Alliance 8.7 research consortium and will provide a substantive contribution to the
report on Child Labour and Forced Labour in Supply Chains to be presented to the G20 in
September 2019.29
Policy developments in Member countries on this topic are also notable. On 29 November
2018, Australia passed a Modern Slavery Act, which will require businesses based or
operating in Australia to report annually on the risks of modern slavery in their operations
and supply chains, as well as the actions they have taken to address those risks. The Act
applies to businesses with $100+ million revenue, but it invites other entities to report
voluntarily. The statements will be published in a public repository. The government itself
is expected to report on its own activities (Australia, 2018)30. This landmark law follows
earlier legislative developments in the UK, France, US and the EU related to modern
slavery, transparency in global supply chains, and disclosure. Notably, in July 2018, the
UK Home Secretary, at the request of the Prime Minister, announced an independent
review of the 2015 Modern Slavery Act (UK, 2018).31 The recommendations of the
reviewers are expected in March 2019.

3.3.1. Gender
The OECD continued its work on mainstreaming gender in its supply chain due diligence
work throughout 2018. In the garment and footwear supply chain for example, women
account for the majority of the labour force and the Garment Due Diligence Guidance
recognises that risks of harm may be different for women than for men. This is also
reflected in agriculture where women are a crucial resource in all regions of the world
through their role as farmers, labourers and entrepreneurs. According to the FAO (2011
data), women account for 43% of the labour force, with over 80% in certain parts of the

Tackling Modern Slavery in Supply Chains was also a dedicated session in the 2018 GFRBC.
Panellists highlighted that forced labour and trafficking are fundamentally about criminal profit,
corruption, money laundering and even tax evasion. The “follow the money” approach can disrupt
criminal profits significantly; in this respect the role of financial sector due diligence and
government action on public procurement were highlighted as opportunities. In some countries,
structural issues associated with legal immigration processes can also contribute to abuse (e.g. visa
restrictions).

value chain such as post-harvesting activities in the seafood sector. Women are more likely
to be paid lower wages than men, to be in precarious or informal employment, and more
vulnerable to harassment in the workplace and other vulnerabilities, which may in fact be
accumulated and overlapping.
Almost everywhere, women face more severe constraints than men in accessing productive
resources and decision making. The need for companies to recognise and take into account
the particular vulnerability of women workers when carrying out due diligence was also
included in the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Business Conduct.
Specifically, companies should help eliminate discrimination against women; enhance their
meaningful participation in decision-making and leadership roles, and facilitate equal
access and control over natural resources, financial services, markets and information. This
topic was explored in various panel events throughout the year, including the OECD Global
Forum on RBC and the OECD DAF March on Gender. A dedicated session on Addressing
harassment complaints in the workplace was organised in March 2018 during the OECD
DAF March on Gender. The session asked what happens next – considering sexual
misconduct and harassment have made headlines many times in 2018 – and how
international standards on RBC can help promote a safe, respectful and equal environment,
in the context of access to remedy and due process for victims.
Furthermore, widespread sexual violence is specifically addressed as one of the serious
human rights violations included in the OECD Due Diligence Guidance on Responsible
Mineral Supply Chains. Implementation of on-the-ground due diligence systems and multistakeholder monitoring aims to ensure that such abuses are identified and addressed over
time, including in conflict-affected and high-risk areas, such as the Democratic Republic
of the Congo.
The voice of women is also incorporated into the multi-stakeholder implementation
programmes of the supply chain due diligence sector projects. While for example the
extractives sector can be considered male-dominated, the track record of gender balance at
OECD-ICGLR-UN Forum meetings is generally positive with an estimated 40% female
participation. The OECD again in 2018 sponsored the attendance of female civil society
representatives across sectors. Women are also well represented at the governance level of
the OECD sector implementation programmes, holding key leadership roles in various
multi-stakeholder steering groups.

Chapter 4.
Stakeholder engagement

Stakeholder engagement is a defining characteristic of Responsible Business Conduct
(RBC) as set out in the Guidelines. The OECD sector-specific and general due diligence
instruments also underline the importance of meaningful stakeholder engagement
throughout the due diligence process. As such, systematic involvement of stakeholders is
ingrained in the OECD’s approach to promote RBC. Since 1976, stakeholders have played
a critical role in drawing attention to areas in RBC in need of improvement, bringing
specific instances to the NCP system and promoting the Guidelines in their own activities.
The Decision on the Guidelines recognises the Business and Industry Advisory Committee
(BIAC), the Trade Union Advisory Committee (TUAC) and OECD Watch, as international
partners in the effective implementation of the MNE Guidelines. These three institutional
stakeholders are the primary interlocutors on stakeholder engagement and the first set of
stakeholders the OECD turns to when it comes to stakeholder engagement.
Box 4.1. Institutional stakeholders on RBC

Business at OECD (BIAC) represents the major national business and employers’
organizations from OECD member countries, and through them over 7 million companies.
BIAC also has observer organizations in a number of non-member countries, as well as
over 40 international sector organizations.
The Trade Union Advisory Committee (TUAC) is the interface for trade unions with the
OECD and its members. TUAC has 59 affiliated trade union centres in OECD countries,
representing more than 58 million workers in 2018.
OECD Watch is a global network of civil society organisations with more than 130
members in over 50 countries. OECD Watch’s key aim is to inform and advise the global
NGO community on how to use the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and
its associated grievance mechanism to achieve corporate accountability and access to
remedy for individuals harmed by corporate misconduct.
The world of RBC stakeholders is large, diverse and growing. This ecosystem includes
groups engaged in promoting and implementing RBC standards (such as industry
associations, certification programmes, auditors, as well as technology providers), to those
monitoring non-compliance with the Guidelines (such as NGOs, trade unions, investigative
reporters, and lawyers), to those responsible for implementing responsible business
conduct standards in their operations and global supply chains (such as business both large
and small, and investors). These groups are all part of the growing and diverse universe of
stakeholders with whom the OECD engages with on a regular basis.

-----------------------Page 83 End-----------------------

82  4. STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT
Through engagement with each of these stakeholder groups, the OECD brings relevant and
cutting-edge perspectives, rooted in real-world experience, to advising governments on
RBC issues and in developing standards and tools to promote RBC globally. Stakeholders’
perspectives feed into OECD research and analysis on RBC to inform future work and raise
potential discussion topics at OECD committee level. Stakeholders have a deep knowledge
on the variety of RBC issues and themes both at the process level (experience in supply
chain management and due diligence, conducting audits and corrective action plans) as
well as at the issues level (on for specific risks such as child labour, land tenure, or gender).
The OECD in engaging with stakeholders, leverages the extended networks of stakeholders
both locally and internationally, to ensure that OECD standards, approaches and tools once
developed are widely disseminated and implemented.

4.1. Types of engagement with stakeholders
Standards development: One of the most significant and direct forms of stakeholder
engagement at the OECD is in the development of standards on RBC. In addition to the
Guidelines, since 2010, the OECD has developed five due diligence guidance instruments
on RBC, which have included significant and extensive consultation with stakeholders
from business, trade unions, civil society, international organisations and other experts.1
Their involvement is foreseen in the Principles for the Proactive Agenda, which highlight
that the WPRBC “may create Multi-stakeholder Advisory / Consultative Groups to
facilitate collaboration with advisory bodies (BIAC, TUAC), OECD Watch, international
partners, business, and other affected stakeholders on specific projects, especially projects
on responsible supply chain management under the proactive agenda”.2 As a result, the
OECD due diligence guidance instruments are developed through a multi-stakeholder
process that typically takes up to two years to complete. The process of engaging with
stakeholders in the development of RBC standards benefits from numerous iterations and
revisions, and takes into consideration feedback from business, trade unions, civil society,
governments and other experts received during public consultations, as well as dedicated
multi-stakeholder advisory groups. Stakeholders insights on supply chain characteristics
and complexities, the risks and negative impacts prevalent in specific sectors and business
models, and obstacles to addressing these risks, have helped shape the discussion for what
is do-able and achievable in developing high quality RBC standards. This engagement with
a diverse and atypical group of collaborators gives OECD recommendations on RBC an
unsurpassed level of credibility and buy-in to promote effective uptake and implementation
by business. A list of non-government stakeholders who are part of the various Advisory
Groups is provided in Annex IV.

These standards have been supported through the adoption by the Council of Recommendations
relating to all the five Due Diligence Guidance instruments that have been transposed into OECD
Council Recommendations: The Recommendation of the Council on OECD Due Diligence
Guidance for Responsible Business Conduct, the Recommendation of the Council on Due Diligence
Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas
, the Recommendation of the Council on the Due Diligence Guidance for Meaningful Stakeholder
Engagement in the Extractive Sector , the Recommendation of the Council on the OECD-FAO
Guidance for Responsible Agricultural Supply Chains and the Recommendation of the Council on
OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains in the Garment and Footwear Sector
[C(2017)63].

4. STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT 

Promotion and implementation: Stakeholders continue to play an active role in the
implementation of OECD instruments once they are adopted. The OECD supports
continued stakeholder engagement though the sector related implementation programmes.
A good example of this is the OECD’s Responsible Minerals Programme which has been
on-going since 2011. This programme today counts over 400 stakeholders from business,
civil society, unions, and governments, who are active participants in all aspects of the
programme, from outreach, to promotion of the minerals guidance to the annual
Responsible Minerals Forum. Stakeholders are also engaged in the governance of the
OECD implementation programmes as members of implementation programme Advisory
Groups. In this role, stakeholders continue to shape the areas of work of the programme
including for example geographic areas to focus on, recruitment of key actors in the supply
chain, new analysis and tool development. For example, the OECD with the support of
stakeholders, conducted an assessment of minerals related industry certification schemes
to the OECD Minerals Guidance. In 2018, the OECD launched a similar alignment
assessment in the garment and footwear sector.
Involvement in the National Contact Points system: Stakeholder confidence in the NCP
system is a key to its success and stakeholders play an important role in many, if not all,
aspects of the NCP system. Historically, trade unions and non-governmental organisations
have been the largest submitters of NCP cases (see graph). Stakeholders may also be
formally integrated into the institutional arrangements of the NCP, for example as members
of the NCP or present on advisory or oversight bodies. Business, trade unions and civil
society have also been recipients of NCP’s promotional activities. At the same time, BIAC,
TUAC and OECD Watch have also joined efforts to improve the functioning of NCPs.3

84  4. STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT
Staying connected on RBC issues: Stakeholders are an integral part of the OECD’s ability
to keep abreast of and keep track of the emerging issues in RBC. This real-time access to
information from stakeholders through daily engagement and outreach is vital to the
OECD’s ability to understanding contexts, new and emerging issues which in turn help
shape policy which can address these issues in a balanced and thoughtful way. The OECD
also engages with stakeholders on emerging and new challenges via the annual Global
Forum on RBC, now in its sixth year. In addition, through the sector related implementation
programmes additional conferences and roundtables such as the Responsible Minerals
Forum, the Responsible Garment & Footwear Forum, and the Roundtable on Responsible
Agriculture Supply Chains bring together relevant stakeholders active in each of those
sectors. In addition, the WPRBC, as well as the Investment Committee, hold regular
consultation sessions with the three institutional stakeholders (BIAC, TUAC and OECD
Watch) to hear their views on matters covered by the Guidelines. Institutional stakeholders
are systematically invited to express their views on the WPRBC documents and have in
addition to the regular consultation session this year been invited to participate in selected
sessions of the WPRBC facilitating further engagement and interaction with Adherents on
the implementation of the Guidelines. At the country level, stakeholders are also
systematically consulted in the context of the RBC Chapters of the Investment Policy
Reviews, Adherence and Accession reviews, as well as part of the programme activities in
Asia and Latin America.

4.2. OECD stakeholders – a wide and diverse group
4.2.1. Working with business
Part of the OECD’s mandate on RBC is to help businesses meet the evolving expectations
of RBC. Since the launch of the “pro-active” agenda in 2011, the OECD, together with
BIAC, has taken significant steps to engage with leading businesses and multinational
enterprises to promote understanding and uptake of RBC recommendations globally. This
approach has been particularly notable in the sector guidance implementation programmes
(see Chapter 2 on Sector Activities for further detail), where the OECD works with a wide
network of business practitioners and implementers of supply chain due diligence. The
network of businesses directly engaged with the OECD pilots and projects includes
hundreds of brands and companies, including MNEs and SMEs, in the retail, garment and
footwear, agri-business, food and beverage, electronics, jewellery and financial sector.
Engagement with business from different geographic markets – including business
domiciled in non-Adherent countries such as China and India – is both an opportunity to
promote OECD standards globally, but also provides feedback to the OECD on the
challenges of implementing RBC globally. Working and engaging directly with business
also provides policy makers with the opportunity to hear directly from business on what
works and what remains a challenge in meeting international expectations on RBC. For
example, the OECD organised together with the Thai Ministry of Justice and Joint Standing
Committee on Commerce Industry and Banking (JSCCIB), the main Thai business
association, a conference for business on “Strengthening responsible business conduct
through international standards” which was the first instance where the 2018 OECD Due
Diligence Guidance for Responsible Business Conduct was presented outside of Paris.
Investors are important allies in promoting RBC standards. In recent years, investors, who
are transversal actors across all business sectors, have become more vocal in demanding
credible data on steps investees are taking to address negative environmental impacts,
human rights risks, modern slavery and climate change. This demand comes from socially

-----------------------Page 86 End-----------------------

4. STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT 

responsible investors as well as more traditionally minded investors, such as pension funds,
who are committed to addressing the most serious RBC challenges in the world today. The
OECD has capitalized on this development, by directly engaging with key players and
including their perspectives in informal Advisory Groups and OECD-led promotional
activities on RBC in all the OECD sector work.
Industry associations and industry-led certification schemes are another stakeholder group
which can have a significant and multiplier effect on promoting RBC standards globally.
Industry associations bring together the large and small business who collectively can have
a powerful voice to influence businesses at a sector level in specific geographies or
globally. Industry association engagement with the OECD helps signal that OECD
standards matter, and that the OECD is one of the leading international organisations in the
field of RBC. The OECD through its sector implementation programmes in minerals,
agricultural, garment and footwear, and finance, works with many of the most well-known
industry initiatives and certification programmes globally. These groups include sector or
commodity specific groups such as the RoundTable on Responsible Soy (RTRS) and the
Better Cotton Initiative, with members from critical parts of the supply chain, such as
traders.
Auditors and evaluators are an additional influential group in assessing how companies are
implementing the OECD standards, and as such are an important group with which the
OECD engages. Similarly, lawyers who advise their clients on risk management strategies
and expectations on Responsible Business Conduct from both a regulatory and voluntary
perspective are a group with whom the OECD is beginning to work closely with. While the
OECD has started to develop relationships with these groups, this remains an area of
stakeholder engagement which needs to be further nurtured to gain traction.

4.2.2. Working with trade unions
OECD engagement with workers’ organisations on RBC is primarily channelled through
TUAC, working with its 58 affiliates and trade union partners, representing more than 58
million workers in 2018. In addition, through the sector implementation programmes the
OECD has built relationships with the global unions most active in that sector. Global
unions have played an important role in promoting global framework agreements to address
problems on union engagement across global supply chains. In this context, OECD work
in the garment and footwear sector for example has engaged with IndustriALL Global
Union and its national affiliates promoting the role of trade unions in the due diligence
process, including in identification of harm, prevention and mitigation, monitoring, and
providing access to remedy. OECD work has also engaged with smaller less well-known
worker groups, in developing countries, for example with artisanal mining cooperatives in
the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

4.2.3. Working with civil society
In addition to a close working relationship with OECD Watch, the OECD also cultivates
direct relationships with a wide range of international and local civil society immersed in
RBC issues. These includes CSOs engaged on supply chain transparency issues, land
rights, human rights violations, child labour and the environment to name a few. The sector
implementation programmes in the OECD are a unique means to engage meaningfully with
civil society. CSOs are an integral part of the overall governance structure of the
implementation programme. Most Advisory Groups are led by a chair from one of the
Adherent countries, and have co-chairs drawn from each of the stakeholder groups,

-----------------------Page 87 End-----------------------

86  4. STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT
including civil society. CSOs as members of the AG are thus able to shape the topics of
discussion and set the agenda. Through OECD engagement with CSOs working on the
ground, often in high-risk environments, the OECD is able to gather candid feedback on
RBC recommendations, approaches and the impact of these recommendations on in
practice. This helps increase the effectiveness and credibility of OECD recommendations
and work in RBC.

4.2.4. Working with researchers, academics and experts
The themes and issues pertaining to RBC are multiple and deep. Recognising this, the
OECD engages with many technical experts outside the OECD working in the specifics of
RBC to ensure that OECD standards and approaches are integrated into cutting-edge
research and approaches to promote responsible business. By engaging with academia and
researchers, the OECD is informed on the latest trends and research, and is able to further
support business and policy makers through analysis and expertise. Many leading research
institutions and universities participate in the OECD informal Advisory Groups.
In conclusion, meaningful stakeholder engagement is a key feature of the implementation
of the Guidelines and applies to all pillars of the OECD’s work on RBC: the functioning of
NCPs, supply chain due diligence and government policies for RBC. In light of economic
changes and the advancement of the responsibility of business towards society, the concept
of RBC has evolved to include a larger and increasingly broad scope of stakeholders in its
practical implementation. Recent examples include increased engagement by investors, but
also evaluators and auditors. At the same time, the OECD is continuously expanding its
base of stakeholder engagement as the RBC work touches on new sectors and countries as
part of the programmes in Asia and Latin America.

Box 4.2. Statement by BIAC

Today, many companies have integrated responsible business conduct considerations into
their overall business strategy to manage their activities in a responsible way. We consider
responsible business conduct as promoted by the OECD Guidelines for Multinational
Enterprises (MNE Guidelines) to be an essential part of an open investment climate and in
the best interest of business. To that end, we are working in partnership with the OECD,
national governments and our members to support an effective implementation of the MNE
Guidelines, ensure a shared understanding of the NCP process and promote them in
adhering countries and beyond to support a global level playing field.
We are working closely with our member and observer organizations and multinational
enterprises, both large and small, to raise the visibility of the MNE Guidelines by
participating in events and raising awareness in regular online communications. Our
business brochure on the MNE Guidelines has been widely distributed to provide our
members with a user-friendly communication tool that helps multinational enterprises
understand what they need to know about the Guidelines and why this unique governmentbacked responsible business conduct instrument is of major importance for business.
A key focus in 2018 was our contribution to the development of the OECD general due
diligence guidance for responsible business conduct to ensure that the guidance reflects
both business opportunities and challenges in this context. The Guidance should provide
businesses looking for information about the Guidelines with an accessible text and present

to them practical proposals about how they could set up their due diligence, while
recognizing that due diligence needs to be adapted to specific situations. We contributed
to several outreach events regarding the OECD Guidelines and related activities in 2018,
including meetings on the Due Diligence Guidance in Switzerland and France among
others and a meeting hosted by our Japanese member on responsible supply chains in Asia.
Our national member organizations were in active contact with their respective NCPs
throughout the year.
We also maintained a strong presence at the annual OECD Global Forum on Responsible
Business Conduct and have remained an active partner in the proactive agenda project to
ensure that the concrete experience of different sectors, including finance, textiles, as well
as food and agriculture, is duly reflected. A great number of our members participated in
the OECD forum on responsible mineral supply chains and the forum on due diligence in
the garment and footwear sector.

Box 4.3. Statement by TUAC

In 2018, the Trade Union Advisory Committee to the OECD (TUAC), working together
with its affiliates and trade union partners, undertook activities aimed at building trade
union capacity on the OECD Guidelines and strengthening the NCPs. TUAC called for the
OECD to publish a list of non-functioning NCPs as a response to the failure of some
governments to meet their binding obligations to create effective NCPs. TUAC was also
involved in developing the general due diligence guidance and efforts to promote its
implementation.
TUAC participated in the peer reviews of Canada and the UK, together with the Canadian
Labor Congress (CLC) and Trades Union Congress (TUC). Both NCPs have experienced
a significant decline in stakeholder confidence, which is particularly striking for the UK,
previously a high-performing NCP. It is essential that the peer review process drive the
change necessary to re-build the trust of stakeholders. TUAC provided input on Croatia’s
proposed NCP, as part of the adherence review of the Investment Committee (IC). Further
to Kazakhstan’s adherence to the Investment Declaration and the IC’s commitment to
monitor its progress on human rights, including labour rights, TUAC and the International
Trade Union Confederation (ITUC) continued to highlight ongoing repression of trade
union rights.
TUAC, the ITUC, UNI Global Union, the AFL-CIO and the Korean Metal Workers' Union
were members of the Advisory Group for the development of the general due diligence
guidance. TUAC submitted a ‘Five-point Plan’ to the 2018 MCM that, inter alia, called for
governments to introduce legislation making due diligence mandatory and to provide
capacity building on due diligence for trade unionists4. Trade unions were strongly
represented at the 2018 Garment and Footwear Sector Forum, including in a panel on
worker engagement and due diligence, and the OECD worked with the Global Union
IndustriALL on activities to implement the due diligence guidance for the garment and
footwear sector.

TUAC provided training on the OECD Guidelines and due diligence guidance to trade
unionists around the world. Together with Friedrich Ebert Stiftung (FES), it organised two
workshops in Jordan and Tunisia for trade unionists from the Mashrek and Maghreb. The
Jordanian NCP failed to attend the workshop in Amman. Three representatives of the
Tunisian Government, including the new NCP, and a representative of the Moroccan NCP
attended the event in Tunis. A key objective was to “train trainers” so as to build capacity
within the regions. Other training events were held in: Ottawa, Canada, Canadian trade
unions (CLC); Sol, Indonesia, Indonesian trade unions from garments and footwear
(IndustriALL-TUAC); Riga, Latvia, meeting of Baltic and Nordic trade unions (NFS);
Paris, Trade Union Strategy Meeting on Due Diligence (TUAC); Geneva, UN Global
Forum on Business and Human Rights, Panel on Due Diligence and Freedom of
Association (ITUC); Copenhagen, Briefing on the OECD due diligence guidance (ITUC
Congress).
Throughout 2018, TUAC supported trade unions in filing cases under the OECD
Guidelines. It undertook a fact-finding mission to Brazil and Panama in support of a BWIIndustriALL case concerning the involvement of Vale and BHP Billiton in the collapse of
the Fundão Dam, and a potential case in Panama concerning violations of the rights of
migrant workers. TUAC maintained its database on trade unions cases*, and continued to
disseminate its Trade Union Guide to the Guidelines, which is currently available in 14
languages. **

Box 4.4. Statement by OECD Watch

In 2018, civil society confidence in NCPs and the Guidelines is declining. Now when
multilateralism is under threat globally, OECD member states must ensure the Guidelines
and NCP grievance mechanism stand as effective tools to promote responsible business
conduct and facilitate access to remedy. Yet in the experience of civil society, remedy via
specific instances remains rare. Further, many NCPs continue to operate with structures
and procedures that are not transparent or predictable and that do not ensure impartiality
between parties and accountability for harms. OECD Watch’s June briefing on the State of
Remedy under the OECD Guidelines found that just a quarter of specific instances
concluded in 2017 achieved some meaningful remedy for complainants, with just one
resulting in compensation of victims. Meanwhile, other cases have been mishandled in
ways that actively discourage stakeholder confidence. A particular low point in 2018 was
the Canadian NCP’s unpredictable, unilateral re-issuance of a one-sided final statement in
the case BMF v. Sakto Group. The Canadian NCP’s actions cast doubt on the NCP’s
impartiality and jeopardize faith in the integrity of the whole NCP system.
During 2018, OECD Watch engaged closely in the Investment Committee’s review of our
first-ever substantiated submission over the Australian NCP’s mishandling of a case. We
appreciate the timeliness and rigor of the review, but remain deeply concerned with the
Committee’s response, which missed critical opportunities to clarify how NCPs should
interpret the admissibility criteria, handle information shared with only one party,

distinguish the state duty from the corporate responsibility to protect human rights, and
manage cases subject to parallel proceedings. The review process also did not allow OECD
Watch equitable access to information. We welcome the WPRBC’s proposal to revise the
process in 2019, and we seek for more of our recommendations to be incorporated into a
new model.
In 2018 OECD Watch also repeatedly raised concerns over serious shortcomings in the
NCP peer review process. For a decade, OECD Watch members have engaged in the peer
reviews, and by 2018 we feel our efforts have not paid off. NCPs remain far from achieving
functional equivalence, yet the peer reviewers still do not offer meaningful criticism of
poor NCP structures and practices, nor prompt NCPs to implement tangible reforms to
facilitate remedy. Civil society feels its input, if made public at all, is largely not reflected
in peers’ analyses, and that the handling of cases does not improve at reviewed NCPs. This
reality discourages civil society from engaging in future reviews. Nevertheless, we
appreciate the WPRBC’s commitment to revising the process and template, and we look
forward to working together toward reform in 2019. We also seek more impactful peer
reviews of NCPs starting in 2019.
Despite the serious concerns raised above, 2018 has seen several bright spots. The May
release of the Due Diligence Guidance was a high point. The OECD’s process to develop
the Guidance reflected meaningful involvement of all three stakeholder groups, and OECD
Watch looks to see more of this in future policy initiatives. Another high point in
stakeholder engagement was a workshop OECD Watch held in May for global NGOs and
NCPs from eight countries. The two-day workshop was carried out through a Dutch
government-funded project focused on capacity building and engagement with Central
Eastern European NGOs and NCPs, and was co-financed by the Norwegian and Danish
NCPs. The workshop enabled in-depth, frank discussion between NGOs and NCPs about
the specific instance process. In 2019, OECD Watch urges member states to pursue more
workshops in other regions based upon this model, which can increase mutual
understanding and learning between NCPs and complainants. Finally, OECD Watch
enjoyed collaboration with global NGOs and unions in advancing the first-ever specific
instance on tax avoidance in the case of FNV v. Chevron’s Dutch subsidiaries, filed at the
Netherlands NCP. We look forward in 2019 to further engagement with the OECD and
other stakeholders through this case as well as the sectoral due diligence projects, to set
new global standards for corporate responsibility.

Annex B. NCP peer review reports: Key findings and recommendations

Peer review of the National Contact Point of Germany1
Institutional Arrangements
Findings

Recommendations

1.1

The German NAP states that “the NCP will
become the central complaints mechanism for
foreign trade and investment promotion projects.
(…) The aim is to ensure that enterprises which
avail themselves of foreign-trade promotion
instruments exercise due diligence. In particular,
this includes participation in grievance
proceedings initiated against them before the
German NCP.” The NCP and the Interministerial
Steering Group have not yet clarified the scope
and functioning of this new measure.

The NCP should, together with the Inter-Ministerial
Steering Group and potentially the Working Group
and its wider stakeholders, clarify the scope and
functioning of this measure with respect to foreign
trade and investment promotion projects and
communicate it in order to ensure clarity.

1.2

There has been frequent staff turnover in the NCP
and it is anticipated that there will continue to be
regular staff rotations in the future due to the
structure of the ministry itself.

The NCP should create a handover process and
record institutional memory to preserve good
practices. This could include internal written
procedures to guide the work of the NCP, in order to
maintain the recent progress made in the functioning
of the NCP

1.3

Some representatives of the Working Group and
some external stakeholders noted a lack of clarity
about the roles and responsibilities of the
Interministerial Steering Group and the Working
Group

The NCP should discuss with the Inter-Ministerial
Steering Group and Working Group the respective
roles and responsibilities and then clearly define and
communicate those roles and responsibilities,
internally and externally, in order to ensure that
stakeholders understand both, especially in relation
to the handling of specific instances

Promotional activities
Findings

Recommendations

2.1

The NCP focuses on engaging with industry and
trade union associations and NGO coalitions,
particularly those that are part of its Working
Group, because most of these groups have
existing relationships with key stakeholder groups
and are the most actively engaged with the NCP.

As the NCP expands its promotional strategy and
strengthens its existing relationships with groups, it
should also give increased focus to diversifying and
building relationships directly with companies and
trade unions, particularly to highlight the recent
changes to the NCP.

2.2

Stakeholders including business, noted that
awareness of the Guidelines and the NCP is
generally low in non-adhering countries where
German companies operate.

As the NCP expands its promotional strategy and
continues its engagement with embassy officers, it
should give particular consideration to providing
trainings on RBC for officers in non-adhering
countries where German companies operate.

Specific instances
3

Findings

Recommendations

3.1

The Procedural Notes contain several provisions
on confidentiality which use different
terminology. Several civil society stakeholders
noted that the provisions on confidentiality and
campaigning were seen as a deterrent to some
potential submitters

The NCP should consider updating its Procedural
Notes to make certain provisions clearer. In particular,
the NCP should clarify and consolidate the provisions
on confidentiality. Recognising that the provisions on
campaigning and confidentiality may be acting as a
deterrent to submitting specific instances, the NCP
should consider discussing these provisions with
stakeholders, ensuring that the provisions are
equitable and ensure transparency wherever possible

3.2

Some of the older final statements do not clearly
describe the reasoning for the NCP’s decision or
outcomes achieved through the process. This
contrasts to the most recent statements which
are more comprehensive.

The NCP should continue to publish clear and
meaningful final statements and may consider
developing a clear template for final statements to
ensure quality and consistency

 95

Peer review of the National Contact Point of Chile 2
Institutional Arrangements
Findings

Recommendations

1.1

Currently there are no staff members which
devote the entirety or majority of their time to NCP
activities. Several stakeholders and members of
the government noted that having the same
official responsible for NCP activities as well
promotion of international trade and investment
can create confusion amongst stakeholders.

The NCP should be made into a distinct unit
which is devoted to NCP activities and should be
provided with sufficient resources. Specifically, it
should have at least one full-time staff member
engaged in NCP activities.

1.2

There has been frequent turnover of staff at the
NCP which has adversely impacted the effective
functioning of the NCP.

The NCP should develop systems to facilitate staff
transitions such as: a formal system of information
management; clarifying and institutionalising
processes such as specific instance handling;
formal training and handover processes for staff
new to the role. In addition, the NCP should
consider possible strategies to retain staff in the
NCP for longer periods than has been the case in
recent years.

1.3

The Government Advisory Committee has not
been active since its initial creation in 2012.

The NCP should consider the most effective and
strategic way to engage across government in
carrying out its mandate. Should the NCP change
its initial structure, it may wish to rethink the role of
the Government Advisory Committee.

1.4

There is no clear mandate for the Civil Society
Committee

The NCP should consider strategically how best to
engage effectively with external stakeholders. As
part of this work, it might consult the Civil Society
Committee to define its mandate, taking into
account the needs of the NCP as well as the
capacity and interest of members to contribute.

Promotional activities

2.1

Findings

Recommendations

The NCP is lacking in visibility within the
government and externally.

In order to improve promotional activities, the NCP is
encouraged to develop a strategic promotional plan to
target particular sectors or stakeholder groups. The
NCP should also consider allocating more resources,
including staff time, to promotional activities, but
equally, the plan should consider promotional
activities which can be carried out without significant
resources and in cooperation with civils society,
academia, labour unions and business associations.

96  ANNEX B.

Specific instances
Findings

Recommendations

3.1

The rules of procedure are relatively short
and do not provide detailed information on
important aspects of the proceedings.

In order to improve predictability in the handling
of specific instances the NCP should develop
complete and consistent rules of procedure as
set out in the Procedural Guidance of the OECD
Guidelines. In particular, the rules of procedure
should provide guidance on initial assessment,
confidentiality and transparency issues, how
information is shared amongst the parties and
publically and indicative timelines.

3.2

In situations where mediation has been refused
the NCP has promptly closed the proceeding
without undertaking further analysis of the
issues.

In order to make best use of the specific instance
process, where a company chooses not to engage
in mediation, the NCP should make efforts to
develop final statements which are as meaningful as
possible. This could involve an independent analysis
of the issues raised in the submission and relevant
recommendations.

 97

Peer review of the National Contact Point of the United States
Institutional arrangements3
Findings

Recommendations

1.1

For many years prior to the 2011 update to
the Guidelines, the NCP was not active or
visible but that there have been significant
improvements in its functioning in recent
years, particularly since assigning a senior
full-time official to the role.

In order to maintain the positive gains made by
the NCP, the U.S. should ensure that the NCP
continues to be staffed by at least one full-time
senior staff member and supported by at least
two full-time, permanent, staff members. Given
the size of the U.S. and the global economic
presence of U.S. MNEs, an even larger team
would be appropriate and should be considered.

1.2

Some members of the IWG noted that they
could be more proactive in promotion with
respect to the NCP throughout their own
networks.

The IWG members should take more ownership
with respect to promotion of the Guidelines and
raising awareness of the NCP mechanism and IWG
members should act as “ambassadors” for the
Guidelines within their own departments and
beyond.

1.3

Several civil society and labour members of the
SAB expressed the perception that the new
structure of the SAB changed its role and the
nature of dialogue at SAB meetings

With a view to retaining the confidence of its civil
society and labour stakeholders the NCP should
ensure members increased input and ownership in
the direction and meetings of the SAB.

Promotional activities

2.1

Findings

Recommendations

Many stakeholders noted that increased
outreach to potential users of the specific
instance mechanism (such as NGOs, local
communities) is important.

The NCP should focus more attention on
awareness raising of the Guidelines and the
NCP mechanism with civil society. In this
respect, specific promotional events could be
planned with civil society groups, particularly
NGOs, to explain the potential benefits of the
specific instance mechanism. The SAB and IWG
could be instrumental in these outreach efforts.

98  ANNEX B.

Specific instances
Findings

Recommendations

3.1

Some parties to specific instances noted that
mediators did not have a strong grasp of the
recommendations of the Guidelines,
particularly international labour and human
rights standards.

In order to promote strong outcomes from
mediation the NCP should ensure that the
Guidelines are the standard used as a reference
in mediation discussions and that mediators are
knowledgeable about the Guidelines.

3.2

In practice, encouraging companies to
participate in the mediation process has been
a challenge. The NCP has made efforts
respond to this challenge through engaging
in outreach to the business community to
demystify the process, as well as more
robust engagement procedures during the
Initial Assessment and pre-mediation phases.

The NCP should consider additional efforts to
encourage companies to participate in mediation
and set up a process to better understand why
companies are hesitate to engage and how they
can be encouraged to.

3.3

Provisions on confidentiality and
campaigning were seen by some
stakeholders as a deterrent to some potential
submitters of specific instances.

The NCP should ensure that its position around
confidentiality and campaigning is equitable,
meaning the preferences and needs of both
parties should be taken into account, and
promotes transparency to the greatest extent
possible.

 99

Peer review of the National Contact Point of Austria 4
Institutional arrangements
Findings

Recommendations

1.1

The NCP has one dedicated full-time
midcareer staff member. Many stakeholders
participating in the peer review noted that
having only one person responsible for all the
activities and decisions of the NCP was not
sufficient with respect to human resources.

Necessary human and financial resources should
be made available to the NCP.

1.2

Some stakeholders noted that they did not
always perceive the NCP to be impartial.

The NCP should take steps to correct this
perception and organise and structure itself with the
aim of gaining the confidence of a broader group of
stakeholders.

1.3

The current voting procedures of the Steering
Committee do not lend to an ideally balanced
representation of stakeholders.

The NCP should create the conditions for the
perspectives of all stakeholders to be appropriately
and equitably reflected with respect to the Steering
Committee.

1.4

The majority of members of the Steering
Committee saw their role as primarily advisory,
especially with respect to specific instances.

The NCP should ensure the Steering Committee is
characterized mainly as a consultative body vis-àvis activities of the NCP.

Promotional activities
Findings

Recommendations

2.1

Traditionally promotional activities of the NCP
targeted primarily the business community.
However, increasingly the NCP is engaging
with a broader range of stakeholders.

The NCP should continue and strengthen the
dialogue with civil society to discuss
collaboration on promotion and targeting
promotional activities towards NGOs, in addition
to worker organisations to improve the
perception of the mechanism and promote
engagement in the specific instance process.

2.2

At present the Steering Committee is the only
interagency or multi-stakeholder body in
Austria that exists to discuss RBC. As a
consequence, at meetings of the Steering
Committee different issues relating to RBC
which sometimes go beyond the remit of the
body, are raised.

The NCP may explore the possibility of
organising or participating in the organisation of
a forum where stakeholders and relevant
members of government can exchange on RBC.

Specific instances
Findings

Recommendations

3.1

The specific instance procedure is described
in the NCP Terms of Reference as well as in
a Guidance document developed for
promotional purposes. The NCP has noted it
plans to update this Guidance subsequent to
the peer review. Additionally some specific
provisions of the Terms of Reference are not
fully clear.

When undertaking the update of the Guidance
the NCP should clarify its relationship to the
NCP Terms of Reference and ensure that both
documents are in line with each other. It should
also revise a few specific provisions in their
Terms of Reference to provide clarity on
appointment of external mediators, costs related
to specific instance proceedings, the NCP’s
position on confidentiality and campaigning, and
the fact that the NCP is able to consider issues
raised with respect to the conduct of companies
operating in or from Austria.

3.2

The specific instance process could be
supported by more technical expertise and
by involving independent mediators.

The NCP should engage technical experts in the
specific instance process as needed and by
following up on their intention to engage external
mediators more systematically.

 101

Peer review of the National Contact Point of Canada5
Institutional arrangements
Findings

Recommendations

1.1

Stakeholders did not seem sufficiently aware
of the active role of NCP members drawn
from other departments (outside of the Trade
Commissioner Service) in the activities and
decision making of the NCP.

The NCP should explore additional ways to
ensure that the role of NCP members is
understood by parties to specific instances and
the broader public. For example, mentioning the
involvement of relevant NCP members in final
statements of specific instances or publicising
the structure of the NCP and the role of its
members within the NCP Procedures Guide for
specific instances may be ways of achieving this.

1.2

A lack of formal involvement of social partners
and external stakeholders in the NCP’s
governance arrangements contributes to the
perception of lack impartiality with respect to the
NCP.

The NCP should consult with its social partners and
other stakeholders in connection to creating a new
Advisory Body for the NCP to ensure that it is
representative and effective in mitigating
perceptions of a lack of impartiality. If the advisory
members are drawn from another body, the NCP
should ensure that they have a clear and
appropriate mandate with respect to their role visavis the NCP.

1.3

A challenge noted by the NCP is to balance the
number and unpredictable nature of specific
instances with the need for planned resource
commitments for the promotion of the NCP and
the Guidelines, and other activities.

Considering the global economic presence of
Canadian MNEs and in order to respond to an
increasing case load, a larger NCP team would be
appropriate and should be considered.

1.4

There are no formal reporting requirements
within the government on the activities of the
NCP.

The NCP should use its annual report to promote its
work and activities across the federal and provincial
governments and the parliament. This would help to
demonstrate accountability and support requests for
additional budget or staff.

1.5

The mandate of the Ombudsperson overlaps
somewhat with that of the NCP, as a result the
Ombudsperson may represent a competing
venue for grievances on business and human
rights.

In establishing the Ombudsperson office, steps
should be taken to ensure potential synergies with
the NCP are identified and potential duplication with
the NCP mandate is mitigated. Institutional
arrangements for the two bodies should be
coordinated.

Promotional activities
Findings

Recommendations

2.1

Many stakeholders noted support for the mechanism
by which trade advocacy and financial support can be
withheld if companies do not engage in good faith and
constructively with the NCP (i.e. the ‘sanction’) but
demonstrated a lack understanding of it and called for
more transparency with respect to its applicability.

The NCP should promote the
mechanism and clearly communicate
on its scope and application with
stakeholders and parties to specific
instances.

2.2

Civil society organisations, and NGOs in particular, do
not seem very aware of the potential benefits of using
the NCP’s procedure for specific instances.

The NCP is encouraged to continue its
work with NGOs with a view to
establishing a regular dialogue so as
to improve their confidence in the
NCP’s specific instance mechanism.

Specific instances
Findings

Recommendations

3.1

Some stakeholders participating in the
peer review noted that the requirements for
substantiation were unclear and that the
NCP's application of the initial assessment
criteria was onerous.

The NCP should offer assistance and work with
submitters to further substantiate their claims or
reformulate submissions where necessary to allow
for them to be accepted for further examination.
Additionally, substantiation requirements and
evidentiary thresholds should be clearly explained
to submitters in the NCP's rules of procedure and
ensure accessibility.

3.2

Several civil society and trade union
stakeholders raised concerns about the
NCP’s campaigning policy and noted that
revising it would be necessary to build trust
and encourage certain stakeholders to
utilise the specific instance mechanism.

The NCP should ensure that its policy on
campaigning is predictable, equitable (meaning the
preferences and needs of both parties should be
taken into account), and promotes transparency to
the greatest extent possible.

3.3

Some submitters of specific instances
noted that language in some initial
assessment by the NCP undermined the
position of the submitter by implying there
was no breach of the Guidelines by the
company or that the claims raised in a
submission were without merit.

The NCP should be clear that a decision not to
accept a specific instance for further examination
during initial assessment should not in principle be
equated with a determination on the merits of the
issues raised in the submission.

3.4

Some stakeholders see the specific
instance process as lacking in
transparency, predictability and
impartiality.

In order to further improve the mechanism and build
trust amongst potential submitters, the NCP should
enhance transparency with respect to the specific
instance process. This may involve publishing initial
assessments, communicating and providing
explanations to parties when timelines cannot be
respected, sharing the information used to make a
decision amongst both parties where possible and
clearly explaining the rationale for deciding whether
to accept (or not accept) specific instances for
further examination in statements.

Annex C. Substantiated submission by OECD Watch:
Key findings and recommendations

In November 2017, OECD Watch made the first substantiated submission under the
Procedural Guidance of the Guidelines. This process notes that the Investment Committee
will consider a substantiated submission on whether an NCP is fulfilling its responsibilities
with regard to its handling of specific instances. The below summary of key findings and
recommendations is taken from the final response by the Investment Committee to the
substantiated submission.
The Investment Committee finds that in the handling of the specific instance:
1. In certain respects, the Australian NCP (ANCP) did not act transparently or predictably with
respect to indicative timelines and in not following its review process procedures; and
2. Certain actions of the ANCP contributed towards a perception of a lack of impartiality and
accessibility.
To promote transparency and predictability the Investment Committee recommends that:
a) The ANCP communicate and explain reasons for delays to parties to a specific instance, when
they occur.
b) The ANCP, if choosing to have a review procedure, respect its own published rules of
procedures for such a process. Where the ANCP departs from its rules of procedure, the ANCP
should communicate with parties and explain the reason for the departure.
To build trust with parties and avoid perceptions of lack of impartiality and accessibility Investment
Committee recommends that:
a) when information is withheld from one party and/or when withheld information is used as the
basis of a decision of the ANCP, the ANCP should notify the relevant party and explain why the
information was withheld (i.e. why it is sensitive). It also recommends sharing information
between the parties to the extent possible, for example through redacting, summarising, or
anonymising sensitive information as necessary.
b) where relevant, the ANCP should strive to clearly articulate how it distinguishes issues of
corporate responsibility from issues of state duty in its public statement(s).
c) whenever the ANCP decides that accepting a specific instance would not further the
Guidelines and/or could cause serious prejudice to ongoing proceedings, the ANCP should strive
to clearly articulate the reasons for such a position in its public statement(s).
d) the ANCP should ensure that if conclusions of fact are made in a specific instance statement,
they should be based (and appear to be based) on more than the assertions of one party.

The Guidance was approved by the OECD Working Party on Responsible Business Conduct on 6
March 2018 and the Investment Committee on 3 April 2018.
