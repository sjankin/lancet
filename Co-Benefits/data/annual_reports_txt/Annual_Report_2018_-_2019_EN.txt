1 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
This Report presents progress made by the SADC Secretariat in collaboration with Member
States and other stakeholders in implementing the SADC regional cooperation and integration
programmes during the 2018/19 fiscal year, guided by the Revised Regional Indicative Strategic
Development Plan (RISDP) and Strategic Indicative Plan for the Organ (SIPO).
The economic performance of the SADC region in 2018 improved slightly when compared to
2017, despite the weak global economic conditions, and adverse weather conditions that affected
some parts of the region. The Region’s economic growth in 2018 is estimated at 3.1% compared
to 2.9% recorded in 2017, while the Global economic performance declined from 3.8% in 2017 to
3.6% in 2018. Equally, per capita GDP for the region improved from US$ 4,004 in 2017 to
US$4,171 in 2018, as inflation rate also declined from 9.8% in 2017 to 8.1% in 2018.
In the implementation of 2018/19 Corporate plan, overall implementation stood at 80%. This
improved performance is as a result of measures put in place to improve internal processes,
internal skills development, shift from activity based planning approach to results based planning
and reporting; and coordination and management of projects and programmes, amongst others.
Regarding implementation of the Industrialization Strategy and Roadmap, progress was made in
the development of the draft protocol on industry, which is envisaged to become a stand-alone
legal instrument aiming at promoting the development of diversified, innovative and globally
competitive regional and national industrial bases for sustainable and inclusive industrial
development. The profiling of agro-processing was completed, whereby 14 product-specific value
chains were identified as having the highest impact potential for upgrading and increasing intraregional trade, and integration into global value chains; and as a source of inputs for
manufacturing. Furthermore, the draft regional mining vision and the Action plan was finalised,
which aims at optimizing the sustainable development of mineral resources extraction across the
region.
To facilitate trade, the region adopted the Simplified Trade Regime (STR) Framework and the
Regional Framework for the Electronic Certificate of Origin (E-CoO). Application of the Regional
Framework for the Electronic Certificate of Origin has enabled the traders to apply for the
certificate of origin electronically hence enhancing trade in the region. Efficiency in payment
systems increased through the introduction of Real Time Gross Settlement System (RTGS) in the
region. In addition to that, improved Financial Inclusion has been a key enabler in contributing to
the reduction of poverty and boosting prosperity, attracting more individuals to participate in
financial products and services from an estimated adult population of 60% in 2016 to 68% in 2018.
Furthermore, strengthening regional infrastructure connectivity was prioritised by providing grants
for project preparation and development for cross-border regional infrastructure projects. A total
of US $ 19.6 million was approved by 2018, for the preparation of ten regional projects cove ring
energy, transport and water, which is expected to generate US$ 5.8 billion in infrastructure
investment. Progress has also been made in operationalizing the SADC Regional Development
Fund, and to date nine Member States have signed the Agreement.
Progress was also made towards realization of the SADC Infrastructure Vision 2027, which
contributes towards industrial development and economic growth. This progress includes, among
v

-----------------------Page 6 End-----------------------

others, the installation and commissioning of 4,175 MW of power generation to supplement the
regional energy needs, the ongoing construction of the Kazungula Bridge in the North-South
Corridor to facilitate trade and transport in the region, the construction of the Port of Walvis Bay’s
New Container Terminal in Namibia; and the implementation of the Dar es Salaam-Chalinze Toll
road, which will connect Tanzania with Malawi and DRC. Further progress includes
implementation of the SADC Roaming Project aimed at lowering international mobile roaming
rates and projects to increase access to potable water supply, and enhancing the capability of
Member States to respond to climate-induced disasters in the region.
The Region remained peaceful and stable in 2018/19, and witnessed the holding of democratic
elections and smooth transfer of power in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Zimbabwe;
the Kingdom of Eswatini; the Republic of Madagascar; South Africa; and Malawi. The historical
and peaceful transfer of power in the DRC opened a new chapter in the political sphere for
economic prosperity, peace and political stability.
Considerable progress was also made to stimulate crop production, productivity and
competiveness, as well as to improve market access for crops and their products in the region. A
draft Crop Development Programme and the SADC Guidelines on Seed Certification and Quality
Assurance were developed and validated to increase access to quality seed and overall crop
production. Efforts were also made to minimize the challenges of local and transboundary pests
and diseases affecting food security and livestock production through capacity building and
awareness campaigns including use of surveillance and monitoring equipment. Initiatives were
undertaken to increase forecasting and early warning for food security in the region. To date
fourteen (14) Members States have established National Vulnerability Assessment Committees
to facilitate assessments and analysis. Furthermore, early warning weather and climate
information was generated by the SADC Climate Services Centre, and disseminated continuously
to facilitate preparedness by SADC Member States.
In order to realize social and human development in the region, Member states responded
positively to align their National Qualifications Frameworks to Regional standards, which amongst
others will promote mobility of professionals across the region. In addition, operationalization of
the SADC pooled procurement services has guaranteed the region with reduced prices on
procurement of quality and essential medicines and health commodities. Furthermore, various
initiatives were implemented to reduce HIV/AIDS transmission and eliminate Malaria in the region.
Efforts to engage youth as key drivers of the SADC Industrialization and integration agenda were
enhanced through operationalization of the 38th SADC Summit Theme “Promoting Infrastructure
Development and Youth Empowerment for Sustainable Development”. Key issues pertaining to
youth’s involvement, employment, empowerment and development were considered.
A comprehensive Mid-term review of the Revised RISDP 2015-2020 commenced to inform
implementation of the remaining period, as well as the development of the Post 2020 Agenda.
Furthermore, rolling out of the SADC Online M&E system to seven (7) Member States was
undertaken to facilitate timely reporting on the implementation of SADC programmes. To enhance
continental cooperation and integration and to track implementation progress on the reformed
process, SADC secretariat engaged with the African Union Commission, other RECs and
International Institutions. In all these engagements, SADC concerns regarding the reform process
were addressed and SADC’s position safeguarded.
vi

-----------------------Page 7 End-----------------------

As an initiative to ensure sustainable financing mechanisms for implementation of regional
programmes, the draft SADC Regional Resource Mobilization Framework was finalized. SADC
continues to appreciate the critical role played by Development Partners towards development of
the region. In view of this, several agreements and other legal instruments were concluded with
a number of International Cooperating Partners (ICPs), who continued to extend their support
both technically and/or financially. Support was received from the African Development Bank,
African Union, World Bank, European Union, German Development Bank (KfW) and German
Corporation for International Cooperation (Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale
Zusammenarbeit, GIZ), United States Agency for International Development (USAID), Norway,
Global Fund, Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA), Swiss Agency for
Development and Cooperation (SDC), and China.
In 2019/2020, the Secretariat will continue to engage with Development Partners and prioritize
implementation of key programmes of regional cooperation and integration towards improving the
quality of life for the peoples of Southern Africa.

2 INTRODUCTION
Deepening regional integration in the SADC region remained the central focus in 2018/19
Financial Year. Concerted efforts were made not only to drive the agenda towards implementation
of the medium-term economic and social policies being implemented across the different areas
but to take stock of progress being made towards regional integration. Such efforts were guided
by the Regional Indicative Strategic Development Plan (RISDP), which is a comprehensive
development and implementation framework guiding the integration agenda of SADC over a
period of fifteen years (2005-2020); and the Strategic Indicative Plan for the Organ (SIPO) on
Politics, Defence and Security Cooperation, whose core objective is to create a peaceful and
stable political and security environment through which the Region will realise its objectives of
development and economic growth, peace and security, poverty alleviation and enhance the
standard and quality of life for the peoples of Southern Africa remain the remain the core
comprehensive development frameworks that guide the implementation of SADC’s integration
agenda and realization of the regional body’s Objectives, Vision and Mission as enshrined in the
SADC Treaty and Common Agenda.
This Report presents progress made towards implementation of the SADC regional cooperation
and integration programmes during the 2018/19 fiscal year by the SADC Secretariat in
collaboration with the Member States and other stakeholders. The report outlines the following

2018-19 ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
Global Economic Background

Economic activities
According to the IMF World Economic Outlook report of April 2019, global growth in 2018 receded
to 3.6% from 3.8% in 2017. This may be ascribed to the effects of the decline in commodity prices,
trade policy uncertainty and escalation of trade tensions. Two-thirds of countries, accounting for
about three-quarters of global output, experienced subdued growth in 2018 compared to the
previous year. Advanced countries in Europe and emerging economies in Asia lost momentum
more than expected as consumer demand took a downswing and business confidence weakened
due to the introduction of new emission standards.

Growth in emerging and developing economies in Asia, which accounts for over half of the world
growth retreated to 6.4 in 2018 from 6.5% in 2017. This reflects weak global activity, especially in
the second half of 2018 and the impact of lingering trade tensions with the United States.
Economic growth in China moderated to 6.6% in 2018 from 6.8% in 2017, recording the lowest
rate since 1990. China’s growth declined following a combination of the needed regulatory
tightening to rein in shadow banking and an increase in trade tensions with the United States.
India's growth accelerated to an estimated 7.1% in 2018 from 7.2% recorded in 2017. This was
largely driven by strong domestic demand, increased investment and a rebound of credit growth.
In sub-Saharan Africa, growth picked up from 2.9% in 2017 to 3% in 2018. However, economic
outcomes are far from uniform in Sub-Saharan Africa. Oil exporters are still dealing with the legacy
of the largest real oil price decline since 1970; debt levels are rising in some countries; and other
countries are suffering from internal conflicts.
Developments in Commodity Prices
Commodity prices lost momentum in 2018, with the majority of energy, metal, mineral, and
agricultural commodity prices declining in the last quarter of 2018, only to rebound in the first
quarter of 2019. The Commodity Price Index show a mixed picture for 2018. Overall the index fell
by 10% in 2018. The trends of commodity prices were largely informed by elevated geopolitical
tensions related to Iran, Saudi Arabia and Yemen, a weaker dollar and adverse inflation
expectations that resulted in poor performance in oil and some precious metals in 2018.
Commodity prices were further weighed down by the recently enacted and prospective policy
actions such as U.S. import tariffs on aluminium and steel and U.S. sanctions on Russian
commodity producers also contributed to an increase in metals prices. The Food Price Index,
from January to September decreased by 8.7%, but increased by 4.2% in last quarter of 2018
due to unfavourable weather conditions in some parts of the world.

The World Bank Commodity Prices Index, show that commodity prices were largely driven by
changes in energy and metal categories. Energy prices declined by 13% in 2018 from 23.6% in
2017. The World Bank’s Metals and Minerals Price Index fell by 10.8% in the first three quarters
of 2018 before rising in the last quarter by 2.6%, partly offsetting its bullish ride over the past
couple of years. The lackluster performance of energy, as well as metal and mineral prices in the
late 2018 reflects persistent subdued global growth and prolonged trade tensions.
3.1.2

Regional Economic Performance

Latest statistics provided by Member States in April 2019 and the IMF World Economic Outlook
database indicate that economic recovery in SADC continued in 2018, but there is duality in
growth performance and prospects within the region.
Annual inflation rate eased in general, with only three Member States – Angola, Malawi and
Mozambique recording double digit levels. This largely reflects low demand pressure and stability
in exchange rates coupled with significant decline in global energy prices. The pass-through of
lower energy prices is expected to offset the lingering effects from past exchange rate
depreciation
In the fiscal sector debt vulnerabilities remain elevated in some countries. Weaknesses in public
balance sheets are also weighing on countries’ external positions, with reserve buffers below
levels typically considered adequate in more than half of the countries in the region.
The size of the current account deficit widened in 2018 reflecting imbalances in public accounts,
with public savings-investment deficits about three times as large as for the private sector in nonresource intensive countries. The region is highly vulnerable to terms-of-trade shocks, and these
have a large impact on current account positions, mainly through the trade balance.

Real GDP
In 2018, the trends of growth have been incongruent in the SADC region. Economic growth is
estimated at 3.1% in 2018, a slight improvement from 2.9% recorded in 2017. The economic
performance was largely weighed down by weak global economic conditions and adverse
weather in some parts of the region. Some countries like Botswana, DRC, Lesotho, Madagascar,
Tanzania and Zambia observed strengthened growth levels. Contrary, in Zimbabwe,
Mozambique, Seychelles and South Africa growth rates decelerated in 2018. Only Tanzania
recorded real GDP growth rates above the regional target of 7%.
Consequently, per capita GDP for the region is estimated to have improved slightly from
US$ 4,004 in 2017 to US$4,171 in 2018. All Member States except for Angola recorded positive
growth in per capita GDP in 2018, an improvement from only five Member States (Botswana,
DRC, Mauritius, Seychelles and Tanzania) recording positive growth in 2016.
Inflation
Provisional figures indicate that annual inflation rate eased to 8.1% in 2018 from 9.8% in 2017
(see Fig 2). The decline in inflation is associated with low demand pressure and stability in
exchange rates. A total of 8 Member States (Botswana, DRC, Eswatini, Lesotho, Mozambique,
Namibia, South Africa and Tanzania) met the inflation target range of 3-7%. Five Member States
(Angola, DRC, Madagascar, Malawi, Zambia and Zimbabwe) performed above the target range
of 3-7% for inflation, with Malawi being way out at 21.2%.

National Savings and Investments
A downward trajectory in both average total investments and gross national savings registered
since 2014 continued in 2018. The region is projected to have recorded total investments of 22.8%
of GDP in 2018 compared to 24.4% of GDP in 2017. Only five Member States (Botswana,
Lesotho, Seychelles, Tanzania and Zambia) performed above the regional target of 30% of GDP
for investment (see Figure 3).

On the savings side, the region remained subdued at 19.9% of GDP in 2018, lower than the gross
national savings of 20.6% of GDP realized in 2017. Botswana, Mozambique and Zambia were
the only Member States that attained the regional savings target of 30% in 2018.
Fiscal Sector
Lackluster regional economic performance continued to affect government revenue collections,
in turn disturbing fiscal balance positions in the face of increased expenditure needs (see Figure
4). The fiscal deficit is projected to have recorded 3.8% in 2018 compared to 4% of GDP in 2017.
The decline was observed in Botswana, Madagascar, Malawi, Mauritius, Mozambique, South
Africa and Zimbabwe. In Malawi, the deficit has almost doubled because of the relative
underperformance of domestic revenues, increased humanitarian support to drought-stricken
areas and non-disbursement of aid by some development partners. In Mozambique, the widening
deficit was explained by the absence of new inflows of state windfall revenue in 2018. On the
positive note, Angola recorded a surplus of 0.5% in 2018 in contrast to a deficit of 6.1% recorded
in the previous year.

Public debt maintained an upward trend across all Member State in 2018. The region’s public
debt increased to 49.3% of GDP in 2018 from 48.6% recorded in 2017. The number of countries
that met the regional target of public debt of 60 % of GDP receded from 12 in 2017 to 11 countries
in 2018. All Member States except for Angola, Malawi, Mozambique and Zimbabwe met the
regional fiscal target in 2018. The upsurge in public debt presents several fiscal and monetary
policy implications to Member States (see Box 1).
Box 1: External Debt Dynamics and Implications for Monetary Policy in the SADC Region
On average, external debt is still within manageable levels in SADC countries, with exception
of Mozambique, Zimbabwe and Zambia at high risk of external debt distress. External debt in
the region is, however, vulnerable to macro-fiscal, exchange rate and export shocks. Automatic
debt dynamics, explained by changes in growth rates, exchange rates and interest rates have
been key in influencing debt dynamics over and above the current account and fiscal deficits.
Over the past years, external debt in the region was positively related to inflation, policy rates
and exchange rate depreciation.
There are several fiscal and monetary policy implications of increasing external debt, these
include:
(i) the need to ensure that sovereign external debt does not grow out of hand in the first
place. Though the central bank cannot control this directly, it can play a significant role
by actively and openly supporting enactment of laws to support strong fiscal positions.
(ii) central banks can also play a significant role in the development of domestic financial
markets to ensure shift away from external debt to domestic debt financing, with positive
benefits of enhanced market-based operations for central banks.
(iii) there is need to encourage governments to build fiscal buffers to prepare for servicing
of the maturing external debts.

External Sector
In line with the decline in commodity prices, terms of trade for the region slightly deteriorated in
2018 (see Fig 5). The deterioration of the current account in some countries was due to an
expansion of imports, combined with the decline in exports of goods like in Mauritius, for instance.
Export volumes improved by 2% in 2018 compared to 1% in 2017. After recording 3.2% increase
in 2017, exports increased by 2.7% in 2018. This was largely due to the subdued global
performance, especially in key trading partners such as China and the Euro area.
The current account deficit for the region averaged 5.9% of GDP in 2018, a deterioration from an
average deficit of 4.8 % in 2017. The high level of the current account deficit across the region
had different origins. Notable down turns were recorded in Malawi, Mozambique, South Africa,
Seychelles and Zimbabwe. In Malawi, the current account deficit deterioration was largely
explained by a less diversified export conjugated to non-aggressive import substitution strategy.
In Mozambique, the deficit emanated from an increase of imports of capital goods, fuel and
payment of service related to the gas exploration in the Northern Province of Cabo Delgado. For
South Africa, the shortfall on services, income and current transfers led to a significant deficit of
the current account, despite a surplus in the trade balance. In Seychelles, the higher deficit was
due high imports of goods and services. In Zimbabwe, the exports increase but this was offset by
a large increase of imports (see Figure 5).

In terms of foreign exchange reserves, SADC average import cover remained below the regional
target of 6 months of imports at 4.4 months of imports in 2018, slightly lower than the 4.5 months
of imports recorded in 2017. Only three Member States (Angola, Botswana and Mauritius)
recorded external reserves above the regional target of 6 months import cover. The rest of the
Member States did not meet the criterion of 6 months of import cover, with some of them falling
short of the IMF benchmark of 3 months of import cover.
Business Environment

-----------------------Page 15 End-----------------------

Data from the World Bank Ease of Doing Business 2018-19 indicate that the SADC region
deteriorated in terms of creating a conducive business environment and its competitiveness in
general. Only six Member States showed improvements in the ease of doing business ranking,
namely: Angola, Madagascar, Mauritius, Mozambique and Zimbabwe. Two Member States
(Mauritius and Zimbabwe) demonstrated exceptional improvements by moving up more than 3
positions from 25 in 2017 to 20 in 2018 and 159 in 2017 to 155 in 2018, respectively.
Performance with regard to ease of doing business indicate that DRC, Eswatini, Lesotho, Malawi,
Namibia, South Africa, Tanzania and Zambia slightly plummeted in their ranking positions in 2018
compared to 2017 performance. Similar to 2017, five SADC Member States (Botswana, Mauritius,
Seychelles, South Africa and Zambia) were ranked within the first 100 bracket (see Figure 6).

The development with regard to improving the business environment shows a similar behaviour
if one considers the World Economic Forum Global Competitiveness Index (GCI). The GCI
measures the competitiveness of an economy by considering all factors from basic factors that
enable it to be competitive to factors that make it efficient and innovative (see Figure 7).

improvements by moving up thirty-three positions from 107 in 2017 to 74 in 2018. The other ten
Member States (DRC, Madagascar, Mauritius, Namibia, South Africa, Tanzania, Zambia and
Zimbabwe) deteriorated in the ranking of 2018.
In 2018, Seychelles joined the most competitive and top ranked Member States (Mauritius, South
Africa and Botswana) in the region. Botswana, significantly dropped by 27 positions after it
consistently improved performances over the past four consecutive years.

3.2

REGIONAL ECONOMIC OUTLOOK FOR 2019-20

The global economic growth forecast for 2019 has been revised to 3.3% from 3.5% projected
early this year. Uncertainty arising from trade tensions between the United States and its main
trading partners continues to pose risk to the global growth outlook, with repercussions for SADC
Member States. These tensions, together with the strengthening of the US dollar, have increased
the volatility of some commodity prices and pressured the currencies of emerging countries. If
global demand could continue to slowdown, commodity prices are likely to further decline,
reducing GDP growth and adversely affecting trade and fiscal balances for SADC’s commodity
exporters. The costs of external financing are likely to further increase if interest rates in advanced
countries rise faster than anticipated. With improvements anticipated in the second half of 2019,
global economic growth in 2020 is projected to return to 3.6%. This return is predicated on a
rebound in Argentina and Turkey and some improvement in a set of other stressed emerging
market and developing economies, and therefore subject to considerable uncertainty. Beyond
2020 growth will stabilize at around 3.5%, bolstered mainly by growth in China and India and
recession strains gradually ease in economies such as Argentina and Turkey.
At regional level, economic growth is expected to increase by an average of 2.3% in 2019, a
decline from 3.1% in 2018. As such none of the Member States is projected to achieve the
regional target of 7% growth in real GDP in 2019. The slower-than-expected overall growth is
likely to be driven by the ongoing global uncertainty of the commodity market. At the heart of this
9

-----------------------Page 17 End-----------------------

slow growth are the major headwinds of high inflation, increasing government debt, and slow
growth in South Africa, which contributes about two-thirds of the region’s GDP. The second
largest regional economy, Angola, is expected to grow by 0.4% in 2019 and 2.9% in 2020, while
Mozambique is projected to grow at 4% in 2019 and 2020. Per capita GDP for the region is
expected to moderate from US$4,171 in 2018 to US$3 343,80 in 2019.
Savings are estimated at an average of 20.4% of GDP in 2019, an improvement from 19.9 % of
GDP recorded in 2018. Only Botswana, Mozambique and Zambia are expected to record gross
national savings above the regional target of 30% of GDP. In terms of total investment, the region
is projected to record a slight improvement of 24.1% of GDP in 2019 from 22.8% of GDP in 2018,
with six Member States (Botswana, Lesotho, Mozambique, Seychelles, Tanzania and Zambia)
expected to perform above the SADC 30% of GDP target for investments in 2019.
Inflation in the region is estimated to increase to 11.1% in 2019 from 8.1% in 2018. All Member
States except for Angola, DRC, Malawi, Mauritius, Zambia and Zimbabwe are expected to
achieve the regional inflation target range of 3-7% in 2019. The expected increase in inflation
pressures is likely to be driven by the rebound in commodity prices and low harvest in some parts
of the region.
SADC regional fiscal deficit is expected to improve marginally from 3.8% of GDP in 2018 to 3.3%
of GDP in 2019. A total of five Member States (Angola. Botswana, DRC, Lesotho and Seychelles)
are expected to meet the regional target of fiscal deficit of less than 3% of GDP. Average public
debt for the region is estimated to worsen further to 52.7% of GDP in 2019 from 49.3% of GDP in
2018. All Member States are expected to record public debts below 60% of GDP except for
Angola, Mozambique, Namibia, Zambia and Zimbabwe.
In the external sector, the region’s terms of trade are projected to improve by 2.1% in 2018.
Imports volumes of goods and services for the region are expected to increase by 5.9% in 2019,
compared to 2.4% in 2018. In terms of exports volumes, the region is expected to record an
increase of 5.2% in 2019 compared to an increase of 2.7% in 2018. The current account deficit is
expected to widen by 7.3% of GDP in 2019, from 5.9% of GDP in 2018. All Member States except
Lesotho, Madagascar, Mozambique, Namibia and Seychelles are predicted to record a current
account deficit below 9% of GDP. The region is projected to record a slight decline in external
reserves of 4.9 months of imports in 2019 from the 5.3 months of imports recorded in 2018. Only
three Member States (Angola, Botswana and Mauritius) are projected to record external reserves
above the regional target of 6 months import cover.

4 OVERVIEW OF OUTPUT AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
The year 2018/19 marked the fourth year of implementation of the Revised Regional Indicative
Strategic Development Plan (RISDP) 2015-2020, which was approved by the Extraordinary
Summit in April 2015 in Harare, Zimbabwe.
In order to improve the overall performance towards achieving the planned outputs, a total of 231
outputs were planned in 2018/19 out of which 185 (80%) were successfully completed while 46
(20%) were initiated and ongoing but not completed. The overall performance in the past three
reference periods (2016/17; 2017/18 and 2018/19) outlined in Figure 8 below indicates a decline
in completion rate from 80% in 2016/17 to 79% in 2017/18 to a slight increase to 80% in 2018/19,
translating to a one percentage point increase between 2017/18 and 2018/19 performance. The
10

-----------------------Page 18 End-----------------------

actual number of planned outputs in relative terms has declined over the years from 304 in
2016/17 to 232 in 2017/18 to a further decline to 231 in 2018/19 towards a more focused and
results based planning. However, completion rate has remained relatively steady at around 80%.

The total budget allocation and expenditure for implementation of regional programmes in line
with the RISDP and SIPO for the period 2018/19 was US$54,083,007 (excluding emoluments)
out of which US$43,282,862 (80%) was utilized (see Figure 9). Disaggregation by source of
funding indicates that Member States funding for the same period amounted to US$30,289,293
(excluding emoluments) out of which US$25,910,793 (86%) was utilized. Furthermore, the ICP
contribution was US$23,793,714 out of which US$17,372,070 (73%) was utilized.

The output and financial performance during the year under review remains satisfactory. The
Secretariat remains committed on putting more effort towards improving internal processes and
building internal skills. In 2018/19, strategic efforts were adopted to further improve the overall
output implementation and financial performance such as a shift from activity based planning
approach to results based planning and reporting; mainstreaming of project management and
standardisation of project planning and reporting tools; and systematic reporting on achievements
and results rather than processes. This will in turn improve the overall physical and financial
performance and in turn the realisation of RISDP Priorities.

5 PROGRESS ON IMPLEMENTATION OF RISDP
5.1

INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT AND MARKET INTEGRATION

5.1.1 Industrial Development
The development of regional value chains and their integration into global value chains remains
the main fulcrum for regional integration, sustained growth and industrialisation of the SADC
region. The Costed Action Plan of the SADC Industrialisation Strategy and Roadmap as
approved by Summit in March 2017, identifies six priority value chain clusters namely; Agroprocessing, Mineral Beneficiation, Pharmaceuticals, Capital goods, Consumer goods and
Services. The main achievements in period under review are:
12

-----------------------Page 20 End-----------------------

i.

In facilitating the development of regional value chains, two regional value chain
profiling studies were completed, namely; the agro-processing and services value
chains, and the former was validated in April 2019. This brings the total to four (4)
value chains having been profiled to date in the six priority clusters. The other two are
the minerals and pharmaceuticals value chain clusters.

ii.

Among the key findings of the Agro-processing profiling study 14 product-specific
value chains were selected as having the highest potential for upgrading and
development in the region, both for increased intra-regional trade and integration into
global value chains. Based on data analysed as part of the assessment for selection,
it was found that the SADC region has a trade deficit in most of the selected value
chains, with rice being the largest in this regard. Essentially, this means that the SADC
region continue to rely on the rest of the world for its upkeep. The lack of sufficient
production also means that there was limited feedstock into manufacturing plants and
thus negating opportunities for increased industrial growth.

iii.

In pursuit to diversify industrial production and exports through sinking substantial
investments, the Secretariat secured two value chain project development experts to
assist with the development and marketing of a pipeline of regional value chain
projects in the agro-processing and mineral sectors. Accordingly, a project template
was developed and a Call for Projects was issued in March 2019 with a closing date
of 30 April 2019.

In order to facilitate and coordinate the development, implementation and monitoring of the SADC
Industrialisation Strategy and Roadmap 2015-2063, with specific focus on processes, strategies
and programmes aimed at developing a competitive and productive industrial base in SADC, the
following activities can be highlighted for the year under review:
i.

A Draft Protocol on Industry was developed and following a review and input from
different structures and other bodies in the region, the Draft was considered by the
Ministerial Task Force on Regional Economic Integration (MTF) in June 2019. Once
approved, the Protocol will become a stand-alone legal instrument whose main
objective will be to promote the development of a diversified, innovative and globally
competitive regional and national industrial bases to enable the Region to achieve
sustainable and inclusive industrial development.

ii.

A first Capacity Building Workshop was held on 25-29 March 2019 in Johannesburg,
South Africa to assist Member States in aligning their industrialisation policies and
strategies to SADC’s Industrialisation Strategy and Roadmap (2015-2063) using the
‘Enhancing the Quality of Industrial Policies’ (EQuIP) methodology.

iii.

Member States involved included, Botswana, Lesotho, Eswatini, Malawi,
Mozambique, Namibia, Tanzania and Zambia (all currently supported by the SADC,
EU and Germany partnership Programme, “Strengthening National Regional
Linkages’’ (SNRL) and implemented by GIZ. To allow for continuity and capacity
building of the Secretariat, four (4) staff members were selected to take part in the
training.

13

-----------------------Page 21 End-----------------------

iv.

To ensure that there is increased production and use of SADC raw materials as
feedstock for downstream processing, a SADC Draft Regional Mining Vision (RMV)
and Action Plan was finalised during the year. The RMV is anchored on the tenets of
the African Mining Vision (AMV) and aims at optimising the sustainable developmental
impact of mineral resources extraction across the region whilst being cognisant of the
differing maturity of the minerals sector in the Member States. The Draft RMV and
Action Plan underwent revisions following presentations to the representatives of the
private mining sector in September 2018 and to the public sector and was scheduled
to be submitted for consideration by the Ministerial Task Force on Regional Economic
Integration (MTF) in June 2019.

v.

The study on the Regional Gaps analysis to develop regional programme to improve
Industrial Competitiveness of Member states was undertaken from February to June
2019. The study aims at mapping the situation of the SADC economies; Identify the
constraints against enhancing competitiveness in member states and competitive
integration in production and trade value chains; Identify capacity gaps in
implementing the industrialisation policy and develop regional programme to improve
competitiveness of Member States. The Secretariat has planned validation workshop
to be held on 24-25 June 2019, Johannesburg, South Africa.

5.1.2 Market Integration
The enhancement of intra and extra SADC trade remains a key regional agenda. Key focus areas
in this area include, among others, the simplification of rules of origin and application of improved
methods for certification of origin; establishment and implementation of the Tripartite FTA;
establishment and implementation of the AfCFTA, implementation of the EPA and finalization of
the negotiations and implementation of the schedules of commitments to the SADC Protocol on
Trade in Services and conclusion of preparatory work leading to the establishment of the SADC
Customs Union. The following were notable developments in the year under review:
i.

The first round of negotiations was completed in 4 of the 6 priority sectors identified in
the Protocol on Trade in Services, namely; communication, finance, tourism and
transport services. Negotiations on the remaining two priority sectors (construction and
energy-related services) were scheduled to be finalised during the 39th TNF Services
meeting to be held in the 2019/2020 period before presentation to the 31st CMT for
adoption.

ii.

At the Tripartite Free Trade Area level, work on Rules of Origin is almost finalized with
agreement on 91.55% of the tariff lines as of February 2019. These negotiations and
agreement on the necessary rules of origin manuals are scheduled for completion by
June 2019; and

iii.

At the regional level, the SADC Free Trade Area now covers twelve of SADC’s sixteen
Member States. Except for two Member States currently facing challenges in
implementing their tariff commitments, all the other participating Member States are
fully meeting their obligations under the Free Trade Area. Since 2013, intra-regional
trade in SADC has been consistently above 20% and growing, which can be
considered to be a relatively good achievement compared to the pre-FTA era high of
around 16%.
14

-----------------------Page 22 End-----------------------

iv.

The 12 Member States benefiting from the TRF two (2) windows continued with their
implementation of different activities to achieve the planned results as per their
respective commitments from both the STP and the EPA Windows of the TRF Fund.
As at the end of March 2019, the TRF fund utilization was at 54.5% -i.e a total of
EUR12.422 million was disbursed under Tranche 1 (initial payment of 30% of total
allocation) and partially under Tranche 2 (up to 50% of total allocation). A further
EUR5.218m was due to be disbursed under Tranche 2 to Member States by 30 June
2019 and this would translate into 77% commitment. The remaining EUR5.16 million
will be disbursed under Tranche 3 (balance of 20% of total allocation) from September
2019 onwards. Due to the challenges faced at the start of the Programme, the SADC
Secretariat and the EU have agreed to extend the programme by 24 months from the
initial end date of 30 September 2019 to 30 September 2021. However, Member
States are expected to complete implementation by March 2021 at the latest, leaving
6 months for closure at Member State level and at the SADC level.

To facilitate the harmonization of Standards, Technical Regulations as well as Sanitary and
Phytosanitary measures, with the main view to enhance the regional Trade as pursued by SADC
Protocol on trade, the following were the key achievements in the year:

5.1.3

i.

Sanitary and Phytosanitary (SPS) measures for at least six commodities were
harmonized and notified. The Gap Analysis Report on the Codex System was
developed through convening of the SADC Codex Alimentarius Contact Points in
respective Member States. The findings will be used to mobilise technical assistance
from the Codex Trust Fund.

ii.

In light of the advent of the African Continental Free Trade Area, the SADCSTAN
standards harmonisation procedure was reviewed to align with the African
Harmonisation Model used by the African Regional Organisation for Standardisation
(ARSO). In addition to the Eleven SADC standards that were harmonised in
FY2017/18 and ten more were harmonised in the FY2018/19, bringing the total
number of SADC harmonised texts to 107.

iii.

The COMESA-EAC-SADC tripartite intensified their collaboration around the tripartite
NTBs resolution mechanism, focusing mainly on TBT and SPS as two of the
specialised areas from which NTBs may arise. A benchmarking and knowledge
sharing exercise was undertaken between the EAC and SADC with a view to aligning
their standards development and possible bilateral NTB resolution processes in the
interest of trade.

iv.

At the regional level, Botswana achieved international recognition of its Calibration and
Measurement Capabilities and thus international recognition of the BOBS calibration
laboratories capability. This implies that Botswana can now be identified as another
node at which internationally recognised calibration and measurements can be
obtained.
Trade Facilitation and Customs Instruments

The SADC Trade Facilitation Programme (TFP) was approved in July to support the
implementation of the industrialization strategy and roadmap. The achievements on customs and
trade facilitation in 2018/19 include:
15

-----------------------Page 23 End-----------------------

vi.

Simplified Trade Regime (STR) Framework aimed at reducing barriers to trade by
simplifying the customs procedures and processes, thereby lowering transaction costs
associated with formal trade in support of small traders.

vii.

Regional Framework for the Electronic Certificate of Origin (E-CoO) to enable traders
to apply for the certificate of origin electronically; reduce time for issuance and
transmission to the importing country; determine the origin of benefits thereof from
duty free access to SADC market; and enhance integrity of customs and trade
operations because of less human interference. In the last year, Botswana, Lesotho
Malawi and Zambia developed national modules of the E-CoO while Mauritius is
already implementing.

viii.

Project proposal on trade facilitation needs for Kasumbalesa border post by the
German Government. Two Member States (DRC and Zambia) signed a Memorandum
of Understanding (MoU) on interconnectivity of customs Information and Technology
(IT) systems and data exchange.

ix.

Assessment of the implementation of customs and trade facilitation instruments at
Zobwe/Mwanza (Mozambique/Malawi) towards improvement of border management
efficiency. The assessment identified lack of adequate infrastructure, uncoordinated
operations among border agencies and lack of capacity as main challenges.

5.1.4

Financial Market Integration

SADC continues to support the modernization and harmonization of payments and clearing
systems to improve safety of payments and efficient settlement and payment processes in the
region. Moreover, it is a means of financing priority sectors and driving economic development in
the region. Notable milestones achieved in the area of payment systems are as follows:
i.

At national level, all Member States except for Madagascar, are implementing Real
Time Gross Settlement System (RTGS). The RTGS facilitates quicker transactions
and brings about efficiency in payments;

ii.

At regional level, all Member States except for Madagascar and Comoros are
participating in the SADC-RTGS and 81 banks (central banks and commercial banks)
are participating in the system. The SADC-RTGS has performed impressively since
July 2013 when the system went live, with 1,356,025 transactions settled as at end of
February 2019, representing ZAR5.52 Trillion. However, Central Bank Governors
(CCBG) are still engaging the SADC Bankers Association to ensure that savings
arising from removal of overseas correspondent banks are passed on to consumers;
and

iii.

The SADC RTGS multi-currency platform that initially started with the on boarding of
the US dollar went live in October 2018. Discussions are ongoing with the Federal
Reserve Bank of New York regarding the opening of a US Dollar account to facilitate
US dollar settlement in the SADC-RTGS. On boarding of all the currencies of the
region onto the system is expected to be completed by December 2019.

-----------------------Page 24 End-----------------------

5.1.5

Financial Inclusion and Remittances

In total, 68% of adults in the region are financially included (including both formal and informal
financial products/services) which is around 97 million individuals. This is an improvement from
60% of financially included adult population in 2016. Overall levels of financial inclusion vary
considerably across the region from 97% in Seychelles to 40% in Mozambique. The highest levels
of overall financial inclusion were recorded in Seychelles, Mauritius, South Africa, Botswana,
Lesotho, Namibia, Eswatini and Tanzania.
The SADC Financial Inclusion Strategy and SME Access Implementation Plans were approved
in July 2018. This paved a way for the implementation of activities and assisted Member States
to develop their own Strategies and programmes aimed at empowering the SMEs, youth and
women to participate and contribute to economic activity. Ten Member States including Angola,
Botswana, DRC, Eswatini, Lesotho, Madagascar, Malawi, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe have
developed either their own Financial Inclusion Strategies or a national roadmap on financial
inclusion.
More than 70% of adults in the SADC region have access to cell-phones, but only 27% of the
adults are using mobile money. Tanzania followed by Zimbabwe rank high at 57% and 47%,
respectively, in terms of uptake of mobile money. To deepen financial inclusion through use of
mobile money, CCBG developed mobile money guidelines that are being piloted in Lesotho,
Eswatini, Malawi and South Africa, with the expectation to roll this out to other Member States.
Cross border remittances are critical for financial inclusion and poverty alleviation in the region.
The cost of cross border remittances has been reduced by 7 percentage points from an average
of 20% per transaction to about 13% in the corridor between South Africa and DRC, Eswatini,
Lesotho, Malawi and Mozambique. The challenge is to further reduce these costs to meet the
G20 target of 5% per transaction. As part of this work, a pilot product has been introduced
between South Africa and Lesotho using Shoprite. The Shoprite cross-border money remittance
product reached the R1 billion mark in January 2019, after just three years of its implementation.
The cost of a transfer of R900 is 2%, which is one of the cheapest cross-border products in the
world. It is estimated that the Shoprite Lesotho remittance product has saved approximately R80
million in transfer fees over the three-year period. Approximately 70% of the recipients of these
remittances are women. Given the success of the remittance product to Lesotho, work is
underway to replicate it in the Zimbabwe, Malawi, Mozambique and Eswatini corridors.
5.1.6

Development Finance

SADC Project Preparation Development Facility (SADC - PPDF) continues to support Member
States to strengthen regional infrastructure connectivity by providing grants for project preparation
and development for cross-border regional infrastructure projects. By the end of 2018, PPDF had
approved a total of US$19.6 million for the preparation of nine (9) regional projects covering
energy, transport and water, which is expected to generate US$5.8 billion in infrastructure
investment.
The nine (9) regional projects are Mozambique-Zimbabwe-South Africa Interconnector Project;
Second Alaska-Sherwood 400 kV line (Zimbabwe and the Southern African Power Pool (SAPP));
Kasomeno-Mwenda Toll Road (DRC and Zambia); rehabilitation and upgrade of the North-South
Rail Corridor (Botswana, DRC, South Africa, Zambia and Zimbabwe); Luapula Hydro Power
Development (DRC and Zambia); Angola-Namibia Transmission Interconnector; Mulembo Lelya
17

-----------------------Page 25 End-----------------------

Hydro Electric Power (Zambia, DRC and the SAPP); Africa Green Co (All SADC Member StatesIndependent Power Producers); and development of Guidelines and Standards for Renewable
Energy Projects and a Funding and Incentive Strategy Project in Mauritius.
A PPDF Mid-Term Review consultancy was commissioned by the EU in 2018 to provide an overall
independent assessment of the PPDF’s past performance, paying particular attention to its
intermediate results measured against its objectives. KFW has also commissioned a consultant
for the assessment of the PPDF Phases I and II and the analysis of strategic options for Phase
III.
The Agreement on the Operationalisation of the SADC Regional Development Fund was finalised
and nine Member States have signed the Agreement, namely: Angola, DRC, Lesotho, Malawi,
Mozambique, Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe. None has yet submitted instruments
of ratification of the Agreement with the Secretariat. The Secretariat is consulting and sensitizing
Member States on the need to fast-track signature and ratification of the Agreement to ensure
that the Fund is operationalised. In January 2019 and March 2019, Malawi and Madagascar were
consulted and sensitised.
5.1.7

Investment and Tax Related Matters

SADC is implementing a Regional Action Programme for Investment (RAPI) aimed at improving
the investment and business environment and removing barriers to investment. In that regard,
SADC has developed an Investment Policy Framework (IPF) to guide Member States in
developing their National Investment Action Plans. The IPF is yet to be reviewed by the Joint
Meeting of the Investment Subcommittee and the Trade Negotiation Forum–Services to ensure
that investment issues discussed in the World Trade Organisation (WTO) framework are taken
into account.
Three (3) Member States (Botswana, Malawi and Zambia) have developed National Action Plans
for Investment (NAPI) to facilitate implementation of the SADC Investment Policy Framework. To
support investors in accessing information, SADC has developed an investment portal which is
linked to Member States investment portals. During the period under review the portal was
reviewed to enable remote updating by Member States. The Bilateral Investment Treaty Template
that assists Member States in the negotiation of investment treaties has been reviewed to take
into account regional and international developments. Furthermore, SADC has developed a
Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) Strategy to support mobilization of FDI into the region.
On the taxation side, SADC developed the SADC Model Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement
to assist Member States in the negotiation of tax avoidance agreements, which are critical for
investment and businesses. The network of Double Taxation Avoidance Agreements in the region
has increased from 52 in August 2015 to 59 by December 2018.
5.1.8

Macroeconomic Convergence Programme

Economic growth marginally improved in 2018 but largely remains subdued. Generally, inflation
eased and slight improvements in fiscal deficit were recorded. However, public debt continues to
rise compounded by a burden arising from low performance by State Owned Enterprises.
Economic growth is estimated at 3.1% in 2018, a slight improvement from 2.9% recorded in 2017.
Annual inflation rate eased to an average of 8.1% in 2018 from 9.8 % in 2017. The fiscal deficit is
estimated to have recorded 3.8% of GDP in 2018 compared to 4 % of GDP in 2017. Public debt
18

-----------------------Page 26 End-----------------------

maintained an upward trend across all Member States in 2018. The region’s public debt increased
to 49.3% of GDP in 2018, slightly above the 48.6 percent recorded in 2017.
The majority of Member States underperformed in achieving the agreed macroeconomic
convergence indicators. Four Member States (Botswana, Lesotho, Seychelles and Tanzania) met
the set targets of the primary Macroeconomic Economic Convergence indicators (Inflation, Fiscal
Deficit and Public Debt) in 2018. Only three Member States (Botswana, Lesotho and Tanzania)
met the set targets of the primary indicators in 2017.

5.2

INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT IN SUPPORT OF REGIONAL INTEGRATION

The SADC Regional Infrastructure Development Master Plan (RIDMP) is the region’s blueprint
for development of infrastructure projects for the period 2012 to 2027, which was adopted by the
Summit, as the guiding document in the region’s infrastructure development and rehabilitation
programme. It implements Priority B – Infrastructure Support for regional integration of the
Revised RISDP. The RIDMP focuses on the realization of SADC Infrastructure Vision 2027 and
contributes towards the Industrialization Strategy and Roadmap as well as other regional strategic
frameworks.
5.2.1

Information, Communication and Technology (ICT)

Through the implementation of the Regional Infrastructure Development Master Plan, SADC has
continued to facilitate implementation of the SADC Roaming Project aimed at lowering
international mobile roaming rates. Mobile Network Operators from 11 participating Member
States, with the exception of Angola, Comoros, DRC, Madagascar and Seychelles, have
completed Phases 1 and 2 of the project. Establishment of National Internet Exchange Points and
Regional Internet Exchange Points has resulted in low latency, cost and bandwidth-saving
Internet access to the SADC Internet Users whereby all SADC Member States established at
least one National Internet Exchange Points.
Implementation of the SADC ICT Observatory flagship project aims to secure the region with
reliable, accurate and up-to-date collection and dissemination of ICT information. Member States
were supported to develop Multi-Purpose forms including the SADC Model Household Survey for
ICT Indicators, ICT in Government, ICT in Business, ICT in Research and Innovation, ICT in
Education and Skills and ICT in ICT Sector and Trade in ICT Goods.
The region will benefit from the establishment of the African Centre for the Fourth Industrial
Revolution (4thIR) which South Africa is setting up in collaboration with the International
Telecommunication Union. This is in response to the operationalization of the SADC Declaration
on the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4thIR) through the use of ICTs. The centre will facilitate
creation of an integrated and comprehensive response for Africa to the digital technological
revolution.
The Digital Terrestrial Television (DTT) provides consumers with more efficient use of radio
frequency spectrum as well as better quality pictures and sound. To date, five Member States
namely Eswatini, Malawi, Mauritius, Namibia and United Republic of Tanzania have completed
the SADC DTT Migration while the remaining are on dual illumination and will complete the
process by 2020. A total of 12 Member States, with the exception of Comoros, Madagascar, South
Africa and United Republic of Tanzania, are contributing content for the SADC TV Channel and
the Grid Planning that runs from 6am to 10pm. Presently, the language used is English but at a
19

-----------------------Page 27 End-----------------------

later stage, there will be subtitles in the other two (2) SADC Official languages, to be accessed
using the DTT technology through the Set Top Boxes (STBs).
5.2.2

Energy

Significant progress has been realized towards installation and commissioning of the power
generation capacity in the region. The Region commissioned 4,175 MW power generation and
both Public Utilities and Independent Power Producers commissioned the power plant projects.
The target is to commission 4,883 MW in 2019/20. The recent investments in the renewable
energy technologies and commissioned gas-fired power plants increased the share of other
primary energy sources in the generation mix.
The SADC Centre for Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency (SACREEE) is a regional centre
of excellence launched in October 2018 aiming at promoting and adopting renewable energy and
energy efficiency technologies and programmes contributing to increased access to energy and
energy security of supply. To date Six (6) Member States namely Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho,
Malawi, Mauritius and Namibia have signed the Inter-Governmental Memorandum of Agreement
(IGMoA) for establishing SACREEE.
The Regional Electricity Regulators Association (RERA) was established to facilitate
harmonisation of the region’s regulatory policies on energy among Member States and support
the development of energy regulators in the region. To date, 14 out of 16 SADC Member States
with exception of DRC and Comoros have Energy Sector Regulators whereby and 11 are
participating in RERA activities.
The region approved to migrate towards cost-reflective tariffs. Currently tariffs for most utilities do
not reflect costs of supply. Member States have agreed on a plan to introduce cost-reflective
tariffs in the region. To date, Angola, Eswatini, Mozambique, South Africa, Tanzania, Zambia and
Zimbabwe have lifeline tariff structures that allow for a minimum level of service, while Lesotho
and Malawi have completed the cost of service studies and similar studies are in progress in
Eswatini.
5.2.3

Transport

Through the implementation of the Tripartite Transport and Transit Facilitation Programme
(TTTFP), the draft Vehicle Load Management Agreement and Multilateral Cross Border Road
Transport Agreement was legally “scrubbed” by REC Legal Counsels. Training and capacity
building were conducted with regard to the national transport information systems and the
production of an ISO compliant driving licence in order to raise awareness of the planned systems.
In addition, national TTTFP Focal Persons from the Corridor Management Institutions and SubRegional Organisations received training.
Construction of the Kazungula Bridge in the North-South Corridor progressed well. The bridge
will link Botswana and Zambia and replace the current facility of crossing the river by Ferry. In
addition, One Stop Border Facilities are being constructed on both sides of the river together with
access roads and associated facilities such as staff housing. Frameworks for establishment and
operation of Common Management Area were completed. Completion of the project will facilitate
trade and transport in the region especially for the Member States served by the North South
Corridor.
20

-----------------------Page 28 End-----------------------

Other ongoing projects include, the construction of the Port of Walvis Bay’s New Container
Terminal on reclaimed land which commenced in mid-2014 and is expected to be commissioned
in August 2019. The project will not only provide increased container handling capacity in the Port
of Walvis Bay (Namibia), but will also increase the port’s bulk and break-bulk handling capacity
by freeing up the existing container terminal to become a multi-purpose terminal. Similarly,
implementation of the Dar es Salaam-Chalinze Toll road has (United Republic of Tanzania)
continued, and work entails widening the road between Dar es Salaam and Chalinze from four to
six lanes and converting it into a toll road.
5.2.4

Water

SADC Secretariat provided technical and facilitation support to the Governments of Angola and
Namibia on the Kunene Transboundary Water Supply project. The Lot 1 activities of the Project
were completed. These included the delivery of a new water treatment plant, pipeline and canal
repair works, construction of abstraction points for livestock watering and irrigation abstraction,
and water distribution network for Calueque village. The water transfer canal and pipeline repair
works have ensured reduced system water losses for the water being transferred across the
border into Namibia as well.
Implementation of the Lot 2 activities also progressed well in the Angola Santa Clara town. This
component will also ensure improved assurance of potable water supply to the Santa Clara
community.
SADC Secretariat continued to engage in programmes to increase the knowledge of the
groundwater resource through research and training of the region’s water experts and youth to
increase the knowledge base. The SADC-Groundwater Management Institute offered internship
programme for 27 young professionals involving Member States’ young professionals. Three
Member States (Botswana, Malawi and Zambia) are at an advanced stage in implementing the
pilot projects under the SADC-Groundwater Management Institute Project funded through the
World Bank. Other six countries including Eswatini, Lesotho, Mozambique, Namibia, Tanzania
and Zimbabwe are lining up for the support to finalize sub-grantee agreements.
The Climate Resilient Infrastructure Development Facility (CRIDF) programme continued to
implement a number of projects in the region. In the current second phase, the Makonde/Matema
Water Supply scheme was completed in Tanzania, which involved rehabilitation of the Matema
Water Treatment Plant. The project has ensured clean and reliable water supply to the
community. In addition, construction of several small dams in the East Limpopo in Zimbabwe for
water potable supply, small-scale irrigation, livestock watering and other livelihood projects were
completed.
5.2.5

Meteorology

The Quality Management System (QMS) ensures and enhances the quality of products and
services provided by the National Meteorological and Hydrological Services (NMHSs. A key
imperative has been the requirements for International Civil Organisation (ICAO) for aviation
weather services, which amongst others recommend conformity with International Organisation
of Standards (ISO) 9001 series of quality assurance standards. To date, four (4) SADC Member
States (Angola, Mauritius, South Africa and Tanzania) are ISO 9001:2015 certified. Nine member
states are in progress for QMS certification while two member states are at the stage of
21

-----------------------Page 29 End-----------------------

identification of agencies to support them with the QMS certification process for the 2015
standard.
The SADC Climate Services Centre is currently implementing the Southern African Regional
Climate Information Services for Disaster Resilience Development (SARCIS-DR) Project. The
overall objective of the project is to increase the capability of SADC countries to respond to
climate-induced disasters and to reduce loss of lives and damages to infrastructure, natural
resources and property. So far, the overall implementation of planned activities is at 62%.
To strengthen the capacity of climate experts to generate and disseminate early warning products
and services, a pre-SARCOF training was conducted in August 2018 to capacitate Climate
experts from Member States. The training built capacity of climate experts on new tools to
generate the 2018/19 seasonal climate forecast for their respective countries; and to produce a
consensus forecast for the SADC region that will be presented in the Southern African Regional
Climate Outlook Forum (SARCOF).
In addition, the seasonal climate forecasts for SADC region; and the regional consensus climate
update forecast for the October-November-December (OND) 2018 to January-February-March
(JFM) 2019 rainfall season were reviewed. Based on this information, the SADC Climate Services
Centre issued a range of products including the climate outlook statement and advisories, monthly
updates, weekly drought and flood risk watch and extreme weather alerts.

5.3

PEACE AND SECURITY COOPERATION

Peace and Security Corporation remains a significant precondition for the attainment of regional
integration in the SADC Region. In this regard, the Directorate of the Organ on Politics, Defence
and Security Affairs guided by Article 5 of the SADC Treaty and the SADC Protocols on Politics
and Security Corporation coordinates Member States policies, strategies and activities within the
areas of politics, defence and security. The Organ Directorate discharges its regional mandate
through key areas of Politics and Diplomacy; Defence Affairs and Planning; Public Security; State
Security and Police.
5.3.1

Political Development in SADC Region

The Region has remained peaceful and stable in 2018/19. This notwithstanding, some political
challenges were experienced in the Kingdom of Lesotho, the Union of Comoros and the Republic
of Madagascar. The eastern part of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) also continued to
experience insecurity caused by negative forces and the Ebola outbreak. All cases have been
accorded adequate attention by relevant SADC organs to ensure the attainment of lasting peace
and political stability.
The Region continued to play a leading role in supporting the strengthening of democracy and
good governance through the implementation of the SADC Principles and Guidelines Governing
Democratic Elections as revised in 2015. In this regard, the SADC Electoral Observer Missions
(SEOM’s) were deployed in the Republic of Zimbabwe; the Kingdom of Eswatini; the Republic of
Madagascar; the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) in 2018; and in the Republics of South
Africa; Malawi and Madagascar (legislative elections) in the 2019.

22

-----------------------Page 30 End-----------------------

An Elections Reference Manual was rolled out during the July 2018 elections in Zimbabwe;
September 2018 elections in Eswatini; October/November 2018 elections in Madagascar; and
December 2018 elections in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The Manual marks a significant
stride towards regional commitment to democracy; good governance and quality elections. The
peaceful transfer of power in Madagascar and the DRC after the elections is expected to open a
new chapter in the political sphere in the two countries to enable greater levels of social cohesion;
reconciliation; poverty eradication and economic development.
5.3.2

Conflict Prevention Management and Resolution

Combined efforts of the SADC Facilitator, the Oversight Committee and the deployment of the
SADC Preventive Mission to Lesotho (SAPMIL) were instrumental in stabilizing the political and
security situation in Lesotho. The SAPMIL officially ended its one-year mission in November 2018
after restoring peace, security and stability in the country. Furthermore, the Mediation Support
Unit (MSU) facilitated deployment of the SADC Oversight Committee (OC) in the Kingdom of
Lesotho during May to December 2018. The OC advisory services to the leadership of SADC has
assisted in the de-escalation of tensions in the Kingdom of Lesotho.
The 2018 presidential elections paved way for a peaceful and democratic transfer of power in the
DRC. SADC has maintained its presence in the country through the Liaison Office in the DRC in
support of the political, electoral and security support initiatives.
The overall political and security situation in the Union of Comoros is generally stable but remains
tense due to political differences largely triggered by the constitutional amendments effected in
July 2018 which changed the rotational system for presidency and called for provision of a twoterm five-year presidency, deviating from the five-year term rotational presidency under the old
constitution.
5.3.3

Regional Collective Defence and Security strengthening

A number of key instruments were developed in the public security arena during the year including
the:
•
•

•

Regional Corruption Assessment report, which led to the enactment of legislation to fight
corruption and other related crimes;
tourism UNIVISA legal instrument that seeks to regulate the implementation of the
UNIVISA and ensure that all security vulnerabilities and threats to the region are taken
care of as the Region prepares to pilot the Tourism UNIVISA; and
Law Enforcement and Anti-Poaching strategy (LEAP) consolidated report that highlights
the Member States efforts in fighting these heinous crimes, through amongst others, the
establishment of multi-sectoral National Anti-poaching Task Forces.

The SADC Standby Force (SADC SF) prepared the assumption of its responsibility to provide the
African Union (AU) with capabilities to respond to conflicts through the deployment of multidimensional peacekeeping forces, and to undertake interventions pursuant to Article 4 (h) and (j)
of the AU Constitutive Act in line with the African Standby Force (ASF) objective of promoting
peace, security and stability in Africa.
23

-----------------------Page 31 End-----------------------

The Southern African Regional Police Chiefs Co-operation Organisation (SARPCCO) in
collaboration with INTERPOL, conducted several joint cross border operations to enhance cross
border safety and security. This operation resulted in, amongst others, recovery of stolen
properties; arrest of illegal migrants; and arrests and convictions related to human trafficking.
5.3.4

Consolidation of Democracy in the Region

The consolidation of democratic principles and standards in the Region continued in 2018. The
SADC Electoral Observer Mission (SEOM) supported by the SADC Electoral Advisory Council
(SEAC) conducted observation missions to the Harmonized Elections in the Republic of
Zimbabwe in July 2018; the General Elections in the Kingdom of Eswatini in August 2018; the
Presidential Elections in the Republic of Madagascar in November 2018; the General Elections
in the DRC in December 2018; the General Elections in the Republic of South Africa; the Tripartite
Elections in the Republic of Malawi and the National Assembly Elections in the Republic of
Madagascar, in May 2019. The presence of the SEOMs resulted in the conduct of peaceful,
credible and transparent elections in the above countries.
SADC Electoral Observation Missions will also be deployed to the four Member States holding
elections in 2019, namely the Republics of Mozambique, Botswana, Namibia, and Mauritius. The
SEOMs will provide further support and oversight during elections in 2020 in two Member States
namely the United Republic of Tanzania and the Seychelles.
SEAC efforts to monitor and observe electoral processes in Member States were guided by the
Revised SADC Principles and Guidelines Governing Democratic Elections, the SEAC Strategy
for the Prevention of Electoral-related Conflicts and the SADC Reference Manual on Election
Observation. This has continued to enhance the strategic context for the consolidation of
democracy in the region.
Continued commitment to democracy and good governance principles in the region was further
enhanced under the Regional Peace Training College (RPTC) programme whereby Long Term
Observers from Member States were trained on all aspects of the electoral cycles.

SPECIAL PROGRAMMES OF REGIONAL DIMENSION
Food Security and Environment

Regional Agricultural Policy
The region is implementing the Regional Agricultural Policy (RAP) through the Regional
Agriculture Investment Plan (RAIP) 2017-2022. The project to support the operationalization of
the Regional Agricultural Policy funded by the European Union’s EDF 11 Programme to the tune
of €9.0 million, was launched in March 2019.
The Secretariat for the first time commemorated the World Food Day at a Regional level in
Namibia in October 2018 under the theme – “Our actions are our future. A Zero hunger world
by 2030 is possible”. The event was an opportunity to remind stakeholders that Zero Hunger is
still possible by 2030 if all stakeholders come together and take account of lessons learned, best
practices and all evidence available.

24

-----------------------Page 32 End-----------------------

The SADC Secretariat commissioned a study on “Contribution of fisheries to food and nutrition
security in the SADC region- the role of small-scale fishers, women and youth in the fish value
chains”. The objective of the study was to quantify contribution of the fisheries sector to food and
nutrition security in the region, and make a case for recognition of this sector in the food and
nutrition, and economic planning and development policy dialogues. The study also focused on
how the SADC region can improve livelihood security and gender relations in rural and coastal
fishing communities, through post-harvest fish value chain innovations and social change
interventions.
5.4.2

The Regional Food Security Situation

Rainfall situation during the 2018/19 crop season
Rainfall totals for the October 2018 to January 2019 period were below average in most areas.
Analysis indicates that rainfall for that period may have been the lowest since 1981 for parts of
southern Angola, western Botswana, northern Namibia, western and central South Africa,
Lesotho, western Zambia and western Zimbabwe. Rainfall was also poorly distributed and below
average in western Madagascar, southern Mozambique, and eastern Tanzania.
The low rainfall was associated with a delayed and erratic onset that resulted in reduced planted
area, delaying planting, poor germination and crop establishment, as well as an extended dry
spell in January 2019 that led to moisture stress and permanent wilting. Rainfall resumed in early
February 2019 in most of the affected areas. While these late rains may have been beneficial for
water, fodder and pasture in some parts of the region, it was too late for crop production.
Two unprecedented cyclones (Idai and Kenneth) hit northern, central and southern Mozambique;
southern Malawi; eastern Zimbabwe and Comoros in March and April 2019, causing severe
flooding and destroying more than 800,000 hectares of crop land.
Food Security Outlook for 2019/20 Marketing Year
Preliminary analyses of the crop production and vulnerability assessments suggest that cereal
production is likely to be reduced compared to previous year due to impacts of the low rainfalls
and dry spell in eastern parts of the region. In addition, excessive rainfall and floods in the northeastern parts of the region, including the recent negative impact of the Cyclones Idai and Kenneth
affected the cereal production.
The impact of the reduced cereal production on household food security will be more severe in
those areas already experiencing high numbers of food insecure populations due to poor
production in the previous season and those affected by Cyclones Idai and Kenneth. During the
2018/2019 period, about 30.4 million people were estimated to be food insecure.
The low rainfall and floods also negatively impacted pasture and livestock, as well as water supply
for human, agricultural and other uses, which have all deteriorated in western parts of the region
(particularly southern Angola and northern Namibia).
Food and Nutrition Security Strategy
Eleven SADC Member States (Angola, Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique,
Namibia, South Africa, United Republic of Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe) revised and
25

-----------------------Page 33 End-----------------------

produced the comprehensive and detailed food balance sheets for the SADC Region for the crop
production season 2017/18. The overall regional balance sheet was analysed and published in
July 2018, and the report made available to all SADC Member States and to the public through
SADC Website.
Member States were capacitated on the use of remote sensing and mobile monitoring to better
monitor crop production in the field, and were prepared for the compilation of the next food
balance sheet for the season 2018/19.
Agricultural Input Supply
In an effort to stimulate and increase crop production, productivity and competitiveness as well
as improving market access for crops and their products, SADC Secretariat in collaboration with
Member States developed the draft Crop Development Programme which is being finalised.
Surveillance and Control of Transboundary Plant and Animal Diseases and Pests
The region minimised the impacts of Fall armyworm, which was introduced in the region in 2017
and spread to all SADC Member States except Lesotho and Mauritius through capacity building
and awareness campaigns carried out by governments, development partners including use of
surveillance and monitoring equipment.
Other pests are being closely monitored like Tuta absoluta (Tomato leaf Miner) currently in all
mainland Member States; the Banana Bunchy Top Virus disease found in several countries; the
Fusarium Oxysporum Tropical Race 4, still confined to Mozambique, and the Maize Lethal
Necrosis, only found DRC and United Republic of Tanzania.
The transboundary animal diseases, particularly Foot and Mouth Diseases (FMD), Peste de Petit
Ruminant (PPR), Contagious Bovine Pleuro Pneumonia (CBPP) and Highly Pathogenic Avian
Influenza (HPAI) continued to pose a threat to livestock growth, production and trade in livestock
and livestock products.
Six (6) Member States (Botswana, Madagascar, Mauritius, Namibia, South Africa and Eswatini)
have been declared free of PPR (a disease that kills sheep and goats) by the OIE with Lesotho
expected to apply for declaration of freedom shortly.
From 2014 – 2019 Foot and Mouth Diseases outbreaks have been reported in ten (10) Member
States (Angola, Botswana, Malawi, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, United
Republic of Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe). Some of which occurring in previously designated
FMD free zones, affecting trade of livestock. The Guidelines on Commodity-based Trade
Approaches for Managing Foot and Mouth Disease Risk in Beef in Southern Africa were validated
and recommended for approval by Member States.
The Livestock Technical Committee in December 2018 adopted the Regional Highly Pathogenic
Avian Influenza Emergency Preparedness Plan and recommended it for further review by the
Social Health and Development Technical Committee before recommending for approval by
Ministers.
The funds mobilized under the recently launched, Support for Operationalization of RAP project,
under the European Development Fund 11, will support implementation of strategies towards the
26

-----------------------Page 34 End-----------------------

control of transboundary animal diseases including developing a FMD Progressive Control
Pathway, finalization of HPAI Emergency Preparedness plan and implementation of PPR
eradication Road Map.
Disaster Preparedness for Food Security
The Regional Vulnerability Assessment and Analysis (RVAA) has increased capacities for
Regional and Member States forecasting and Early Warning for food security. Fourteen Member
States have established National Vulnerability Assessment Committees that have also integrated
HIV and AIDS in the annual assessments. In addition, the development of the gender and nutrition
guidelines in 2017/2019 enhanced the ability of the assessments to address women and
adolescent girls’ specific needs, which has been cemented through trainings.
The existence of partnerships such as the non-governmental organisations, ICPs and UN
agencies provides technical inputs in the regional consultations, in the development of the tools
in an inclusive manner. The capacities enabled over the years through the NVACs also support
cross-fertilisation and sharing of information which is supported through the regional information
dissemination platforms.
The 2019/20 assessment will be conducted in consideration of the prevailing food insecurity
situation which has been worsened by the damaging flooding in Comoros, Tanzania,
Mozambique, Malawi and Zimbabwe due to Cyclones Idai and Kenneth, and the severe drought
in Lesotho and Namibia. The RVAA is seeking a sustainability plan for the programme beyond
2022 by enabling institutionalisation outcomes of the NVAC, and this process has commenced in
five Members States.
Joint Management of Transboundary Natural Resources (Wildlife, Fisheries, Forestry, and
Transfrontier Conservation Areas)
The Council of Ministers approved the establishment of SADC Transfrontier Conservation Area
(TFCA) Financing Facility in March 2018. A road map for operationalisation of the Regional
Financing Facility for SADC TFCAs was developed in consultation with International Cooperating
Partner (KfW) and the proposed Executing Agency for the Facility. EUR 12 million has been
allocated by the donor to establish the Facility.
SADC Secretariat further secured financial resources to facilitate implementations of the Joint
Management of Transboundary Natural Resources as follows:
•

EUR 6 Million from the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany (through KfW) to
support capacity building programme for wildlife managers and rangers. This programme
will be implemented as integral part of the SADC Law Enforcement and Anti-Poaching
(LEAP) Strategy. Implementation Agreements are being finalized; and

•

EURO 2 million from WWF for the operationalisation of Regional Fisheries Monitoring
Control and Surveillance Coordination Centre (MCSCC). The project will be implemented
for a period of 5 years starting in 2019.

27

-----------------------Page 35 End-----------------------

Following the successful implementation of at-sea patrols named Operation Jodari, by a coalition
of Tanzanian law enforcement agencies, SADC fisheries Monitoring Control and Surveillance
Coordination Centre through the FISH-i Africa project and Sea Shepherd crew, a regional at-sea
patrol programme was developed, named Operation Vanguard. Sea Shepherd provided the patrol
vessel M/Y Ocean Warrior for these operations, and the patrol vessel remains available to the
region towards implementation of joint ocean and fisheries patrols under Operation Vanguard.
To further support sustainable development of aquaculture in the region, SADC Secretariat
developed Regional Guidelines for Aquaculture Management in the SADC region. The guideline
provides best practices for aquaculture management and incorporate the guiding principles of the
FAO ecosystem approach to aquaculture (EAA).
In addition, Secretariat, working with partners (East Africa Community, FAO and WorldFish)
developed and implemented the SADC Regional Tilapia Improvement Programme, which focuses
on strengthening three national nucleus breeding programmes for tilapi species (Oreochromis
andersonii, O. shiranus and O. mossambicus) to provide readily available germplasm of these
tilapia species for the region.
Conservation of Plant Genetic Resources
SADC Plant Genetic Resources Centre continued to actively support the collection of genetic
material in the Member States. Germplasm collection missions were carried out in nine member
states targeting cow pea, pigeon pea and bambara and trainings on characterization. A Total of
884 samples composed of mixed crops were collected. A total of 2600 crop accession duplicates
were deposited at the Svalbard Global Seed Vault for long term back up storage. A total of 6 100
accessions were tested for viability and 600 accessions were regenerated after losing viability at
the regional genebank at SPGRC.
Other programmes undertaken included on-farm and Community Seed Banks (CSB)
development and training of farmers on managing community seed banks, training on crop
restoration approaches after disasters, climate smart agriculture practices and income generation
activities through local seed multiplication in collaboration with seed companies. All SADC
Member States were trained on the new features of the Web Based SPGRC Documentation and
Information System (SDIS) and the regional data base on plant genetic resources was updated.
5.4.3

Social and Human Development

The Social and Human Development under Priority D of Special Programmes of Regional
Dimension strives to ensure the availability of an educated, skilled, healthy, productive human
resources which remains a fundamental for investment promotion, the efficiency, effectiveness
and competitiveness of the region in the global economy, as well as improving the quality of lives
of the region’s population.
Education and skills Development
The SADC Qualifications Framework (SADCQF) seeks to promote a regionally integrated and
harmonised educational qualifications. It is also aligned to regional commitments such as the
Addis Ababa Convention on the recognition of studies, certificates, diplomas, degrees and other
academic qualifications in higher education in African States, to which the SADC Region
subscribes.
28

-----------------------Page 36 End-----------------------

The approval and adoption of the SADC QF in 2017 continued to contribute to the development
and alignment of National Qualifications Frameworks, (NQF), to regional standards. To date, six
(6) Member States, namely Botswana, Namibia, Seychelles, South Africa, Zambia and
Zimbabwe, have the comprehensive 10 levels of the NQF. Three (3) Member States, namely
Eswatini, Lesotho and Mozambique, are in the next tier of countries whose NQF is being finalised.
The rest of the countries’ NQF typically covers Technical and Vocational Education and Training
(TVET), which remains critically important and relevant in generating technical skills to facilitate
the industrialisation agenda.
The positive impact of the Regional Qualifications Framework (RQF) has been to promote mobility
of professionals across the region, and as such, plays a key role in being the regional reference
point for comparing qualifications obtained in the SADC region. In addition, the Framework
provides a quality assurance mechanism whereby the countries can verify information about
qualifications obtained in the SADC region. The SADC Qualifications Verifications Network
(SADCQVN) was established as an oversight mechanism to ensure credibility and authenticity of
qualifications.
Health and Pharmaceutical and HIV/AIDS
The region has been implementing the SADC pooled procurement services whose objective is to
coordinate the development and harmonisation of policies, guidelines and legislation for
Procurement and Supply Chain Management of essential medicines and health commodities. It
further enhances joint negotiation and joint procurement.
Phase 1 (2007-2016) of implementation which involved setting of the necessary systems and
guiding documents, gave the basis for the full roll out of SADC Pooled Procurement Services
(SPPS). In 2018, the United Republic of Tanzania was selected to host SPPS and signed a MoU
with the SADC Secretariat. The full roll out of SPPS will reduce prices of procurement in the region
and with a sound regulatory environment in the SADC region, there will be improvements in the
procurement of quality medicines in the region.
SADC HIV and AIDS Cross Border Initiative
The SADC HIV and AIDS Cross Border Initiative (CBI)” Programme was implemented in two
Phases, covering the period July 2011 to December 2017. The purpose of the CBI was to provide
basic HIV and AIDS and health services to sex workers (SWs), long distance truck drivers
(LDTDs) and community members in the catchment areas of selected high volume border posts.
The services were provided at 32 Wellness sites that were specifically established for that
purpose in twelve inland SADC Member States.
Statistics indicate that the percentage of SWs, LDTDs and community members living with HIV
significantly declined during the implementation period as shown in Figure 11 below.

(Source: CBI Service Statistics, 2011 to 2017).

Specific achievements include decline in the percentage of SWs living with HIV from 50% in 2011
to 13.2% in 2017 in the project intervention sites, and declines in the percentage living with HIV
among LDTDs and community members were 75% and 60%, respectively. Although there could
be multiple factors responsible for this decline, there is no doubt that structured CBI community
mobilization activities played a major role. It is important to highlight that these statistics apply to
the CBI sites and target groups and not to the general population.
The impacts of the programme include increase in health seeking behaviour among mobile
populations across the region, which potentially increase the quality of life and reduced mortality
and morbidity as a result of HIV and AIDS. More importantly, the programmes have resulted in
availability and increase of health service delivery points in the member states, as well as
improved access to health care services at Member States level in recognition of the fact that
Member States are taking over the facilities and integrating them into existing health programmes
in each Member State.
Malaria Elimination
The signing of the Windhoek Declaration on Malaria Elimination by Heads of States and
Government in 2018 places malaria at the top of the region’s agenda. SADC Member States have
elevated the malaria elimination agenda to the highest political level, endorsing the African Union
“Catalytic Framework to end TB, AIDS and Malaria by 2030”.
SADC member states have implemented legislative policies to support malaria elimination and
universal health care; identified the need to develop local manufacturing capacity to produce
insecticides locally in the region in order to accelerate progress in the elimination of Malaria; and
committed to joint monitoring of the region’s progress towards elimination.
Formal cross-border agreements have been launched within the region to support policy
harmonization and synchronization of malaria activities across connected borders; The TransKunene Malaria Initiative between Angola and Namibia, the ZAM-ZIM Initiative between Zambia
and Zimbabwe, the MOSASWA agreement between Mozambique, Eswatini and South Africa, as
well as the Trans-Ruvuma Cross-border Initiative between Malawi, Mozambique, Tanzania
Mainland and Zambia.
30

-----------------------Page 38 End-----------------------

Advocacy activities with Ministries of Health in the E8 countries have been conducted with support
from the E8, ALMA and the RBM Secretariats to ensure continuous commitment to the Elimination
agenda. The recent Cyclone Idai has had a negative impact on the gains made as it has increased
malaria cases in the three affected countries, which are Mozambique, Malawi and Zimbabwe,
including the neighbouring countries, thus reversing some of the gains that had been made in
malaria elimination. SADC has continued to collaborate and leverage partnerships with regional
and global bodies who share similar goals. To this end, SADC has signed an MoU with the African
Leaders Malaria Alliance (ALMA) and the Roll Back Malaria Initiative (RBM) in the furtherance of
the region’s malaria elimination targets.
5.4.4

Operationalisation of the 38th Theme

In August 2018, at the 38th SADC Summit, the Heads of States and Governments endorsed the
2018/2019 theme of “Promoting Infrastructure Development and Youth Empowerment for
Sustainable Development”. Some of the key initiatives implemented to operationalize the theme
include:
i.

Development of Multimedia Messages with a specific theme or content concerning the
youth, for example the setting up of a hashtag “#SADCYouthtalks #EngageSADCYouths”
where young people across the region engaged and shared information and ideas on the
theme.

ii.

Amplifying Youth voices through facilitating their participation in various platforms
including the Southern Africa Internet Governance Forum; the SADC Youth Forum; the
SADC Industrialisation week; the infrastructure Development Forum, dialogue on
Empowering the Youth through CleanTech and Innovation; and the SADC Youth Dialogue
on engaging Youth in ICT and Transport.

iii.

Convening of Ministerial roundtable discussion themed, “Upscaling Sustainable Energy
for the Industrialisation Agenda and Youth Empowerment for the SADC Region” and a
Cooperating Partners roundtable themed, “Promoting Sustainable Energy for
Infrastructure Development through Regional Cooperation” in October 2018. Both
roundtables explored the ways of getting commitments on accelerating Infrastructure
Development and Youth Empowerment for Sustainable Development, and provided
various recommendations to empower youth in the energy and infrastructure sectors.

Through the fora and platforms, youth got opportunities to discuss key issues pertaining to their
development. They further deliberated on how the governments could facilitate youth involvement
in infrastructure development to enhance youth participation in the productive sectors and ensure
employment creation for young people; and the need to develop regional initiatives to empower
and enhance youth and women access to technology and innovation, capital and credit to start
ups; Through some of such forums the youth stressed the need for the SADC Secretariat to
organize the SADC Youth Engagement on ICT and Transport Dialogue every year to facilitate
dialogue on important matters, and to prepare Youth Statements that would be presented to the
SADC Ministers responsible for ICT and Transport.

5.4.5

Orphans, Vulnerable Children and Youth

With support from the Swiss Development Cooperation, the Secretariat developed an M&E
framework with indicators for reporting on Orphans, Vulnerable Children and Youth (OVCY)
programmes. The Framework has been finalised and the agreed indicators will be uploaded on
SADC MER framework to facilitate use and reporting by Member States. This project will
strengthen reporting on OCVY at Member states level and build on the national Information
Management Systems (IMS).
5.4.6

Employment and Labour

In order to harmonise regional standards for access to accrued social security as well as to close
the existing information gaps on portability, the Secretariat is finalising in depth studies that are
investigating social security arrangements vis-à-vis the agricultural, mining and financial services
sectors in eight Member States (Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia,
South Africa and Zimbabwe).
The preliminary findings from the studies have shown that there is still widespread lack of access
to social security benefits by migrants, revealing a need for the following measures:
i.

Comprehensive review of polices and legislation in a number of countries to enable
migrants’ participation in social security schemes;

ii.

Promotion of regular migration so that migrants are documented and eligible to
contribute to social security schemes during their employment; and

iii.

Strengthening of harmonisation benefit schemes and enhancement of coordination of
national social security systems in the region to make portability easier.

The overall findings from the studies will inform the development of a comprehensive portability
agreement for Member States.
5.4.7

Nutrition

The Secretariat conducted the regional mapping of the status of micronutrient fortification
legislation in the region, with the aim to develop the minimum standards for food fortification to
address micronutrient deficiencies in the region. The preliminary results of the legislative mapping
were validated during the regional nutrition workshop in March 2019, and the draft micronutrient
levels for the regional standards were proposed to inform Phase II of the assignment.
In addition, the Secretariat completed the roadmap for developing guidance on monitoring
framework for food fortification, which was approved for implementation by SADC Ministers of
Health in November 2018; and Member States support needs were identified for technical
assistance by the partners.
With UNICEF support, Secretariat secured a legal expertise to support the assessment of legal
implications of implementation of the Code, Maternity protection and WHA Resolution 69.9 in the
SADC Member States, and the development of regional standards for marketing of breastmilk
32

-----------------------Page 40 End-----------------------

substitutes. Through this support, draft regional standards for marketing of breastmilk substitutes
were also produced.
In collaboration with the World Bank, UNICEF supported the convening of a Nutrition High Level
forum of SADC decision Makers resulting in a call to action for nutrition spearheaded by the King
of Lesotho, an AU Champion for nutrition in October 2018 in Maseru, Lesotho. Additionally, the
SADC Council of Health Ministers meeting took the resolution to adopt the call as a “The regional
call to action for nutrition” with the aim to increase advocacy for investment in nutrition.
Data for nutrition, HIV and WASH indicators have been strengthened and included in the SADC
vulnerability assessment synthesis report. In addition, an Analysis Guidance document for
integrated analysis of nutrition, HIV/AIDS and gender indicators was developed in 2018, based
on information gathered from vulnerability assessment committee chairs and members in
Lesotho, Malawi and Zimbabwe. The guidance document is planned to be disseminated in 2019.

6 INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK FOR PROGRAMME COORDINATION
SADC Regional-National Linkages
Implementation of the Strengthening National Regional Linkages Programme (SNRL)
commenced in September 2018. The Programme which is co-financed by the European Union
and the Government of the Federal Republic of German seeks to enhance the capacity of SADC
Member State structures to facilitate and coordinate implementation of the regional agenda at
country level.
The country coverage of SNRL is expanding from 5 countries that were supported in the earlier
SNRL programme (Malawi, Mozambique Namibia Tanzania and Zambia), to 8 countries bringing
on board Eswatini, Botswana and Lesotho. Furthermore, the support that to be provided will be
more targeted at results, focusing on activities with impact, hence the focus on sectoral
coordinating structures in the three priority sectors of Agriculture, Infrastructure development and
Industrialisation.
Aligned to the Revised SADC Regional Indicative Strategic Development Plan (RISDP), the
programme is envisaged to strengthen country-level structures to manage and monitor the
implementation of the Revised RISDP and prioritised protocols.
Strategy Development
SADC is undertaking a comprehensive Mid-term review of the Revised RISDP 2015-2020 in
preparation for the development of the RISDP Post 2020 and Vision 2063 which has commenced.
The overall objective of the Review is to assess and take stock of achieved results at output and
outcome level, challenges encountered in the implementation of the revised RISDP and SIPO,
document the lessons learned and draw strategic recommendations to inform implementation of
the remaining period of the Plans as well as the Post 2020 Agenda. Ultimately, findings of the
Review will inform the process of formulating SADC’s Vision 2063 and RISDP 2020-2030.

33

-----------------------Page 41 End-----------------------

Statistics
SADC developed a draft Protocol on Statistics as a policy instrument to guide and enhance
cooperation in statistical matters. SADC also produced an annual bulletin of SADC region on
economic performance, trade liberalization and demographic characteristics. Furthermore, with
technical and financial support from IMF, a roadmap for implementation of trade in services
statistics for SADC region by partner country was validated and real sector statistics have been
enhanced.
Planning and Programming
SADC continues to undertake Planning and Programming functions in line with the 2012 SADC
Policy for Strategy Development, Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation (SPME Policy). The SPME
Policy’s purpose is “to strengthen SADC’s decision-making process regarding priority setting,
resource allocation and programme management to improve performance towards SADC’s
objectives”. The Annual Corporate Plan (Operational Plan and Budget) for 2018/19 was prepared
and adopted by Council in March 2018. Operationalization of the Annual Corporate Plan is
interconnected to other key management processes such as strategy development, budgeting,
resource mobilisation, monitoring and evaluation, procurement and management information.
Monitoring, Evaluation and Reporting
Systems strengthening has been core for the Secretariat to deliver expected RISDP and SIPO
results. The SADC Online M&E System facilitate reporting by Member States and the SADC
Secretariat, where it monitors RISDP outputs, decisions of the SADC Policy Structures (Summit,
Council, Cluster and Sectoral Ministers, and the Board of Auditors), Strategies, Protocols,
Sectoral Development Plans and Operational Plans of the Secretariat.
In rolling out the system to Member States and capacitating the Secretariat staff to use the system,
a total of 219 participants in five Member States were successfully trained on the use of online
Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) System and review of implementation of the Revised RISDP as
follows: 36 in Lesotho; 40 in Mauritius; 40 in Eswatini; 65 in Zambia; and 38 in Zimbabwe. In
addition, thirty (30) SADC Secretariat staff were also trained on use of the Online System to
enable efficient monitoring and reporting on implementation of the Revised RISDP, and Summit
and Council Decisions. Monitoring and Evaluation frameworks for Trade Related Facility Project;
Trans frontier Conservation Areas; and Orphans, Vulnerable Children and Youths were
developed. In addition, indicators for Education and Skills Development programmes; and
Science, Technology and Innovation were developed.

CONTINENTAL COOPERATION AND INTEGRATION

The Secretariat continued to engage with the African Union in promoting continental
integration in line with the Treaty establishing the African Economic Community,
commonly referred to as the Abuja Treaty, of 1991. In this regard, SADC participated in
tracking implementation of the continental integration agenda through the AU Executive
Council and Assembly Meetings. In addition, technical engagements preceding these
statutory meetings also contributed towards integration of SADC views in the work of the
Union.
Secretariat continued to track implementation of the various reforms and contributing to
the process through engagement at the technical level with the AU Commission, and at
the political level with the AU Permanent Representatives Committee (PRC), Executive
Council, and Assembly of Heads of State and Government. This engagement has yielded
positive results in that the majority of SADC’s concerns with the reform process were
addressed, and SADC’s position safeguarded.
The Secretariat further, engaged with the negotiations for a Post-Cotonou Partnership
Agreement between African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) Group of States and the
European Union, to succeed the Cotonou Agreement that expires in February 2020. The
negotiations are progressing steadily, and SADC’s position that the negotiations should
be conducted within the broader framework of the ACP prevailed over the proposal that
Africa negotiates separately from the other continents. Importantly, while the Foundation
Agreement is being negotiated within the framework of the ACP, Africa and the EU will
also negotiate a protocol to govern cooperation between the two continents to be annexed
to the ACP-EU framework.
The Secretariat also collaborated with the AUC on the issues of Peace and Security and
the broader agenda of Silencing the Guns in Africa by 2020 through, among others, the
Africa Peace and Security Architecture (APSA) Programme.

DEVELOPMENT COOPERATION AND RESOURCE MOBILISATION

To inform the development of the SADC Regional Resource Mobilisation Framework, in 2018/19,
the Secretariat conducted an in-depth economic impact assessment of the viability of the
proposed options, specifically, those on Import Levy, Tourism Levy, Transport Levy and Financial
Transaction Tax. This is in addition to the benchmarking missions that were conducted to the
African Union Commission (AUC), the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS),
The Economic Community of Central African States (ECCAS) and the Republic of Rwanda.
The draft SADC Regional Resource Mobilisation Framework was finalised and presented to
Council at its meeting in August 2018, and thereafter to the joint meeting of Senior Treasury
Officials and Central Bank Governors for review at its meeting in March 2019 as directed by
Council. Senior Officials recommended the draft SADC Regional Resource Mobilisation
Framework for adoption by Ministers of Finance and Investment and approval by Council.

The Secretariat also continued to enhance strategic engagement with the International
Cooperating Partners (ICPs) in order to facilitate mobilisation of resources for the implementation
of the priority regional programmes and projects that are aligned with the SADC priorities. In view
of this, several agreements and other legal instruments were concluded with a number of ICPs,
who continued to extend their support both technically and financially.

9.1 SADC – AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK COOPERATION
SADC and the African Development Bank (AfDB) have had a long-standing bilateral partnership
for development, which has produced substantial results in the priority areas of cooperation at
both regional and national level. Since 1998 when the first cooperative agreement was signed
between SADC and AfDB, a number of regional projects have been implemented.
Following extensive engagements between SADC and AfDB at different levels to explore
cooperation in the context of the Bank’s High Five Initiatives and in line with the SADC regional
priorities, an Aide Memoire was signed between the SADC Secretariat and AfDB in 2018 to
reaffirm the agreed areas of cooperation. In view of this, both sides have jointly developed a Work
Plan for the implementation of the agreed areas as follows:
i.
ii.
iii.
iv.
v.

Development of SADC Regional Infrastructure Projects;
SADC Industrialisation Strategy and Roadmap;
SADC Regional Development Fund;
Development of Financial Instruments; and
Regional Strategy for Drug Abuse and Cybercrime

This led ultimately to the Bank committing UA2 million to support the implementation of the agreed
areas of cooperation. In Addition, the AfDB continues to provide support for the implementation
of programmes in the SADC region through bi-lateral cooperation with individual SADC Member
States and cooperation with the Secretariat for regional programmes.

9.2 SADC – EU COOPERATION
The European Union continues to be a strategic partner for SADC, particularly in pursuing our
regional economic integration and peace and security cooperation agenda. The SADC-EU
Cooperation is currently implemented through the 10th and 11th EDF Regional Indicative
Programmes (RIP). The 10th EDF RIP (2008-2013) is mainly on its closure phase, with some
programmes that have been granted no-costs extensions.
The 11th EDF RIP covers three focal areas: Peace, Security and Regional Stability; Regional
Economic Integration; and Regional Natural Resource Management with the following resource
envelopes;
i.
ii.
iii.
iv.
v.

Sub- Regional Envelope
Infrastructure Envelope
Cross –Regional Envelope
Technical Cooperation Facility Envelope and
Reserve Envelope

From the Sub-regional envelope, SADC was allocated 90 million Euros. The Secretariat, in
collaboration with the EU, is in the process of programming its €90 million allocation of the Sub regional envelope through formulation of the following projects;

-----------------------Page 52 End-----------------------

i.
ii.
iii.
iv.

Regional Natural Resources Management
Peace, Security and Regional Stability
Regional Economic Integration and
Institutional Capacity Building

From the Infrastructure Envelope, RECs will benefit through joint identification and
implementation of hard and soft infrastructure projects. For hard infrastructure, an indicative list
of 30 pipeline projects has been regularly updated to allow for a swift uptake of the €200 million
tranche committed to the Africa Investment Platform. For soft infrastructure, the RECs who are
jointly implementing the RIP are in the process of preparing soft infrastructure projects in the
areas of Energy, Transport, ICT, Aviation, Maritime Transport and Railways. Energy and
Transport projects worth €27 million have been approved by the EU and are under
implementation. ICT and Air Transport programmes worth €10.8 million have passed the quality
review stage and are likely to be approved during the calendar year 2019.
From the Cross-Regional Envelope of €205 million, the EU and the RECs agreed to allocate
funding for activities of a cross-regional nature for joint identification and implementation. These
are projects that transcend the geographical borders of one REC. A notable progress has been
made in the formulation of cross-regional projects under the 11th EDF
The RIP earmarked €15 million for a TCF to fund the identification and formulation of projects, as
well as costs related to the participation in and hosting of High Level Group meetings. €10 million
was committed under the Annual Action Plan (AAP) 2015 and split among the five Regional
Organisations. The remaining €5 million will be committed at a later date. The €10 million was
divided into a 30% allocation for Cross-Regional actions and a 70% allocation for sub-regional
actions
Moreover, a mid-term review for the RIP was conducted in 2017 and the recommendations are
yet to be implemented. This may impact on the financial overview of the RIP.

9.3 SADC-GERMANY COOPERATION
SADC and Germany have had a long-standing bilateral partnership for development, which has
produced substantial results in the priority areas of cooperation. Since 1985, the total volume of
bilateral Technical and Financial Cooperation (respectively through GIZ and KfW) provided by the
Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ) to the SADC Region
exceeds €341 million. Germany provides further support to the SADC Regional Integration
Agenda through its contributions to the EDF by virtue of its membership to the European Union;
and has continued to cooperate with individual SADC Member States under bilateral cooperation
as well as other sub-regional and national SADC institutions.
The objective of SADC-Germany Cooperation is to enhance SADC's capacity as the main
coordinating body for regional integration in the Region. Areas of cooperation are agreed through
SADC-Germany Bilateral Negotiations on Cooperation. In June 2017, Germany committed to
extend support to SADC to the value of 39.5 million Euro for technical and financial cooperation
programmes, and both sides agreed to jointly support the 7 projects as follows:

The next Bilateral Negotiations between the SADC Secretariat and the Government of the Federal
Republic of Germany are planned to take place in Botswana in November 2019. In preparation
for this, the SADC-Germany High Level Consultations on development cooperation were held in
Gaborone in February 2019 to, among others; review implementation of on-going programmes
and discuss future areas of cooperation to be agreed upon at the next Bilateral Negotiations of
November 2019.

9.4 SADC – CHINA COOPERATION
SADC’s cooperation with the People’s Republic of China is guided by the Forum on China–Africa
Cooperation (FOCAC) Action Plan outlining cooperation in political, economic, social
development, cultural and security areas. In a bid to enhance SADC-China Cooperation, the
SADC Secretariat participated in a mission to China in the margins of the 2018 FOCAC Summit,
which was held in Beijing, Peoples Republic of China in September 2018.
The purpose of the mission was to represent SADC at the 2018 FOCAC summit, as well as, to
explore available opportunities for; support and cooperation between China and SADC, especially
in the fields of trade, peace and security, investments and infrastructure development.
In line with the above, both sides finalized the Framework Agreement on Economy, Trade,
Investment and Technical Cooperation between SADC and the Government of the People’s
Republic of China, to enhance cooperation on areas of mutual interests in tandem with the
aforementioned SADC Strategic Frameworks. The signing of the Framework Agreement is
planned for 2019.

9.5 SADC – RUSSIA COOPERATION
SADC and Russia have concluded two major milestones on cooperation in 2018, through the
signing of the two Memorandum of Understanding (MoUs). These are the MoU between the
Government of the Russian Federation and the Southern African Development Community in the
Area of Military-Technical Cooperation that was signed in July 2018; and the MoU on Basic
Principles of Relations and Cooperation that was signed in October 2018, to guide cooperation
and provide a framework for cooperation between SADC and Russia.
The main objective of the MoU in the Area of Military-Technical Cooperation is to promote
cooperation between Russia and SADC to enhance their capacity to participate in and contribute
to maintenance of regional and international peace and security, in line with the Strategic
Indicative Plan of the Organ (SIPO). The areas of cooperation envision cooperation in the military
technological and technical areas particularly in the fields of, but not limited to, joint military
production, research, development, and technology transfer as well as in military training and
supply of arms and military equipment.

On the other hand, the MoU on Basic Principles of Relations and Cooperation aims to contribute
to the vision of a common future that will ensure economic well-being, improvement of the
standards of living and quality of life, freedom and social justice and peace and security for the
peoples of SADC Member States and Russia. Through the MoU, SADC and Russia intend to
promote mutually beneficial cooperation in political, industrial development, trade, economic,
humanitarian, scientific, technical, social, and cultural and other fields of mutual interest, and
agree to take steps in order to create favourable conditions for socio-economic development
cooperation between SADC and Russia.

9.6 SADC – ICP DIALOGUE PLATFORM
The last SADC-ICP Dialogue Platform Meeting was held in November 2018. The objective of the
meeting was to facilitate the dialogue, coordination, complementarity and alignment between
SADC and the ICP partners. It also facilitated the update on the achievements made in the SADCICP Thematic Working Groups focusing on implementation of activities and main contributions to
the regional strategy and policy priorities.
Furthermore, in order to enhance strategic engagement with ICPs in line with the adopted SADCICP Partnership Statement and Generic Terms of Reference, Thematic Group Meetings were
held regularly. The Peace and Security Thematic Group was also launched and the ICT Thematic
Group supported with the identification of co-chair from the ICPs side. These Thematic Group
Meetings enhanced engagement with ICPs and facilitated information sharing for effective
utilization of resources to be aligned to SADC priorities.

10 CONCLUSIONS
Significant progress was made in 2018/19. The region has remained relatively calm with stable in
terms of both political and economic developments. On the one hand, the Secretariat has made
strides towards ensuring that there are amongst other, policies and guidelines to guide election
processes in the Region. All the elections in 2018/19 were observed and the processes were
successful in what was concluded as democratic and free election. On the other hand, the
economy has remained relatively stable with a global decline observed in 2018.19.
Continued efforts towards implementation of key programmes of regional cooperation and
integration indicates a slight improvement in implementation of planned outputs in line with the
approved Annual Corporate Plan. This is in turn translated to an increase in the overall
expenditure for both Member States and ICP budget. The Secretariat continues to mobilise
resources to further increase implementation of the Regional Integration Agenda and further
through continental cooperation and integration.
The report highlights major challenges across the different interventions. However, the Secretariat
continues to implements measures to further improve the performance. In 2018/19, staff
recruitment process was achieved as planned, with staff complement relatively in line with the
Secretariat structure. Critical areas such as Project Management Unit was staffed to improve the
overall coordination and management of projects and programmes. As such, more standardised
and systematic approach will be adopted and it is under this auspice that the overall utilisation of
ICP funding will increase while strategic objectives outlined in the Revised RISDP and SIPO are
achieved.
