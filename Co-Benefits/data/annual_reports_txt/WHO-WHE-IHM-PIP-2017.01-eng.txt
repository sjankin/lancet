OVERVIEW
A world better prepared
There is no telling where or when the next
pandemic influenza virus will emerge, nor how
severe the resulting pandemic will be. It could
compromise the health of millions of people
and disrupt societies and economies across the
world. That makes it vital for the global health
community to develop and strengthen capacities
to identify new influenza viruses as soon as they
emerge, quickly assess their pandemic potential,
and enable a timely and effective response.

79%

of 43 PIP priority
countries have
improved their L&S
capacity, including
the ability to detect
novel viruses

Helping countries to strengthen their
preparedness for the next pandemic is the subject
of the WHO’s Pandemic Influenza Preparedness
(PIP) Framework. Adopted in 2011, the Framework
aims to improve global detection, surveillance,
and sharing of influenza viruses with pandemic
potential, and to increase the availability of, and
access to, vaccines and other important pandemic
response products during influenza pandemics.
The Framework includes a benefit-sharing
mechanism called the Partnership Contribution
(PC) that supports activities to build or strengthen
preparedness capacities in developing countries.
The PC is collected as an annual cash contribution
from influenza vaccine, diagnostic and
pharmaceutical manufacturers that use the WHO
Global Influenza Surveillance and Response
System (GISRS). A total of US$ 43.8 million was
spent on preparedness in 2014-16, including
US$ 17.1 million in 2016*. For more details, see
Annex 1: Finances. These funds have been used
to support activities across five different areas of
work, each of which includes targets designed
to measure annual improvement in global
preparedness for pandemic influenza. In all five
areas, progress towards those targets is on track
(see Figure 1).

88%

of 16 PIP priority countries now
have institutional development
plans that improve the
regulatory capacity to oversee
and accelerate approval of
pandemic influenza products

INTRODUCTION
A global initiative to help the world prepare
for the next influenza pandemic

In 2011, WHO Member States
adopted the Pandemic Influenza
Preparedness (PIP) Framework
to improve global pandemic
influenza preparedness and
response. The Framework has two
pillars: promoting timely sharing
of influenza viruses with human
pandemic potential through the
WHO-coordinated network of
public health laboratories called
the Global Influenza Surveillance
and Response System (GISRS), and
increasing the equity of access to
benefits arising from such sharing.
The Partnership Contribution (PC)
is a benefit-sharing mechanism
that supports preparedness
capacity-building in developing
countries. Paid by influenza vaccine,
diagnostic and pharmaceutical
manufacturers that use GISRS,
the PC is used in many ways to
strengthen pandemic preparedness
capacities in five different areas of
work that were identified as critical
to strengthening global pandemic
preparedness. The five areas of
work are shown in Figure 2. For
more information on each of
these areas of work, including a
full list of targets, outcomes,
outputs, indicators and activities,
see the Partnership Contribution
Implementation Plan 2013–2016. 1

UNDER THE SPOTLIGHT:

the PIP review

It has been six years since the
PIP Framework was adopted by
the World Health Assembly. In late
2015, an independent group of
experts was convened to review
the Framework’s work so far and
assess the extent to which it has
improved global preparedness.
The review group analysed
implementation of the Framework
and its achievements, including
the PC. It examined outputs,
methods and interactions with
other programmes and partners.
It also consulted widely with
diverse stakeholders, including
representatives from WHO Member
States, the PIP Advisory Group (AG),
GISRS, notably WHO Collaborating
Centres5, industry, civil society,
genetic sequence databases and
initiatives, and WHO staff.

2016 (http://apps.who.int/gb/ebwha/pdf_files/EB140/
B140_16-en.pdf?ua=1, accessed 30 June 2017).

In its final report, the review group
said the PC has fostered “sustained
and meaningful capacity building in
PIP priority countries in each of the
five areas of work”. That is not to say
there are no challenges.
As such, the review group made a
few key recommendations related
to PC implementation:
1 P
 C implementation measures
should be better communicated
in regular Advisory Group reports
and post-meeting briefings to
highlight reports (Rec #2b)
2 G
 ive the PIP Advisory Group
regular financial reports to ensure
financial accountability (Rec #26)
3 C
 ommunication and
transparency should be
enhanced around issues such
as selection of countries for PC
funds (Rec #2c)
4 C
 onsider including process
measures for PC implementation
(Rec #25)
5 C
 onsider lessons learned from
GAP (Rec #34)
6 A
 ctivity under the PIP Framework
should be undertaken with the
provisions of the International
Health Regulations (2005) in mind,
and capacity building efforts
aligned (Rec #35)

Laboratory

Improving abilities to detect, monitor and
share novel influenza viruses
The PC helps 43 PIP priority countries
strengthen their preparedness capacity
in all three areas, with PC funds being
used to strengthen GISRS laboratory
and surveillance systems by helping to:

Being prepared for an influenza
pandemic requires effective
surveillance. To achieve that, a
country must be able to detect
influenza viruses, monitor their
epidemiology and assess their
risks. The ability to share influenza
viruses and information underpins
both detection and monitoring
efforts, and is key to recognising
global patterns of influenza,
understanding the pandemic risk
of different viruses, and choosing
appropriate viruses for vaccine
production.

Triple training win
in Viet Nam

6

From Bangladeshi technicians reporting
epidemiological data to FluID for the first
time to Armenian specialists shipping virus
specimens with more confidence, participants
of PC-funded training across the world
are putting their new skills to use. There is
little doubt that by investing in training, PIP
PC funds are helping to improve national
capacities to detect, monitor and share novel
influenza viruses.
In Viet Nam, PC-supported training in
2016 has given the country a triple win in
laboratory and surveillance:
1 S taff at Viet Nam’s two National Influenza
Centres (NICs)7 were trained by the National
Serology Reference Laboratory in Australia
(NRL), one of WHO’s Collaborating Centres,
in bioinformatics. As a result, both centres
can analyse virus sequencing data with
more confidence.
2 T hese same staff received follow-up training
in External Quality Assessment (EQA),
which led to their contributing to the
development of national EQA programmes
– including influenza EQA – for public
health laboratories across the country.
3 T wo three-day training courses – this time
in clinical management – were given to 79
doctors and nurses from local hospitals in
eleven central and west highland provinces
where there is a high risk of avian influenza.
These health workers care for patients in
remote areas, with little opportunity to
update their medical expertise and capacity.
Now, thanks to PIP-funded training, new
knowledge and skills are being put to
use in managing SARI cases in the field.
The training has also laid the foundations
for knowledge exchange by giving rise
to a network of peers in SARI clinical
management that can share expertise and
experiences.

Viet Nam has two National Influenza Centres: the National
Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology (NIHE) in Hanoi, and the
Pasteur institute in Ho Chi Minh City (PIHCMC).

Deepening the impact of training in Africa
PC-funded training covers
a broad range of topics and
activities that strengthen
laboratory and surveillance systems
in different ways (see Figure 7). In
Africa, the PIP team and partners
used a combination of tactics to
deepen the impact of a recently
completed training programme in
sentinel surveillance.
First, they adopted a ‘train the
trainer’ approach to extend the
reach of knowledge transfer.
Partners from across the African
continent attended a workshop in
September 2016 in the Republic of
Congo’s capital, Brazzaville, to learn
how to deliver sentinel surveillance

training. In the six months that
followed, they collectively rolled
the training out to 12 countries,8
with plans for further training next
year.
The team then updated the existing
protocol for African policy-makers9
and disseminated it in the region’s
three major languages (English,
French and Portuguese). The
protocol, which covers all aspects of
surveillance, from epidemiology to
laboratory and data management,
serves as a general instruction
manual for countries wanting
to establish influenza sentinel
surveillance.

But every country is different so
the team implemented a third
approach to support their training –
working with individual countries to
help them customize the protocol
to their own national context. To
date, the team have helped all
the PIP priority countries in the
region.
This three-pronged approach has
boosted the impact of PC-funded
sentinel surveillance training across
the African continent. By giving
countries tailored guidance and
tools, it has also helped GISRS
to expand the global influenza
surveillance network to Chad,
Gabon, Guinea and Malawi.

Towards robust detection

PIP PC funds contribute to the programme by covering the cost of preparing and distributing
the panels to participating countries and by supporting the analysis and communication of
results. There is evidence that the quality of the network as a whole is improving. In 2016:
7% of countries correctly identified all samples – of both seasonal and avian influenza

It takes more than training to build robust systems for detecting influenza viruses. Just as
important is the need for laboratories to generate regular and reliable results. The WHO’s
External Quality Assessment Programme (EQAP)10 monitors the quality of PCR testing at GISRS
laboratories (as well as non-GISRS laboratories that want to participate).

-----------------------Page 16 End-----------------------

Strengthening surveillance
around the world
Because it is not possible to predict
where or when a novel influenza virus will emerge, it is critical
that all countries have the capacity for early event detection and basic monitoring.
But many developing countries lack the necessary infrastructure for effective
surveillance and have limited resources to address the problem.
In these contexts, PC funds have proved invaluable,
as shown by the examples that follow.

From theory to practice
Having a plan of what to do is an essential part of being ready to act during an emergency. That
is why PC supports health authorities across the world to develop plans and procedures for coping
with a pandemic. But will these plans work when a crisis hits? This year, some of them have been
put to the test as countries have had to cope with actual outbreaks.
In Cambodia, PIP and partners promote a
‘One Health’ approach to planning, bringing
human and animal health sectors together
to identify unusual influenza events and
take joint action. In May 2016, when an
outbreak of avian influenza killed large flocks
of poultry in Kampot Province, the approach
went from theory to practice. The Ministry
of Agriculture, Forestry and Fishery kickstarted a joint response by reporting the
poultry deaths to the Communicable Disease
Control (CDC) Department at the Ministry of
Health. This triggered an immediate response
from CDC, which started an investigation
and implemented a series of control
measures, including enhanced

In Egypt, event-based surveillance established
in 2015 with PC support is also proving
invaluable in helping authorities detect avian
influenza A(H5N1) quickly. The early warning
system uses a combination of formal and
informal channels to capture information
about events that are of potential risk to public
health. There is a community hotline, and a
media centre that scans news and social media
every day. The IHR national focal point acts as a
‘coordination mechanism’, linking reports and
feedback to other government departments, as
well as international organizations. The system
seems to be working: in 2016, Egypt reported
ten human cases of A(H5N1),
including four deaths.

Global networking
However good a country’s surveillance and preparedness plans are, collaboration – both before
and during an outbreak – improves the response. Enhancing connectivity and collaboration is
one of the PIP Framework’s goals, and across the world, PC funds support a range of initiatives to
improve sharing on national, regional and global scales (see Table 1).

Shipping support
When it comes to handling, storing and sharing influenza virus materials, the need to follow
strict national and international rules, regulations, and practices on biosafety and biosecurity is
important to protect laboratory staff, the public and the environment. But for several developing
countries, the capacity to properly prepare shipments of materials in accordance with
international shipping regulation is hampered by a lack of resources and training.
PC funds are helping these countries overcome the barriers by supporting two complementary
mechanisms managed through GIP:

which was established in 2005, provides
shipping services to NICs and other

Bridging knowledge gaps
Understanding of the burden of influenza is very patchy – especially
when it comes to the developing world, where morbidity and mortality data
have long been scant or absent. Today, thanks to recent growth in national
surveillance networks, that data gap is closing. But a knowledge gap
remains because many developing countries still lack both the tools and the
resources to carry out influenza burden estimates. In 2016, the PC supported
both global and national action to tackle the problem.
At a global level, the PC financed three activities:
1 A worldwide estimate of influenza-associated mortality, which started
in the first half of 2016 and is expected to deliver estimates at the end
of 2017.
2 A systematic literature review,12 which highlights the evidence available
on influenza burden and will be used to identify potential collaborators
and areas for future work.
3 An international consultation on influenza burden estimates, at which
93 researchers, from 32 countries, presented their efforts to generate
national estimates and were encouraged to record and share their
findings through scientific publications. To that end, in the second half of
2016, PC funds supported researchers to contribute to a theme issue of
the peer-reviewed Influenza and Other Respiratory Viruses journal. Articles
from more than 20 countries, including several developing ones, are
expected to be published in 2017.

20

At a national level, PC funds were
used to help Madagascar and
Senegal calculate their burden
of influenza; and to support six
countries (Chile, Colombia, Costa
Rica, Indonesia, Lao People’s
Democratic Republic, Romania)
test a newly-developed WHO
manual13 for estimating the disease’s
economic burden.
These estimates will help national
policy-makers weigh up the
costs and benefits of investing in
surveillance infrastructure and
supplies, such as influenza vaccines,
as well as other interventions such as
seasonal vaccination programmes.
But the data are also valuable in
informing the plans and practices
of donor agencies, multilateral
organisations and pharmaceutical
companies; and they will improve
the accuracy of global disease
burden estimates too.

12

The review covered three areas three subjects related to influenza burden (risk factors for severe outcomes following influenza disease in developing countries; seasonal
influenza mortality and morbidity; and the burden of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) compared with the burden of influenza in children). Results will be summarized and
published in 2017.

Shaping policy
and practice
Already, in some PIP priority countries,
the investment in estimating burden of influenza
is paying off – by helping national authorities decide
what to do and how.
In Cambodia, for example, the WHO manual has been used to inform
a hospital admission review at a SARI sentinel site in Svay Rieng
province that has helped deliver more reliable disease burden
estimates at a provincial level.
And in Viet Nam, a 2016 workshop on burden of
disease has paved the way to new data, informing
a range of activities to estimate the burden of
influenza in the country.

When a pandemic strikes, speed
is of the essence – affected
communities simply cannot afford
to have vaccines, diagnostics and
antivirals held up due to slow
regulatory approval. That is why
WHO, through the PC, is working to
help PIP priority countries benefit
from a common ‘fast track’ approval
processes for key influenza products.
Over the past year, PC funds
supported advocacy workshops
in the Eastern Mediterranean
region to promote the benefits of
strengthening regulatory systems
for accelerated approval, and raise
awareness of the options available
for doing so.

One of those options is for countries
to recognize the WHO Prequalification
(PQ) programme. This is the most
common approach: globally, nearly
two-thirds of National Regulatory
Authorities (NRAs) (61%) accept PQ
as the basis for approval of vaccine
products.
Another option is to use the WHO
collaborative procedure for accelerated
registration of WHO PQ products.14 Due
to PIP advocacy, this option is gaining
popularity among PIP priority countries
and 14 out of 48 countries have now
adopted the procedure.
Countries are also joining regional
regulatory harmonization efforts, such
as the African Medicines Regulatory
Harmonization (AMRH)15.

Planning

Streamlining the supply chain
During a pandemic, countries
without purchasing power or
production capacity rely on donations
to access pandemic products. But
these life-saving supplies will only
reach vulnerable countries and
communities if global supply chains
are clear, efficient and secure.

... supply chains must be able to come together
very quickly, with manufacturers, suppliers,
governments, civil society and commercial
transporters consolidating their efforts into a
common approach...

Perhaps most important, supply
chains must be able to come together
very quickly, with manufacturers,
suppliers, governments, civil society
and commercial transporters
consolidating their efforts into a
common approach that gets products
swiftly and smoothly from the
countries where they are produced
or stockpiled to the countries where
they are needed.
It’s not just at the global level that
supply chains need streamlining.
In-country supply chains must also
be ready and able to respond in an
emergency if vaccine delivery is not
to be delayed.

Simulations for
success
When it comes to systems testing,
online simulations are increasingly
the tool of choice for identifying
process gaps, highlighting skill
development needs and testing
how process concepts impact
results. Since 2014, PC funds
have been used to support the
development of a simulation tool
to test global deployment systems
by identifying the bottlenecks that
happen when multiple stakeholders
come together in a public health
emergency. The tool, known as
PIPDEPLOY, has been designed to
capture the time it takes to perform
key interactions in the supply chain,
identifying how often critical path
deadlines are missed and how often
significant change is introduced –
so that improvements can be made.
The building of PIPDEPLOY began in
2016, following a country feedback
survey the year before. Today, it
is in its final stages of technical
development, with the first live
simulation planned for 2017 (see
Figure 16). Even in its development
phases, PIPDEPLOY has attracted
the attention and participation of a
diverse range of stakeholders and
is already proving to be valuable
in strengthening a community of
practice around deployment.

Quantifying
gaps in
national plans
In 2009–2010, during the
A(H1N1) pandemic, countries
eligible for donated vaccines were
slow to achieve a “ready to deploy”
status; they were also slow to ask
for external support. PC funds
have been used to retrospectively
assess the 2009 national vaccine
deployment plans (NVDPs) of the
most vulnerable countries and
quantify the most common gaps
and identify the technical assistance
needed to accelerate readiness.
Results show that many 2009 plans
focused on mobilizing finance
rather than actual deployment
pandemic products and supplies.
For example, they did not cover
implementation details such
as deployment route mapping,
transport capacity by sub-national
zones, or intermediate storage
locations and related capacities.
In 2016, a second analysis of NVDPs
since 2010 suggests that capacity
development initiatives can help
deliver more detailed plans. The
analysis shows that those countries
that had engaged in such initiatives
displayed marked improvements in
the quality and depth of their plans.

Risk
communications
Helping countries provide effective public
health information during a pandemic
At all stages of a pandemic,
fast, effective and transparent
communication is needed: to give
lifesaving information to people
in affected areas; and to update
concerned citizens, decision
makers, health workers and donors
across the world on the unfolding
impacts and health response. As
such, risk communications has long
been a priority under the IHR.16 And
it has become even more important
with the explosion of real-time
information through social media.

Figure 18: PIP priority countries for risk communications work.

The positive influence of effective
risk communications during the
Ebola tragedy as well as recent
outbreaks of, for example, avian
influenza and yellow fever, has
convinced stakeholders that
communicating risk in health
emergencies is essential and
can have a serious impact on
the epidemic response. Risk
communications is now a core,
crosscutting element of pandemic
preparedness and response efforts,
within and outside of WHO.
Through the PC, WHO is working
with governments and partners to

Risk communication for One Health
Around three-quarters of emerging infectious diseases – including pandemic influenza –
are caused by pathogens that spread to people from animals or animal products.17 This makes
preparing, detecting and responding to an outbreak reliant on joint action across animal health,
human health and environmental health sectors. With PC support, WHO has joined forces with the
World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) to
strengthen skills, plans and real-time response across three sectors (see Figure 21).

Information for the front lines
People living in areas at high risk of a disease outbreak need good communications
to protect their own health, and take informed decisions that can safeguard themselves
and those around them. The PC funds activities at both national and international levels
to help citizens and communities prevent, prepare for, and respond to an emergency.
At a national level this includes
supporting context-specific
communication. For example, in
Cambodia, because poultry movement
increases during Chinese and Khmer
New Year (between February and April),
PIP funds were used to develop specific
messages for farmers and the public
during these months. In Mongolia, the
Ministry of Health and partners conduct
daily media and social media monitoring
and study public perceptions to identify
information gaps. They then use targeted
communications – including press
conferences, agency websites, media
interviews and social media – to fill
the gaps, correct misinformation and
manage rumours.

At an international level, PIP supports
www.OpenWHO.org – a new web-based
platform that provides interactive
courses and learning resources for
responders and decision makers on the
front lines of pandemic preparedness
and response.
OpenWHO will host all the PCfunded tools and resources for risk
communications – including an online
training course and a handbook, both
of which are available in four or more
languages. The tools are available at:
www.who.int/risk-communication/
training/en/.

LOOKING FORWARD
Planning the next stage of
PC-funded work

Across all five areas of work,
PC-funded activities are guided
by the outcomes, outputs and key
deliverables that were developed in
2013, and which are set out in the
high-level Partnership Contribution
Implementation Plan 2013–16
(HLIP I).18 Last year, the plan’s
lifespan was extended to the end
of 2017 to allow for activities to be
completed and evaluated, and to
make time to start working on the
next high-level implementation
plan, HLIP II.
The new plan, which will shape
PC activities to 2023, will build
on lessons learned from putting
HLIP I into practice. That includes
reflecting on the obstacles to
building capacity faced over the
past four years and harnessing WHO
staff and partners’ experience to
focus on tried and tested solutions.

34

The new implementation plan will
also reflect a changed landscape for
health emergencies, as well as the
results of two processes undertaken
in 2016:
1 A gaps and needs analysis19. The PIP
Secretariat completed an analysis
of preparedness gaps and needs,
and used it to consider the value
of the PC achievements to date
and to suggest future directions
of work.
2 An independent external
evaluation.20 , 21 An external team
was convened to independently
evaluate PC-funded activities.
For each area of work, the team
assessed progress towards HLIP I
outcomes and outputs, measured
impacts on preparedness, and
identified lessons learned to
inform the next implementation
plan.

WHO / WHE / IHM / PIP / 2017.01 Rev.1

There is no telling where
the next pandemic influenza virus
will emerge.
That means all countries – rich and poor, large and small – must be ready to respond when it does.
The Partnership Contribution (PC) to the WHO Pandemic Influenza Preparedness Framework works to support
developing countries where preparedness systems are weak, and to strengthen their capacities in five key areas:
laboratory and surveillance, burden of disease, regulatory capacity,
planning for deployment and risk communications.
	
This report shows that by building capacity where it is needed most, the PC is helping to ensure
the world is ready to respond when a crisis strikes. But the PC is also helping to secure the wider health security
of the countries it supports, because the capacity it helps develop improves a nation’s ability to prepare for other
infectious health threats too.
