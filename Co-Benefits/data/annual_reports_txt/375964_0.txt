Thomas Greminger, OSCE Secretary General, speaks at a meeting of the Permanent Council, Vienna, 31 August 2017. (OSCE/Benjamin Erasin)

Message from the
Secretary General

I have taken up the position of Secretary General at a time when our security environment is
increasingly complicated and unpredictable, and trust between OSCE participating States has
hit historic lows. At this critical juncture, the need for a regional security organization like the
OSCE has never been more apparent to prevent crises from turning into conflicts, to confront
transnational challenges, and to seize opportunities for co-operation.
Reinvigorating the OSCE as the most relevant forum for inclusive, results-oriented security
dialogue in Europe is one of my strategic priorities, along with strengthening and leveraging
partnerships, and ensuring that the Organization is fit for purpose. I intend to play a unifying
role, helping to build a positive agenda for the Organization. I will support participating States
in upholding OSCE principles and commitments, and work with them to build on common
ground where interests coincide.
They already co-operate effectively to combat transnational threats like terrorism, violent
extremism, and trafficking in drugs, arms and people. Common efforts to create confidencebuilding measures to prevent crises stemming from cyber/ICT security threats, for which
the Ministerial Council reiterated its support in Hamburg, show the value of an incremental
approach to building mutual confidence.
The Structured Dialogue, launched at the 2016 Hamburg Ministerial Council, developed over
the course of 2017 into a useful platform for constructive engagement in the politico-military
dimension. Eventually, this informal process should produce results, including military risk
reduction measures and confidence- and security-building measures. Further down the road, I
hope this leads to renewed focus on conventional arms control.

OSCE ANNUAL REPORT 2017

-----------------------Page 6 End-----------------------

Economic connectivity and environmental co-operation are also areas with unifying potential
and where the OSCE builds trust and adds value in line with the Sustainable Development
Agenda. I am hopeful that as our participating States make progress through co-operation in
the first and second dimensions, they will also come together to reaffirm and strengthen our
shared commitments to human rights, fundamental freedoms and the rule of law.
Working toward a sustainable resolution of the crisis in and around Ukraine remains the
Organization’s top priority. In 2017, the OSCE steadfastly continued its efforts to de-escalate
tensions on the ground and facilitate the political discussions aimed at achieving a peaceful
settlement. The year was marked by continued, at times intense, military activity and a
worsening humanitarian situation in eastern Ukraine, and the risk of escalation remains high.
The international community must push harder to break the political stalemate and achieve full
implementation of the Minsk Agreements by all sides. After almost four years of fighting, the
people in the conflict zone deserve a return to peace and stability, and the chance to rebuild
their lives. The tragic death in the line of duty of one of our colleagues in the Special Monitoring
Mission to Ukraine in April 2017 highlighted the dangers to which OSCE Mission members are
exposed. We are continuously adapting our security posture to mitigate risks to our monitors,
but we also depend on an enabling environment to do our work. The sides to the conflict need
to fulfil their obligation to guarantee the safety of OSCE monitors, and to grant them full and
unhindered access throughout the conflict zone.
The OSCE continued its co-chairmanship of the Geneva International Discussions and its cofacilitation of the Incident Prevention and Response Mechanism meetings in Ergneti, which aim
to address security and humanitarian challenges on the ground.
Peaceful, durable solutions to the crisis in and around Ukraine and the protracted conflicts
in the OSCE region ultimately depend on the political will of the parties to the conflicts. In
the Transdniestrian settlement process, the recent agreement on concrete steps between
Chisinau and Tiraspol shows that progress is possible even after many years of deadlock. I
hope this positive dynamic will give new momentum to the settlement process, and inspire
greater will among the parties to resolve other conflicts in the OSCE region.
The OSCE is well equipped to respond to crises, but we should also be ready to make
the most of openings for co-operation. In 2017, we not only witnessed progress in the
Transdniestrian settlement process, but also a new, co-operative spirit in Central Asia,
transformations in South-Eastern Europe, and broad recognition of the need for co-operation
on shared security concerns in the Mediterranean. The OSCE can and should respond to
these positive developments in a meaningful way, including by leveraging our Partnerships for
Co-operation and our relations with other international and regional organizations, above all
the United Nations. Several countries hosting OSCE field operations want to work more closely
with the Organization, and others are looking for new forms of co-operation in the field. My side
event at the Vienna Ministerial Council on field operations as a tool for co-operation highlighted
the need for flexibility and tailoring our work to host country priorities; it also paved the way for
deeper reflection on how to enhance the OSCE’s added value on the ground.
To successfully meet the many complex challenges facing our region, we need to make sure
that our Organization is up to the task. I am fully committed to this goal and ready to work
together with the participating States to enhance the OSCE’s role as a valuable platform for
inclusive dialogue and joint action. I believe that the OSCE is a space where, together, we can
make real progress in reconciling differences and tackling challenges to common security
across our region and beyond.
The 2017 Austrian OSCE Chairmanship steered the OSCE through difficult times and I am
grateful for the strong support that Austria has traditionally extended to the Organization.
I would also like to express my sincere appreciation for the professionalism, commitment
and hard work of all the women and men who work in the Secretariat, institutions and field
operations. Last but not least, I would like to acknowledge the tremendous contribution of my
distinguished predecessor, Lamberto Zannier, now OSCE High Commissioner on National
Minorities, whose dedicated work is reflected throughout this report.

Austria’s priorities: defusing existing conflicts,
addressing radicalization and violent extremism,
re-establishing trust and confidence

www.osce.org/chairmanship

Austria assumed the Chairmanship of the OSCE during a critical phase, when the
participating States were facing a multitude of serious challenges to peace and security,
including armed conflicts and crises, violent extremism and radicalization that lead to
terrorism and an increasing lack of trust between states. Moreover, violations of the OSCE’s
principles and values in recent years and a failure to implement agreements in good faith
have damaged relations among the participating States.
Convinced that the OSCE plays an important part in addressing these complex challenges
and restoring trust, the Austrian OSCE Chairmanship focused its efforts on fostering open
and constructive dialogue and on searching for practical and effective common solutions.

(OSCE/Micky Kroell)

“Given the challenges the OSCE participating States are facing, a strong OSCE as a real
platform for dialogue and co-operation is more necessary than ever. But this requires political
will. Only the full engagement and ownership of all 57 participating States will enable
sustainable progress and contribute to meeting the expectations of their populations.”

DEFUSING CONFLICTS
In 2017, conflicts continued to cause much suffering,
displacement and destruction in parts of the OSCE region,
resulting in heavy impact on the affected communities.
The crisis in and around Ukraine remained the greatest
source of instability in the OSCE region and caused an
alarming humanitarian situation on the ground, putting it at
the top of the Chairmanship’s priority list.
The Chairmanship facilitated the agreement on a
timely renewal of the mandate of the OSCE Special
Monitoring Mission to Ukraine (SMM) and the Observer
Mission at the Russian Checkpoints Gukovo and
Donetsk, including the important decision to strengthen

boundary lines, led to tangible benefits for conflictaffected communities.
The OSCE’s response to the political crisis in the
former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia in April, under
the guidance and with the active involvement of the
Chairmanship, demonstrated the Organization’s ability
to react quickly and effectively to critical situations and
to contribute in a comprehensive and co-ordinated
manner to defusing tensions and bringing underlying
challenges to resolution.
FIGHTING RADICALIZATION AND VIOLENT
EXTREMISM
Recognizing the significant threat posed to all participating
States by violent extremism and radicalization that lead
to terrorism (VERLT), the Chairmanship over the course
of 2016 and 2017 organized five regional workshops in
South-Eastern Europe, Central Asia, the Mediterranean
and the Black Sea regions as well as Western Europe with
young experts, brought together more than 500 experts
for a major counter-terrorism conference in May, and
engaged foreign ministers from across the OSCE area
on this issue. The Chairmanship’s Special Representative
on Countering Radicalization and Violent Extremism
prepared recommendations and a compilation of bestpractice models to assist states in effectively combating
this phenomenon and making better use of the OSCE as
a networking hub. Austria provided €250,000 to support
continued work of the OSCE and the development of a
handbook on countering violent radicalization.

the SMM through a substantial increase in the budget

The Chairmanship focused on enabling political
solutions to existing crises and conflicts, while
emphasizing the need to do more to help the local
populations that are suffering the most. The 24/7

REBUILDING TRUST
The Chairmanship focused on fostering open and
constructive dialogue, addressing disagreements and
differing perceptions, and making efforts to find compromise
solutions and improve trust amongst the participating States.
Based on the mandate provided by the Hamburg
Declaration, the Austrian Chairmanship launched the
Structured Dialogue on the current and future security
challenges in the OSCE area, which aims to overcome
the climate of confrontation. The Chairmanship organized
a series of interactive meetings with participating States,
with the goal of fostering understanding and identifying
common ground to reverse the negative trends in the
arms control architecture and to revitalize co-operative
security in Europe. The meetings focused on the topics of
threat perceptions, security concerns, challenges to the
European rules-based security order and the role of military
communication in de-escalation and risk reduction. The
Chairmanship also initiated an in-depth analysis of force
postures and military exercises. This process will continue
in 2018.
Additionally, Austria focused on topics such as cyber/ICT
security, economic connectivity and green economies.
Progress made in these areas aims to generate more trust
and confidence, and to act as a catalyst for further joint
work. Chairmanship events throughout the year brought
together high-level officials from participating States,
businesses and communities to discuss ways to strengthen
good governance, increase economic participation and
improve environmental co-operation and risk reduction.

institutions and field operations, and overcame numerous
political obstacles in an effort to ensure that the Organization
has the necessary means to carry out its mandate. It
brokered agreement on a budget for 2017 and built
consensus on the appointment of the new leadership of the
OSCE and its institutions. In addition, Austria engaged with
OSCE field operations and their respective host countries
to ensure ownership in the missions’ work – focusing on
impact and results in support of agreed reform priorities.

The human dimension of security remained at the core of
the OSCE’s work in 2017. Despite divergent perceptions
and priorities, the Chairmanship was able to bring together
participating States and civil society to discuss key issues
such as freedom of the media, freedom of religion or belief,
tolerance and non-discrimination, gender equality and
access to justice. The Chairmanship advocated a consistent
human rights “mainstreaming” within the OSCE, across all of
the activities and the three dimensions of the Organization,
most notably in the fight against terrorism and VERLT.
The Chairmanship invested considerable effort into restoring
trust in the OSCE to optimize its functionality and credibility
for overcoming the challenges and security risks the OSCE
participating States are facing. The Chairmanship promoted
the use of the OSCE and its instruments, in particular the

OSCE foreign ministers and heads of delegations at the 24th Ministerial Council in Vienna, 7 December 2017. (BMEIA/Georges Schneider)

24TH MINISTERIAL COUNCIL
8–9 DECEMBER 2017, VIENNA, AUSTRIA
The Vienna Ministerial Council meeting was the culmination
of Austrian efforts to provide an impulse to renew the
OSCE’s collective commitment to work together to tackle
common threats and challenges, and to reaffirm the
importance of a rules-based security order in Europe. The
Ministerial Council continued the emphasis on genuine
dialogue that had started at the informal ministerial meeting
in Mauerbach in July 2017.
Over the course of two days, discussions among the
foreign ministers were held in a variety of formats, both
formal and informal, and at varying levels. Many ministers
used the opportunity for bilateral meetings, for example
Foreign Minister of the Russian Federation Sergey Lavrov
and Secretary of State of the United States of America Rex
Tillerson. A series of 16 side events allowed ministers to
exchange views on a range of key issues, including on the
humanitarian situation in eastern Ukraine, the Structured
Dialogue and VERLT. Most of these events were accessible
to civil society representatives, media and youth. Other
events focused on relations with the OSCE’s Mediterranean
and Asian Partners for Co-operation and on a possible UN
peacekeeping operation in eastern Ukraine.
Foreign ministers adopted 11 decisions and declarations in
Vienna. They agreed to enhance OSCE efforts to reduce
the risks of conflict stemming from the use of information
and communication technologies, and to reinforce and
expand efforts to lessen the threat posed by small arms and
light weapons and stockpiles of conventional ammunition.
Decisions were also adopted to strengthen activities to
prevent trafficking in human beings, and to combat all forms
of child trafficking, including for sexual exploitation. With
the adoption of a decision on economic participation in the
OSCE area, ministers agreed on wide-ranging measures
to intensify co-operation on economic activities, promote
good governance, and further enhance efforts to encourage
employment opportunities for women and young people as
one means to reduce the risk of radicalization. Referring to
the positive developments in the Transdniestrian settlement
process, the participating States adopted a statement
welcoming the concrete confidence-building measures
agreed by the Sides and called on them to continue to
10

work towards further tangible progress. Furthermore they
confirmed the appointments of the new leadership of the
Organization, indispensable for a well-functioning OSCE.
In addition, the 2017 OSCE Chairmanship Troika (Germany,
Austria, Italy), together with Slovakia as the incoming Troika
member, highlighted its concern about deepened mistrust,
increased tensions, and conflict and instability within and
between OSCE participating States.
The OSCE Troika also called for the implementation of
a durable and verifiable ceasefire and a new impetus to
intensify efforts to resolve the crisis in and around Ukraine.
Finally, Austria issued Chairmanship declarations on
greening the economy and fostering environmental
co-operation, together with the Kazakh Chair of the
Economic and Environmental Committee, and on
preventing and countering terrorism and VERLT.

TRILATERAL CONTACT GROUP
AMBASSADOR MARTIN SAJDIK
Special Representative of the Chairpersonin-Office in Ukraine and in the Trilateral
Contact Group
The Trilateral Contact Group (TCG), which
includes the OSCE, Ukraine and Russia as well
as agreed participants from certain areas of
the Donetsk and Luhansk regions – the only
forum where the conflict sides meet on issues of
common concern – followed an active pattern of
meetings throughout the year. It discussed issues
of essential importance for the civilian population
in Donbas, ranging from the ceasefire and water
supplies to improving conditions for crossing
the line of contact. Regarding humanitarian
issues, the TCG devoted consistent attention to
the preparation of a release and an exchange
of persons detained in relation to the conflict. It
put in place an attestation mechanism to verify
which of the detainees were willing to participate
in such an exchange. The exercise involved the
Ukrainian Ombudsperson and civilian participants
from certain areas of the Donetsk and Luhansk

regions of Ukraine. It was acknowledged as a
success by all sides. By agreeing an ad hoc
payment mechanism, the TCG also succeeded
in renewing and stabilizing the supply of water to
the entire population residing in the part of the
Luhansk region that is outside the control of the
Ukrainian government. Thanks to a substantial
decrease in military activity after the conflict
sides re-committed to the “harvest ceasefire” in
June 2017 and the “back-to-school ceasefire” in
August 2017, the number of civilian victims steadily
declined. In the August-October period, their
number dropped fourfold compared to the MayJuly period. Although in November and December
the violence along the contact line increased,
following a renewed commitment to a sustainable
and comprehensive ceasefire by the sides at the
TCG meeting of 20 December, ceasefire violations
decreased again.

Throughout 2017, Ambassador Kasprzyk and his team
conducted monitoring exercises, providing a continuous
review of the situation on the ground related to the
Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. The Office played an active
role in assisting the Chairperson-in-Office and the co-chairs
of the Minsk Group (MG) in advancing the peace process,
responding quickly to any outbreaks of violence and
informing about developments on the ground.
Ambassador Kasprzyk continued to look for opportunities
to promote further confidence-building measures with the
consent of the sides. At the request of the sides, the Office
supported a number of ad hoc humanitarian operations
during the year including negotiations to return human
remains, supporting a search and retrieval operation to
recover the bodies of killed servicemen from minefields
in no-man’s land, and visits to villages affected by civilian
casualties.
With the support of the sides, Ambassador Kasprzyk and
his team conducted 24 monitoring exercises, six on the
Armenian-Azerbaijani border and 18 on the Line of Contact.
These activities also enabled representatives of the HighLevel Planning Group to visit the region four times.
The Office continuously informed the Chairmanship and MG
co-chairs about all aspects of the situation on the ground
as well as about activities and key events having an impact
on the negotiations. It provided logistical support for the
three visits by the MG co-chairs to the region. Ambassador
Kasprzyk assisted the co-chairs in organizing a presidential
summit and five meetings at the level of foreign ministers
throughout the year.

“Integration of a gender perspective into planning was an area

to the Permanent Council on 9 November 2017.
A closer co-operation with the OSCE Secretariat, including the
Conflict Prevention Centre, the Gender Section, Legal Services
and the Office of the Special Representative and
Co-ordinator for Combating Trafficking in Human Beings, as
well as the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine and
the United Nations Global Service Centre fed significantly into
the High-Level Planning Group’s efforts to review and update
its planning options for a possible peacekeeping operation for
the area of conflict dealt with by the OSCE Minsk Conference.

The situation related to the aftermath of the 2008 war
in Georgia remained relatively calm and stable, in spite
of increased military activities noticed in the region.
Together with his fellow co-chairs from the EU and the
UN, Ambassador Bächler co-chaired four rounds of the
Geneva International Discussions (GID). The participants
came close to agreeing on a joint declaration on the nonuse of force and remained committed to addressing security
and humanitarian issues in this format. The GID and its
associated Incident Prevention and Response Mechanisms
(IPRM) remain the only platforms for defusing potential
tensions that are accepted by all participants. Together
with the Head of the EU Monitoring Mission in Georgia,
Ambassador Bächler co-facilitated 11 meetings of the IPRM
in Ergneti. These meetings continued to be an important
tool for constructive dialogue between the participants
and contributed to solving concrete issues around the
administrative boundary line.

As was underscored during the visit of the OSCE
Chairperson-in-Office to Chisinau and Tiraspol in early
2017, the Chairmanship remained committed to the resultsoriented 5+2 process stipulated in the 2016 OSCE Ministerial
Statement adopted in Hamburg. Ambassador Wolf Dietrich
Heim encouraged the Sides to focus on the core issues and
to use the expert working groups to find technical solutions.
This approach culminated in the groundbreaking decision by
the Sides on 3 November to open the bridge at Gura BiculuiBychok for civilian traffic, which represented substantial
progress on the issue of freedom of movement for people,
goods and services. Furthermore, the opening of this bridge
on 18 November made it possible to hold a formal meeting
in the 5+2 negotiation format on 27 and 28 November
in Vienna. With additional agreements on other issues –
including those part of the Berlin Protocol – the Austrian
Chairmanship succeeded in establishing a new active rhythm
in the negotiation process.

Having in mind the impact of the situation on the local
population, the Chairperson-in-Office visited a camp
for internally displaced persons and addressed the
participants of an IPRM meeting in Ergneti. He underlined
the Chairmanship’s overall commitment to prioritize efforts
to resolve conflicts and strengthen dialogue and confidencebuilding measures.

COUNTERING VIOLENT EXTREMISM
AND RADICALIZATION THAT LEAD
TO TERRORISM
PROFESSOR PETER NEUMANN
Special Representative of the Chairperson-in-Office on
the Countering Radicalization and Violent Extremism
Professor Neumann’s aim was to sharpen the OSCE’s
focus on countering violent extremism and radicalization
that lead to terrorism (VERLT). In addition to engaging with
the OSCE executive structures, Professor Neumann visited
many of the OSCE participating States in Western Europe,
South-Eastern Europe and Central Asia, as well as the
Russian Federation, the United States of America and the
European institutions. This enabled him to identify the best
practices and recommendations that were compiled in his
final report. He also contributed his expertise to the OSCEwide counter-terrorism conference, the Annual Security
Review Conference, the informal foreign ministers meeting
and several workshops throughout the year.

The report Professor Neumann presented to the
participating States made a number of practical
recommendations. These included establishing a hub
for the exchange of best practices and capitalizing on
the OSCE’s local presence in strategically important
regions such as South-Eastern Europe and Central Asia.
Implementing these proposals will strengthen the OSCE’s
capability to make an effective contribution to countering
VERLT.

PROMOTING GENDER EQUALITY
AMBASSADOR
MELANNE VERVEER
Special Representative
of the OSCE
Chairperson-in-Office
on Gender Issues

Ambassador Verveer undertook several initiatives to
advance gender mainstreaming in the OSCE. At the
Gender Equality Review Conference, she put emphasis
on issues critical to advancing progress for women across
the three dimensions of the OSCE’s mandate. At a highlevel mediation retreat in April, she underscored the
necessity of women’s participation across the conflict
cycle. Ambassador Verveer made a country visit to
Ukraine, where she focused, among other issues, on
gender-based violence, the implementation of Ukraine’s
national action plan on women, peace and security, and
the role of women in the SMM. She presented her findings
to the Permanent Council, offering recommendations on
mainstreaming gender across the work of the OSCE. She
further emphasized that the OSCE, as the largest regional
security organization, can and must take the lead in this
regard. In September, Ambassador Verveer delivered the
keynote address at the ODIHR conference on the human
dimension of security in Ukraine.

ASSISTANCE WITH BILATERAL
AGREEMENTS
HELMUT NAPIONTEK
Representative to the RussianLatvian Joint Commission on
Military Pensioners

The Representative continued to assist in the implementation
of the 1994 bilateral agreement between the governments
of Latvia and the Russian Federation on social guarantees
for military pensioners from the Russian Federation and
their families residing in Latvia. The latest available overview
registers 7,701 people falling under the special provisions
of the bilateral agreement. There were no new fundamental
issues concerning the work of the Commission in the past
year. As a stable trend since 2008, no individual complaints
were brought to the attention of the Commission by military
pensioners in 2017. As it is impossible to rule out such
complaints in the future, the 2017 report to the Permanent
Council concluded that the function of a Representative
should continue to exist as a stand-by arrangement.

enhance the legal status of the OSCE through domestic
legislation and/or through bilateral agreements with the
OSCE, as well as by concluding an agreement on the legal
status, privileges and immunities of the OSCE between
interested participating States outside of the OSCE’s
framework. An extended meeting of the informal working
group in July 2017 allowed for intensified discussions
amongst delegations and with legal experts, and provided
valuable insight on the practical implications for field
operations, also with regard to the duty of care.

YOUTH AND SECURITY

The Special Representatives of the Chairperson-in-Office
on Youth and Security, Anna-Katharina Deininger, Asif
Safdary, Nico Schernbeck, Matteo Pugliese and Mehmed
Alajbegović, dedicated their work to strengthening the
voice of young people and increasing meaningful youth
participation and structural youth mainstreaming within the
OSCE. They advised the Chairmanship on youth issues;
voiced the views of young people at OSCE events on
issues such as preventing and countering radicalization and
terrorism, migration, human rights, political participation
and cybersecurity; and championed the concerns of young
people in the OSCE region.

LEGAL FRAMEWORK

The legal status of the OSCE continued to be a focus of
the OSCE under the Austrian Chairmanship in 2017. A
Headquarters Agreement between Austria and the OSCE
was signed in June 2017, a clear recognition by Austria
that it considers the OSCE as enjoying international legal
personality on the basis of customary international law.
Special Advisor Ambassador Helmut Tichy chaired three
meetings of the informal working group on strengthening
the legal framework of the OSCE. Short of a solution that
would grant international legal personality in accordance
with one of the four options discussed in the informal
working group, the participating States explored ways to

PARTNERS FOR CO-OPERATION
The Austrian Chairmanship promoted the involvement of the Asian and Mediterranean Partners for Co-operation in OSCE
events and activities, ensuring continued dialogue between the OSCE and its Partners.

ASIAN CONTACT GROUP
Asian Partners for Co-operation: Afghanistan, Australia, Japan, Republic of Korea, Thailand
Chair: Germany

Speakers at the 2017 OSCE Asian Conference, Berlin, 19 June 2017. (Federal Foreign Office of Germany)

In close consultation with the five OSCE Asian Partners
and the Secretariat and based on recommendations from
annual reports by previous Chairmanships and Ministerial
Council Troika meetings, Germany set out a crossdimensional work plan for 2017 which also reflected
priorities of the Austrian OSCE Chair. Supporting a
demand-driven approach and responding to the interests
and priorities of the Asian Partners, Germany focused on
deepening and operationalizing the dialogue and
co-operation with the Asian Partners. The Contact Group
continued exchanging experiences and lessons learned
on issues of mutual concern, in particular common
security challenges in the OSCE and Asia-Pacific regions.

High-level representatives from Partner countries and
OSCE participating States as well as international
organizations, renowned academics and experts from
the OSCE Secretariat initiated fruitful discussions and
exchanged best practices.

The Contact Group met five times in 2017 and discussed
in particular the following topics:

The 2017 OSCE Asian Conference, focusing on
common challenges and common opportunities, took
place in Berlin, Germany, on 19 and 20 June, with the
participation of several deputy foreign ministers and other
high-level representatives. The event’s three thematic
sessions and the side event, reflecting the OSCE’s
three dimensions, provided a timely opportunity for
OSCE participating States and Asian Partners to share
views and experiences on topics of particular interest
to the participating States and the Asian Partners,
including confidence-building, connectivity and regional
economic co-operation, the region’s contribution to
the UN Sustainable Development Goals and how to
further engage with Afghanistan and its neighbours on
empowering women.

Germany also promoted practical co-operation and
contributed to the OSCE Partnership Fund to allow
representatives of the OSCE Partners to take part in
OSCE activities and events, as well as to finance the
OSCE’s “Young Diplomats” extrabudgetary project.

MEDITERRANEAN CONTACT GROUP
Mediterranean Partners for Co-operation: Algeria, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Morocco, Tunisia
Chair: Italy

Asma Mansour, President and Co-Founder of the Tunisian Centre for Social Entrepreneurship, speaks at
a meeting of the OSCE Mediterranean Contact Group, Vienna, 25 September 2017. (OSCE/LCarmona)

The 2017 Italian Chairmanship of the Mediterranean
Contact Group focused primarily on the common ground
rather than the differences that may exist between the
OSCE region and the OSCE’s Mediterranean Partners
by developing a “positive agenda”. Building upon efforts
undertaken by previous Chairmanships, Italy worked
on finding areas of co-operation with the Mediterranean
Partners through an inclusive and tangible approach.
In 2017, the Mediterranean Contact Group meetings were
devoted to topics such as:
 combating trafficking in cultural property and its
implications for security and stability in the OSCE region;
 promoting dialogue between the OSCE and its
Partners for Co-operation with a view to reducing risks
of conflict stemming from the use of information and
communication technologies;
 energy security in times of economic and political
uncertainty – thinking green when looking at the future
of the Mediterranean;
 women, peace and security: increasing political
participation of women and the role of women in
prevention and mediation processes as a factor of
positive change in the Mediterranean;
 economic development as a way to address the root
causes of instability: the role of small and medium
enterprises; and
 building the “Mediterranean of the future” by fostering
dialogue between think tanks and policy planners from
the two shores.

CHAIRMANSHIP

The Italian Chair, together with the OSCE Secretariat,
established and funded a number of extrabudgetary
projects as follow-up to discussions, such as the
workshops Combating Illicit Cross-border Trafficking in
Cultural Property in the Mediterranean and Understanding
Mediation Within the Framework of Women, Peace and
Security, and the launch of the OSCE GEMS Award, which
will award young green and social entrepreneurs from the
six Mediterranean Partners with educational grants.

2017 OSCE MEDITERRANEAN
CONFERENCE
The annual Mediterranean Conference took place on 24 and
25 October in Palermo, Italy, and was devoted to challenges
and opportunities of large movements of migrants and
refugees in the Mediterranean. The event attracted a large
turnout, with 71 delegations and organizations taking part,
including a delegation from Libya invited as a guest of the
Italian Chair. The conference put an emphasis on issues
affecting Mediterranean security, including drug trafficking,
organized crime, smuggling and trafficking in human beings. It
also focused on the economic and social potential of migration
and the role of integration policies for inclusive growth,
sustainable development, peace and stability. Participants
engaged in an open dialogue; their debate highlighted how
emergencies and crises, if dealt with in a spirit of responsibility
and solidarity, can be turned into opportunities for renewed
regional and international co-operation.

Council

www.osce.org/permanent-council

During the 2017 Austrian OSCE Chairmanship, the
weekly meetings of the Permanent Council were chaired
by Austria’s Permanent Representative to the OSCE,
Ambassador Clemens Koja.
Throughout the year, Ambassador Koja welcomed
distinguished guest speakers to the Permanent Council,
including ministers and deputy ministers from the
participating States and high-level representatives from
international organizations. Guest speakers highlighted
issues of special relevance to the Chairmanship, such
as the humanitarian situation in the conflict zone in
eastern Ukraine, countering radicalization, protection of
journalists and the fight against corruption.
Besides the work of the OSCE institutions and field
operations, in view of unresolved conflict and crisis
situations in the OSCE area, various conflict settlement
efforts played an important part in many of the 39
sessions of the Permanent Council in 2017. On the crisis
in and around Ukraine alone, Special Representative
of the Chairperson-in-Office in Ukraine and in the
Trilateral Contact Group, Ambassador Martin Sajdik,
and Chief Monitor of the SMM, Ambassador Ertuğrul
Apakan, briefed the Permanent Council six times. The
Chairperson also called special meetings following the
escalation of violence in eastern Ukraine and the death
of an SMM team member.
The meetings of the Permanent Council provided
an opportunity to foster close, mutually beneficial
co-operation with other international organizations
active in the OSCE area through participation of highlevel representatives of the CoE, the UNHCR, the
ICRC, the International Anti-Corruption Academy, the
EU, the Organization for Democracy and Economic
Development, GUAM, and the Eurasian Economic
Commission.

Forum for
Security
Co-operation

FSC Chairmanships – Romania, the Russian Federation and Serbia

www.osce.org/forum-for-security-cooperation

Discussions on the crisis in and around Ukraine continued to be the dominant topic at the
weekly sessions of the Forum for Security Co-operation (FSC). Throughout the year, the
Forum addressed key issues and developments related to the politico-military dimension,
including arms control and CSBMs, the Code of Conduct on Politico-Military Aspects of
Security, small arms and light weapons (SALW) and stockpiles of conventional ammunition
(SCA), as well as subregional military and defence co-operation. The Forum adopted
seven decisions designed to support the implementation of existing commitments. The
substantial work of the FSC was crowned by the adoption of the decision on SALW and
SCA at the Vienna Ministerial Council.

A PLATFORM FOR DIALOGUE
The FSC continues to provide valuable opportunities for
dialogue and discussion on the most pressing militaryrelated security issues in the OSCE region as well as
on its political and military commitments. The three
successive 2017 FSC Chairmanships – Romania, the
Russian Federation and Serbia – invested considerable
effort in strengthening the OSCE’s focus on politico-military
security by maximizing the use of the FSC as a forum for
negotiations and consultations on military security and
stability in the OSCE area. A total of 19 so-called
Security Dialogues with guest speakers were devoted
to matters related to topical European security issues,
including CSBMs, the Code of Conduct on PoliticoMilitary Aspects of Security, SALW and SCA, UN Security
Council resolutions 1540 (2004) and 1325 (2000), as well

as subregional military and defence co-operation. Some
innovative topics were also discussed, including the role
of military chaplains in the armed forces and freedom
of belief in peacetime or at war, the role of parliaments
in the democratic control of armed forces, and bilateral
agreements on the prevention of military incidents.
All three FSC Chairmanships co-operated closely with
the Austrian OSCE Chairmanship and the Permanent
Council on cross-dimensional issues of relevance
to both bodies in line with the OSCE’s concept of
comprehensive and indivisible security. To this end, four
joint meetings were held: one on military aspects of
cybersecurity, two on the Structured Dialogue, and one
on support to the national authorities in the migration
crisis by the security forces.

-----------------------Page 27 End-----------------------

The 27th Annual Implementation Assessment
Meeting in February-March provided an opportunity
for the OSCE participating States to discuss the
current and future implementation of agreed
CSBMs. In accordance with its mandate, the
FSC contributed to the Annual Security Review
Conference held in June, focusing on politicomilitary aspects of security. The Sixth annual
discussion on the implementation of the OSCE
Code of Conduct on Politico-Military Aspects of
Security was also held in Vienna in June. A further
conference on the Code of Conduct in Washington,
D.C. in October, the first such conference in the
United States, provided a unique opportunity to
discuss the implementation and promote awareness
of the provisions of the Code in the North American
context and to support outreach in its regard. The
Heads of Verification Centres met in December to
exchange experiences and information on technical
aspects of the Vienna Document 2011.
Significant work was accomplished in the area
of SALW and SCA: A meeting on deactivation
of SALW was held in March, which resulted in
enhancing the process of developing minimal
standards for the deactivation of SALW.
Furthermore, an online reporting tool was
introduced to allow the participating States to
simultaneously submit national SALW reports
to both the OSCE and the UN, contributing to
transparency, predictability and stability. This
helped lessen the reporting burden on the
participating States. In October, the FSC organized
a special meeting to review the implementation of
OSCE assistance projects in the field of SALW and
SCA, and to discuss various aspects of project
management issues. The efficient work on this
topic stimulated the participating States to adopt
the Decision on SALW and SCA at the Vienna
Ministerial Council in December.

FSC PARTNER ORGANIZATIONS AND
INSTITUTIONS IN 2017
The FSC worked with the following
international organizations and partners:
United Nations (UN), UN Institute for Disarmament
Research (UNIDIR), UN Office for Disarmament Affairs
(UNODA), Black Sea Trust for Regional Cooperation
(BSTRC), Centre for Security Cooperation (RACVIAC),

The OSCE Parliamentary Assembly (PA) deepened its focus in 2017 on issues such
as migration, cybersecurity, terrorism and gender aspects of security. A new Ad Hoc
Committee on Countering Terrorism was established at the Annual Session in Minsk,
and the Assembly continued to develop its relations with partners, holding meetings with
officials from the United Nations, the European Union, the International Criminal Court and
the Commonwealth of Independent States, among others. Election observation remained
a central focus of OSCE PA activities, with elections observed in five countries, including
the PA’s first-ever missions to Germany and Mongolia. Austrian parliamentarian Christine
Muttonen was re-elected Assembly President at the Minsk Annual Session. Georgian
parliamentarian George Tsereteli succeeded her in November.

PARLIAMENTARY DIPLOMACY
The PA conducted high-level diplomacy throughout the
OSCE area, including North America, the South Caucasus,
North Africa and Central Asia. President Muttonen visited
OSCE participating States, including Belarus, Canada,
Kazakhstan, the United States of America and Uzbekistan.
She also visited the OSCE Partner for Co-operation
Morocco for talks centring on Mediterranean engagement
and counter-terrorism, as well as China, where she met
with representatives of the Chinese Foreign Ministry and
the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation. In March, together
with the Austrian Parliament, the PA organized a major
conference, OSCE Security Policy – Female Perspectives,
with broad participation of parliamentarians from many
participating States.

OSCE PA Special Representatives Roberto Battelli (MP,
Slovenia) and Kristian Vigenin (MP, Bulgaria) conducted
regional visits to South-Eastern Europe and the South
Caucasus, holding high-level meetings in Albania, Armenia,

co-organized with the IOM, was held in Prague. It provided
an opportunity for OSCE field operations to network and
exchange views.
WATER MANAGEMENT
The OSCE continued its long-standing engagement in the
Dniester River basin by supporting the negotiation, signing
and ratification of the Dniester River Basin Treaty between
Moldova and Ukraine. The Treaty, a modern framework
for transboundary water co-operation and sustainable
development, entered into force in July 2017. To support
its implementation, the OCEEA started a new Global
Environment Facility-funded project with the OSCE field
operations, the UNDP and the UNECE.
The Office also carried out activities to connect water
experts from Central Asia and Afghanistan, with a focus
on academics, women and youth. In the South Caucasus,
technical consultations for a draft framework agreement
between Azerbaijan and Georgia on the Kura River basin
were finalized in preparation for initiating official negotiations
between the two countries.

ENERGY SECURITY AND RENEWABLE
ENERGY PROMOTION

The OCEEA continued to support the OSCE
participating States in building capacity in
renewable energy and energy efficiency.
This included organizing a workshop in
Astana, Kazakhstan, on green building
standards in September and a visit by
Turkmenistan energy experts to Austria, as
well as assisting Turkmenistan in developing
a strategic roadmap for solar energy.

CLIMATE CHANGE AND SECURITY
An OSCE-led project on climate change and security in
Eastern Europe, Central Asia and the South Caucasus
was successfully completed in the summer of 2017 under
the Environment and Security (ENVSEC) Initiative, with
the support of the EU and the Austrian Development
Cooperation. Key project results were climate change and
security assessments for each region, a transboundary
adaptation strategy for the Dniester River basin, and
increased awareness and capacity to assess potential
security risks stemming from climate change. The OCEEA
initiated preparations for a follow-up project that will also
aim at engaging countries from South-Eastern Europe.
DISASTER RISK REDUCTION
The OCEEA continued to support community-based
activities in the field of disaster risk reduction. The project
Disaster Risk Reduction and Security in the OSCE Area
was implemented in selected countries in South-Eastern
Europe and Central Asia. As part of the project, the
OCEEA organized local training courses, and supported
the development of local disaster risk reduction plans and
co-operation among neighbouring, cross-border local
administrations.

GOOD ENVIRONMENTAL GOVERNANCE
In 2017, the network of 60 OSCE-supported Aarhus
Centres in 14 OSCE participating States celebrated its
15th anniversary. These centres provide platforms where
citizens, governments and the private sector can engage in
dialogue on environmental challenges. At the Sixth Session
of the Meeting of the Parties to the Aarhus Convention,
held in Budva, Montenegro, the members of the network
discussed their contribution to implementing the 2030
Agenda for Sustainable Development.
HAZARDOUS WASTE MANAGEMENT
The OSCE assisted the South Caucasus countries in
addressing environmental risks stemming from hazardous
waste stored at abandoned industrial legacy sites. In
Georgia, the OSCE helped to assess risks at selected sites,
prioritized hotspots based on the magnitude and severity of
the risks, and developed risk mitigation measures. Similar
activities were launched in Armenia. The outcomes of the
assessments are intended to inform policy development
and action planning in Armenia and Georgia.

Uranium waste dumps in Central Asia pose risks not only to the
local population, but also to regional security due to seismic
activity and their proximity to transboundary rivers. With the
support of the EU and within the framework of the ENVSEC
Initiative, the OSCE supported stakeholder engagement
in uranium legacy remediation at several priority sites, as
for example at Maili-Suu, Kyrgyzstan, through training and
awareness raising activities conducted by the Aarhus Centres.

The Office of the Special Representative and Co-ordinator for Combating Trafficking in
Human Beings assists the OSCE participating States in their efforts to prevent human
trafficking, prosecute those who commit this abhorrent crime, and protect its victims. In the
midst of ongoing crisis situations in and around the OSCE region, the Office of the Special
Representative invested in devising good practices to enhance criminal justice responses
and undertook country visits to share them. The Office also sought to foster collaboration
with multi-stakeholder partnerships at both the national and international levels.

TRAFFICKING OF HUMAN BEINGS IN CRISIS
SITUATIONS AND HUMANITARIAN EMERGENCIES
The risk of trafficking in human beings, particularly for the
purposes of labour and sexual exploitation, continues
to increase in and around the OSCE region due to crisis
situations such as large scale migratory flows, conflicts,
displacement and humanitarian emergencies. Trafficking
in persons in crisis situations remained an area of focus
this year. In 2017, the Special Representative carried out
several official visits to temporary protection and first
reception centres in Greece, Italy and Serbia. These factfinding visits informed a needs assessment publication,
First Identification and Reception Facilities for Refugees and
Migrants in the OSCE Region, later issued by the Office. In
Ukraine, the Office conducted training courses for the OSCE
Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine monitors on how
to report potential cases of human trafficking and ensure
that the Mission’s activities do not contribute to any form
of exploitation. Since June 2017, the Office has conducted
research on possible links between terrorist activities and
human trafficking, identifying and analysing cases and
case studies across the OSCE region of deceitful or forced
recruitment of persons by terrorist groups for various
exploitative purposes.

LIVE SIMULATION TRAINING FOR
COMBATING HUMAN TRAFFICKING
ALONG MIGRATION ROUTES
Over 190 law enforcement officials, lawyers,
prosecutors, labour inspectors, financial and criminal
investigators, journalists, public social service providers,
cultural mediators and civil society representatives
from 47 OSCE participating States and four Partners
for Co-operation participated in three OSCE live
simulation exercises in Vicenza, Italy. These training
courses sought to improve cross-border co-operation,
address regulatory frameworks for the identification and
protection of victims, raise awareness of the gender
aspect of human trafficking, increase the use of financial
tools to investigate traffickers and compensate victims,
and explore new means for enhanced co-operation
and data exchange at the national and international
levels. The simulations dealt with sexual and labour
exploitation cases among migrants and children,
focusing on investigation and prosecution effectiveness
while maintaining a victim-centred approach.

COUNTRY VISITS
To support the OSCE’s efforts to combat human trafficking,
the Office of the Special Representative undertook a
number of country visits to meet with governments,
parliamentarians, members of the judiciary, international
organizations and NGOs. Such visits and follow-up visits
were made to several OSCE participating States, including
Canada, Denmark, the Russian Federation and Mongolia.
Country visit reports were published on Armenia, the
Russian Federation and Turkey.
ENDING TRAFFICKING IN CHILDREN
Since children are especially vulnerable and at risk of
labour and sexual exploitation, forced marriage, organ
removal, begging and other criminal activities, the 17th
Alliance against Trafficking in Persons conference in April
2017 focused on identifying threats to children in crisis,
promising practices for protection systems, and developing

Stockholm and Astana. These workshops brought together
participants from governments, civil society, international
organizations, the private sector and academia. Topics
of discussion included promising practices for preventing
human trafficking in public procurement and supply chains.

MOSCOW CONFERENCE ON PUBLIC-PRIVATE
PARTNERSHIP
In co-operation with the Foreign Ministry of the Russian
Federation, in July 2017 the Office organized an OSCEwide two-day conference on public-private partnership in
the fight against human trafficking at the Moscow State
Institute of International Relations. The event gathered some
200 representatives of 40 OSCE participating States and
Partners for Co-operation, as well as countries outside the
OSCE area, international organizations, non-governmental
entities, the private sector, trade unions, academia and the
media. They discussed relevant international frameworks
and instruments, the magnitude of human trafficking in the
private economy, the roles of governments and the private
sector, and related OSCE projects and activities.

Gender equality is a priority area for the OSCE, since equal rights for men and women and
the empowerment of women contribute to the achievement of comprehensive security.
The OSCE works to promote gender equality in the framework of comprehensive security,
including women, peace and security, women’s economic participation and combating
violence against women. Progress was assessed in all three OSCE dimensions during the
second Gender Equality Review Conference on 12 and 13 June, organized by the Gender
Section, the Austrian OSCE Chairmanship, and the Office for Democratic Institutions and
Human Rights.

WOMEN, PEACE AND SECURITY
Despite the recognition of the significant role of women
in the prevention and resolution of conflicts and in peace
building, women are still largely under-represented in conflict
mediation, including in the OSCE region. To address this
challenge, the OSCE’s Mediation Support Team and the
Gender Section organized a high-level retreat on the inclusion
of women and effective peace processes. The retreat had
20 participants, including senior representatives from the
Austrian Chairmanship, field operations, institutions and the
Secretariat, as well as from the OSCE Group of Friends of
Mediation.

The Gender Section, in partnership with the Washingtonbased organization Inclusive Security, organized the second
OSCE National Action Plan (NAP) Academy in Vienna. The
NAP Academies support the OSCE participating States
in drafting and improving their national action plans to
implement United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325
on Women, Peace and Security. Nineteen participating
States have benefited from this initiative to date. In
addition, a workshop on the implementation of UNSCR
1325 was organized in Ukraine for representatives from
regional administrations, national police and civil society
organizations.

COMBATING VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN
Women across the OSCE region are still subjected to
violence every day. During 2017, the Gender Section
organized a side event at the Human Dimension
Implementation Meeting in Warsaw, together with UN
Women and the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA).
The event addressed the root causes of violence against
women and girls and included a presentation by the
Chair of the Convention for the Elimination of all Forms of
Discrimination against Women Committee, Dalia Leinarte.
Participants discussed measures to combat gender-based
violence, and ways to increase knowledge of it.
The Gender Section continued to support the engagement
of men and boys in combating gender-based violence
and promoting gender equality. More than 50 government
representatives, international organizations, civil society
representatives and academics from across the OSCE

region participated in an expert meeting to share good
practices on increasing men’s engagement. The meeting
included a theatre performance, Macho Men, by the
Serbian theatre Reflektor, a project that encourages young
men to challenge harmful behaviour and practices.

As the primary institution within the OSCE focusing on the human dimension of security,
the Warsaw-based Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) provides
support, assistance and expertise to participating States and civil society to promote
democracy, the rule of law, human rights, tolerance and non-discrimination, and Roma and
Sinti issues.
During 2017, ODIHR launched a new election observer database, continued to promote the
protection of human rights, supported tolerance and non-discrimination, and continued to
monitor elections across the OSCE region.

“Only strong democratic institutions
and practices, based on principles of
pluralism, inclusion and the rule of law,
can provide the foundation for societies
in which the rights and interests of all
can be promoted and protected. Societies
based on these values are also the best
equipped to find peaceful solutions when
these rights and interests collide.”

On 26 June 2017, ODIHR launched a new
Election Expert Database (electionexpert.
odihr.pl) to improve the management of
staff recruitment for all ODIHR election
observation activities. The new database
is designed to increase the transparency
and efficiency of observer registration and
recruitment procedures, and to enable
the monitoring of the geographical and
gender balance of election mission staff.

ELECTIONS
In 2017, ODIHR continued to support democratic
processes across the OSCE region by observing elections
and referendums in 20 participating States. In the course
of the year, ODIHR published over 60 reports on election
activities. These reports comprehensively assessed
electoral processes against OSCE commitments,
international obligations and other standards, and
provided recommendations to participating States on
how they might improve the transparency and quality
of their elections. The Office supported 13 participating
States in their efforts to implement ODIHR’s electoral
recommendations by providing technical expertise
during country visits or reviewing proposed amendments
to electoral legislation. ODIHR also strengthened its
methodology for election observation by training election
observers and by releasing two new publications:
Guidelines for Public Security Providers in Elections and
the Handbook on Observing and Promoting the Electoral
Participation of Persons with Disabilities. On 28 November,
ODIHR hosted the third annual Electoral Seminar in
Vienna, with a focus on election observation and the role
of technology in electoral processes.
DEMOCRATIZATION
In 2017, ODIHR continued its work to promote judicial
independence, judicial accountability, and diversity and
equal gender representation within the judiciary. As part
of this work, ODIHR built the capacity of 46 NGOs to
monitor fair trial rights. The Office’s democratic governance
work focused on promoting parliamentary ethics and

strengthening frameworks that regulate political finance;
strengthening the role of women in decision-making
processes; promoting gender-sensitive democratic
institutions; and promoting the political participation of
under-represented groups, including young people and
persons with disabilities. ODIHR assisted participating
States in their efforts to develop legislation in compliance
with international standards and to make their legislative
processes more transparent and effective. This work
was complemented by improvements to ODIHR’s online
legislative database (legislationline.org), which helps
participating States bring their legislation in line with
international human rights standards. Throughout the year,
ODIHR responded to requests for support in the field of
migration, providing capacity-building and awarenessraising activities for over 500 professionals, generating
policy recommendations on emerging migration-related
challenges, and launching an important new resource
on identity management and travel documents, the
Compendium of Good Practices in Identity Management.

gathered information on national anti-trafficking practices
for the purpose of updating the existing publication National
Referral Mechanisms – Joining Efforts to Protect the Rights
of Trafficked Persons: A Practical Handbook. ODIHR
organized capacity-building events and provided expert
advice to state and non-state actors on human rights
issues. These training and discussion events focused on the
following topics: human rights and counter-terrorism; the
policing of public events and freedom of peaceful assembly;
mainstreaming gender and human rights in the security
sector; and the prevention of torture. Other projects covered
freedom of religion or belief; the protection of human rights
defenders; the strengthening of national human rights
institutions; and human rights education. Also, the theme of
the annual Human Dimension Seminar was the rights of the
child, focusing on children in situations of risk.
TOLERANCE AND NON-DISCRIMINATION
Throughout 2017, ODIHR continued its work with OSCE
participating States and civil society on tolerance and nondiscrimination issues. The majority of participating States
agreed to implement the Training against Hate Crime for
Law Enforcement and Prosecutors and Hate Crime Training
programmes, which provide guidance on how police and
prosecutors can recognize and pursue hate crimes. ODIHR
also published detailed hate crime data from participating

also marked the beginning of a two-year project on finding a
comprehensive response to hate crime in four participating
States. The Office pursued its efforts to counter racism,
xenophobia, anti-Semitism and intolerance against Muslims
and Christians. Two conferences were held during the year:
one on intolerance against Muslims and another on intolerance
against Christians. As part of the project Words into Action to
counter anti-Semitism, ODIHR issued a publication entitled
Understanding Anti-Semitic Hate Crime and the Security
Needs of Jewish Communities. It provides educational
guidelines on anti-Semitism for teachers and information on
how to build coalitions between different communities.

Commissioner
on National
Minorities

High Commissioner: Ambassador Lamberto Zannier (as of 19 July 2017)
Budget: €3,407,600 (Unified budget), €342,270 (Extrabudgetary pledges)
Staff: 17 international, 14 local (including 3 under extrabudgetary projects)
www.osce.org/high-commissioner-on-national-minorities

The office of the High Commissioner on National Minorities (HCNM) was established in
1992 to identify and seek early resolution of ethnic tensions that might endanger peace,
stability or friendly relations within or among OSCE participating States.
For the first half of the year, the office was led by Director and Officer-in-Charge Henrik
Villadsen, pending the appointment of a successor to Astrid Thors, whose mandate ended
in August 2016.
Lamberto Zannier was appointed as the new High Commissioner in July 2017, whereupon
he started to implement his mandate. He addressed a range of challenges related to
national minorities and conflict risks in the OSCE area. This included a thematic focus on
access to justice and national minorities, as well as on the management of diversity.

ACCESS TO JUSTICE AND NATIONAL MINORITIES
In November, the High Commissioner launched a new
set of recommendations, The Graz Recommendations on
Access to Justice and National Minorities. This was followed
by side events at the Supplementary Human Dimension
Meeting in November and the OSCE Ministerial Council in
December, both in Vienna, where these recommendations
were presented to OSCE participating States and other
stakeholders.
The Graz Recommendations aim at supporting OSCE
participating States’ efforts to improve the trust of national
minorities in their justice systems. Lack of trust can
undermine social cohesion, foster alienation and increase
the risk of ethnic conflict.

INTEGRATION OF DIVERSE SOCIETIES
The High Commissioner continued the office’s long-term
work to promote the development and implementation
of integration policies across the OSCE region, in line
with The Ljubljana Guidelines on Integration of Diverse
Societies. He supported Moldova’s work to implement
its Strategy on the Consolidation of Interethnic Relations,
including by assisting in the development of an Action
Plan, which was adopted in November 2017. The
office of the High Commissioner also contributed to
an assessment of the implementation of Kyrgyzstan’s
State Concept on Strengthening the Unity of the People
and Interethnic Relations (2013–2017) as a basis for
subsequent integration policies. In Georgia, the High
Commissioner continued to provide advice and project

support for the implementation of the State Strategy on
Civic Equality and its five-year Action Plan (2015–2020).
EDUCATION
The office of the High Commissioner continued to support
education in southern Serbia, including through its longterm work with the Bujanovac Department of the Subotica
Faculty of Economics of Novi Sad University. The High
Commissioner engaged with the government of Ukraine on
how best to accommodate the ethnic and linguistic diversity
of the country’s society, particularly in the context of its new
law on education. Addressing the matter during his visit to
Ukraine in December, he expressed full support for policies
aiming at strengthening the role of the state language
for effective integration, at the same time highlighting the
importance of an inclusive policy in which the needs of
diverse groups are taken into consideration.
The office of the High Commissioner continued to assist
the Central Asian countries with a regional programme on
education. In May, the HCNM supported the first Olympiad
on multilingualism in Central Asia, held in Kazakhstan, which
focused on mother tongues, state and official languages,
as well as foreign languages. The Olympiad attracted 102
students from 25 universities in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and

Tajikistan who collectively speak 18 languages. In December,
the High Commissioner organized a multilingual and
intercultural education conference in Shymkent, Kazakhstan,
for specialists and policymakers from ten OSCE participating
States. In Moldova, the High Commissioner supported
the introduction of multilingual education in kindergartens
in the Autonomous Territorial Unit of Gagauzia. The High
Commissioner also visited the South East European
University (SEEU) in Tetovo, where he highlighted the need to
honour the legacy of the first High Commissioner, Max van
der Stoel, the founding father of SEEU, including by opposing
and reversing segregation in education and society.
BILINGUAL DICTIONARIES
As part of a long-term effort to promote the integration of
societies, improve multilingual education and help build
bridges between communities in South-Eastern Europe,
the High Commissioner led the development of illustrated
bilingual dictionaries for primary school children. Print
copies of the first such dictionaries for Serbian-Albanian/
Albanian-Serbian and Macedonian-Albanian/AlbanianMacedonian were distributed to schools in Skopje, Tetovo,
Gostivar and other locations in southern Serbia. Both
dictionaries are also available online and as mobile apps for
iOS and Android.

Representative
on Freedom of
the Media

Representative: Harlem Désir (as of 19 July 2017),
Dunja Mijatović (until 10 March 2017)
Budget: €1,481,600 (Unified budget), €582,869 (Extrabudgetary pledges)
Staff: 15
www.osce.org/representative-on-freedom-of-media

In 2017, the OSCE marked the 20th anniversary of the decision by the participating States
on the Mandate of the Representative on Freedom of the Media. The Representative’s
mandate is to observe media developments in the participating States and to advocate and
promote full compliance with the Organization’s principles and commitments in respect of
freedom of expression and free media.

MAJOR ISSUES
Attacks against journalists took place almost daily in
the OSCE region. The majority of the Representative’s
interventions – 203 in 2017 in 34 participating States
– concerned the safety of journalists and their right
to work free of threats to their physical security. The
Representative also frequently intervened in cases in
which journalists were imprisoned, accused of supporting
terrorism, or charged with economic crimes or criminal
defamation. Over 170 journalists are currently in prison in
the OSCE region.
In order to quantify the extent of impunity for killings of
journalists, the Office of the Representative on Freedom of
the Media compiled a list of members of the media who
have been killed in the OSCE region in the last 25 years
and the justice response to these killings. The list includes
399 names and shows that in 85 per cent of the cases
the perpetrators or masterminds were not brought to
justice. The fight against impunity remains a priority for the
Representative.

Threats and intimidation, offline and online, including the
targeting of female journalists, constitute a severe threat
to media freedom. The Representative increased efforts
in 2017 to assist the participating States in combating
online threats to female journalists. A series of workshops
in Vienna, as well as the online campaign Safety of Female
Journalists Online (#SOFJO), brought together journalists,

Budget: €2,892,700 (Unified budget), €259,291 (Extrabudgetary pledges)
Staff: 16 international, 62 local (including 4 under extrabudgetary projects)
www.osce.org/presence-in-albania

In 2017, the Presence in Albania maintained its partnership with Albania’s institutions
according to their shared priorities. It continued to assist in strengthening the role of
citizens and use the OSCE’s regional reach to address regional challenges.

SHARED CHALLENGES, SHARED
COMMITMENTS
The Presence continued its multi-faceted work against
corruption, co-operating with central and local authorities,
young people and the private sector. It strengthened
the capacity of the Inter-Institutional Group against
Environmental Crime to identify, address and prosecute
environmental crime and corruption.
Anti-trafficking efforts continued to be supported by the
Presence through a multi-disciplinary approach based on
prevention, protection and prosecution.
In addition, the Presence contributed to improving the
country’s capacity to fight serious and organized crime by
means of intelligence guided policing. It provided concrete
recommendations for improved forensic procedures and
handling of informants by the state police.

Together with the OSCE Chairmanship, the Presence
initiated a new focus on young people in 2017. A first-ofits-kind programme called Youth Trail: Promoting OSCE
Values in the Western Balkans brought together 37 young
participants from across the region. It resulted in a lively
exchange of information and ideas on democracy, activism,
security and co-operation.
ACTIVE CITIZENS
The Presence continued to support the active participation
of citizens in activities related to all three OSCE dimensions.
Working in underdeveloped areas, including with vulnerable
groups, the Presence increased the ability of citizens
to engage in democratic participation and monitoring
processes by providing training courses, practical tools and
access to information.
Prior to the 2017 parliamentary elections, the Presence ran
a voter education campaign for 760 Roma women and

this topic in discussions and visits to sites that were
notorious during the communist regime. The Presence
also provided in-house expert support for Albania’s
newly established authority for dealing with the files of the
communist-era state security police.

The Presence supported the outreach of Members of
Parliaments to their constituents, and encouraged and
assisted cross-party activities. To foster transparency,
accountability and democratic governance of institutions,
it also facilitated debates and public engagement in the
Assembly’s Committee on Labour, Social Issues and
Health.

STRONGER INSTITUTIONS, TRUSTED
INSTITUTIONS
As part of its multi-year support to transform Albanian
Radio and Television into a credible public broadcaster, the
Presence assisted with a new development strategy, as well
as with preparations for establishing a training centre and
public forums on the role of public service media.

“Important projects like the Youth
Trail initiated by the OSCE Presence
give young people from the region
the opportunity to connect and
discuss important issues; they help
a new generation of young activists
to push forward our ambition for a
European Balkans.”
Erion Veliaj
Mayor of Tirana

HUMAN SECURITY, HUMAN RIGHTS
The Presence continued to facilitate multi-agency and
community resilience against the threat of extremism and
radicalization. It organized capacity-building events for
Local Security Councils by supporting citizen engagement
and community policing. In 2017, the Presence began
assisting authorities to focus on the human rights aspects
of violent extremism cases, as well as on the prevention of
radicalization in the prison and probation systems.
The Presence’s advocacy and awareness-raising activities
related to human rights included supporting the 12th
International Human Rights Film Festival in Albania. The
festival explored the root causes and complex dynamics of
populism and radicalism, encouraging lively public debates
on how to address such issues without jeopardizing human
rights.
Building on its earlier success in encouraging public debate
on Albania’s past, the Presence supported a summer

FIELD OPERATIONS  n  Presence in Albania

The Presence continued to help the country with reinforcing
an inclusive, transparent and accountable law-making
process, placing emphasis on the efficient use of consulting
mechanisms. It carried out capacity-building events for
public officials, NGOs and academics. Building on these
events, the Presence developed guidelines on the Law on
Public Consultations and Notification in order to increase
the capacities of relevant stakeholders.
Within the framework of Albania’s justice reform, the
Presence partnered with the OSCE Office for Democratic
Institutions and Human Rights as well as various local and
international actors to train 23 representatives from NGOs
on fair trial rights and the monitoring of judicial proceedings.
Due to the initiative “Justice without delays” of the Presence,
which is aimed at increasing the efficiency of court
proceedings, the length of proceedings and the number of
unproductive hearings decreased in all participating courts.
The Presence continued to raise awareness of alternatives
to imprisonment, and enhance co-operation between
probation officers, judges and prosecutors, with the result
that the use of such alternatives progressively increased.
PARTNERSHIPS
Partners in 2017 included the Council of Europe, the
European Broadcasting Union, the United States
Agency for International Development (USAID), the
EU, several UN agencies, the European Assistance
Mission to the Albanian Justice System (EURALIUS),

Mission to
Bosnia and
Herzegovina

Head of Mission: Ambassador Bruce G. Berton (as of 2 September 2017),
Ambassador Jonathan Moore (until 1 September 2017)
Budget: €11,373,600 (Unified budget), €932,889 (Extrabudgetary pledges)
Staff: 29 international, 290 local (including 11 under extrabudgetary projects)
www.osce.org/mission-to-bosnia-and-herzegovina

The OSCE Mission to Bosnia and Herzegovina continued to play a vital role in enhancing
Bosnia and Herzegovina’s ability to foster a sustainable and stable security environment, to
strengthen environmental governance and to encourage its consolidation as a democratic
society. The Mission supported key reforms and worked to promote and protect the human
rights of all citizens.

YOUTH AND GENDER
The Mission focused on promoting the political participation
of women by working with political parties to improve
internal structures and processes, as well as on combating
domestic violence through building the capacities of police
officers. It supported domestic violence trial monitoring and
provided technical tools for enhancing collaboration among
responders to such crimes. The innovative Youth Advisory
Group, consisting of young volunteers from across the
country, helped the Mission integrate youth perspectives,
for example, by involving young people in the planning
and implementation of activities aimed at preventing
radicalization and violent extremism.

As a result of the Mission’s persistent advocacy efforts,
a long-awaited provision on non-persecution and nonpunishment of victims of trafficking was adopted in the
Republika Srpska criminal legislation.

STRENTHENING THE RULE OF LAW
The Mission issued a report entitled Towards Justice for
Survivors of Conflict-Related Sexual Violence in Bosnia
and Herzegovina: Progress before Courts in Bosnia and
Herzegovina 2014–2016. Based on the trial monitoring
findings, the Mission organized a series of training sessions
for the judiciary and police on selected topics related to
the investigation and prosecution of serious crimes. It
provided technical assistance to its counterparts in an effort
to find effective solutions to problems affecting the judicial
response to war crimes, hate crimes and trafficking in
human beings.

QUALITY, NON-DISCRIMINATORY EDUCATION
Working with elected officials, school administrators,
teachers and parents, the Mission continued to exercise
its leading role in assisting the host country in reforming
its education system and preventing discrimination in
education. It responded to emerging challenges and
tensions provoked by the use of education to deepen
societal divisions.

PREVENTING AND RESPONDING TO HATE AND
EXTREMISM
Thirty-one Coalitions against Hate continued to be active
across the country, comprised of 280 organizations and
individuals. With the Mission’s support, the Coalitions
organized 150 events in 34 locations aimed at preventing
hate crimes and bias-motivated incidents, as well as
promoting tolerance and interethnic co-operation.

The Mission finalized the Guidelines for Recognition of
Discrimination in Education, designed to help children,
parents, school administrators and education beneficiaries
to recognize and act against discrimination in education.
STRENGTHENING INTER-RELIGOUS DIALOGUE
The Mission intensified its promotion of inter-religious
dialogue among different ethnicities and religious groups,
especially in ethnically and religiously sensitive communities.
It supported eight events in different local communities

In Jajce, the Mission successfully supported
students in preventing the establishment of a
new “two schools under one roof” system, which
would have deepened ethnic segregation in
education. This was achieved through enhanced
co-ordination with the international community
and extensive lobbying with high-level political
structures, local authorities, school directors,
teachers, religious leaders and students.

across the country and two major events at the state level.
The Mission also facilitated the work of the country’s InterReligious Council (IRC). Among other initiatives, in April, the
Mission assisted visits of IRC members to four locations
where atrocities were committed against Bosniaks, Serbs,
Croats and Jews during the 1990s war and World War
II. This was the first time leaders from different religious
communities jointly paid their respects to victims from each
other’s ethnic groups.
SUPPORTING ANTI-CORRUPTION AT ALL LEVELS
The Mission kicked off new activities aimed at supporting
authorities at the state and local levels in their efforts
to fight corruption. Its engagement focused on the
development and effective implementation of priority anticorruption legislation, as well as the co-ordination between
various anti-corruption bodies. The Mission helped the
country streamline its efforts to fight corruption in the
currently highly complex institutional framework, which
includes fragmented anti-corruption policies that have
been implemented at different levels of government. In
2017, the Mission continued to support the strengthening
of parliamentary oversight for security sector institutions
and administrative bodies, while promoting transparency
and accountability through improved whistle-blower
protection, conflict of interest prevention and asset
declaration for public officials.
SECURITY CO-OPERATION AND PREVENTION
OF VIOLENT EXTREMISM AND RADICALIZATION
THAT LEAD TO TERRORISM (VERLT)
Building on the country’s action plan on the CounterTerrorism Strategy for 2015–2020, the Mission expanded

its assistance to local-level actors in preventing VERLT
through its broad field presence in Bosnia and Herzegovina
and holistic approach by mainstreaming the prevention of
VERLT into all aspects of the Mission’s work. The Mission
led international efforts to upgrade the physical security and
stockpile management of weapons and ammunition, and
initiated support in the fight against cybercrime and cyberenabled crime.
ENVIRONMENTAL AWARENESS
As part of its efforts to strengthen environmental
governance and protection, the Mission continued to
provide logistical assistance and advocacy support to the
network of Aarhus Centres across the country. It developed
local disaster risk reduction and preparedness capacities
by supporting the organization, monitoring and assessment
of a Euro-Atlantic Disaster Response Co-ordination Centre
Field Exercise. Amongst other scenarios, the field exercise
simulated the 2014 floods.
MEDIA FREEDOM
The Mission monitored violations of free expression and
raised its voice in defence of the media community. In
September, it supported the Institution of Human Rights
Ombudsman of Bosnia and Herzegovina in presenting
its special report on the status and safety of journalists
in the country. Improving professional standards in
journalism with a specific focus on the reporting of political
campaigns and finding solutions for financing the public
broadcasting service continued to be at the core of the
Mission’s work.

PARTNERSHIPS
The Mission supported Bosnia and Herzegovina’s
European Youth Parliament in holding its annual national
session; the country’s Presidency Chair in organizing
an unprecedented visit to local communities in western
Bosnia and Herzegovina; and the Inter-Religious
Council’s visits to Sarajevo, Vitez and Kneževo. An

Politically, the year 2017 was eventful in Kosovo1. The Mission adapted well to the
circumstances and demonstrated its relevance to all stakeholders. Key activities for the
Mission were its support of the Kosovo-wide collection of votes for the Serbian presidential
election and, in the four northern Kosovo municipalities, of the conduct of the Kosovo
Assembly and municipal elections. In all three large-scale operations, the Mission enabled
access to the polls and contributed to alleviating possible tensions. The Mission engaged
in extensive field monitoring, in particular regarding non-majority community issues, and
facilitated immediate solutions to identified concerns.

COMMUNITY RIGHTS
As a result of the Mission’s advocacy efforts to promote
inter-community dialogue, 19 municipalities from three
regions signed joint declarations committing to develop
and endorse common plans for the promotion of intercommunity relations.
The Mission organized a first high-level forum on language
compliance, bringing together officials and speakers from
bilingual and multilingual jurisdictions to raise awareness
among local institutions on language rights, and to enhance
the implementation of the legal framework in Kosovo,
considered in line with advanced international standards
of multilingualism. The forum provided a basis for further
Mission advocacy in this area.
LEGISLATIVE SUPPORT
The Mission reviewed 20 draft laws, six regulations, six
administrative instructions and six concept documents
drafted by government entities. To improve language
compliance and support judicial integration, the Mission

conducted a review of nine laws important for the
functioning of the judiciary. It identified 49 substantive
errors in the Serbian-language versions of these laws, and
strongly advocated the approval of a draft law on legal acts
by the government. This resulted in the swift approval of
improved Serbian-language versions of all laws; they have
equal status with Albanian-language legislation. The Mission
monitored 2,404 hearings related to 1,414 court cases,
both criminal and civil. The priority areas for Mission court
monitoring were cases pertaining to terrorism, corruption,
women’s rights, domestic violence, war crimes and
community rights, including, notably, interethnic property
disputes.
MEDIA DEVELOPMENT
In the context of the Mission’s work with journalist
associations and institutions of justice, a prosecutor
co-ordinator was appointed to deal with cases of crimes
against journalists. This resulted in the sentencing of several
perpetrators in October.
The Mission, together with the Ministry of Education,
launched a media literacy initiative and trained 14 local
schoolteachers on media literacy. Following a pilot phase
in seven lower secondary schools, it is planned to integrate
media literacy into the formal education curriculum.

In 2017, the Mission continued to assist Montenegro’s ongoing reform process and support
the country in addressing the recommendations of the OSCE Office for Democratic
Institutions and Human Rights with regard to Montenegro’s October 2016 parliamentary
elections. The Mission also supported the Montenegro’s State Election Commission to
strengthen its capacities in electoral administration, and its Agency for Electronic Media to
follow up on the recommendations regarding political advertising. It co-operated closely
with national partners to further promote freedom of the media, good governance, human
rights, security co-operation and gender equality.

SUPPORT FOR ELECTION REFORMS
The Mission provided technical assistance to the State
Election Commission (SEC) to strengthen its institutional
capacities. Support included providing international election
experts; training on strategic and operational planning for SEC
members and staff and Municipal Election Commissions;
training in the use of new technologies in election processes;
promotion of gender mainstreaming; and delivery of new
office equipment to increase the SEC’s efficiency. To support
the efforts of the Agency for Electronic Media (AEM) to

improve the legal framework regulating political advertising,
the Mission commissioned a comparative study on political
advertising and media campaigning. This study, which
provides a broad comparison of methods in different legal
systems and offers recommendations for improving existing
legal frameworks, was shared with stakeholders.
PROTECTION OF CHILDREN FROM HARMFUL
MEDIA AND INTERNET CONTENT
In co-operation with the AEM and Montenegro’s Office
for the Protection of Human Rights, the Mission designed
and implemented an awareness-raising campaign to
enhance standards of professional reporting, promote the
rights of children, and protect children from being used in
political advertising. It supported a regional conference that
examined ways to protect children from harmful media and
Internet content, with a special emphasis on preventing the
exploitation of children in political advertising.
A GUIDE ON THE SAFETY OF JOURNALISTS
REPORTING ON PROTESTS
Following arbitrary arrests, mistreatment and intimidation
by the police and hindrances to journalists covering
public protests in Montenegro, the Mission produced a
Montenegrin-language guide for media outlets on journalist
safety when reporting on protests. Five hundred copies
of the guide were distributed to journalists and media
representatives, as well as one hundred sets of journalism
equipment, including visible press insignia for additional

supported the development of projects promoting
reconciliation through youth mobility, co-operation and
activism within the region. The Mission also worked to
strengthen the capacities of NGOs to develop relevant
proposals.

DEVELOPMENT OF GUIDELINES TO
SAFEGUARD THE RIGHTS OF VICTIMS OF
TRAFFICKING
To safeguard the rights of victims of trafficking, the Mission,
in partnership with Montenegro’s Ministry of Interior Affairs,
supported a working group of experts from the OSCE and
Montenegro’s National Office for Combating Trafficking
in Human Beings, as well as the judiciary, prosecution
representatives, the police and civil society, to develop
guidelines for police, prosecution representatives and
judges.

Staff: 20 international, 119 local (including 11 under extrabudgetary projects)
www.osce.org/mission-to-serbia

In 2017, the Mission assisted Serbia in strengthening its institutional and policy framework
for accountable and efficient police and justice systems, inclusive democracy, and
independent and quality media. Adapting its activities to the evolving needs of the host
country, the Mission worked in partnership with state institutions, civil society and media,
fostering ownership, building their capacities and facilitating regional co-operation.

COMBATING TRANSNATIONAL THREATS
Building upon the regional prosecutors’ declaration of
intent to step up regional co-operation in combating
organized crime, the Mission continued to support the
networking of prosecutors of organized crime and facilitated
the organization of a third regional conference in Rome.
The conference enabled organized-crime prosecutors
from Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia,
Hungary, Italy, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia,
Montenegro, Romania, Serbia and Slovenia to improve
co-operation and share information on combating serious
transnational crime and terrorism.
The Mission partnered with the Interior Ministry in
operationalizing the Task Force to Combat Migrant
Smuggling, which quickly became a model for other
countries in the region. To further enhance regional
co-operation, the Mission facilitated the exchange of
information between the Task Force and its counterparts
in neighbouring countries. As part of its comprehensive
efforts to help Serbia tackle emerging transnational threats,
the Mission also partnered with relevant counterparts in

INCLUSION OF NATIONAL MINORITIES –
SERBIAN AS NON-MOTHER TONGUE
To assist Serbia in ensuring that youth from national minority
communities have equal access to the labour market
and state institutions, the Mission continued its work to
develop standards for teaching Serbian as a non-mother
tongue. This subject is taught in primary and secondary
schools that provide education in the languages of national
minorities. In 2017, the Mission supported the development
of corresponding curricula, and facilitated training in
teaching standards for 400 teachers from 90 primary and
40 secondary schools where instruction is in Albanian or
Hungarian.

SUPPORTING FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION
AND MEDIA PROFESSIONALISM
In 2017, the Mission fostered dialogue between
state institutions, media professionals, the
academic community, and civil society in
debating media policy solutions:
 To involve the academic community in analyzing
public interest media content and rethinking
media policy, the Mission organized a regional
conference on media credibility, bringing together
media researchers from South-Eastern Europe.
 To help policymakers and media professionals respond
to the demands of the digital era, the Mission, in
partnership with Germany, organized an international
conference in Belgrade entitled Agenda for Change:
Developing Media in the Digital Age, in Belgrade.
 At the local level, the Mission facilitated ten
debates on media literacy and on the role of local
media outlets in providing public interest content.
Involving civil society and local self-governments,
the debates involved over 400 participants.
 The Mission supported a journalistic exchange
between two prominent journalists from Serbia and
Albania. In a total of 12 articles, the two journalists
discussed topics intended to further mutual
understanding between their respective societies.

TOWARDS A MODERN JUSTICE SYSTEM
To ensure an independent, accountable and effective
justice system, the Mission supported Serbia’s ongoing
judicial and constitutional reform and assisted members
of state institutions and legal associations in developing
their skills. Working with a range of institutions, from the
Anti-Corruption Agency to the Chamber of Commerce,
the Mission also supported Serbia in the fight against
corruption. In partnership with the Ministry of Justice,
the Mission assisted the correctional service in adopting
progressive measures to improve the education and reintegration of offenders, focusing particularly on women and
youth.

“The most successful strategy
for curbing violent behaviour is
to prevent and defuse extremism
before it turns into violence.
Education, working with local
communities and with young
people, and raising media literacy
are some of the preventive
activities. This task calls for a
multi-dimensional, comprehensive approach and
co-ordinated efforts of all relevant institutions and
community actors. Their active involvement and

In 2017, the OSCE Mission to Skopje focused on supporting the implementation of the
Ohrid Framework Agreement, advancing interethnic relations, providing early warning on
security-related developments, and assisting in the country’s reform process. The year
2017 was also a milestone for the Mission as it marked its 25th anniversary.

FIELD PRESENCE AND EARLY WARNING
Early warning is at the core of the Mission’s mandate.
Being the only international organization in the country
with the capacity and expertise to monitor security-related
developments countrywide, the Mission continued to add
value in 2017 through its field presence. Throughout the
winter, the Mission monitored the situation as a political

demonstrations over an extended period. This political crisis
culminated on 27 April with an attack on the parliament,
during which the Mission provided real-time information
from the ground to the OSCE Secretariat and the
Chairmanship.
IMPROVING ELECTION MANAGEMENT
PROCEDURES
One of the Mission’s goals remains the improvement
of election management procedures. In 2017, the
Mission supported the State Election Commission
(SEC) to introduce structural changes in line with the

recommendations of the OSCE Office for Democratic
Institutions and Human Rights. To improve access to the
electoral process for persons with disabilities, the Mission
supported the SEC in mapping all polling stations that are
wheelchair accessible and provided expert guidance to
SEC on how to produce ballots in Braille.
TRIAL MONITORING
The Mission continued its trial monitoring activities by
attending more than 105 trial hearings on 16 high-profile

Mission to
Moldova

Head of Mission: Ambassador Michael Scanlan
Budget: €2,264,000 (Unified budget), €94,567 (Extrabudgetary pledges)
Staff: 9 international, 40 local (including 1 under an extrabudgetary project)
www.osce.org/mission-to-moldova

The core mandate of the OSCE Mission to Moldova is to help achieve a comprehensive,
peaceful and sustainable settlement of the Transdniestrian conflict based on the territorial
integrity and sovereignty of the Republic of Moldova, with a special status for Transdniestria
within Moldova. In 2017, with the Mission’s continuous support, the Sides achieved a
breakthrough in the settlement process, signing agreements on five priority issues.
Implementation of these agreements will contribute to shaping the realities on the ground in
line with the end state endorsed by all 57 OSCE participating States. The Mission, in close
co-operation with the OSCE institutions, also continued to support Moldova in achieving its
political commitments to uphold human rights, and to promote an inclusive civic identity and
a culture of tolerance, which are important corollary issues to the settlement process.

HISTORIC MOMENTUM TO ACCELERATE THE
TRANSDNIESTRIAN SETTLEMENT PROCESS
The Gura Bicului-Bychok Bridge over the Dniester/
Nistru River connecting the two Sides was re-opened
for automobile traffic on 18 November for the first time
since its destruction in the armed conflict in 1992 and the
completion of repairs in 2001. This historic decision signed
in the Mission’s Office paved the way for agreements on
several important social and economic issues signed by
the Sides on 25 November 2017. These developments
were welcomed at a 5+2 meeting organized in Vienna
on 27 and 28 November, where the Sides committed to
achieving additional practical outputs in the course of 2018.
The talks in the 5+2 format included the participation of
representatives of the Sides, Mediators and Observers –

HIGHLIGHTS OF THE YEAR
 the opening between the Sides of the Gura
Bicului-Bychok Bridge, the primary east-west
international transportation corridor, which
was closed for traffic for the past 25 years;
 realization of the aspiration declared in the 2016
OSCE Ministerial Statement for an output-based
approach to the Transdniestrian settlement process;
 reaching of agreements by the Sides on four priority
issues that start the process of defining the end state;
 implementation of an action plan for the
consolidation of interethnic relations, and for the
study and commemoration of the Holocaust.

of the Sides in the negotiation process was the personal
engagement of the leadership in Chisinau and Tiraspol,
which complemented the efforts and dedication of the
Sides’ Chief Negotiators and experts of the Working Groups.
PROMOTING AN INCLUSIVE CIVIC IDENTITY
AND AN OPEN, TOLERANT SOCIETY
Promoting an inclusive society and identity in Moldova
remains an important goal for achieving the end state of
the settlement process. The Mission aligned its activities
with Moldova’s recent commitments to promote the
consolidation of interethnic relations in the country, to
encourage both quality teaching of the State language
and education in minority languages, and to ensure the
representation of national minorities in the public sector

and their access to the justice system. In this regard, the
Mission worked closely with OSCE High Commissioner on
National Minorities. The Mission also encouraged greater
focus on translating these international commitments
into policies and actions by supporting the government
in drafting a three-year Action Plan for 2017–2020 for the
implementation of the Strategy for the Consolidation of
Interethnic Relations approved by the Cabinet of Ministers
on 15 November 2017.
The Mission also provided technical assistance to the
joint Working Group convening Moldova’s Members of
Parliament and deputies in the People’s Assembly of
the Autonomous Territorial Unit of Gagauzia, a regional
legislature, with the goal of laying the groundwork for
harmonizing Moldova’s legislation with the 1994 law on
Gagauzia’s special status, and of clarifying and affirming
Gagauzia’s autonomy.

PARTNERSHIPS
As part of the ODIHR regional project Turning Words
into Action to Address Anti-Semitism, the Mission
discussed ways to combat anti-Semitism through
education with state authorities, civil society, academia
and international organizations. The Mission fostered
ties between Moldova’s experts and their Romanian
peers to enable the country to change its history course
curriculum to accurately reflect the tragic events of the
Holocaust in the local context, as well as to establish a
museum commemorating Jewish heritage. The Mission
also facilitated interaction between Moldova’s officials
and the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance.
In September Moldova’s Public Property Agency
extended authorization to the Jewish community in
Moldova to restore the building of the former Rabbi
Tsirilson Synagogue in Chisinau.

Special
Monitoring
Mission to
Ukraine

Chief Monitor: Ambassador Ertuğrul Apakan
Budget: €105,501,500 for the period 1 April 2017 to 31 March 2018, with €84,401,200
from assessed contributions and €21,100,300 from extrabudgetary contributions with
€10,175,563 pledged
Staff: 1,160 (785 international, 375 local) including 695 monitors as of 31 December 2017
www.osce.org/special-monitoring-mission-to-ukraine

With almost 1,200 staff members throughout the country, the Special Monitoring Mission
(SMM) to Ukraine contributed to reducing tensions and fostering peace, stability and security
throughout Ukraine. The Chief Monitor Ambassador Ertuğrul Apakan was engaged in the
work of the Trilateral Contact Group (TCG) format by co-ordinating its Working Group on
Security Issues. He repeatedly called upon the sides, among other things, to reaffirm their
commitments to the ceasefire, and the Mission closely monitored the implementation of
these commitments on the ground. This resulted in brief periods of relative calm. The SMM
also regularly contributed to discussions held in the Normandy format.
The SMM expanded its 24/7 presence by opening a new forward patrol base in Popasna and
installing additional camera systems along the contact line. While the Minsk agreements have
yet to be fully implemented, the Mission remains determined to carry out in full its mandate
and its role in supporting their implementation, including monitoring and reporting on the
security situation as well as facilitating dialogue.

SECURITY SITUATION
Throughout the year, the security situation in eastern
Ukraine remained volatile. The highest levels of violence
in 2017 were recorded during the first three months of the
year, resulting in significant destruction and loss of life. The
SMM observed the continued use of heavy weapons, also
close to residential areas.

overcome significant risks and limitations associated with
deploying ground patrols in high-risk environments.

Despite the Framework Decision of the TCG on 21
September 2016 to disengage forces and hardware from
three areas – Stanytsia Luhanska, Petrivske and
Zolote – disengagement was only partially implemented,
with the Mission reporting ceasefire violations in or around
these areas on a regular basis. The Mission increased
its monitoring capacity through a security upgrade of a
forward patrol base and the installation of a new camera
near the Stanytsia Luhanska disengagement area.
The SMM continued to monitor the security situation in
other parts of Ukraine as well, including by monitoring
public gatherings. The Mission also followed up on the
situation of internally displaced persons (IDP) in collective
centres and, in close co-operation with the OSCE Project
Co-ordinator in Ukraine, supported the facilitation of
dialogue between IDPs and their host communities.

CIVILIANS LIVING NEAR THE CONTACT LINE
Continued ceasefire violations, including the use of heavy
weapons, resulted in loss of life, particularly of persons living
near the contact line; this was exacerbated by the sides
firing from and into residential areas. As of 31 December
2017, the SMM corroborated over 470 civilian casualties
(about 80 killed and about 390 injured), including over 40
children. About one-third of the casualties were caused by
mines and other explosive devices.
Freedom of movement of civilians remained curtailed, with
only five entry-exit checkpoints (EECP) open along the
contact line. Tens of thousands of people passed through
these EECPs on a daily basis to meet family members or
buy supplies such as food and medicine. In the Luhansk
region, near Stanytsia Luhanska, there is only one EECP
for pedestrians, where civilians cross deteriorating wooden
ramps of a broken bridge. After repeated calls by the
Mission, essential repairs were carried out on

SECURITY RISKS
In late April, the Mission suffered the most serious security
incident since its inception: an explosion, most likely
caused by an anti-tank mine, killed a member of an SMM
patrol and injured two others. Following the incident, the
SMM adopted additional security measures requiring its
patrols in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions to use asphalt
or concrete roads only. In addition, the Mission’s freedom
of movement continued to be restricted, due to denial of
access, direct threats to monitors and the presence of
mines and unexploded ordnance, among others.
MEANS OF REMOTE OBSERVATION
Given the restrictions to the SMM’s freedom of movement
and other impediments to the fulfilment of its mandate,
the Mission continued to employ a range of technology,
including unmanned aerial vehicles and other remote
observation technology, and to install camera systems
in hotspots and disengagement areas. This allowed the

9 and 10 December to replace the bridge’s broken ramps.
The SMM also urged the sides to open new EECPs.
While crossing and queuing at the EECPs, civilians were
exposed to the dangers of armed violence. To enhance its
monitoring of the security situation at EECPs, the Mission
installed cameras at the Marinka, Maiorsk and Pyshchevyk
EECPs.
As fighting continued to damage essential civilian
infrastructure, the plight of civilians was often worsened by
interruptions in the supply of basic utilities such as water,
power and gas. The presence of forces and formations
near utility facilities contributed to the risk of damage from
fighting. Of particular concern was the ongoing fighting
around the Donetsk Filtration Station (DFS), since any
substantive damage to the chlorine storage containers at
the facility would result in a serious environmental disaster
and disruption of water supply to hundreds of thousands
of people on both sides of the contact line. The SMM
therefore increased its monitoring capacity by installing a
camera at the DFS and continued to regularly report on
the security situation around the facility.

Many people expressed concerns to the SMM over water
shortages during the summer and lack of heating during
the winter. In 2017, the Mission monitored and facilitated
almost 700 localized ceasefires, or “windows of silence”
co-ordinated by the Joint Centre for Control and
Co-ordination (JCCC), to enable repairs to and
maintenance of over 90 essential infrastructure facilities,
including the DFS. In September, the SMM facilitated and
monitored the successful completion of repairs to the
Toretsk-Horlivka water line, which supplies potable water
to approximately 70,000 people on both sides of the
contact line.
PARTNERSHIPS
The SMM regularly co-operated and shared information
with the United Nations and other international actors
working in the country, such as the ICRC. The Mission
also worked closely with the JCCC, in particular for
reducing tensions and providing security guarantees.

The need to support Ukraine’s accelerating reforms raised the demand for the OSCE
Project Co-ordinator’s help, especially in building consensus among various stakeholders
– the government, the expert community and civil society groups – on the major changes
required to ensure the stable and democratic future of the country. The Co-ordinator
facilitated reform processes and provided valuable international expertise. Assisting
Ukraine in overcoming challenges related to the ongoing crisis was also a focus of the
Office’s efforts.

PROVIDING IMPETUS TO CRUCIAL CHANGES
AT THE TOP ECHELON OF THE JUDICIARY
The Co-ordinator assisted Ukraine in its multi-year effort to
ensure justice and the rule of law and to reform the judiciary,
focusing on the top judicial institutions, the supreme
and higher courts, as well as the legal framework for the
judicial system. It also supported opening the doors of the
Constitutional Court for citizens to seek the protection of
their constitutional rights and freedoms.
The Co-ordinator promoted inclusive expert dialogue in the
process of developing key legislation pieces, particularly
new commercial, civil and administrative procedural codes.
This contributed to their swift adoption by the Parliament
in October 2017. OSCE experts participated in drafting
the recently adopted Law on the Constitutional Court of
Ukraine, which has triggered a constitutional complaint
mechanism, a tool enabling citizens to appeal governmental
acts that abridge human rights and freedoms. These
developments paved the way for the launch of a new
Supreme Court in Ukraine.

THE PROJECT CO-ORDINATOR SUPPORTED:
 the online courses European Mechanism for the
Protection of Human Rights for over 2,000 registered
users and How to Effectively Prepare and Conduct
Dialogue for over 6,500 registered users;
 an induction course for 113 newly elected Supreme
Court judges selected through a competitive
process conducted for the first time in Ukraine;
 a first national sociological survey on
perceived levels of corruption; and
 training of over 600 advocates and over 300 judges
on issues of constitutional and judicial reform.

To help streamline debates on the design, principles and
mode of establishing an anti-corruption court in Ukraine,
and ensure the synergy of international support, an
OSCE-initiated informal working group of international
and national stakeholders developed and documented a
common understanding on basic principles for establishing
a high anti-corruption court in Ukraine. The document
was appreciated highly by the Council of Europe's Venice
Commission in its estimation of anti-corruption court bills.
IMPROVING SOCIAL COHESION THROUGH
DIALOGUE
To further improve and promote people-to-people dialogue
in the country, the Co-ordinator actively supported
youth activities, in particular the Youth Contact Group
initiative. Aiming at challenging stereotypes, building trust
and establishing dialogue, the group’s representatives
conducted over 20 workshops on critical thinking, media
literacy and human rights across Ukraine, also involving
national minorities and internally displaced persons (IDPs).
The Co-ordinator also conducted a series of mediation and
dialogue facilitation events for the IDP shelters in the Lviv
and Kyiv regions. These will serve as a model for dialogues
on matters of concern to IDPs planned for other regions.

first online course on basic skills in conducting dialogue as
a tool for dispute resolution. Over 6,500 people enrolled in
the course in 2017. It was complemented by a series of fourday in-person training sessions for over 160 persons who
had successfully completed the online course, providing
them with intensive training in dialogue competencies.
REVAMPED APPROACH TO THE EDUCATION
OF LEGAL PROFESSIONALS
The Co-ordinator continued working to improve the
quality of legal education, which is a key precondition for
enhancing justice and adherence to the rule of law. To
make the admissions process more fair and transparent,
the Co-ordinator supported the Ministry of Education and
Science in creating a high-quality test database to launch
the country’s first-ever standardized entrance exam at the
master’s degree level in law. The new exam aimed to close
avenues for various types of corruption and bias, to level
the playing field for law school applicants and to ensure that
successful applicants have a basic grasp of fundamental
legal concepts, critical thinking skills and the ability to
communicate in a foreign language. In the 2017/2018
academic year, over 16,000 candidates took the test.

“The road to the new Supreme
Court was not an easy one.
Constitutional amendments, new
legislation on the judicial system,
a complete revision of procedural
codes, a new independent and
transparent system of judicial
government – each of these was
a tremendously difficult but
courageous moved forward. Open, transparent and
competitive selection of candidates to the highest
bench in the country, broadcast live at each step
and stage, rigorously scrutinized by the public, civil
society and the international community, has brought
about a new Supreme Court capable and willing to
reboot the whole judicial system. These achievements
would have been unthinkable without the helping
hand lent by our international partners, including the
OSCE Project Co-ordinator in Ukraine.”

PARTNERSHIPS
To promote synergy in the human dimension, the
Co-ordinator and the CoE exchanged letters of
co-operation. To help establish the Anti-corruption
Court, the Co-ordinator launched a working group
together with the EU Delegation to Ukraine, the CoE,
the European Union Advisory Mission (EUAM) Ukraine,
the EU Anti-Corruption Initiative, the UNDP, the US
Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement

In 2017, the OSCE Project Co-ordinator in Uzbekistan continued to support the host
country’s efforts to address transnational threats, promote transparency in governance, fight
corruption, combat money laundering, and counteract trafficking in human beings and drugs.

COUNTERING TRANSNATIONAL THREATS
The Project Co-ordinator continued its activities in support
of the fight against terrorism, addressing the prevention and
countering of violent extremism and radicalization that lead
to terrorism (VERLT) and the question of how to deal with
the return of foreign terrorist fighters, with a focus on youth
and women.
As part of the OSCE #UnitedCVE social media campaign,
the Project Co-ordinator supported the development of
an informational web portal, a resource tool for individuals,
policymakers, educators, community-based and NGOs
as well as parents and families. The portal aims to prevent
and counter violent extremism and limit the pool of potential
terrorist recruits.
The Project Co-ordinator, together with representatives
from 11 state agencies, reviewed and updated Uzbekistan’s
national action plan for the implementation of UN Security
Council Resolution 1540 (2004).
Jointly with the National Centre on Drug Control, it
supported the implementation of a national anti-drug
programme focused on country-wide preventive measures
to fight illicit trafficking of drugs and chemical precursors.

CYBER/ICT SECURITY
The Project Co-ordinator facilitated the implementation
of the OSCE confidence-building measures to reduce
the risk of conflicts stemming from the use of information
and communication technologies (ICTs), including on the
protection of critical infrastructure, by raising awareness
activities among key national stakeholder agencies. Over
60 officials and experts from six OSCE participating States
took part in a subregional conference on the role of ICTs
in regional and international security organized in Tashkent
and discussed practical measures to enhance cyber
stability between states.
GOOD GOVERNANCE ASSISTANCE
The Project Co-ordinator continued assisting the national
authorities in combating corruption, money laundering and
terrorism financing, as well as in increasing transparency of
government institutions by introducing open government
data principles.
In 2017, public awareness activities promoting zero
tolerance for corruption triggered a significant public
response. Particular attention was paid to projects aimed
at public education institutions – one of the most vulnerable
sectors for corruption.

official website of the Legislative Chamber of the Oliy Majlis
of Uzbekistan. It provides a platform for registering and
processing statistical data on received appeals and for
sending direct answers to appealing citizens, including
journalists.
IMPROVING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF HUMAN
RIGHTS COMMITMENTS
Based on an analysis of newly adopted laws and
regulations, as well as of information provided by state
bodies and human rights monitoring systems, including
on public control over the work of state bodies, the Project
Co-ordinator assisted the National Human Rights Centre in
setting up a road map for state policy on the implementation
of human rights and fundamental freedoms commitments.
It also supported national human rights institutions in
co-ordinating between governmental and nongovernmental organizations, with the aim of developing
quality reporting related to human rights indicators.

ASIAN PARTNERS FOR CO-OPERATION

The OSCE participating States and its Asian Partners
stepped up co-operation in 2017, focusing on common
security challenges and shared priorities with a view to
enhancing the Partners’ involvement in the OSCE’s political
dialogue and activities. Particular attention was paid to the
security situation on the Korean peninsula, the Indo–Pacific
security dynamic, as well as empowering youth to combat
violent extremism. Following up on the recommendations of
the 2014 Basel Ministerial Declaration on Co-operation with
the Asian Partners, the German Chairmanship of the Asian
Contact Group continued to promote a concrete and projectoriented mode of co-operation, which contributed to making
the partnership more demand-driven and operational. The
Asian Partners for Co-operation actively contributed to the
OSCE dialogue and provided significant financial and human
resources to the Organization’s activities for 2017.
To promote sustainable and comprehensive security across
the three OSCE dimensions, the Secretary General and his
team promoted political dialogue with the Asian Partners
for Co-operation through both high-level and informal
consultations, sharing OSCE experiences and best practices.
The Secretary General engaged with the leadership of the
Asian Partners, met with senior government officials from
all five partner states and invited Seoul’s Mayor Park Won
Soon as a guest speaker to contribute an Asian perspective
to the OSCE Security Days event Creating Inclusive,
Safe and Sustainable Cities: Local Approaches to Global
Challenges. He held opening remarks and moderated a
high-level political segment entitled “Confidence building

MEDITERRANEAN PARTNERS
FOR CO-OPERATION

Thanks to the efforts of the Italian Chairmanship of
the Mediterranean Contact Group, the Mediterranean
partnership received a boost in 2017 and renewed interest
from the OSCE participating States and Partners for
Co-operation. The OSCE Partnership Fund saw
unprecedented extrabudgetary contributions from
the Contact Group Chair and other donors. Contact
Group meetings took place under the umbrella theme
of “a positive agenda” and focused on opportunities,
not only challenges. New topics brought to the fore
included the protection of the common cyberspace and
the preservation of the Mediterranean cultural heritage.
Economic and environmental issues were prominently
featured, in particular the transition to renewable energy
and the role that small and medium-sized enterprises can
play in fostering growth and economic security across
the Mediterranean. Issues related to women in peace
and security were discussed during several OSCE events
involving the partners, with a view to enhancing the role
of women mediators in the Mediterranean region. A
particularly positive development was the concrete followup provided to some of the Contact Group meetings
through extrabudgetary projects.

Throughout the year, representatives of the Mediterranean
Partners for Co-operation were involved in a large number
of OSCE Secretariat-designed workshops specifically
tailored to their needs. The 2017 Mediterranean Conference
in Palermo drew the highest-level attendance on record
and re-focused attention on the crucial issue of migration
governance. The Secretary General re-confirmed the
OSCE’s commitment to its Mediterranean dimension,
advocating a more strategic approach to the Mediterranean
Partners for Co-operation, including through multi-year
programmes and commitments.
The Track II New-Med (New Mediterranean) network
continued to promote out-of-the-box thinking about
Mediterranean co-operation. It delivered a number of
research products supporting OSCE ongoing discussions,
and carried out new initiatives on Mediterranean youth
empowerment, including by providing awards to a selected
group of emerging thinkers and leaders.

combating trafficking in human beings. The two annual
meetings of the CoE-OSCE Co-ordination Group remained
an established format for jointly examining issues of mutual
interest. The Group supported high-level interaction and
joint activities by the two organizations and called for
sustained future co-operation. The Group exchanged
information to make full use of the respective strengths of
both organizations pertaining to action against terrorism.
It also encouraged stronger OSCE-CoE interaction in
addressing minority-related issues, in particular in relation
to the integration of diverse societies. Political contacts
intensified thanks to the continuation of the well-established
practice of special briefings that share the priorities of the
respective Chairmanships.
EUROPEAN UNION (EU)
In 2017, the institutional relations between
the OSCE Secretariat and the EU focused
on a number of key issues of mutual interest. From a

opportunity for comparing notes on issues of common
concern, with a special focus on the conflict cycle. On
18 October, the first trilateral UN–EU–OSCE staff talk
took place at the director level. These talks were aimed
to strengthen the mutually reinforcing relationship existing
between the three organizations, while recognizing each
organization’s specific role, competence and particular
strengths, as well as to fully exploit the potential of their
complementarity on the ground.
NORTH ATLANTIC TREATY
ORGANIZATION (NATO)
Interaction between NATO and the OSCE
developed steadily in 2017, through both highlevel visits and contacts at the expert level. Ambassador
Florian Raunig, Head of the Task Force for the 2017
Austrian OSCE Chairmanship, together with Ambassador
Christian Strohal, Special Representative for the Austrian
Chairmanship, visited NATO’s headquarters on 22 February
and addressed the North Atlantic Council. The Secretary
