           REPORT ON THE ACTIVITIES OF THE UNION AND ITS ORGANS
                FOR THE PERIOD JANUARY TO DECEMBER 2018


A.    INTRODUCTION

      I.    Preliminary Remarks

1.     On behalf of the Commission and the other African Union (AU) Organs and
Specialized Agencies, I have the honour, as the Chairperson of the Commission, to
present the Annual Report on the Activities of the Union and Its Organs for the
period of January to December 2018, pursuant to the decision of the Executive Council
EX.CL./Dec.943(XXX) of January 2017.

2.     During the year under review, in addition to their own mandated activities, the
Commission and other AU Organs and Specialized Agencies were fully engaged in
assisting Member States in the implementation of the Union’s Agenda 2063 and, in
particular, the flagship projects identified under the First Ten-Year Implementation Plan
(FTYIP) and the Medium Term Plan 2018-2023 (MTP), as adopted by the Executive
Council in June 2018 [EX.CL./Dec.1008(XXXIII)].

3.     Pursuant to the directives of the Policy Organs, the report is designed in a way
that highlights strengthened cooperation, coordination and synergy among the Union’s
various organs with an emphasis on outcomes or results achieved and their impact on
improving its work and the lives of African people. This design is in line with the policy
requiring the Union’s Organs and Specialized Agencies to deliver on AU reforms and
accelerate the implementation of continental frameworks and mandates relating to
Agenda 2063’s FTYIP.

4.     As of this reporting, the Commission’s departments and autonomous units,
including the African Peer Review Mechanism (APRM) and the NEPAD Planning and
Coordination Agency (hereafter the NEPAD Agency), have aligned their reporting
obligations with the FTYIP’s milestones and deliverables. Consultations took place with
the Regional Economic Communities (RECs) and other AU Organs and Specialized
Agencies during the FTYIP’s preparation phases. Work is now under way, pursuant to
Assembly decision Assembly/AU/Dec.588(XXVI) of January 2016, to ensure that all AU
Organs internalize and align their respective programmes with Agenda 2063’s FTYIP. It
is expected to be finalized after the conclusion of the First Mid-Year Coordination
Meeting of the Bureau of the Assembly and the RECs in June-July 2019.

5.      During the period under review, continental integration remained a key driver in
realizing the Africa We Want and delivering on sustainable development and the
prosperity of African citizens. The Commission also embarked on the institutional reform
process in preparation for the Assembly’s extraordinary Summit of November 2018,
while working strenuously to meet the deadline for silencing the guns by the year 2020.
The preparation and approval of the Union’s budget for the year 2019 saw marked
improvements, thanks largely to the oversight exercised by the Committee of Ministers
of Finance during the process.

                                                                         EX.CL/1134(XXXIV)
                                                                                    Page 2


6.     During the course of the year, the Union continued to face a multitude of
challenges, some of which are highlighted in the Introductory Note of the Chairperson of
the Commission to this report. Two such challenges are noteworthy: the very low rate of
implementation of the decisions and policies of the Union, and equally, the slow
disbursement of assessed contributions.

       II.   Highlights of Activities and Main Achievements

7.     The following section highlights some of the key results achieved by the
Commission, other AU Organs, Specialized Agencies and Representational Missions
during the year under review.

8.      Forty-nine (49) Member States signed the African Continental Free Trade Area
(AfCFTA) Agreement, and sixteen (16) have ratified it. As at the end of 2018, the
following nine (9) Member States deposited their instruments of ratifications: Chad, Côte
d’Ivoire, Ghana, Guinea, Kenya, Rwanda, Niger, Eswatini and Uganda. Furthermore,
the national assemblies of the remaining seven (7) Member States ratified but the
instruments of ratification have yet to be deposited. They are the Republic of Congo,
Mali, Mauritania, Namibia, Sierra Leone, South Africa and Togo. Of the remaining six
Member States that have still to sign the AfCFTA Agreement – Benin, Botswana,
Eritrea, Guinea Bissau, Nigeria and Zambia – one (1) promised to do so in the margins
of the February 2019 Summit, and three were still conducting national consultations.
Meanwhile, the Commission was consulting the remaining two (2) on how to facilitate
their signatures as soon as possible. Twenty-two (22) ratifications are required for the
AfCFTA Agreement to enter into force by the deadline of July 2019. As of December
2018, only six (6) ratifications remained to achieve this historic and significant milestone
towards African integration.

9.     The AU Development/NEPAD Agency established the Traffic Light System at
four pilot One Stop Border Posts that connect five countries, namely Botswana, the
Democratic Republic of the Congo, South Africa, Zambia and Zimbabwe. This system is
aimed to facilitate continental integration and regional trade. Botswana, Zambia and
Zimbabwe have domesticated this system.

10.     Thirty-two (32) Member States signed the Protocol on Free Movement of
Persons, the Right of Residence and Right of Establishment, but only one – Rwanda –
ratified it. The threshold of fifteen (15) ratifications is required for its entry into force.

11.   Only twenty-eight (28) Member States have joined the Single African Air
Transport Market.

12.     On the whole, implementation of the flagship projects moved at a different pace.
Three flagship projects – the AfCFTA, the Free Movement of Persons and, to some
extent, the SAATM – achieved significant progress as judged by the number of Member
States that have signed or joined them. Two others – the Africa Integrated High Speed
Railway Network and Silencing the Guns by 2020 – were on track. However, there was
very little or no progress at all on the remaining flagship projects.

                                                                       EX.CL/1134(XXXIV)
                                                                                  Page 3


13.   The Commission modernized its cybersecurity infrastructure and capacity and
set up an IT Emergency Prevention, Preparedness and Recovery mechanism to deter
and respond to cybersecurity threats.

14.    The Assembly’s extraordinary Summit of November 2018 adopted decisions on
several substantive issues relating to AU institutional reform, including on the structure
of the Commission, the mandate of the newly established AU Development Agency
and, more importantly, on financing the Union.

15.    Implementation of the decision of the 2015 Sandton Summit on financing the
Union is also moving apace. Twenty-four (24) Member States were at different phases
of domesticating the AU import levy. Among them, fourteen (14) were collecting the levy
and all but two have paid their assessed contributions through the new system. In
addition, Member States’ contributions to the Peace Fund amounted to US$80.4 million.

16.    The new program and budget processes achieved a 12% decrease in the 2019
budget compared to 2018, allowing the elimination of wastages and overbudgeting,
addressing the issue of low execution rates and strengthening compliance with AU
financial rules and regulations.

17.   As part of its efforts to expand its revenue base, the Commission collected from
January to November 2018 the amount of US$844,629 through renting its facilities.
Costs have also been cut through the acquisition of state-of-the-art equipment for
conference management and the commissioning of infra-red wireless conference
system.

18.     In recognition of its expertise in vaccine quality testing, the Pan African Vaccine
Centre (PANVAC) was conferred the International Standard Organization (ISO) 17025
Certification by the Ethiopian National Accreditation Organization, placing PANVAC
among world-class laboratories.

19.    Assistance to Member States and the RECs in developing aflatoxin control plans,
mainstreaming them in national plans and advancing food safety more generally yielded
encouraging results. With the support of the Partnership for Aflatoxin Control in Africa
(PACA) and financial assistance from AU partners, some Member States increased
funding for their national aflatoxin control plans. The Commission organized the 3rd
PACA Partnership Platform Meeting in Dakar in October 2018 in the presence of the
Prime Minister of Senegal and the Chairperson of the Commission. In February 2019,
the Commission, jointly with FAO and WHO, will be hosting an International Food
Safety Conference in Addis Ababa.

20.    Progress was made through the Inter-African Phytosanitary Council (IAPSC) in
strengthening Member States’ phytosanitary capacities to prevent the introduction and
spread of pests and coordinating their efforts for the control of the Fall Army worm.

21.    Climate change remains of concern to the Union. The accreditation of the
NEPAD Agency to the Global Climate Fund was on track. The process will take another
one or two years before its successful completion.

                                                                                Page 4


22.  The Campaign to end child marriage gained momentum. As a result of the
Commission’s advocacy efforts, twenty-four (24) Member States have launched their
campaigns to end child marriage and other harmful practices.

23.    Work also continued to promote and safeguard maternal, newborn and child
health through the implementation of the Campaign on Accelerated Reduction of
Maternal Mortality in Africa (CARMMA). Fifty (50) Member States had launched the
CARMMA campaign and started its implementation. The Commission was also actively
engaged in the elimination of Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) in Africa, under the
leadership of President Roch Marc Christian Kabore of Burkina Faso and in partnership
with the U.N. The Commission planned to launch the AU Continental Campaign to End
FGM in the margins of the February 2019 Summit, with the goal to eliminate this
horrible practice in Africa by 2030.

24.     The Maputo Protocol on the Rights of Women has so far gathered forty-one (41)
ratifications. The Commission intensified the campaign for the Maputo Protocol’s
ratification and domestication by all Member States.

25.    The AU Youth Volunteer Corps gained in visibility and interest. 156 youth
volunteers served in the second quarter of 2018, of which 58.4% were female and
41.6% male. On its part, the Pan African University continued to grant advanced
degrees in its three institutes. On the whole, of the total student population of 860 in
2018, approximately 29% are female and over 70% male. For the 2018-2019 academic
year, the Pan African University is committed to raise the number of female students to
at least 40%. Meanwhile, its rectorate has been officially relocated to Yaoundé.

26.     Member States made notable progress in the implementation of the Programme
for Infrastructure Development in Africa (PIDA) projects. The following results were
achieved in 2018:

      (i)   Approximately 16,066 kilometers of road were built throughout the
            continent;
      (ii) 4,077 kilometers of railway capacity were built;
      (iii) A total transmission line capacity of approximately 3,056 kilometers was
            added;
      (iv) Seventeen countries were connected with regional fibre optic cables in the
            Information, Communication and Technology (ICT) sector; and
      (v) 112,900 jobs were created directly and 49,400 jobs indirectly through
            constructed and operational PIDA projects.

27.   The Assembly adopted several legal instruments in 2018, including:

      (i) the Statute of the Trust Fund for Victims of Hissène Habré;
      (ii) the Statute of the African Institute for Remittances;
      (iii) the Protocol to the Treaty establishing the African Economic Community
            relating to Free Movement of Persons, Right of Residence and Right of
            Establishment;
-----------------------Page 7 End-----------------------

                                                                      EX.CL/1134(XXXIV)
                                                                                 Page 5

      (iv) the Protocol to the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights on
           Persons with Disability in Africa;
      (v) the Statute of the African Space Agency; and
      (vi) the Agreement Establishing the African Continental Free Trade Area, its
           Protocols and Annexes.

28.    Pursuant to the Executive Council’s decision EX.CL/Dec.193 (VII), the
Commission embarked on the alignment of the recently adopted legal instruments to
ensure that the texts of the treaties were harmonised in all the working languages. The
Commission’s Office of the Legal Counsel made certified copies available to Member
States to facilitate the ratification/accession process.

29.     The Commission registered a total of one hundred and eight (108) signatures in
2018. As at the end of November 2018, the Office of the Legal Counsel had registered a
total of one hundred and thirty-six (136) signatures of various treaties and forty (40)
ratifications – including seven (7) for the Agreement establishing the African Continental
Free Trade Area – thus surpassing the total of eighteen (18) received in 2017. The
Office of the Legal Counsel also initiated the process for registration of OUA/AU treaties
with the UN Secretariat. Eleven (11) treaties were due to be registered by the end of
2018.

30.    During the commemoration of the AU Law Week and the Treaty Signature Week
in December 2018 [EX.CL/Dec.459(XIV)], the Commission encouraged Member States
to keep the current treaty signing momentum and, more importantly, to implement the
treaties they have ratified, so as to demonstrate their commitment in advancing the
Union’s agenda to improve the lives of the African people.

31.    The Commission continued to ensure that relations with non-African States and
other organizations foster the Union’s best interests and are conducted in accordance
with the Criteria for Granting Observer Status as adopted by the Executive Council in
July 2005 [EX.CL./Dec.230(VII)].

32.    The Commission received requests for accreditation from eleven (11) non-
African States and four (4) regional and international organizations. At the end of this
reporting period, the number of non-African States and international organizations
accredited to the Union stood at one hundred and fourteen (114), of which ninety (90)
non-African states and twenty-four (24) regional and international organizations.

33.    Eleven (11) Member States held presidential and parliamentary elections in
2018. The Commission dispatched long and short-term observation teams for all the
elections. Overall, there was a notable improvement in election management. However,
incidents of electoral violence and contestations of election results remained high in
some places.

34.   In order to better address the medical needs of the AU staff and African
diplomats and their families, the Commission upgraded the AU healthcare delivery
system at AU headquarters and initiated the acquisition of the newest medical
equipment. The Commission also enhanced medical care to AU personnel serving in

                                                                      EX.CL/1134(XXXIV)
                                                                                 Page 6

AU peace support operations. Better disability and death assessment was arranged for
AMISOM and MISCA personnel.

35.    Lastly, the Ethics Office continued to enhance accountability in the Commission
and other AU Organs and Specialized Agencies through, among others, the
implementation of the African Union Code of Conduct and other relevant AU rules, such
as the harassment and whistle-blower policies, as well as raising awareness among AU
elected officials and staff about their rights and responsibilities in accordance with AU
values.

B.    UPDATE ON FLAGSHIP PROJECTS

36.     The Assembly, in its decision Assembly/AU/Dec.565(XXIV) of January 2015,
identified twelve flagship projects as part of Agenda 2063’s FTYIP. This section
provides a status report on their implementation as at the end of the year 2018.

      I.    African Commodity Strategy

37.    The Executive Council’s Ministerial Retreat, which was held in Bahir Dar,
Ethiopia, in January 2014, recommended the development of a commodity strategy to
address price volatility in the commodities sector, as well as spur commodities-based
industrialization through value addition.

38.    During the year under review, the Commission developed a draft AU Commodity
Strategy that addresses challenges in three main commodities sectors, namely
agriculture, mining, and energy. The draft Commodity Strategy also identifies the
following four strategic pillars: (i) commodity markets and pricing; (ii) linkages and
diversification; (iii) governance and enabling environment; and (iv) skills development
and research and development. The pillars will help guide the optimal use of African
commodities through sustainable industrialization, economic diversification, structural
transformation, development and enhanced trade.

39.     The draft Commodity Strategy also proposes the establishment of a Secretariat
that would be hosted in the Commission’s Department of Trade and Industry and work
in collaboration with other stakeholders.

40.   The draft Commodity Strategy and its Action Plan will be submitted for the
consideration of the Policy Organs at the February 2019 Summit.

      II.   African Continental Free Trade Area

41.   The Agreement establishing the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA)
was signed in Kigali on 21 March 2018 during the 10th Extraordinary Session of the
Assembly of Heads of State and Government. The AfCFTA Agreement includes (i) the
Protocol on Trade in Goods; (ii) the Protocol on Trade in Services; and (iii) the Protocol
on Rules and Procedures on the Settlement of Disputes.
-----------------------Page 9 End-----------------------

                                                                      EX.CL/1134(XXXIV)
                                                                                 Page 7

42.    As requested by the Kigali extraordinary Summit of March 2018
[Ext./Assembly/AU/Dec.1(X)], the Commission submitted, for adoption, to the Assembly
at the June-July 2018 Summit in Nouakchott, nine (9) Annexes to the Protocol on Trade
in Goods, comprising: (i) Annex 1 on Schedules of Tariff Concessions; (ii) Annex 2 on
Rules of Origin; (iii) Annex 3 on Customs Cooperation and Mutual Administrative
Assistance; (iv) Annex 4 on Trade Facilitation; (v) Annex 5 on Non-Tariff Barriers; (vi)
Annex 6 on Technical Barriers to Trade; (vii) Annex 7 on Sanitary and Phytosanitary
Measures; (viii) Annex 8 on Transit ; and (ix) Annex 9 on Trade Remedies.

43.     The Commission also submitted to the Nouakchott Summit, for adoption, three
Annexes to the Protocol on Rules and Procedures on the Settlement of Disputes,
namely (i) Annex 1 on Working Procedures of the Panel; (ii) Annex 2 on Expert Review;
and (iii) Annex 3 on Code of Conduct for Arbitrators and Panelists.

44.    Furthermore, the Assembly, in its decision Assembly/AU/Dec.692(XXXI) of June-
July 2018, adopted the list of five priority sectors on trade in services, including the
sectors of transport, communication, finance, tourism and business services.

45.     The Assembly also directed the AU Ministers responsible for Trade to complete
all outstanding work on Phase 1 negotiations and submit the outcomes to the Assembly
at the February 2019 Summit. This includes (i) the Schedules of Specific Commitments
on Trade in Services; (ii) the finalization of Annex 1 of the Protocol on Trade in Goods
dealing with the Schedules of Tariff Concessions; and (iii) the Annexes on Trade
Remedies and Rules of Origin. The Assembly also directed that Phase 2 negotiations
related to investment, intellectual property rights and competition policy be concluded by
January 2020.

46.   As of this reporting, forty-nine (49) countries have signed the AfCFTA
Agreement. The remaining six are Benin, Botswana, Eritrea, Guinea Bissau, Nigeria
and Zambia. Of the remaining six Member States that have still to sign the AfCFTA
Agreement, one (1) promised to do so in the margins of the February 2019 Summit, and
three were still conducting national consultations. Meanwhile, the Commission was
consulting the remaining two (2) on how to facilitate their signatures as soon as
possible.

47.    The status of the AfCFTA’s ratifications at the end of this reporting period was as
follows: nine (9) Member States ratified and deposited their instruments of ratification.
They are Chad, Côte d’Ivoire, Ghana, Guinea, Kenya, Rwanda, Niger, EswatiniEswatini
and Uganda. Furthermore, the national assemblies of the other seven (7) Member
States ratified but the instruments of ratification have yet to be deposited. They are the
Republic of Congo, Mali, Mauritania, Namibia, Sierra Leone, South Africa and Togo.
Twenty-two (22) ratifications are required for the AfCFTA Agreement to enter into force
by the deadline of July 2019. As of December 2018, only six (6) ratifications remained to
achieve this historic and significant milestone towards African integration.

48.    In line with the Assembly’s decision Assembly/AU/Dec.394(XVIII) of January
2012, the Commission continued implementation of the programs and activities on
boosting intra-African trade and fast tracking the establishment of a Continental Free
-----------------------Page 10 End-----------------------

                                                                        EX.CL/1134(XXXIV)
                                                                                   Page 8

Trade Area under the seven clusters of the Action Plan for Boosting Intra African Trade.
To this end, the Commission, in partnership with the Common Market for Eastern and
Southern Africa (COMESA), organized the First African Union Meeting on
Strengthening Trade Policy Dialogue Platforms in Lusaka in September 2018. Similar
activities are scheduled to take place with other RECs in 2019.

49.     The Commission worked with Afreximbank to establish a Pan African Payment
and Settlement Platform which will support customer transfers and interbank transfers
for trade and retail payments using mobile/wallet, internet and web gateways. These
tools will facilitate payments and money transfers for cross-border trade and investment.
The launch is planned for 2019 with an initial set of countries. Also, in collaboration with
Afreximbank, the Commission’s Department of Trade and Industry organized in Cairo in
December 2018, the First Intra-African Trade Fair (IATF) with three segments:
exhibition, conference and a virtual fair trade. The 2018 IATF was one of the first major
deliverables of the AfCFTA.

50.     The Commission, through the Department of Economic Affairs, developed a
comprehensive database on trade statistics in Africa (AFRICATRADE). The database
will be instrumental in the monitoring and evaluation of the AfCFTA, Boosting Intra-
African Trade and implementation of the 0.2% import levy to finance the Union.
AFRICATRADE has the series of trade data for all the Member States from 2005 to
date. The 2017 edition covered the period from 2005 to 2011. It also shows the trends
of Intra-African Trade and the trade flows between Africa and the rest of the world.

      III.   Protocol on Free Movement of Persons and Efforts on Free Movement
             of Goods

51.    A recent study by the African Development Bank (AfDB) on visa regimes in Africa
reveals that Africa is closed to Africans while it is wide open to nationals of other
continents, in particular Europeans and North Americans. The studies show that
Africans need visas to travel to over half of the Union’s Member States. They can get
visas on arrival in a quarter of them, but don’t need a visa to travel to only ten African
countries. In contrast, North Americans are required to obtain a visa prior to travel to
45% of African countries. They can get visa on arrival in 35% of African countries and
don’t need a visa in 20% of African countries.

52.    This paradoxical situation presents African citizens with a double jeopardy. On
the one hand, they are unable to travel freely in their own continent. On the other hand,
as the tide of racism, xenophobia and narrow-national populism gathers momentum,
continents such as Europe and North America are closing their borders to African
citizens under the guise of containing illegal migrants.

53.    Since     the   adoption     by    the    Assembly      in    January     2018
[Assembly/AU/Dec.676(XXX)] of the Protocol to the Treaty Establishing the African
Economic Community Relating to Free Movement of Persons, Right of Residence and
Right of Establishment and Its Implementation Roadmap, thirty-two (32) Member States
have signed the Protocol but only one – Rwanda – has ratified it. The Commission
embarked on a popularization campaign with the aim to secure, within a short period of
-----------------------Page 11 End-----------------------

                                                                        EX.CL/1134(XXXIV)
                                                                                   Page 9

time, the fifteen (15) ratifications required for the Protocol’s entry into force. Universal
ratification is nonetheless the ultimate objective, along with the domestication by all
Member States and implementation of this landmark instrument in full and without
reservations.

54.    Part of the ratification campaign targeted the two RECs that are ahead in this
area, namely the East African Community (EAC) and the Economic Community of West
African States (ECOWAS). While not ignoring the other RECs, the Commission
organized a joint EAC-ECOWAS consultation in Dakar in October 2018 to encourage
the two RECs to sensitize their members on the need to accelerate the ratification of the
Protocol. Taken together, the membership of EAC and ECOWAS amounts to twenty-
one (21) countries, of which six for the EAC and 15 for ECOWAS.

55.    There is currently an encouraging move among Member States to relax visa
regimes for Africans, with Ethiopia, Kenya and Namibia as the latest Member States to
relax their entry visa regimes. Two (2) Member States – Benin and Seychelles – do not
require visas to Africans, while the following seventeen (17) grant visas on arrival: Cabo
Verde, the Comoros, Djibouti, the Gambia, Ghana, Guinea Bissau, Kenya, Madagascar,
Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, Rwanda, Senegal, Somalia, Tanzania, Togo and
Zimbabwe. However, abolition of visa requirements for Africans is essential to facilitate
the right of entry as the first phase of the Protocol.

56.    The Protocol also provides for the issuance of the African Passport. During the
period under review, the Commission convened in Nairobi in June 2018, a meeting of
the Chiefs of Immigration from all Member States to develop the guidelines for the
design, production and issuance of the African Passport. The guidelines were adopted
by the Specialized Technical Committee (STC) on Migration, Refugees and Internally
Displaced Persons and Returnees in Malabo at the end of October and beginning of
November 2018. They will be submitted to the February 2019 Summit and, once
adopted by the Assembly, will clear the way for Member States to begin issuing African
Passports to their citizens.

57.    The Commission, in collaboration with the International Organization for
Migration (IOM), the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) and the
Republic of Djibouti, launched the 4th Pan African Forum on Migration (PAFOM) in
Djibouti in November 2018 under the theme Harnessing the benefits of Free Movement
of persons regime for sustainable development in Africa. Participants focused on the
achievements and challenges of free movement of persons regimes and the urgency to
promote effective labour mobility governance in Africa. On their part, Member States
representatives noted the importance of cooperation among neighbouring countries as
key to create stronger border regimes and emphasized the need for a balanced view of
migration to ensure both development and security.

58.    In support of regional and continental integration, with a particular focus on
movement of people and goods (MoveAfrica), the NEPAD Agency operationalized in
June 2018 the Traffic Light System (TLS) at four (4) pilot One Stop Border Posts
(OSBPs) – Beit Bridge, Chirundu, Kasumbalesa and Kazungula – that connect five
countries, namely Botswana, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, South Africa,
Zambia and Zimbabwe.
-----------------------Page 12 End-----------------------

                                                                       EX.CL/1134(XXXIV)
                                                                                 Page 10


59.     The Traffic Light System comprises nine indicators focused on: cross border road
transport permits; visas for professional drivers and crews of road vehicles; bond
acquittal process; transit guarantees; vehicle insurance for drivers; vehicle weights/load
- (overload control); cross border facilitation arrangements; infrastructure and level of
infrastructure for freighters and trucks; and health and safety.

60.    The NEPAD Agency conducted the first OSBP assessment at Chirundu in
September 2018, in partnership with COMESA, the Zambia Revenue Authority (ZRA)
and the Zimbabwe Revenue Authority (ZIMRA). The assessment indicated that
Chirundu is currently rated as yellow, which indicates some relatively improved
performance. Botswana, Zambia and Zimbabwe have domesticated TLS indicators for
expected better performance. MOVEAFRICA’s ultimate goal is to reduce trade barriers
in view of creating jobs and competitiveness as less logistics cost will make goods
competitive and increase intra-African trade, therefore jobs.

      IV.   African Virtual University

61.     The Pan-African Virtual and e-University (PAVEU) aims to accelerate the
development of human capital, science and technology and innovation through
increasing access to tertiary and continuing education in Africa by capitalizing on the
digital revolution and global knowledge and consolidating African initiatives and
strategies on accelerated development of human capital, as well as science, technology
and innovation. In addition to the core learning objectives, the eLearning platform is
aimed to expose African students to the emerging technologies on the internet and help
them acquire communication skills that are critical in today’s world.

62.   The Commission completed the development of the PAVEU’s progress
implementation framework. The framework includes guidelines on the Institute’s
management structures, staffing and potential partnerships with other role players.

63.    The Commission was advised to provide cloud hosting services for the Pan-
African Virtual and e-University. Investing in this technology will help reduce costs by
removing the need for turnaround maintenance, replacement of outdated technological
investment and large number of staff to manage the existing structures. However, a
network and infrastructure that is robust enough to support learning resources,
administration and research, as well as accommodate learners in all Member States
and the Diaspora, is required. Currently the PAVEU Rectorate is serviced with a very
limited in-house outreach through a Wi-Fi.

64.    The piloting of two online courses – History of Africa and Gender & Human
Rights – could not be implemented in 2018. More time is required to train the facilitators,
develop a course template, develop multimedia components of the courses, package
the online courses and orient the students to use the recommended Moodle learning
management system.
-----------------------Page 13 End-----------------------

                                                                     EX.CL/1134(XXXIV)
                                                                               Page 11

65.   The Assembly approved the recommendation of the STC on Education, Science
and Technology (STC- EST) about the establishment of the PAVEU as an Institute of
the Pan-African University and its location at the PAU Rectorate Headquarters in
Yaoundé. PAVEU’s acting coordinator also relocated to Yaoundé in August 2018.
PAVEU is a Member of the ICT in Education CESA Cluster. The positions of PAVEU
Coordinator (P5), Instructional Designer (P3) and Senior Educational Technologists
were also advertised. Specifications of office equipment for the Yaoundé office are
under consideration.

      V.    African Economic Platform

66.    The African Economic Platform (AEP) is an annual forum for regular engagement
between the political leadership, business leaders and the private sector, universities
and intellectuals, on the implementation of Agenda 2063 and issues of Africa’s
economic transformation and industrialization. As a follow-up to the Executive Council’s
decision EX.CL/Dec.924(XXIX) of July 2016, the Commission, in partnership with the
Government of Mauritius and with the support of the African Union Foundation,
organized the first forum in Mauritius in March 2017.

67.    The Assembly, in its decision Assembly/AU/Dec.643(XXIX) of July 2017,
approved the offer by the Republic of Mauritius to host the second African Economic
Platform in March 2018, and requested the Commission and the African Union
Foundation to work closely with the host country Mauritius to ensure a successful
second African Economic Platform. However, the African Economic Platform (AEP) did
not take place in 2018 due to challenges regarding the operational and governance
status of the African Union Foundation (AUF).

68.    The Commission has been working with the AUF to resolve these outstanding
matters. Meanwhile, following a proposal by the Government of Mauritius, the AEP
forum for 2019 is tentatively scheduled to take place in May 2019.

      VI.   Continental Monetary and Financial Institutions

69.     The Treaty Establishing the African Economic Community – also known as the
Abuja Treaty – envisioned the establishment of the African Economic and Monetary
Union and the African Central Bank (ACB) as the institution to mint the single African
currency. The AU Constitutive Act added two more institutions, namely the African
Monetary Fund (AMF) and the African Investment Bank (AIB), thus making the three
institutions – the African Central Bank, the African Monetary Fund and the African
Investment Bank – the core financial institutions of the African Union. In addition, the
Assembly, in its decision Assembly/AU/Dec.109(VI) of January 2006, mandated the
Commission to carry out a feasibility study on the establishment of a Pan-African Stock
Exchange (PASE).

70.    Together, the three financial institutions and the Pan African Stock Exchange
constitute the Pan-African Financial Institutions (PAFI).
-----------------------Page 14 End-----------------------

                                                                        EX.CL/1134(XXXIV)
                                                                                  Page 12

                 The African Central Bank

71.     The African Central Bank (ACB) aims to manage monetary and exchange rate
policy in Africa. It will be preceded by the African Monetary Institute, which will lead the
preparatory work for the establishment of the ACB based on a gradual approach.

72.    The Commission and the Association of African Central Banks (AACB) initiated a
study group and a joint strategy and roadmap for the establishment of the African
Central Bank. The strategy was adopted by the Board of Governors of the AACB in
Malabo in August 2015. It was submitted for approval to both the Annual Joint Meeting
of the STC on Finance, Monetary Affairs, Economic Planning and Integration and the
49th Conference of African Ministers of Planning, Finance and Economic Development
of the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UN-ECA), which was held in
Addis Ababa in March-April 2016.

73.    A technical study on the Pan African Stock Exchange was carried out by a team
of consultants in 2012. The outcome was submitted to the Conference of Ministers of
Economy and Finance held in Abuja in March 2014, who recommended that the study
report be submitted to Member States for further review. The study report will be
submitted for the consideration of the STC on Finance, Monetary Affairs, Economic
Planning and Integration in 2019.

74.    To accelerate the establishment of the African Central Bank, the Commission
developed a draft headquarters agreement to be negotiated with the Federal Republic
of Nigeria, the host country, and the Central Bank of Nigeria as the designated
representative of the Nigerian government for the establishment of the African Central
Bank. Once the draft headquarters agreement is concluded, the next step will be the
setting up of the African Monetary Institute in collaboration with the Association of
African Central Banks and in accordance with the recommendations of the joint
strategy.

75.     Meanwhile, the Commission engaged key African Central Bank stakeholders to
advance the African Central Bank agenda. The Commission’s Department of Economic
Affairs attended the meeting of the Technical Committee of the Association of African
Central Banks in Dakar in February 2018 during which the Technical Committee
reaffirmed the Association's commitment to work with the Commission towards the
fulfilment of the continental integration agenda.

76.    The Commission’s Department of Economic Affairs also attended the meeting of
the Assembly of the Association of African Central Banks in Sharm-El-Sheikh in August
2018, to sensitize African Central Bankers on the need for monetary and financial
integration in Africa.

                 The African Monetary Fund

77.  The African Monetary Fund is expected to facilitate the integration of African
economies by abolishing trade restrictions, financing deficits, fostering monetary
-----------------------Page 15 End-----------------------

                                                                      EX.CL/1134(XXXIV)
                                                                                Page 13

cooperation and providing technical assistance to Member States particularly on poverty
and debt reduction strategies.

78.    The African Monetary Fund has still not been operationalized. As of this
reporting, only ten Member States had signed the instruments establishing the African
Monetary Fund. They are Benin, Cameroon, Chad, the Comoros, the Republic of
Congo, Ghana, Guinea-Bissau, Mauritania, Sao Tome and Principe, and Zambia. No
Member State ratified the Fund’s legal instruments.

79.     On its part, the Commission signed in Yaoundé in April 2018, the host country
agreement with the Republic of Cameroon to begin the operation of this institution once
its protocol receives the fifteen (15) ratifications required to enter into force.

                The African Investment Bank

80.    As at December 2018, the following twenty-two (22) Member States had signed
the relevant legal instruments for the African Investment Bank: Angola, Benin, Burkina
Faso, Chad, Côte d’Ivoire, Comoros, the Republic of the Congo, the Democratic
Republic of the Congo, Gabon, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea Bissau, Guinea, Liberia, Libya,
Madagascar, Niger, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Sao Tome and Principe, Togo and Zambia.
However, only five (5) ratified them, namely Benin, Burkina Faso, the Republic of
Congo, Libya, and Togo.

81.     As the Union moves steadily towards the realization of its development and
integration agenda, Member States should do their utmost to ensure that these financial
institutions begin their operations as early as possible. Member States that have signed
and ratified these institutions’ legal instruments should be commended, and all are
urged to accelerate this process. These continental financial institutions not only
strengthen Africa's capacity to assume its financial self-sufficiency, but they will also
help shield Member States from international currency manipulations and the
uncertainties of the global financial markets.

82.    The Commission published in 2018, a book that highlights the main features,
protocols and statutes of the African Investment Bank and the African Monetary Fund.
The publication also discusses the pre-conditions, performances and challenges of the
Regional Economic Communities towards the establishment of the Economic and
Monetary Union, as well as the joint AU-AACB strategy for the establishment of the
African Central Bank.

                The African Multidimensional Regional Integration Index (AMRII)

83.     Over the period under review, the Commission’s Department of Economic
Affairs, in collaboration with experts from the Regional Economic Communities (RECs),
the Association of African Central Banks (AACB) and the Committee of Directors
General (CoDGs) of National Statistical Institutes, carried out a study to develop a
comprehensive and coherent tool of monitoring and evaluation of regional integration in
Africa. Following several technical meetings, the new African Multidimensional Regional
Integration Index (AMRII) was adopted by experts in Kampala in September 2018.
-----------------------Page 16 End-----------------------

                                                                          EX.CL/1134(XXXIV)
                                                                                    Page 14


84.    The AMRII is based on the following regional integration dimensions: (i) free
movement of persons; (ii) political and institutional integration (iii) trade integration; (iv)
social integration; (v) infrastructure integration; (vi) financial integration; (vii) monetary
integration; and (viii) environmental Integration. The Commission plans to submit the
AMRII to the STC on Finance, Monetary Affairs, Economic Planning, and Integration in
Yaoundé in March 2019. The AMRII will subsequently be submitted for the
consideration of the Policy Organs in Niamey in July 2019.

       VII. The Grand Inga Dam

85.    The “Grand Inga Hydropower Project” in the Democratic Republic of Congo
(DRC) is under review following an overall scheme (Inga 3 to Inga 8) that is intended to
reach its full capacity of over 44,000 MW and contribute to electricity supply to the DRC
and to the entire continent.

86.    The selection process of the private developer started in August 2015, but as of
this reporting, only two consortia – China Inga 3 and ProInga – remained in the
competition. On the other hand, the Government of the DRC decided in June 2017 to
change the concept of Inga 3 from the original 4,800 MW to 10,000-12,000 MW
capacity and requested the two remaining consortia to submit a joint optimized project
proposal. This was submitted in June 2018 on the Inga 3’s new concept of 11,000 MW.
The Government of the DRC eventually signed an agreement with the two project
developers in October 2018. The latter has committed to undertake technical studies,
including an assessment of the dam’s environmental and social impact.

87.     It is important to note that the Grand Inga Dam project has faced major
challenges since its inception, including the Government’s lack of technical capacity and
inability to mobilize its own resources as a contribution to the realization of this flagship
project. Notwithstanding these and other challenges, the Commission remains
committed to the operationalization of this flagship project.

88.    The Commission’s financial assistance allowed the DRC Inga Team to take part
in the meeting of the STC Energy Subcommittee in Nouakchott in March 2018. The
STC Energy Subcommittee made two major recommendations, namely (i) the
establishment of a continental coordination arrangement for Inga hydropower project
that will bring together relevant institutions such as RECs, Power Pools and Regulators
under the Commission’s leadership; and (ii) the alignment of all the various agreements
on Inga with interconnection projects that are being planned, i.e. Inga to South Africa
and Inga to Nigeria.

89.    To this end, the Chairperson of the Commission sent a letter to President Joseph
Kabila of the DRC on 5 December 2017 in which he reiterated the AU’s commitment to
the realization of this flagship project and proposed the setting-up of a “Strategic
Committee” (AU Commission-African Development Bank-NEPAD) to support the DRC
for this flagship project. The Chairperson of the Commission also proposed the
presentation by the Government of the DRC of regular reports to AU Summits on
developments on the Inga project, starting in June/July 2018.

                                                                                 Page 15


90.    The Commission has initiated consultations with the Government of the DRC to
secure the concurrence of the authorities to set up a continental coordination
arrangement for the Inga hydropower project, as recommended by the STC
Subcommittee on Energy, and ensure regular reporting to the abovementioned
Subcommittee and AU Summits on the status of implementation of the Grand Inga
project.

91.   Meanwhile, during a consultative meeting between the Commission, the PRC
Committee on the Implementation of Agenda 2063, the RECs and the African
Development Bank, which was held in Nairobi in September 2018, a DRC delegation
made a presentation on the Grand Inga project outlining the status of the project
implementation, the challenges being faced and recommendations on the way forward.

      VIII. Great Museum of Africa

92.    The process of establishing the Great Museum of Africa in Algiers gained
momentum in 2018. As requested by the Executive Council, the Commission worked
with the Government of Algeria and other stakeholders in June 2018 to establish the
Technical and Advisory Committee of the Great Museum of Africa. The Technical and
Advisory Committee held its first meeting in Addis Ababa in June 2018, and another one
in Algiers in December 2018. The Great Museum of Africa is expected to open in 2022
with a continent-wide exhibition.

      IX.   Africa Integrated High-Speed Train Network

93.    The Africa Integrated High Speed Railway Network (AIHSRN) project is a
Commission-led initiative designed to interconnect African capitals, economic and other
industrial hubs and major tourism locations with appropriate high-speed rail technology,
with other complementary electricity, power and ICT broadband infrastructure and
services.

94.    The Commission finalized the recruitment of the consultancy firm, CPCS
Transcom Ltd JV, which will conduct phase 1 – the detailed scoping study – of the
comprehensive pre-feasibility study of the project. Thereafter, focus will be on mobilizing
substantial resources for a full feasibility study. Meanwhile, the Commission provided
US$400,000 from the 2018 budget to support the NEPAD Agency in the execution of
the detailed scoping study.

95.    The NEPAD Agency has signed the contract with CPCS Transcom Ltd for the
detailed scoping study (DSS). The study will be conducted from January to June 2019.
The NEPAD Agency is also facilitating resource mobilization for the pre-feasibility and
feasibility studies with the development of a financing toolkit.

      X.    Outer Space Strategy

96.     The Assembly, in its decision Assembly/AU/Dec.589(XXVI) of January 2016,
called for further development of a governance structure in addition to evaluating the
legal, structural and financial implications of the proposed African Outer Space Agency.
-----------------------Page 18 End-----------------------

                                                                       EX.CL/1134(XXXIV)
                                                                                 Page 16


97.     The Statute for the African Space Agency was adopted by the Assembly in
January 2018 [Assembly/AU/Dec.676(XXX)]. Thereafter, the Commission finalised the
African Space Agency structural and financial implications study and submitted it for
consideration of the Policy Organs. The Commission launched an institutional
arrangement process by inviting Member States to express their intention to host the
African Outer Space Agency. A high-level panel of space experts was appointed to
finalise the evaluation of the countries that expressed interest to host the African Outer
Space Agency.

98.   The Commission also initiated two surveys that will inform the development of
the earth observation and the navigation and positioning programmes by the African
Space Agency: the first is on the status of the earth observation private sector in Africa,
and the other on the status of navigation and positioning in Africa.

99.    The Commission sponsored the participation of dozens of young engineers and
scientists in the African Space Leadership Conference held in Abuja and the African
Association for Remote Sensing for Environment, held in Alexandria, Egypt.

100. The Commission signed in Brussels in June 2018, a cooperation arrangement
with the European Commission in the area of free data access and use of sentinel data
of the Copernicus programme by all African institutions and citizens. It also publicized
the African Space Policy and Strategy in several international fora.

101. In 2018, the GMES and Africa Support Programme, a component of the African
Outer Space flagship, was co-financed by the European Commission and the AU
Commission to the tune of €29.5 million and €0.5 million, respectively. The GMES
programme aims to use earth observation science and technology to deliver on water
and natural resources service and marine and coastal areas service.

102. As a follow up, the Commission undertook GMES & Africa Due Diligence
missions to implementing consortia with the aim of assessing their institutional
capacities in earth observation, ICT, financial and procurement areas, before the
release of grants. Consortia Lead Countries visited during this period are Botswana, the
Republic of Congo, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Egypt, Gabon, Mauritius and
Namibia.

103. GMES & Africa training and communication strategies have been adopted and
published. Design and development of a geo-portal for GMES & Africa has been
initiated. It will be a permanent tool for monitoring the performance of consortia and
implementation progress of GMES & Africa. Design for the GMES & Africa website has
also been completed with the assistance of the Commission’s Department of
Information and Communication (DIC) and is now operational.

      XI.   The Pan-African e-Network

104. Concerned by the inactivity of this flagship project, the Commission convened the
second Assembly of Parties users of the Pan-African e-Network (PAeN) in Addis Ababa
-----------------------Page 19 End-----------------------

                                                                     EX.CL/1134(XXXIV)
                                                                               Page 17

in December 2018. As requested by the Policy Organs, the meeting identified options
on making use of the PAeN infrastructure for further add-on services, including the pre-
feasibility study on the Pan-African Mass Education TV that was developed by the
Commission. The meeting gathered the representatives of the ten (10) Member States
that utilize the facilities provided by the Network.

105. The report of the Chairperson of the Commission on the sustainability of the Pan-
African e-Network was finalized in May 2018 and submitted for the consideration of the
Assembly of Users in December 2018. The final report will be presented to the STC on
Communication and ICT in November 2019.

106. The Commission has been active in promoting digitalization through the
implementation of various projects, notably the Programme for Infrastructure
Development in Africa (PIDA), the African Internet Exchange Point System (AXIS), the
African Leadership in ICT (ALICT), Policy and Regulation Initiative for Digital Africa
(PRIDA), dotAfrica top level domain name and the implementation of the AU
Convention on Cyber-security and Personal Data Protection.

      XII. Single Africa Air Transport Market (SAATM)

107. The following twenty- eight (28) countries are currently part of SAATM: Benin,
Burkina Faso, Botswana, Cabo Verde, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Republic of
Congo, Côte d’Ivoire, Chad, Egypt, Ethiopia, Gabon, the Gambia, Ghana, Guinea,
Kenya, Lesotho, Liberia, Mali, Mozambique, Niger, Nigeria, Rwanda, Sierra Leone,
South Africa, Eswatini, Togo and Zimbabwe.

108. The regulatory and institutional texts of the Yamoussoukro Decision, which
constitute the regulatory and management framework of the SAATM, were adopted by
January 2018 Summit. The Commission has recruited a consultant to redraft the dispute
settlement mechanism and its institutions.

109. The Ministerial Working Group that was set up to lead SAATM’s establishment
and operationalization held its fourth meeting in Lomé in May 2018. An important
outcome was the adoption of the memorandum of implementation of the Yamoussoukro
Decision, to be signed by all states that join SAATM. The Commission facilitated the
capacity strengthening of the Executing Agency of the Yamoussoukro Decision, the
African Civil Aviation Commission (AFCAC), including the recruitment of its new
Secretary General.

110. The slow pace by Member States to join the SAATM and slow implementation of
the immediate measures remain the greatest challenge to its operationalization.
Member States that have signed and ratified the Agreement establishing the African
Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) are urged to join the SAATM, if they have not
already done so, to enable its operationalization. The liberalization of the African air
transport market will contribute significantly to intra-African trade. On its part, the
Commission continued its advocacy for the SAATM and the mobilization of financial and
technical resources to strengthen the effectiveness of the African Civil Aviation
Commission, which is the Executing Agency.

                                                                                Page 18


      XIII. Silencing the Guns by 2020

111. In line with his coordinating role, the High Representative for Silencing the Guns,
Ramtane Lamamra, organized a two-day workshop in Addis Ababa in March 2018,
which brought together experts and practitioners from institutions active in the
promotion of peace and security in Africa. The workshop’s aim was to reflect on how
best to expedite the operationalization of one of the Union’s flagship projects on
Silencing the Guns in Africa by 2020.

112. Participants discussed peace and security trends on the continent, including
traditional threats such as violent extremism and terrorism, transnational organized
crime, the trafficking of small arms and light weapons, as well as inter-communal
conflicts, but also more recent challenges related to climate change, rapid urbanization
and growing youth unemployment. They also focused their attention on the continent’s
major trans-regional conflict complexes in the Sahel (including the Lake Chad Basin),
North Africa, the Great Lakes Region and the Horn of Africa (including South Sudan).

113. The workshop underlined two major imperatives to silencing the guns on the
continent. First is the need to concentrate, even more than in the past, on the
prevention of violent conflicts and strengthen the Union’s efforts towards structural
prevention of conflict. In this regard, participants expressed concern about the
increased use of military might to resolve conflicts. Second is the urgent need for
African leaders, at all levels, to demonstrate strong personal commitment in pushing for
peace. In this context, participants welcomed the visionary leadership that led recently
to an end of some of the continent’s protracted regional conflicts, notably in the Horn of
Africa, following the rapprochement between Ethiopia and Eritrea.

114. There was also a consensus that political legitimacy and governmental
accountability to its citizens must be enhanced to realize the ambitious goal of silencing
the guns in Africa by 2020. Good governance was thus identified as the single most
important asset not only for the promotion of peace, security and political stability, but
also inclusive development.

115. The AU High Representative for Silencing the Guns in Africa undertook a mission
to the Comoros in September 2018, to support the dialogue between the Comorian
parties. The visit was a follow-up to a meeting in Beijing in September 2018 between
the President of the Union of the Comoros, Azali Assoumani, and the Chairperson of
the Commission. He also travelled to Madagascar in September 2018, as part of the
AU's efforts to assist the Republic of Madagascar in preparation of the 2018 presidential
elections. The successful holding of presidential elections and the acceptance by all the
Malagasy parties of the decision of the High Constitutional Court marked a major
advance towards the promotion of democracy and the settlement of electoral disputes
through constitutional means. The AU High Representative also continued to assist the
peace initiatives undertaken by the AU High Level Implementation Panel (AUHIP) and
IGAD High Level Revitalization Forum in Sudan and South Sudan, respectively.

                                                                                 Page 19

116. As part of its efforts to implement Article 17 of the African Youth Charter (2006),
which urges the active engagement and collaboration with youth on peace and security,
the Commission convened a Maiden Consultative Meeting in Lagos in November 2018,
with youth organizations working on peace and security. The meeting was held with the
objective of defining modalities and implementation strategies for the engagement of
youth organizations in conflict prevention and feed their efforts into the Commission’s
Framework for Youth in Peacebuilding. On its part, the Peace and Security Council
convened an open session on youth, peace and security in Africa in November 2018,
and decided to hold such session annually as a way of involving the African youth in
peace efforts.

117. In collaboration with the RECs, the Commission’s Department of Peace and
Security continued its efforts towards developing the Silencing the Guns Continental
Plan of Action on small arms and light weapons, which seeks to translate into action the
arms control priorities contained in the AU Master Roadmap. The West and East Africa
chapters were validated in May and November 2018, respectively. Finally, the
Department of Peace and Security completed the continental mapping study on illicit
arms flows, which was validated by experts in September 2018. The study will be
presented to the Peace and Security Council in early 2019.

118. Within the framework of the African Union’s Continental Structural Conflict
Prevention Framework (CSCPF) that was endorsed by the Peace and Security Council
in 2015, the Commission launched its pilot Country Structural Vulnerability and
Resilience Assessment (CSVRA) and Country Structural Vulnerability Mitigation
Strategy (CSVMS) report of the Republic of Ghana in October 2018. Ghana’s
pioneering role in this exercise needs to be replicated by all Member States as part of
the efforts to silence the guns and promote a conflict-free continent.

C.    INSTITUTIONAL REFORMS AND SELF-FINANCING

119. The Assembly in its decision on the AU institutional reform
Assembly/AU/Dec.635(XXVIII) of January 2017, sets out a comprehensive AU reform
agenda aimed at fundamentally re-positioning the organization to meet the evolving
needs of its Member States and the continent. The reform decision took into account
previous reform proposals, notably the 2007 Adedeji Audit, which made extensive and
far-reaching recommendations on how to improve the overall effectiveness of the Union.
Unfortunately, most of these recommendations were never implemented.

120. To this end, the Assembly identified the following core reform priorities: (i) focus
on key priorities with continental scope; (ii) realign AU institutions in order to deliver
against those priorities; (iii) connect the AU to its citizens; (iv) manage the business of
the AU efficiently and effectively at both the political and operational levels; and (v)
finance the African Union sustainably and with the full ownership of the Member States.

121. More importantly, the Assembly decided to oversee the reform process by
designating President Paul Kagame of Rwanda to supervise the implementation
process. It determined that President Kagame would work with the Reform Troika
comprising the outgoing Chair of the Union for 2016, President Idriss Déby of Chad, and
-----------------------Page 22 End-----------------------

                                                                     EX.CL/1134(XXXIV)
                                                                               Page 20

the incoming Chair of the Union for 2017, President Alpha Conde of Guinea. The
Assembly requested President Kagame to report on progress made in implementing the
reform agenda at each of its ordinary sessions.

122. During the January 2018 Summit, the Assembly decided that, as part of the
process of deepening consultations around the reform implementation process, the
Reform Troika should be expanded to the Bureau of the Assembly of the Union. The
Assembly also decided to establish a group of fifteen (15) Ministers of Foreign Affairs,
three per region, to play an advisory role to the reform process. In Nouakchott in July
2018, the group of Ministers of Foreign Affairs was expanded to twenty (20) members.

123. Significant progress was made in the implementation of the institutional reform.
Key highlights include the following:

          Financing the Union:

124. Following the adoption of the ‘golden rules’ for financial management at the
January 2018 Summit, a credible budget process was put in place as a result of which
the AU 2019 budget was reduced by 12%, compared to the 2018 budget.

125. At the time of this reporting, twenty-five (25) Member States were at various
stages of implementing the 0.2% levy to ensure predictable and autonomous financing
of the Union. In addition, Member States contributed approximately US$80.4million to
the AU Peace Fund.

126. UN Security Council Resolutions 2320 and 2378 on predictable and sustainable
financing of AU-mandated and/or authorized peace support operations also represented
significant progress in delivering on the AU’s long-standing position that AU-led peace
support operations that are authorised by the UN Security Council should be funded by
UN assessed contributions.

          Working Methods of the Policy Organs:

127. From 2019 onwards, there will only be one ordinary Summit a year of the heads
of state and government. A streamlined agenda for the Summit focusing on only three
key strategic issues for the Assembly’s attention was instituted. Furthermore, the
systematic categorisation of decision-making that is already provided for in the
Assembly Rules of Procedure will be instituted starting from 2019, with a view to
improving the overall quality of the decision-making process and enhancing
implementation.

          Gender and Youth Representation:

128. Quotas for women – 50% by 2025 – and the youth – 35% by 2025 – for posts
across the AU were set and recruitment is being undertaken in line with these quotas.
-----------------------Page 23 End-----------------------

                                                                       EX.CL/1134(XXXIV)
                                                                                 Page 21

           Policy Coherence and Division of Labour in the Union:

129. During the period under review, the Chairperson of the Commission established
a joint committee of experts and liaison officers of the different Regional Economic
Communities (RECS) at the AU headquarters to follow up on the implementation of the
various Assembly decisions namely: (i) Assembly/AU/Dec.690(XXXI) of July 2018,
which requested the implementation of the roadmap on the clarification of the division of
labour among the AU, RECs, Member States and continental organizations; (ii)
Assembly/AU/Dec.635(XXVIII) of January 2017, which called for a clear division of
labour and effective collaboration among the AU, the RECs, the Regional Mechanisms
(RMs), the Member States, and other continental institutions, in line with the principle of
subsidiarity; and (iii) Assembly/AU/Dec.112(VII) of July 2006, which urges the RECs to
coordinate and harmonize their policies among themselves and with the Commission
with a view to accelerating Africa’s integration process.

130. The Joint AU Commission-RECS Committee submitted a draft decision on
establishing an effective division of labour between the African Union, Regional
Economic Communities and continental organisations that was adopted by the
Assembly at its 11th extraordinary Summit held in Addis Ababa in November 2018
[Ext/Assembly/AU/Dec.1(XI)].

131. In addition, the Commission, with the technical support of the African Capacity
Building Foundation, carried out three studies on policy coherence and division of
labour in the Union. The first study reviewed the functional roles of all the AU Organs
with a human rights and governance mandate. The aim was to identify entry-points for
the introduction of processes, systems and mechanisms for the improvement of policy
alignment, harmonised budgeting, results-based programme implementation,
monitoring and evaluation, knowledge management, and reporting across these
Organs.

132. The second study examined the relationship between the Commission and
Specialised Agencies. The objective was to (i) create a comprehensive inventory of all
Specialised Agencies; (ii) elaborate a coherent legal definition of a Specialised Agency;
(iii) review a standard set of criteria for the awarding of specialised agency status to
autonomous institutions; (iv) propose a consistent process for the operationalisation of
these Agencies; (v) construct a mapping of division of labour between Specialised
Agencies and relevant departments of the Commission; and (vi) consider possible
funding models to ensure sustainability of these Agencies.

133. In addition, recognising the need to enhance the functional relationship with its
Permanent Representational Offices (PROs), the Commission undertook another study
to assess the strategic and capacity of PROs with a view to designing effective
mechanisms for improved institutional coherence.

134. Work will continue in 2019 towards the implementation of the Assembly’s
decision and the holding of more consultations with all the stakeholders on the issues
and options articulated in the three studies.

                                                                                  Page 22

           Pan-African Parliament and Judicial Organs:

135. The Commission completed an initial review of the Pan-African Parliament and
the judicial organs, and a more detailed assessment is underway to develop more
detailed recommendations on how to strengthen the effectiveness of these Organs.

           Strategic Partnerships:

136. The Commission also completed an initial review of AU’s strategic partnerships.
On its part, the PRC Sub-Committee on Multilateral Cooperation began to draft an
overall Partnerships Strategy, with a view to establishing clear principles, enhance the
Union’s capacity to negotiate effective partnerships and monitor their implementation
and impact of African people.

           AU Development Agency:

137. The Assembly meeting in Nouakchott in July 2018 adopted decision
Assembly/AU/Dec.691(XXXI) on the transformation of the NEPAD Planning and
Coordinating Agency (NPCA) into the African Union Development Agency (AUDA). The
Assembly in Nouakchott also agreed on the governance structure for the new AU’s
Development Agency.

           African Peer Review Mechanism:

138. Proposals on how to strengthen the African Peer Review Mechanism (APRM)
focused on establishing the predictable financing of this institution by integrating it into
the AU budget and developing an annual State of Governance in Africa report as a tool
to track overall governance in Africa.

           Peace and Security Council:

139. The Peace and Security Council held a retreat in Cairo in October 2018 to reflect,
among others, on how to strengthen its working methods and its role in conflict
prevention and management.

140. It is against this background that at its extraordinary Summit on AU institutional
reform, which was held at AU headquarters from 17 to 18 November 2018, the
Assembly adopted its decision [Ext/Assembly/AU/Dec.1(XI) :

       a)   to reduce the size of the Commission from 10 to 8, in order to rationalise
            senior leadership portfolios and improve overall efficiency. From 2021, the
            Commission’s senior leadership will now comprise the Chairperson of the
            Commission, the Deputy Chairperson and six (6) Commissioners;

       b)   to strengthen the selection process for the senior leadership by introducing
            a new competency-based assessment that will be overseen by a Panel of
            Eminent Africans assisted by an independent African consultancy firm;
-----------------------Page 25 End-----------------------

                                                                      EX.CL/1134(XXXIV)
                                                                                Page 23

      c)    to strengthen performance management and accountability at the senior
            leadership level by introducing performance contracts that will be monitored
            on an annual basis;

      d)    to clarify termination procedures for the senior leadership of the
            Commission; and

      e)    to adopt a new and enhanced sanctions regime against Member States for
            the non-payment of their contributions in a timely manner.

D.    IMPLEMENTATION OF AGENDA 2063 FTYIP

      I.    Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Framework for Agenda 2063

141. The Commission, in collaboration with the RECs, the NEPAD Agency, UNECA,
the African Development Bank, and the African Symposium on Statistical Development,
developed the M&E Framework for Agenda 2063 First Ten Year Implementation Plan
(FTYIP) and the SDGs. The M&E Framework was adopted by the Executive Council in
January 2018 [EX.CL./998 (XXXII)].

142. The adoption of the M&E Framework has led, among other steps, to an
agreement on a unified implementation and monitoring plan, as well as a reporting
template for Agenda 2063 and 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development Goals
(SDGs). In preparation for the operationalization of the Framework, the NEPAD Agency
developed a handbook with detailed profiles of each of the core indicators, as well as a
training manual and an implementation support architecture with corresponding tools for
alignment, data collection, analysis, reporting and data visualization. In addition, the
Strategy for Harmonization of Statistics in Africa (SHaSA) was initiated to cater for both
Agenda 2063 and 2030 Agenda for SDGs.

      II.   Domestication of Agenda 2063 First Ten-Year Implementation Plan

143. Domestication of Agenda 2063’s First Ten-Year Implementation Plan into
national planning frameworks is gaining traction with forty (40) Member States that had
done so by the time of this reporting.

144. The Commission organised the second consolidation workshop on domestication
of Agenda 2063 in Nairobi in September 2018, to take stock of progress made in this
area, share experiences and lessons learnt in this process, as well as draw insights on
how the integration of Agenda 2063 and the SDGs had progressed since the last
meeting held in Maseru in December 2016.

145. The Nairobi meeting identified the kind of technical assistance and other needs
that are required of the Commission in its efforts to support Member States in the
process. The meeting also addressed the issue of progress in reporting on Agenda
2063 by Member States to AU Summits and identified ways to popularize Agenda 2063
to the African citizenry.

                                                                                Page 24

      III.   Domestic Resource Mobilization for Agenda 2063

146. Following the adoption of the Domestic Resource Mobilization strategy by the
Executive Council in January 2018, the Commission convened a preparatory meeting
with the African Development Bank in Addis Ababa in June 2018 for the
operationalization of the strategy. In this regard, it was agreed that a platform
comprising identified key stakeholder institutions – the Commission, the African
Development Bank, UNECA, and the NEPAD Agency – would be launched in February
2019, to develop a domestic resource mobilization roadmap and guidelines that will be
circulated to all Member States for domestication. Implementation of the strategy and its
roadmap is expected to commence in 2019.

      IV.    Joint AU/UN Framework on the implementation of Agenda 2063 and
             SDGs

147. Progress has been made since the adoption of the two agendas in 2015. It
includes the development of a monitoring and evaluation framework that accommodates
both Agendas and a common reporting framework that will help to produce a single
periodic performance report.

148. The Chairperson of the Commission and the Secretary-General of the United
Nations signed in Addis Ababa on 27 January 2018, the African Union-United Nations
Framework for the Implementation of Agenda 2063 and the 2030 Agenda for
Sustainable Development. The AU-UN Framework sets out the conditions for
cooperation between the African Union and the United Nations, which will include joint
activities and programs to ensure efficient implementation, monitoring, evaluation and
reporting on the two Agendas.

149. The Commission initiated contacts with the UN and its various agencies in
several African countries on how the M&E Framework for Agenda 2063 will be rolled out
and what capacity will be needed for its operationalization.

150. Meanwhile, the first annual report under the title Africa Sustainable Development
Report Tracking Progress on Agenda 2063 and the Sustainable Development Goals
was completed and disseminated in 2017. The second report for the year 2018 was
launched in Rwanda in December 2018.

      V.     Revitalization of the Ministerial Committee on Agenda 2063

151. Following the adoption by the Executive Council of the decision on the
revitalization of the Ministerial Committee on Agenda 2063 in January 2018
[EX.CL/Dec.998(XXXII), the Ambassadorial Committee on Agenda 2063 was
established and its rules of procedure drafted.

152. The Ministerial Committee met informally in the margins of the Nouakchott
Summit in July 2018. It had planned to meet in December 2018 to finalize its Progress
Report on the implementation of Agenda 2063 and on its revitalization process.
However, the meeting has been postponed for March 2019, and the report will be

                                                                        EX.CL/1134(XXXIV)
                                                                                  Page 25

submitted to the Assembly for further consideration during the July 2019 Summit.

E.    IMPLEMENTATION OF DECISIONS OF THE POLICY ORGANS

153. During the period under review, the Commission implemented fifty-five (55) of the
ninety-seven decisions (56.7%). It should be pointed out, however, that some decisions
– such as those that confirm the results of the elections or congratulate Member States
for hosting the Union's Summits – do not give rise to action. This category of decisions
reduces the rate of implementation.

154. As regards Member States, the Commission had addressed a questionnaire
seeking information about Member States’ implementation activities. Only three – Mali,
Mauritius and Morocco – responded.

155. The responsibility to implement the Union’s decisions rests primarily with
Member States with the support of various Organs and Specialized Agencies. While the
current trend appears to be positive, many constraints continue to impede this process.
They include the following:

      (i)     most decisions are adopted after the approval of the current year's budget
              and cannot therefore be implemented in the absence of a budgetary
              provision;

      (ii)    some decisions are not likely to be implemented because of the exorbitant
              financial cost they entail;

      (iii)   often some decisions face a very short implementation time due to the
              limited time interval between the sessions of the Policy Organs;

      (iv) late payment by Member States of their statutory contributions and late
           release of funds by partners also contribute to these implementation
           challenges;

      (v)     despite the reduction in the number of decisions, there are still too many to
              be implemented from each session of the Policy Organs.

156. It is also useful to reform the procedure for the submission and adoption of
decisions and preclude the adoption of decisions that will never be implemented by,
among others, (i) ensuring that the draft decisions are in coherence with the available
human and financial resources; (ii) limiting the number of draft decisions to be submitted
to the Policy Organs; and (iii) ensuring the conformity of the draft decisions with AU
legal instruments.

157. Member States are also urged to forward to the Commission their response to
the implementation questionnaire to facilitate the production of the report on the
implementation of decisions within the time-limit.

                                                                                Page 26

F.    DELIVERING ON CONTINENTAL FRAMEWORKS AND MANDATES

      I.    Economic Transformation, Inclusive Growth, Poverty Reduction

                Africa Industrialization Week

158. The Commission commemorated the Africa Industrialization Week (AIW2018) in
Addis Ababa during the period of 18 to 23 November 2018, pursuant to the resolution of
the Heads of State and Government of the OAU – AHG/Res.180 (XXV) – of July 1989,
which proclaimed 20 November as the Africa Industrialization Day, to be celebrated
annually, “for the purpose of mobilizing the commitment of African countries and the
international community towards the industrialization of Africa”.

159. The 2018 event was organized in partnership with the NEPAD Agency, UNIDO
and UNECA. It aimed to enhance consciousness and understanding of the opportunities
and challenges associated with the industrialization drive on the continent. It also
provided a platform for business to business interface, to enhance prospects for
developing business partnerships and investment promotion.

                Accelerated Industrial Development for Africa (AIDA)

160. Following the endorsement by the Assembly in 2008 – (Assembly/AU/Dec.175(X)
– of the Action Plan for the Accelerated Industrial Development for Africa (AIDA), the
Commission, through its Department of Trade and Industry, has worked closely with
Member States and the RECs to implement the pan-African industrialization blueprint.

161. Notable progress has been made in this regard as most RECs now have their
own regional industrialization strategies. However, at the continental level, the
implementation of the strategy over the last ten-year period (2008-2018) has been slow.
This is mainly due to the absence of an institutional mechanism to drive the
implementation and coordination of AIDA activities, as well as lack of financial
resources dedicated to this program.

162. In an effort to accelerate the pace of AIDA implementation, the Commission, with
the financial support of UNIDO, set up the Implementation Coordination Unit (ICU) in
May 2018, to coordinate the implementation, monitoring and evaluation of AIDA.

163. Special Economic Zones (SEZs) experienced a promising resurgence in Africa’s
industrialization agenda, thanks in particular to the cooperation with China on industrial
capacity development, as well as the inspiring achievements of some African countries
in this regard. Many Member States and RECs have included SEZs as a key element in
their industrialization policies and their strategies to foster economic growth and
competitiveness.

164. As part of initiatives in this area, the Commission participated in the launch of the
first phase of Africa’s biggest free trade zone in Djibouti in July 2018. The free trade
zone, which was built in partnership with the Chinese government, is part of the Sino-

                                                                      EX.CL/1134(XXXIV)
                                                                                Page 27

Africa initiatives. It was opened during the Africa-China Economic Forum that was
hosted by Djibouti to ensure deeper commercial collaboration between the public and
private sectors.

                Implementation of the Action Plan on Boosting Intra-African
                 Trade

165. Under the Action Plan on Boosting Intra-African Trade, within the domain of
Trade Facilitation and Customs Cooperation, the need to promote competitiveness of
African countries and goods in the international market calls for an agreed common and
shared mechanism that will assist the stakeholders to have a coherent approach. As
directed by the African Union Subcommittee of Directors General of Customs
(AUSCDGC), the Commission, through the Department of Trade and Industry,
continued to facilitate and coordinate the different programme activities with a view to
expediting the free movement of goods. In the same vein, a draft AU Trade Facilitation
Strategy was developed in line with international instruments and best practices, such
as the WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement and the World Customs Organization
Revised Kyoto Convention, and also taking into consideration existing trade facilitation
initiatives at national and regional levels. The development of the AU trade facilitation
strategy has an ultimate objective of enhancing economic growth and development in
Africa.

                AU Trade Observatory

166. The Assembly, in its decision Assembly/AU/Dec.394(XVIII) of January 2012,
endorsed the framework, roadmap and architecture for fast-tracking the establishment
of the AfCFTA and the action plan for Boosting Intra-African Trade. The AfCFTA’s
architecture includes, among others, the establishment of the African Union Trade
Observatory (ATO), to be located within the Commission’s Department of Trade and
Industry. The ATO will provide updated and reliable trade data and information to
support policies and business decisions, and facilitate the monitoring of the AfCFTA’s
implementation process.

167. The AU Trade Observatory is a collaborative project between the Commission,
the EU and ITC, with the RECs as co-partners. The African Centre for Statistics and the
UNECA are members of the Steering Committee. The project will be funded by the EU
for €4million from the €50 million envelope recently announced by the EU in support of
the AfCFTA implementation.

                Maritime Strategy (Blue Economy)

168. The Commission and the Government of the Seychelles jointly organised in April
2018 the 2018 Africa Shippers Summit for AU Ministers and stakeholders in the
maritime sector. Participants underscored the need for the AU to appoint a Blue
Economy Champion for Africa. Subsequently, President Danny Faure of Seychelles
was appointed the Blue Economy Champion at the Assembly’s extraordinary session
held in Addis Ababa in November 2018.
-----------------------Page 30 End-----------------------

                                                                     EX.CL/1134(XXXIV)
                                                                               Page 28

169. Pursuant to decision EX.CL/Dec.822 (XXV) of June 2014, the Commission
activated an interdepartmental team under the coordination of the Office of the Legal
Counsel to ensure more integrated action with regard to maritime matters. In this
direction, the organization of an AU-ECA side event during the Blue economy
Conference in Nairobi in November 2018 constituted a significant step.

170. At the Nairobi Conference, the Commission, working with UNECA, organized a
side event that achieved the following results:

      (i)     establish a better understanding of the challenges and opportunities for
              African coastal, maritime and inland water governance as well as stimulate
              concrete proposals that will contribute to the 2019 African Union Blue
              Economy Strategy, with clear prioritization of women and youth
              participation;

      (ii)    promote notable key sectors that require improved private sector
              involvement, with a focus on women participation. They include fisheries,
              tourism, transport, renewable energy, aquaculture, seabed extractive
              activities, and biotechnology and bio prospecting;

      (iii)   launch the establishment of a platform to coordinate and facilitate the
              synchronization between existing sectors, institutions and industries
              relevant to the Blue Economy by highlighting best practices and awarding
              recognition to Champions at the presidential level, industry and
              collaborating partners with a special focus of women in the Blue Economy
              regime. Four heads of state – Guinea, Mauritius, Seychelles and Togo – as
              well as the Women in Maritime Africa (WIMA) organization and an
              outstanding woman Blue Economy practitioner – Ms Nancy Kariginthi from
              Kenya – received awards tied to the Blue Economy from the Chairperson of
              the Commission;

      (iv) also launch of one of the mechanisms provided under the 2050 Africa
           Integrated Maritime (AIM) Strategy during the award ceremony, namely the
           High College of Champions. Naming the champions and giving them
           acknowledgement prizes from heads of states, governments and civil
           society was a direct implementation of the said AIM strategy. The Champion
           – President Faure of Mauritius – is a member of the High College but his
           specific mandate is more continental and aligned to the development
           aspects of the Blue Economy.

171. The Commission commenced work on the development of a Blue Economy
Strategy to ensure that Africa benefits from its maritime resource endowments. The
Strategy is expected to be finalized in March 2019.

                  Pharmaceutical manufacturing plan for Africa

172. Implementation of the Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Plan for Africa resulted in
the launch of the African Medicines Regulatory Harmonization initiative led by the
NEPAD Agency, and the establishment of the African Medicines Agency (AMA).
-----------------------Page 31 End-----------------------

                                                                      EX.CL/1134(XXXIV)
                                                                                Page 29


173. Development of the pharmaceutical manufacturing sector has been hampered by
lack of access to financing and responsiveness to the needs of the sector. It was in view
of these challenges that the Specialized Technical Committee (STC) on Health,
Population and Drug Control recommended, in March 2017, the establishment of the
Fund for African Pharmaceutical Development to accelerate the realization of the
Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Plan for Africa.

                Africa Mining Vision

174. The Statute establishing the African Minerals Development Centre (AMDC) as an
AU Specialised Agency responsible for coordinating the implementation of the Africa
Mining Vision was adopted by the Assembly at the January 2016 Summit
[Assembly/AU/Dec.589(XXVI)]. Subsequently, the Assembly, in its decision
Assembly/AUDec.697(XXXI) of July 2018, decided that the AMDC will be hosted by the
Republic of Guinea. The Assembly also directed that the AMDC Interim Secretariat be
hosted by the Commission to facilitate the finalisation of the Host Agreement and
putting in place the Governance Structure as well as expedite the ratification of the
AMDC Statute. The AMDC Interim Secretariat has already moved to the Commission,
funds for recruitment of interim staff have been acquired and the recruitment of the new
AMDC Staff is ongoing. The transition process has commenced and will be concluded
as soon as possible and, in any event, by the end of 2019.

175. Since the adoption of the Africa Mining Vision by the Heads of State and
Government in 2009, Member States have either domesticated it in its totality – Lesotho
– or have used it to review their mining laws – Ghana, Kenya and Namibia, among
others. Apart from Member States, a number of institutions have also been
strengthened, including the Organisation of Africa Geological Surveys (OAGS), which is
now partnering with EuroGeo Surveys to implement a €10 million Geoscience capacity
building programme called PanAfGeo that will train over 1200 young geoscientist in
various areas within the next three (3) years 2018-2012.

176. In terms of strengthening and consolidating the private sector in the mineral
resources sector, an Association of Chamber of Mines and other Mining Associations in
Africa and the African Women in Mining Association (AWIMA) have been established;
they have already endorsed the AMV Private Sector Compact. A Mining Model law is
also being developed to assist in the harmonization of African mining codes. An
artisanal and small-scale mining strategy is also under development to ensure that the
artisanal and small-scale mining sector contributes optimally to the social and economic
development agenda of the continent.

                Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises (SMEs)

177. Recognizing the importance of private sector-led growth in contributing to Africa’s
economic development, the AU Conference of African Ministers of Industry (CAMI 20),
which was held in Nairobi in June 2013, identified industrialization as the basis for
development, with the private sector playing a critical role in supporting sustainable
-----------------------Page 32 End-----------------------

                                                                      EX.CL/1134(XXXIV)
                                                                                Page 30

industrialization. CAMI also directed Member States to create an enabling environment
for the creation and operation of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and small
and medium-sized industries (SMIs);

178. As a follow-up, the Commission drafted an SME Strategy and Master Plan for
Africa (2019-2023), The Commission planned to submit the SME Strategy for the
consideration of the STC on Trade, Industry and Minerals in January 2019, for its final
adoption by the Policy Organs at the February 2019 Summit.

                Enterprise Africa Network

179. During the year under review, the Commission worked closely with private sector
organizations and Afreximbank on the revival of the Pan-African Private Sector Trade
and Investment Committee (PAFTRAC), which was created in 2011 to serve as an
advocacy platform to enhance African private sector participation in the formulation of
trade and investment policy – including the negotiations and implementation of trade
agreements – and to channel private sector expectations to policy makers. Following a
working group meeting that took place in Nairobi in February 2018, the Commission
convened the PAFTRAC inaugural meeting in Addis Ababa in October 2018, which
resulted in the setting up of a steering committee for the project.

180. During the period under review, the Commission sought ways to address
problems faced by small and medium enterprises in their quest to sustain themselves.
This effort was in addition to the SME Strategy that was developed in 2017 and will be
submitted for the consideration of the Policy Organs at the February 2019 Summit. The
Commission initiated a feasibility study on “Enterprise Africa Network’’ (EAN) in the
framework of the EU-funded Joint Africa-EU Strategy (JAES) Support Mechanism II.

181. With regards to the development of Regional Value Chains, the Commission
began the development of a viable cassava value chain in Africa. Africa is the largest
cassava producer in the world, producing about 55% of the global market. Four of the
world’s top ten cassava producers are in Africa, namely, Nigeria, Democratic Republic
of Congo (DRC), Ghana and Angola. The Commission’s Department of Trade and
Industry continued to support the capacity of small-holder cassava producers to link with
the market, whilst at the same time implementing programs to anchor transformation of
the sector towards a higher value chain production system to enhance farm gate and
upstream incomes.

182. Africa’s private sector has the potential to be part of global value chains and
benefit from the technology needed through joint ventures and other forms of
partnerships with private sector actors from other parts of the world. In light of the
above, the Commission drafted the African Union Private Sector Development Strategy
2016-2020 in November 2015 as a concrete step towards enhancing private sector
capacity to be part of the global value chains. Through the Department of Economic
Affairs, the Commission was actively involved in initiatives to promote public-private
cooperation and capacity building for African young and women entrepreneurs to equip
them with innovative ideas and entrepreneurial skills. The Commission also assisted
Member States in developing policies that are conducive to the development of the

                                                                    EX.CL/1134(XXXIV)
                                                                              Page 31

private sector, with a particular emphasis on strengthening local micro, small and
medium-size enterprises.

183. On its part, the NEPAD Agency set up a Country Agribusiness Partnerships
Framework and a multi-stakeholder platform to untap private sector resources, enable
connection of key players in the agriculture value chains, and match investors to
business opportunities that are framed in national development plans. The following
Member States took part in phase 1 of these multi-stakeholder platforms for the
following products: Benin (pineapple), Côte d’Ivoire (rice), Burkina Faso (mango), and
Kenya (potato).

184. Grow Africa is an integral part of the CAADP implementation process,
championing private sector engagement in support of National Agriculture Investment
Plans. The project delivered on four key result areas, namely (i) mobilization of high
level (political) commitment; (ii) mainstreaming of the private sector into National
Agricultural Investment Plans; (iii) connection of value chain partners; and (iv)
knowledge sharing for innovation.

                Pan African Investment Code

185. During the Third Conference of African Ministers in Charge of Integration
(COMAI III) held in Abidjan in May 2008, the Ministers requested the Commission to
create a conducive environment to attract greater flows of investments into Africa and
facilitate intra-African cross-border investments. The Ministers mandated the
Commission “to develop a comprehensive Investment Code for Africa with a view to
promoting private sector participation”.

186. The draft code was submitted to the STC on Finance, Monetary Affairs,
Economic Planning and Integration held at the AU headquarters in Addis Ababa in
October 2017. The Ministers considered the revised Pan African Investment Code and
requested the Commission to submit it to the STC on Trade, Industry and Minerals. The
Commission presented the draft to the Consultative Meeting of this STC at the level of
senior officials, held in Addis Ababa in October 2018. The Consultative Meeting
recommended that the Pan African Investment Code should be used as a reference
framework document in the negotiations of the AfCFTA investment chapter.

                Establishment of the African Inclusive Market Excellence Centre

187. By its decision EX.CL./Dec.987(XXXII) of January 2018, the Executive Council
approved the establishment of the African Inclusive Market Excellence Centre (AIMEC)
and requested the Commission, among others, to look at the practical modalities of
operationalizing the Centre, in line with the AU rules and procedures, by ensuring that
the selection of the Member State to host the Centre be carried out in conformity with
the relevant criteria. So far, three Member States, namely Benin, Senegal and Tunisia,
have offered to host the AIMEC. The Commission will conclude the selection of the host
country in early 2019.

      II.   Agricultural Productivity and Production: Implementation of CAADP

                Supporting Countries and Regional systems

188. Since the adoption by the Assembly in June 2014 – Assembly/AU/Decl.1(XXIII) –
of the Malabo Declaration on Accelerated Agricultural Growth and Transformation for
Shared Prosperity and Improved Livelihoods [Doc.Assembly/AU/2(XXIII)] and the
development of the CAADP implementation guidelines, the Commission, working with
the RECs and NEPAD Agency, provided support to twenty-seven (27) Member States
in the domestication of the Malabo Declaration in the National Agriculture Investment
Plans (NAIPs), with the objective to reach twenty (20) more in 2019. The support
focused on the alignment of the revised or updated NAIPs to the countries’ planning
cycles and budget processes.

189. The Commission also launched two key continental frameworks to help Member
States implement their National Agriculture Investment Plans, one on agricultural
mechanization and the other on postharvest loss management. The Commission also
developed the Country Agribusiness Partnership Framework (CAP-F) as a tool to
mobilize private investments in the agriculture sector. The CAP-F was rolled out in five
(5) AU Member States (Ghana, Malawi, Senegal, Tanzania and Uganda) with a target
to reach fifteen (15) in 2019.

                Enhancing food security and nutrition - Declaration on Hunger
                 Free Africa by 2025

190. In the Malabo Declaration, Member States made a commitment to end hunger in
Africa by 2025 and resolved to accelerate agricultural growth by at least doubling
current agricultural productivity levels. Member States also committed to create and
enhance the necessary appropriate policy and institutional conditions and support
systems for crops, livestock, fisheries, amongst others, and the promotion and
protection of smallholder agriculture.

191. During the year under review, the Commission initiated various interventions to
assist Member States in achieving the goal of ending hunger in Africa by 2025. The
Commission also commemorated the annual African Day for Food and Nutritional
Security to create the needed awareness for attaining a hunger-free Africa by 2025. The
2017 Africa Day for Food and Nutrition Security took place in Côte d’Ivoire, while this
year’s commemoration will be held in Dar es Salaam on 5 December 2018.

192. The NEPAD Agency contributed to a preparatory survey in ten (10) Member
States – Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Madagascar, Malawi, Mozambique,
Nigeria, Senegal and Sudan – that were implementing the Initiative on Food and
Nutrition in Africa (IFNA). The survey findings will inform the development of the IFNA
Country Strategy for Action (ICSA), which will prioritise intervention action on food and
nutritional security and provide guidelines for its implementation. An ICSA Consultative
workshop comprising the ten countries was convened in Dakar in April 2018 to share
the lessons and good practices. A consultative technical mission was deployed to two

additional IFNA countries – Chad and Mauritania – in August and September 2018,
respectively.

193. In March 2018, the NEPAD Agency partnered with the Pan African Parliament
(PAP) in the organization of a high-level advocacy event on nutrition and food systems
for nutrition investments at the community level. A resolution on nutrition and food
systems was adopted in May 2018, during the 6 th ordinary session for the Pan African
Parliament. The NEPAD Agency also held in Johannesburg in August 2018, a capacity
building workshop for SADC Member States to advance the nutrition agenda in the
region. During its October 2018 session, the Pan-African Parliament adopted a
resolution on the development of a Model Law on Food Security and Nutrition in Africa.

194. FAO and the NEPAD Agency developed a Technical Cooperation Project (TCP)
to incorporate indigenous crops into the African Nutritious Food Basket for improved
food security and nutrition. The cost of the project for East and Southern Africa is
estimated at US$500,000. By the time of this reporting, the parties had not yet signed
the TCP.

                Strengthening mutual accountability and biennial review process

195. Pursuant to the Malabo Declaration, the Commission submitted the first CAADP
biennial review report to the Assembly at its January 2018 Summit. The report aims to
track progress in the implementation of the Union’s agricultural transformation agenda
and serve as a mutual accountability tool for Member States in this collective
endeavour. Forty-seven (47) Member States submitted their country reports that the
Commission used to compile the biennial review report. Twenty (20) among the forty-
seven countries were on track towards achieving the Malabo goals and targets by 2025.

196. The Commission, RECs and NEPAD Agency, working with partners, assisted
Member State on how to efficiently use the outcomes of the biennial review and institute
accountability mechanism for Malabo implementation at country level for more results
and greater impact on people’s livelihoods.

197. The Commission has put in place a dedicated mechanism and developed a
roadmap to support Member States in the drafting and submission of their next
contributions by June 2019. The second CAADP review report will be presented to the
Policy Organs at the January 2020 Summit.

                Livestock development strategy in Africa (LiDeSA) and policy
                 framework

198. The Livestock Development Strategy for Africa (LiDeSA) is the blueprint for
livestock development in Africa. Its objective is to transform the livestock sector for
enhanced contribution to Africa’s socio-economic development and inclusive growth.
This is being achieved through the promotion of priority livestock value chains with
comparative advantage at the national and regional levels. The Commission is currently
implementing LiDeSA through the Sustainable Development of Livestock for Livelihoods

                                                                           EX.CL/1134(XXXIV)
                                                                                     Page 34

(Live2Africa) project that seeks to address livestock issues on the continent through a
value chain approach.

199. Live2Africa’s implementation was delayed in the first half of 2018 due to slow
staff recruitment, deployment processes and delayed release of partner funding.
Nevertheless, implementation of activities picked up in the second half of 2018, with
several activities, including support to Member States and the RECs to develop
strategies to manage a disease of small ruminants called the Peste des Petits
ruminants (PPR) and the creation of continental platforms and associations of key
stakeholders in livestock development.

200. Additionally, the Commission established the African Association of Veterinary
Education Establishments (2A2E-V) in July 2018, with the secretariat at AU-IBAR, to
enhance the quality of veterinary education, training and research in Africa. The
Association will also enhance collaboration among African academic and research
institutions involved in veterinary education and spearhead innovation and curricular
harmonization.

201. Similarly, the African Association of Veterinary Statutory Bodies (2AVSB), the
Veterinary Education Establishments (VEEs), Veterinary Statutory Bodies (VSBs), the
African Women in Animal Resources Farming and Agribusiness (AWARFA-N), the
Africa Youth in Livestock (AY-L), and the Fisheries and Aquaculture Incubators Network
were established in July 2018. These associations and networks are expected to
address the challenge of the lack of veterinary regulations; enhance veterinary training;
promote greater investment in women-led animal resources farming and agribusiness;
and boost job creation for the youth in the animal resources sector. Activities of these
associations/networks will be rolled out in 2019.

202. Through Live2Africa, the Animal Resources Information System (ARIS) was also
sustained. Further, the identification and mapping of priority livestock value chains is
underway and expected to be realized in the first quarter of 2019.

                 Policy framework and            reform     strategy    for   fisheries   and
                  aquaculture in Africa

203. During the period under review, the Commission’s Department of Rural Economy
and Agriculture developed the following policy frameworks to advance the conservation
and sustainable use of fisheries and aquaculture resources in the Blue Economy: (i)
framework for the formulation of minimum terms and conditions for access to marine
fisheries; (ii) regional plan of action for combating Illegal fishing for the regional fisheries
bodies in West Africa; and (iii) framework for establishing regional coordinating centre
for Monitoring, Control and Surveillance (MCS) for Central Africa in the premises of the
Regional Fisheries Body (Regional Commission for Gulf of Guinea) in Libreville.

204. The Commission plans to operationalize the Policy Framework and Reform
Strategy for Fisheries and Aquaculture (PFRS) in the various regions of the African
Continent by supporting the establishment of MCS centres to continuously measure,
regulate and follow up on maintenance of compliance issues with the regulatory controls
imposed on fishing activities.

                                                                               Page 35


205. Besides, the Commission supported Member States and the RECs in
implementing international guidelines for securing sustainable small-scale fisheries. It
also provided assistance to thirty (30) Member States to align their national fisheries
and aquaculture policies with the PFRS. In addition, a continental strategy for rational
management of inland fisheries was developed.

206. In 2019, the Commission plans to assist Member States in domesticating these
frameworks and strategies into their national policies and regulations for coherent
management of shared resources.

207. The continental aquaculture network - the Intergovernmental Aquaculture
Network for Africa (ANAF) – was transferred from FAO to AU-IBAR in July 2018. The
NEPAD Agency assisted in the transfer and in strengthening the linkages between the
RECs and regional fisheries bodies to enhance accountability in fisheries management
and aquaculture development. Through a pilot project of the Eco Mark Africa, the
NEPAD Agency provided support to four (4) Member States – Cameroon, Gabon,
Guinea and Nigeria – in their efforts to improve fisheries in accordance with regional
and international regulations and increase their access to global fish markets. Notable
success has been recorded with regard to improved governance of ornamental fisheries
and trade in Guinea.

208. In Côte d’Ivoire and Senegal, the NEPAD Agency’s assistance helped to
increase trade amongst private sector associations. Dedicated support was provided to
women fish processors and traders, as well as aquaculture producers to help them
make better use of the growing trade opportunities through competitive small and
medium scale enterprises. The support provided also included capacity development
and operationalisation of the African network of women fish processors and traders
(AWFishNet).

                Sustainable utilization, management and conservation of animal
                 resources and their ecosystems

209. During the year 2018, the Commission assisted twenty-five (25) Member States
in the formulation of appropriate policies and regulatory frameworks for animal
resources. The Commission also developed five regional guidelines for the formulation,
harmonization of policies on animal crossbreeding.

210. Legislations and policies for the management of animal genetic resources
(AnGR) were developed and validated by Member States, National Coordinators for
AnGR, RECs, farmers associations, NGOs, tertiary institutions, and the private sector in
all the five AU regions. As of this reporting, eighteen (18) policy notes on various
aspects of the management and development of AnGR were available for Member
States’ use. Meanwhile, an African Animal Genetic Resources Information System
(AAGRIS) is expected to be launched in the first quarter of 2019. It will serve as the
continental platform for sharing information on AnGR.

                                                                                    Page 36

                 Veterinary governance and animal health systems

211. The Commission finalized the development of the Animal Health Strategy for
Africa (AHSA) in December 2018. This Strategy seeks to enhance the contribution of
the animal resources sector to livelihoods and improvement of public health through
enhanced veterinary service delivery; strengthened harmonization and coordination of
programmes and initiatives; and enhanced         partnerships among other livestock
stakeholders. Through the Department of Rural Economy and Agriculture, the
Commission will initiate and complete the process for endorsement of the AHSA by the
Executive Council and the Summit in June-July 2019 Summit.

212. During the year under review, the Commission also set up the Continental
Animal Health Platform (CAHP-Africa). This continent-wide network of public and
private actors involved in animal health seeks to strengthen the implementation of the
Animal Health Strategy for Africa.

                 Pan African Vaccine Centre

213. In 2018, the Pan African Vaccine Centre (PANVAC) received a total of 330
batches of vaccine samples for quality control test. In total, thirty-six (36) different types
of vaccines were received from the laboratories of thirty-two (32) Member States. The
pass rate for quality control was over 85%, which shows an increase in the number of
batches of vaccines tested per year and the AU-PANVAC’s visibility. The total number
of batches tested represents a total of 912,187,289 doses of animal vaccines tested.

214. Diagnostic kits and reagents produced at PANVAC were supplied to the following
Member States: Botswana, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Congo
Republic, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Djibouti, Equatorial-Guinea, Gabon,
Morocco, Sao-Tome & Principe and Zambia.

215. As part of the AU’s commitment to eradicate all Rinderpest virus strains, the
PANVAC implemented the resolutions of the 8th Conference of Ministers responsible
for Animal Health in Africa held in Entebbe in May, 2010, as subsequently endorsed by
the Executive Council [EX.CL/Dec. 610 (XVIII)] in January 2011. Presently, twelve
among the thirteen countries have transferred their wild virus and vaccine seed strains
to AU-PANVAC’s safe custody. All unnecessary materials – tissue samples and other
unpurified material that contain the wild virus – have been destroyed by the countries
that held them, the last being Nigeria in Vom on 27 September 2018. The destruction in
Nigeria marked the conclusion of a process that began with the discovery of the
materials in a university in Northern Nigeria in November 2017.

216. The Chairperson of the Commission inaugurated the Continental Rinderpest
Vaccine Bank at PANVAC in January 2018. Efforts are underway to support the
establishment of a modern laboratory for AU-PANVAC and stock the Bank with 10
million doses of emergency preparedness vaccines in accordance with the resolution of
the Rinderpest Sequestration meeting that took place in Sharm el Sheik in 2015. The
Continental Rinderpest Vaccine Bank presently holds vaccine seed stocks and 1.5
million doses of vaccines to be used in any rinderpest outbreak globally.

                                                                      EX.CL/1134(XXXIV)
                                                                                Page 37


217. The PANVAC also finalized the process for the procurement of 250,000 doses of
Rinderpest emergency vaccines for storage at the Bank, as well as a walk-in cold room
which will be used for the storage of the vaccines.

218. The PANVAC held several training sessions for Member States on vaccine
production and animal disease control. They included an emergency preparedness
session for Rinderpest outbreak for Member States’ diagnostics and vaccine
laboratories that took place in Debre-Zeit, Ethiopia, in January-February 2018. In
addition, a Workshop on production and quality control of the dreaded disease of village
chickens called the “Newcastle disease” was conducted for ten (10) Member States at
Debre-Zeit in November 2018. Four (4) other laboratory staff were trained in vaccine
quality control techniques. Technical support for the control of the disease of sheep and
goats, also known as “Peste des Petits Ruminants”, was provided to Botswana in
January 2018, Burundi in January to February 2018, and Djibouti in April to May 2015,
while 17 laboratory technicians were trained on the diagnosis of animal diseases in
general.

219. In accordance with international standards and in recognition of its capacity and
expertise in vaccine quality testing, the PANVAC was conferred with the International
Standard Organization (ISO) 17025 Certification by the Ethiopian National Accreditation
Organization (ENAO) on 22 November 2018. This is the highest recognition any testing
laboratory can receive globally. It places PANVAC in the category of world-class
recognized laboratories.

                Pan African Tsetse and Trypanosomiasis Eradication Campaign

220. The African Union Pan African Tsetse and Trypanosomiasis Eradication
Campaign (AU-PATTEC) continued to coordinate the Union’s efforts for the creation of
tsetse and trypanosomiasis (T&T) free areas. During the period under review, thirty-five
participants from twenty-eight affected countries received training on planning and
managing large scale programmes to reduce the disease burden. Ethiopia, Mali,
Burkina Faso, Kenya, Uganda Ghana, Zimbabwe, Nigeria, Senegal, Zambia have
sustained the gains registered in the areas where tsetse and trypanosomiasis burden
has been reduced.

221. Capacity building training sessions were also held for Tanzania (March 2018)
and Mozambique (April 2018), as well as ECOWAS (May 2018) and the East Africa
region (August 2018) on the application of open source geographical information
system technology in tsetse and trypanosomiasis eradication projects. In addition,
PATTEC carried out monitoring and evaluation missions to Rwanda (March 2018), and
Côte d’Ivoire (October 2018) on the status of implementation of AU-PATTEC’s
initiatives.

222. Recognizing the importance of the RECs in accelerating regional integration of
the management of tsetse trypanosomiasis (T&T) interventions, the AU-PATTEC held
consultations with all T&T affected RECs (SADC, COMESA, EAC, IGAD, ECOWAS and
ECCAS), as well as two bilateral meetings with ECOWAS and ECCAS. In the future, the

                                                                    EX.CL/1134(XXXIV)
                                                                              Page 38

RECs will assume a greater role in mobilizing resources for their T&T eradication
programmes.

223. AU-PATTEC also carried out eight joint activities regarding T&T control, notably
with FAO, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the World Organization
for Animal Health (OIE). PATTEC has also worked very closely with AU-IBAR by
participating in the guiding group meetings in the process of developing an animal
health strategy for Africa (AHSA).

                Enhanced resilience of production systems to climate change
                 and improved agricultural risk management

224. Smallholder women farmers comprise nearly half of the labor force in Africa’s
agriculture sector. In Cameroon, women represent 52% of the population, contribute
75% of agricultural work and produce 80% of food. In Ethiopia, women account for
about 48% of the agricultural labor force and 70% of household food production.
Malawian women contribute 70% of the country’s agricultural labor force and produce
70% of household food. Women in Niger represent 49.5% of the national agricultural
population and reportedly spend at least five hours per day in agricultural field work.
Women in Rwanda contribute immensely to the agriculture value chain by providing
labor for planting, weeding, harvesting and processing in addition to reproductive
activities and community work.

225. Projects on the climate-agriculture-gender nexus were under implementation in
five countries, namely Cameroon, Ethiopia, Malawi, Niger and Rwanda. The objective
was to augment deployment of climate smart technologies among women and youth
small holder framers and enhance their adaptive capacity and coping mechanism of
climate externalities. The NEPAD Agency contributed USD 700,000 and technical
advice to these countries during the year 2018.

                Partnership for Aflatoxin Control in Africa and Food Safety

226. The Commission, through the Partnership for Aflatoxin Control in Africa (PACA),
continued its support to Member States and the RECs in effective and sustainable
aflatoxin management to enhance food safety, food security and nutrition as well as
improve trade and competitiveness of African foodstuffs globally.

227. The Commission organized the 3rd PACA Partnership Platform Meeting (PPM) in
Dakar in October. The meeting charted the roadmap for scaling up to all Member States
and the RECs the country-led model for aflatoxin control piloted by PACA since
2015/2015 in six Member States, namely The Gambia, Malawi, Nigeria, Senegal,
Tanzania and Uganda. PACA also participated in continental and global events to
showcase the Union’s concern for food safety and its current efforts. They included two
side events at the 14th CAADP Partnership Platform meeting in Libreville (April 2018),
the Africa Green Revolution Forum (September 2018), the Africa Food Safety
Workshop in Pretoria (June 2018), the 2nd Africa Symposium on Mycotoxicology in
Mombassa (June 2018), and the Food Safety and Healthy Diets Workshop held at the
Vatican (September 2018).

                                                                      EX.CL/1134(XXXIV)
                                                                                Page 39


228. The Commission, through PACA, advocated the mainstreaming of food safety
and aflatoxin control in continental frameworks. As a result, food safety was included in
the Malabo Declaration Biennial Review report with the development of the Africa Food
Safety Index. Through PACA, the Commission also secured €800,000 funding from the
Technical Centre for Agricultural and Rural Cooperation ACP-EU (CTA) to support food
safety tracking and prioritization in Member States.

229. High quality publications on aflatoxin control in six (6) Member States – the
Gambia, Malawi, Nigeria, Senegal, Tanzania and Uganda – are available as part of
PACA’s country situational analyses and action planning (C-SAAP). In addition, PACA,
in collaboration with the German GIZ agency, published a book on “Mycotoxin Analysis:
Focus on Rapid Methods” that provides rapid and low cost analysis of aflatoxins and
other mycotoxins. PACA also produced infographics on the ten most commonly asked
questions about aflatoxins, providing simplified visual presentation of the complex
subject. PACA published the Status of Aflatoxin Situation in Africa using data from
agriculture, trade and health sectors working with the six afore-mentioned Member
States that received support from the Commission in building aflatoxin testing and
monitoring capacity.

230. The Commission through PACA worked with the six afore-mentioned Member
States and the ECOWAS Commission and COMESA Secretariat in developing aflatoxin
control plans, mainstreaming them in national or regional strategies, and supporting
their implementation. With the Commission’s technical support, the financing of the
national aflatoxin control action plans (NACAPs) from national and partner funds
reached 4.6% of the NACAP budget in Malawi, 42% in Senegal, and 93% of the
NACAP budget in Tanzania.

231. The Commission through PACA completed a €1million grant agreement with
GIZ, of which €233,731 was disbursed in 2018 to support integrated aflatoxin control in
groundnut value chains in Malawi. With PACA’s initiative and support, the Commission
helped Tanzania to launch a USD 20 million grant project that was funded by Global
Agriculture and Food Security Program (GAFSP). The Commission also deployed full
time experts to coordinate national implementation pans in the the six (6) afore-
mentioned Member States.

232. It is in this context that the Commission, jointly with FAO and WHO, will organize
the First International Food Safety Conference in Addis Ababa from 12 to 13 February
2019. The Conference’s objectives are twofold: (i) to identify key strategies and actions
to address current and future challenges to food safety globally, and (ii) to strengthen
commitment at the highest level to scale up food safety in all continental commitments
and the Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development Goals. More than 600 delegates are
expected to take part in this event.

                AU-SAFGRAD

233. In the year 2018, AU Specialized Technical Office of Semi-Arid Food Grade
Research and Development (AU-SAFGRAD) continued to promote the development of
-----------------------Page 42 End-----------------------

                                                                        EX.CL/1134(XXXIV)
                                                                                  Page 40

agricultural strategic commodity value chains in terms of its competitiveness, efficiency
and reliability.

234. AU-SAFGRAD trained young researchers and scientists from the following
twenty-five (25) Member States on ways to improve agricultural development, in
particular small irrigation development schemes: Algeria, Botswana, Burkina Faso,
Chad, Gabon, Ghana, Kenya, Madagascar, Mali, Mauritania, Namibia, Niger, Nigeria,
Rwanda, Sao Tome & Principe, Senegal, Seychelles, Sierra Leone, South Africa,
Sudan, Tanzania, The Gambia, Togo, Tunisia and Uganda.

235. AU-SAFGRAD hosted a policy dialogue to strengthen the role of communication
and media on adaptation and mitigation of climate change and combating desertification
issues that affect resilience of rural livelihoods in dry lands of Africa. Participants from
Benin, Burkina Faso, Djibouti, Cameroon, Côte d’Ivoire, Gabon, the Gambia, Guinea,
Mauritania, Senegal, Togo, Rwanda and Uganda, as well as the NEPAD Agency
discussed the afore-mentioned topic, identified the main challenges and came out with
recommendations that will be submitted to the Conference of the Specialized Technical
Committee (STC) on Agriculture, Rural Development, Water and Environment and will
be followed up with RECs and Youth associations in Africa.

236. AU-SAFGRAD initiated a special training programme in Ouagadougou in May
2018 on land degradation neutrality for the science and technical correspondents of
UNCCD and the Great Green Wall focal points in Africa from the following twenty-nine
(29) Member States – Benin, Botswana, Burkina Faso, Cape Verde, Chad, Cote
d’Ivoire, Djibouti, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Equatorial Guinea,
Eritrea, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea Bissau, Kenya, Liberia, Mali, Mauritania,
Namibia, Niger, Nigeria, Sao Tome and Principe, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Sudan,
Eswatini, and Uganda. The objective was to create an effective platform to strengthen
and coordinate the African Group of National Science and Technical Correspondents of
UNCCD. In July-August 2018, AU-SAFGRAD also assisted ECCAS in prioritizing its
regional agricultural strategic commodities.

237. AU-SAFGRAD finalized its strategic plan for the period 2019-2023, which aims to
contribute to sustainable food security and improved rural livelihoods in semi-arid zones
of Africa. For its realization, the plan relies on the need to strengthen the policy and
institutional environment for enhancing the resilience of rural livelihoods in semi-arid
zones of Africa, and the research-related capacity for agricultural productivity and
climate change adaptation for enhanced resilience of rural livelihoods in semi-arid
zones of Africa.

                 Pastoralism

238. The Commission’s Inter-Departmental Task Force on Conflict Prevention
organized a two-day workshop at AU headquarters in September 2018 on
transhumance conflicts in Africa, to reflect on the drivers of violent conflicts between
farmers and herders and develop a continental policy on how to address such conflicts.
Participants included representatives from the five regional Farmers Association and
Pastoral Networks. A follow up meeting took place in Ouagadougou in November 2018
-----------------------Page 43 End-----------------------

                                                                      EX.CL/1134(XXXIV)
                                                                                Page 41

to draw up an implementation plan. A roadmap for the implementation of the action plan
will be finalized in March 2019.

                Rural infrastructure policy framework

239. The Commission’s Department of Rural Economy and Agriculture developed a
draft Policy Framework on Rural Infrastructure and Access to Markets. An experts
meeting was held in 2015 in Nairobi during which this policy document was critically
reviewed and refined. Follow up consultations with the Regional Economic Communities
and other key stakeholders are planned for the second quarter of 2019.

                Inter-African Phytosanitary Council (IAPSC)

240. Based on the recommendations of the last IAPSC’s General Assembly and
Steering Committee meetings held in Cairo in April 2017, the focus of the activities of
Inter-African Phytosanitary Council (IAPSC) for 2018 was on strengthening the
phytosanitary capacities of Member States and assisting them to prevent the
introduction and spread of pests.

241. During the year 2018, IAPSC worked assiduously to harmonize Africa’s position
on International Phytosanitary Standards. In March 2018, IAPSC held a workshop for
preparing the African contracting parties to the International Phytosanitary Standards
and participated in a session of the Commission of Phytosanitary Measures (Pre-CPM).
Twelve (12) Member States from the AU five regions met in Addis Ababa to discuss
international phytosanitary standards and forge a common African vision and position.
The report of this meeting was later shared with all Member States.

242. In April 2018, IAPSC participated in the CPM13 discussions in Rome on
international standards on fruit flies, Xylella fastidiosa diseases and sea containers. In
June and November 2018, IAPSC participated in meetings of the Standard Committee
of the International Plant Protection Convention (IPPC) to sensitize the participants
about the needs of African countries in phytosanitary standards for re-dress. So far, the
International Plant Protection Convention has adopted 142 standards on various
phytosanitary issues.

243. IAPSC, in collaboration with FAO, also held in Madagascar in September 2018 a
regional workshop for Africa within the ambit of the International Plant Protection
Convention (IPPC) in Madagascar in September 2018. Participants reviewed the draft
phytosanitary standards for Africa and recommended the training of African countries on
their use. IAPSC also organized two workshops on the Fall Armyworm in March and
September 2018 to sensitize Member States on how to control this pest. IAPSC and
FAO are planning another training programme on the control of the Fall Army Worm for
all Member States in January 2019.

(CAHOSCC) met in the margins of the January 2018 Summit in Addis Ababa and
adopted the Decision on Outcomes of Conference of the Parties COP23/CMP13
(Assembly/AU/9(XXX) and Africa’s Engagements at the Global Climate Change
Conference at COP24/CMP14.

245. The 48th Session of the UNFCCC Subsidiary Bodies on Implementation (SBI 48)
and Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA 48) as well as the Fifth part of the
Meeting of the Ad-hoc Working Group on Paris Agreement (APA 1.5) was held in Bonn,
Germany, from 30 April to 10 May 2018. The outcomes of these meetings contributed to
the climate negotiations at UNFCCC COP 24 in December 2018.

246. The Commission also participated in the 48th Session of the Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) held in October 2018 in Songdo, Korea. The IPCC
meeting adopted the Summary for Policy Makers on the Special Report on Global
Warming of 1.5ºC (SR1.5). The session was important for the staff of the Commission to
be updated on the scientific findings on climate change. Key recommendation made by
the Commission was that support is needed for African Scientists to participate in the
preparation of the IPCC reports.

247. The Lead Coordinators of the African Group of Negotiators on Climate Change
(AGN) with the support of the Commission convened a Strategy meeting in Cairo in
November 2018, which harmonized the African positions on emerging issues in
preparation for the 24th Conference of the Parties (COP24) of the UNFCCC that took
place in Katowice, Poland, in December 2018. The Lead Coordinators exchanged views
with the Commission on the challenges facing Member States in reporting on Nationally
Determined Contributions (NDCs). This information will help the Commission better
assist Member States on the implementation of the Paris Agreement.

248. The NEPAD Agency supported the implementation of the provisions of the Paris
Declaration by providing training and capacity building support to Member States on
implementation of Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) within the agriculture
sector. The first training session drew participants from Ghana, Kenya, Rwanda,
Tanzania, South Africa and Uganda.

249. The NEPAD Agency also supported national governments to mobilize climate
finance for investments into the agriculture sector. Specifically, twelve (12) Member
States – Botswana, Cameroon, Republic of Congo, Ghana, Kenya, Malawi,
Mozambique, Niger, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia – received technical
support to develop project proposals on agriculture adaptation and climate change for
financial support from the Green Climate Fund (GCF).

250. The process of the NEPAD Agency’s accreditation to the Global Climate Fund is
on track. A formal application was submitted in November 2018. This process may take
another one or two years to be successfully completed.

the South African Weather Agency (SAWS), based in Pretoria; and the Mauritius
Meteorological Services in Mauritius. The training helps Member States to produce
information on the state of the environment and natural resources.

256. The Commission trained 1,500 experts from Member States and Regional
Institutions in both technical and policy-oriented fields. Some of the training included in-
situ and satellite-based weather and environment monitoring, processing and
dissemination of environment and climate information.

257. The Commission further mobilized additional resources from the European Union
amounting to €52million to enhance the generation and provision of accurate, tailored,
and timely climate information and enable Member States to address climate change
related issues in the areas of agriculture and food security, disaster risk reduction,
energy, health, and water resources. This activity will be carried out through the
implementation of the Global Framework for Climate Services (GFCS) under the
Integrated African Strategy on Meteorology (weather and climate services).

                 The Great Green Wall for the Sahara and Sahel Initiative

258. During the period under review, the Commission collaborated with the SADC
Secretariat to develop a strategy for the implementation of the concept of the Great
Green Wall for the Sahara and the Sahel Initiative in Southern Africa. The objective is to
help the Southern region enhance its efforts in combating land degradation and
desertification and build resilience in its dry lands. Support was also provided to the
Governments of Cameroon and Ghana to develop national action plans for the
GGWSSI.

259. Meanwhile, the Commission’s Department of Rural Economy and Agriculture
continued its engagement with partners, including the UNCCD, on resource mobilization
to support the activities of the GGWSSI. Through these activities, the Government of
the Republic of Ireland pledged support for the initiative and will contribute over
€1,400,000 for various activities, including the detailed assessment studies of the
impact of the GGWSSI a decade on. In addition, discussions are at advanced stage for

                                                                                 Page 45

financing the development of strategy for the implementation of the Initiative in the
SADC region.

                Multilateral environmental agreements (MEAs)

260. The Commission’s Department of Rural Economy and Agriculture organized a
workshop in Khartoum in August 2018, on the synergistic implementation of MEAs and
related obligations. The Commission also developed tools and guidelines for the
integrated management of waste, including hazardous chemicals, as well as the
integration of biodiversity into national planning and development policy processes. The
guidelines have since been used by Burkina Faso, Gabon, Liberia and Zambia to draft
their respective programmes on integrated management of wastes, including hazardous
chemicals.

                African regional strategies on disaster risk reduction and
                 programme of action for implementation of Sendai Framework
                 2015-2030 in Africa

261. The Commission’s Department of Rural Economy and Agriculture carried out
several activities during the course of the year 2018 which resulted in the adoption of
the monitoring and reporting framework for the Programme of Action for the
implementation of the Sendai Framework by the 6th High-level Disaster Risk Reduction
meeting in Tunis in October 2018. The “Tunis Declaration” has been submitted for the
endorsement of the Policy Organs at the February 2019 AU Summit.

262. The Commission developed and published the first report for the programme on
“Building disaster resilience to natural hazards in sub-Saharan African regions,
countries and communities”. The report entails achievements made on disaster risk
reduction within the framework of building disaster resilience in Africa. The report is now
publicly available and will help raise awareness on the work of the Union in disaster risk
reduction in Africa.

                Implementation of Water and Sanitation (African Water 2025)
                 initiatives in line with the AU Heads of State and Government
                 June 2008 Sharm El Sheikh Commitment

                Sustainable forest and land management

265. Twenty-six (26) Member States have demonstrated commitment to the
implementation of the African Forest Landscape Restoration Initiative (AFR100), with
86% (about 86 million hectares) of degraded land committed for land restoration. They
are as follows: Benin, Burundi, Cameroon, CAR, Chad, Côte d'Ivoire, DRC, Ethiopia,
Ghana, Guinea, Kenya, Liberia, Madagascar, Malawi, Mozambique, Nigeria, Niger,
Republic of Congo, Rwanda, Senegal, Sudan, South Africa, Eswatini, Togo, Tanzania
and Uganda. The AFR100 Secretariat, which is housed at the NEPAD Agency, is now
fully functional.

266. During the period under review, the NEPAD Agency launched the <nepad.org>
portal for regional flagship programmes to showcase the progress made in the
coordination and implementation of regional flagship projects for the African Ministerial
Conference on Environment (AMCEN). Continued support in this area resulted in the
launching of Africa Environmental Partnership Platform (AEPP), which is now functional.
AEPP’s first partnership platform was launched in Nairobi in September 2018.

G.    INVESTING IN THE AFRICAN PEOPLE, ESPECIALLY THE YOUTH, WOMEN
      AND CHILDREN

      I.    Science, Technology and Innovation Driven Education

                Implementation of STISA – 2024

267. Following the adoption by the Assembly in June 2015, of the Alliance for
Accelerating Excellence in Science in Africa (AESA), the Commission set up a
Committee of ten (10) Heads of State as Champions on Education, Science, and
Technology – Chad, Gabon, Egypt, Kenya, Malawi, Mauritius, Namibia, Senegal, Sierra
Leone and Tunisia.

268. Efforts were made to produce a new strategy for health research and innovation
to support operationalisation of the Africa Health Strategy 2016-2030. The strategy is in
progress for further review and validation.

269. During the year under review, the NEPAD Agency completed the report on Africa
Innovation Outlook. The report provides insight analysis of selected key Science and
Technology Innovations (STI) performance indicators in general and Science
Technology Innovation Strategy for Africa (STISA) 2024, in particular. It highlights
performance of Research and Development (R&D) and innovations and consolidates
information from eight (8) countries – Botswana, Egypt, Ethiopia, Mozambique,
Namibia, South Africa, Eswatini and Uganda) out of the twenty-three (23) countries that
conducted R&D surveys.

270. The NEPAD Agency also provided training on R&D and Innovation, focusing on
National Statistics Offices and Science Granting Councils from fifteen (15) countries,
namely Botswana, Burkina Faso, Côte d’Ivoire, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Malawi,

                                                                               Page 47

Mozambique, Namibia, Rwanda, Senegal, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe,
with the aim of raising awareness of STI and R&D indicators and equipping the
countries with requisite skills for developing and implementing systems for tracking
these indicators.

271. These Member States also received training on the revision of the data collection
instruments for both R&D and Innovation. As a result, nineteen (19) – the fifteen above
and four others, namely Egypt, Mali, Seychelles Eswatini – have now adopted a system
for measuring and tracking the utilization of STI indicators.

272. The African Union High Level Panel on Emerging Technologies (APET)
presented its recommendations to the African Innovation Summit that was held in Kigali
in June 2018, on how to harness the following three emerging technologies for
sustainable transformation: (i) gene drives for control and elimination of malaria; (ii)
drones for increasing agricultural transformation; and (iii) micro-grids for community
empowerment. The recommendations were endorsed by the Executive Council during
the January 2018 Summit and reports on the three technologies were launched in June
2018, at the Africa Innovation Summit.

                Pan-African University (PAU)

273. The Government of Cameroon and the Commission signed the host agreement
for the PAU rectorate in Yaoundé in April 2018, in accordance with the Assembly’s
decision Assembly/AU/Dec.552(XXIV) of January 2015. The handing over ceremony
was held on 31 July 2018, marking the official relocation of PAU Rectorate from Addis
Ababa.

274. The PAU Planning and Coordination meeting took place in Nairobi in June 2018.
The meeting reviewed the state of activities at PAU and assessed the progress made
towards making it an effective academic tool for the appropriate development of human
capital in Africa.

275. Ms. Audrey Nthabiseng Ogude was elected as the Vice-President of the Council
of the PAU in July 2018. The Executive Council also approved the budget of the Pan-
African University for the year 2019. It amounts to US$16,209,157, of which
$13,387,180 for the program budget and $2,821,977 for the operational budget.

276. The Pan-African University continued to grant degrees in its four institutes.
Graduation ceremonies took place in the Pan-African University Institute for Life and
Earth Sciences, including Health & Agriculture (PAULESI), the Pan-African University
Institute for Governance, Humanities & Social Sciences (PAUGHSS), the Pan-African
University Institute for Basic Sciences, Technology & Innovation (PAUSTI) and the Pan-
African University Institute for Water & Energy, including Climate Change (PAUWES). A
total of 327 students – 237 males and 90 females – graduated from the Pan-African
University Institutes. Of these graduates, 295 and 32 were awarded Masters’ and
Doctoral degrees, respectively.
-----------------------Page 50 End-----------------------

                                                                       EX.CL/1134(XXXIV)
                                                                                 Page 48

277. A call for applications in the various PAU institutes was launched for the 2018-
2019 academic year. A total of 13,048 applications were received from fifty-three (53)
Member States, out of which 77.93% were male and 22.07% were female applicants.

278. On the whole, a total of 919 students – 29.2% female and 70.8% male – pursued
their studies in the four PAU Institutes. For 2018-2019, the Pan-African University is
committed to raise female representation to at least 40% of all admitted students.

279. Since its inception in 2014, the Pan-African University has received financial
support from partners to fund its programs. While the Commission welcomes donor
financial contributions and some increased support from Member States, the budget
ceiling of US$ 16,209,157 set for the PAU is a challenge to its capacity to develop world
class teaching and research programs as well as scaling up student numbers. While
initiatives are under way to attract new partners, Member States are encouraged to
increase their support both in cash and kind, in order to enhance the realization of the
objectives of developing a world class African University.

                Implementation of CESA

280. The Commission’s main activity in 2018 on the implementation of the Continental
Education Strategy for Africa (CESA) was to ensure Member States’ ownership of
CESA. This objective was accomplished through the launching of four new CESA
Thematic Clusters Platform, namely the Thematic Clusters on (i) Peace and Education
in March 2018); (ii) on TVET in April 2018; (iii) on Early Childhood Care and Education
in September 2018; and on Curriculum in December 2018. This was in addition to the
already existing eight (8) Thematic Clusters launched before 2018. Each Cluster has a
roadmap, and a coordinating team of Member States and agencies that, among others,
submit biannual reports to the Commission.

                 o     CESA, Girls and Women’s Education in Africa

281. The African Union International Centre for Girls and Women Education in Africa
(AU/CIEFFA) carried out several activities in favor of access by girls and women to
education. CIEFFA developed a Strategic Plan (2018-2020) comprising four axes: (i)
legal framework for girls’ rights to education; (ii) gender-sensitive teaching and learning
environments; (iii) STEM-focused TVET; and (iv) advocacy and communication.

282. AU/CIEFFA also organized the Second High-Level Dialogue (HLD) on
“Enhancing policies and practices to promote Science, Technology, Engineering and
Mathematics (STEM) focused Technical Vocational Education Training (TVET) for
women and girls”, which was held in Addis Ababa in January 2018, for African Ministers
of Education, Gender, and Finance. Participants identified best practices to boost girls’
and women’s interest in STEM and TVET areas, and reconfirmed political support for
women in STEM-focused TVET, an area that is male-dominated.

283. A Consultative Meeting of Ministers of Gender in New York in March 2018 on the
margins of the 62nd Session of the Commission on the Status of Women (CSW62) in
New York. Participants discussed challenges and opportunities in achieving gender

equality and the empowerment of rural women and girls.

284. Consultations with the RECs, the Pan-African Parliament (PAP) and other AU
Organs and Specialized Agencies in Midrand, South Africa, in May 2018, which resulted
in the validation and operationalization of a framework for monitoring the
implementation of existing instruments and policies on girls and women’s education in
Africa. This event also helped popularize CIEFFA among members of the Pan African
Parliament and encouraged cooperation with the African Commission on Human and
People’s Rights (ACHPR) and the African Committee on the Rights and Welfare of the
Child. Participants also recommended the appointment of a Special Rapporteur for Girls
and Women’s Education in Africa.

285. AU/CIEFFA held in Dakar in November 2018, a training of teacher trainers
workshop on STEM in cooperation with UNESCO, for over twenty teacher trainers from
Francophone countries.

286. An Innovation Expo on Education was also held in Dakar in October 2018, under
the theme “Meeting Continental Targets for Inclusive, Quality and Transformative
Education and Training in the 21st Century”. It showcased technical and social
innovations in the areas of education and training.

287. AU/CIEFFA co-organised with the United Nations Girls Education Initiative
(UNGEI) and the Global Partnership for Education (GPE), a capacity-building workshop
on Gender Responsive Education Sector Planning in Nairobi in November 2018. The
meeting recommended, among others, a multi-sectoral sensitization on gender-
responsive education sector planning and the development of a three-year gender-
sensitive education sector implementation plan.

                 o    CESA, IPED and Education Planning

288. During the reporting period, l’Insitut Panafricain pour l’Education pour le
Développement (IPED) led the drafting of the CESA Indicators’ Manual, along with the
development of a monitoring and reporting framework. As a result, the first
comprehensive evaluation of CESA implementation is scheduled for 2019. A platform
for management information systems for education, science and technology and
innovation was developed by the Commission’s Department of Human Resources,
Science and Technology in partnership between AOSTI, IPED, NEPAD and the
Association for the Development of Education in Africa (ADEA).

                Higher education       scholarship,    harmonization     and   quality
                 assurance

289. In implementation of the AU Strategy for Harmonisation of Higher Education, the
Commission, with the support of the European Union, continued its support in building
the capacity of African universities to establish vision-based competence-oriented
curriculum development processes while providing a mechanism for comparability of
credit. So far 200 universities from 43 Member States have been involved in this effort.
The second phase of the project ended this year, with publication of the curricula.

290. The Continental African Standards and Guidelines for Quality Assurance in
higher education was also completed. A consolidated report on the third institutional
evaluations using the African Quality Rating Mechanism (AQRM) for 15 higher
education institutions was published. Efforts will be exerted in 2019 to ensure that
AQRM becomes a regular tool for promoting continuous quality assurance. The
Association of African Universities, as the coordinating agency for the Higher Education
Cluster, will ensure continuing promotion of the AQRM and the African Standards.

291. In 2018, the Mwalimu Nyerere AU Scholarship Call was focused on young
women pursuing STEM studies at Masters and PhD levels. Twenty (20) new students
were selected competitively and the first semester payment was done on their behalf.
Since the launch of this scholarship programme, the Commission has sponsored about
250 students studying in African universities, mostly outside their own countries. As
2019 will be the year of refugees, returnees and displaced persons in Africa, efforts will
be made to include young people living as refugees among the awardees.

292. The EU-sponsored Intra-Africa Academic mobility programme, a partner
programme of the Commission, completed the selection process for the fourth call. So
far 1255 Africans have received full or partial scholarships for Masters, PhD and staff
mobility schemes under this programme.

                Teacher development

293. The recommendations of the study on Teacher Training, Working and Living
Conditions in Africa, which was requested by the Assembly in July 2014, were under
implementation. As the coordinator of the Teacher Development Cluster, UNESCO
International Institute for Capacity Building in Africa (IICBA) has been instrumental in
implementing CESA and the teacher study recommendations.

294. During the period under review, the Commission finalized a Continental Teacher
Mobility Protocol (CTMP) in partnership with UNESCO IICBA. The CTMP is necessary
to assist in managing teachers’ mobility from regions and countries that are over-
supplied to those in great need. In order to strengthen teacher regulatory agencies, the
Commission initiated the development of a Continental Teacher Qualification
Framework in partnership with the African Federation of Teacher Regulatory Agencies
(AFTRA) to inform the needed mutual verification of qualifications, as is being done in
the SADC region. Continental standards and guidelines for the teaching profession
were also developed to enhance professionalism in this sector.

      II.   Social Development – Social Welfare, Vulnerable Groups and Drug
            Control

                Social Protection

295. As a follow-up to the recommendations of the STC on Social Development,
Labour and Employment, the Commission developed the Draft Protocol on the Rights of
Citizens to Social Protection and Social Security and submitted it for review to the
-----------------------Page 53 End-----------------------

                                                                      EX.CL/1134(XXXIV)
                                                                                Page 51

African Commission on Human and People’s Rights (ACHPR). The draft was first
discussed during the ACHPR’s extraordinary session in August 2018. It was validated in
November 2018, and will be reviewed by the STC on Social Development, Labour and
Employment in March 2019.

296. The Commission also developed the Draft Social Agenda 2063 that aims to give
effect to the social objectives of Agenda 2063 and other relevant AU instruments in the
social development area. The draft was validated in November 2018 and will be
submitted to the STC on Social Development, Labour and Employment in March 2019.

                Child marriage

297. The Campaign to End Child Marriage continued its efforts to address the issue of
child marriage in Africa by implementing several activities. Led by the AU Special
Rapporteur on Ending Child Marriage, the AU team carried out four campaign post-
launch visits in Egypt, Eritrea, Mozambique and Zambia, respectively. The purpose was
to observe the progress made by the Member States that have launched the Campaign
in implementing their national strategies on ending child marriage and inquire about the
level of protection of the girl child against child marriage. The visits also provided an
opportunity for the AU team to assess the role of governments and other stakeholders
in ending child marriage.

298. As a result of the Commission’s advocacy efforts, the following twenty-four (24)
Member States have launched their campaigns to end child marriage and other harmful
practices: Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Chad, Democratic Republic of the Congo,
Eritrea, Ethiopia, Gabon, Ghana, the Gambia, Kenya, Lesotho, Liberia, Madagascar,
Malawi, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Sudan, Uganda, Zambia and
Zimbabwe.

299. The second annual meeting of the Civil Society Organisations Reference Group
to the AU Campaign took place in Addis Ababa in May 2018 to prepare the 2 nd African
Girls’ Summit on Ending Child Marriage and develop a roadmap on the Campaign’s
direction beyond 2018.

300. The Commission and the Government of Ghana co-organized the Youth Pre-
Summit and the 2nd African Girls’ Summit on ending child marriage and other harmful
practices in Accra in November 2018 under the theme “Enough with silence”.
Participants addressed several issues of concern to adolescents’ sexual and
reproductive health, gender-based violence, and enhancing the role of the youth in
combatting child marriage and other harmful practices.

301. Furthermore, the Commission, in collaboration with UN Women and the
International Telecommunication Union, launched the African Girls Can Code Initiative.
This four-year initiative (2018-2022) aims to enhance the mastering of ICT for girls and
women and, therefore, increase their contribution to Africa’s innovation in this sector.
The first coding camp was held in Addis Ababa in August 2018 and involved 88 girls
from 32 African Member States who were trained on ICT and programming skills.

                                                                                   Page 52

302. On its part, the African Committee of Experts on the Rights and Welfare of the
Child (ACERWC) worked with the African Commission on Human and People’s Rights
(ACHPR) in the launching of the Joint General Comment on Ending Child Marriage. The
aim is to elaborate on the nature of State Party obligations that arise from Article 6 (b) of
the Maputo Protocol and Article 21 (2) of the African Charter on the Rights and Welfare
of the Child, which prohibit child marriage. The Joint General Comment describes the
legislative, institutional and other measures that should be taken by State Parties to give
effect to the prohibition and to protect the rights of those at risk or affected by child
marriage.

                 Older persons

303. The Commission, through the Department of Social Affairs, continued its
advocacy efforts for the ratification of the Protocol to the African Charter on Human and
Peoples’ Rights on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in Africa and the Protocol to
the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights on the Rights of Older Persons in
Africa, to demonstrate Member States’ commitment to the dignity, empowerment and
the rights of persons with disabilities across the continent. The Kingdom of Lesotho has
become the first Member State to ratify the Protocol on Older Persons while the Central
African Republic has become the first Member State to sign the Protocol on Disability.

304. As regards the disbanded African Rehabilitation Institute (ARI), the Commission
has disbursed partial payments – approximately US$200,000 – towards the liquidation
of the emoluments of former ARI staff. The Commission continues to follow up with the
remaining seventeen ARI Member States to make their contributions so that payments
of the former staff’s final entitlements can be completed. They have still not been paid
their separation salaries.

                 Labor, Employment and Social Protection – Ouaga + 10
                  Declaration and Plan of Action on Employment, Poverty
                  Eradication and Inclusive Development

305. The First Five Year Priority Program on Employment, Poverty Eradication and
Inclusive Development 2017-2022 - (5YPP) places a focus on decent job creation for
youth and women, aiming at achieving more inclusive growth and sustainable poverty
eradication.

306. With 10 to 12 million young Africans entering the labor force each year, job
creation in Africa is an urgent challenge. Regrettably, growth in Africa has not generated
enough jobs to achieve large-scale poverty reduction. As a result, many young people
are disproportionately employed in the informal sector. The implementation of the 5YPP
in 2018 yielded the following outcomes:

307. Establishment of the Employment and Social Cohesion Fund (ESCF): A
feasibility study was conducted in 2017 under the supervision of the Commission, the
UN-ECA and ILO to clarify the conditions under which the ESCF could be established.
The findings were submitted to the Specialized Technical Committee (STC) on Finance,
-----------------------Page 55 End-----------------------

                                                                     EX.CL/1134(XXXIV)
                                                                               Page 53

Monetary Affairs, Economic Planning and Integration in Addis Ababa in April 2018. As
requested by the STC, an additional study on the operationalization and implementation
mechanism was subsequently undertaken and submitted to the F15 Ministers of
Finance and a joint meeting of the Bureaus of the Specialized Technical Committees on
Finance and Labour for onward submission for the consideration of the Policy Organs at
the February 2019 Summit.

308. Promotion of decent work in the micro, small and medium sized enterprises in
the informal economy: The Commission began the implementation of a five-year project
under the title “Decent Work for the Transformation of the Informal Economy: Growing
the Micro, Small and Medium Sized Enterprises’ (2018-2022)”. The project is in
partnership with the NEPAD Agency, the African Capacity Building Foundation and
Women in Informal Economy, Globalization and Organization (WIEGO). Five pilot
countries – Cameroon, Kenya, Senegal, Tanzania and Zambia – received technical
support from the Commission and the ILO for the development and implementation of
their respective national projects. Capacity building support was also provided to
Cameroon, Ghana, Kenya, Senegal, Sudan, Tanzania and Zimbabwe. Preparations
were also under way for the production in 2019 of the “First Informal Economy Statistics
Report in Africa”.

309. Domestication of the Declaration and Plan of Action on Employment, Poverty
Eradication and Inclusive Growth, and their First Five Year Priority Programme (2017-
2021): The Commission worked with ECOWAS on the domestication in the ECOWAS
region of continental policy frameworks on employment. ECOWAS adopted its new
policy framework aligned with the AU framework. The other RECs, namely SADC, EAC,
IGAD, COMESA and ECCAS, took part in the exercise to learn about the domestication
process.

310. Promotion of Public-Private Partnerships Frameworks on Decent Jobs Creation
for Inclusive Growth: The Assembly adopted in January 2015 the Public Private
Partnership Framework (PPPF) on Jobs Creation and Inclusive Development
[Assembly/AU/Decl.6(XXIII)]. The Commission, working with Business Africa and the
ECOWAS Employers’ Organization, adopted a roadmap in Dakar in November 2018, on
engaging Member States and regional employers’ organizations in implementing PPP
frameworks.

311. On its part, the NEPAD Agency assisted four (4) Member States – Benin,
Cameroon, Malawi and Niger – in the development of their national action plans on
youth employment and skills development, with a special focus on rural economic value
chains. All four (4) Member States piloted a catalytic set of interventions through the
Africa Solidarity Trust Fund to design, develop and implement youth capacity
development projects. Sixteen (16) young people from the four countries participated in
peer learning and knowledge exchange visits on rural youth employment and
entrepreneurship in the areas of agriculture and agribusiness. A total of 178 youths (44
in Benin, 91 in Cameroon and 43 in Malawi) were trained on agriculture value chain
enterprises. In addition, 20 business plans (5 in Benin, 10 in Cameroon and 5 in Malawi)
were subsequently developed and submitted for funding.
-----------------------Page 56 End-----------------------

                                                                      EX.CL/1134(XXXIV)
                                                                                Page 54

312. The NEPAD Agency also disbursed the amount of USD1.3 million as a
contribution to the implementation of Business Incubation for African Women
Entrepreneurs (BIAWE) in ECOWAS and COMESA. The following Member States
benefitted from the contribution: Burkina Faso, Burundi, Kenya, Sierra Leone, Sudan,
Eswatini.

                Migration and Development

313. The following activities were carried out under the AU-ILO-IOM-ECA Joint
Program on Labour Migration Management for Development and Integration (JLMP).

314. JLMP Three Year Priority Project (2018-2022): This project was implemented
with the Kingdom of Sweden’s financial support of US$9 million. The objective is to
improve the governance of labour migration to achieve safe, orderly and regular
migration in Africa.

315. Second edition of the Labor Migration Statistics Report in Africa: The report was
launched on the margins of the UN Conference on the Global Compact for Safe,
Orderly and Regular Migration in Marrakech in December 2018. The first report
published in March 2017 covered thirty-seven (37) national statistic offices. By contrast,
only fifty (50) contributed statistics and data for the second report.

316. Operationalization of the AU Labour Migration Advisory Committee: The
Committee held its inaugural meeting in Dakar in May 2018, during which it adopted its
rules and procedures and roadmap for the next three years. It comprises
representatives of the RECs, social partners’ organizations, the Pan African Parliament,
ECOSOCC, women cross borders traders, the Academia and international partners
such as ILO, IOM and ECA.

317. Social security access and portability for migrant workers: Within the framework
of the JLMP, the ILO began in February 2018 the implementation of a two-year project
on social security access and portability for migrant workers, covering the three
geographic priority area RECs – EAC, ECOWAS and SADC. Funded by the EU with €2
million, the project is coordinated by the Commission as a component of the AU-ILO-
IOM-ECA Joint Programme.

318. Communication strategy on labour migration: As per the JLMP, a labour
migration communication strategy was adopted with the participation of all the RECs,
social partners organizations ie ILO, IOM and ECA. The Commission’s Directorate of
Information and Communication will coordinate the overall implementation of the
strategy. The objective is to promote and protect the rights of migrant workers.

319. On its part, the Pan-African Parliament continued its sensitization campaign on
the AU policy frameworks on migration and labour migration, in particular the renewed
Migration Policy Framework and the AU Common Position on Global Compact for Safe,
Orderly and Regular Migration. The Pan-African Parliament also advocated for the
fostering of labour mobility within and from Africa.

                                                                                Page 55


                Human trafficking

320. In its decision EX.CL/987(XXXII) of January 2018, the Executive Council
requested the Commission to sustain, replicate and extend the operational mechanisms
of the AU Horn of Africa Initiative (AU-HoAI) to other trafficking and smuggling routes
across the continent and other regions.

321. The AU Horn of Africa Initiative covers three migratory routes, namely (i) the
Eastern Route – through Djibouti, Northern Somalia, Yemen and eventually Saudi
Arabia and other Middle Eastern countries; (ii) the Northern Route – through Sudan,
Egypt, Libya, into Europe; and (iii) the Southern Route – through Kenya, Tanzania,
Zambia, Malawi, Zimbabwe, Mozambique into South Africa.

322. The Executive Council also requested the Commission to expedite the
establishment of the Regional Operational Centre in Khartoum (for sharing information
on human trafficking and migrant smuggling) and the Training Centre for Law
Enforcement in Cairo, and to facilitate the participation of other Member States not part
of the AU-HoAI and the RECs upon their request.

323. At the time of this reporting, the Commission was in the process of establishing
the Regional Operational Centre in Khartoum and the African Migration Observatory in
Morocco. The Khartoum Center will facilitate regional cooperation of law enforcement
partners in the fight against human trafficking and smuggling through the exchange of
information and intelligence among countries of origin, transit and destination in close
collaboration with AFRIPOL, INTERPOL and other regional bodies. The Morocco
Center, on its part, will focus on migration data collection and information exchange and
coordination among Member States in order to effectively address the challenges of
migration flows in Africa.

                AU Horn of Africa Initiative on Human Trafficking and Smuggling
                 of Migrants

324. The Commission convened in Maseru in December 2018, a workshop on
«Fostering Dialogue and Collaboration between the AU Horn of Africa Initiative (AU-
HoAI) and the Southern Africa Development Community (SADC) in Addressing Irregular
Migration on the Southern Migratory Route». The meeting provided a platform for
Member States of the AU-HoAI and SADC to deliberate and share experiences on
addressing irregular migration with a view to establishing collaborative mechanisms to
address irregular migration (specifically human trafficking and migrant smuggling) along
the southern migratory route.
325. In addition to recommendations on collaboration between the AU-HoAI and
SADC Member States in the areas of prevention, protection and prosecution in
combating human trafficking and migrant smuggling, participants recommended the
formalization of the inter-regional dialogue on migration under the auspices of the
Commission and the title of The Africa Inter-Continental Dialogue on Migration
(AIDoM). Participants also proposed that the dialogue should include other RECs. The
Africa Inter-Continental Dialogue on Migration’ could form the basis for the Pan-African
Forum on Migration.

                                                                      EX.CL/1134(XXXIV)
                                                                                Page 56


326. The Commission also contributed to enhancing coordination and collaboration for
a better management of irregular migration through the combined efforts of the Tripartite
Task Force comprising the AU-EU-UN that was set up in 2017 to resolve the situation in
Libya. Since its establishment, the Task Force has facilitated the return or resettlement
and evacuation of 20,138 migrants and refugees to their countries of origin and other
countries, respectively. The figure includes 1,334 persons that the UNHCR evacuated
from Libya to Niger in order to fast-track the processing of their resettlement claim.
Continued engagements with the Libyan authorities have resulted in the dismantling of
twenty-four (24) detention centres.

327. Furthermore, the Commission organized in Addis Ababa in November 2018, a
joint workshop with the EU and Member States from Africa and Europe to better
address the plight of returnees in Africa. Participants raised the need for Continental
Return, Re-admission and Reintegration Guidelines that take into account, among
others, the needs of individuals and communities of return.

328. As a follow-up to the Joint Valletta Action Plan on Migration adopted by Heads of
State and Government of Africa and Europe in Valletta, Malta, in November 2017, and
in furtherance of the Declaration of the 5th AU-EU Summit of November 2017, the
Commission co-organized in Addis Ababa in November 2018 the meeting of African and
European senior officials on the Joint Valletta Action Plan 2018. Among others, the
meeting confirmed the overarching role of the regional processes (Rabat and Khartoum
Processes and the AU Horn of Africa Initiative) in addressing irregular migration in the
West and Horn of Africa regions and further encouraged their coordination.

                Migration policy framework for Africa and Plan of Action 2018-
                 2030

329. In view of the ever-growing number of migrants and the complexity of migratory
movements within and across Africa’s regions, the Executive Council adopted the
Migratory Policy Framework for Africa (2018-2030) and its Plan of Action (2018-2030)
by its decision EX.CL/987(XXXII) of January 2018. The 2018 MPFA highlights the need
to develop inter-state and inter-regional approaches to managing migration in Africa
through the development of clear objectives, providing opportunities for exchange of
experiences, views and best practices, and working towards the coordinated
implementation of policies and programmes. Furthermore, the MPFA recommends the
need to speak a ‘common language’ when addressing migration and forced
displacement issues as a critical step, and one that is on-going and evolving.

330. Since the adoption of the Migration Policy Framework for Africa, the Commission
made efforts to popularize it among Member States, the RECs and other stakeholders,
including through the organization of regional workshops for the Southern Africa, West
and Central Africa, and East and North Africa regions. Participants, among others,
identified the challenges that militate against the coherent management of migration in
their respective countries/RECs, and proposed actions to ensure coherence and
momentum on this issue. More than 300 hard and soft copies of the MPFA were
distributed to Member States, RECs, CSOs and partners on this occasion.
-----------------------Page 59 End-----------------------

                                                                       EX.CL/1134(XXXIV)
                                                                                 Page 57


331. The Commission conducted an assessment of the capacity needs of Member
States and the RECs to manage migration as part of a broader continental capacity
building effort for Member States and the RECs. The assessment report was validated by
Member States and will form the basis for a 5-year continental capacity building
programme in the area of migration governance.

332. Since about 80% of African migration occurs within the African continent, it is
paramount that more efforts and resources be channelled towards building the capacity
of Member States and the RECs to manage the phenomenon. It is also important that
Member States and RECs should continue to exchange views on challenges and best
practices among themselves to manage migration issues. Inter-regional dialogue on
migration will bring Member States and RECs closer and enable the Union to speak
with one voice when they dialogue with other regions (especially Europe and the Gulf
States) on migration issues.

      III.   Wellness and Quality of Life

                Medical health regulations

333. Following its endorsement in 2016, the Model Law on Medical Products
regulations has now been adopted by twelve (12) Member States, namely Burkina
Faso, Burundi Côte d’Ivoire, the Gambia Lesotho, Mozambique Namibia, Rwanda
Seychelles, Eswatini, Tanzania, and Zimbabwe.

                African Centre for Disease Control

334. The Assembly, through its decision Assembly/AU/Dec.554 (XXIV) of January
2015, established the Africa Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) as
a specialized agency to support Member States to improve the health of their citizens
through prevention of infection, surveillance and response to emergencies (including
outbreaks, man-made and natural disasters, and public health events of regional and
international concern), and capacity building to reduce disease burden on the continent.
As one of its core functions, the Africa CDC conducted the following activities during
outbreaks in 2018.

335. On 11 May 2018, the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo,
through its Ministry of Health, reported the ninth Ebola outbreak in Bikoro, Equateur
Province, followed on 1 August 2018, with the tenth outbreak in North Kivu and the Ituri
provinces. The 10th outbreak has been considered as the second largest after the West
Africa outbreak. It is still ongoing, with currently 645 cases and a total of 377 deaths.

336. The Africa CDC supported the DRC Ministry of Health to respond to the outbreak
by providing 63 health workers in the following specialities: central support team(11);
national coordination team (4); epidemiologists (24); infection prevention and control
specialists (14); laboratory scientists (4); anthropologist (1); communication experts (3);
data manager (1) and logistician (1).
-----------------------Page 60 End-----------------------

                                                                      EX.CL/1134(XXXIV)
                                                                                Page 58


337. The Africa CDC also supported response activities including surveillance and
contact tracing; infection prevention and control; safe and dignified burials; community
death investigations; and the procurement of six (6) laboratory diagnostic machines
(GeneXperts) with 3,000 testing cartilages for utilisation in Goma, Butembo, Beni,
Mangina and Tshomia areas. The Africa CDC trained 469 local health workers,
traditional healers and teachers in infection prevention and supplied local thirteen (13)
health centres and hospitals with personal protection equipment (PPEs).

338. During the year under review, the Africa CDC also supported the response of
Member States to the following outbreaks: cholera in Cameroun, Zimbabwe and
Malawi; Chikungunya in Sudan, and the Rift Valley fever in East Africa. In Cameroun,
640 cholera cases, including 43 deaths, were reported whilst in Zimbabwe, 9557 cases,
including 55 deaths, and in Malawi 900 cases and 30 deaths were also reported. As for
Rift Valley fever and Chikungunya, 21 cases including 11 deaths, and 13,978 with 11
deaths were reported, respectively. The Africa CDC have supported these countries
through the provision of training workshops in various areas and procurement of
laboratory kits and consumables.

339. The Africa CDC, in collaboration with other partners also developed and
reviewed the basic package of the training materials that will be used for capacity
building of Member States in Public Health Emergency Operations Centres (PHEOC).
Three countries – Somalia, South Sudan and Zambia – undertook baseline assessment
process to identify the current situation, gaps and area for support and improvement.
Technical documents such as legal framework for PHEOC and manual for developing
PHEOC handbook are under revision.

340. The Africa CDC continuously scans official and media sites weekly to detect and
assess events of public health significance. High quality data about the number and
causes of death will enable Member States to allocate resources effectively to prevent
avoidable deaths and extend life expectancy. Despite the importance of this data, few
Member States have high quality data for the national and sub-national levels about
causes of death. Of the 55 African countries, 38 (69%) did not produce any reliable data
on causes of death from 2010 to 2016.

341. To address this situation, the Africa CDC held meetings with the Bill and Melinda
Gates Foundation in April (Seattle) and June (Addis Ababa) 2018 to develop a proposal
on how it can assist Member States in building their capacity to collect more reliable
data about the number and causes of death. It is encouraging to note that the Africa
CDC was awarded $2.6 million, effective 1 January 2019, to hire two personnel, work
with Member States on a Framework for Mortality Surveillance, and support initiatives in
selected Member States for improving mortality surveillance.

342. The Africa CDC also held a continent-wide workshop to identify high priority
activities for implementing the Africa CDC Framework for Antimicrobial Resistance
Control. The workshop included partners from across the continent, representing human
and animal health sectors.

                                                                         EX.CL/1134(XXXIV)
                                                                                   Page 59

343. The Africa CDC, in collaboration with UNAIDS, developed a platform for
integrating routinely collected health surveillance data. The “Situation Room” is a
platform run by UNAIDS that permits UNAIDS to directly access the “District Health
Information System” (DHIS) within seven (7) Member States to provide detailed reports
about disease incidence, management, and program for TB, HIV, and related
conditions. In May 2018, UNAIDS and the Africa CDC held a workshop with seven
Member States – Côte d’Ivoire, Kenya, Lesotho, Namibia, Uganda, Zambia and
Zimbabwe – to review a proposal on expanding the Situation Room to include collection
and analysis of epidemic-prone diseases, such as cholera, typhoid fever, meningitis,
yellow fever, and measles. A continental meeting planned for November 2018 to
present this data to all Member States and gain support for expanding the Situation
Room to other Member States was postponed to February 2019.

344. The Africa CDC strengthened and expanded the network of National Public
Health Institutes (NPHI) and developed standards to guide and monitor the
establishment of NPHIs in Africa. The Africa CDC, in collaboration with the IANPHI, has
produced several publications, including a National Public Health Institutes monitoring
card, to support and strengthening NPHIs on the Continent Two consultants were
engaged to provide technical support to Member States, namely Kenya, Madagascar,
Somalia and South Sudan, in the process of establishing functional NPHIs.

345. Strengthening Africa’s clinical and public health laboratory systems and networks
is among the key objectives of the Africa CDC’s laboratory systems and network pillar.
In March and May 2018, the Africa CDC held two regional meetings, in Libreville for the
Central Africa region and Lusaka for Southern region, respectively. The objective was to
identify, prioritize and advocate for effective and efficient interventions for strengthening
of national and regional laboratory systems, improving quality standards and promoting
laboratory networks.

346. These meetings provided the Africa CDC with an opportunity to obtain a buy-in
from Member States on the mapping of laboratory assets within the Member States,
assessments of countries status in relation to national laboratory strategic plans and the
status on existing national and regional laboratory networks within the two regions. This
information was necessary for effective planning and execution of laboratory systems
and network strengthening activities in the regions.

347. Subsequently in November 2018, a Regional Integrated Surveillance and
Laboratory Network (RISLNET), which aims to harness existing public health assets in
each of the five AU regions, was officially launched in Central Africa. The Africa CDC,
through the Commission’s procurement process, recruited a partner namely Global
Health Systems Solution (GHSS) to support the implementation of RISLNET activities in
Central Africa. Subsequently, the Africa CDC in collaboration with GHSS organized in
Brazzaville in November 2018, the 1st laboratory quality management systems (QMS)
training for 35 laboratory managers from six countries: Chad, Congo Brazzaville,
Central African Republic (CAR), Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Equatorial
Guinea, and Gabon. Other workforce development trainings included laboratory quality
management training for Malawi and Zimbabwe in support during the Cholera
outbreaks.

390. The Malabo Declaration on Youth Employment provided a springboard for
discussions on youth unemployment and underemployment. Several other frameworks
have been introduced to address this issue within Agenda 2063’s call for a skills
revolution in Africa. One such framework is the Plan of Action for the African Decade for
Technical, Professional, Entrepreneurial Training and Youth Employment (2019-2028),
which is a roadmap for accelerated implementation of the continental strategy for TVET
to foster youth employment. By regularly aligning TVET programmes with labour market
requirements, the Plan of Action seeks to enhance the relevance and quality of the
African TVET systems (formal, informal and non-formal) for equipping youth and adults
with the skills required for (self) employment, decent work, entrepreneurship and lifelong
learning. It also aims to address key issues hindering TVET development and youth
employment, including the need for re-orienting the African TVET systems to address
mismatch between education and training and labour market needs through high quality
learning experience and coherent policies at the continental, regional and national
levels.

391. The STC on Youth, Sports and Culture (STC-YCS) met in Mahe, Seychelles, in
December 2018, to finalize the development of the Africa Plan of Action for Youth

the role they would like the authorities and other stakeholders involved in child issues to
play towards the realization of the 2018 DAC theme.

396. It will be recalled that the Executive Council, meeting in its 33 rd ordinary session
in Nouakchott in July 2018, adopted the theme “Humanitarian Action in Africa:
Children’s Rights First” for the commemoration of the 2019 Day of the African Child.

397. The period under review witnessed an increase in reporting by Member States
on their implementation of the African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child. Of
the forty-eight (48) States that have ratified the Charter, thirty-seven (37) have
submitted their initial reports, and nine (9) have submitted their first and second periodic
reports. Furthermore, during its 31st session held in Bamako in April and May 2018, the
ACERWC considered four State Party Reports and two Complementary Reports from
Burkina Faso, Burundi, Malawi and Niger, and from Nigeria and Zambia, respectively.

398. The ACERWC also developed four Concluding Observations and
Recommendations for the attention of concerned Member States. These tasks are
mandated by Articles 43, 44 and 45 of the ACRWC Charter.

399. The ACERWC continued its advocacy efforts for the signing and ratification of
the African Charter for the Rights and Welfare of the Child. Fruitful discussions in this
regard were held in Mogadishu in July 2018 with the Government of the Federal
Republic of Somalia and other stakeholders involved on child issues, to encourage the
ratification of the Charter. As a result, the Government of Somalia committed to hasten
the ratification process, while partners in the country promised to support the
Government in this endeavour.

400. In the coming year, the ACERWC will continue its lobbying efforts for the
universal ratification of the African Charter for the Rights and Welfare of the Child, and
monitor the measures adopted by Member States to implement it. The ACERWC will
also increase the number of advocacy visits and expand them to States Party and other
organs regarding allegations of violations of children’s rights.

401. Member States are encouraged to extend their full cooperation to the ACERWC,
including by adopting, without further delay, the amendment to Article 5 of the Protocol
to the African Charter on Human and People’s Rights to allow the ACERWC access to
the African Court of Human and People’s Rights.

      V.    Gender

                 Gender Strategy

402. The year under review witnessed several activities in support of gender equality
and women’s empowerment. During its 30th ordinary session, the Assembly decided to
achieve full 50/50 gender parity and to reserve 35% of posts to the youth in all AU
-----------------------Page 71 End-----------------------

                                                                      EX.CL/1134(XXXIV)
                                                                                Page 69

Organs by the year 2025 [Assembly/AU/Dec.687(XXX)]. To implement this decision, a
Parity 2025 project was initiated and held its first meeting in Dakar in July 2018, to
agree on the way forward.

403. The Commission completed the evaluation of the 2009 AU Gender Policy. The
outcome will inform the implementation of the new AU Strategy on Gender Equality and
Women’s Empowerment, which was adopted by the Executive Council –
EX.CL/Dec.1012(XXXIII) – during the June-July 2018 Summit in Nouakchott. The new
Strategy and its Operational Plan will be launched during the 2019 February Summit in
Addis Ababa.

404. 2018 also marked the fifteenth anniversary of the Protocol to the African Charter
on Human and Peoples Rights on the Rights of Women in Africa, also known as the
Maputo Protocol. So far, forty-one (41) Member States have ratified it, with the Federal
Democratic Republic of Ethiopia as the latest to submit its instruments of ratification in
July 2018.

405. The Commission, in collaboration with the Special Rapporteur on the Rights of
Women in Africa, UN partners and the Solidarity for African Women’s Rights (SOAWR)
coalition, organized at AU headquarters in Addis Ababa in December 2018, a High-
Level Consultation on the Ratification, Domestication and Implementation of the Maputo
Protocol by States Yet to Ratify the Protocol. Participants took the opportunity to design
a roadmap for the In-Country Advocacy Missions that will commence in 2019 to
Member States that are yet to ratify the Maputo Protocol. This event was followed by
the commemoration, on 14 December 2018, of the 15th Anniversary of the Maputo
Protocol to celebrate the achievements made so far in the realization of women’s rights
and launch the “All for Maputo Program”.

406. In the same vein, the Commission initiated a Continent-wide Campaign on
Ending Violence Against Women and Girls, in furtherance of the implementation of AU
and international instruments to promote and protect women’s rights against violence.
The Campaign’s official launch will take place during 2019.

407. To mark the International Women’s Day (IWD) on 8 March 2018, and the Pan-
African Women’s Day (PAWD) on 31 July 2018, the Chairperson of the Commission
issued statements celebrating women’s achievements and contributions to Africa’s
development and calling for greater collective action to fast-track the implementation of
agreed commitments on gender equality and women’s empowerment. Furthermore, in
his opening remarks during the Joint AU/EU High Level Meeting in Nouakchott in June-
July 2018 on Women in Power, the Chairperson of the Commission reiterated the need
to shift focus from rhetoric to action, results and greater accountability and adequate
resourcing for gender equality and women’s empowerment.

408. The African Women Leaders Network (AWLN) convened at AU headquarters in
April 2018 its Second Women Leaders Forum for Africa’s Transformation, in
collaboration with UN-WOMEN and the Office of the Special Envoy of the Chairperson
of the Commission on Women, Peace and Security. A Plan of Action was developed to
enhance the leadership of African women in bringing transformative changes focusing
on peace, security and development in Africa.

                                                                     EX.CL/1134(XXXIV)
                                                                               Page 70


409. The Fund for African Women (FAW) contributes to women’s economic
empowerment by providing financial supports to women’s grassroots organizations.
During the period under review, an amount of US$2 million was disbursed to 119
organizations across the continent. From 30 January to 7 February 2018, two field visits
were undertaken by the members of the Fund’s Steering Committee and the staff of the
Commission’s Women and Gender Development Directorate to Nigeria and Namibia, to
assess the progress made in the implementation of the projects that were funded under
the FAW theme “fighting poverty and promoting economic empowerment of women and
entrepreneurship”. The information collected during the field visits contributed to the
development of the booklet on the FAW’s achievements.

410. The Solemn Declaration on Gender Equality in Africa (SDGEA) is an
accountability and reporting tool on how Member States and the Commission implement
gender equality commitments. In 2018, a synthesis report of eleven (11) Member States
and a report of the Chairperson of the Commission were endorsed by Policy Organs in
Addis Ababa. Concerned about the low number of reports from Member States, the
Executive Council, in its Decision EX.CL/Dec.1009(XXXIII) of June 2018, appealed “to
the Member States that are yet to submit their reports to do so urgently.” A framework
for the online reporting system is under development by the Women and Gender
Development Directorate to facilitate this process and encourage the sharing of best
practices on issues pertaining to gender equality and women’s empowerment.

411. The Office of the Special Envoy of the Chairperson of the Commission on
Women, Peace and Security convened at AU Headquarters in Addis Ababa in March
2018, a meeting of the twenty-three (23) Member States and RECs that have developed
National and Regional Action Plans on UN Security Council Resolution 1325 for the
validation of the Continental Results Framework (CRF) on Women, Peace and Security.
The Continental Results Framework was validated in March 2018 and adopted by the
Peace and Security Council in May 2018.

412. The Commission, through the Women, Gender and Development Directorate,
continued to coordinate the integration of AU’s policy position on gender equality and
women’s empowerment in global decision-making processes. In collaboration with UN
Women and the UN Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA), the Africa pre-
consultation meeting for the UN Commission on the Status of Women (CSW) was held
in Addis Ababa in February 2018. The meeting developed a consolidated Africa
Common Position on the themes of the CSW’s 62 nd session, and a coordinated African
strategic advocacy to influence the Agreed Conclusions of the CSW session. The
consultation meeting was preceded by multi-stakeholder national and regional
consultations across the continent led by Ministries responsible for Gender Equality and
Women’s Affairs, as well as by the RECs and civil society organizations (CSOs).

413. The Commission, through the Women and Gender Development Directorate,
hosted in Addis Ababa in November 2018, the 2nd FemWise-Africa Induction Training,
the 3rd FemWise-Africa Executive Steering Committee Meeting, as well as the 2nd
FemWise-Africa General Assembly. These events brought together around one
hundred FemWise-Africa members who were trained during the 1st FemWise-Africa
-----------------------Page 73 End-----------------------

                                                                      EX.CL/1134(XXXIV)
                                                                                Page 71

induction training session in June 2018, the FemWise leadership and other leaders in
the area of women, peace and security.

414. Implementation of agreed commitments on gender equality and women’s
empowerment remains one of the key challenges to the full realization of women’s
rights in Africa. Member States are therefore encouraged to allocate the requisite
resources to their national gender institutions to enable them to carry out their work in
accordance with the decisions of the AU Policy Organs.

415. Likewise, multiple reporting on various international and regional instruments
contributes to reporting fatigue, often characterized by delayed or fewer submissions
from Member States. It is therefore opportune for the Policy Organs to reflect on how to
combine reporting on various instruments into one single national report that covers
multiple international and regional instruments. The Commission stands ready to assist
Member States in this undertaking.

416. Lastly, there is a need for a stronger coordination of AU Member States in the
negotiations and side events of the Commission on the Status of Women (CSW).
Thirteen (13) African countries are members of the 45-strong CSW. Member States are
therefore encouraged to continue to work with the Commission in coordinating their
efforts to achieve African common positions on various issues, in line with the AU
decisions on gender equality and women’s empowerment.

                Pre-Summit gender meetings and high-level panels

417. The 10th session of the AU Gender Pre-Summit was held in Addis Ababa on the
margins of the 2018 January Summit, under the theme “Winning the fight against
corruption: a sustainable path to gender equality and women’s empowerment in Africa”.
The outcome included an outline of actions to be taken at national, regional and
continental levels to accelerate the fight against corruption, as well as performance
plans and terms of reference for each of the gender multi-stakeholder policy platforms,
which formed part of the report on “Enhancing the Performance of WGDD Policy
Platforms”.

418. The Commission also organized High-Level Presidential meetings on the
margins of the 30th and 31st Summits held in Addis Ababa and Nouakchott, respectively.
They included (i) the ‘High-Level Breakfast on Equal Access of African Women in High-
Level Positions at the AU and in the UN System’, which was hosted President Alpha
Conde of Guinea; (ii) the Revival Launch of the East African Region of the Pan-African
Women’s Organization (PAWO), hosted by President Yoweri Kaguta Museveni of
Uganda; and (iii) the High-Level Consultation on the Ratification of the Maputo Protocol
by States Yet to Ratify the Protocol.

419. There was also the AU/EU High Level Consultation meeting on Women in
Power, hosted by President Paul Kagame of Rwanda and AU Chairperson. The
outcome included strengthened commitment to implement parity across the Union, the
establishment of a peer review mechanism for the implementation of policies on gender
equality and women’s empowerment, and the acceleration of the ratification,

                                                                      EX.CL/1134(XXXIV)
                                                                                Page 72

domestication and implementation of Maputo Protocol and other AU instruments on
gender equality and women’s empowerment.

                Maputo Protocol and Women’s Rights

420. The Commission, through the Women, Gender and Development Directorate
(WGDD), convened in Addis Ababa in December 2018, a High-Level Consultation to
accelerate the ratification, domestication and implementation of the Protocol to the
African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights on the Rights of Women in Africa
(Maputo Protocol). The consultation meeting was organized in collaboration with the
Office of the Special Rapporteur on the Rights of Women in Africa (SRRWA) of the
African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights (ACHPR), the Solidarity for African
Women’s Rights (SOAWR), the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for
Human Rights (OHCHR), United Nations Development Program (UNDP) and with the
support of development partners. Forty-one (41) Member States have thus far ratified
the Protocol and are bound to its provisions. However, fourteen (14) have yet to do so.

421. During the meeting, Member States that have not ratified the Maputo Protocol
shared the challenges and opportunities they face with regard to the ratification process.
On the other hand, they gave examples of the legal provisions that they had
promulgated, the programs they had implemented and the institutions they had
established and which, in their view, advance the provisions laid out in the Maputo
Protocol.

422. Three documents were reviewed and adopted over the course of the two days
consultation. They were the All for Maputo Protocol Roadmap, Country Profiles and
their accompanying advocacy strategies (for countries yet to ratify), and the concept
note and action plan for in-country advocacy missions to accelerate ratification.

423. Member States committed to realizing the goal of universal ratification of the
Maputo Protocol by 2020, affirming that its universal ratification, domestication and
implementation will address the myriad of challenges women and girls face across the
Continent, ensuring an environment that allows for their freedom, self-determination and
autonomy free of violence, coercion and discrimination.

424. The High-Level Consultation concluded on 14 December 2018, with the
celebration of the 15th Anniversary of the adoption of the Maputo Protocol and progress
made so far in the realization of women’s rights.

H.    CONTINENTAL POLICIES, FRAMEWORKS AND STANDARDS

      I.    Program for Infrastructure Development in Africa (PIDA)

425. The       Assembly     adopted     a    declaration    in     February    2009    –
Assembly/AU/Decl.1(XII) – requesting the Commission to formulate the Programme for
Infrastructure Development in Africa (PIDA), which was officially launched in Kampala in
July 2010. Subsequently, the Assembly, in its decision Assembly/AU/Decl.2 (XVIII) of
January 2012, adopted PIDA as the reference programme for regional and continental
infrastructure development in Africa.
-----------------------Page 75 End-----------------------

                                                                      EX.CL/1134(XXXIV)
                                                                                Page 73


426. Since then, the Commission, in partnership with the NEPAD Agency, UNECA
and the African Development Bank (AfDB), worked to address the infrastructure deficit.
In addition, initiatives such as the G20 Infrastructure Action Plan, the Infrastructure
Consortium for Africa (ICA), the EU-Africa Infrastructure Trust Fund and the Africa
Infrastructure Country Diagnostic highlight the necessity of regional infrastructure
development for Africa's economic growth.

427. The PIDA Priority Action Plan (PIDA-PAP) portfolio of projects that are prioritized
for implementation from 2012 to 2020 comprises more than 400 projects in 51 cross-
border programmes, covering the four sectors that include transport (235 projects),
energy (54 projects), ICT (113 projects) and trans-boundary water resources
management (9 projects). The capital cost of delivering the PIDA-PAP is estimated at
US$68 billion or US$7.5 billion annually.

428. Member States have taken significant strides in ensuring the implementation of
the PIDA projects. From the 433 individual project fiches, about 32% (131 projects) are
either under construction or already operational, 16% are currently being structured for
tendering, while about 26% have moved from concept to pre-feasibly and feasibility
phases.

429.   So far, implementation of PIDA projects has produced the following results:

       (i)     a total capacity of approximately 16,066 kilometers of roads were built
               throughout the continent;

       (ii)    4,077 kilometers of railway capacity was built through PIDA railway
               projects;

       (iii)   in the energy sector, a total transmission line capacity of approximately
               3,506 KM was added;

       (iv)    thirteen (13) countries – Algeria, Benin, Burkina Faso, Republic of Congo,
               Guinea, Liberia, Malawi, Niger, Sierra Leone, South Sudan, Tanzania,
               Uganda and Zambia – were connected with regional fiber optic cables in
               the ICT sector; and

       (v)     through constructed and operational PIDA projects, respectively 112,900
               and 49,400 jobs were directly and indirectly created.

430. The timeframe of the PIDA Priority Action Plan (PAP) covers the 2012-2020
period. Following the relevant decisions of the STC on Transport, Transcontinental and
Interregional Infrastructure, Energy and Tourism (STC-TTIIET), as well as consultations
with continental and regional partners, the Commission, through the Department of
Infrastructure and Energy, initiated the process of the PIDA Mid-Term Review to take
stock of PIDA implementation to date, highlight the strengths and weaknesses of the
processes and instruments currently in use to achieve the 2020 targets.
-----------------------Page 76 End-----------------------

                                                                        EX.CL/1134(XXXIV)
                                                                                  Page 74

431. Regional consultation workshops were carried out to assess the implementation
of PIDA projects in the Regional Economic Communities (RECs) and Member States.
The outcome will provide guidance on the way to fast-track the implementation of the
PIDA-PAP. It will also provide the basis on how to formulate the PIDA-PAP II (2020-
2030).

432. During the reporting period, the Commission convened four PIDA implementation
governance meetings, including the Steering Committee and the data collection forums.
The meeting of the Reference Group on Infrastructure (RGI), which was jointly
convened with the European Union in Addis Ababa in May 2018, took note of the
positive progress made to date on PIDA and developed the 2018-2020 strategic
infrastructure roadmap. It was also noted that the AU-EU partnership is one of the most
structured of all Africa’s partnerships with implementation mechanisms that are
institutionalized at all levels, from the technical implementation level to the policy and
decision-making at the highest political level which is embodied in the AU-EU Summit of
Heads of State and Government.

433. On its part, the NEPAD Agency convened the first technical meeting in June
2018, on the need for an aggregated financial guarantee scheme to ensure more
investments in PIDA projects. Another technical meeting with the Pension and
Sovereign Wealth Funds was scheduled in the last quarter of 2018. Furthermore, the
NEPAD Agency will promote a few flagship projects using the Infrastructure Project
Preparation Facility with the aim of getting particular institutional investors and Heads of
State and Government to champion the projects, initially along the Batoka Gorge and
LAPSSETT Corridor.

434. The NEPAD Agency continued to provide support to the RECs, including through
the deployment of technical experts to various regions. Two more experts were
deployed to the Union of the Maghreb Arab (UMA) region and one to the Economic
Community of Central African States (ECCAS).

                 PIDA Capacity Building Project

435. In order to ensure smooth implementation of the PIDA PAP (2012-2020), the
Commission and the NEPAD Agency, with the support of the African Development
Bank, initiated the PIDA Capacity Building Project (PIDA CAP). The African
Development Bank provided almost US$9 million for its implementation over three
years.

436. The main objective of the PIDA CAP is to strengthen the capacity of Member
States, through their respective Regional Economic Communities (RECs), as well as
the Commission and the NEPAD Agency, in planning, preparing and coordinating the
implementation of regional infrastructure programmes and projects. Through the
NEPAD Agency, experts have been recruited for all the RECs to support projects
preparation activities in Member States. The Commission is also using the funds of the
PIDA CAP to strengthen its communication strategy, as well as policy interventions in
Member States. The Commission and the NEPAD Agency are in the process of
negotiating a second phase of the PIDA CAP with the African Development Bank.
-----------------------Page 77 End-----------------------

                                                                         EX.CL/1134(XXXIV)
                                                                                   Page 75


437. In addition to the PIDA CAP, the Commission also carried out several capacity
building workshops over the years to support data collection on infrastructure projects in
Member States. These workshops have helped to collect and provide information on
PIDA projects, which are available in the Virtual PIDA Information Centre (VPIC).

                 PIDA Advocacy Efforts

438. Advocacy on PIDA was enhanced in 2018. The Commission’s Department of
Infrastructure and Energy implemented its PIDA Communication Strategy to enhance
awareness on PIDA projects at the national, regional and local levels. The Department
also set up the PIDA Journalists Network whose membership has now reached 40
media outlets from across the continent. The PIDA Journalists Network has taken on
the task of raising the profile of infrastructure development. It is expected to increase
the volume and quality of positive coverage on PIDA’s impact on Africa’s development.

439. As part of its communication strategy for PIDA implementation, the Department
of Infrastructure and Energy carried out training activities for African journalists, in order
to enhance visibility of PIDA projects at the global, regional and national levels. In 2018,
the Department took journalists from across the continent on a tour of the largest
hydropower project in Africa – the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) – as one
of the PIDA Projects at an advanced stage. The visit to the GERD was preceded by a
third media workshop held in Addis Ababa in November 2018, to hone the skills of 24
journalists to effectively cover PIDA projects.

440. Furthermore, as part the annual activities to showcase PIDA projects to
stakeholders, the Department of Infrastructure and Energy, in collaboration with the
Zimbabwean Government, the NEPAD Agency and the Common Market for Eastern
and Southern Africa (COMESA), organized the Fourth (4th) PIDA Week in Victoria Falls
in November 2018. The main objective of the PIDA Week was to showcase progress
made in the implementation of selected PIDA projects, provide a marketing platform to
accelerate their implementation, and address crucial issues around resource
mobilization and enabling environment, among others. The 4th PIDA Week was
attended by over 450 participants.

441. The Commission and the NEPAD Agency held a special briefing for the
Permanent Representatives Committee (PRC) in Addis Ababa on 21 June 2018, to
sensitize Member States on PIDA. As a result of a strong advocacy and sensitization
work, thirty-four (34) PIDA programs out of the existing fifty-one (51) are now included in
national development plans in forty-two (42) Member States.

442. During the meeting of the STC on Transport, Transcontinental and Interregional
Infrastructures, Energy and Tourism, which was held in Lomé in March 2017, Ministers
underscored the potential of regional infrastructure development as a key leverage in
job creation. They requested the Commission and the NEPAD Agency to develop a tool
to estimate, integrate and promote job creation through infrastructure development
under the framework of PIDA. Following up on the Ministerial request, the Commission’s
Department of Infrastructure and Energy and the NEPAD Agency, with the support of
-----------------------Page 78 End-----------------------

                                                                        EX.CL/1134(XXXIV)
                                                                                  Page 76

the German Government through GIZ, developed the PIDA Job Creation Toolkit in
2017. The Commission and the NEPAD Agency will launch the Toolkit in the margins of
the February 2019 Summit.

                 African infrastructure database (AID) and the Virtual PIDA
                  Information Centre (VPIC)

443. The PIDA information management system – comprising the Virtual PIDA
Information Centre (VPIC), the Africa Infrastructure Database (AID), regional (RECs)
databases, and the PIDA monitoring and evaluation (M&E) portal http://www.au-
pida.org – was developed and deployed to provide an update on PIDA implementation.
The PIDA information system is an effective tool for the dissemination of information
and knowledge on PIDA, and the prioritization of infrastructure development at the level
of Member States.

                 PIDA Pilot Smart Corridors

444. Following a consultative session between the NEPAD Agency and the
Government of Kenya, specific projects on the Lamu Port-South Sudan-Ethiopia
(LAPSSET) Corridor were identified, as well as a roadmap and corresponding actions
for accelerated development and financing. The roadmap is in alignment with the Kenya
National Development Plan and the African Union’s 5% Agenda.


445. The Praia-Dakar-Abidjan Multimodal Multisector Corridor development project is
earmarked for the piloting of the PIDA ASII (The African Strategic Infrastructure
Initiative) methodology. The objective is to package the shortlisted projects based on
their relative attractiveness for private sector investment (private finance) and public
investment. It is also to prepare a Corridor Development Investment and Marketing Plan
for projects in the transport, energy, transboundary water and telecommunication and IT
Sectors, which will be selected by experts from the ECOWAS Corridor Member States.
The Project Packaging Consultancy for Selected PIDA-ASII is being finalized

446. Preparations were also in advanced stages at the NEPAD Agency for the
implementation of the Central Corridor Transit Transport Facilitation Agency (CCTTFA).
The initial phase of the project will focus on developing a feasibility study, environmental
impact and social assessment and the development of a resettlement for the section
from the Kalundu port through to the Uvira-Ruberizi road, transecting Tanzania, the
Democratic Republic of Congo, Rwanda and Burundi.

447. The following five PIDA Priority projects were selected, namely: two (2) projects
in the SADC region; one (1) in ECOWAS; one (1) in the EAC; and one (1) in ECCAS.
Project profiles highlighting, inter-alia, specific opportunities for private sector
investments in each of the five projects are currently being developed.

448. The NEPAD Agency developed a Comprehensive Project Status Report for all
ten (10) projects of the Presidential Infrastructure Champion Initiative, namely:

                                                                            EX.CL/1134(XXXIV)
                                                                                      Page 77

      (i)          the missing link of the Trans-Sahara Highway – Algeria;
      (ii)         optic fibre from Algeria to Nigeria, via Niger;
      (iii)        the Dakar-Ndjamena-Djibouti Road/Rail – Senegal;
      (iv)         Nigeria–Algeria gas pipeline: Trans-Saharan Gas Pipeline (TSGP);
      (v)          Kinshasa-Brazzaville Bridge Road/Rail;
      (vi)         the unblocking of political bottlenecks for ICT broadband and fibre optic
                   projects in the neighbouring states;
      (vii)        the establishment of a navigational line from Lake Victoria to the
                   Mediterranean Sea via the River Nile Project (VICMED);
      (viii)       Lamu Port-South Sudan-Ethiopia Transport Corridor project;
      (ix)         the international logistics hub projects. The report is expected to be
                   completed by the end of the year; and
      (x)          the SMART Africa Project

                     PIDA Integrated project for access to basic infrastructure and
                      services for rural/remote areas

449. The Commission, in collaboration with the NEPAD Agency, the UNECA and the
African Development Bank, organized in Addis Ababa in December 2018, a policy
dialogue on PIDA’s regional and continental infrastructure to unlock access to remote
and rural areas of Africa. The objective was to provide a platform for PIDA stakeholders
to create synergies between the different implementation institutions - regional and
continental and other stakeholders – to minimize duplication and maximize the socio-
economic impact of PIDA projects in remote and rural areas. More than 200
participants, including participants from rural communities, took part in the event.

                     PIDA Project on policy and regulation initiative on digital Africa
                      (PRIDA)

450. The Commission set up the PRIDA Technical Assistance and Project
governance. Terms of reference were developed for a need assessment study relating
to the PRIDA’s outputs 2 (ICT policy and regulation) and 3 (internet governance).
Project implementation started in August 2018. The meeting of PRIDA’s global steering
committee took place in Addis Ababa in December 2018 and agreed on the project
implementation modalities.

                     African Internet Exchange Points (AXIS)

451. During the period under review, the Commission set up an internet exchange
point in Mali and awarded US$75,000 to the internet exchange in the Republic of
Congo. Grant agreements were signed with the National Telecommunication Regulatory
Authority of Egypt and Rwanda Internet Exchange.

452. The Commission also processed payment of US$39,870 to Nigeria’s internet
exchange point and a second disbursement of US$45,000 to Internet Exchange in the
Republic of Congo. Gabon’s internet exchange also received a payment of
US$37,855.43.

                                                                                Page 78

      II.   Continental Transport Policy

                Road transport

453. In April 2014, African Ministers of Transport adopted the Malabo Declaration on
Transport Sector Development in Africa, which requested the Commission, among
others, to elaborate a long-term transport strategy for the continent to respond to the
continent’s transport challenges. In response, the Commission prepared a draft
transport policy paper, which set out a common framework for delivering integrated and
sustainable transport at continental, regional and country level.

454. The draft paper was presented to the first meeting of the Ministerial Sub-
Committee on Transport, which was held in Addis Ababa in December 2017. The
meeting agreed that the draft should be finalized as the Continental Transport Policy
framework and submitted to the Policy Organs by the end of 2018.

455. In November 2018, the Commission convened a continental expert workshop to
validate the draft continental transport policy before its adoption by the Specialized
Technical Committee on Transport, Trans-continental and Interregional Infrastructure,
Energy and Tourism (STC-TTIIET) and submission to the July 2019 Summit.

456. Similarly, the Malabo Declaration adopted the Intergovernmental Agreement on
harmonisation of norms and standards of the trans-African highway network (TAH) and
its five (5) annexes. The ministers requested the Commission to ensure rigorous
application of the standards to avoid non-compliance with the burden at the axle, which
is at the origin of the massive destruction of the road heritage. They stressed that this
Agreement is also essential for the facilitation of trade throughout the continent.

457. The objective of the Intergovernmental Agreement and its Annexes is to establish
minimum norms and standards for the design and maintenance of the trans-African
transport network, to contribute to the integration and the physical, political, economic
and social cohesion of Africa, and ensure road transport facilities between major
production and consumption areas on the continent. Its implementation will allow the
interoperability of the continental road transport networks, thus contributing to the
smooth implementation of the AfCFTA, reduce traffic accidents, minimize the harmful
effects of infrastructure on the environment, and avoid high costs of road maintenance.

458. The Commission organised in Addis Ababa in October 2018, a continental
experts workshop to consider, among others, the ratification and implementation of the
Intergovernmental Agreement on TAH. Amon other outcomes, the meeting agreed on a
roadmap to accelerate the ratification and implementation of the Intergovernmental
agreement. The roadmap recommended the launching of the working group on TAH,
intensify advocacy on the ratification and implementation, and ensure an appropriate
capacity building for the various stakeholder.
-----------------------Page 81 End-----------------------

                                                                      EX.CL/1134(XXXIV)
                                                                                Page 79

                Road Safety Action Plan

459. In connection with recommendation 64/225 of the General Assembly of the
United Nations of 2 October 2010, adopting a Plan of Action for Road Safety for the
2011-2020 Decade of Action, the African Ministers of Transport, at their meeting held in
Luanda in November 2011, adopted the African Road Safety Action Plan.

460. The Ministers also adopted the Luanda Declaration which, among others,
proclaimed the third Sunday of November, which is currently the World’s Remembrance
Day for road accident victims, as the African Road Safety Day. They also requested the
Commission to prepare an African Road Safety Charter. The Commission and the
UNECA were also assigned the task to follow up and report on the implementation of
continental road safety instruments, including organising regular meetings on road
safety in Africa. The Luanda ministerial declaration was endorsed by the Executive
Council Summitin January 2012 [EX.CL/682(XX)].

461. As a follow-up, the Commission had repeatedly encouraged all Member States to
ratify the African Road Safety Charter adopted by the Assembly during the January
2016 Summit. The latest communication was sent to Member States in June 2018. In
addition, as a prelude to the African Road Safety Day (18 November 2018), an
information note and a celebration guide was distributed to all Member States,
reminding them to celebrate the Road Safety Day in their respective countries at the
highest possible levels.

462. The African Road Safety Observatory and Minimum Road Safety Indicators are
being developed with the support of UNECA and Africa Transport Policy (SSATP), as
recommended by the STC-TTIIET.

463. The Commission initiated a mid-term evaluation of the implementation of the
African Road Safety Action Plan. It brought together experts from Member States to
take stock of progress made in this area and assess the extent to which the objectives
of the action plan can be achieved by 2021. The evaluation started in November 2018
and is expected to be completed by the end of February 2019.

464. The major challenge is currently the signing and ratification by all Member States
of the African Road Safety Charter, as well as the operationalisation of the African Road
Safety Observatory. As of this reporting, only four (4) Member States have signed the
African Road Safety Charter – the Comoros, Ghana, Sierra Leone and Zambia – and no
Member State has ratified it.

465. On its part, the Commission will continue to advocate for the implementation of
the African Plan of Action for the Decade of Road Safety and complete the
establishment of the African Road Safety Observatory.

                The Revised African Maritime Transport Charter

466. The Revised African Maritime Transport Charter was adopted by the Assembly
[Assembly/AU/Dec.293(XV)] in Kampala in July 2010. The Revised Charter has been
formulated as an overall continental policy on maritime transport to facilitate trade
-----------------------Page 82 End-----------------------

                                                                        EX.CL/1134(XXXIV)
                                                                                  Page 80

between Africa and the rest of the world. However, since its adoption, the Revised
Charter has received only nine (9) ratifications, namely Benin, Burkina Faso, Congo,
Ethiopia, Gabon, Kenya, Mauritius, South Africa, and Togo.

467. The Commission organised in Addis Ababa in October 2018, a maritime experts
consultation meeting on the ratification and implementation of the 2010 Revised African
Maritime Transport Charter. The Consultative meeting adopted a roadmap to
accelerate the full ratification and implementation of the 2010 Revised African Maritime
Transport Charter. The roadmap recommended the revival of the oversight committee
as provided for in article 44 and to intensify advocacy on ratification of the Charter. It
may also be opportune for Member States to consider the designation of Champions to
spearhead the ratification of the Charter and identifying focal points at national and
RECs levels.

468. The Commission also revived the Strategic Task Force for the Implementation of
the 2050 Africa’s Integrated Maritime Strategy that was established in 2014. The Task
Force met in May and August 2018, to consider eight (8) Draft Annexes to the African
Charter on Maritime Security and Safety and Development in Africa (Lomé Charter),
which were developed in 2017 in the areas of (i) Definitions; (ii) General Provisions; (iii)
Living marine resources; (iv) Extraction of non-living resources; (v) Climate and
Environmental Sustainability; (vi) Poverty Eradication, Employment and Social
Development; (vii) Blue Economy; and (viii) Cabotage.

469. The Task Force met again in October 2018, to validate the Draft Annexes and
circulate them to all Member States for comments. The Commission plans to submit
them for the consideration of the various STCs and, finally, to the Policy Organs through
the STC on Justice and Legal Affairs.

470. Pursuant to Executive Council Decision EX.CL/Dec.822 (XXV) of June 2014, the
Commission set up an interdepartmental team for more coordinated action on maritime
matters. In addition, the Commission and UNECA organized a side event during the
Blue Economy Summit in Nairobi in November 2018, to foster increased wealth creation
from Africa’s oceans and seas through a sustainable and thriving maritime economy.

      III.   Geothermal Energy

                 Operationalization of the Geothermal Risk Mitigation Facility

471. The Geothermal Risk Mitigation Facility (GRMF) was established in 2012 by the
Commission with the support of the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation
and the European Union Africa Infrastructure Trust Fund, which is managed through the
German Development Bank (KfW). In 2014, the UK Department for International
Development (DFID) added its contribution to the GRMF, bringing the total size of the
Facility to approximately USD115 million. Originally, the Facility was planned for a
period of five years. It has now been extended to 2021 because the funds have not yet
been fully spent due to delay in the implementation of the projects that were awarded
GRMF grants.
-----------------------Page 83 End-----------------------

                                                                        EX.CL/1134(XXXIV)
                                                                                  Page 81

472. From 2012 to 2018, five applications rounds were completed and grants totaling
US$117.5 million were awarded to thirty (30) projects with a potential of 2,783 MW. The
planned investment volume by geothermal developers for the 30 projects is estimated at
USD9.2 billion.

473. The main challenge facing the GRMF is the delay in the implementation of the
projects that received grants, due, among other reasons, to delays in award of licenses,
signing of power purchase agreements and high cost of infrastructures to access the
project sites. The Commission maintained regular consultations with the GRMF-focused
countries, as well as the developers of those projects, to resolve these challenges and
accelerate the implementation.

                 Development of sustainable energy in small island developing
                  states (SIDS) in Africa

474. African island states have unique concern in addressing energy issues because
of their location. Currently, they are highly dependent on fossil fuels and the majority
spends in excess of 30% of their foreign exchange earnings annually on importing fossil
fuels.

475. The concept of Renewable Energy in Small Island States was developed and
validated by the Heads of Renewable Energy in African Island States. Terms of
reference to implement the concept were also approved and the implementation
initiated. A validation workshop was organized in Addis Ababa in August 2018, and
requests for proposals advertised in September 2018. The bids are presently under
evaluation.

      IV.   Electricity Standards

                 Africa Energy Information System

476. The African Energy Commission (AFREC), in 2018, continued working on the
African Energy Information System and Database (AEIS) and the dissemination to
Member States, the RECs and other international institutions.

477. AFREC published “2018 Africa Energy Database“ in October 2018. Work on
energy efficiency indicators for residential sector will be published in March 2019.
Meanwhile, AFREC conducted four regional training workshops on data collection for
energy statistics and energy efficiency residential sector for the five African regions. The
workshops were organized within the framework of capacity building of focal points of
Member States, the RECs and the Regional Power Pools.

                 Harmonization of regulatory frameworks for electricity market in
                  Africa

478. The Commission launched the project on “Harmonized Regulatory Framework
for Electricity Market in Africa” in 2015-2016, with the development of a Strategy and
-----------------------Page 84 End-----------------------

                                                                      EX.CL/1134(XXXIV)
                                                                                Page 82

Action Plan. The Strategy and Action Plan were approved by the Specialized Technical
Committee of Ministers for Transport, Trans-continental and Inter-regional
Infrastructure, Energy and Tourism (STC-TTIIET) in Lomé in March 2017, and by the
Executive Council in its decision EX.CL/1024(XXXI) of June- 2017.

479. Implementation of the Strategy and Action Plan commenced in May 2017, and
was completed in March 2018, with the adoption by the Energy Sub-Committee of the
STC-TTIIET in Nouakchott in July 2018, of a continental transmission system tariff
methodology, as well as policy and technical models of mini-grids. The Coordination
Unit within the Commission’s Department of Infrastructure and Energy began its
operation in 2018, with the development of guidelines for Minimum Energy Performance
standards and Energy Labelling Schemes for Africa.

480. There is a delay, however, in the implementation of the third phase of the Action
Plan because it took longer than anticipated to confirm the funding and recruit the
consultants. Slow recruitment of staff has also delayed the operationalization of the
Coordination unit.

481. To overcome the unavailability of sufficient data for the MEPS and Energy
Labelling assignment, the Commission is working closely with the Regional Centers for
Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency and the UN Union for Energy Efficiency
(U4E). Efforts were made towards strengthening working relations with the RECs,
Power Pools and Regional Centers for Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency in the
implementation of the projects that have been initiated.

482. Finally, it is important to note that funding for these projects is much dependent
on external donors, mainly the EU. The contribution of Member States is therefore
crucial to ensure financial stability in the implementation of these important projects.

                Electrical infrastructure standards

483. The membership of the African Electrotechnical Standardization Commission
(AFSEC), through National Electrotechnical Committees, increased to sixteen (16) –
Côte d’Ivoire, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Egypt, Ethiopia, Ghana, Guinea,
Kenya, Namibia, Nigeria, Rwanda, Senegal, South Africa, Sudan, Tunisia, Zambia and
Zimbabwe. AFSEC’s sixth general assembly was held in July 2018, where several key
resolutions were made.

484. The 3rd Africa Smart Grid Forum (ASGF) was held in Kigali in October 2018.
Progress was observed in several Member States towards the application of smart grid
technologies since the 2nd ASGF held in 2016. Continued and increased support of
partner organizations was evident with proposals to conclude new MoUs in November
2017 with African Forum for Utility Regulators (AFUR) and the International Council on
Large Electric Systems (CIGRE), respectively, to promote the application of AFSEC
recommended standards.

485. The Egyptian government’s commitment to host the AFSEC headquarters in
Cairo has been implemented, with the forthcoming appointment in January 2019 of an
Executive Secretary to replace the part-time volunteer who was acting in that capacity in
-----------------------Page 85 End-----------------------

                                                                     EX.CL/1134(XXXIV)
                                                                               Page 83

South Africa since AFSEC’s inauguration in 2008. Furthermore, office space has been
allocated and support staff assigned.

      V.    Africa Renewable Energy Initiative (AREI)

                Operationalization of Africa Renewable Energy Initiative (AREI)

486. The African Renewable Energy Initiative (AREI) was launched by the African
Ministerial Conference on the Environment (AMCEN) at the June 2015 Summit and the
COP 21 in Paris in December 2015. AREI targets are to facilitate the development of 10
GW new capacity of renewable energy sources installed by 2020, and 300 GW by 2030.

487. The AREI Board of Directors – consisting of five Heads of State and Government
representing the five AU regions – provisionally approved for attribution 24 investment
programs and projects with an expected total production capacity of 1.7GW for a total of
€4 billion of already planned investments. These investments were prepared with the
support of several technical and financial partners, notably the European Union, the
French Development Agency (AFD), the KfW Group, the European Investment Bank
(EIB), and the African Development Bank (ADB). The majority of these projects are
currently undergoing the tender process.

488. Regional consultation meetings were organized for Central and East African
regions in Nairobi in July 2018, and in Cairo in October 2018, respectively. The
consultation meetings for other regions were scheduled to be held before the end of
2018. The purpose of the consultation meetings is to initiate work on roadmaps to
remove barriers and create the necessary conditions for operationalizing appropriate
project portfolios to enable the Board of Directors to take appropriate measures to
accelerate their implementation. The next meeting of the Board of Directors was
scheduled for January 2019.

                Bioenergy development in Africa

489. The African Bioenergy Framework and Policy Guidelines were adopted by the
Executive Council in January 2013 – EX.CL/Dec.748(XXII). The purpose of the
Framework was to: (i) build consensus on shared framework and provide guidance to
individual countries and regions in developing bioenergy policies and regulations; and
(ii) enhance awareness among African policy makers and civil society about the need
for more environmentally friendly and socially acceptable bioenergy development
policies.

490. The Commission’s Department of Infrastructure and Energy, in collaboration with
United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA), developed a concept paper
in May 2018 for designing regional bioenergy strategies and investment plans. In June
2018, consultancy services were advertised for developing regional bioenergy
development strategy and investment plans for the East and Central Africa regions.
The contract for Eastern Africa was awarded to Dr. Bothwell Batidzirai in August 2018,
while the one for Central Africa went to Dr. Bemba Diop in September 2018. Both
-----------------------Page 86 End-----------------------

                                                                      EX.CL/1134(XXXIV)
                                                                                Page 84

consultants were expected to finish their assignment by 31 December 2018. The
Commission also initiated resource mobilization for similar assignments for the
Southern, Western and Northern regions.

491. The development of bioenergy resources on the continent requires that Member
States prioritize their bioenergy sector, make available adequate funds for bioenergy
project development, and strengthen working relations with the RECs and the Regional
Centres for Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency.

                Small Hydropower and Solar Energy Development

492. Hydropower and solar energy are proven and internationally-recognized as
sources of clean energy. This is particularly more so now that the global community is
now prioritizing solar and small hydropower to cater for increasing energy demands and
improved energy access.

493. Due to many barriers and constraints, Africa has not yet fully benefitted from this
transition. Africa is among the regions that receive the highest insolation in the world.
Yet, as of 2016, its total installed solar photovoltaic capacity stood at just over 2GW,
which is less than one percent of the global solar installed capacity (estimated at
300GW).

494. Recognizing the huge potential of these two energy sources for Africa and their
ability to contribute to energy access at low cost with high impact, the Commission
designed in February to July 2018, a program for small hydropower and solar energy
development. Implementation of the program has commenced with resource
assessment of small hydropower potential and development of solar energy policy
framework. It is expected to be completed by mid-2019.

495. As regards hydropower development, the NEPAD Agency held discussions in
Victoria Falls in June 2018 with Southern Africa Power Pool (SAPP), to support the
synergistic integration of the Batoka, Inga Dam III, and ZTK projects resulting in an
agreement to wait for the approval of the SAPP Masterplan for guidance. These
discussions involved three RECs (SADC, COMESA and EAC), and four Member States
– the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kenya, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe.

496. Efforts were initiated to strengthen the North African transmission line and
support the creation of a regional energy market platform. In this regard, engagement
with Arab Maghreb Union (UMA)) and the North Africa power pool is planned for later in
the year.

497. The NEPAD Agency also provided technical and financial support of renewable
energy pilot projects at national level. They included financial closure of the 6MW wind
project in The Gambia, solar application to public buildings in Madagascar, and small
islands mini-grids in Tanzania.

498. This support facilitated the commencement of energy audits for heavy industries
in Rwanda and Tanzania. The audits are expected to be completed in the second half of
-----------------------Page 87 End-----------------------

                                                                      EX.CL/1134(XXXIV)
                                                                                Page 85

2019. Furthermore, scoping missions and resource mobilization were underway in
Uganda and Burundi for identification of energy efficiency and renewable energy
projects.

      VI.   Comprehensive ICT Strategy for Africa (CISA)

                Continental e-governance framework

499. The Commission, in collaboration with the Government of Sudan, hosted the
2018 African Internet Governance Forum (AfIGF) in Khartoum in November 2018.
Meanwhile, the website of the Internet Governance Forum was moved from
<www.afigf.org> to <www.afigf.africa>, that is, DotAfrica.

500. The Commission developed an e-Governance Framework and an e-Government
Platform (Toolkit) for Member States. An MoU was also signed in the margins of the
AU-EU Summit in Abidjan in November 2017, with the Government of Estonia on
assistance with e-governance training.

                DotAfrica

501. The Commission and the South African Central Registry (ZACR) lawyers met
with the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) - a non-profit
organization responsible for the maintenance of databases related to the allocations of
 names and numerical spaces of the Internet - to prepare for the hearing on the
litigation on Dot Africa about the transparency of the process followed by ICANN to
delegate DotAfrica gTLD to ZACR on behalf of the AU, and the legitimacy of the claim
of DCA, an opponent of ZACR that applied for Dot Africa. The Commission and ICANN
are awaiting the date of the trial in a United States court in California. The goal is to
dismiss DCA for good and forever. Meanwhile DotAfrica is operational and is being
used by more than 17,000 entities around the world.

502. The Commission also hosted the meeting of the African Internet Registrars held
in Addis Ababa in November 2018.

                Cybersecurity

503. Cybersecurity remains a serious concern for the AU. As part of its efforts to
address the threats related to IT security, the Commission conducted its first threat
assessment in collaboration with the Host Country. The assessment uncovered serious
breaches caused, among others, by the AU’s unsecured network, the vulnerability of its
website, and staff members’ lack of awareness of IT security requirements. If left
unaddressed, these security issues may cause weak access control and expose the AU
network to malicious activities by intruders. The Commission intends to give a higher
priority to cybersecurity in the years ahead pursuant to Executive Council’s decision
EX.CL./Dec.987(XXXII) of January 2018, requesting the Commission to implement
cybersecurity as a flagship project of Agenda 2063.

sector and called for the formulation and full implementation of a continental tourism
strategy, as well as the establishment of the African Tourism Organization. In particular,
the Sub-Committee expressed concern about the implementation of the revised tourism
action plan, especially the coordination of activities and assignment of responsibilities
between the key stakeholders, namely the Commission, the RECs, Member States, the
NEPAD Agency, UNECA and the World Tourism Organisation. It urged the Commission
to disseminate the revised tourism action plan, as adopted, and prepare a budget for
coordination of activities.

       VIII. Harmonization of Statistics in Africa: setting up statistical institutions
             and implementation of SHaSA II

Zimbabwe. The Commission also embarked on capacity building of Election
Management Bodies in Madagascar, Mali and Zimbabwe, including a financial
contribution of USD100,000 to both Madagascar and Mali during the preparation of
presidential elections.

521. Overall, there was a notable improvement in election management in these
countries. However, incidents of electoral violence and contestations of election results
remain high in some places, while voter turnout varied from 30 to 90%.

522. The Commission provided technical assistance to the Association of the African
Electoral Authorities (AAEA) in developing strategies for strengthening the AAEA and
make it more relevant and responsive to the needs of election management bodies
(EMBs). In addition, the Commission’s Department of Political Affairs and the
Association of the African Electoral Authorities convened the 5th annual continental

democracy, governance and human rights. The Sub-Committee will begin its work in the
first quarter of 2019.

                Constitutionalism and the Rule of Law

525. During the period under review, the Commission provided technical assistance to
the Governments of the Gambia, South Sudan and Somalia on constitution-building
processes. The assistance was aimed to help the three Member States ensure that their
ongoing constitution-building processes were inclusive and responsive to management
of diversity.

526. During a meeting held in Accra in June 2018, the Commission, through the
Department of Political Affairs, launched a new programme on the institutional
strengthening of political parties in Africa, with a view to inculcating and entrenching a
culture of democracy, political pluralism, constructive management of diversity,
tolerance, and peace on the African continent. The programme’s exploratory and
feasibility study have been validated, and the guidelines and key priorities finalised and
identified.

                Participatory government and local governance

Public Service Day in their respective countries in June 2018, under the theme «
Combating corruption in the public service institutions through stakeholder participation
and promotion of ethical leadership to realise the objectives of Agenda 2063 and the
SDGs”.

529. Furthermore, the Commission embarked on ratification and domestication
campaigns of the African Charter on Values and Principles of Public Service and
Administration, which adopted in January 2011. So far, thirty-eight (38) Member States
have signed and eighteen (18) have ratified it. The Commission convened the first
conference of State Parties in November 2018, which adopted the guidelines to assist
State Parties in reporting on the implementation of the Charter.

530. The Human Settlements and Urban Development Sub-Committee of the
Specialized Technical Committee (STC) on Public Service, Local Government, Urban
Development and Decentralisation held a side event on the margins of the World Urban
Forum in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, in February 2018. Discussions focused on the way

                                                                                 Page 90

531. The Commission, through the Department of Political Affairs, organised in
Nairobi in July 2018, a technical consultation on the preparation of a Draft Model Bill on
Urban Development and Human Settlements. This meeting was followed by a
ministerial regional meeting in Entebbe in November 2018, which validated the
Harmonized Regional Framework for the Implementation, Monitoring and Reporting of
the New Urban Agenda in Africa. The framework was officially adopted at the STC’s
third ordinary session in December 2018.

532. On the operationalization of the High Council of Local Authorities (HCCL), as
requested by the executive Council in its decision EX.CL./Dec.993(XXXII) of January
2018, the Commission submitted a report to the Structure and Budget Subcommittee of
the PRC on the structural, financial and legal implications for the operationalization of
the High Council of Local Authorities (HCCL). A request was sent to the Subcommittee
to register the item on the agenda of its consideration before the February 2019
Summit.

                The Fight against Corruption

533. The AU Convention on Preventing and Combating Corruption was adopted in
2003 and entered into force in 2006. To date, forty-nine (49) Member States have
signed it while forty (40) have ratified it. By proclaiming the year 2018 as the year for
combating corruption (Project 2018), the Assembly renewed its determination to win the
fight against corruption and set Africa on a sustainable path to its transformation. Two
Member States – the Republic of Angola and the Republic of Mauritius – were the latest
to ratify the Convention in 2018.

534. The AU Advisory Board on Corruption (the Board) led the Union’s efforts in this
endeavour. Several activities were carried out in collaboration with Member States and
other AU Organs, and under the leadership of President Muhamadu Buhari of the
Federal Republic of Nigeria as Champion for the theme of the year. One main highlight
of Project 2018 was the Africa Anti-Corruption Dialogue held in Arusha in October 2018,
during which participants deliberated on the development of an African Anti-Corruption
Measurement that will be specifically tailored to the realities of the African continent. A
key outcome of the dialogue was the development of an African Corruption
Measurement paper.

535. The AU Advisory Board on Corruption held advocacy meetings in Botswana,
Egypt, Mauritius, Rwanda, South Africa, Tanzania and Uganda alongside other existing
meetings to raise awareness about the theme of the year and amplify Member States’
efforts in fighting corruption. One of the key outcomes of consultations and advocacy
meetings is the proposal to establish an African Youth Communities of Practice on Anti-
Corruption. The activities increased the Board’s visibility and a greater public awareness
of the AU architecture for fighting corruption. As a result, the Board’s Twitter social
media page grew from 50 followers in March 2018 to 1,000 followers by the end of
November 2018.
-----------------------Page 93 End-----------------------

                                                                      EX.CL/1134(XXXIV)
                                                                                Page 91

536. The AU Advisory Board on Corruption launched a continental study to review the
state of implementation of the AU Convention on Preventing and Combating Corruption
with a view to ensuring universal ratification and its full implementation by Member
States. The Board worked with the RECs in order to identify emerging trends on
corruption as well as draw lessons on good practices in fighting corruption.

537. The Board also conducted evaluation missions to Namibia in September 2018
and Rwanda in November 2018, as part of the key activities of Project 2018. The
assessment missions reviewed how Member States are complying with, and
implementing the provisions of the AU Convention on Preventing and Combating
Corruption.

538. Within the framework of the African Governance Architecture (AGA) youth
engagement strategy, the Commission convened three regional youth consultations
aimed at mobilizing youth across the five regions, inviting them to join the fight against
corruption. These consultations were held in Gaborone in August 2018 for East and
Southern Africa, in Dakar in September 2018 for West and Central Africa, and in
Casablanca in September 2018 for North Africa. They culminated with the convening in
Abuja in December 2018, of the Anti-Corruption Youth Congress by President
Muhammadu Buhari of Nigeria and the Champion for the Anti-Corruption Year. The
Youth Congress in Abuja was preceded by the Women’s Forum and an AGA-led High-
Level Dialogue, both of which took place in Gaborone in November 2018 under the
auspices of President Mokgweetsi Masisi of Botswana.

539. Participants in these consultations stressed the need for renewed political will to
implement them. They also stressed the need for expanded civic spaces at national
levels, to enable the meaningful participation of African citizens in the fight against
corruption. They called for universal signature, ratification, domestication and
implementation of the AU Convention on Preventing and Combating Corruption and
urged Member States to enact progressive laws that protect whistle-blowers of corrupt
practices. In view of the limited space for interaction among anti-corruption youth
networks and activists at the continental and regional levels, participants resolved to
organize themselves through an African Youth Community of Practice and Anti-
Corruption (AYCPAC), which will facilitate, among other things, south-south and north-
south sharing of experiences and comparable lessons in engaging young people in the
fight against corruption.

540. Trade union leaders from twenty-seven (27) Member States met in Dar-es-
Salaam in August 2018, under the auspices of the Commission and the Organization of
African Trade Union Unity (OATUU), to exchange views on “Development and
Transformation of Africa through Good Governance: the Role of Trade Unions in
Winning the Fight against Corruption”. Participants commended the AU Declaration on
the year 2018 as the African anti-corruption year and pledged their commitment as
trade union leaders to contribute to the fight against corruption on the continent and the
realization of Agenda 2063.

                                                                                  Page 92

541. During the year under review, Member States took strong steps in the fight
against corruption at the continental and national level. At the Nouakchott Summit in
July 2018, the Assembly’s Declaration on the African Anti-Corruption Year –
Assembly/AU/Decl.1(XXXI) – provides a roadmap for advancing the collective fight
against corruption. Key commitments include empowering national anti-corruption
agencies, combating all forms of illicit financial flows, and speeding up the
implementation of the recommendations of the High-Level Panel on Illicit Flows.

542. At the national level, Nigeria’s anti-corruption body, the Economic and Financial
Crimes Commission (EFCC), had reportedly recovered N794 billion, US$261 million,
£1.1 million; €8,168,871 and 407 mansions from fellow Nigerian citizens who allegedly
enriched themselves through corruption. The Nigerian EFCC also reportedly secured
convictions of no less than 703 allegedly corrupt persons and the forfeiture of N147
billion to the State. Similar actions were enforced in Angola and Ethiopia.

543. The Executive Council, in its decision EX.CL/1012(XXXIII) of June 2018, called
upon the Commission to lead in the tax transparency and information exchange agenda
for Africa, and foster stronger collaboration among countries and regions for tackling the
root causes of illicit financial flows (IFFs). As a follow up, the Commission, through the
Department of Economic Affairs, prepared a reference book on Domestic Resource
Mobilization and Fighting Illicit Financial Flows and Corruption that will be launched
soon. This book includes contributions on best practices and experiences of Member
States and international l institutions in order to promote better policies against IFFs and
corruption and by fostering collaboration. It is a first step towards setting up an
experience sharing platform between Member States on IFFs and corruption.

      I.    Human Rights

                 Human rights and transitional justice

544. During the year 2018, the Commission deployed a total of sixty-two (62) human
rights observers as follows: forty-seven (47) in Burundi, three (3) each in the Democratic
Republic of the Congo and the Central African Republic, respectively, five (5) in Mali,
and one (1) each in Somalia and South Sudan, respectively. Human rights observers
help in gathering information on the human rights situations on the ground and
contribute to the development of appropriate actions to address these situations in a
timely manner.

545. The Commission and the European Union held the 14th AU-EU Human Rights
Dialogue in Brussels in October 2018. The dialogue was preceded by the AU-EU civil
society organizations seminar on human rights issues, which brought together experts
from African and European civil society to jointly discuss issues of interest for both
continents.

546. The Commission and the United Nations convened the 1st AU-UN Human Rights
Dialogue in Addis Ababa in April 2018. The dialogue served as a platform for the two
organizations to develop joint approaches to preventing and addressing human rights
abuses and violations.

                                                                      EX.CL/1134(XXXIV)
                                                                                Page 93


547. The Assembly, by its decision Assembly/AU/5 (XIV), mandated the Commission
to “initiate steps to build a permanent memorial for the victims of human rights
violations, including genocide, within the African Union headquarters”. As a follow-up to
this decision, the Commission convened in Debre Zeit, Ethiopia, in August 2018, a
validation workshop on the Execution Plan of the AU Human Rights Memorial Project.
The consultation finalized the design of the project as well as the design of the
Documentation Centre, which will provide the history of past violations and serve as
communication centre for researchers working on human rights. The memorial site is
expected to be erected at the AU headquarters during the course of 2019.

548. The Commission carried out the following activities as part of the implementation
of the 10-Year Action Plan of the Human and People’s Rights Decade on Africa (2017-
2026):

      (ii)   the Continental Civil Society and Media Consultation on the Human and
             Peoples’ Rights Decade and its Action Plan was also held in May 2018, to
             involve CSOs and media in the implementation of the 10-Year Action Plan
             in Africa; and

      (iii) a consultation of the Steering Committee of the Human Rights Decade in
            Africa was held in Arusha in July 2018. The meeting focused on the
            development of a roadmap for the implementation of the 10-Year Action
            Plan.

549. The Commission worked with Member States’ experts to finalize the draft AU
Transitional Justice Policy. The draft was submitted in 2016 for consideration by the
STC on Justice and Legal Affairs. While awaiting its adoption by the Policy Organs, the
Commission convened in Niamey in September 2018, a regional conference on
Impunity, Access to Justice and Human Rights. The meeting addressed issues related to
transitional justice, impunity, justice and human rights within the context of emerging
threats to peace and security in West Africa and the Sahel.

550. The Commission organized in Khartoum in October 2018, the 2nd Continental
Forum on Transitional Justice in Africa, to review the state of transitional justice in
Africa, including the various emerging challenges, opportunities and experiences on the
African continent. The Commission also organised a series of regional workshops with
traditional chiefs and leaders across Africa in order to highlight their role in promoting
access to justice for marginalised communities. Work to develop guidelines to bridge
the gap between formal and traditional justice structures is expected to be completed in
2019.

551. On its part, the Pan African Parliament conducted a training session for its
parliamentarians on transitional justice.

                     African Commission of Human and People’s Rights (ACHPR)

552. During the reporting period, the ACHPR considered twenty (20) communications
or complaints. The ACHPR decided not to be seized of nine (9), issued five (5)
Provisional Measures, declared one (1) admissible and two (2) inadmissible and
decided one (1) on the merits. The ACHPR held an Oral Hearing on one (1)
communication, struck out thirteen (13) for lack of diligent prosecution and deferred
seventeen (17) at various stages. The ACHPR also provided the Secretariat with
guidance on two (2) Communications while reversing its decision to refer two (2) cases
to the African Court. The ACHPR also sent numerous Urgent Appeals to States,
concerning the situation of human rights violations on the continent, which in one
instance led to the release of human rights defenders unlawfully detained.

553. Furthermore, pursuant to Executive Council Decision EX.CL/995(XXXII) on its
43rd Activity Report, the ACPHR held a joint retreat with the Permanent Representatives
Committee in June 2018, to resolve various concerns about the relationships between
the ACHPR, the Policy Organs and State Parties, among others. The retreat and other
similar initiatives helped improve cooperation between the ACHPR and other Organs of
the Union, as evidenced with the publication of the Joint Retreat Outcome document as
Executive Council Decision [EX.CL/Dec.1015 (XXXIII)]. The Decision, inter-alia, noted
the “need for the ACHPR and the State Parties through the PRC, to enhance
confidence, trust and cooperation between the two organs for the benefit of the
continent”.

554. The ACPHR’s promotional activities during the reporting period produced the
following results:

       (i)         Ratification of the Maputo Protocol by the Governments of South Sudan
                   and Ethiopia, which increased the number of State Parties to the Protocol

       (iii)       Gazetting by the Government of the Gambia of the Moratorium on the
                   Death Penalty on 18 February 2018;

       (iv)        Enactment by the Government of Rwanda of a law to protect
                   whistleblowers; and;

       (v)         The commitment by the Government of Sierra-Leone to decriminalize
                   defamation.

555. State Parties increased their level of participation at the ACHPR ordinary
sessions where they provided information on developments in the area of human rights
protection at national level. These sessions also offered State Parties the opportunity to
-----------------------Page 97 End-----------------------

                                                                      EX.CL/1134(XXXIV)
                                                                                Page 95

respond to allegations of human rights violations, including the steps taken if any, to
remedy the alleged violations.

556. The Protocol to the African Charter on the Rights of Older Persons in Africa has
only been ratified by five (5) Member States, namely Benin, the Comoros, Ghana,
Sierra Leone and Zambia. This low ratification and the low level of reporting by State
Parties under Article 26 of the Maputo Protocol and Article 14 of the Kampala
Convention constitute major challenges to the realization of the ideals espoused in the
African Charter. In addition, certain provisions within the domestic laws of several State
Parties are yet to be harmonized with the provisions of the African Charter.

557. Furthermore, refusal by State Parties to comply with provisional measures issued
against them and delays in approving promotional and other ACPHR’s missions within
their territories are a serious hindrance to the effective implementation of the ACHPR’s
mandate. During the reporting period, the ACHPR received no information from State
Parties concerned by its provisional measures regarding the implementation of its
decisions in accordance with Rule 112 of its Rules of Procedures.

558. To address these issues, the Executive Council in its decision EX.CL/Dec.1014
(XXXIII) called on State Parties to sign and ratify the various treaties and protocols of
the ACHPR, and to submit their periodic reports under these instruments, as well as
facilitate the fact-finding missions to investigate all alleged violation of human rights.
Furthermore, the Executive Council has called on all State Parties to comply with
requests for Provisional Measures; implement decisions of the ACHPR in
Communications in which they are parties and inform the ACHPR of the measures
taken to implement those decisions in line with the ACHPR’s Rules of Procedures. The
Commission looks forward to the cooperation of State Parties in fulfilling the requests of
the Executive Council on these challenges in the coming weeks and months.

559. Staffing issues at the ACHPR remain unresolved. Currently, only twenty-three
(23) of the approved regular staff strength of forty-six (46) are on board, resulting in
major performance constraints in key units, sections and the secretariat of the ACHPR.
It is gratifying, however, to note that the Executive Council in its decision,
EX.CL/Dec.1014 (XXXII), requested the Commission to expedite the recruitment for the
various unfilled positions at the ACHPR Secretariat in accordance with its approved
organogram and staffing table.

                African Court on Human and People’s Rights

560. The mission of the African Court on Human and Peoples’ Rights is to “enhance,
through judicial decisions, the protective mandate of the African Commission on Human
and Peoples’ Rights by strengthening the human rights protection system in Africa and
ensuring respect for and compliance with the African Charter and related human rights
instruments”.

561. As at 31 December 2018, the Protocol had been ratified by thirty (30) out of the
fifty-five (55) Member States, namely: Algeria, Benin, Burkina Faso, Burundi,
Cameroon, Chad, Congo, Côte d’Ivoire, Comoros, Gabon, The Gambia, Ghana, Kenya,
-----------------------Page 98 End-----------------------

                                                                         EX.CL/1134(XXXIV)
                                                                                   Page 96

Libya, Lesotho, Malawi, Mali, Mauritania, Mauritius, Mozambique, Niger, Nigeria,
Uganda, Rwanda, Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic, Senegal, South Africa, Tanzania,
Togo and Tunisia.

562. Of the 30 State Parties to the Protocol, only nine (9) have made the declaration
under Article 34(6) of the Protocol, accepting the jurisdiction of the Court to receive
cases from individuals and non-governmental organizations. They are Benin, Burkina
Faso, Côte d’Ivoire, Gambia, Ghana, Malawi, Mali, Tanzania and Tunisia

563. During the year under review, the workload of the African Court continued to
increase. In 2018, the Court received a total of twenty-nine (29) new applications
(cases), held four ordinary sessions and one extraordinary session. It also organized
nineteen (19) public hearing to receive oral arguments from the parties, and delivered
sixteen (16) judgments on the merits as well as issued rulings and orders on a number
of pending cases. The Court has also taken steps to reduce the back-log of
applications before it by installing an electronic case management system which will
ensure expeditious consideration and finalization of cases.

564. This increase in the number of cases received by the Court demonstrates that
more and more Member States, non-governmental organizations and individuals are
gradually becoming aware of the existence and work of the Court.

565. Notwithstanding the above development, the Court continues to face a number of
challenges that continue to deprive it of the ability to ensure continent-wide protection of
human rights and contribute meaningfully to the development of the continent. They
include: (i) the level of ratification of the Protocol establishing the Court considering how
long the Court has been in existence; (ii) the very low number of States that have
deposited the declaration under Article 34(6) of the Protocol allowing individuals and
NGOs direct access to the Court; (iii) Member States’ non-compliance with the Court’s
decisions; and (iv) inadequate human and financial resources.

566. It is important to recall that, by its decisions Assembly/AU/Dec.196(XI) of 2008
and Assembly/AU/Dec.529(XXIII) of 2014, the Assembly adopted the Protocol on the
merger of the Court of Justice with the current human rights court (Sharm-el Sheikh
Protocol) and the Amendments to the Protocol on the Statute of the African Court of
Justice and Human Rights (Malabo Protocol), respectively. Both instruments aim to
strengthen the continental justice system and the fight against international crimes and
impunity on the continent.

567. To date however, only six (6) Member States have ratified the Sharm el Sheikh
Protocol, while the Malabo Protocol has received none. It is therefore imperative that, in
light of the Union’s position on the International Criminal Court, Member States
accelerate the establishment of a credible and trustworthy judicial system to deal with
the human rights and international criminal justice challenges we face on the continent.

                 African Union Commission on International Law

568. The African Union Commission on International Law (AUCIL) was established on
the basis of Article 5(2) of the Constitutive Act as an advisory organ of the Union. It is
composed of eleven (11) nationals of Member States who serve in their personal
-----------------------Page 99 End-----------------------

                                                                        EX.CL/1134(XXXIV)
                                                                                  Page 97

capacity. The AUCIL became operational in 2010 following the adoption of its statute by
the Assembly [Assembly/AU/Dec.209 (XII)] in 2009. The Commission’s Office of the
Legal Counsel serves as the AUCIL Secretariat.

569. During the period under review, the AUCIL undertook various studies through the
appointed Special Rapporteurs. In particular, the study on the AU Model Law for the
Implementation of the African Union Convention for the Protection of, and Assistance to,
Internally Displaced Persons in Africa and the AU Model Law was adopted through
Assembly/AU/Dec. 676 (XXX), making it the first ever AUClL document to be endorsed
by the Member States. In collaboration with United Nations High Commissioner for
Refugees (UNHCR), the AUCIL also published the Model Law for further use by the
Member States during the 2019 celebration of the 50th and 10th anniversary of the
1969 OAU Convention and the Kampala Convention respectively.

570. Other studies that are underway cover various subjects, namely: non-double
taxation; domestication of the African Union Convention on Preventing and Combatting
Corruption; domestication of the Protocol to the African Charter on Human and People’s
Rights on the Right of Women in Africa; jurisprudence of the Regional Economic
Communities; implementation of the African Mining Vision; International Environmental
Law; domestication of the African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child; piracy
and maritime security; fight against terrorism; and comparative constitutional law in
Africa.

571. The AUCIL also conducted its 7th Forum on International Law, under the theme
“The Management of Africa’s Natural Resources”. The AUCIL will publish a compilation
of the contributions to the Forum. The publication of the 3rd and 4th Journal of the
AUCIL is also expected by the end of 2018, thereby fulfilling its mandate to disseminate
international law within and beyond the continent.

572. As the legal Advisory body of the Union, the AUCIL through the General
Rapporteur, Prof. Hajer Gueldich, sits as one of the experts guiding the AU institutional
reform.

573. In preparing its 10th Anniversary and in line with Article 25 of the AUCIL Statute,
which calls upon the body to collaborate with international organisations of similar
interest, the AUCIL has placed its request for a joint session with the United Nations
International Law Commission, so as to create a platform of an inclusive discussion on
subjects of international law. The AUCIL also works closely with the Inter-American
Juridical Committee, United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR),
International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and other international organisations.

      II.   Humanitarian Issues

574. Forced displacement remains a complex challenge for the Union. Africa is home
to over a third of the forcibly displaced persons globally. This translates into 6.3 million
refugees and 14.5 million Internally Displaced Persons. The continent is also host to
509,900 asylum seekers and 712,000 stateless persons.
-----------------------Page 100 End-----------------------

                                                                     EX.CL/1134(XXXIV)
                                                                               Page 98

575. Six years after the establishment of the OAU, African leaders adopted the historic
OAU Convention Governing the Specific Aspects of Refugee Problems in Africa. In
2009, they adopted the landmark African Union Convention for the Protection of, and
Assistance to, Internally Displaced Persons in Africa. More recently in January 2015,
the Assembly adopted the Common African Position on Humanitarian Effectiveness,
which commits the Union to address the root causes of forced displacement in Africa
and explore durable solutions.

576. Significantly, during July 2018 Summit in Nouakchott, the Assembly declared
2019 as “The Year of Refugees, Returnees and Internally Displaced Persons: Towards
Durable Solutions to Forced Displacement in Africa.” This 2019 theme will be officially
launched during the February 2019 Summit. It is worth noting that the year 2019 marks
the 50th anniversary of the 1969 OAU Convention on refugees and the 10 th anniversary
of the 2009 African Union Convention for the Protection and Assistance of Internally
Displaced Persons in Africa – commonly known as the Kampala Convention.

577. Pursuant to the Assembly’s decision, the PRC and the Commission conducted in
November 2018 a joint mission to Western Sahara to launch the African Union
Campaign on Accelerated Reduction on Maternal Mortality in Africa (CARMMA) and
assess the refugee situation in order to demonstrate the Union’s solidarity and the
urgency of finding a speedy resolution of the Western Sahara question.

578. In line with the AU Common Position on Humanitarian Effectiveness and as per
the Assembly’s decision [Assembly/AU/Dec.604 (XXVI)] of January 2016, the
Commission continued to take concrete measures toward the operationalization of the
African Union Humanitarian Agency. As requested by the Assembly, the Commission
initiated a feasibility study to determine the Agency’s legal, structural and financial
implications for the Union. Consultations with Member States and Regional Economic
Communities on the establishment of the Agency were also undertaken. The
conclusions of this process will be presented to the Policy Organs for consideration and
endorsement in the course of 2019.

      III.   Institutions

                 Institutions and leadership

579. The Commission’s interactions with National Human Rights Institutions (NHRIs)
continued during the year 2018. National human rights institutions are the key
instruments for Member States’ implementation of human rights instruments and the
advancement of the Union’s human rights agenda. The following activities took place
during the year, in collaboration with the Nairobi-based Network of African National
Human Rights Institutions:

      (i)    a continental consultation with National Human Rights Institutions on the
             Human and Peoples’ Rights Decade in Africa and its Action Plan, held in
             Nouakchott in April 2018, which set up a continental platform for engaging
             NHRIs for effective promotion and protection of human and peoples’ rights.
-----------------------Page 101 End-----------------------

                                                                      EX.CL/1134(XXXIV)
                                                                                Page 99

      (ii)   the 2nd Policy Forum co-organised by AU Commission and the Network of
             African National Human Rights Institutions (NANHRI) on the State of the
             African Human Rights Institutions was convened in Addis Ababa in
             November 2018. The ultimate goal is to enhance the contribution of
             NANHRI in the promotion and protection of human rights in Africa as a part
             of the implementation of the Human and People’s Rights Decade in Africa
             (2017-2026).

580. The Assembly’s Declaration on the 2016 Theme of the Year [Assembly/AU/Dec
l.1(XXVII) Rev.1] mandated the Commission, in close collaboration with all AU Organs
with a human rights mandate, to establish a Pan African Institute for Human Rights
(PAHRI). This decision was taken pursuant to the letter and spirit of Article 45 of the
African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights.

                 Pan-African Parliament

581. During the year under review, the Pan-African Parliament organized several
activities within its mandate, which helped to strengthen its parliamentary functions.
They included the holding of its statutory and non-statutory meetings, notably two
ordinary sessions in May and October 2018, committees’ sittings in March and August
2018, and the meetings of the Bureau and regional and thematic caucuses. All these
activities were organized under the AU theme of the year 2018 “Winning the Fight
against Corruption: A Sustainable Path to Africa’s Transformation”.

582. During the same period, there was also an increase in the number of signatures
and ratifications of the new PAP Protocol, which had now reached the number of
nineteen (19) signatures and ten (10) ratifications.

583. In the course of its work in the year 2018, the Pan-African Parliament adopted
several resolutions and recommendations whose implementation would strengthen the
Union’s agenda on key issues, including ICT developments, the role of women in
fighting corruption and the rights of older persons.

584. In line with its role as a platform for mainstreaming African voices into the AU’s
policy making processes, the Pan-African Parliament co-organized a workshop on
migration flows in May 2018 on illicit financial flows. Furthermore, civil society
organizations took part in all committees’ sittings as well as during the plenary sessions
in May and October 2018.

585. During the year 2018, the Pan-African Parliament deliberated on various issues
affecting human rights, governance, transitional justice and the rule of law on the
continent. The resolutions, recommendations and declarations adopted at these
sessions will contribute to advancing the Union’s human rights and governance agenda.

586. The Pan-African Parliament also debated on issues of peace, security and
stability and conducted training workshops for parliamentarians to enhance their
capacity to deal with peace and security matters. The training focused particularly on
the regulation and control of the use and circulation of small arms and light weapons
-----------------------Page 102 End-----------------------

                                                                       EX.CL/1134(XXXIV)
                                                                                Page 100

and also on transitional justice.

587. Promoting continental integration lies at the core of the mandate of the PAP. In
furtherance of this objective, the Pan-African Parliament contributed in the discourse on
the nexus between tax policy and tax administration to improve effective revenue
mobilization on the continent. The Pan-African Parliament also sensitized members of
Parliament in countering illegal financial flows by raising their awareness on the
renewed AU Migration Policy Framework and the AU Common Position on Global
Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration.

588. The Pan-African Parliament participated in the 4th African Union Customs
Experts Trade Facilitation Forum, held in Cairo in August 2018, where it advocated for
the ratification, domestication and implementation of the AfCFTA and other relevant AU
treaties.

589. The Pan-African Parliament implemented several activities to strengthen its
institutional management capacity, notably on administrative, human resources,
financial and budgetary matters. It is worth noting, on the financial side, the conclusions
of the external audit of the 2017 financial statements and a positive budget execution,
as well as the budgetary increase secured for the 2019 budget.

590. During the year under review, the Pan-African Parliament made strides in the
pursuance of its mandate. However, this Organ continued to face several challenges
due, among others, to the high turnover of its members, which affects institutional
memory and PAP’s capacity to perform effectively its mandated activities. In 2018,
seventy-seven (77) new members – almost a third of the PAP’s membership – were
sworn. Vacancies in the PAP Secretariat and the freezing of recruitment also caused a
serious burden and a relative staff instability within the PAP Secretariat.

591. Building on its work in 2018, the Pan-African Parliament plans in 2019 to engage
more actively with parliamentarians at the national and REC levels on the need for
Member States to ratify, domesticate and implement all the legal and policy frameworks
on continental free trade and free movement of people, the fight against corruption, the
rights of forced migrants, and the rights of persons with disability.

                 African Peer Review Mechanism

592. As of 31 December 2018, the African Peer Review Mechanism (APRM) had a
membership of 37 Member States. By the end of the year 2018, the APRM had
completed governance reviews of twenty-one (21) Member States, with reviews of the
Sudan (first review) and Uganda (second review) completed at the APR Forum of
Heads of State and Government in January 2018.

593. At its 11th extraordinary Summit in Addis Ababa in November 2018, the Assembly
urged the remaining eighteen (18) AU Member States that are not members of the
APRM to accede to it in order to achieve universality in APRM Member States by 2023.
-----------------------Page 103 End-----------------------

                                                                      EX.CL/1134(XXXIV)
                                                                               Page 101

594. During 2018, the APRM completed review missions to Côte d’Ivoire in July 2018
and Mozambique in November 2018. The next set of Peer Reviews by the APR Forum
of Heads of State and Government will take place on 9 February 2019. It will discuss
the review reports emanating from the review missions to Côte d’Ivoire, Mozambique
and Liberia, which had received a review mission in a prior year.

595. The APRM also published and launched the Djibouti review report on 29 March
2018 at a national event bringing together more than 400 participants at the People’s
Palace in Djibouti City, including the Prime Minister of Djibouti, Mr Abdoulkader
Mohamed Kamil, and the Lead APR Panel Member for Djibouti, Professor Fatima
Karadja.

596. The APRM broke new ground in 2018 by introducing targeted reviews on specific
governance topics. Targeted Review Guidelines were sent to Member States. Senegal
and Djibouti voluntarily agreed to undertake Targeted Reviews in early 2019, on
“Mineral Resources in the Heart of the Structural Transformation of the Senegalese
Economy” and “Decentralization in Djibouti” respectively.

597. The APRM Secretariat is the current chair of the African Governance
Architecture (AGA) Platform, which in March 2018 agreed on a Work Plan and Strategic
Framework that identified collaborative priority activities for 2018. The APRM is the lead
institution for the development of the State of Governance in Africa Report (SoGR). The
report assesses the status of African governance, including progress towards the
attainment of the AU shared values, and will be the basis of future monitoring of
governance trends.

598. The APRM Secretariat hosted the first validation meeting on the draft report in
October 2018. In early January 2019, the draft report will be validated by APRM
structures and the AGA Platform. The report is expected to be presented by President
Idris Déby of Chad, Chairperson of the APR Forum, at the February 2019 Summit.

599. The APRM Country Review Reports of Djibouti, Chad and Senegal were tabled
during the first Ordinary session of the Fifth Pan-African Parliament in October 2018.
Concurrently, these reports were tabled at the 63rd Ordinary Session of the African
Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights by the Chairperson of the APRM Panel of
Eminent Persons, Honourable Brigitte Mabandla.

600. From 13 to 14 March 2018, the APRM held its annual flagship meeting, the 2nd
APRM Annual Methodology Forum. The event was attended by members of the APRM
community, experts, collaborating stakeholders and selected government official and
non-state representatives. The Forum exchanged ideas and practices on APRM
Methodology and related processes for improved mission delivery. Discussion centred
on rationalising and improving the APRM approaches in measuring governance,
especially the tools and processes used in the context of the expanded mandate as well
as how to better incorporate APRM reviews in the AGA and APSA frameworks.
-----------------------Page 104 End-----------------------

                                                                     EX.CL/1134(XXXIV)
                                                                              Page 102

601. In 2018, the APRM commenced a project to deepen its reviews, including the
country self-assessment and external review processes by which the final APRM review
report and national programme of action are produced. The outputs from the exercise
are due by December 2019 and will include a revised self-assessment questionnaire; a
revised APRM Organisations & Processes document; revised Guidelines for Countries
to prepare for and Participate in the APRM, and an APRM handbook. The APRM has
also commenced engagements with academic institutions in order to build the African
governance and APRM knowledge base and enrich continental research capabilities in
governance.

602. The Africa Network on Corporate Governance of State-Owned Enterprises was
officially launched in Mauritius in November 2018. The Network which was founded and
managed by the OECD for the benefit of SADC countries, is now launched under the
leadership of the APRM for all regions in Africa. The APRM will align the Network's
priorities with the APRM objective of promoting good corporate governance on the
Continent. The launch was attended by representatives from eighteen (18) Member
States, including Angola, Botswana, Chad, Congo Brazzaville, Congo DRC, Kenya,
Lesotho, Mauritania, Mauritius, Namibia, Niger, Senegal, Seychelles, South Africa,
Sudan, Eswatini, Zambia and Zimbabwe as well as a non-Member State, Turkey.
Furthermore, development financial institutions that support State-Owned Enterprises
were represented, including the Development Bank of Southern Africa (DBSA), Afrexim
Bank and the World Bank. APRM strategic partners, the African Capacity Building
Foundation (ACBF) and the Mo-Ibrahim Foundation also participated in the launch
meeting, as well as the OECD.

603. The APRM Secretariat will continue with the implementation of its work plan in
2019, despite a challenging funding environment due to a shortfall in contributions from
Member States. The Assembly’s decision to integrate the APRM budget in the Union’s
statutory budget will allow APRM to continue to meet its Agenda 2063 obligations as a
part of the AU family.

604. Lastly, the APR Forum that was scheduled to take place in the margins of the
Nouakchott Summit in July 2018 was postponed to the February 2019 Summit because
of the Assembly’s loaded agenda.

J.    CONSOLIDATING PEACE AND SECURITY

605. The Commission organized the third Interfaith Dialogue Forum during the Peace
Month in N’Djamena in November 2018 under the theme of “Faith in Action’: the role of
Religious Leaders in Advancing Peace, Inclusiveness and Development in African
Communities”. The meeting raised awareness on AU instruments on youth, peace and
security, as well as the need for their rapid implementation by Member States facing
armed threats or actively working to prevent conflicts. The third Interfaith Dialogue
Forum also elected a new steering committee to carry out concrete communication
mechanisms between religious leaders through interfaith councils, the AU and Member
States.
-----------------------Page 105 End-----------------------

                                                                      EX.CL/1134(XXXIV)
                                                                               Page 103

606. The Commission’s Directorate of Citizens and Diaspora Organizations (CIDO)
and the German GIZ agency jointly launched the Interfaith Dialogue on Violent
Extremism (iDoVE) pilot project in 2017 which is an intercontinental, innovative youth-
led approaches to highlight the soft power of religion in Preventing Violent Extremism
(PVE). iDove explicitly focuses on youth, as it is the largest group directly affected by
violent extremism. It builds on existing youth initiatives and supports young people’s
engagement and initiatives in developing non-violent approaches to problem solving
and social cohesion.

607. In 2018, the iDove project conducted the iDove Training of Trainers workshop,
developed a detailed manual and further teaching materials on the use of soft power in
preventing violent extremism. Furthermore, the second Intercontinental Youth Forum
under the project was launched at the Commission’s headquarters in Addis Ababa in
October 2018.

608. The Commission’s Directorate of Medical and Health Services worked closely
with the Department of Peace and Security to improve disability and death assessment
for AU peacekeepers in AMISOM and MISCA. Following the adoption by the AU
Medical Board for Death and Disability of the standards operating procedure addendum
in September 2018, the AU Medical Services in collaboration with AMISOM troop
contributing countries, managed in 2017 to clear 95% of the backlog cases from 2007 to
2014. Payments of compensation for the dead cases and wounded peacekeepers with
disability commenced in 2018.

609. In collaboration with the Department of Peace and Security, the Commission’s
Directorate of Medical and Health Services completed the development of medical
equipment specifications for the Level II hospital in Gao, Mali. The equipment was
delivered after requests for proposals were sent to bidders and subsequent technical
and financial evaluation done.

610. On the situation in Burundi, the Commissioner for Peace and Security,
accompanied by former Central African Transition President Mrs. Catherine Samba-
Panza, as Co-Chair of FemWise, met with high level officials in Burundi in November
2018 to express the AU’s solidarity to the Government of Burundi and its support in the
search of sustainable peace. Furthermore, the Commission decided in August 2018 to
maintain the deployment of ten (10) AU Human Right Observers and three (3) Military
Experts to Burundi after the end of the first phase of their mission on 31 August 2018, to
enable the AU to continue monitoring and reporting on the political and security situation
in the country.

611. On the situation in Darfur, the African Union and the United Nations co-hosted a
High Level event in New York in September 2018, on the transition from peacekeeping
to peacebuilding and development in Darfur.

612. The Chairperson of the Commission met in Bangui in September 2018 with
President Faustin-Archange Touadera. They underlined the need for ownership by the
people of Central African Republic of the African Initiative for Peace and Reconciliation.
A delegation of the Commission also visited Bangui in October 2018 to assess the
implementation of the AU Gender Peace and Security Programme.

613. Regarding the situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the Commissioner
for Peace and Security and Mrs. Catherine Samba-Panza traveled to Kinshasa in
November 2018, with a view to supporting the ongoing electoral process and the fight
against Ebola in the Northern Kivu province. Presidential, national and provincial
legislative elections took place on 30 December 2018 in a relatively peaceful
atmosphere.

614. Concerning the situation in the Sudan, the AU High-level Implementation Panel
for Sudan and South Sudan (AUHIP) convened meetings in Addis Ababa, Khartoum
and Johannesburg in October and November 2018, respectively, with the SPLM North
(SPLM-N) and the Government of Sudan on the basis of the Roadmap Agreement,
which stipulates that the parties will urgently resume their negotiations to conclude a
Cessation of Hostilities (CoH) leading to a Permanent Ceasefire (PC) Agreement with
respect to the Two Areas. In the negotiations conducted with the Government of Sudan,
the SPLM-N agreed to further consult with its membership and subsequently reconvene
only with the AUHIP, in order to prepare for a structured engagement with the
Government at a later stage.

615. On the situation in South Sudan, the Commission undertook a consultative
mission to Juba in November 2018, to ascertain with the authorities how the
Commission could contribute in the country’s post-conflict reconstruction phase and the
effective implementation of the Revitalized Agreement for the resolution of the crisis in
South Sudan.

616. It should be recalled that several consultations were held between the AU and
IGAD during the negotiations of the Revitalized Agreement on the Resolution of Conflict
in South Sudan. These consultations, including by the AUHIP, continued after the
signing of the Agreement with a view to supporting its peaceful implementation. The
Commission was represented by Commissioner Smail Chergui in the signing ceremony
that took place in Addis Ababa on 12 September 2018.

617. Concerning the situation in Somalia, the combined efforts of AMISOM and
Somalia National Security Forces has degraded Al Shabaab’s fighting capabilities.
There is need for streamlined and coordinated capacity building for the Somalia
National Security Forces, particularly the training support provided to the Army, with
clear distribution of roles and responsibilities among stakeholders, including AMISOM.
On its part, an evaluation conducted by the Commission’s Department of Peace and
Security in June 2018 on post-conflict reconstruction and development found that quick-
impact projects (QIPs) played a critical role in generating local support within the
context of AMISOM’s mandate implementation and the Somalia Transition Plan.

618. Following a request by the Government of The Gambia and as directed by the
Peace and Security Council on 15 June 2017, the Commission deployed a Technical
Support Team to the Gambia to support the country’s security sector reform (SSR) and
transitional justice processes. The Chairperson of the Commission also visited Banjul in
October 2018, to demonstrate the AU’s political support to The Gambia’s democratic
transition and institutional reforms.

                                                                     EX.CL/1134(XXXIV)
                                                                              Page 105


619. The Commission’s Department of Peace and Security published three key policy
documents in November 2018, on “Results-Based Framework for PCRD Activities”,
“Guidelines Note for the Implementation of the African Union Post-Conflict
Reconstruction and Development Policy”, and “Policy Brief on African Union’s Quick
Impact Project Implementation: Lessons Learned from Somalia”. They cover the
planning, coordination, implementation, monitoring, and evaluation phases of post-
conflict reconstruction and development interventions in Africa and will help facilitate
strategic interventions in this area.

620. Following the adoption in August 2018 by the Council of Ministers of the Lake
Chad Basin Commission (LCBC) of the Regional Strategy for Stabilization, Recovery
and Resilience of the areas affected by Boko Haram in the Lake Chad Basin, the
Commission’s Interdepartmental Task Force met with the Lake Chad Basin Countries
and the Multi-National Joint Task Force in Ndjamena in November 2018 to deliberate on
the way forward for operationalising key institutions envisaged in the Strategy. The
Strategy will be submitted to the PSC for its consideration during the course of
December 2018.

621. The Commission conducted a Bilateral Technical Desk Review with the United
Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights in September 2018 to refine
the existing human rights indicators in the Continental Early Warning System (AU-
CEWS) and strengthen the overall integration of a human rights-based approach to
conflict prevention data.

622. In cognizance of the increased number of farmer-pastoralist conflicts on the
continent and its growing threats and linkages to other transnational organized crimes,
the Commission organized a meeting on “Farmer-Herders Conflict in Africa: Towards a
Continental Conflict Transformation Mechanism” in September 2018, to develop a
sustainable policy alongside action-oriented strategies to transform them holistically.

623. The AU Border Programme conducted an assessment mission in Mozambique in
June 2018, Namibia in August 2018, Zimbabwe in September 2018, and Zambia in
October 2018, in order to determine the human and institutional capabilities of these
Member States to delimit, demarcate, and reaffirm their common international
boundaries. In addition, the Commission facilitated meetings of the Joint Demarcation
Committee of South Sudan and Sudan in August 2018, the Joint Technical Committee
of the Riparian States of Lake Tanganyika in September 2018, and the Joint
Demarcation Committee of South Sudan and Sudan. The purpose of the meetings were
to assess the progress made by Member States involved in these initiatives and
address any challenges in the delimitation/demarcation of their common boundaries.

624. On cross-border cooperation, the AU Border Program undertook advocacy
efforts for the signing and ratification of the African Convention on Cross-Border
Cooperation (Niamey Convention), adopted by the Assembly in June 2014
[Assembly/AU/Dec.529(XXIII)]. In this regard, the Commission provided assistance in
the establishment of local cross-border committees between Malawi and Tanzania in
August 2018. The Commission also organized the 4th AU Border Programme with the

                                                                      EX.CL/1134(XXXIV)
                                                                               Page 106

RECs/RMs Coordination Meeting in Arusha, following which the 2018-2022 AUBP-
RECs/RMs Roadmap and the proposed Terms of Reference for the RECs/RMs Border
Focal Points were adopted, and best practices on border management were shared.

625. During the reporting period, in line with the decisions of the Policy Organs, the
Commission pursued its efforts towards the full operationalization of the African Standby
Force (ASF) and its Rapid Deployment Capability (RDC). Within the process of
implementing the Maputo 5 Year Work Plan on the enhancement of the ASF, the
African Capacity for Immediate Response to Crises (ACIRC) Volunteer Nations (VNs) a
Command Post Exercise (CPX) code named UTILIVU AFRICA IV (UA IV) 2018, was
conducted in Jinja, Uganda from 26 August to 4 September 2018.

626. In the implementation of the Assembly’s decision Assembly/AU/Dec.679 (XXX)
on harmonisation of ACIRC activities with ASF Framework, the Commission’s
Department of Peace and Security facilitated the meeting of the PSC Military Staff
Committee which was assigned to develop a roadmap on harmonization of the ACIRC
within the ASF framework. The recommendations will be considered by the PSC in
December 2018 for onward submission to the Assembly at its next session in February
2019.

627. As part of the Monitoring and Evaluation of Implementation, the Commission held
the 10th Training Implementation Workshop in October 2018 to review progress in the
implementation of the Training Directives. One of the key identified challenges was the
lack of funding for ASF training priorities as highlighted in the Directive. The AUC and
RECs/RMs continue relying on partner funding, but these are not always aligned with
the priorities highlighted in the Directive.

628. The Specialized Technical Committee on Defense, Safety and Security
(STCDSS) met in Addis Ababa in October 2018 to consider two policies, namely
“Conduct and Discipline” and “Prevention and Response to Sexual Exploitation and
Abuse”. As a follow-up to the STDSS’ request to the PSC to adopt these policies, the
Commission transmitted them to Member States in November 2018 for their inputs and
response to the PSC. Subsequently, the PSC adopted the two policy documents on 29
November 2018.

629. During the period under review, the operations conducted by the Multinational
Joint Task Force (MNJTF) in the Lake Chad islands resulted in the degradation of Boko
Haram capabilities and the rescue of more than 21,000 abducted civilians, thus
increasing the security of the affected population. In accordance with the Memorandum
of Understanding (MoU) and Support Implementation Agreement (SIA) between the AU,
the LCBC and MNJTF Troop Contributing Countries, the Commission provided
additional support to the MNJTF and funding for QIPs using its own resources.

630. In line with the AU Policy Framework on Security Sector Reform (SSR), the
Commission provided technical support to the Government of Madagascar in November
2018 with the operationalization of the national SSR framework. Technical expertise
was also offered to Mali in November 2018, to support the development of the national
strategic vision towards the implementation of DDR/SSR in line with the principles of the

                                                                        EX.CL/1134(XXXIV)
                                                                                 Page 107

Peace Accord. Furthermore, a training workshop for Member States was held in Addis
Ababa in September 2018, on the development of national codes of conduct for security
institutions to enhance their efficiency and professionalism.

631. The Department of Peace and Security organized the 2nd Africa Forum on SSR in
October 2018 to exchange views on the challenges and opportunities of sustainable
SSR initiatives in Africa. The Department also launched Phase II of the project on
“Engaging Civil Society in Security and Justice Sector Reforms” with two capacity
building workshops for civil society groups held in July and December 2018,
respectively.

632. In strengthening national and regional capacities on Disarmament,
Demobilization and Reintegration (DDR), and within the framework of the Lake Chad
Basin Stabilization Strategy, the Commission’s Department of Peace and Security
convened regional and national consultations that resulted in the adoption of a
comprehensive framework on screening, prosecution, rehabilitation and reintegration of
persons associated with Boko Haram.

633. On its part, the Government of Somalia received assistance in developing an
integrated database to facilitate storing, retrieval and analysis of all information related
to the national defector rehabilitation program. The Commission further assisted the
Government of Somalia in reviewing its national defector rehabilitation program to
identify current gaps and challenges of the screening, amnesty policy and reintegration
processes, as well as the required improvements to strengthen the program.

634. Furthermore, and in order to assist Member States in dealing with the challenges
posed by temporary conflicts and the challenges to traditional approaches, the
Department developed Operational Guidance Notes on Foreign Fighters and
Countering Violent Extremism in DDR contexts. Both notes were validated by Member
States, regional and international experts in July 2018 and were readied for wider
dissemination at the time of this reporting.

635. Within the context of the month of September as the Africa Amnesty Month, the
Commission assisted Member States in designing and implementing national initiatives
to promote voluntary disarmament and combat illicit arms flows. The Commission also
increased the support provided to Member States in line with the Ammunition Safety
Management Initiative. In Malawi, the Commission’s Department of Peace and Security
undertook a technical assessment mission in March 2018 to help identify the gaps and
needs ammunition management followed by a technical training on ammunition
management in June 2018. The draft AU Policy for the Management of Recovered
Arms and Ammunition in PSOs was validated by Member States, regional and
international experts in November 2018. It is expected to be endorsed by the STC-DSS
in 2019.

636. In the area of disarmament and non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction
(WMD), the Commission provided technical and financial support for the convening of
the 4th Ordinary Session of the Conference of States Parties to the Treaty of Pelindaba,
in March in Addis Ababa, as well as the 1st and 2nd Extraordinary Sessions, in Addis
-----------------------Page 110 End-----------------------

                                                                      EX.CL/1134(XXXIV)
                                                                               Page 108

Ababa in June and November 2018, respectively. The Commission also supported the
convening of the 9th Ordinary Session of the African Commission on Nuclear Energy
(AFCONE) in October 2018 in Addis Ababa. In August 2018, the Commission organized
a training course for National Points of Contact on UN Security Council resolution 1540
(2004). At the request of Member States, the Commission’s Department of Peace and
Security commenced the development of a Comprehensive WMD Model law, with an
inception experts meeting that was held in December 2018 to decide on its scope and
structure.

637. Overall, there is need for increased political will and cooperation on the part of
Member States in the area of conflict prevention, predictable funding, reliable provision
of logistics and deployment of the necessary human resources, as well as better
coordination between the PSC and the RECs/RMs policy organs dealing with peace
and security.

K.    ENHANCING AFRICA’S ROLE AND POSITION IN AFRICA AND GLOBALLY

      I.    Engaging Civil Society and the Diaspora

                ECOSOCC

638. ECOSOCC continued its reform and relocation efforts. Activities during the year
2018 covered the operationalization of ECOSOCC thematic clusters, the relocation of
the Secretariat with the recruitment of a dedicated staffing structure, and the expansion
of the national chapters in all Member States.

639. ECOSOCC convened in Nairobi in March 2018 the 8th ordinary session of the
Standing Committee of the 2nd ECOSOCC Permanent General Assembly. Discussions
centered around the election of the ECOSOCC 3rd Permanent General Assembly, which
was scheduled to take place in Nairobi in December 2018. In preparation for this
election, the Credentials Committee met three times: first in Cairo in April and October
2018, followed by Casablanca in September 2018, and Addis Ababa in November 2018.

640. Progress was made on the relocation of the ECOSOCC Secretariat to Lusaka.
The Commission and the Government of Zambia signed the host agreement during the
July 2018 Summit in Mauritania. Eleven (11) priority positions were advertised and
recruitment is ongoing for the effective operationalization of the Secretariat in Zambia;

641. ECOSOCC and the AU Advisory Board on Corruption convened a joint Sectorial
Cluster Planning meeting in Nairobi in February 2018. They discussed a mechanism for
tackling corruption and established a collaborative strategy with an emphasis on the role
of CSOs at Member States level to facilitate dialogue and synergy in this area.

642. Fifteen (15) ECOSOCC National Chapters were launched in line with the relevant
Executive Council decisions [EX.CL./Dec.869 (XXVI) of January 2015 and
EX.CL./Dec.924(XXVI) of June 2015], which consider national chapters as a framework
for accountability of elected members, as well as a conduit for disseminating information
and mobilizing support for AU programs and activities. The low number of national

                                                                      EX.CL/1134(XXXIV)
                                                                               Page 109

chapters is due to the lack of a special budget allocation to support their activation and
coordinate their work.

643. ECOSOCC organized two side events during the High-level Political Forum on
Sustainable Development, which was held in New York in July 2018. The first one,
entitled ‘The Blue and Green Economy Nexus in Africa’, was held jointly with the
Commission’s CIDO Division, and the other, entitled ‘Creating a Green Economy in
Africa: Lessons and Opportunities for the Future’, was co-hosted with the Government
of Zambia. Critical issues were raised on the role of CSOs in influencing policy
decisions.

644. During the period under review, ECOSOCC submitted an advisory opinion on
two critical issues affecting the continent, namely migration focusing on Libya’s stranded
migrants, and the enhancement of peace and security in Africa.

645. The first phase of the implementation of the Executive Council’s decision on
ECOSOCC’s reform was completed with the convening of a multi-stakeholder
consultation to develop the framework and provide inputs for the second and final
phase. This process was expected to be finalized in the last quarter of 2018.

646. Member States’ increased support to ECOSOCC, particularly the approval and
release of its operational and relocation budgets, is welcomed. However, this Organ
encounters several challenges, including limited representation of civil society
organizations from Member States, the lack of standardized framework for the
development and submission of advisory opinions – a key function of this Organ – and
limited participation of women in ECOSOCC structures.

                Diaspora Volunteer Corps and Diaspora Investment Fund
                 Projects

647. Work began on two diaspora legacy projects, namely the Diaspora Volunteer
Corps and the African Diaspora Investment Fund. A pilot phase for the African Diaspora
Volunteer Corps was rolled out in the last quarter of 2018. A feasibility study of the
African Diaspora Investment Fund is underway. It includes an analysis of existing and
planned diaspora and investment funds and schemes promoted and managed by the
African Development Bank, Member States, Diaspora organizations and other relevant
bodies in Africa.

                African Diaspora Global Market Place Project

648. This project was a proposal by the World Bank in early 2010. It was included in
the Commission’s Diaspora Legacy projects in 2012. However, since then, no activity
was undertaken for its implementation due to lack of budget. Plans are underway to
revive it in 2019 and carry it out alongside the other Diaspora Legacy projects.
-----------------------Page 112 End-----------------------

                                                                        EX.CL/1134(XXXIV)
                                                                                 Page 110

                 Diaspora engagement in Union’s activities

649. The Declaration of the Global Diaspora Summit, held in Johannesburg in May
2012, recognized the need to build sustainable partnerships between Africa and the
governments and peoples of African descent in different regions of the world. In
recognition of the importance of engaging the global African community, the Assembly
subsequently designated the African Diaspora as the Sixth (6th) Region of the continent.

650. The Commission and other stakeholders on the continent and in the African
Diaspora have taken several initiatives to implement this decision in line with Article 3(q)
of the Protocol on Amendments to the Constitutive Act of the African Union
[Assembly/AU/Dec.26(II)] of July 2003,          which “invites the African Diaspora to
participate as an important part of the building and development of the Union”.

651. It should be noted that the Protocol on Amendments to the Constitutive Act
[Doc.Assembly/AU/8(II) Add.10) has yet to enter into force because it has not received
the number of required ratifications. Nevertheless, the Commission has drafted a legal
framework for the participation of the Diaspora in the AU, in accordance with decisions
EX.CL.Dec.406(XII) of January 2008, and Assembly/AU/Dec.443(XIX) of July 2012.

652. The legal framework was presented to Member States’ focal points in December
2018, for a technical review. The draft legal framework will be submitted to the
Permanent Representatives Committee during the course of the year 2019.

653. The first ever African Diaspora Young Leaders was held in Washington, DC, in
August 2018, under the theme “Connecting Leaders across Africa and the Diaspora”.
The forum was organized by the AU Washington DC Office in collaboration with the US
State Department and two US-based Diaspora organizations, namely the African
Development Foundation and the Constituency for Africa, which works on U.S.- Africa
foreign policy with a particular focus on the African Diaspora. More than three hundred
young men and women from various parts of the continent met with their counterparts
from the Diaspora to tackle such issues as the negative image of Africa in US media,
relations between people of Africans on the continent and in the Diaspora, and the role
that sports and technology can play in driving growth, peace and unity.

654. The AU’s drive for literacy development in Africa secured the support of Books
for Africa, a US-based non-profit organization which is the largest distributor and donor
of books to the continent. Books for Africa undertook to supply to the Commission
22,000 books on law, human rights, international relations, science, law, health and
other subjects, to coincide with the February 2019 Summit.

655. In its efforts to mobilize and organize the Diaspora in the US, the AU Washington
DC Office established AU’s Diaspora Chapters in Washington, DC, Maryland and
Virginia (DMV Region), North Carolina and South Carolina (The Carolinas),
Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Delaware, (The Tri-States), and California. Within each
AU Chapter, the Diaspora is organized into Pan African Diaspora Women Association
(PADWA), Pan African Youth Association (PADYA) and Pan African Diaspora Men
Association (PADMA). The work is underway to cover the entire USA, in Canada, South

                                                                               Page 111

America, Central America and the Caribbean. The next step will be the implementation
of programs decided by AU Chapters, for the development of Africa, based on the AU
Agenda 2063.

656. Invest in Africa Magazine, the flagship publication of the AU Washington DC
Office, will be produced twice a year (January and June-July), starting from 2019. Since
the magazine’s launch in May 2018, thousands of copies have been distributed online
and in hard copy. The Magazine showcases the best of the continent in terms of
agriculture, infrastructure, commerce, tourism and trade. It offers corporates,
government institutions and businesses the opportunity to invest in various sectors in
Africa.

657. AU Diaspora Radio and Podcast: the AU Diaspora radio was launched in
October 2017 by the AU Mission in Washington, DC, and redesigned to reach a wider
audience. It transmits programmes via internet on the AU website and targets a
listenership of about 10,000 at any given time. Eleven (11) volunteer producers host
various shows on pan-African issues, ranging from social economic issues, US policy
on Africa, trade and investment, to health, children’s stories and traditional folklore.
Listeners can tune to <https://steams.radio.co/s614501e52/listen> via the AU Mission’s
website <https://wwwauwashingtondc.org>. Furthermore, the Commission’s CIDO
launched the AU on the Go Podcast on Africa Day. Just like the AU radio, the podcast
aims to strengthen a positive image of Africa among African citizens in and outside the
continent, and the international community at large, with a specific focus on youth. To
date, the podcast has launched five episodes in which it seeks to explain various topics
related to the Union’s work. The podcast is available on Android, iTunes, and
Soundcloud.

                African Diaspora Mapping

658. In recognition of the fact that diaspora communities are dynamic and often
fragmented and divided, the Commission through CIDO has integrated diaspora
mapping as an integral feature in its work. In addition to engagement with the African
Diaspora through regional consultative conferences, a mapping exercise is usually
conducted prior to visiting a non-African country. This exercise helps ascertain pertinent
facts about the African diaspora members in that particular country and understand the
circumstances that led to their migration. During 2018, mapping was conducted in five
countries in Western Europe (Belgium, France, Germany, Netherlands, and UK),
Australia, China, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar.

      II.   Enhancing positive image through economic self-reliance and culture

                Encyclopaedia Africana project

659. The second Technical Workshop on the implementation of the Encyclopaedia
Africana Project was held in Accra in 2016 and 2017 in accordance with the objectives
set forth in the First 10-Year Implementation Plan of Agenda 2063. Key outcomes of the
workshop included a roadmap for project financing, the reconstitution of the Scientific

Committee to produce the scholarly content for the Encyclopaedia, the role of the
Commission in the project implementation, and the structure and content of the next
edition of the Encyclopaedia.

660. The third technical workshop took place in Freetown in June 2018. It focused on
the establishment of the International Scientific Committee to develop the framework for
the next edition of the Encyclopaedia Africana. The framework outlines the working
methodology of the scientific committee to kick start the process for the next edition of

                Charter on African Culture Renaissance

661. The Commission continued its advocacy and sensitization campaign for the
ratification of the Charter for African Cultural Renaissance. The Charter was adopted by
the Assembly in 2006, but it has yet to enter into force because only twelve (12)
Member States have ratified it. Working with the Champions of the Charter – that is, the
twelve countries that ratified it, namely Angola, Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Chad,
The Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal and South Africa – the
Commission developed a draft Implementation Guide of the Charter to assist Member
States in the implementation process.

662. The 4th Ordinary Session of the Specialized Technical Committee on Justice and
Legal Affairs, held in November 2018 adopted the amendment of article 35 of the
Charter for African Cultural Renaissance on entry into force. The objective is for the
Charter to enter into force thirty days after the receipt by the Commission of the
fifteenth instrument of ratification.

663. The African Audio-Visual and Cinema Commission was established in July 2016
as an AU Specialized Agency by the Executive Council’s decision EX.CL./Dec.
921(XXIX). Its draft statute was adopted in 2017 by the STC on Youth, Culture and
Sport, and endorsed by the STC on Justice and Legal Affairs in Addis Ababa in
November 2018. The establishment of the Commission’s temporary secretariat in
Kenya is under way; it will be launched in early 2019.

664. The Commission has finalized the draft AU Model Law on the Protection of
Cultural Property and Heritage. The draft was adopted by the STC on Youth, Culture
and Sport in Algiers in October 2018. The model law will assist Member States in
enacting their own legislation on cultural property and heritage and in their fight against
illicit trafficking in cultural goods.

665. In its decision EX.CL./Dec.1006(XXXII) of January 2018, the Executive Council
requested “the Commission and Member States to develop programmes to promote a
culture of reading among children, youth and adults, as well as the promotion of African
writers and African content in education curricula, in line with the Continent Education
Strategy for Africa, adopted by the Assembly in January 2016”. As a follow-up, the
Commission initiated the development of a continental programme on the promotion of
reading to empower young generations of Africans to learn from and renew the spirit of
Pan-Africanism. The launch of the programme across the continent is planned for 2020.

                                                                                Page 113


                African Languages

666. The Secretariat of the African Academy of Languages (ACALAN), in 2018,
continued to implement its core projects, including the harmonisation of the writing
system of African languages, terminology development, the implementation of the
ECOWAS chapter (including the Islamic Republic of Mauritania) of the Linguistic Atlas
of Africa, the development of the Kiswahili corpus as a component of the African
Languages, and the cyberspace project and the promotion of Kiswahili as a language of
wider communication.

667. ACALAN also launched the Pan-African School of Translation and Interpretation,
whose aim is to train Africans to translate from one African or former colonial language
to another. The Academy also advocated the development of language policies in
Member States within the context of the Language Plan of Action for Africa (LPAA). It
encouraged the publication in African languages by instituting and allocating prizes and
awards to organisations and persons contributing to the promotion of African languages.

668. Within the period covered by this report, ACALAN carried out visibility and
advocacy campaigns in the Member States to publicize its activities and programmes
and create more synergies and partnerships and support.

669. In 2018, ACALAN established Vehicular Cross-border Language Commissions
(VCLC) for five (5) African languages, of which three were in West Africa – Ewe,
Soninke and Songhay ; and two for the vehicular (mega) languages in Central African
Republic (Sango) and IsiZulu (South Africa), respectively. ACALAN also harmonised the
writing systems of eight (8) Vehicular Cross-border Languages, namely, Beti-
fang, Kikongo, Kinyarwanda/Kirundi, Kiswahili, Lingala, Luganda, Malagasy, Somali.

670. The Specialised Technical Committee on Youth, Culture and Sports (STC-YCS–
3), meeting in Algiers in October 2018, adopted the week from 24 to 30 January as
the African Languages Week, to mark, among others, the important role of African
languages in African integration and development. Reflections and advocacies will be
conducted to sensitise the African population about the importance of African languages
for a peaceful, prosperous and integrated Africa.

671. ACALAN’s perspectives for 2019 include the continued collaboration with
Member States on the development of national language policies which will lead to a
continental language policy within the context of the Language Plan of Action for Africa.
ACALAN will also continue the harmonization of the writing systems of vehicular cross-
border languages and enable them assume their role as languages of integration.
Implementation of the linguistic atlas of Africa will continue as a priority project, and
efforts will be intensified to modernise African linguistic tools, making it possible to
effectively bridge the digital divide. ACALAN also intends to institute and award prizes to
organisations and individuals contributing to the promotion of African languages to
encourage publications in African languages.

                                                                              Page 114

                 Safeguarding and promotion of Africa and its Diaspora oral
                  traditions and history

672. For centuries, the people of African descent have faced unprecedented levels of
injustice, deprivation and discrimination in different parts of the world. The Durban
Declaration of Programme of Action (DDPA) of 2001 provided the framework to combat
racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, and affirmed that
people of African descent were victims of enslavement and have been suffering from its
consequences.

673. In 2013, the UN General Assembly adopted Resolution 68/237 that proclaimed
the International Decade for People of African Descent: recognition, justice and
development. The Decade ran from 1 January 2015 and will end on 31 December 2024.
It aims to promote respect, recognition and realization of all human rights and
fundamental freedoms for the people of African descent.

674. The Commission, in coordination with the UN Office of the High Commissioner
for Human Rights, organized a symposium on the implementation of the International
Decade for People of African Descent resolution in Accra in September 2018. The event
constituted the first AU major event to commemorate the Decade and elaborate a
continental platform for the achievement of the Decades’ Program of Action with respect
to the three main pillars of recognition, justice and development.

675. The symposium raised awareness among Member States and the RECs about
the Decade, consolidated multiple goals set forth by the International Decade for People
of African Descent and related frameworks, and developed actionable measures within
the context of the Program of Activities of the Decade, in accordance with the Durban
Declaration and Program of Action (DDPA) and the International Convention on the
Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (ICEARD).

676. During the year under review, the Commission, through CIDO, initiated an
outreach project to the African community in China as part of the African Diaspora. The
African community in China is not only the largest but the youngest in Asia, comprising
African business people and traders (about 61%) and students (23%), the majority of
whom are between 25 and 34 years old and holders of tertiary degrees.

677. The Commission, in collaboration with the Government of China, initiated
activities to project the AU vision in China and improve Africa’s outreach. They include
increased contacts with the African diplomatic corps and the African diaspora network in
China and strengthening cultural and people-to-people exchanges between China and
Africa, through the newly opened AU Representational Office in Beijing.

      III.   Africa’s Role in Global and Regional Institutions

                 Coordinating Africa’s global engagement on trade

678. The Commission, in liaison with the UN-ECA and the AU Representational
Mission in the United States (Washington DC Office) co-organized a workshop to assist
-----------------------Page 117 End-----------------------

                                                                     EX.CL/1134(XXXIV)
                                                                              Page 115

eligible Member States in developing their AGOA utilization strategies. The Commission
also took part in the convening of the 2018 AGOA Midterm Review which evaluated
AGOA utilization by the eligible countries. The Review also prepared recommendations
that were considered during the 2018 AGOA Forum that took place in July 2018. Among
other outcomes, the Forum recommended improvements in the utilization of AGOA
preferences, post-AGOA processes, and recent developments in global trade.

679. Concerning the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development
(UNCTAD), the AU Permanent Delegation in Geneva pursued its support to the African
Group for an effective implementation of the Nairobi "Maafikiano" outcome that will
ensure that Africa draws maximum benefit from the decisions of the said Conference.
The Geneva Office also continued its support to the African Group in the negotiations
on the revitalization of the UNCTAD Intergovernmental Machinery.

680. During the year under review, the AU Permanent Delegation in Geneva
continued its efforts to assist the African Group in Geneva involved in the WTO
processes. An internal retreat for the African Group was held in July 2018 in the
preparation of the post Buenos Aires Ministerial Conference (MC11). In this context, the
Geneva Office organised several meetings at the level of Ambassadors and Experts of
the African Group to prepare the African Common Position at all the levels of the
negotiations.

681. The retreat came up with concrete recommendations to ensure coherence
between the African Group’s negotiating agenda at the WTO and AfCFTA’s priorities.
The retreat also addressed the key policy issues, notably on trade distorting domestic
support including Cotton, the Special Safeguard Mechanism (SSM) and public
stockholding (PSH), and on the G90 Special and Differential Treatment (S&DT)
proposals confronting the African Group in respect to current dynamics in the WTO and
defined a way forward for the African Group on the remaining Doha negotiations issues.
The difficulties in the negotiations have been compounded by the challenges to the
Dispute Settlement Mechanism and growing risks to core principles and disciplines
underpinning the trading system.

L.    SERVICE DELIVERY, PARTNERSHIPS AND OUTREACH

      I.    Service Delivery

                Budget and Financial Matters

682. During the reporting period, the Commission strived to strengthen budget reforms
and financial reporting and effectively implement the oversight mechanism as decided
by the Policy Organs.

683. The Committee of AU Ministers of Finance (F15) increased its oversight role
during the preparation and approval of the 2019 AU budget. With the support of the
PRC Sub-Committees on General Supervision, Budgetary, Financial and Administrative
Matters, and Programs and Conferences, the F15 were able to identify waste and
redundancy in the proposed budget.
-----------------------Page 118 End-----------------------

                                                                        EX.CL/1134(XXXIV)
                                                                                 Page 116


684. Of the nine (9) Golden Rules approved by the Assembly in January 2018, to
underpin the budget reform process, four (4) related to budget preparation were fully
applied to the 2019 budget and led to a reduced budget by 12% compared to 2018, and
a balanced budget for 2019.

685. Budget ceilings introduced in the 2019 budget have been communicated to all
AU units – the Commission and other Organs and Specialized Agencies – and the
gradual process to reduce the ratio of operational budget (including salaries) to the total
budget from the current 48% towards the recommended 30% by 2021 has commenced.

686. Overall, and as a result of the above measures, the 2019 budget has decreased
by 12% compared to 2018, while ensuring that Member States will gradually increase
their assessed contributions. As of July 2018, Member States assessed contributions
stood at a rate of 34%. Meanwhile, dependency on partner financing continues,
especially on some key projects.

687. The Commission also proposed, in June 2018, a reformulated scale of
assessment, based on the principles of equitable burden sharing, the ability to pay,
solidarity, avoidance of risk concentration and the setting up of “caps and minima”.
Representing the Ministerial Committee on the Scale of Assessment, members of the
PRC discussed it in Addis Ababa in June 2018. However, the PRC requested for more
clarifications and agreed to carry out wider consultations at the PRC level before
submitting it for the consideration of the Ministerial Committee in November 2018. The
Assembly’s extraordinary session of November 2018 adopted a decision on the issue.

688. Implementation of the decision of the 2015 Sandton Summit of funding 100% of
operational budget, 75% of the program budget, and 25% of peace support by 2021 is
also moving apace. Twenty-four (24) Member States – Kenya, the Gambia, Congo
Republic, Gabon, Rwanda, Cameroun, Chad, Sierra Leone, Djibouti, Côte d’Ivoire,
Guinea, Benin, Sudan, Ghana, Mauritius, Seychelles, Malawi, Algeria, Nigeria,
Comoros, Mauritania, Ethiopia, Senegal and Libya are at different phases of
domesticating the AU import levy. Among them, fourteen (14), namely: Kenya, Gambia,
Congo Brazzaville, Gabon, Rwanda, Cameroun, Chad, Sierra Leone, Djibouti, Cote
d’Ivoire, Guinea, Benin, Sudan and Ghana currently collect the levy and, with the
exception of Chad and the Gambia, have paid their assessed contributions through the
new system
689. The Commission also endeavoured to submit financial and audit reports to the
Policy Organs as stipulated in the AU Financial Rules and Regulations. As a result,
external audit reports were for the first time submitted for the consideration of the Policy
Organs at the June/July 2018 Summit in Nouakchott.
690. The Commission also embarked in the acquisition and installation of state-of-the-
art equipment for conference management. This includes six I-Mac computers, a
banner making machine, full-colour invitation, flier and card printing, as well as
installation of an infra-red wireless conference system for the Multi-Purpose Hall. The
new equipment shifts the production of conference material in-house and, therefore,
help cut rental and outsourcing cost. It also enhances processing time for design and
layout.
-----------------------Page 119 End-----------------------

                                                                       EX.CL/1134(XXXIV)
                                                                                Page 117


                Staffing Matters

691. The AU’s staffing status exhibits a high and growing pool of short-term
employment at 64%, as opposed to regular staffing (36%). This is mainly the result of
the imbalance between the current implementation of the Maputo Structure, which was
last revised in 2012, and the dynamic mandate of the AU. The Maputo Revised
Structure is now obsolete in that it does not address the need of the new, highly skilled,
technically diversified positions aligned to Agenda 2063. The Commission proposed a
revised structure in 2016, which was conditionally approved by the Policy Organs. It is
now awaiting implementation.

692. Short-term staff are funded through Member States and Partners budget as
follows: 39% short-term staff are paid from the Vacant Posts budget, 29% from
Departmental Programs such as Youth Volunteers or Special Representatives to the
Chairperson of the Commission, while 32% are Project staff paid from partners fund
supporting key program activities such as CDC, CAADP, PAU, and Research Grant.

693. It should be noted that more than two hundred short-term staff have been under
this contract condition for over ten years, which shows that the staffing structure used is
no longer aligned with the Organization’s needs. The majority provide essential general
service support, including security guards, drivers, and administrative assistants.

694. The large number of short-term staff is cause for low staff morale. It leads to high
staff turnover and, therefore, the loss of institutional memory and knowledge.

695. The Commission, through the Administration and Human Resources Directorate,
continued to work towards finding a lasting solution to this staffing issue which was also
on the agenda of the Assembly’s extraordinary session in November 2018.

                Performance Management

696. The AU’s performance management system is another critical issue that requires
greater attention from the AU leadership. Performance management is mandated by the
AU Staff Rules and Regulations for the purpose of aligning systematically the
Organization’s vision with is programs, budget and staff performance. The system was
improved in 2017 to address several issues, including the non-alignment of staff
performance management system with AU objectives, and the underutilization of the
system. The new performance management cycle is in line with budget cycle.

                Official Travel

697. Staff travel is among the Organization’s core activities and a financial cost driver.
Currently, 46% of the Commission’s expenditure goes to official travel which includes
accommodation, air tickets and daily subsistence allowances (DSAs). During the period
under review, the Commission put in place several measures to streamline the travel
process and make it more cost effective. They include a review of the AU Travel Policy
-----------------------Page 120 End-----------------------

                                                                        EX.CL/1134(XXXIV)
                                                                                 Page 118

and the enforcement of measures such as the mandatory submission of a quarterly
mission plan, the limit of all staff travel to a maximum of twenty-one (21) travel days per
quarter per staff member, and the automation of all travel requests.

698. Procurement management is key for the Organization’s successful performance
if it can minimize supply chain costs and risks. However, it should be noted that due to
the location of the AU Headquarters, AMISOM and IBAR Offices in Ethiopia and Kenya,
the share of procurement expenditures was higher in the East – 68.04% - than in other
AU regions. The Commission is taking measures to ensure a balanced share among all
the AU regions.

                 Strengthening accountability within the Commission

699. The African Union Ethics Office was established in August 2016 pursuant to Rule
78 (3) (c) of the AU Staff Regulations and Rules. It covers the administrative activities of
all the Union’s Organs, peacekeeping missions and representational offices.

700. The Office is mandated to implement the African Union Code of Ethics and
Conduct (hereinafter the “Code”) and to cultivate and nurture an ethical culture in the
delivery of the Union’s mandate. The Code mandates the Ethics Office to hold elected
officials and staff members equally accountable for the delivery of their respective roles
and responsibilities and that they perform their functions consistent with the highest
standards of integrity required by the Code and other relevant rules and regulations. To
ensure its independence and autonomy, the Ethics Office reports annually to the PRC
through the Chairperson for the consideration of the Executive Council.

701. Pursuant to its mandate to provide ethics training and create awareness of the
African Union values, the Ethics Office held ethics training sessions for the Commission,
other AU Organs, AU Representational Missions and Technical Agencies.

702. The Ethics Office trained around 2,000 Staff Members and Elected Officials. The
interactive sessions allowed staff members to raise issues, challenges and ethical
dilemmas they encountered in the course of their duties and seek guidance on how to
remain ethically compliant with AU values, regulations and rules.

703. The training on the code of ethics primarily focused on behavioural change and
promoted core AU ethical values, including respect for diversity and teamwork,
transparency and accountability, integrity and impartiality, and efficiency and
professionalism.

704. The training on the code of conduct required elected officials and staff members
to comply in the execution of their responsibilities with several imperatives, notably
respect for privacy and confidentiality in the exercise of their authority. All training
sessions focused on raising staff members’ awareness on their rights and protection
instruments in the work place.

705. The Ethics Office also reviewed the Code and the Harassment Policy to provide
guidance on the efficient and effective implementation of the African Union values. It
-----------------------Page 121 End-----------------------

                                                                       EX.CL/1134(XXXIV)
                                                                                Page 119

also developed draft policies for elected officials and staff members on gifts, dress code,
financial and asset declarations, conflict of interest management, and whistle-blower
protection.

706. In the course of the reporting period, the Ethics Office received complaints from
over forty (40) staff members about managerial harassment but they did not request the
Ethics Office to pursue the complaint for fear of being further victimised by their
supervisors. The Office also received and deferred five cases to the respective
administrative bodies mandated to consider and provide redress. The Office facilitated
the amicable resolution of two harassment complaints from senior staff member against
supervisees or junior staff members.

707. During the year 2018, staff members demonstrated increased confidence in the
Ethics Office. Over 100 staff members approached it for further verification or
clarification of their rights and protection as provided by the Code and the Harassment
Policy. There was also a notable increase in the number of memos copied to the Office
and seeking administrative redress.

708. Internal audit reports issued during the year ensured that strong internal controls
and accountability are maintained within the Union. The reports were shared with the
AU Board of External Auditors (BoEA), resulting in time and cost savings. The
Commission has also been working on a framework for risk management to assist the
Office of Internal Audit’s preparation of its annual plans and the conduct of its audits.

                 Streamlining the work of Policy Organs

709. During the year 2018, the Commission organized the following meetings of the
Policy Organs:

      i)     the 30th Ordinary Session of the Assembly of Heads of State and
             Government, and the 32nd Ordinary session of the Executive Council, which
             were both held in Addis Ababa in January 2018;

      ii)    the 10th Extraordinary Session of the Assembly of Heads of State and
             Government, and the 18th Extraordinary Session of the Executive Council,
             in Kigali in March 2018;

      iii)   the 31st Ordinary Session of the Assembly of Heads of State and
             Government, and the 33rd Ordinary Session of the Executive Council, in
             Nouakchott in June/July 2018;

      iv)    the 6th Executive Council Retreat in Addis Ababa in September 2018;

      v)     the 19th Extraordinary Session of the Executive Council in Addis Ababa in
             September 2018;
-----------------------Page 122 End-----------------------

                                                                        EX.CL/1134(XXXIV)
                                                                                 Page 120

      vi)   the 11th Extraordinary Session of the Assembly of Heads of State and
            Government, and the 20th Extraordinary Session of the Executive Council in
            Addis Ababa in November 2018.

710. In the same period, the Policy Organs adopted a total of ninety-seven (97)
decisions in 2018, of which fifty-one (51) by the Assembly and forty-six (46) by the
Executive Council. The rationalization of the methods of work of the Policy Organs led
to the reduction in the number of decisions, which in principle should increase the rate
of their implementation.

      II.   Audit

711. The Commission’s Office of Internal Audit (OIA) prepared its plan for the year
2018 using a risk assessment methodology of Audit Management System (MKInsight)
and inputs from management. In addition, the OIA set its audit priorities based on the
results of the mapping exercise on domestication of the First Ten Year of
Implementation Plan of Agenda 2063.

712. The Annual Audit Plan for the year 2018 covered a total of 44 audit projects at
the AU headquarters and the outstation offices – other AU Organs, field missions and
regional, representational and Specialized Offices. It included financial, certification,
compliance, operational (performance audits) as well as information technology (IT)
audits. It also included staff development activities in line with the Institute of Internal
Auditors (IIA) standards.

713. The OIA planned to undertake 44 audit projects during the year 2018. As of
December 2018, the OIA conducted 39 of planned audit projects which are in various
stages of completion (i.e. either final/draft report issued or field work in progress).

714. The Executive Council in its decisions EX.CL/Dec.1020 (XXXIII) and
EX.CL/Dec.1008 (XXXIII) of June 2018, requested the Office of Internal Audit to
conduct a performance audit on the Operations/Budget execution as well as the Human
Resources Recruitment processes of all the AU organs. Accordingly, the Office
conducted performance and recruitment audits of the NEPAD Agency, the AU Anti-
Corruption Board, The African Court of Human and Peoples’ Rights and the African
Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights. The performance and recruitment audits
of the Commission started and will be conducted in phases given the size and
operations of the Commission.

715. The OIA also undertook seven (7) audit projects that were not in the 2018 plan
but were requests from management and six (6) investigation cases.

716. Audit staff development activities were also carried out during the period under
review, including professional trainings and international conferences on current
auditing practices. In addition, through the support of the World Bank and German GIZ,
all OIA staff took ACL training and online training and certification on IPSAS. It should
be noted, however, that the Office has a large proportion of staff who are under Partner
Funds. This leads to high staff turnover since the contracts are mostly on short term
basis.

                                                                           EX.CL/1134(XXXIV)
                                                                                    Page 121


       III.   Strategic Partnerships

717. Agenda 2063 underscores the need for Africa to be a dynamic force and
influential player in the global order. It is therefore critical for the Union to strengthen the
links between AU Organs and the RECs with Regional Offices and Representational
Missions. The Chairperson of the Commission initiated actions to enhance the AU’s
representation in and outside Africa. Such presence will assist in strengthening relations
with the African citizens and Diaspora, as well as expanding AU’s presence in the
territories of its strategic partners.

                 Evaluation of strategic partnerships

718. The Commission facilitated the convening of a retreat of the PRC Sub-
Committee on Multilateral Cooperation in May 2018. The Sub-Committee reviewed and
updated the draft report on the evaluation of strategic partnerships with additional inputs
from the Commission, the RECs, the African Capacity Building Foundation (ACBF) and
the African Union Development Agency-NEPAD Planning and Coordination Agency
(AUDA-NPCA). The Joint PRC-Commission Report on the Evaluation of the Strategic
Partnerships will be submitted for the consideration of the Policy Organs at the February
2019 Summit.

                 Bilateral and multilateral MOUs and partnerships

719. The Commission convened the 2nd African Union Partnerships Coordination and
Interactive Platform (AU-PCIP) in Accra in November 2018. It was the follow-up to the
inaugural AU-PCIP which was organized in Harare in December 2017 and resulted in
the establishment of an African Partnerships Coordination Platform, through which all
relevant stakeholders could develop a common understanding of how the AU plans and
implements its development and integration agenda, identify the challenges and
opportunities and facilitate possibilities for synergy building while avoiding duplication
and conflicting engagements with partners.

720. The 2nd AU-PCIP annual conference, under the title Let’s Act, reviewed, among
others, the implementation of the recommendations adopted at the Harare inaugural
AU-PCIP, exchange views on how to mobilize indigenous support for the actualization
and operationalization of the AU-PCIP and the challenges and opportunities in engaging
with partners. A webpage hosted on the Commission’s website <https://au.int> was
also launched to share content on the Union’s partnership activities.

Africa-Arab

721. The 2016 Malabo Summit of the Africa- Arab Partnerships decided to hold the
next Africa Arab Summit in Saudi Arabia in 2019. The Commission started the
preparations for the Summit with the League of Arab States.

722. In light of the challenges encountered at the Malabo Summit in 2018, the
Commission, in collaboration with the General Secretariat of the League of Arab States,

                                                                        EX.CL/1134(XXXIV)
                                                                                 Page 122

was directed, through Resolutions 7 and 10, to finalize the Action Plan for the
Partnerships and define the criteria and principles for participation at the Africa-Arab
Partnership meetings, respectively. The work is under way and will soon be concluded.

FOCAC

723. During the year under review, the Commission worked closely with the
Government of China in deepening cooperation within the framework of the Forum of
China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC). This resulted, among others, in the incorporation
and adoption of key AU flagship programs within the FOCAC Action Plan for 2018-2021
during the 2018 FOCAC Summit held in Beijing in October 2018.

724. The Government of China also agreed to expedite the construction and
equipping of the Africa CDC, within the framework of the five-year strategic plan
developed by the Africa CDC. The Government of China also committed to earmark
RMB 500 million to that end and in support of other AU projects. The Chinese
Government further offered to provide equipment worth USD 25 million in support of the
AU Logistics Base in Douala, for use by the African Standby Force as part of China’s
USD100 million contribution in support of peace support operations in Africa.

725. Pursuant to the Executive Council’s decision EX.CL/Dec.942(XXX) of January
2017, the Commission has been working with the PRC on mechanisms that will ensure
the AU’s full involvement in the effective management of FOCAC. Meanwhile, the
African Union Office in Beijing was inaugurated during the 2018 FOCAC Summit in
Beijing.

Preparations for TICAD Ministerial Meeting and Summit

726. In preparation for the upcoming TICAD VII Summit, which will take place in
Yokohama from 27 to 30 August 2019, the Commission, in collaboration with the PRC,
has been working with the Government of Japan on key elements of the Summit’s
agenda and program.

727. The preparatory TICAD Ministerial meeting was held in Tokyo in October 2018.
The meeting adopted the 2018 TICAD Report on the implementation of the TICAD V
Action Plans (2013-2017) and TICAD VII Implementation Plan (2016-2019) and
elaborated on the Strategic Direction on the TICAD VII Summit, so as to put the focus
on Africa’s priorities.

728. It should be noted, however, that there was a disagreement at the Tokyo
preparatory meeting over the participation of all Member States to the upcoming
Summit, in line with the relevant AU decisions. It is important that this recurring issue of
participation at TICAD meetings is resolved once and for all to allow full representation
of all AU Member States at future TICAD events.

EU-Africa

729. The African Union-European Union Abidjan Summit Declaration of 2017
requested the two Commissions to develop an action plan, within three months of
adoption of the declaration, that would involve the holding of working level meetings to
identify projects and programs within the AU-EU joint priority areas of cooperation that
both sides agree to implement, and to establish a joint follow-up mechanism. As a follow
up, the Commission submitted to the PRC’s review a draft of priority areas which, after
amendments, will be finalized for final discussions the with EU. The Commission also
started the preparations for the First AU-EU Ministerial meeting to be held in Brussels
on 21-22 January 2019.

730. The African Union and the European Union institutionalized the EU-Africa
Business Forum (EABF) in 2006, to improve the business environment and increase
investment in Africa. The Forum is held alternatively in Africa and Europe. The last
event was held on the margins of the Africa-EU Summit held in Abidjan in November
2017.

Africa-Turkey Partnership

731. As a follow up to the implementation plan for 2015-2019, the second African
Union - Turkey Ministerial Review Conference, which was held in Istanbul in February
2018, adopted a Joint Communique in which both sides identified the need to enhance
cooperation at the multilateral level and start in earnest to prepare for the upcoming
African Union-Turkey Summit to be held in 2019 in Istanbul, Turkey.

732. Within the framework of the Africa-Turkey Partnership and its Action Plan, the
Commission and the Ministry of Trade of the Republic of Turkey convened the Second
Turkey-Africa Economic and Business Forum in Istanbul in October 2018, to promote
Turkish and Africa investments and highlight Agenda 2063’s vision for the continent.
More than 2500 participants, thirty-four (34) Ministers and forty-six (46) Member States
attended the forum. Business to Business and Business to Government meetings were
also held on the sidelines of this event.

733. Three bilateral memoranda of understanding (MoUs) were signed on that
occasion between the Turkish government and various Member States, including a
MoU on cooperation on trade and investment between the Commission and the
Government of Turkey. An implementation strategy and roadmap will be developed in
early 2019. As a way forward, the Commission will continue to engage the private
sector and provide a platform to enhance public-private cooperation and partnerships,
with an emphasis on strengthening small and medium entrepreneurship in Africa.

                Preparations for the Post-Cotonou Negotiations

734. The Executive Council, in its decision EX.CL/Dec. 986 (XXXII) of January 2018,
on the Future of the Post-2020 Cotonou Agreement, requested the Permanent
Representatives Committee (PRC), in close collaboration with the Commission and the
African Group of Ambassadors in Brussels, to finalize an African Common Position on
-----------------------Page 126 End-----------------------

                                                                      EX.CL/1134(XXXIV)
                                                                               Page 124

the future of the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) Group and the Post-2020
Cotonou Agreement. The draft of the African Common Position was submitted for the
consideration of the Extraordinary Session of the Executive Council, held in Kigali in
March 2018 and adopted by the Executive Council [Ext/EX.CL/Dec.2(XVIII)], with the
caveat of allowing one extra month of consultations to further enrich the draft with
comments from African Member States and regions.

735. The final version of the Position was circulated to all African Heads of State and
Government, after which the Chair of the Executive Council led the AU delegation to the
ACP Ministerial Meeting held in Lome in May 2018. The AU ministerial delegation
participated in the ACP-organized “Inter-Agency Consultative Meeting with Regional
and Continental Organizations on the ACP Group's Negotiating Framework for a Post-
Cotonou Agreement with the EU, on 26 May 2018. The meeting, which gathered ACP’s
regional organizations, discussed the negotiating mandate of the ACP countries. The
African Common Position, as presented, was met with lack of unity on the African side
and, for this reason, it was not presented on the following day at the meeting of the ACP
Council of Ministers. At the meeting on 27 May 2018, the ACP Council of Ministers
adopted its negotiating mandate and selected Togo to lead the negotiations on behalf of
the ACP.

736. Subsequently, the Chairperson of the Commission appointed Dr. Carlos Lopes
as his High Representative for AU-EU Partnerships, Post-2020, to provide the required
support to the process through analysis, consultations, and consensus building.

737. The status of implementation of the Kigali Executive Council Decision was
presented and discussed at the 31st Ordinary Session of the Assembly of the Union
held in Nouakchott in July 2018. The Assembly, in its Decision/Assembly/AU/Dec. 694
(XXXI), decided to move forward on an AU – EU Post 2020 agreement that treats Africa
as a united continent, while recognizing the need for further consultations at the
ministerial level to consolidate Africa’s Common Position on its post-2020 relations with
the EU.

738. The Chairperson of the Commission communicated the Assembly’s decision to
the President of the European Commission and the Secretary General of the ACP,
requesting that, in accordance with the Assembly’s request, the commencement of ACP
negotiations should be postponed, pending the consolidation of the African Common
Position. In July 2018, both the ACP Secretary-General and the President of the
European Commission responded, indicating that the negotiations would start on 1
October 2018, partly to allow time for the African side to consolidate its common
position.

739. In preparation for the consultations, Dr Carlos Lopes consulted various
stakeholders and conducted research with the help of the Commission, the UNECA and
other relevant institutions. He submitted a report, which together with the report of the
Chairperson of the Commission, were used as the basis for consultations at the
Executive Council meeting, which was held in Addis Ababa on 14 September 2018, and
expanded to include Ministers in charge of the ACP and EU relations.
-----------------------Page 127 End-----------------------

                                                                      EX.CL/1134(XXXIV)
                                                                               Page 125

740. Following its deliberations, the Executive Council agreed that the negotiations on
the post-Cotonou agreement with the EU would be undertaken under the ACP
framework and should start on 1 October 2018, as scheduled. The Executive Council
further agreed that the Commission would extend technical support to the African
members of the ACP negotiating team, in order to ensure coherence with Agenda 2063,
as well as other relevant instruments. However, Member States did not reach an
agreement on the leadership role to be played by the Commission towards the
conclusion of an Africa-EU partnership Compact between Africa and the EU within the
post-Cotonou framework. As a result, no decision was adopted at the end of the
meeting, except to refer the matter to the Assembly for guidance.

741. Meanwhile, the European Union had adopted its negotiating directives and, soon
thereafter, the ACP adopted its own. Negotiations were launched on the margins of the
UN General Assembly in New York at the end of September 2018.

742. Several discrepancies remained between the ACP and EU directives because
the former had an ACP-wide focus whereas the latter preferred to move the bulk of the
activities to the regions. It should be noted that, in the two negotiating directives, the
post-Cotonou agreement will be a single one, consisting of a foundation agreement and
three regional pillars. The difference lies in the definition of “regions”: while the EU
directives point out the importance of treating Africa as a whole continent, the ACP
regions are limited to the signatories of ACP and therefore do not treat Africa as a whole
continent.

743. At the Assembly’s extraordinary Summit on 18 November 2018, the Chairperson
of the Commission reported on these developments and stressed the importance of
Africa speaking with one voice. In the end, the Assembly, in its decision
Ext/Assembly/AU/Dec.1(XI), decided that the ACP-EU post-Cotonou negotiations
should proceed within the framework of the EU-ACP partnership, and that the
Commission would extend technical support to the African Members of the ACP
negotiating team, as may be requested. The Assembly also decided that the AU-EU
continent-to-continent partnership should continue post 2020, building on the Joint
Africa-EU Strategy and the Declaration of the AU-EU Summit held in Abidjan on 29 and
30 November 2017, in order to advance Agenda 2063 and its priorities with respect to
peace and security, development, the African Continental Free Trade Area, migration
and climate, among others.

744. Since the November 2018 extraordinary Summit, the High Representative
initiated consultations with key stakeholders to lay out the framework of the Continent-
to-Continent Partnership post 2020.        As of the time of this report, the High
Representative had met with the African Group of Ambassadors and with the European
Commission in Brussels. He also held discussions with several Member States and
plans to continue such consultations.

                 AU Regional Offices and Representational Missions

       AU Permanent Mission in Brussels

745. During the period under review, the activities of the AU Permanent Mission in
Brussels (the Brussels Office) focused mainly on: (i) the implementation of existing
cooperation instruments between the African Union and the European Union, namely:
the joint AU-EU strategy and the Agreement of partnership ACP-EU Cotonou; (ii) the
facilitation and coordination of the activities of the Group of African Ambassadors in
Brussels; and (iii) the follow-up of regular working relations with the international
partners based in Brussels.

746. The Brussels Office contributed to the implementation and monitoring of the Joint
AU-EU Strategy and its roadmap for the period 2018-2020, which was adopted by the
5th AU-EU Summit in Abidjan in December 2017. The Office also facilitated the College-
to-College meeting between the AU Commission and the European Commission held in
Brussels on 23 May 2018, as well as the sectoral meetings between the two
Commissions and among the two continents’ leadership.

747. The Brussels Office also strengthened its relations with the European
Commission, the European External Action Service, the European Council and the
European Parliament. AU officials at the Office met regularly with their counterparts in
these institutions to advocate the AU positions on issues of common interest to the two
continents, including on the Post-Cotonou negotiations, Au institutional reforms and
financing, and the implementation of Agenda 2063.

748. The Brussels Office continued to assist the African Group of Ambassadors in
Brussels and coordinate their interactions with the EU and Africa Caribbean Pacific
(ACP) institutions. It is in this perspective that the Office organized in June 2018 for the
African Group and the Regional Economic Communities represented in Brussels a
workshop entitled "Towards an integrated and harmonized approach to the
implementation of the sustainable development program at UN 2030 and the AU
Agenda 2063". The purpose was to update the participants on the progress made by
the Commission in the implementation of the SDGs and Agenda 2063.

749. The Brussels Office also participated in the meetings of the Group of Africa
Caribbean Pacific (ACP) States, including the meetings of the ACP Committee of
Ambassadors and the ACP-EU Parliamentary Assembly held in Brussels in March and
June 2018. In these and other ACP meetings, the Brussels Office contributed to the
harmonization of the positions of AU Member States with the decisions and policies
adopted by the AU Policy Organs. Contacts with the ACP secretariat were
strengthened, and this facilitated the meetings between the President of the AU
Commission and the Secretary General of the ACP that took place in Brussels in
February and May 2018.

750. In general, the Brussels Office achieved significant results during the year 2018.
One of its key tasks in 2019 will be to enhance its working relations with the Group of
African Ambassadors in Brussels and assist Member States in consolidating Africa's

common position on its economic relations with the EU after 2020 in accordance with
the relevant decisions of the Assembly’s extraordinary sessions that took place in Addis
Ababa in November 2018, so that Member States speak with one voice and remain
consistent in their promotion of African interests.

       AU Permanent Delegation in Geneva

751. During the year under review, the AU Permanent Delegation (hereafter the
Geneva Office) in Geneva pursued its effort to support the African Group in Geneva and
coordinate its involvement in the WTO and other fora.

752. With regard to industrialization issues, the Geneva Office worked with all
stakeholders based in Geneva, including UNCTAD, UNIDO, WEF and the Diaspora, to
promote African industrialization, economic diversification and structural transformation
in line with Agenda 2063. Most recently, the Geneva Office co-organized a high-level
panel discussion with UNCTAD and UNIDO on mobilizing investment for inclusive and
sustainable industrial development in Africa on the sidelines of the World Investment
Forum that took place in Geneva in 0ctober 2018. The panel brought together global
leaders in the investment and finance sectors to identify new approaches towards
mobilizing investment for the manufacturing sector in Africa to help strengthen
productive capacity development.

753. In 2018, the African Group in Geneva meeting at the level of Ambassadors
established an African Group for Disarmament issues to be coordinated by Namibia.
The Geneva Office organised meetings and workshops to reinforce the activities of that
Group. One such workshop held on 27 March 2018 was on Lethal Autonomous
Weapons Systems (LAWS).

754. In 2019, it will be the turn of Africa to preside over the UN Human Rights Council.
Senegal was endorsed for this position by the July 2018 Summit in Nouakchott. The
Geneva Office will continue to work with the African Group and other stakeholders to
ensure Senegal’s election to this position. On 5 December 2018, the Ambassador of
Senegal in Geneva was formally elected as President of the Human Rights Council for
the year 2019.

755. African citizens also competed for the positions of Deputy Secretary General and
Director of the Telecommunications Development Bureau within the International
Telecommunications Union in Dubai in October 2018. For the position of Deputy
Secretary General, the candidature of Mr. Brahima Sanou from Burkina Faso was
endorsed by the AU but was not elected. For the position of Director of
Telecommunications Development Bureau there were two candidatures from Nigeria
and Zimbabwe as there was no agreement on a single candidate, nevertheless, none
was elected.

756. The Geneva Office organized fourteen meetings to assist the African Group of
negotiators dealing with intellectual property issues and facilitate the definition of African
common positions. The Office also organised on 8 and 9 November 2019 a workshop
for the African Group to reinforce the capacity of African negotiators; the workshop

                                                                       EX.CL/1134(XXXIV)
                                                                                Page 128

developed, inter alia, positions on issues newly introduced in the WIPO agenda such as
resale rights.

757. It should be noted that the discussions within the technical committees at the
WIPO did not make tangible progress due to the unwillingness of developed countries
to make concessions. Within the WIPO Standing Committee on Copyrights and Related
Rights, western countries opposed any international instrument on exceptions and
limitations to copyrights for the benefit education and research institutions as requested
by developing countries. Western countries also backtracked on discussions on an
international binding instrument for the protection of the rich African traditional
knowledge.

758. The Geneva Office assisted the African Group in the preparation of the 332nd
Session of the Governing Body (GB) and 107th Session of the International Labour
Conference (ILC), of the International Labour Organisation, which was held in Geneva
in March and May/June 2018, respectively.

759. The 332nd session of the ILO Governing Body was important for Africa as it
discussed the revision of the Rules for Regional Meetings. The African Group
successfully lobbied for the revision of the rules on the composition of regional meetings
to ensure that African countries would be the only full members participating in regional
meetings and that countries from other regions could take part as observers and only
when invited. This was a major victory for Africa, given that as recently as 2015,
countries from other regions were able to participate in African region meetings as full
members.

       AU Observer Mission to the United Nations

760. The Permanent Observer Mission of the African Union to the United Nations
(hereafter the New York Office) continued to facilitate interaction and coordination
among the African Group and with the United Nations system at UN headquarters and
ensure that Africa’s strategic priorities remained on the top of the UN agenda.

761. During the period under review, the New York Office worked closely with the
African Group in New York in forging consensus among African negotiators about using
Agenda 2063 to influence the implementation of the global Sustainable Development
Goals (SDGs). In particular, the New York Office assisted the African Group experts
during the 2018 ECOSOC Segment on Operational Activities for Development in
February/March 2018. The session served as a platform for UN member states to begin
the formal consideration of the repositioning of the UN development system (UNDS),
with special focus on the vision, key areas of transformation and the related response to
General Assembly resolution on the quadrennial comprehensive policy review of
operational activities for development of the United Nations. In this session, the African
Group emphasized that the harmonization of the existing AU programmes of action,
including the AU Agenda 2063 and the programme of the New Partnership for Africa’s
Development (NEPAD) with the UN Deputy Secretary-General’s engagement on the
global 2030 Agenda is critical at the earliest possible stage to build synergies at country
level.

762. During the Forty-Ninth Session of the UN Statistical Commission in March 2018,
the New York Office coordinated a side event co-organized by the Commission and UN-
ECA to inform the African Group and relevant stakeholders on the progress regarding
the development of statistics on the continent, and a consultative meeting between the
Commission and the African Directors-General of National Statistics. The purpose of
this meeting was to exchange views on modalities to improve coordination,
collaboration and communication between the Commission and the African Directors-
General of National Statistics offices, representing AU Member States during the
upcoming Session of the UN Statistical Commission in 2019.

763. The New York Office, in conjunction with the Coordinator of the Committee of
Ten (Sierra Leone) and the Permanent Missions of the Committee of the Ten on
Security Council Reform, organized a three-day retreat in New York in April 2018, to
deliberate on the on-going Intergovernmental Negotiations on Security Council reform.
The retreat decided to prepare an Aide-Memoire for the C-10 Heads of State in their
engagement with the UN Security Council’s P-5 members and develop a consensual
strategy for the African Union Heads of State and Government of the Committee of Ten
on Security Council reform to engage with the interested regional groups as well as
guide the participation of the African Group at the IGN meetings.

764. The retreat also developed a draft Common African Position on Security Council
reform to be used in their national statements during the General Debate of the 73 rd
Session of the UN General Assembly and other international fora. Furthermore, the
Office facilitated the preparation and organization of the Ministerial Retreat of the
Committee of Ten held in Freetown Sierra Leone in December 2018, the outcome of
which will be presented to the February 2019 Summit.

765. The New York Office took part in the High-Level Conference of Counter-
Terrorism Agencies of Member States, which was organized by the UN Secretary
General in New York in June 2018. The meeting’s theme of Strengthening International
Cooperation to Combat the Evolving Threat of Terrorism reflected on the need for
Member States to improve international counter-terrorism cooperation and the practical
steps for the implementation of relevant aspects of the United Nations Global Counter-
Terrorism Strategy.

766. The New York Office also participated at the United Nations Forum held in New
York in May 2018 on the question of Palestine under the theme 70 Years After 1948 -
Lesson to Achieve a Sustainable Peace. It was declared that the State of Palestine is
designated to lead the Group 77 and China for 2019.

767. In the area of peace and security, the New York Office continued to improve its
collaboration with the African Members of the Security Council (A3) for better
coordination and cohesion of African issues within the UN Security Council. The A3
continued to be faced with dealing with external pressures particularly when defending
African Union decisions that are incompatible with external competing interests.

                                                                             Page 130

768. The AU’s efforts to secure predictable and sustainable funding through UN
assessed contributions for AU-led peace support operations mandated by the Security
Council gained momentum in 2018 with a roadmap developed by the A3 – Côte d’Ivoire,
Egypt and Ethiopia – to facilitate the final resolution of this issue.

769. During the reporting period, the New York Office supported the July 2018 joint
UN-AU Solidarity Mission to Chad, Niger and South Sudan, which was led by the AU
Special Envoy on Women, Peace and Security and the UN Deputy Secretary-General
along with the UN-Women Executive Director of UN-Women. The AU Special Envoy
and the UN Deputy Secretary General briefed the UN Security Council on the outcomes
of the mission in July 2018.

770. The New York Office assisted the African Group in negotiations, alongside the
G77 and China and the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM), for the attainment of the 2030
SDGs agenda and other internationally agreed development goals, the promotion of
human rights and fundamental freedoms for all through adequate funding and the
transfer of technology, as a way to boost socio-economic development in the LDCs. The
African Group and its allies proposed the adoption of a Convention on the Right to
Development as a legally binding instrument which will push the implementation of the
right to development.

771. The Mission also supported the participation of the African Group at the 62nd
Session of the Commission on the Status of Women which was held in March 2018,
under the theme “Challenges and Opportunities in Achieving Gender Equality and the
Empowerment of Rural Women and Girls”. A significant outcome of this session was the
agreement reached by the African Group, the G77 and China and the NAM to host a
high-level meeting on the Fight Against Tuberculosis, and a third high-level meeting on
non-communicable diseases in 2018. The three groups of states also agreed to host a
high-level meeting in 2019 on universal health coverage.

      AU Representational Mission to the United States – Washington D.C. Office

772. During the year 2018, the AU Representational Mission to the United States of
America-Washington DC Office continued to promote AU’s priorities in the United
States and strengthen the AU-US strategic partnership, particularly in the areas of
economic development, investment and trade, and the mobilization of the African
diaspora in enhancing US-Africa relations.

773. The Washington DC Office intensified its advocacy efforts with the US
Administration, both Houses of Congress and the think-tank community. It also assisted
the African Ambassadors Group to the United States in coordinating African common
positions on various issues, particularly following statements made by the current
Administration vis-à-vis the continent. Given the importance of the US legislative
branch, the Office advocated the need for the United States to engage Africa as an
equal partner on the basis of shared interests and common values. Emphasis has been
given to the importance of the US support to AU peace support operations, as well as
future US-Africa relations beyond African Growth and Opportunities Act (AGOA) in light
of the establishment of the African Continental Free Trade Area.

774. Working with the Commission’s Department of Trade and Industry and the
African AGOA Eligible Countries, the Washington DC Office organized a series of
meetings leading to the annual AGOA Ministerial Forum held at the State Department in
Washington, DC. These meetings were (i) the Midterm Review in June 2018, which took
stock of AGOA’s key milestones and challenges; and (ii) the AGOA Ministerial
Consultative Meeting, which took place in July 2018 prior to the AGOA Forum.

775. The Washington DC Office took an active part in the 17th annual AGOA Forum,
which was convened by the US State Department in Washington, DC, in July 2018
under the theme “Forging new strategies for US-Africa Trade and Investment”. The
Forum focused on the implementation of AGOA, in light of the US Government’s new
trade and foreign policy priorities. Participants exchanged views on strategies to
improve trade relations between the US and Africa as a united bloc rather than on a
bilateral basis as is currently the case, as well as the future of US-Africa economic
relations after AGOA’s expiration in 2025.

776. The Washington DC Office hosted in October 2018 a follow-up meeting to tackle
the issues raised by the AGOA Trade and Industry Ministers at the Forum, between the
group of African Ambassadors and a US inter-agency delegation led by Ms. Connie
Hamilton, Assistant US Trade Representative for Africa. The meeting set the ground for
the next high-level engagement on the future of US-Africa economic relations between
the African Ambassadors and Deputy US Trade Representative Ambassador C.J.
Mahony in November 2018.

777. The 6th edition of the AU Commission-United States of America (AU-US) High-
Level Dialogue took place in Addis Ababa on 29 November 2018. It was co-chaired by
the Deputy Chairperson of the Commission and the US Assistant Secretary of State for
African Affairs. The High-Level Dialogue provided an opportunity to review the progress
made in the implementation of the various aspects of cooperation under the four
interdependent pillars that govern the AU-US Strategic Partnership, namely: (i) peace
and security; (ii) economic growth, trade and investment; (iii) democracy and
governance; and (iv) promoting investment opportunities and development.

778. Both sides reaffirmed their strong commitments to deepening and broadening
their partnership in all these areas to achieve the AU’s vision of an “integrated,
prosperous and peaceful Africa”. They also agreed particularly on the value of
convening an annual forum for trade and investment to promote economic partnerships
and expand the utilization of the African Growth and Opportunity Act at the regional and
continental levels.

779. The AU Office in Washington, DC, in collaboration with the U.S. Agency for
International Development and the Diaspora Business Council, organized in
Washington, DC, in November 2018 the Diaspora Trade and Investment Conference.
This conference facilitated the initiation of linkages between the African Diaspora
business community with trade and investment counterparts from African countries, as
well as trade-related agencies in the United States and Africa. More than two hundred
participants and ten Diaspora trade associations, representing more than 300 Black

                                                                                 Page 132

Chambers of Commerce representing various industry sectors, as well as seven U.S.
government international development agencies, took part in the Conference.

780. The First Annual Diaspora Retreat was also organised by the Mission in
Baltimore, Maryland in December 2018. More than 150 participants took part in the one-
day retreat, including representatives of the African Diaspora groups from different
states and provinces in the USA, Canada and Europe from Canada and Europe. The
Retreat adopted the Constitutive Act of the African Union Diaspora 6 th Region Network
applicable to the African Diaspora in the US only. It also launched the African Diaspora
Savings and Investment Account as an innovative instrument to invest in the African
Centers of Excellence (WAKANDA) in each region of the continent.

781. The Washington DC Office continued to coordinate the monthly meetings and
host the major activities of the African Ambassadors Group (AAG) in its capacity as the
Secretariat of the Group. It is encouraging to note that African Ambassadors are
increasingly speaking with one voice on issues of common interest between the US and
Africa.

      IV.   Communication and Outreach

782. During the period under review, the Commission enhanced its efforts to increase
the visibility of the AU through various traditional and online media and digital platforms.
The Commission completed the AU Brand Identity & Style Guide to ensure common
alignment in the use of the AU Brand iconography in all communication channels across
the Union. The Commission also initiated work on realigning the AU Organs with the AU
corporate brand identity. The new website of the African Committee of Experts on the
Rights and Welfare of the Child (ACERWC) was launched with this updated visual
identity.

783. Between January and July 2018, the Commission reached out to around 20
million people via Facebook, registering 355,000 followers. This represents an increase
of 9.5% over 2017. For Twitter, the Commission recorded 6.1 million tweets and
215,000 followers representing an increase of 24% compared to 2017. Furthermore,
there were 150,000 views on YouTube, an increase of 19% from 2017, and 1,799

143,184 views from January to July 2018, compared with 113,000 for the full year in
2017.

785. The Know the AU campaign continued during the year under review. The
campaign’s aim is to popularise and educate African citizens on the African Union
history, structures and functions thereby contributing to the goal of bringing the African
Union to its citizens. The objective of campaign is to increase engagement with the AU
citizen by directing online traffic to AU digital platforms such as the AU website and
social media pages to learn more about the AU.

Know the AU campaign. The documentaries were finalized in December 2018 and will
begin to air in 2019. The flagship projects are Silencing the Guns by 2020, the African
Continental Free Trade Area, the African Commodity Strategy, the Grand Inga Dam and
the integrated High Speed Train.

787. During the period under review, the Commission completed the mapping,
architectural design and layout of the new AU Studio, which will be installed in the New
Conference Centre at AU Headquarters. Construction work is expected to begin in the
second semester of 2018.

788. The Commission, working with the Government of New Zealand, continued the
publication of the annual AU Handbook. 2500 copies were distributed during the AU
Summits in 2018. Production of the 2019 edition ongoing with delivery expected at the
February 2019 Summit.

789. In collaboration with the Government of Rwanda and Rwanda’s Nyundo Music
School, the Commission’s Department of Information and Communication began the
production of the AU Anthem in English, Arabic, French, Portuguese, Spanish and
Kiswahili. The audio production was to be released in December 2018. This project was
also supported by the Embassies and Permanent Representations of Tanzania and
Equatorial Guinea to the AU, which provided the Swahili and Spanish translations of the
AU Anthem, respectively.

790. The Commission’s Department of Information and Communication launched, in
collaboration with the NEPAD Agency, the Agenda 2063 Network of Journalists
representing all the AU regions. The objective of the Network is to promote AU activities
related to Agenda 2063, giving importance to Africa’s voices in telling Africa’s story and
sharing ideas on how Africa’s media can better build the narrative of the continent.

791. During the period under review, the Commission increased its outreach activities
to the African citizenry and beyond. Several media briefings were held and over 300
press releases issued and disseminated through media database, the AU website and
social media channels.

794. The Commission deployed a new project entitled the African Knowledge Base
(AKB) Platform, which is accessible at <http://akb.africa-union.org>. The objective is to
enhance information sharing and the search and retrieval of current publications by the
AU, the RECs, and other AU-affiliated organizations from a single website and
interlinked databases. As at this reporting, the platform was introduced to eight regional
and international organizations and academic institutions. All institutions began using
and contributing to the Platform. In the future, the AKB Platform will serve as an
integrated database of African local contents and indigenous knowledge.

M.     CONCLUSION AND THE WAY FORWARD FOR 2019

795. This Report on the Activities of the Union and Its Organs highlights some of the
significant achievements the Union made in 2018 and for which the continent can take a
legitimate pride. These achievements are a tangible demonstration of the impact of the
Union’s transformative agenda and its contribution to improving the livelihoods for
African citizens. Their reinforcement and the need for a better outreach to make them
known to African citizens will continue to engage the attention of the Commission, other
Organs and Specialized Agencies in 2019.

796. Many challenges still persist. Conflicts and violence remain a reality that affects
the lives of large segments of the African population. The democratization process and
the promotion of good governance are still fraught with difficulties. Poverty and misery
are the daily lot of hundreds of millions of people even though the continent is endowed
with wealth and talent. The voice of Africa on the international stage is still insufficiently
taken into account, even though the continent represents more than a quarter of the
membership of the United Nations.

797. With Agenda 2063, Africa through the Union has developed a roadmap that
clearly articulates the path forward for its transformation. The year 2019 offers the
opportunity to move faster to break the multiple chains that hinder the actualization of
Africa's rich human and natural potential. From this point of view, nothing is more
decisive than the deepening of continental unity. As the Chairperson of the Commission
has pointed out many times, “With unity we are everything. Without it, we are nothing”.
