    President’s foreword
    2020 was a year in which rural people faced unprecedented
    challenges.
    Already coping with the impacts of climate change, environmental pressures, pest
    and disease outbreaks, inequality and economic downturns, 2020 brought with it
    a global pandemic that threatened to disrupt global food systems and significantly
    roll back years of progress in the fight against poverty and hunger.


         203                          IFAD financing
                                    US$7.5 billion             123     million
         ongoing                                               people reached
         projects




    This was a situation like no other the world had faced in many decades. We
    had to act fast and decisively to protect rural livelihoods and keep food systems
    functioning. At the same time, we could not lose sight of our responsibility, as
    enshrined in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), to chart a pathway
    to the long-term food security, poverty reduction, resilience and the inclusive
    transformation of rural communities.




                      2020 was also
                      about building for
                      the future

                                              But to respond to
                                              the scale of the
                                              crisis, we needed
                                              to do more



                        Responding quickly, but thinking long term

                        As the pandemic struck, IFAD country teams immediately
                        began working with governments to adjust ongoing projects
                        so rural people could maintain their income-generating
                        activities and not be forced to sell their meagre assets.
                        Major priorities included ensuring seeds were available for the upcoming
                        planting season, and using digital solutions to help small-scale farmers reach
                        customers and sell their produce. Our first restructured project was in Bosnia
                        and Herzegovina: by the end of March, partnering with the government, we had
                        provided support packages to 9,000 vulnerable households, including seedlings
                        and fertilizer so farmers could maintain production for local markets. But it soon
                        became clear that the scale of the crisis called for us to do more. We needed to
                        partner more with governments to reach more rural people – and support them
                        with timely access to inputs, information, markets and liquidity.

                        In April, we launched the Rural Poor Stimulus Facility (RPSF). IFAD provided
                        US$40 million to kick-start the RPSF and raised over US$50 million through
                        generous contributions from Canada, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden and
                        Switzerland. As the pandemic continues, the RPSF is supporting rural people to
                        stay on their feet economically and is contributing to the continued availability of
                        food. As more funding and support comes in for the RPSF, we expect to do even
                        more in 2021.

    2020 was also about building for the future, ensuring IFAD
    is in a position to lead the recovery and getting back on
    track to meet the SDGs, especially to end extreme poverty
    and hunger. This has meant revamping our financial
    architecture so we can invest more and reach more rural
    people – while maintaining financial discipline and
    managing risks.
    Core contributions remain the bedrock of IFAD’s funding. At the same time,
    our financial credentials have been recognized and the opportunity to mobilize
    more resources has been enhanced by a strong credit rating obtained during the
    year, from both Fitch and Standard and Poor’s. Our new integrated borrowing
    framework will further enable us to manage the risks associated with a more
    ambitious financial model, and ensure IFAD’s financial sustainability.

        Domestic                              International
        contributions                         cofinancing
        US$5.7 billion
                                  $
                                              US$4.9 billion
                                                                         $
    Doing more to build the resilience of rural people does not
    only mean scaling up investments – it also means going
    further to reach the people most likely to be left behind.
    In 2020, among important initiatives were our revised targeting guidelines. These
    guidelines will ensure that the principle of leaving no one behind guides all of
    IFAD’s operational activities. We also expanded our partnerships with indigenous
    peoples – more than 10 times as many indigenous peoples’ groups participated
    in the preparations for IFAD’s Fifth Global Meeting of the Indigenous Peoples’
    Forum.

    In 2020, we also piloted approaches for greater inclusion of persons with
    disabilities in IFAD-supported projects. And we started activities in five countries
    for a “grass-roots approach to connecting youth voices to action”, which will
    enable us to do even more to include young people in our projects in the
    years ahead.

    2020 saw continued progress in refining IFAD’s business processes, so we
    can achieve better results faster. We prepared a new policy for regular grants
    financing, which by early 2021 was under implementation. The new policy will
    ensure that regular grants achieve greater impact on the ground for rural people,
    especially by promoting synergies with our other, non-grants-based activities, and
    by strengthening learning processes.

                                                Doing more also means
                                                going further to reach
                                                the people most likely
                                                to be left behind


                         In addition, we are becoming more efficient in both our
                         lending and our non-lending activities through ongoing
                         decentralization.
                         In 2020, the share of IFAD staff in the field reached 32 per cent, compared with
                         10 per cent during the IFAD10 (2016-2018) period. Having more staff on the
                         ground is helping us to do more in terms of partnerships and policy engagement,
                         and it is helping us to translate our global engagement activities into action at
                         the local level. This is ever-more important as we prepare for the United Nations
                         Food Systems Summit in 2021. IFAD’s experience and knowledge will provide key
                         inputs into the Summit, and our presence on the ground in rural areas will put us
                         on the front line in implementing the outcomes of the Summit in the years ahead,
                         in coordination with our partners.

                         Despite the challenges of 2020, we remain convinced that our vision of a world
                         free of poverty and hunger is attainable. To achieve this, the rural women and
                         men IFAD serves need to be better prepared to overcome the challenges they face.
                         And we need to ensure they have the support they need so they can withstand the
                         shocks of today and tomorrow. We will keep striving to do more and to get better
                         at what we do so that, together, we can all make this a reality.

                                             The COVID-19 pandemic added to the range of threats
                                             affecting rural livelihoods – including the increasingly stark

                                             inequality, disempowerment and economic downturns.

     More investment in rural resilience is needed


     Though challenges are particularly severe, investments to build the
     resilience of rural livelihoods remain woefully insufficient.

     Addressing the socio-economic impacts
     of the COVID-19 pandemic

     When the pandemic struck early in 2020, IFAD launched the Rural Poor
     Stimulus Facility, a funding mechanism to help the most vulnerable and
     marginalized people sustain themselves through the crisis and to accelerate
     the recovery of rural communities.

     RESPONDING TO THE PANDEMIC



                       In 2020,
                                                The 53 projects are
                                                expected to reach
                US$36.6 million
                   approved                     around
                for 53 projects                 1.6 million
                that respond directly to
                 the COVID emergency
                                                beneficiaries
                through the Rural Poor
                    Stimulus Facility.                                70% to Africa


                                               49% to low-income
                                               countries
                                               47% to countries in
                                               fragile situations




           We also repurposed funds within existing projects
              to finance the COVID-19 response activities.

                                       In 2020, we approved
                                       repurposing of

                                    US$171 million
                                    of project funds
                                    in 33 countries
                                       that provided tailored
                                       support for project
                                       participants.

                                                   to ensure that the availability of resources is

                          Rural people in Asia and the Pacific face a range
                          of challenges and threats, with climate-related
                          hazards being among the most severe. For groups
                          who have traditionally faced exclusion, these
                          threats are exacerbated, resulting in increasing
                          risks of poverty and marginalization transmitting
                          across generations.
                            The impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic have
                          added to existing vulnerabilities, undermining
                          food systems and livelihoods in the region. Some
                          countries that depend on food imports have
                          suffered shortages, while market closures and the
                          threat of soaring food prices have increased the
                          risk of social unrest.

                      Overall, 2020 was a challenging year in the East
                      and Southern Africa region. The COVID-19
                      pandemic, combined with locust invasions and
                      aggravated risks related to climate change, has
                      posed serious threats to rural people’s livelihoods.
                      Economic activity has suffered from disruptions
                      in the movement of people and goods and from
                      declining global commodity prices. For the first
                      time in 20 years, GDP in the region declined.
                      IFAD’s focus during 2020 was to strengthen the
                      resilience of small-scale farmers, while advancing
                      an inclusion agenda that concentrated primarily
                      on young people and women.

                                                                                   “The future is still great. With the

                     governments of Egypt, Jordan, Tunisia and
                     Yemen to assess the impact of the pandemic on
                     agricultural investments. AIDA is also helping
                     these governments to shape policy responses to
                     the crisis that are sensitive to the needs of rural
                     communities and contribute to the resilience of
                     food systems more generally.

                     Before the COVID-19 pandemic, the West and
                     Central Africa region was home to some of
                     the world’s fastest-growing economies. But the
                     pandemic, along with issues such as floods,
                     droughts, political unrest and increasing
                     fragility, has stalled regional growth. Poverty
                     levels are expected to worsen. And the socio-
                     economic impacts of the pandemic are adversely
                     affecting the most vulnerable groups, limiting
                     their access to markets, agricultural inputs and
                     financial services.
                       IFAD continues to deepen its involvement in
                     West and Central Africa, increasing investments

                        Our partnerships with farmers’ organizations
                     have been an important avenue for responding
                     to the pandemic. We consulted regional farmers’
                     organizations to ensure the resources of the

                     maintaining consistency with the objectives of
                     the programme. This resulted in the FO4ACP
                     COVID-19 Continuity Plan, which enabled
                     farmers’ organizations to invest in the safety
                     of their people, provide essential and accurate
                     information to support their members, and work
                     creatively to find solutions to the new challenges.

                     to the threats that the pandemic poses to food
                     systems. Together, the RBAs led the drafting of the

     Leading the way in sustainable and
     ethical business practices
     While our projects have done much to support
     rural people in sustainably managing the
     natural resources their livelihoods depend
     on, we also want IFAD to be a global leader in
     environmentally sustainable business practices.
     We need to lead by example.
       That’s why we are continuing our commitment
     to implement and maintain environmentally
     friendly initiatives. We are further reducing
     our energy use and cutting water consumption,
     while increasing biodiversity in the grounds of
     our headquarters. We are also cutting down on
     non-recyclable waste and decreasing paper usage.
     These and other initiatives have enabled us to
     maintain our platinum certification for Leadership
     in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED),
     the highest green building certification available
     worldwide.
       Throughout the year, we continued to advance
     an ethical culture within everything IFAD does.
     Much was achieved in particular in preventing
     sexual exploitation and abuse (SEA), within our
     projects and our workplace. Major initiatives
     involved increasing education and prevention
     outreach with implementing partners on
     SEA; and training SEA focal points in how to
     promote IFAD’s no tolerance stance. In addition,
     corporate-wide efforts to implement the United
     Nations Secretary General’s recommendations on
     addressing Hate Speech and racism within the
     United Nations are also key to ensuring a safe and
     ethical working culture within IFAD.

                          A future without poverty and
                          hunger is attainable

                          2020 has further underlined that
                          IFAD’s mandate is critical for
                          global stability, for the resilience
                          of food systems, and to end
                          poverty and hunger.
                          We will continue to do what we have always done:
                          working with the poorest people in the most

(h) Currency risk
Currency risk arises from the potential for losses
stemming from changes in foreign exchange rates.
IFAD's Asset And Liability Management Framework is
guided by the principle of adequately managing the
currency composition of its assets and liabilities, so
as to limit losses deriving from fluctuations or an
adverse reduction in IFAD’s financing capacity.

In the case of misalignments that are considered
persistent and significant, IFAD undertakes a
realignment procedure by changing the currency
