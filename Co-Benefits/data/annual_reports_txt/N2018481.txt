52 resolutions and 15 presidential statements and issued
67 statements to the press. During the reporting period,
the Council conducted five missions. The Council
visited Côte d’Ivoire and Guinea-Bissau in February;
Burkina Faso and Mali in March; Iraq and Kuwait in
June; Colombia in July; and Ethiopia and South Sudan
in October. On 22 October, during the visit to Ethiopia,

African Union held their thirteenth annual joint
consultative meeting, which was focused on the Central
African Republic, Libya, South Sudan and the Sahel.

conflicts remained severe. Common ground was not
always within reach, especially on the most sensitive
and high-profile issues.
3.
The situations in Africa remained a focus of the
Council. Frequent meetings were held on the Central
African Republic, Libya and South Sudan. The

The Council was briefed concerning the political,
socioeconomic and humanitarian situation in Burundi in
February, June and October. According to the briefers,
the security situation in the country remained generally
calm, with a trend towards improvement, although a
number of human rights violations continued to be
reported. Some progress had been made in repatriating
refugees and the Government had initiated serious
preparatory efforts for the elections planned for 20 May
2020. The socioeconomic and humanitarian situation in
the country remained difficult, with about 1.8 million

11. During 2019, the Council focused its work on
support for regional and international efforts to assist
the implementation of the Political Agreement for Peace
and Reconciliation in the Central African Republic,
which had been negotiated in Khartoum under the
auspices of the African Union and signed by
representatives of the authorities of the Central African
Republic and 14 armed groups in Bangui on 6 February
2019. In February, in a statement to the press, the
Council welcomed the signing of the Agreement and
urged the stakeholders to implement it. In March, in a
statement to the press, the Council welcomed the
consensus reached by the signatory parties regarding the
formation of an inclusive Government. During 2019, the
security and humanitarian challenges in the Central
African Republic also remained in the focus of the
Council.
12. In November, the Council adopted resolution 2499
(2019), by which it extended the mandate of the United
Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization
Mission in the Central African Republic (MINUSCA)
until 15 November 2020 and authorized MINUSCA to
support the implementation of the Political Agreement
for Peace and Reconciliation and assist the authorities
of the Central African Republic in the preparation and
delivery of the presidential, legislative and local
elections in 2020 and 2021.
13. With regard to the sanctions regime, in January,
the Council adopted resolution 2454 (2019), in which it

Central African Republic until 31 January 2020. In
April, the Council issued a presidential statement
(S/PRST/2019/3), in which it established benchmarks
and conducted a review of the arms embargo, which led
to the adoption of resolution 2488 (2019), in which the
Council eased the arms embargo measures on the
Government of the Central African Republic.
14. In Darfur, although the security situation improved
overall, the region witnessed local clashes between
government forces and the armed opposition, in addition
to displacement and criminality. The Council closely
monitored the political developments in Khartoum,
including the establishment of transitional institutions,
and their possible implications for the Darfur region. In
June, the Council issued a statement to the press
strongly condemning the recent violence in the Sudan
and expressing regret for the loss of lives and injuries
among civilians. In August, the Council issued a

15. In February, in its resolution 2455 (2019), the
Council extended until 12 March 2020 the mandate of
the Panel of Experts on the Sudan. Also in that
resolution, the Council expressed its intention to
establish benchmarks that could serve in guiding it to
review the measures on Darfur. The drawdown of the
African Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in
Darfur (UNAMID) and the process of moving from
peacekeeping to peacebuilding activities in the region in
the light of the overall developments in the country was
the focus of Council discussions on Darfur in 2019. In
June, the Council adopted resolution 2479 (2019), by
which it extended the mandate of UNAMID for four
months. In October, by its resolution 2495 (2019) and in
response to the request by the Government of the Sudan,
the Council further extended the mandate of UNAMID
until 31 October 2020 and expressed its intention to

the responsible drawdown and exit of UNAMID and on
establishing a follow-on presence to UNAMID.
16. The Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court
briefed the Council in relation to the situation in Darfur
in June and December.

the Council, which maintained its firm support for the
efforts of the African Union and the Intergovernmental
Authority on Development (IGAD) to address the crisis
and assist the South Sudanese parties in implementing
the Revitalized Agreement on the Resolution of the
Conflict in South Sudan of 12 September 2018. The
Council remained concerned by sporadic armed clashes
across the country and repeatedly called upon the parties
to uphold the Agreement on Cessation of Hostilities,
Protection of Civilians and Humanitarian Access of
21 December 2017.

Introduction

by the Agreement. The Council also called upon the
parties to expedite the implementation of transitional
security arrangements and to continue consultations
towards a common solution regarding the number and
boundaries of states.
21. In November, the parties to the Agreement decided
to extend the pre-transitional period by 100 days, which
was approved by IGAD. In that regard, the Council
issued a statement to the press in which it expressed
disappointment that the parties had failed to form a
revitalized transitional Government of national unity by
the 12 November deadline, and emphasized that full
implementation of all provisions of the Agreement
would set the country towards the goals of peace,
stability, justice and development.
22. The Council continued to lend its support to the
United Nations Interim Security Force for Abyei
(UNISFA) as an essential tool for the stability of the
border regions between the Sudan and South Sudan. In
April, by its resolution 2465 (2019), the Council
extended until 15 October 2019 the support provided by
UNISFA to the Joint Border Verification and Monitoring
Mechanism. In May, by its resolution 2469 (2019), the
Council extended the mandate of UNISFA until
15 November 2019 and reduced the troop ceiling to
3,550, while increasing the police ceiling to
640 personnel. In October, by its resolution 2492
(2019), the Council renewed until 15 November 2019
the support provided by UNISFA to the Joint Border

by its resolution 2497 (2019), the Council extended the
UNISFA mandate, including the support to the
Mechanism, until 15 May 2020, maintained the troop
ceiling at 3,550 and decided to postpone the withdrawal
of the additional 295 troops.
23. The situation in the Democratic Republic of the
Congo and its implications for security in the Great
Lakes region was a focus of the work of the Council.
The Council followed closely the situation in the
country after the presidential elections, which were held
at the end of December 2018. In January, in a statement
to the press, the members of the Council welcomed the
peaceful holding of the elections. Noting the disputes
lodged before the Constitutional Court, they encouraged
all concerned stakeholders to take up any reservations
through the proper mechanisms and processes provided
for in the Constitution of the Democratic Republic of the
Congo and its electoral law. In August, in another
statement to the press, the Council welcomed the efforts
of the President, Félix Tshisekedi, towards
reconciliation, the steps he had taken to open political
space and his initiatives to promote regional
cooperation. In a statement to the press in October, the
10/205

members of the Council welcomed the inauguration of
the new coalition Government and encouraged it to
place the needs of the Congolese people above the
pursuit of partisan interests. In addition, the members of
the Council called on the Armed Forces of the
Democratic Republic of the Congo (FARDC) to
strengthen their efforts to tackle armed groups and
called upon FARDC and the United Nations
Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic
Republic of the Congo (MONUSCO) to work together
more effectively.
24. The security situation remained fragile in the east
of the country, notably in North Kivu, South Kivu and
Ituri provinces. On 30 October, after concentrating over
20,000 troops in Beni territory, FARDC launched a
unilateral offensive operation against the Allied
Democratic Forces (ADF), to which the ADF responded
with attacks against civilians and Ebola response teams.
The significant number of civilian casualties resulting
from the ADF attacks was one of the main triggers of
the violent demonstrations against MONUSCO that
took place in Beni in mid-November and December. The
Council reviewed the situation in Beni in closed
consultations twice. In March, the Council adopted
resolution 2463 (2019), in which it requested the
Secretary-General to conduct and provide it with an
independent strategic review of MONUSCO by
20 October 2019, and reaffirmed that the Mission’s
strategic priorities should remain the protection of
civilians and support to the stabilization and
strengthening of State institutions and to governance
and security reforms. It also extended the mandate of the
Mission for nine months.
25. In October, the Secretary-General submitted to the
Council the independent strategic review report
prepared by a team of experts headed by Youssef
Mahmoud (S/2019/842). The report contained
recommendations on adjustments to the Mission and the
responsible and phased drawdown of MONUSCO. It
also included best- and worst-case scenarios for the
situation on the ground and options for the future
configuration of MONUSCO.
26. In December, the Council adopted resolution 2502
(2019), by which it extended the mandate of
MONUSCO, including its Intervention Brigade, until
20 December 2020. Also in that resolution, the Council
took note of the independent strategic review and
requested the Government and the Secretary-General to
articulate a joint strategy to specify the conditions
needed for the drawdown of MONUSCO and its
eventual exit from the country. The Council also
reduced the troop ceiling of the Mission to 14,000
military personnel and decided that protection of
20-09564

-----------------------Page 12 End-----------------------

Report of the Security Council to the General Assembly for 2019

civilians should remain one of the strategic priorities of
MONUSCO, including its Intervention Brigade. It also
welcomed the Secretary-General’s decision to send an
evaluation mission to assess the ability of the
Intervention Brigade to effectively deliver on its
mandate to protect civilians.
27. The Council continued to support the sanctions
regime against the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
On 26 June, the Council adopted resolution 2478 (2019),
renewing until 1 July 2020 the sanctions imposed
against the designated individuals and entities. It also
decided to extend the mandate of the Group of Experts
on the Democratic Republic of the Congo until 1 August
2020.
28. The Council continued to monitor the
humanitarian situation in the Democratic Republic of
the Congo closely, including a new outbreak of Ebola.
On 31 July, it held an informal interactive dialogue on
the matter. On 2 August, the Council adopted a
presidential statement (S/PRST/2019/6), in which it
expressed grave concern about the Ebola virus outbreak
in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and
emphasized the need for broad cooperation in the
response. Also in that presidential statement, the
Council expressed its serious concern regarding the
attacks on humanitarian and medical personnel engaged
in medical duties and stressed the need for Governments
and civil society in affected and at-risk countries to
improve their preparedness, as well as to implement
optimal vaccine strategies.
29. The Council continued to follow relations between
Djibouti and Eritrea. In February and August, the
Secretary-General updated the Council on the
developments towards the normalization of relations
between the two countries. During the reporting period,
the situation on the border remained stable and the two
countries refrained from any negative rhetoric and
continued maintaining diplomatic relations. The
remaining differences should be solved through
dialogue.
30. The Council followed the political, humanitarian
and security situation in Somalia closely. It noted, in
particular, the importance of security sector, economic
and political reforms. The significance of strengthening
the cooperation between the Federal Government of
Somalia and the federal member states was a consistent
theme of Council discussions throughout the year. In a
statement to the press in January, the Council expressed
its regret at the decision of the Federal Government of
Somalia to declare the Special Representative of the
Secretary-General for Somalia, Nicholas Haysom,
persona non grata, underlined its full support for the
20-09564

United Nations Assistance Mission in Somalia
(UNSOM) and its mandate and underscored the strong
and continued commitment of the international
community to supporting peace, stability and
development in the country.

to Somali security institutions. In May, the Council
adopted resolution 2472 (2019), in which it decided to
reduce the authorized number of uniformed AMISOM
personnel to a maximum of 19,626 by 28 February 2020
and expressed its intention to follow closely the
implementation of the transition plan and handover of
security responsibilities, with the aim of Somali security
institutions taking the lead by December 2021.
34. In November, the Council adopted resolution 2498
(2019), by which it renewed the sanctions and arms
embargo on Somalia and the ban on the import and
export of Somali charcoal. It also introduced restrictions
on transfers to Somalia of components of improvised
explosive devices and extended the mandate of the Panel
of Experts on Somalia until 15 December 2020. The
Council expressed its full support for the work of the
Panel of Experts throughout the year and called upon the
Somalian authorities to work with the Panel.
35. In a statement to the press on 25 November, the
Council underlined the importance of holding a
peaceful, inclusive, credible and transparent oneperson-one-vote election and called upon the Federal
Government of Somalia and the federal member states
to resume dialogue in order to resolve outstanding
issues.
36. On 4 December, the Council adopted resolution
2500 (2019), by which it renewed for 12 months the
authorizations for States and regional organizations
cooperating with Somalia to use all necessary means to
fight piracy off the coast of Somalia. While noting the
improvements in the country, the Council recognized
that piracy exacerbated instability in the country and
stressed the need for an international response to tackle
the underlying causes of the phenomenon. While piracy

States should pay serious attention to the problem and
continue coordinated counter-piracy efforts, including
through the Contact Group on Piracy off the Coast of
Somalia.

the conflict in Libya. They expressed particular concern
regarding reported breaches of the arms embargo, as
well as the growing involvement of mercenaries.
47. The Council continued to follow closely political
and security developments in Mali. The progress of the
peace process, in particular the implementation of the
Agreement on Peace and Reconciliation in Mali,
remained a major focus of the Council in 2019. In
March, the Council held a briefing at the ministerial
level on the United Nations Multidimensional

expressed its support for the use of life support
consumables provided by MINUSMA to the Force by all

African Union
54. The importance of close cooperation with the
African Union was a key theme of many Council
discussions on Africa in 2019, and especially during the
ministerial-level meeting on peace and security in
Africa held in September and the Council briefings in
October. During the latter, the Council considered the
annual report of the Secretary-General on strengthening

the Council welcomed the continued affirmation by the
Colombian parties of their continued commitment to the
peace process and the development of programmes with
a territorial focus and others that contributed to the
implementation of the Final Agreement for Ending the
Conflict and Building a Stable and Lasting Peace. It
stressed the urgency of further accelerating efforts to

Introduction

independence and autonomy of the Special Jurisdiction
for Peace. At every opportunity, the Council expressed
serious concern over insecurity in some of the conflictaffected areas of the country and the continued killings
of community and social leaders, including women, and
of former FARC-EP members. It called for those
responsible for those killings to be brought to justice.
57. In July, the Council conducted a mission to
Colombia, which allowed members to get first-hand
perceptions of the progress in the peace process from
various government, society and United Nations
stakeholders, as well as to reconfirm the Council’s full
support therefor.
58. The Council continued to support the United
Nations Verification Mission in Colombia and in
September it adopted resolution 2487 (2019), by which
it extended the mandate of the Mission for one year.
59. In Haiti, 2019 became the year of transition from
a peacekeeping presence into a special political mission:
BINUH was established by the Council in its resolution
2476 (2019), adopted on 25 June. The new Mission was
mandated to advise and assist the Government of Haiti
in assuming full responsibility for the situation in the
country in several key areas and, in its resolution 2476
(2019), the Council stressed the primary responsibility
of the Government of Haiti in those areas. In 2019, there

such as Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, also
known as Da’esh) and their affiliates, in particular
Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant-Khorasan, and other
terrorist groups, and foreign terrorist fighters, along
with brutal terrorist attacks in different parts of
Afghanistan, complicated the security situation. The
Council issued six statements to the press on terrorist
attacks in Afghanistan, in which it condemned the
cowardly terrorist attacks.
63. The Council focused on the peace reconciliation
process in Afghanistan. Council members flagged their
support for an Afghan-led and Afghan-owned inclusive

regional and international efforts and formats.
64. The Council issued a statement to the press on the
presidential elections that had been held in Afghanistan

women. The challenges to Afghanistan and the region
posed by illicit drugs and terrorism were also addressed,

their deep appreciation to the Government of
Bangladesh for its efforts to provide protection and
assistance to refugees and expressed their determination
to continue supporting Bangladesh. The members of the

bizonal, bicommunal federation with political equality,
as set out in the relevant Council resolutions, including

exercising maximum restraint and of the liaison function
of UNDOF to prevent escalation.

Part IV
Report of the Military Staff Committee
I. Introduction
1.
The present report of the Military Staff Committee covers the period f rom
1 January to 31 December 2019.

II. Background
2.
The Military Staff Committee was established in accordance with Article 47 of
the Charter of the United Nations and Security Council resolution 1 (1946). The
Committee has a mandate to advise and assist the Security Council on all questions
relating to the Council’s military requirements for the maintenance of international
peace and security, the employment and command of forces placed at its dispo sal, the
regulation of armaments, and possible disarmament.

III. Summary of the activities of the Committee
3.
The Committee functioned continuously under its revised draft statute and
revised draft rules of procedure, contained in document S/115 of 1 August 1946,
during the period under review. The Committee held a total of 27 meetings and
discussed a total of 42 topics. During the reporting period, the Committee had planned
to conduct two field missions to current United Nations peacekeeping operations.
4.
Military representatives of elected members of the Security Council participated
in 26 meetings. Representatives of Secretariat departments were invited to brief the
Committee and contributed to discussions: the Department of Peace Operations on
31 topics, the Department of Political and Peacebuilding Affairs on 8 topics and the
Department of Operational Support on 2 topics.
5.
Current United Nations peacekeeping and special political missions were the
focus of 27 meetings, and various thematic issues were discussed at 14 meetings (see
appendix IV.A).
6.
During the reporting period, the Committee planned and was prepared to conduct
two field missions to current United Nations peacekeeping operations but had to postpone
them owing to visa issues for the Committee members from the Russian delegation.
7.
The Committee continued to announce all meetings and provisional agendas in
the Journal of the United Nations and on its website (www.un.org/securitycouncil/
subsidiary/msc), which is available in the six official languages of the United Nations
and offers swift and easy access to the programme of work and current information
on the Committee.
8.
In accordance with paragraph 178 of General Assembly resolution 60/1 entitled
“2005 World Summit Outcome”, the Committee continued to co nsider its
composition, mandate and working methods.
9.
Military representatives of Equatorial Guinea and Kuwait have not yet been
appointed to the Committee.
10. The Committee amended some of its working methods, for example, military
representatives of the elected members began to take their seats at the start of meetings.
11. The Committee remained prepared to carry out the functions assigned to it under
the terms of Article 47 of the Charter.
