                                       Together, NATO Allies represent one billion people
                                   and roughly half of the world’s economic and military might.




             Why Was NATO Founded?
             The North Atlantic Treaty Organization was founded in 1949 in the aftermath of the Second World War. Its
             essential purpose is to safeguard the freedom and security of all its members by political and military means.
             The principle of collective defence is at the very heart of NATO’s founding document — the North Atlantic Treaty.
             This principle, enshrined in Article 5 of the Treaty, binds NATO Allies together, committing them to protect each
             other against attack. NATO strives to secure a lasting peace in Europe, based on common values of democracy,
             individual liberty and the rule of law.



             How Many Member States Are There?
             The Alliance started with 12 founding members: Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Iceland, Italy, Luxembourg,
             the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, the United Kingdom and the United States. The North Atlantic Treaty allows
             other European states to join the Alliance, as long as all existing Allies agree. Any prospective member must
             share NATO’s core values and have the capacity and willingness to contribute to security in the Euro-Atlantic
             area. Over the decades, the following 18 countries have joined NATO: Greece and Turkey (1952), Germany
             (1955), Spain (1982), the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland (1999), Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania,
             Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia (2004), Albania and Croatia (2009), Montenegro (2017) and North Macedonia
             (2020). All 30 NATO Allies are stronger and safer together than they would be alone.

     For All Who Serve

     Thank you!

     Thank you to the tens of thousands who served in 2021 from across Europe and
     North America in NATO military commands, exercises, missions and operations.
     Your service and sacrifice as soldiers, sailors, air force members and marines have
     helped keep the Alliance’s one billion people safe throughout this complex year. You
     are the strong backbone that supports NATO’s solidarity and our enduring values:
     democracy, individual liberty and the rule of law.

     For those who served in Afghanistan, an additional word of thanks is in order. Over
     the past 20 years, no terrorist attacks from Afghanistan have harmed our people or
     countries. We owe this to you. And we pay special tribute to all those who made the
     ultimate sacrifice for our freedom.

     In these uncertain times, we are reassured to know that you, the dedicated members
     of our armed forces, stand shoulder-to-shoulder to keep our nations safe.

     Once again, thank you.

                       To keep our people safe in today’s unpredictable world,
                   we must continue to strengthen and modernise our deterrence

                         robust, resilient societies; and a global perspective.

                Deterrence and Defence in the 21st Century. Brussels, Belgium, 13 December 2021.


NATO faces the most complex security environment
since the end of the Cold War. In response, the
Alliance has engaged in its biggest adaptation in a
generation — increasing investments, modernising
capabilities and investing in higher force readiness.

In 2021, Allies took further steps to ensure that the
right forces are in the right place at the right time,
including by continuing to invest in readiness and
in the Alliance’s rapid response capability. NATO                    Readiness is a key part of NATO’s

encompassing the national and multinational forces
available to NATO — to meet current and future
deterrence and defence needs.




       NATO’s Military Adaptation
       NATO has developed two high-level military concepts that establish the direction for NATO’s ongoing
       adaptation. The first one, the Concept for the Deterrence and Defence of the Euro-Atlantic Area, provides
       the Alliance with a framework to respond to major known threats. The concept supports proactive
       planning to tackle potential crises and conflict. It improves the organisation, command and control of
       Allied forces and capabilities. In short, it enhances NATO’s ability to respond to any contingency.

       The second concept, the NATO Warfighting Capstone Concept, sets a 20-year vision for NATO
       Allies to maintain military advantage. Based on current and emerging threats, it details the military
       instrument NATO needs to protect its one billion citizens, and sets a realistic path to achieve that goal
       through the Warfare Development Agenda. The concept enables NATO to preserve and strengthen
       its military and technological advantage even as the character of conflict evolves.

Deploying Forces, Enhancing
Readiness, Accelerating
Responsiveness
In 2021, NATO maintained its forward presence in the
eastern part of the Alliance. In the Baltic Sea region,
the Alliance continued to deploy four battalion-size
multinational and combat-ready battlegroups led
by the United Kingdom in Estonia; by Canada in
Latvia; by Germany in Lithuania; and by the United
States in Poland. The battlegroups — involving
thousands of troops from multiple NATO Allies —
conducted 15 joint training activities and exercises
in 2021. For example, in April, June and September,
exercise Ramstein Alloy engaged Estonia, Latvia,
Lithuania and partners Finland and Sweden in a
collective defence (Article 5) scenario to promote
interoperability and coordination, primarily in the
air domain. These exercises are key to sustaining
and developing readiness and interoperability
among Allied forces. NATO’s forward presence is
defensive, proportionate and fully in line with the
Alliance’s international commitments and its aim to
preserve peace and stability.

 In the Black Sea region, Allies contribute forces
 and capabilities to support a forward presence on
 land, at sea and in the air. In 2021, Allies stepped up
 cooperation in air training and air policing, increased
 the activities of NATO’s Standing Naval Forces
 and trained Allied land forces via the multinational
 framework brigade in Craiova, Romania. In July,
 maritime exercise Breeze 2021 brought together
 more than 2,000 forces and 30 ships from 12 NATO
 Allies — Albania, Belgium, Bulgaria, Greece, Italy,
 Latvia, Poland, Romania, Spain, Turkey, the United
 Kingdom and the United States — as well as NATO
 partners Georgia and Ukraine.

  Enablement: Enhancing NATO’s Mobility

  Every NATO deployment — whether to defend an Allied country or aid civilians in a crisis — entails mobilising
  and transporting troops, vehicles, equipment, supplies and fuel. Enabling effective military mobility for Allied
  countries — via land, sea and air — is critically important to improve NATO’s agility and its ability to rapidly
  deploy and sustain forces throughout the Alliance.

  NATO’s enablement work has been underway for some time, with its scope involving multiple governmental,
  civil and commercial dimensions. In 2021, Allies led efforts to further increase transport capabilities, enhance
  command and control, improve legislation and upgrade critical infrastructure in Europe. In addition, work
  continued on fuel supply and distribution arrangements. To advance these efforts, NATO continued working
  with the European Union in the area of military mobility.

Deterrence and Defence in the Air
NATO’s Integrated Air and Missile Defence is an
essential mission contributing to NATO’s overall
deterrence and defence. This mission safeguards
Alliance territory, populations and forces. It stands
ready to counter all air and missile threats emanating
from any direction.

     Safe Skies: 60 Years of NATO Air Policing

     Established 60 years ago, NATO’s Air Policing mission secures Alliance airspace in peacetime. It is also
     a tangible expression of Alliance solidarity. Allies that do not possess full air policing capabilities are
     protected by other Allies that do.

     In 2021, Hungary and Italy covered Slovenia’s airspace, while Greece and Italy protected Albania and
     Montenegro. NATO’s Air Policing mission has also supported NATO’s newest Ally, North Macedonia, whose
     airspace in 2021 was covered by Italy. Rotational deployments of air policing capabilities provided support
     to the Baltic States, Bulgaria, Iceland, Poland and Romania, while the Belgian and Dutch Air Forces secured
     Benelux2 airspace.

     Across Europe, NATO fighter jets are on duty around the clock, ready to scramble in case of suspicious
     or unannounced flights near the airspace of Allies. NATO fighter jets scrambled around 370 times across
     Europe in 2021, mostly to check aircraft flying unannounced near Allied air space. Roughly 80% of the
     missions, 290 in total, were in response to flights by Russian military aircraft. Most of the intercepts in 2021
     occurred in the Baltic region. Generally, intercepts occurred without incidents as NATO planes take off to
     identify the approaching aircraft and escort it out of the area. Very few intercepted flights entered Allied
     airspace.

  Resilience and COVID-19

  The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic continued to test the Alliance’s resilience.

  NATO helps Allies and partner nations in the fight against COVID-19 by providing support and assistance.
  Building on the lessons learned concerning the medium- to long-term implications of the pandemic in the
  field of civil preparedness and resilience, Allies revised the resilience baseline requirements in October
  2021 and added evaluation criteria for individual Allies to measure their level of preparedness to deal with
  future high-impact, transboundary crises of similar scale and complexity.

The consequence management exercise North Macedonia 2021 was co-organised by NATO’s Euro-Atlantic Disaster Response Coordination Centre
                        and the Crisis Management Centre of North Macedonia. Area of Ohrid and Struga, North Macedonia, September 2021.



Resilience and Disaster Relief: The Euro-Atlantic Disaster Response Coordination Centre

The Euro-Atlantic Disaster Response Coordination Centre is NATO’s principal civil emergency response
mechanism working with Allies and partners to respond to natural and human-caused disasters. It
functions as a clearing-house mechanism for the coordination of requests by affected nations and offers of
assistance. The Centre works closely with the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian
Affairs and with the European Union’s Emergency Response Coordination Centre, both in exercises and
real-life emergencies.

In 2021, the Centre continued to coordinate the Alliance’s COVID-19 response by reacting to 19 pandemic-
related requests for assistance and supported a request from North Macedonia to respond to wildfires in
August 2021.

Since the establishment of the Pandemic Response Trust Fund in 2020, 21 Allies and two partners have
made financial contributions of more than EUR 5 million and in-kind contributions of medical equipment
to the NATO stockpile, including ventilators from Hungary, Slovakia and the United States, disinfectant
detergents from Latvia and personal protective equipment from Germany and Poland.

Throughout 2021, the Centre implemented 24 Pandemic Response Trust Fund projects to support three
Allies and six partners. This assistance enhanced the resilience of the beneficiaries’ national health systems
during recurring waves of the pandemic, reducing the pressure in central hospitals and augmenting national
inventories with modern medical equipment to save the lives of infected patients.

The NATO stockpile, established in June 2020 at the NATO Support and Procurement Agency’s Southern
Operational Centre in Taranto, Italy, maintains a stock of rapidly deployable medical equipment and supplies.




 In summer 2021, Greece faced devastating wildfires, forcing thousands to evacuate and threating landscapes, natural resources and historical sites in
 the country. The Greek authorities requested the support of the NATO Support and Procurement Agency, which assisted the Hellenic Fire Brigade with
    helicopters, pilots, crewmembers and mechanics. Eight heavy-lift and 12 medium-lift helicopters with different capabilities were deployed to different

                    We must continue to invest in the capabilities to deter and defend ourselves
                  on land, in the air and at sea. But we must also be able to do so in cyberspace
                   and in outer space. Areas that will be of critical importance in future conflicts.

         The 2014 Defence Investment Pledge
         At the 2014 NATO Summit, Allies endorsed the Defence Investment Pledge. The pledge recognises
         that fair burden-sharing is the foundation of the Alliance. It calls for all Allies to meet the NATO-agreed
         guideline of spending 2% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) on defence by 2024. It also calls for Allies to
         spend at least 20% of annual defence expenditure on major new equipment, including related research
         and development, within the same time frame. Finally, the pledge commits Allies to ensuring that their
         land, air and maritime forces meet NATO-agreed guidelines for deployability, sustainability and other
         metrics, and that these forces can operate together effectively, including through the implementation of
         NATO standards and doctrines.

Doorstep statement by NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg at the opening of the NATO Summit in Brussels, Belgium. June 2021.

                    Engaging with tomorrow’s leaders, like you, is so valuable.
            Because you were born into this unpredictable world. You have the greatest
             stake in our security. And you must have your say in the future of NATO.
                                    NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg,

Citizens who understand and support NATO’s

 NATO’s Digital Communication Channels

 In 2021, NATO’s digital communication channels
 — including broadcast, social media and the

 Facebook were under the age of 35. Among the
 year’s innovations, a youth-initiated and youth-

NATO 2030: NATO-Private Sector Dialogues

Starting in late 2020 and continuing throughout
2021, a series of six virtual meetings brought
together NATO and over 100 leading private
sector stakeholders. They discussed: the future of
warfare; potential private sector contributions to
Alliance security; sustainable defence innovation
and climate change, geopolitical competition in the
information landscape; the ethical deployment and
governance of new technologies; and the security of
critical infrastructure and supply chains. Launched
by GLOBSEC, with NATO support, these dialogues
were held behind closed doors and looked into
deepening the involvement of the private sector
across the transatlantic sphere.

  #WeAreNATO Campaign

  An innovative online communications campaign, #WeAreNATO tells NATO’s story in a lively, colourful style.
  #WeAreNATO has become NATO’s primary vehicle for reaching young audiences, who tend to be less
  familiar with the Alliance. Allied nations and military entities use the framework to communicate about
  their work and introduce the people who perform that work — from soldiers to scientists, cyber experts
  to civilian emergency responders. Ten Allies have adopted the campaign: Bulgaria, Croatia, Canada, the
  Czech Republic, Montenegro, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Turkey and the United Kingdom.

  In spring 2021, a #WeAreNATO targeted and time-bound campaign was launched to increase awareness
  and support of the Alliance among 18-to-24-year-olds in France, Montenegro, Spain, the United Kingdom
  and the United States. This campaign focused on explaining NATO’s efforts to respond to the COVID-19
  pandemic, advance gender equality and protect the environment. It reached 18 million young people.

     Listening to Citizens: Continued Support for the Alliance in 2021
     In 2021, NATO commissioned surveys across all 30 Allies to understand their citizens’ perceptions of NATO and to
     monitor trends in comparison to 2020.4 The data for 2021 was collected between 12 November and 2 December.



     Support for NATO remains high
     As in 2020, most citizens would vote for their country to remain a member of NATO in a referendum (62%), with only
     11% stating they would vote for their country to leave the Alliance. The graph below shows responses to the question
     “If you could vote for or against your country’s membership in NATO, how would you vote?”.

          November 2020. In 2019 a survey of 28,752 adults was carried out by Populus. Interviews were conducted online, except for North Macedonia, Albania and Montenegro
          where a face-to-face methodology was used due to the limited penetration of online panels in these countries. In all countries polled online a sample of at least 1,000
          respondents per country was achieved. In face-to-face countries at least 500 individuals per country were interviewed. Quotas for gender, age and region were set and
          post-weighting was applied to ensure the samples for each country were representative of the adult population. Total results (across all Allies polled) were weighted to the
          population distribution of NATO. The surveys referenced are based on non-probability sampling, with an indicative margin of error of ± 3%.

           NATO is the most successful alliance in history mainly because of two things:

Addressing the Impact of Climate Change on Security
Climate change poses significant security
challenges for all NATO Allies. In 2021, Allies took
a major step towards making NATO the leading
international organisation when it comes to adapting
to the security implications of climate change.

At the Brussels Summit, Allies agreed a NATO
Climate Change and Security Action Plan to
mainstream climate considerations throughout
the Alliance. NATO Allies agreed to conduct
an annual climate change and security impact
assessment to study the impact of climate change
on NATO’s strategic environment and NATO’s
assets, installations, missions and operations.
They also agreed to incorporate climate change
considerations into NATO’s work on resilience, civil
preparedness, defence planning, capability delivery,
assets and installations, standards, innovation,
training, exercises and disaster response.                 NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg meets with United States

 Preparing for Disaster: Exercise North Macedonia 2021

 Disaster exercises with realistic scenarios enhance
 national and collective preparedness and resilience,
 improve interoperability between NATO and partner
 countries and provide a platform for innovation in
 disaster response. NATO’s Euro-Atlantic Disaster
 Response Coordination Centre contributes to this
 through the large-scale disaster response exercises
 it conducts — 19 of them so far — in Allied and
 partner countries. The most recent of these was
 North Macedonia 2021, which the Centre co-
 organised with the Crisis Management Centre of the
 Republic of North Macedonia.
 Incorporating both field training and table-top
 training components, the exercise presented the
 scenario of an earthquake in the areas of Ohrid
 and Struga, North Macedonia. Participants from
 27 countries and 15 international organisations
 worked shoulder-to-shoulder over a four-day period,
 20–23 September, through multiple crises drawn
 from previous real-life disaster incidents. These
 included mountain and urban search-and-rescue
 operations and responding to everything from floods
 to chemical, biological and radiological incidents to
 public misinformation campaigns.
 The exercise also provided the opportunity to                                Greek search-and-rescue responders prepare to jackhammer

 The lessons learned from previous disaster exercises have helped Allies and partners save lives, most recently
 during the forest fires and floods that hit Europe in the summer of 2021.

To keep its people safe and protect its fundamental
values — democracy, individual liberty and the rule
of law — NATO engages in operations and missions
beyond its borders, and cooperates with a range of
partner organisations and countries near and far.

Working closely together, NATO and its partners
can better uphold the rules-based international
order, defend common values and interests and
tackle global challenges, including terrorism.

     Countering Unmanned Aircraft in the Fight against Terrorism
     The misuse of small unmanned aircraft systems (often referred to as drones) represents a significant
     and growing risk to NATO operations and day-to-day defence activities. Today, these aircraft are a
     valuable tool and major element of asymmetric warfare. Their relatively low cost, flexible capabilities and
     potential lethality make them attractive to terrorist groups and non-state actors, who have incorporated
     their use as standard tactics to plan, prepare and execute attacks on forces, critical infrastructure and
     political figures.

     Countering the threat posed by unmanned aircraft requires a coherent and holistic approach. Through
     NATO, Allies continue to exchange information and learn from each other. In 2021, through the Defence
     Against Terrorism Programme of Work, NATO conducted a number of trials to assess technological
     developments regarding counter-unmanned aircraft systems, in particular:

     •	 Counter-Unmanned Aircraft Systems Innovation Challenge. Run by the NATO Communications
        and Information Agency in February and March 2021, the challenge tested academia, industry and
        research agencies’ use of the latest tracking, data fusion and machine learning techniques to detect,
        track and identify unmanned systems.

     •	 Summer Jamm 2021. With Germany taking the lead, this exercise tested the operational
        interoperability of counter-unmanned aircraft systems teams in civil-military operations, in particular
        in the protection of an airfield. Thirteen nations11 participated in the exercise in October 2021.

     •	 NATO Counter-Unmanned Aircraft Systems Technical Interoperability Exercise 2021. Led by
        the NATO Communications and Information Agency and conducted in November in the Netherlands,
        this exercise demonstrated interoperability between more than 70 systems and components
        deployed by 25 companies through standard protocols, allowing for plug-and-play integration and
        interface standardisation.

NATO Missions and Operations
NATO contributes to peace and security on the              capacity to undertake crisis management operations

and is committed to the peaceful resolution of             cooperation with other countries and international
disputes. When diplomatic efforts fail, NATO has the       organisations. 



NATO Mission in Afghanistan
Following the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the United
States, NATO Allies went into Afghanistan to
ensure that the country would not again become a
safe haven for international terrorists to attack the
homelands of NATO countries. Over the last two
decades, there have been no terrorist attacks on
Allied soil from Afghanistan.

From August 2003, NATO led the UN-mandated
International Security Assistance Force, which
aimed to create the conditions whereby the Afghan
government could exercise its authority throughout
the country and build the capacity of the Afghan
national security forces, including in the fight against
international terrorism. This UN-mandated force
was terminated in December 2014, when the Afghan
National Defence and Security Forces assumed
full responsibility for security across their country.                NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg participating

                                                           among all Allies, NATO announced the withdrawal

For NATO, the notion of human security directly
links Alliance values to NATO practice, focusing
on how to mitigate risks and threats to populations

agenda includes the protection of civilians, children

preventing and responding to conflict-related sexual
violence, and protecting cultural property.

Throughout 2021, NATO continued to hone its
approach to human security both through policy and

     Throughout 2021, the Alliance also continued
     to engage in dialogue with other relevant NATO partners in the region. They include international and
     regional organisations and other entities, such as the African Union, G5 Sahel, the European Union and
     the United Nations.




The Alliance has also developed active cooperation           “partners across the globe". They include Australia,

     Asia-Pacific Partners
     At the Brussels Summit in June 2021, NATO committed to enhancing political dialogue and practical
     cooperation with its long-standing Asia-Pacific partners — Australia, Japan, New Zealand and the
     Republic of Korea — to promote cooperative security and support the rules-based international order.

     NATO and these partners discuss common approaches to global security challenges where NATO’s
     interests are affected, share perspectives through political engagement and seek concrete areas for
     cooperation to address shared concerns. In 2021, NATO Allies and Asia-Pacific partners continued
     their political dialogue and practical cooperation on a range of issues, including in areas such as cyber
     defence, resilience, and science and technology. They were also actively engaged in NATO’s efforts in
     Afghanistan, either by sending troops or by contributing to the Afghan National Army Trust Fund.

       Relations with China
       NATO maintains a constructive dialogue with China with a view to defending the security interests of the
       Alliance.

       China’s stated ambitions and assertive behaviour present systemic challenges to the rules-based
       international order and to areas relevant to Alliance security. NATO is concerned about China’s rapidly
       expanding nuclear arsenal, publicly declared military-civil fusion strategy, opaque implementation of its
       military modernisation and military cooperation with Russia, including in Russian exercises in the Euro-
       Atlantic area.

       NATO believes China must uphold its international commitments and act responsibly in the international
       system, including in the space, cyberspace and maritime domains, in keeping with its role as a global power.

       In 2021, NATO continued to engage with China, including with a second meeting between NATO Secretary
       General Jens Stoltenberg and Minister of Foreign Affairs Wang Yi in September, and two rounds of high-
       level staff talks with Beijing, one of which was focused on arms control, disarmament and non-proliferation.
       In addition, Deputy Secretary General Mircea Geoană and China’s Ambassador to the European Union
       Zhang Ming have continued their regular meetings and have discussed a range of topics including
       Afghanistan, NATO 2030, NATO-Russia relations and climate change.

     Background: NATO’s Defence Capacity Building Initiative
     This initiative reinforces NATO’s commitment to partners and helps promote peace and stability by
     providing support to countries requesting assistance from NATO. Assistance ranges from strategic advice
     on defence and security sector reform and institution-building, to development of local forces through
     education and training, or advice and assistance in specialised areas such as logistics or cyber defence.

     The initiative was launched in September 2014 at the NATO Summit in Wales. It builds on NATO’s extensive
     track record and expertise in advising, assisting, training and mentoring countries that require defence
     and related security capacity building support. It uses NATO’s unique defence expertise to provide and
     coordinate practical specialised support. This support is offered to recipient nations in a package, which
     is demand-driven and tailored to the individual countries’ needs. Defence and Related Security Capacity
     Building Packages are implemented with the support of Allies and partners, who provide advisors, trainers
     and coordinators to work with recipient countries, and help fund projects. A dedicated Defence and
     Related Security Capacity Building Trust Fund has been in place since 2015, to provide financial support
     to the initiative. In 2021, good progress continued on the defence capacity building packages for Georgia,
     Iraq, Jordan, the Republic of Moldova, Tunisia and the United Nations.

  Seventy years ago, General Dwight D. Eisenhower addressed the North Atlantic Council with words that
  would change the path of education for NATO. His vision was to establish a NATO Defense College “for
  the training of individuals who will be needed to serve in key capacities in NATO Organizations”. After
  months of preparations, in November of that same year (1951), the first senior course was inaugurated.

  Since 1951, some 15,000 graduates, women and men, from over 80 countries have passed through the
  College’s classrooms and corridors.

  In 2021, the NATO Defense College celebrated its 70th anniversary. Over the years, the College
  has developed a reputation as a leading provider of world-class education on nearly every aspect of
  international security.

Cooperation with other International Organisations at a Glance
NATO is strongly committed to multilateralism
and close cooperation with other international
organisations. The Alliance engages with
the European Union, the United Nations, the
Organization for Security and Co-operation in
Europe and the African Union. It also maintains
regular dialogue with other organisations including
the World Bank and the International Committee of
the Red Cross.

Leaders at their Summit in June.


The African Union
The African Union is an important multilateral partner

In 2021, practical cooperation was heavily affected
by the COVID-19 pandemic, essentially meaning that

            NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, Women Political Leaders Summit. 21 June 2021.

leadership on the planning, execution and evaluation
of gender perspectives throughout all activities,
missions and operations. Additionally, NATO gender
advisors contribute to the enhanced integration of
gender components in exercises and drive efforts to
establish gender integration as a capability.

In parallel, focal points throughout NATO’s military
and civilian structures help inform new ways of
thinking about policies and programmes, and
guide the inclusion of gender perspectives in
their respective areas of work. In 2021, new focal
points were established at the NATO Support

  Life after Service: Is It Harder for Women?

  Recognising the disproportionate impact that conflict has on women and girls, and the vital roles women
  play in peace and security, NATO and its partners are committed to applying Women, Peace and Security
  principles to all that they do.

  One priority is advancing women’s participation and integration into military service, which includes
  supporting military women making the transition from active duty to civilian life. On 4 November 2021, with
  support from the NATO Science for Peace and Security Programme, Canadian, Ukrainian and US experts
  held an online advanced research workshop to support more successful reintegration of women soldiers
  into civilian life in Ukraine, a NATO partner country.

  Scientists, mental health professionals and policymakers, joined by former members of Ukraine’s Joint
  Force Operations who shared their experiences of returning to civilian life, assessed research that could
  best support women soldiers’ reintegration. Existing research, which focuses primarily on men in the military,
  shows that most soldiers reintegrate successfully into civilian life, yet some experience severe difficulties in
  developing a civilian identity, employment, finances, mental health or other life areas.

  To better understand how women soldiers experience reintegration, workshop participants discussed
  applying a gender lens to translate existing research. This fresh perspective will guide the development
  of effective policy and new research to support women in their military-to-civilian reintegration, which will
  benefit women not only in Ukraine but across the Alliance.

  COVID-19 Adjustments and Business Continuity

  In the COVID-19 context, the importance of business continuity cannot be overstated. Throughout the
  pandemic, NATO’s core programmes have been delivered by resilient staff members within adapted facilities
  using enhanced technology. Several NATO-wide business continuity tools were developed in 2021 and are
  available to practitioners. These include guidelines that provide tailored advice on implementing policy
  requirements, a maturity model that allows a structured assessment across NATO, and an awareness and
  competency framework that offers the building blocks for a business-continuity mindset in the organisational
  culture.

  In 2021, NATO Headquarters took consolidation measures in the conference areas to maximise NATO’s
  ability to meet in spite of the pandemic. Conference rooms were adapted, particularly ahead of the June
  Summit, and videoconferencing was both increased and diversified.

  The Business Continuity Office worked with multiple stakeholders to develop a robust business continuity
  management system, building on risk analysis, international standards and lessons from COVID-19. The
  business continuity capabilities and procedures were tested in a live exercise in December 2021.




NATO Military Authorities
In 2021, over 6,200 military personnel and 850
civilians worked collectively across the International
Military Staff and the headquarters of the NATO
Command Structure. Military personnel are
provided to NATO by the countries they serve
and are supported through their national defence
budgets. All 30 Allies are present within NATO’s
military structures.

The Military Committee is the senior military
authority within NATO. It is composed of the Chiefs
of Defence of NATO member countries and presided
by the Chair of the Military Committee, Admiral Rob
Bauer from the Royal Netherlands Navy (since June
2021). The Chair is NATO’s most senior military
officer. He is the principal military adviser to the
Secretary General and the conduit through which
consensus-based advice from NATO’s 30 Chiefs of
Defence is brought forward to the political decision-
making bodies of NATO.

The NATO Chiefs of Defence meet at least three
times a year as a group. On a day-to-day basis, the
Military Committee meets in permanent session with
military representatives who act on behalf of their
Chiefs of Defence. The role of the Military Committee

                                                        the best, if not the only, hope for peace in our time.” Churchill also told

Kosovo Force
The NATO-led KFOR mission is to contribute to maintaining a safe and secure environment and freedom of
movement for all communities in Kosovo, as mandated by the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244 of
1999. In carrying out its activities, NATO cooperates with and assists the United Nations, the European Union and
other international actors, as appropriate, to support the development of a stable and peaceful Kosovo. KFOR also
supports the development of professional, democratic and multi-ethnic security structures in Kosovo.

Defence Expenditure of NATO Countries (2014–2021)
NATO collects defence expenditure data from Allies and publishes it on a regular basis. Each Ally’s Ministry of
Defence reports current and estimated future defence expenditure according to an agreed definition. The amounts
represent payments by a national government that have been or will be made during the course of the fiscal year to
meet the needs of its armed forces, those of Allies or of the Alliance. In the figures and tables that follow, NATO also
uses economic and demographic information available from the Directorate-General for Economic and Financial
Affairs of the European Commission and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development.
In view of differences between these sources and national Gross Domestic Product forecasts, and also the definition
of NATO defence expenditure and national definitions, the figures shown in this report may considerably diverge
from those that are referenced by media, published by national authorities or given in national budgets. Equipment
expenditure includes expenditure on major equipment as well as on research and development devoted to major
equipment. Personnel expenditure includes pensions paid to retirees.
The cut-off date for information used in this report was 7 February 2022. Figures for 2021 are estimates.

Notes: Figures for 2021 are estimates.
*	 These Allies have national laws or political agreements which call for 2% of GDP to be spent on defence annually, consequently
   future estimates are expected to change accordingly. For past years Allies defence spending was based on the then available

Notes: Figures for 2021 are estimates. The NATO Europe and Canada and NATO Total aggregates from 2017 onwards
include Montenegro, which became an Ally on 5 June 2017, and from 2020 onwards include North Macedonia, which
became an Ally on 27 March 2020.
*	 These Allies have national laws or political agreements which call for 2% of GDP to be spent on defence annually,

140 consequently future estimates are expected to change accordingly. For past years Allies defence spending was based
    on the then available GDP data and Allies may, therefore, have met the 2% guideline when using those figures. (In 2018,
    Lithuania met 2% using November 2018 OECD figures).

           Notes: Figures for 2021 are estimates. The NATO Europe and Canada and NATO Total aggregates from 2017 onwards
           include Montenegro, which became an Ally on 5 June 2017, and from 2020 onwards include North Macedonia, which
           became an Ally on 27 March 2020.
           *	 These Allies have national laws and political agreements which call for 2% of GDP to be spent on defence annually,

                                                                                                                           141
               consequently estimates are expected to change accordingly. For the past years, Allies' defence spending was based on
               the then available GDP data and Allies may, therefore, have met the 2% guideline when using those figures (In 2018,
               Lithuania met 2% using November 2018 OECD figures).
