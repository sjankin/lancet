FOREWORD

The activities encapsulated within the Annual Report for 2020 are reflective of an extraordinary year,
in which IOM adapted and responded to the global COVID-19 pandemic.

The pandemic caused major disruption, including unprecedented restrictions to global mobility, and
left many millions of migrants and displaced populations in more vulnerable positions. During the year,
IOM implemented COVID-19-related operations in 140 countries to ensure that migrants, displaced
populations and communities had access to COVID-19-related services. The pressure on IOM staff to
respond, often in extremely difficult circumstances, was unrelenting.

My colleagues not only met the call to arms, but exceeded expectations, delivering a broad range of
COVID-19-related support while continuing to implement existing humanitarian and relief
programming, reaching over 37 million beneficiaries around the world without pause. When in-person
community-based programming was not possible, colleagues worked to devise innovative, remote
solutions. When new challenges arose, with migrants stranded across the world, colleagues deployed
support to ensure that those migrants were protected. This Report is a testament to their hard work
and commitment, and to the resilience of people on the move around the world.

While responding to the crisis, IOM also continued to invest in its own institutional development and
in the broader goals of the United Nations system. The Organization published a series of regional
strategies, contextualizing the priorities of the IOM Strategic Vision 2019–2023, and progressed with
the development of the Strategic Results Framework to effectively capture IOM’s actions to realize the
Vision and implement major international frameworks, such as the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly
and Regular Migration and the Sustainable Development Goals. The workplan of the Internal
Governance Framework was launched, setting out a programme for planned reforms.

In 2020, IOM became a member of the Core Group of the United Nations Sustainable Development
Group, and two thirds of IOM country offices reported that migration and mobility had been
included in United Nations common country analyses. IOM continued to build the United Nations
Network on Migration at regional and country level, and held coordinating roles in crisis responses
across 56 countries.

At the end of the year, IOM’s total combined revenue, comprising assessed contributions,
voluntary contributions and other income, increased by 3 per cent compared with 2019 and reached
USD 2,182.7 million. At the same time, the number of staff grew by 10 per cent.

As we emerge from 2020, I am all the more convinced of the urgent need to bolster IOM’s exceptional
capacity to deliver – amply demonstrated in this report – with core support to build the internal
governance, skills and systems that will sustain the Organization for the coming years, reinforcing its
position with Member States and within the United Nations system as a trusted partner and supporter
of migrants and displaced populations.

INTRODUCTION

1.      The year 2020 was exceptional by any measure. The activities and impacts outlined in this
report reflect the significant disruption that the COVID-19 pandemic has caused, not just for migrants
and displaced populations, but also for the Organization’s daily operations, in a context of reduced
global mobility and national lockdowns.

2.       Even before the official pandemic declaration by the WHO, IOM had rapidly repurposed
existing programmes and launched a global, multisectoral response to COVID-19. In close coordination
with governments, other United Nations agencies, the private sector, communities and implementing
partners, IOM quickly scaled up its activities to address the needs of migrants, displaced populations
and communities, anchoring the Organization’s response in its comprehensive understanding of
population mobility and its cross-sectoral expertise.

3.       The impacts on IOM beneficiary groups have been significant. Border closures and travel
restrictions have created new vulnerabilities for migrants and mobile populations in transit, many of
whom have found themselves stranded. Protection risks, such as gender-based violence, exploitation
by human smugglers and human trafficking, have increased during the pandemic, as cross-border
movements have been limited. At the same time, the COVID-19 pandemic has exposed our reliance on
migration and migrants for healthy and prosperous societies, with many migrants working on the front
lines of the pandemic response worldwide.

4.      Xenophobia and stigma against migrants on the basis of national origin or racial/ethnic identity
has worsened. Many migrants have found themselves with specific health vulnerabilities – due to the
harsh conditions in which they live and work, often without access to basic services – and have
experienced barriers to health-care access, whether due to a lack of information or financial resources,
or exclusion from social security systems. This structural inequality has been further compounded for
those in irregular situations, who may have feared reporting and reprisals if they were to access
support.

5.      The COVID-19 pandemic has stunted progress towards the achievement of the SDGs and
increased humanitarian needs, while exacerbating pre-existing vulnerabilities among migrants and
displaced populations and increasing the already complex barriers to durable solutions. Access to
populations in need has been hindered by mobility restrictions, while managing physical distancing has
proved challenging in densely populated environments – such as camps or camp-like settings – with
already overstretched health services and limited access to personal protective equipment and
sanitation.

6.        During 2020, IOM implemented COVID-19-related operations in 140 countries to ensure that
migrants, displaced populations and communities had access to COVID-19-related services. It is
difficult to fully reflect the comprehensive and intense nature of this response in this report while also
giving due attention to the broad range of regular activities which IOM continued to undertake
throughout the year. IOM’s COVID-19 Preparedness and Response Achievements Report 2020
describes the Organization’s response in greater detail, including regional-level interventions.

                            Key figures: IOM’s global COVID-19 response




In addition to an unprecedented on the ground response – which ranged from risk communication and
community engagement activities that reached over 37 million beneficiaries in 2020, to direct support
for the safe and dignified return of 2,677 stranded migrants – IOM contributed to United Nations crisis
coordination efforts, developed bespoke methods of data collection on mobility restrictions and
shared information on the critical impacts of COVID-19 on migrants and displaced populations.

IOM fostered strategic relationships to help facilitate the response, including with the Gavi Alliance
and the COVAX Facility, and signed memorandums of understanding with key stakeholders, including
the United Nations COVID-19 Response and Recovery Trust Fund. IOM sits on a number of critical
working groups and networks responsible for facilitating the response, including the First Line of
Defence (FLOD) and Vaccination Task Force and the United Nations System-wide Task Force on Medical
Evacuations in response to COVID-19, and is an active member of the United Nations COVID-19 Crisis
Management Team. Overall, IOM led or co-led 32 inter-agency coordination forums related to
COVID-19.

IOM created the COVID-19 Mobility Impacts Portal, a central global repository and dissemination
channel for information on flow monitoring, mobility tracking, border management and population
movements, to fully assess the pandemic’s impact on global mobility. The Portal is used by United
Nations agencies, Member States, NGO partners and the private sector.

IOM worked with health and border officials to build capacity for integrating health and hygiene at
points of entry, providing support to over 1,050 points of entry to undertake preparedness and
response measures, while advocating a more systematic approach to managing health risks at borders.
In addition, IOM supported 100 disease surveillance systems in 29 countries. IOM – for example
through statements of the United Nations Network on Migration – has consistently advocated a

                                                                                                 Page 3


migrant-inclusive response, including support for migrants stranded across the world and the inclusion
of migrants and displaced populations in vaccination programming.

Mindful of the deep socioeconomic impacts, which are still to be fully felt in many parts of the world,
IOM developed a toolkit on Integrating Migration into the Socio-economic Response to help
development partners ensure response plans are fully inclusive.

7.       It is also impossible to compare IOM’s regular programming with that reported in previous
Annual Reports, as several global programmes experienced significant challenges due to COVID-19.
Resettlement operations were postponed from March to June based on the operational risk and
viability of movement, though urgent resettlement for critical cases continued to take place. IOM’s
assisted voluntary return and reintegration operations were affected by border closures and the more
limited possibilities for in-person reintegration support.

8.       The IOM network of visa application centres was unable to assist migrants due to temporary
closures or reduced operations during parts of 2020. Many of the Organization’s routine pre-migration
health activities were temporarily suspended and service provision drastically decreased in the first
half of the year, although operations had recovered sufficiently by the end of the year to provide nearly
a quarter of a million health assessments worldwide.

9.      Nonetheless, IOM not only maintained but also adjusted its programming in response to the
evolving situation. IOM adapted the support it provided to take into account social distancing
requirements, while expanding into new forms of operational response, including providing support
for stranded migrants. Overall, the Organization’s operational reach increased. Innovative strategies
developed include the use of tools to provide information remotely, the provision of virtual
counselling and psychosocial support, remote interviews, increased use of cash and vouchers and
remote monitoring of programme activities.

10.     Indeed, demand for IOM’s operational support increased during 2020, and IOM’s staffing
increased by 10 per cent, with the total expenditure increasing by 4 per cent to USD 2,178 million
compared with 2019.

11.    While the impacts of the pandemic were an overriding preoccupation for most of 2020, IOM
continued to invest in its own institutional development. Notably, Member States adopted a major
reform of the Organization’s leadership structure, resulting in the creation of two Deputy Director
General positions, with dedicated portfolios.

12.     IOM’s nine regional offices published five-year strategies (2020–2024), contextualizing the
overarching priorities of the IOM Strategic Vision 2019–2023, and embedding a cycle of strategic
development at all levels of the Organization. In addition, the IOM Continental Strategy for Africa
2020–2024 was also published, which seeks to reinforce IOM’s commitment to safe, orderly and
regular migration within and outside the African continent. IOM also published its Migration Data
Strategy, setting out its ambitions to work both within and beyond the United Nations system to
produce coherent, high quality data to inform migration-related decision-making.

13.    Meanwhile, the Application of the Internal Governance Framework Work Plan (Internal
Governance Framework workplan) – which consolidated the different strands of work – was developed
and shared with Member States, setting out a road map for the planned reforms. With the successful
launch of the workplan, and the support of Member States, work to implement the Internal

Governance Framework accelerated towards the end of the year, including with respect to the
Business Transformation initiative. 1

14.    Overall, IOM’s work in 2020 reveals not only the resilience of the Organization and its staff to
pressure, but also its adaptability, even in the midst of a global crisis.

IOM OPERATIONS AND ACTIVITIES

Humanitarian response and resilience

15.     2020 was an unparalleled year for crisis response operations, with overlapping crises
continuing to unfold in a context in which the Organization faced significant practical challenges in
terms of its operating environment. There was an ongoing increase in displacement worldwide, with
new displacements seen in every region.

                                Total number of internally displaced persons




16.      There were 55 million internally displaced people across the world at the end of 2020,
48 million as a result of conflict and violence and 7 million as a result of disasters. 2 Over 26 million
refugees were recorded as of mid-2020. 3

17.     Protracted displacement situations are becoming the norm, during which populations often
depend upon humanitarian assistance. The crises in the Syrian Arab Republic and Yemen retained their
corporate Level 3 emergency designations throughout 2020, with Yemen considered to be the world’s
worst humanitarian crisis due to escalating conflict, disease and the decline in the economy and public
services. Conflict and instability, often manifesting as complex humanitarian crises, continued in a
number of countries, including Afghanistan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Libya. Two
outbreaks of Ebola virus disease were declared in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, further adding
to already acute and persistent humanitarian crises. In Mozambique, the rapidly escalating crisis in
Cabo Delgado Province triggered the displacement of 584,000 people in 2020, a more than seven-fold
increase on the figure for 2019, resulting in more than 669,000 people living in internal displacement
by the end of the year.

18.    Meanwhile, socioeconomic and political crises – for example, in the South America region –
led hundreds of thousands of people to forcibly migrate, resulting in mixed flows of refugees and
migrants. Protracted crises were compounded by slow-onset disasters, caused by climate change,

drought and socioeconomic instability, further exacerbating people’s vulnerabilities and eroding their
capacity for resilience, as evidenced in the Sahel region and Central America.

19.     In response, IOM continues to deploy its emergency preparedness and response operations to
address the multifaceted challenges posed by slow- and sudden-onset crises around the world,
including public health emergencies, as well as to support recovery from crises. In 2020 alone, IOM
had an operational reach of over 37 million beneficiaries. 4

                           Box 2. IOM global report on operations and emergencies

Each year, IOM produces a global report on operations and emergencies, 5 which provides a snapshot
of IOM’s crisis-related activities in the areas of emergency preparedness and response; transition and
recovery; and resettlement and movement management. The report is based on the inputs collected
through the Organization’s yearly reporting exercise, in which more than 100 country offices report on
direct or community-based assistance, technical support and capacity-building activities provided
during the previous year.

                                              IOM crisis-related support




IOM life-saving and crisis response

20.     IOM’s humanitarian work spans the crisis continuum in areas such as CCCM, displacement
tracking, shelter and settlements, health and WASH, while utilizing different modalities, such as cash-
based interventions. IOM provides technical expertise, operational support and policy guidance on
emergency preparedness, response planning and implementation, and ensures that responses on
relevant core humanitarian programming are coordinated at the country, regional and global levels.

21.     In 2020, IOM worked to strengthen its preparedness for and response to humanitarian crises
by developing thematic and cross-cutting guidance and supporting capacity-building for relevant
stakeholders. IOM produced a number of guidance notes, technical guidance documents, toolkits, and
training resources in the areas of WASH, shelter, cash-based interventions, CCCM, health, and
protection, including with regard to gender-based violence. Efforts were also made to harmonize and
strengthen the Organization’s approach and institutional policies related to mixed migration flows and
humanitarian hub management.


4   IOM crisis response data refer to people reached by services and assistance and/or whose lives are positively impacted
    by an IOM intervention. The large increase in the number of people reached in 2020 is partially attributable to the COVID-
    19-related programmes and activities implemented during the year.

22.      Through the DTM, IOM also collected, analysed, and disseminated data on population mobility
in 86 countries, tracking the movements of over 29.4 million IDPs, 20.8 million IDP returnees and
5.4 million returnees from abroad. These data collection efforts also prioritized cross-cutting issues,
such as the collection and analysis of data regarding disability inclusion in humanitarian operations in
several contexts and the integration of protection indicators into 88 per cent of operations.

23.      Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020, as a member of the IASC, IOM
has played a leading role in the global humanitarian response to the outbreak, including through the
fast-tracked development of a series of interim guidance notes that are available in different
languages. Field missions were supported in their adaptation and response to COVID-19, with a heavy
emphasis on preparedness and risk mitigation. IOM encouraged the use of the most suitable
modalities available to limit contact and allow for safer distribution of humanitarian assistance, such
as cash-based interventions.

24.     The IOM Global Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan for COVID-19 was developed to
guide the Organization’s response during the first year of the pandemic, covering 140 countries, with
an updated appeal for funding of USD 618 million. Within the framework of the Plan, IOM quickly and
effectively scaled up and provided vital assistance to communities and countries impacted by
COVID-19. Furthermore, IOM also managed a USD 25 million disbursement from the Central
Emergency Response Fund to support 26 front-line national and international NGOs engaging in life-
saving health and water and sanitation responses to COVID-19, expected to benefit 1.38 million
individuals in six countries by the end of the project.

25.      The Organization held a coordination role in 131 clusters, sectors, working groups and other
coordination forums in 56 countries, sometimes leading or co-leading multiple platforms at regional,
national and sub-national levels, such as in Bangladesh, Mozambique and South Sudan, as well as well
as for the response in support of refugees and migrants from the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela.
Those coordination forums have cumulatively supported 1,923 partners globally.

26.     In the context of its role as co-lead of the Global CCCM Cluster, IOM also leads the
development of coordinated emergency resource mobilization efforts and supports global and country
alignments within the humanitarian programme cycle while at the same time hosting several global
projects aimed at strengthening the role and capacity of IOM in the humanitarian sphere.

27.      In 2020, IOM further maintained and strengthened its commitment to several strategic global
coordination forums focusing on protection, including global and field protection work streams and
initiatives within the framework of the IASC and its Results Groups. Notably, IOM contributed to
briefings on discrimination and xenophobia as a core issue of concern with regards to protection,
making sure the plight of migrants was specifically highlighted, and to the development of key
protection advocacy messages related to COVID-19.

28.     In 2020, IOM was appointed, together with UNFPA, the co-chair of the International
Organization Working Group of the Call to Action on Protection from Gender-Based Violence in
Emergencies, a ground-breaking global initiative to fundamentally transform the way gender-based
violence is addressed in humanitarian action. The new role of IOM within the initiative offers a strategic
position for IOM to advance global and agency-wide commitments to ending gender-based violence in
emergencies and create tangible and lasting change at the field level through its vast operational
footprint. In December 2020, IOM further reaffirmed its commitment to the objectives of the Call to
Action by making institution-wide, specific, measurable commitments in accordance with the new
2021-2025 Road Map.

                                                                                           C/112/INF/1
                                                                                                Page 7


29.     IOM also contributed to several inter-agency data mechanisms in 2020, including the Global
Information Management, Assessment and Analysis Cell on COVID-19, the Humanitarian Data
Exchange (where DTM data from 24 countries are available), and the steering committee of the Expert
Group on Refugee and Internally Displaced Persons Statistics. IOM data were also frequently shared
with other humanitarian actors to inform their responses, with 80 per cent of humanitarian needs
overviews and humanitarian response plans fully or partially using DTM data for analysis on internal
displacement in 2020.

                              Box 3. Principles for humanitarian action

IOM is committed to principled humanitarian action. IOM’s emergency response is framed by the
Organization’s humanitarian policy (C/106/CRP/20) and is guided by humanitarian norms, principles,
and professional standards, including the four core humanitarian principles of humanity, impartiality,
neutrality and independence. In 2020, against the backdrop of escalating humanitarian needs due to
the COVID-19 pandemic, climate change, and conflict, IOM used these humanitarian principles in its
operational and strategic decision-making to navigate and respond to humanitarian crises despite
access constraints and the shrinking of the humanitarian space, and continued to assist and protect
the most vulnerable, for example, in Afghanistan and South Sudan.

Reflecting the strong commitment to principled partnerships, and recognizing the central role of a
collective response to the humanitarian consequences of the pandemic, IOM’s active engagement at
all levels within the IASC during 2020 contributed to the development of important new measures in
support of NGO partners, including increased funding flexibility and the establishment of minimum
standards for duty of care in the context of the pandemic. As part of a multi-annual capacity-
strengthening initiative, a total of 176 IOM staff earned one or more professional humanitarian
certifications with sector-wide recognition through the International Association of Professionals in
Humanitarian Assistance and Protection practice-based Credentialing Program, which promotes the
highest of professional standards.

In addition to ensuring that humanitarian norms and principles are mainstreamed into the
Organization’s institutional training programmes for staff, a training package on IOM’s institutional
humanitarian policy and humanitarian principles has been developed for IOM’s implementing
partners, with over 65 implementing partner employees from 22 local, national and international
NGOs already trained, contributing to a more effective joint response to crises and reflecting IOM’s
commitment to principled partnerships.

IOM collaborated with the Global Public Policy Institute on an initiative to better understand how the
Organization handles decisions related to principled access. The initiative produced recommendations
synthesizing insights and identifying opportunities for strengthening IOM’s ability to gain and maintain
principled humanitarian access.

30.      The Accountability to Affected Populations Framework was revised in 2020. It helps the
Organization to ensure quality and responsive programming that responds to the evolving needs of
beneficiaries, affected populations and communities and to enforce zero tolerance for sexual
exploitation and abuse and other misconduct. In implementing the Framework, IOM reinforced staff
capacity across the Organization through global webinars that reached offices in 74 countries. IOM
piloted a blended AAP training course in the Middle East and North Africa and West and Central Africa
regions.

31.     As of 2020, 69 IOM offices had mechanisms or tools in place to systematically monitor and
analyse feedback and complaints from beneficiary and affected populations, and 56 offices had written
standard operating procedures in place for handling or referring complaints. Forty-seven offices had
-----------------------Page 15 End-----------------------

C/112/INF/1
Page 8


also integrated AAP into their country plans and strategies and 35 offices had an AAP focal point
participating in inter-agency AAP activities. The integration of AAP into humanitarian programming is
well demonstrated in two out of three crisis responses with Level 3 designation, namely in Yemen and
Turkey (for the Whole-of-Syria response).

32.     IOM’s humanitarian portfolio in Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh, for instance, systematically and
continuously received and addressed feedback from refugee beneficiaries in the camps through a
network of feedback and information centres. In response to feedback from beneficiaries, IOM
introduced over-the-phone psychosocial counselling during the COVID-19 lockdown, when face-to-
face counselling was not possible. In Turkey, in the context of a project on strengthening and
supporting small and medium-sized enterprises, IOM used community feedback assistants for direct
communication and consultation with beneficiaries, which resulted in new modules on mitigating the
negative impact of COVID-19 on small and medium-sized enterprises and their business cycles.

33.      In Bosnia and Herzegovina, direct feedback from beneficiaries led to improvements in IOM-
managed reception centres, such as establishing prayer rooms and facilities for cultural, sports and
educational activities; adapting food to cultural practices; and improving access to services for women
and persons with disabilities. IOM used similar AAP approaches (focusing on focus group discussions,
interviews, beneficiary feedback, etc.) to improve cash-for-materials or cash-for-shelter programming
in Yemen; comprehensive information and orientation programmes in the United Arab Emirates;
shelter and CCCM programming in Mozambique; and nutritional support, food distribution and cultural
orientation in Jordan.

34.     In 2020, IOM’s roster of experts, a repository of vetted experts who possess the skill sets
needed for the Organization’s various sectors of emergency response, contained a total of 583 active
experts who had vetted skills. During the reporting period, a total of 148 staff deployments took place
(59 internal, 89 through standby partners).

35.      IOM also utilized its hubs of pre-positioned NFI stocks 26 times (19 times from the warehouse
in Nairobi, 6 times from the warehouse in Manila, and once from the warehouse in Panama) during
2020 to respond in a more timely manner to emerging crises. Eighteen long-term agreements were in
place for the replenishment of global stocks and for transport and freight forwarding services. To date,
four IOM quality control centres are fully operational (Manila, Nairobi, Gaziantep, Juba). These centres
are in strategic locations and respond to the increasing demands for quality inspections of NFIs and
other essential household items from the IOM field missions. Fifty per cent of field missions followed
quality management procedures on establishment of long-term agreements for NFIs and their
supply/delivery.

                 Box 4. Protection from and response to sexual exploitation, abuse
                                         and harassment

In late 2020, IOM appointed a Senior Coordinator for the Prevention of Sexual Exploitation and Abuse
and Sexual Harassment within the Office of the Director General to lead IOM’s strategic and
coordinated approach on this issue and to strengthen IOM’s response globally and within the United
Nations system.

By the end of the year, 69 IOM offices were part of an inter-agency in-country PSEA network or task
force compared with 60 offices in 2019 and 48 in 2018. IOM co-chairs the network in eight of these
countries. For the Whole-of-Syria response, IOM is also funding the PSEA Coordinator position and six
IOM staff members to lead the PSEA network. Eighty per cent of the IOM offices with a PSEA network
reported that they have agreed upon terms of reference and 70 per cent have an action plan in place
to implement joint PSEA activities.
-----------------------Page 16 End-----------------------

                                                                                             C/112/INF/1
                                                                                                  Page 9


During the reporting period, 102 offices conducted PSEA training for 5,765 IOM staff, more than
60 per cent of whom took the training course for the first time. Furthermore, 34 offices also conducted
PSEA training for a total of 5,052 external actors comprising implementing partners, service providers,
government partners, etc. IOM Headquarters also organized and delivered an in-person PSEA training
for the UNCT in Ukraine. In response to COVID-19, IOM’s PSEA in-person training package was adapted
for online delivery. This allowed 2,249 staff from 227 offices across 130 countries to be trained via
highly interactive, multilingual webinars.

As of December 2020, 33 offices had an inter-agency referral system for handling complaints of sexual
exploitation and abuse and providing victim support and assistance, while 36 offices reported that the
development of such a system was underway. Thirty-one of the 33 offices reported that the referral
system included a process for referring sexual exploitation and abuse survivors to victim assistance
services and contact points (psychosocial, medical, etc.) within the country.

In 2020, with the support of UNHCR, WFP and other IASC members, IOM was instrumental in the
adaptation of its internal PSEA training package to create an inter-agency training course, Saying No to
Sexual Misconduct, an innovative multilingual learning package to raise awareness amongst IASC
partner staff on the prevention of sexual exploitation and abuse and sexual harassment and ensure
that staff and partners have the necessary skills and tools to define, detect and respond to sexual
misconduct in the field. Additionally, as part of its inter-agency PSEA commitments, IOM trained
23 PSEA coordinators in 2020 for deployment to support in-country PSEA collective responses, bringing
the total number of coordinators trained to 48. To reach a wider audience than those selected to
participate in the annual training, IOM also launched a deployment package for PSEA coordinators.

IOM’s PSEA team responded to over 60 requests for PSEA-related in-country support through targeted
guidance and tools. As a result of its ongoing inter-agency PSEA support, IOM published the Frequently
Asked Questions on inter-agency PSEA: IOM’s lessons learned from PSEA implementation in-country.

Addressing the drivers of displacement and mobility and promoting peace

36.      Conflict, instability and environmental shocks and stressors continue to result in record
numbers of people on the move. IOM supports States and populations to prevent displacement and
other migration crises and to develop solutions for recovery and resilience. In 2020, IOM strengthened
its operations with medium- and long-term objectives focused on peacebuilding, resilience, recovery,
durable solutions and transitional and restitutive justice, confirming adherence with the OECD/DAC
Recommendation on the Humanitarian–Development–Peace Nexus. IOM’s programming applies
development-principled, and conflict- and gender-sensitive approaches in fragile and crisis contexts
working across the humanitarian, development and peace nexus. Increasingly, IOM’s regional and
country offices are also adopting a humanitarian, development and peace nexus approach regarding
joint assessments, strengthening evidence-based programming and fostering collaboration through
joint programme design, implementation and monitoring as part of the overall United Nations reform.

37.      Facilitated by IOM’s dedicated work streams focused on the prevention of and solutions to
displacement in fragile and crisis settings, efforts to enhance resilience, social cohesion and sustainable
recovery increased in 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. During the reporting period, IOM
implemented 343 transition and recovery projects in more than 90 countries, reaching 13,867,256
direct and indirect beneficiaries with activities in the following thematic areas: community
stabilization; durable solutions; peacebuilding and peace preservation; disaster risk reduction;
disarmament, demobilization and reintegration; preventing violent extremism; restoring housing, land
and property rights; reparations and humanitarian support to victims of human rights violations; and
elections support.
-----------------------Page 17 End-----------------------

C/112/INF/1
Page 10


38.     IOM continued to support a diverse peacebuilding portfolio designed to prevent, manage and
resolve conflict. For example, IOM engaged in capacity-building and livelihoods skills training for
members of the Bangsamoro Islamic Women Auxiliary Brigade to create conditions for social and
economic empowerment as part of efforts to advance gender equality and increase women’s
participation in socioeconomic and political affairs in the Philippines.

39.     In 2020, IOM worked to establish foundations for durable solutions for IDPs, through return,
relocation and local integration, in accordance with relevant frameworks, particularly the IASC
Framework on Durable Solutions for Internally Displaced Persons and the IOM Progressive Resolution
of Displacement Situations Framework. Over 180 active community stabilization and durable solutions
projects were implemented in 65 countries and regions, focusing on social cohesion and community
involvement, using IOM’s community stabilization approach. IOM also undertook capacity-building to
promote national and local authorities’ ownership of durable solutions processes and developed
thematic publications throughout 2020 that contributed to these efforts, as well as to the High-Level
Panel on Internal Displacement.

40.     Following this approach, and with support from the World Bank, in 2020, IOM launched a
programme in South Sudan intended to restore social cohesion, build capacities for peaceful co-
existence and initiate community-driven recovery in areas affected by conflict and displacement. The
programme, implemented in partnership with the United Nations Office for Project Services, utilized
IOM’s community-based planning methodology, which is designed to empower communities to
define, own and drive their own recovery processes.

        Livelihood services provided to migrants, refugees and internally displaced persons




41.      Many IOM missions supported livelihood assistance and economic revitalization, which seeks
to integrate individual support with community and local level initiatives to build capacity and address
identified barriers, and which benefitted more than 1 million people in 2020, through a variety of
interventions.

42.      IOM recognizes that addressing transitional and restitutive justice needs are necessary for
preventing forced migration and obtaining durable solutions to displacement following gross human
rights violations. In this area of work, IOM supported government-led reparations mechanisms and
mechanisms for the restoration of housing, land and property, as well as providing humanitarian
-----------------------Page 18 End-----------------------

                                                                                            C/112/INF/1
                                                                                                Page 11


support for the most vulnerable victims. For example, IOM has been extending technical support to
the Government of Iraq to strengthen a new law that will compensate Yazidis and other minority
groups that suffered human right violations during the ISIS conflict. The landmark decision taken by
the Government of Iraq to promote support to affected and vulnerable segments of the population
reflects this technical support rendered by IOM.

43.     In addition to conflict and instability, climate change and environmental degradation are also
profoundly shifting contemporary migration patterns. IOM seeks to reduce risk and build resilience to
disasters and promote stronger coherence between policies and practices related to migration, the
environment and climate change through the integration of migration considerations in climate
change, environmental, sustainable development and disaster risk reduction policies and strategies,
and the inclusion of environmental and climate change concerns in migration policies.

44.      In 2020, 87 offices were engaged in migration, environment, and climate change
programming, through the organization of and/or participation in national and regional policy
dialogues and events, awareness-raising initiatives, research and data collection and capacity-building
activities, influencing key policy processes related to environmental migration and the development
of policies on environmental migration.

45.      IOM also worked in crisis and post-crisis environments to prevent or reduce displacement
associated with disaster and climate risk, and to strengthen resilience by incorporating “build-back-
better” measures in recovery and reconstruction. As an example, in 2020, IOM joined forces with
Oxfam to launch a disaster risk reduction project in Burundi, which was backed by the European Union.
In the framework of this project, IOM facilitated the performance of provincial multi-hazard disaster
risk assessments, including in five especially vulnerable provinces. The information generated through
this assessment, conducted in coordination with the Government of Burundi, is now informing
planning, decision-making and prioritization of investments and activities to strengthen the resilience
of the most vulnerable communities to future and existing disaster and climate risks.

46.     During the reporting period, the Organization built the capacity of a total of 3,305 individuals,
including national and local government officials, community leaders, CSO and NGO staff and private
sector officials, in relation to migration, environment, and climate change and/or environmentally
sustainable practices. For instance, IOM cooperated with the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States,
the Caribbean Community Implementation Agency for Crime and Security, the Platform on Disaster
Displacement, UNHCR and the German Agency for International Cooperation in June 2020 to build the
capacities of the staff from over 100 border agencies in the Eastern Caribbean region in the
management of cross-border displacement situations.

47.      Together with the Platform on Disaster Displacement and the Internal Displacement
Monitoring Centre, IOM organized a virtual marketplace in November 2020, bringing together a broad
range of stakeholders to share data and evidence on human mobility in the context of disasters,
climate change and environmental degradation. In December 2020, IOM also organized the EU–IOM
Strategic Cooperation Expert Meeting on Migration and Displacement related to Disasters and Climate
Change, which informed the European Union’s consultations on displacement in the context of climate
change. Moreover, IOM played a coordinating role in the action group dedicated to migration of the
Ninth World Water Forum, which will take place in 2022, supporting the preparatory work of designing
priority actions.

48.    In Burkina Faso, two municipalities mainstreamed migration, environment and climate change
considerations into their local development plans, supported by guidance tools and training courses
provided by IOM. In Ethiopia, as a result of a community project implementing soil and water
conservation activities, farming productivity has been enhanced and the livelihoods of participating
-----------------------Page 19 End-----------------------

C/112/INF/1
Page 12


host community members have been improved, while also better protecting the local environment,
for example by addressing soil erosion. This project formed part of a joint initiative between IOM and
the European Union.

49.     In Somalia, IOM partnered with the United Nations Environment Programme to study
sustainable solutions to support rural–urban climate migrants, providing the Government and
implementing partners with policy and practice recommendations. Similarly, in Guinea, IOM
developed the first study on connections between human mobility, environmental degradation and
climate change in the country, with an emphasis on women and youth. The study created awareness,
strengthened the capacity of authorities and policymakers at the local, regional and national levels,
and provided a set of policy recommendations to improve the livelihoods of the most vulnerable
communities facing climate change.

50.     In Peru and Belize, IOM is supporting efforts to mainstream human mobility into climate
instruments and strategies. In Nicaragua, in February 2020, IOM organized the first national workshops
with the Government, civil society and international agencies to address the migration, environment
and climate change nexus in the country. At the regional level, IOM supported the Argentinian
Chairmanship of the South American Migration Conference in the establishment of a working group
devoted to advancing action on migration and the environment.

51.     In the Pacific region, under the IOM-led, multi-agency, multi-country Pacific Climate Change
Migration and Human Security Programme, a regional policy dialogue was organized virtually by the
United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific and IOM, bringing together
over 30 officials from 13 countries and resulting in the identification of gaps and opportunities to
strengthen protection of Pacific communities most prone to the impacts of the climate change.
Complementing the Programme, IOM is also implementing the multi-country Pacific Response to
Disaster Displacement project in collaboration with the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre and
the Platform for Disaster Displacement. Under the project, IOM has strengthened the capacity of and
enabled the Governments of the Marshall Islands, Solomon Islands, Tonga and Vanuatu to identify
communities at risk of displacement and forced migration and provide assistance and protection.

52.     In the East and Horn of Africa, IOM worked closely with the Intergovernmental Authority on
Development on the development of the Protocol on Transhumance Implementation Road Map
Period: 2021–2023, to protect the migration corridors used by pastoralists, which have been impacted
by climate change and environmental degradation.

Cohesive societies for community resilience and sustainable development

53.     The global pandemic highlighted the importance of focusing on migrants’ rights and inclusion
while mobilizing action against common threats and developing joint solutions. IOM worked with
partners from the United Nations and beyond to ensure that migrant and displaced population groups
were included in responses to the pandemic at global, regional and country levels. The societal and
economic disruptions exposed the particular vulnerabilities of migrants that have irregular status, that
are in informal employment or that are insufficiently integrated into receiving communities,
particularly the risk of increased inequalities and exclusion. At the same time, transnational
communities demonstrated their resilience and solidarity by mobilizing additional resources and
support for those left behind or with particularly dire needs.

54.     IOM’s work to promote migrant inclusion took many shapes in 2020, ranging from directly
providing integration and cultural mediation services to facilitating access to services, establishing
municipal peer-to-peer learning networks across countries and regions, and providing capacity-
building support for implementation of national integration plans. Many interventions continued
-----------------------Page 20 End-----------------------

                                                                                             C/112/INF/1
                                                                                                 Page 13


despite COVID-19-related restrictions. A significant proportion of IOM missions (40%) reported
applying digital solutions to their work, especially in migrant integration counselling and pre- and post-
arrival orientation.

55.      The IOM Office in Greece developed e-learning courses which featured 360 hours of
integration material, such as the Greek language and soft skills. These resources supported migrants
in their efforts to integrate into Greek society and constituted an important step towards building
migrants’ digital literacy and equitable access to digitalized public services. The IOM Office in Indonesia
conducted online training for public school teachers, in collaboration with UNICEF and other local
NGOs, to support long-distance learning for schoolchildren, migrants and refugees. Within the
framework of the Joint Global Initiative on Diversity, Inclusion and Social Cohesion (DISC), the IOM
Office in the United Kingdom collaborated with the United Kingdom Home Office in piloting their
Indicators of Integration Framework. This included the roll-out of a series of training courses in
collaboration with local authorities, statutory partners and civil society organizations engaged in local
planning and resulted in the development of the Guide for Practitioners on the Home Office Indicators
of Integration Framework.

56.     IOM also continued working with governments and partners on creating enabling conditions
for diaspora communities to help respond to COVID-19 crisis, tapping into opportunities from
increased transnational connectivity and networking. Building on the innovative IDiaspora.org
platform, which unites diasporas all over the world, IOM highlighted examples of diaspora response to
the COVID-19 pandemic, culminating in the launch of the Global Diaspora Confederation. With support
from the United States Agency for International Development Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance,
IOM also initiated work on the development of a global framework for diaspora engagement in
humanitarian assistance. Supported by these efforts, in 2020, diasporas assisted stranded migrants to
return to Ethiopia and Tajikistan, and shared professional expertise in medicine to support the COVID-
19 response in their communities of origin in Armenia and Mauritania.

57.     In areas related to financial inclusion and socioeconomic empowerment, IOM developed and
implemented the international community's socioeconomic response to COVID-19, focusing on
remittances. As a founding partner of a joint call to action launched by Switzerland and the United
Kingdom, entitled Remittances in Crisis: How to Keep them Flowing, and a member of the Remittance
Community Task Force, established by the International Fund for Agricultural Development, IOM
helped to formulate immediate and medium-term responses for governments, businesses,
intergovernmental organizations and NGOs to mitigate the impacts of the drop in remittances to
migrant communities during the pandemic. Stepping up its global advocacy within United Nations – in
addition to coordinating development of policy guidelines on remittances by the United Nations
Network on Migration – IOM contributed to discussions within the Financing for Development in the
Era of COVID-19 and Beyond Initiative and helped establish policy options relating to remittances and
diaspora investments, which were used in IOM activities in Azerbaijan, Indonesia, Serbia and
Zimbabwe.

58.      In addition to joining global efforts on keeping remittances flowing during the crisis, IOM
stepped up its advocacy for a broader understanding of migrants’ contributions to development. In
collaboration with the expert community, an innovative approach to measuring migrants’ economic
contributions to development was elaborated in guidance entitled Contributions and Counting:
Guidance on Measuring the Economic Impact of your Diaspora beyond Remittances. For the first time
ever, the report of the United Nations Secretary General on Entrepreneurship for Sustainable
Development recognized migrants and refugees as important participants in private sector
development, enterprise development and entrepreneurship, reflecting the work of IOM’s country
offices.
-----------------------Page 21 End-----------------------

C/112/INF/1

59.      In March 2020, IOM also partnered with the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development on the organization of a joint virtual workshop for members of the MDB Platform on
Economic Migration and Forced Displacement. During the workshop, several practical solutions for
mainstreaming the financial and skills contributions of migrants and refugees into the Platform’s work
with clients and technical cooperation with governments were developed, including programmes on
entrepreneurship, financial products and skills.

60.      Furthermore, IOM intensified its efforts to promote social cohesion through combating
xenophobia and hate speech in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, by promoting migrant-inclusive
digital solutions, social mixing activities, media campaigns, and developing a range of strategic and
policy recommendations and guidance materials on social inclusion and countering xenophobia.

                            Box 5. IOM’s contribution to sustainable development

With the roll-out of the IOM Institutional Strategy on Migration and Sustainable Development, IOM
made significant progress throughout 2020 in ensuring a coherent institutional approach to advancing
its contribution to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. IOM has now joined the United
Nations Sustainable Development Core Group, which demonstrates the recognition of the key
relevance of migration to achieving the SDGs and the role of IOM in supporting States’ efforts to do
so, in partnership with the United Nations system. IOM has also developed an internal action plan to
track its commitments in the United Nations Development system.

The strong IOM support to Member States around the 2030 Agenda at global, regional and
country level, including through its work with the United Nations Network on Migration, is visible
throughout this report. Of 165 offices, 129 (78%) reported increased efforts in this area and
91 offices (55%) worked to ensure policy coherence in migration and sustainable development.

A detailed report on the achievements made through the Institutional Strategy in 2020 can

61.      Providing reintegration support, including post-arrival reintegration assistance, to migrants
returning to their country of origin is an essential component of the Organization’s approach to return
migration, both for returns operated by IOM and those operated by other stakeholders. Through its
integrated approach to reintegration, IOM promotes sustainable reintegration through a multi-
dimensional approach that considers the economic, social, and psychosocial elements of reintegration
across the individual, community and structural levels. One key pillar of IOM’s approach to
reintegration relies on monitoring, evaluation and learning through comprehensive and standardized
tools to measure sustainable reintegration.

62.      In 2020, more than 120 IOM offices were involved in reintegration-related activities either in
the host country prior to return or upon arrival in the country of origin. In total, 106,230 reintegration
services 6 were provided to returnees either before departure (10%) or after arrival (90%). These
services, which include counselling, and economic, social or psychosocial assistance, were provided at
the individual, collective and community levels. Ninety-four per cent of services were provided by IOM,
while the remaining 6 per cent were provided through referrals. In 2020, reintegration services were
delivered to migrants whose return was organized by IOM (93%) or by other actors, such as




6   It should be noted that migrants can receive several services (e.g. counselling and economic assistance).

governments or NGOs (7%). Of the latter, 1 per cent were considered by these actors to be forced and
6 per cent were considered to be voluntary. 7

63.      To overcome the challenges posed by the pandemic, including disruption to post-arrival
counselling and reintegration assistance due to remote work modalities, businesses being closed,
social and medical services being stretched, etc., IOM adopted innovative solutions. For instance,
reintegration counselling was increasingly provided virtually to migrants in most countries. In some
countries, psychosocial support to returnees and medical screenings were also organized through
video calls (telemedicine). IOM also provided individualized virtual follow-up on business plans,
together with training courses, cultural orientation activities and peer networking opportunities, while
existing communication platforms were used as platforms for online job training.

64.      In the Plurinational State of Bolivia, Sierra Leone, Sri Lanka and Togo, IOM’s work has also
facilitated the development of small enterprises by returnees. Beneficiaries were trained on how to
establish and manage micro-businesses successfully. This support contributed to the economic
reintegration of returnees, allowing them to improve their living conditions in the medium and long
term.

                                   Box 6. Gender equality and mainstreaming

During 2020, the Organization continued its efforts to promote gender equality and gender
mainstreaming globally. In the field, 159 IOM offices reported that at least one aspect of gender
equality was the overall focus of engagement over the long term. In addition to implementing
measures to eradicate forced labour, modern slavery and human trafficking, and to protect the rights
of migrant workers (all of which demand particular attention to gender considerations), the most
reported gender-related engagement by IOM offices was to eliminate all forms of violence against
women and girls, as reported by 83 offices, followed by contributing to achieving decent work and
equal pay for work of equal value (reported by 74 offices) and ensuring women’s full and effective
participation (reported by 70 offices).

Gender considerations were integrated into several IOM responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. In
Cambodia, in response to the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on women (job losses in industries
where women workers are dominant), IOM has focused on supporting women through socioeconomic
recovery projects. Similar efforts were made in the Gambia, Thailand and Uruguay, with projects in
Uruguay also addressing the extra burden of childcare, which often fell to women, making it even more
difficult for them to access the labour market. In Algeria and Ireland, attention was focused on
addressing the increase in incidents of gender-based violence during the pandemic, while in Kosovo, 8
the mission focused on ensuring equal gender representation in socioeconomic activities, including a
push to include more women and girls in outreach activities about technology.

Activities to raise the awareness of men on gender equality topics have also been key. In India, for
example, as part of the CREST project, aimed at strengthening the capacity of the fashion industry to
address the risks of labour exploitation, forced labour and human trafficking in Asia, efforts were made
to raise awareness of gender issues among male counterparts during coordination meetings, thereby
contributing to protecting the rights of women workers. In Nicaragua, awareness-raising activities
were conducted for men on issues such as respect for women, domestic work and sharing child-care
responsibilities, to enable women with children to participate more in project activities. And in

7   IOM strongly believes that voluntary return should be promoted over forced return, as it gives migrants a choice and
    allows them to prepare for their return, thus positively impacting their reintegration process. However, IOM also assists
    migrants forcibly returned by governments, for whom reintegration assistance is equally necessary to rebuild a life once
    back in their countries of origin.

South Sudan, the mission engaged male role models that support women’s rights to challenge gender
stereotypes and inequalities.

Several IOM offices also reported challenging gender stereotypes in their activities by encouraging
women to participate in activities, forums and industries that are usually dominated by men, such as
border policing (in the Republic of Moldova), community development activities (in rural communities,
including indigenous villages, in Dominica), committees on migration management and cross-border
forums (in Namibia) and entrepreneurship and business development activities (in the Niger). In
Afghanistan, the Return of Qualified Afghans programme places and supports women in professional
settings in which men are typically dominant, and in Lesotho, women beneficiaries are encouraged to
develop new skills.

More than 60 offices reported having included specific activities related to gender equality in their
immigration and border management programming during the reporting period. In Cameroon, for
example, where most border officials are male, an analysis conducted on the gender dimensions of
health and border management during the project conceptualization phase identified the specific
needs and concerns of female travellers crossing borders that needed to be addressed. Additional
sensitivity training was mainstreamed into a series of capacity-building sessions delivered by that
particular project, including a training session conducted in the East region specifically on the
psychosocial elements of COVID-19 and border management.

Mobility

65.     Over the past year, the rapidly evolving pandemic has translated into a dynamic mobility
context. Due to unprecedented numbers of stringent COVID-19-related travel measures, global
mobility and migration have been adversely affected by the global pandemic. IOM created the
COVID-19 Mobility Impacts Portal as a central source of data on global impact of COVID-19 on mobility
in order to inform responses at all levels. This resource has responded to an unprecedented need for
global-scale data collection and coordination.

66.     As of 29 December 2020, a total of 226 countries, territories, or areas had issued 110,320
COVID-19-related travel measures. While these travel restrictions brought global human mobility and
migration almost at a standstill, exceptions were issued for returning nationals to facilitate the return
of those stranded abroad. Later in the year, as countries, territories or areas across the world began
reopening borders, allowing carefully managed mobility under stringent conditions, IOM also started
tracking the new conditions for authorized entry, including health surveillance applications, passenger
locator forms, medical health forms, medical certificates with negative COVID-19 test results,
quarantine at designated facilities and COVID-19 testing upon arrival.

67.     IOM has been extensively coordinating, both internally and with government counterparts and
private sector partners, to enable the continuous provision of support related to facilitated regular
pathways, while addressing increasingly complex challenges for migration management. Measures
adopted during the pandemic to ensure service continuity led to the development and
implementation of various digital tools and innovative approaches to service delivery that IOM will
continue to expand upon and improve to ensure the well-being of migrants and the efficient provision
of support to facilitate regular migration pathways, and enable societies to recover better from the
pandemic and advance sustainable development achievements. Visa applications are expected to
return to high levels after the gradual improvement of the global COVID-19 situation, driven by a
resumption of international cross-border mobility and the ongoing trend of governments to outsource
a wide range of visas, and their respective application processes.

                          Box 7. Tracking the mobility impacts of COVID-19

In response to the pandemic, countries, territories, and areas implemented complex and varied
mobility restrictions in attempts to contain and reduce the spread of the virus. Consequently, these
measures significantly impacted both human mobility and humanitarian actors’ access and delivery of
assistance to the most vulnerable populations worldwide. Through the DTM, and in collaboration with
key partners and stakeholders, IOM provided an evidence-based understanding of the impact of
COVID-19 on mobility at the global, country, cross-border, and interregional levels.

Globally, IOM published and shared more than 760 reports related to the impact of COVID-19 on
displaced persons, other migrant populations and mobility to help inform partners and key
stakeholders on COVID-19-associated mobility restrictions. A total of 63 COVID-19 Analytical Snapshots
were also published during the reporting period to improve the understanding of the migration and
mobility implications of COVID-19 by capturing the latest research, information and analysis related to
the various impacts of the pandemic, with the majority translated into the other five official languages
of the United Nations. The Migration Data Portal also developed a dedicated section on migration data
related to the pandemic, which is available in IOM’s three official languages and German. In addition,
DTM data and/or analysis informed COVID-19 response planning and actions by key public health
partners in at least 39 countries. IOM’s work on mobility restrictions mapping, which includes regular
                                                               assessments of the status of points of

                                                               mobility restrictions, has resulted in a
                                                               widely used global database with a

briefs examined the impacts of the pandemic on migration management, such as the analysis of
immigration, consular and visa trends, with a focus on barriers to accessing regular migration pathways
and the need for flexible admission and stay regulations, among other subjects.

The Organization also developed guidelines for staff on conducting data collection exercises during the
COVID-19 pandemic. Since the pandemic began, the Organization has increased global-level
coordination and collaboration with key data actors including OCHA, WHO, WFP, UNHCR, the global
humanitarian clusters and partners from the private sector and academia. For example, IOM co-leads
the Global Information Management, Assessment and Analysis Cell on COVID-19 with OCHA,
WHO/Global Health Cluster and UNHCR, and has continued joint work and discussions with WFP and
WHO on data and analysis. IOM has also carried out joint modelling work for IDPs with OCHA and Johns
Hopkins University in Nigeria, South Sudan and other countries, and collaborated with the Migration
Policy Institute to collate and analyse travel restriction and border closure data.

Regular and orderly migration

68.      The worldwide restrictions on cross-border mobility and travel directly affected IOM activities
to facilitate regular migration and cross-border mobility pathways. IOM responded to ensure the
resilience of its immigration and visa programmes, including its operations to support family
reunification through the Family Assistance Programme, Canada’s visa application centres and the IOM
humanitarian visa centres, reflecting the Organization’s commitment to supporting the gradual and
safe resumption of global mobility and strengthening inclusive regular migration. These programmes
contributed to mitigating the pandemic’s humanitarian and socioeconomic effects, which are key for
an inclusive long-term recovery from COVID-19.

69.     Moreover, physical distancing and lockdown measures also required an adjustment to
traditional, in-person interactions with migrants; as a result, the different services IOM provides were
adapted to better incorporate digital platforms and remote solutions. Innovative strategies have
included setting or scaling up contact centres and remote options for information provision; the use
of mobile channels for pre-registration; virtual counselling and psychosocial support for beneficiaries
of family reunification programmes; remote delivery of pre-departure orientation and integration
courses; piloting remote interviews; remote monitoring of programme activities; and the use of social
media for communications and community outreach activities. Further information on initiatives
undertaken by IOM in this regard are described in the DISC Digest special edition entitled No Social
Exclusion in ‘Social’ Distancing: Leaving No Migrants Behind in COVID-19 Response.

70.      For instance, during 2020, in adherence with health and local government directives, IOM’s
global network of 36 visa application centres was unable operate at regular capacity due to temporary
closures or significantly reduced operations. In comparison to 2019 figures, the network experienced
a 76 per cent decline in the number of visa applicants assisted during 2020. IOM initiated an
unprecedented restructuring effort to enhance the efficiency of the centres, developing dedicated
COVID-19 health and safety standard operating procedures, including training sessions on the new
measures. Enhanced cooperation with the Ministry of Justice of the Republic of Korea enabled IOM to
launch the first two Korea Visa Application Centres in Ulaanbaatar and Berlin, right before and during
the pandemic. Document verification programming was expanded during 2020, with an agreement to
initiate activities on behalf of Germany in Uganda, and for the United Kingdom in Ethiopia, Kenya, the
Sudan, Uganda and Zimbabwe.

71.     IOM’s network of 10 Family Assistance Programme centres also continued to provide
uninterrupted remote assistance for family reunification beneficiaries by adapting procedures to
comply with the health measures in place, while prioritizing urgent cases.

72.      The lessons learned from responding to the protracted global emergency have
proven valuable for the evolution of IOM’s global immigration and visa programmes and their ongoing
transition towards a model with a greater emphasis on sustainable operations and future
preparedness. IOM contributes to safe and orderly migration by mitigating the risks associated with
cross-border mobility and by supporting orderly pathways for migration. IOM’s expertise in supporting
the admission and stay policies of its Member States, including their consular and visa systems, is a key
component of the Organization’s vision to expand its role in fostering global mobility and migration
governance.

73.     One of the core functions of the Organization is arranging the safe and dignified movement of
refugees and migrants. In 2020, humanitarian movements were primarily focused on resettlement,
family reunification, voluntary humanitarian return, European Union relocation, and repatriation.

74.      Due to the significant impact of COVID-19 on the movement of people, the airline industry,
public health and border regimes, IOM temporarily postponed movement operations for resettlement
from 21 March to 17 June 2020, after close consultations with Member States and UNHCR and an
assessment of crucial operational concerns. Nevertheless, during the reporting period, urgent
resettlement for critical cases continued to take place, as well as European Union relocations, charter
flights for voluntary humanitarian return, return movements coordinated by the returns task force at
IOM Headquarters and the provision of humanitarian assistance to stranded migrants.

75.      In 2020, IOM supported over 27 States in conducting resettlement, humanitarian admissions
and relocation activities for a total of 40,536 refugees and other persons in situations of vulnerability,
with significant operations out of Afghanistan, Greece, Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey. The top three
resettlement countries were the United States of America, Canada and Sweden. Of the above-
mentioned total, 3,063 beneficiaries in need of international protection were relocated from Greece,
Italy and Malta to 12 destination countries in the European Economic Area (a majority of whom were
moved via charter flight).

76.     IOM facilitated the repatriation of 30,735 refugees to their country of origin, with Burundi and
the Democratic Republic of the Congo being the top two destination countries. Of those beneficiaries,
a vast majority were moved by land using ground transportation from the United Republic of Tanzania
to Burundi.

77.     IOM also assisted 13,974 persons in situations of vulnerability via international charter flights.
Through voluntary humanitarian return, a total of 4,041 vulnerable migrants located in Libya and
Yemen were supported in their return to their countries of origin, namely Bangladesh, Ethiopia, the
Niger and the Sudan.

78.     During 2020, nine IOM offices had helped their governments to establish or expand their
resettlement programmes. In Denmark, IOM supported the Government in relaunching its
resettlement programme, while in Finland and the Netherlands, following several years of
negotiations, the respective government authorities and IOM signed new framework agreements on
resettlement cooperation. Additionally, with the overall management role lying with IOM and partners
in Greece, IOM country offices in the region supported European Union Member States in
implementing the largest number of relocations since the end of the European Union-wide emergency
relocation scheme which was implemented between 2015 and 2018. In this context, in France, IOM
supported the Government in preparing the ground for the first ever relocation of unaccompanied
children, and in Germany IOM liaised closely with the Government to facilitate the relocation of
children with particular medical conditions and their family members.

79.     During the reporting period, IOM-led training courses and policy guidance contributed to the
improvement of resettlement programmes in 12 countries. Additionally, through the continuous
support provided by the Sustainable Resettlement and Complementary Pathways Initiative (CRISP),
there has been a considerable increase in capacity-building initiatives, such as the provision of
technical support to three emerging resettlement programmes in Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay on
programme design; the creation of a joint IOM-UNHCR resettlement training package that targets
relevant government and non-governmental actors involved in the design, development and
implementation of resettlement and complementary pathway programmes; and support to key
stakeholders on providing psychosocial support to refugees and migrants in Argentina and Brazil.

                  Box 8. Support to stranded migrants and other vulnerable groups

During 2020, COVID-19 had a widespread impact on human mobility due to travel restrictions, border
closures and lockdown measures, which stranded migrants across the world. In addition, loss of jobs
and income, limited or high-risk employment opportunities, loss of residence permits, and a lack of
resources to return home all hindered mobility. This situation has in turn further compounded
migrants’ already limited access, or prevented their access, to health care and social support, exposed
them to stigmatization and xenophobia, and put them at risk of homelessness or detention in
overcrowded facilities, while at the same time heightening their vulnerabilities to the disease. As being
stranded often confers few prospects or limits the ability to return home without assistance, IOM
mobilized its multisectoral capabilities to organize voluntary returns for stranded migrants seeking to
return home. Assistance to stranded migrants was one of the Director General’s key priorities in 2020.

In response to the complex challenge of facilitating movements during the pandemic, IOM quickly
established the COVID-19 Return Task Force to ensure an efficient, coherent approach and leverage
the expertise from IOM’s different thematic units. IOM supported 2,677 migrants worldwide to return
home in a safe and dignified manner, through both commercial flights and organized charters. Task
Force funding supported 1,100 beneficiaries for return, with IOM missions assisting an additional 1,577
beneficiaries in coordination with the Task Force. Charters were organized despite countries being in
lockdown or airports being closed for commercial travel. The DTM supported the Task Force and
country offices in tracking requests for assistance and monitoring stranded migrants. Additionally, in
2020, IOM arranged the return of 151 stranded migrants to their countries of origin through the
Humanitarian Assistance to Stranded Migrants fund.

As part of a comprehensive support package, IOM also provided different types of return support to
stranded migrants, such as flights and travel documentation services, with a total of 107,212
individuals receiving some sort of return-related assistance in 2020. These return services and
processes were adapted to ensure adherence with COVID-19 prevention and mitigation measures. In
addition, 167,216 beneficiaries were assisted in transit centres using enhanced COVID-19 protocols
and standard operation procedures. In addition to return support, IOM has been providing assistance
to meet the needs of stranded migrants, such as food; shelter; childcare; health assistance, including
psychosocial counselling; risk communication; and COVID-19 preventative measures. Globally in 2020,
a total of 73,869 vulnerable or stranded migrants were assisted with case management services in the
light of the COVID-19 pandemic.

80.      Assisted voluntary return remained a key priority during 2020 even though the possibility to
provide support to migrants wishing to return home became more limited due to COVID-19. Despite
the challenges, IOM adapted its programmes and continued to support migrants throughout the world
to voluntarily return to their countries of origin, wherever feasible. While the principles of assisted
voluntary return and reintegration have remained unchanged during the COVID-19 outbreak, new
procedures needed to be introduced to make returns possible and ensure the protection and safety of
all involved.

81.      Over 42,000 migrants were assisted to return (as opposed to 64,958 in 2019), from 139 host
countries (destination or transit) to 150 countries of origin. The majority were assisted to return from
the Niger, Germany and Kazakhstan to Mali Guinea and Tajikistan. In 2020, the European Economic
Area continued to be the main host region for beneficiaries of assisted voluntary return, with 39.4 per
cent of the total number. Similar to 2019, West and Central Africa was the main region of origin. More
than 120 offices engaged in reintegration support that ranged from medical and psychosocial
assistance to financial services and material support.

82.      In addition, return support, primarily through charter flights, but also through ground
transportation and commercial flights, was provided to migrants in various countries including Algeria,
Belize, Burkina Faso, Lebanon, Nicaragua, the Niger and the Philippines. In supporting migrants to
return to their home countries, IOM missions also provided humanitarian assistance kits that included
food, information, pre-embarkation health checks, COVID-19 testing where required, and necessary
supplies to comply with health protocols and COVID-19 prevention measures. Medical escorts
travelled with individuals with significant medical conditions.

83.     Despite severe economic disruptions in 2020 due to COVID-19, labour shortages in certain
locations and sectors did not disappear, but rather increased, highlighting the dependency on the
cross-border recruitment of workers in agriculture, health, delivery and other sectors. This finding was
reiterated during a joint virtual workshop organized by IOM and the Government of Portugal on
regulating labour mobility, 9 held in September 2020.

84.      IOM undertook a number of regional and migration corridor-specific projects that
demonstrated the adaptability of human mobility schemes. Examples include the projects entitled
Towards a Holistic Approach to Labour Migration Governance and Labour Mobility in North Africa;
Poverty Reduction through Skills Development for Safe and Regular Migration in Cambodia, the Lao
People’s Democratic Republic, Myanmar and Thailand; and the EU-funded MATCH project – Hiring
African Talents. Through the latter project, IOM proposed new solutions to companies that addressed
their needs in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, including enabling the hiring of nationals from
Nigeria and Senegal on a remote basis until the travel restrictions were in place. Through a network of
local partners, IOM ensured that companies were able to start working with their new specialists,
hiring via local branches or providing full support for their new staff, including a working space and
tools. As a second solution, IOM supported companies to hire a limited quota of Nigerian and
Senegalese nationals already residing in the European Union through established solid links with
respective diaspora communities residing in the relevant European Union countries.

85.      In 2020, IOM continued to support efforts linking migration policies with skills development,
training, recognition and transfer, building upon the work of the Global Skills Partnership on Migration.
For example, at global level, IOM provided input and support to the thematic discussions of the GFMD
on skilling migrants for employment. At the regional level, the Organization contributed to relevant
activities and discussions of the Joint Programme on Labour Migration Governance for Development
and Integration in Africa; the Regional Ministerial Forum on Harmonizing Labour Migration Policies in
the East and Horn of Africa; the Colombo Process; and the Governance of Labour Migration in South
and South-East Asia programme – implemented with ILO and UN-Women, and supported by the Swiss
Agency for Development and Cooperation. IOM also supported activities along specific labour
migration corridors, for example along the corridor between Costa Rica and Panama with regard to
temporary employment on coffee plantations in Costa Rica.

Safe migration

86.     Migrants and displaced populations have been especially vulnerable to the consequences of
the pandemic. Individuals living in crowded conditions, as well as camps or camp-like settings, have
faced an increased risk of infection, from COVID-19 and other health threats. There is ample evidence
that the pandemic has exacerbated many of the existing vulnerabilities faced by migrants and other
people on the move, including their level of exposure to disease and mental health challenges. In many
cases, mobility-related policies and lockdown measures taken to reduce the transmission of the virus
have created significant additional challenges for these populations, including barriers in accessing
essential health services.

87.      The challenges faced during the pandemic highlighted the need to design and implement
flexible solutions within programmes to enable them to respond to external shocks. This led to the
enactment of significant restructuring efforts and cost-saving measures that, in turn, enabled
programme continuity, with the aim to emerge from the pandemic with an improved and strengthened
reporting structure, while enabling more efficient core management and oversight functions that are
better prepared for recovery and the gradual resumption of global mobility.

88.     Since the beginning of the pandemic, IOM has worked with States, partners, communities and
staff to ensure that migrants, displaced populations and communities have continued access to
essential health services, while supporting health systems and service delivery and providing support
to vulnerable communities affected by COVID-19 in humanitarian settings and beyond. Many countries
struggled to provide care to critically ill COVID-19 patients, while other services were sidelined to
ensure that health systems had the resources to deal with surges in COVID-19 cases. To mitigate this
pressure on health systems, IOM mobilized its pre-existing human resources and deployed staff to
support COVID-19-related programmes from the onset of the pandemic. IOM also supported the
continued provision of life-saving primary health care, including sexual and reproductive health and
gender-based violence services; nutrition support; case management of noncommunicable diseases;
HIV, malaria, and tuberculosis services; and mental health and psychosocial support around the world.
During 2020, IOM supported 570 health facilities in dozens of countries to maintain essential
immunization services. More than 120 IOM clinical staff from its migration health assessment
programmes (including medical officers, radiologists, and radiographers) were deployed to contribute
to national COVID-19 responses with the overall aim of supporting and strengthening health systems.

89.      Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, many of IOM’s routine pre-migration health activities were
temporarily suspended in 2020. Despite the challenges presented by the pandemic, the IOM Global
Migration Health Assessment Programme managed to preserve capacity to provide full-fledged pre-
migration health activities, in addition to introducing new measures and initiatives in response to the
pandemic and in support of its beneficiaries. New measures included the establishment of a multi-
platform laboratory testing approach for COVID-19 and the inclusion of phone triage and other
infection prevention and control measures at IOM migration health assessment centres. Though
service provision drastically decreased in the first half of the year, from the middle of the year, the
caseload slowly began to recover and, by the end of 2020, IOM missions had provided nearly a quarter
of a million migration health assessments worldwide.

90.      In close coordination with key partners, IOM quickly scaled up its activities to address the
needs of migrants, displaced populations, and communities, anchoring the Organization’s response in
its comprehensive understanding of population mobility and its cross-sectoral expertise. IOM swiftly
adapted its programming in accordance with the latest guidelines to help control the spread of
COVID-19, integrating COVID-19 considerations, such as bolstering infection prevention and control
efforts; procuring and distributing supplies, including personal protection equipment; ramping up
health promotion and risk communication efforts; and enhancing regional and national disease
-----------------------Page 30 End-----------------------

                                                                                          C/112/INF/1
                                                                                              Page 23


surveillance, information-sharing, and reporting. More than 38,290 trained community health workers
and risk communication and community engagement mobilizers delivered risk communication
activities as part of IOM programming to help break the chains of transmission. To provide mental
health and psychosocial support services to beneficiaries, IOM provided related training in the context
of the COVID-19 response to 26,343 community members, partners and government staff. To
contribute to the diagnosis and monitoring of cases of COVID-19, IOM provided 109,191 COVID-19
tests globally and supported 100 disease surveillance systems in 29 countries.

91.      Acknowledging their essential role in health-care provision, IOM also supported over 9,490
community health workers globally to contribute to the maintenance of essential services despite
COVID-19 restrictions. Alongside fixed and mobile clinic consultations adapted to implement enhanced
infection prevention and control measures, IOM provided over 8,580 telemedicine consultations
worldwide to reduce obstacles to primary health-care access in the context of COVID-19. In numerous
locations, IOM supported health facilities with infrastructure rehabilitation, capacity-building and
training, human resources, the provision of essential equipment and medicines, information,
education and communication materials, and improvements in infection prevention and control
measures, including strengthened WASH infrastructure and services and the procurement of personal
protective equipment.

                                    Box 9. COVID-19 vaccination

IOM has been a key player in global efforts to ensure that migrants and mobile populations have access
to routine vaccinations. IOM vaccination activities are undertaken in dozens of locations, both
routinely and in response to outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases, aiming to improve the health
of migrants, hard-to-reach mobile populations, internally displaced persons, refugees and host
communities by increasing key vaccine coverage. These services require a robust vaccine distribution
and storage system – including maintaining appropriate cold chain equipment and establishing
prevention measures against cold chain failure, such as temperature monitoring and alert systems –
which IOM ensures through its primary health-care programmes and migration health centres. To
ensure the appropriate administration of vaccines, IOM staff are provided with ongoing relevant
training in line with international standards.

IOM is a member of the United Nations COVID-19 Supply Chain Taskforce, which includes the COVAX
Facility. Partnerships with actors such as with the COVAX Facility have also been critical in ensuring
that migrants, displaced populations and communities are considered in COVID-19 vaccination efforts.
IOM has advocated the inclusion of migrants in vaccine priority groups and roll-out plans, including
through participation in the IASC Working Group on the Humanitarian Buffer.

With a view to continuing to contribute to immunization efforts and achievement of the health-related
SDGs, including in terms of universal health coverage, IOM has continued to foster strategic
partnerships with partners that aim to ensure the inclusion of migrants in future and ongoing
COVID-19 vaccination efforts. Notably, in November 2020, IOM signed a memorandum of
understanding with the Gavi Alliance, aimed at strengthening collaboration on vaccination efforts and
related health services for migrants, including forcibly displaced persons, for both routine
immunizations and in response to outbreaks. This will further enable the engagement of IOM country
offices around the world in immunization programmes, which will be particularly critical in ensuring
that migrants are considered and included in national allocation plans for COVID-19 vaccines.

92.      IOM remained a leader in provision of migrant protection and assistance services, including
for victims of trafficking, migrants made vulnerable to violence, exploitation and abuse because of the
pandemic, and vulnerable migrant children. For example, in Yemen, IOM provided individual
protection assistance, including psychosocial support and cash for protection, shelter, food and NFIs
-----------------------Page 31 End-----------------------

C/112/INF/1
Page 24


to over 1,000 vulnerable migrants. In Ukraine, IOM also continued its decades-long efforts to protect
and assist victims of trafficking; thanks to its proactive identification and referral work, the IOM Office
in Ukraine was able to assist 1,680 victims of trafficking and 249 persons at risk of trafficking and
exploitation, including within internally displaced and conflict-affected populations. In Kyrgyzstan, IOM
assisted a range of migrant groups in situations of vulnerability, including national and international
victims of trafficking, Kyrgyz migrants stranded abroad and migrants stranded in Kyrgyzstan.

93.      IOM continued its capacity-building efforts in support of State and non-State actors to identify,
refer, protect and assist victims of trafficking and other migrants in situations of vulnerability. For
example, in partnership with Lao Women’s Union, the IOM Office in the Lao People’s Democratic
Republic supported the development and dissemination of the National Guideline for Protection,
Assistance and Referral of Victims of Trafficking. The IOM Office in Mali trained 95 law enforcement
officers, government agents and shelter providers on working with victims of trafficking.

94.      At the global level, the 20th anniversary of the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish
Trafficking in Persons, especially Women and Children, was an opportunity for IOM to review the
Organization’s several decades of work in combating trafficking with a view to consolidating its
expertise and identifying priority areas of intervention for IOM’s future counter-trafficking work.

           Box 10. First line of defence – Global Migration Health Assessment Programme

Since its establishment in 1951, IOM has delivered pre-migration health activities through its Global
Migration Health Assessment Programme, on behalf of destination countries and migrants. These
activities are undertaken at IOM migration health assessment centres located across Africa, Asia,
Europe and the Middle East, and by mobile teams in remote areas and a large network of partner
service providers.

As part of its COVID-19 response, the IOM First Line of Defence framework, established in 2020,
harnessed the Organization’s health assessment capacities and infrastructure to provide reliable and
high-quality medical services to eligible United Nations personnel and their dependents. By the end of
the reporting period, the framework had been implemented in 18 countries, and included the delivery
of a range of services, namely laboratory services, including testing for COVID-19; clinical services;
telemedicine and home monitoring services; and medical movement support. Under the framework,
IOM also established three isolation facilities and introduced COVID-19 testing capacity at 16 sites,
using a novel multi-platform testing approach, with over 250 IOM health staff being accredited to
provide testing services. By the end of 2020, over 5,500 United Nations beneficiaries had received at
least one service under the framework and the feedback received from the United Nations community
was very positive.

95.     Efficient and rights-based border and immigration management policies and structures,
supported by professional and well-trained personnel, facilitate and foster enhanced movement
management, development and trade at borders. They also contribute to preventing exploitative and
irregular migration, dismantling organized criminal networks and effectively protecting the rights of
migrants.

96.     IOM continued to expand its work in the area of protecting migrant workers’ rights through
mobilizing governmental and non-State stakeholders to achieve ethical recruitment standards.
Working in synergy with other lead organizations and initiatives active in this area, IOM broadened its
footprint and the scope of capacity-building tools and mechanisms in line with its International
Recruitment Integrity System (IRIS). This complemented the work of partners such as the ILO and the
Responsible Business Alliance. In addition to IRIS, IOM expanded its partnerships with the private
sector within the CREST initiative – achieving impressive results in South and South-East Asia – and
-----------------------Page 32 End-----------------------

                                                                                           C/112/INF/1
                                                                                               Page 25


started to gradually broaden the scope of the initiative to other regions. As of 2020, 65 countries had
embarked on implementing IRIS-related procedures and processes. More than 300 recruiters were
trained on the IRIS standard in 2020, and IOM continued to engage with over 60 companies (new and
ongoing partnerships) across more than 50 projects.

97.     A significant milestone in IOM’s work on ethical recruitment and the protection of migrant
workers’ rights was the launch of the Global Policy Network on Recruitment in December 2020 as a
follow-up to the Global Conference on the Regulation of International Recruitment, which adopted a
set of non-binding recommendations that are fully compatible with all existing international norms
and standards, in particular those established by the ILO.

98.      In 2020, IOM continued to support States in responding to diverse migration and border and
identity management challenges. One hundred and eight country offices reported having worked on
border management-related issues during the reporting period. In Kenya, in partnership with
TradeMark East Africa, IOM facilitated COVID-19 testing for truck drivers at borders as part of efforts
to safely reopen trade across the East and Horn of Africa, testing more than 4,500 truck drivers and
crew in Malaba and Busia on the Kenya–Uganda border. This helped to ease the backlog of trucks stuck
at the border and release essential trade. The IOM Office in Kenya also tested over 26,356 truck drivers
in the port city of Mombasa, responsible for transporting medicine, food, fuel and other essential
goods across countries in the region.

99.      In 2020, IOM also supported over 1,050 points of entry globally to undertake COVID-19
preparedness and response measures and trained over 14,920 officials on COVID-19 detection,
notification and management, and on the referral of ill travellers. These capacity-building efforts
sought to encourage the development of effective and inclusive immigration systems that support
socioeconomic recovery.

100. To enhance the capacity of officials and to support the adaptation of their operational
practices in response to COVID-19, the Training Curriculum for Border Officials on COVID-19 Response
at Points of Entry was developed by IOM. The training curriculum draws upon the latest WHO reference
materials, including the International Health Regulations (2005), on points of entry preparedness and
response. IOM also developed the Standard Operating Procedures for Front-line Border Officials at the
Point of Entry in Response to COVID-19 Outbreak, which were piloted in Bangladesh, Cambodia, the
Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Libya, the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia,
Mongolia, Myanmar, Thailand and Viet Nam.

Governance

101. The role played by IOM in the international sphere has increased in recent years as a result of
increased migration volumes and greater international attention to migration. This became
increasingly apparent in 2020 with the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on migrants and mobility.
With IOM’s role as Coordinator of the United Nations Network on Migration supporting the
implementation of the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration, there were increased
demands for IOM policy advice on migration issues, including through coordinated efforts within the
United Nations system. IOM also worked to ensure that good migration governance was consistently
integrated into and contributes to United Nations efforts to achieve the SDGs. The Organization’s
capacity to provide such whole-of-society support to governments at local and national level,
supported by a robust architecture for data, evidence and research is, therefore, of increasing
importance, and its ability to translate its vast field experience into tangible policy recommendations
is an essential part of IOM’s mission.
-----------------------Page 33 End-----------------------

IOM participation and leadership in the United Nations system

102. The Organization continued to forge strong bilateral partnerships with various international
actors. IOM’s involvement in United Nations structures has further deepened at the global, regional,
and country levels. IOM became a core group member of the United Nations Sustainable Development
Group in 2020 and has made progress on several commitments in line with its role as Coordinator
of the United Nations Network on Migration and the IOM Institutional Strategy on Migration
and Sustainable Development and related action plan. In 2020, up to 68 per cent of IOM offices
reported that migration and mobility aspects were now captured in common country analyses,
and 35 IOM offices announced that they had signed – and had ensured the integration of migration
management programming into – new United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation
Frameworks. In 2020, 111 offices developed joint programming initiatives with other United Nations
agencies, and over 70 IOM missions signed off on the Business Operations Strategy Results Framework
in the context of the efficiency agenda of the United Nations Secretary-General.

103. During the reporting period, 129 IOM offices supported governments in
the implementation of the 2030 Agenda and the SDGs. In various countries, IOM helped to increase
understanding among government officials that migration should be seen as an opportunity that can
promote social and economic growth. Within its efforts on SDG-related reporting requirements, in line
with IOM’s commitments under the Funding Compact, the Organization strengthened its internal
capacity to report on contributions to the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration that
will – inter alia – provide input to the Secretary General’s continued reporting on Global Compact
implementation. In addition, in 2020, the United Nations Statistical Commission adopted a new
Indicator 10.7.3 (number of people who died or disappeared in the process of migration towards an
international destination), which uses data exclusively from the Missing Migrants Project.

104. The level of engagement with the United Nations system through membership of a number of
working groups continues to expand at all levels. The level and complexity of this engagement spans
diverse topics, and encompasses broad, often cross-cutting themes, including United Nations reform;
the Business Operations Strategy and mutual recognition; collaboration on operational activities such
as the FLOD Framework, the COVAX Facility and joint programming; technical topics such as IPSAS
(International Public Sector Accounting Standards) and IATI implementation and reporting; and
participation in the International Civil Service Commission.

105. As the Coordinator of the United Nations Network on Migration, IOM has further strengthened
its policy and operational support at Headquarters and across the regional and country offices to
support UNCTs and Member States in the implementation, follow-up and review of the Global
Compact. For example, IOM led and worked through UNCTs to establish 41 national and 6 regional
networks on migration by the end of 2020 and successfully organized the first regional review of the
Global Compact in Europe in November 2020. In addition, IOM took the lead in drafting the first Report
of the United Nations Secretary-General on the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular
Migration. Internally, IOM strengthened its capacity to equip IOM staff with the tools necessary to fulfil
the Organization’s role as Coordinator of the Network. This included linking the Global Compact – as a
key policy framework – to the IOM Strategic Vision 2019–2023 and its regional strategies.

106. Serving as the Network Secretariat, as mandated by the United Nations General Assembly,
IOM is also providing system-wide support for the implementation of the Global Compact. During the
reporting period, the Secretariat supported the Network (39 members including the 9 Executive
Committee members, with WHO having joined the Executive Committee in 2020 as a result of its
leading role in the COVID-19 response) and the Coordinator in carrying out the Network’s workplan
and responding to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Coordinator of the Network, the IOM

                                                                                          C/112/INF/1
                                                                                              Page 27


Director General, successfully launched the Champion Countries initiative, which is supported
by 16 Member States, during the reporting period.

107. The Secretariat of the Network also coordinated efforts to operationalize the capacity-building
mechanism – including the Migration Network Hub, led by the IOM Global Migration Data Analysis
Centre, and the Migration MPTF – launching guidance and tools to bolster the capacity of UNCTs and
to support Member States in developing national implementation plans, and ensuring strong and
meaningful engagement by non-governmental and local government stakeholders in the work of the
Network.

          Box 11. Start-up Fund for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration (Migration MPTF)

During the course of 2020, the Migration MPTF – the first pooled funding instrument focused on
migration, which was established in 2019 – became fully operational. A key takeaway from the first
year of operations was the strong and consistent demand for financing from the Fund; demand which
far outweighed supply. In 2020, 62 countries and regions submitted a total of 90 joint programme
concept notes, covering a wide array of issues, offering concrete illustrations of how the Fund can
support Global Compact implementation on the ground.

In October 2020, the Steering Committee approved funding for six inaugural joint programmes. From
addressing security, development and humanitarian concerns in the cross-border areas of Guinea,
Sierra Leone and Liberia, to strengthening the capacity of the Government of the Philippines to support
overseas workers throughout the migration cycle, promoting socioeconomic integration of migrants,
refugees and asylum seekers in Santiago (Chile) and Mexico City, and creating opportunities for free
movement and green jobs, markets and skills in climate fragile locations in the Intergovernmental
Authority on Development region, these joint programmes address a myriad of migration challenges
and are poised to make positive impacts on the lives of migrants and those affected by migration. The
joint programmes funded reflect the faithfulness to the Global Compact 360-degree approach and the
Steering Committee’s commitment to geographic diversity. With single country, cross-border and
regional programmes, as well as an emphasis on sub-national partnerships, the selection also
illustrates how Global Compact implementation is relevant at all levels.

By the end of 2020 – and despite the COVID-19 pandemic, which seriously impacted the mobilization
of resources for the Migration MPTF – the Fund had received generous contributions totalling over
USD 17 million, from 11 Member States: Cyprus, Denmark, France, Germany, Mexico, Norway,
Portugal, Sweden, Thailand, Turkey and the United Kingdom (the original target for the Fund’s first
year of operations was USD 25 million).

While recognizing the increased financial constraints, rebuilding the pre-COVID-19 momentum is
critical for the Fund. In 2021, it is hoped that the Fund will grow into the vision behind the Member
States’ collective call for its establishment back in 2018: a tool by which to enhance effective and
principled governance of migration.

108. IOM is a member of practically all UNCTs worldwide. As of December 2020, 149 countries
reported IOM as a resident United Nations agency in their country.

109. Sixty-eight IOM offices reported that a national or regional network structure exists in the
country or region. In addition to the networks on migration at country level (41), IOM is also involved
in inter-agency working groups on migration and/or asylum issues. Thirty-nine countries reported that
their respective working groups were ensuring that migration was incorporated into the United
Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Frameworks for those countries.
-----------------------Page 35 End-----------------------

C/112/INF/1
Page 28


110. IOM partners with a broad range of agencies at all levels of the United Nations system. For
example, in Armenia, IOM, UNDP, UNICEF, and UNFPA worked with partner agencies UNHCR, the
United Nations Industrial Development Organization and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the
United Nations to set up a project to mitigate of socioeconomic impact of COVID-19 on vulnerable
people and communities.

111. In Chad, IOM partnered with the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and
UNHCR on the implementation of projects to support displaced populations and host communities in
Lac Province. The partnership with the two organizations has made it possible to provide a
comprehensive response to the various needs of the diverse population groups in need in the province.

112. During the reporting period, IOM provided technical and policy support to 108 national
governments and 17 local governments for the operationalization of the Global Compact. This entails
support for development of action plans and relevant migration policies; the holding of national
consultations and workshops on the Global Compact; and engagement with relevant stakeholders. For
example, following positive engagement on the Global Compact in Ethiopia, the country joined the
Champion Country initiative and IOM supported the Government in drafting its first voluntary report
on Global Compact implementation. For this, a consultative process was undertaken, involving several
ministries and CSOs. In addition, IOM, as coordinator of the United Nations Network on Migration in
Ethiopia, facilitated four meetings of that Network in 2020.

113. IOM provided technical assistance to the Government of Kazakhstan on the development of
the first voluntary national review of Global Compact implementation. The review focused on clarifying
the implementation methodology and analysis structure with all government agencies and members
of the established working group. Information was provided by the Ministries of Internal Affairs;
Labour and Social Protection of the Population; Healthcare; Information and Public Development; and
Education and Science.

114. In Sri Lanka, migration forums were established in a number of districts to focus on collecting
migration-related data, in order to contribute to evidence-based decision-making, advocacy and policy
development. These forums will also serve as a platform to share up-to-date information on current
practices and migration trends, and policies and guidelines relevant to labour migration. Furthermore,
the forums will be an ideal platform to enable all stakeholders to support migrants in the respective
districts and enhance services to migrants, including psycho-social and reintegration support.

Whole-of-government approach

115. IOM further strengthened its efforts to build governments’ capacities to formulate sound
migration policies that are aligned with the objectives of Global Compact and coherent with and
integrated into sustainable development planning frameworks.

116. In 2020, IOM worked with 49 countries that assessed the comprehensiveness of their
migration governance frameworks and discussed well-managed migration policies and practices using
the Migration Governance Indicators process. In line with IOM’s objective to produce tangible impact
and positive policy change, 42 IOM offices reported having supported countries that had previously
conducted an assessment to follow up on the results through specific, targeted activities leading to
the development of new migration policies and strategies (e.g. the new Migrant Health Policy in
Cambodia; the National Migration Policy and National Action Plan for Trafficking in Persons 2020-2023
in Sierra Leone, and the 2030 National Strategy on Migration in Tajikistan) and the development of a
more inclusive and whole-of-government approach to migration governance. The Indicators have also
proved effective in laying the basis for countries (e.g. Cambodia, Guinea-Bissau, Mauritania, the
Republic of Moldova and Sierra Leone) to draft action plans and track progress on Global Compact

commitments and have been mentioned by Member States in Global Compact regional reviews
(e.g. Guyana and Timor-Leste).

117. In Mali, IOM supported the elaboration of the country’s migration policy, which draws upon
the vision of leveraging migration as a poverty reduction tool for the country. The policy aims to
recognize and empower migrants as agents of development.

118. In Zambia, as part of implementation of the Seventh National Development Plan, IOM
provided support to the Government of Zambia on the development of a comprehensive national
migration policy (currently in draft format); the process has led to increased acknowledgement by a
wide range of stakeholders that migration has complex relationships with many different government
portfolios, necessitating a whole-of-government approach.

119. In Brazil, IOM partnered with the Municipal Government of São Paulo to implement the
Migration Governance Indicators. In addition, through an IOM Development Fund project to enhance
local government capacities to address migration, 27 local governments have, through the
MigraCidades certification process, set priorities and committed to specific targets to improve local
policies and structures to promote migrants’ rights, well-being and integration.

120. Through two global initiatives – the IOM–UNDP Global Programme on Making Migration Work
for Sustainable Development and the IOM–European Union initiative on Mainstreaming Migration into
International Cooperation and Development – IOM supported national and local governments, and
development cooperation actors to strengthen the links between migration policies and sustainable
development. For instance, in Ecuador, IOM supported local governments and cities to strengthen
integrated policies by ensuring that migrants’ needs and capabilities are duly considered, including in
COVID-19 socioeconomic recovery plans.

                                  Box 12. IOM Development Fund

In 2020, a total of USD 21,109,296 (including administrative costs) was available for the IOM
Development Fund. Continuing the trend of recent years, project funding requests increased in 2020,
mainly as a result of the growing need of eligible Member States for seed funding to address various
migration management challenges. The Fund continues to be a vital means of advancing migration and
sustainable development policies and programmes.

A total of 75 projects for 124 eligible Member States were financed in 2020 through the IOM
Development Fund. As in previous years, the distribution of allocations to each region was closely
aligned with the representation of eligible Member States in those regions. In Africa, the IOM
Development Fund provided USD 6,900,000 for 26 initiatives benefiting 24 eligible Member States. In
the Middle East, one initiative benefiting one eligible Member State received USD 300,000. In Latin
America and the Caribbean, a total of USD 4,184,957 was allocated to 16 initiatives benefiting
21 eligible Member States. In Asia and Oceania, 22 initiatives benefiting 22 Member States received
USD 5,980,339. In Europe, a total of USD 2,200,000 was allocated to eight projects benefiting eight
eligible Member States. Two multiregional projects were approved for a total of USD 800,000,
benefiting Member States eligible for Line 2 funding.

121. Fifty-nine IOM offices reported on their work with regional consultative processes on
migration, mostly providing technical advice. Nine offices worked with the Colombo Process, eight
were involved in the Almaty Process on refugee protection and international migration, and several
offices in South America also engaged with the Quito Process to facilitate regional intergovernmental
coordination of the response for refugees and migrants from the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela.
-----------------------Page 37 End-----------------------

122. Twenty-five country offices reported engaging with interregional forums on migration, for
example the Bali Process on People Smuggling, Trafficking in Persons and Related Transnational Crime,
the Ibero-American Network of Migration Authorities, the Budapest Process, the Khartoum Process
and the Pan-African Forum on Migration. Nine IOM offices offered technical advice to interregional
forums on migration, five provided technical secretariat functions and four provided administrative
secretariat functions.

123. The Twelfth GFMD Summit, hosted by the 2019 Chair, Ecuador, was postponed to January
2020. As a result, the subsequent Chair, the United Arab Emirates, only assumed the role in February
2020. Consequently, IOM provided GFMD-related support to both the Governments of Ecuador and
the United Arab Emirates over the course of 2020, providing thematic, technical, financial and logistical
support for preparations for the Twelfth Summit, held in person in Quito, and the Thirteenth Summit,
which took place in January 2021. In addition to its thematic lead on Skilling Migrants for Employment
round table events, co-steering the Mayors Mechanism and co-organizing the Sixth Mayoral Forum,
IOM also contributed to the development and roll-out of the It Takes a Community global campaign to
promote a balanced and evidence-based public narrative on migration. IOM also supported youth
engagement, in collaboration with United Nations Major Group for Children and Youth and UNICEF,
through the Youth Forum on the sidelines of the GFMD and the Youth Leadership & Innovation Award.

124. To inform the engagement of regional consultative processes on migration, interregional
forums on migration and global processes on migration in the Global Compact, a high-level webinar
on the potential role of inter-State consultation mechanisms on migration in the Global Compact
regional reviews was organized by IOM on 24 September 2020. Representatives from 22 mechanisms
took part in the proceedings; many mentioned their plans to contribute to the forthcoming process of
regional reviews of Global Compact implementation on different aspects of regional migration
governance.

125. In 2020, the IDM – IOM’s principal multi-stakeholder forum for migration policy dialogue – was
dedicated to discussing the implications of the COVID-19 pandemic for migrants and human mobility,
as well as migrants’ role in the response to and recovery from the pandemic. The decision to convene
the IDM 2020 on this theme was in response to the significant health, social, political, economic and
human mobility impacts of the COVID-19 crisis and the recognition of the need for greater
international commitment and cooperation to respond to these impacts. The IDM 2020 contributed
to collective efforts to address the immediate challenges and expected longer-term impacts of the
pandemic on societies, migrants and vulnerable populations worldwide, and to foster greater
cooperation and partnerships for future action.

126. The session, entitled COVID-19 crisis: reimagining the role of migrants and human mobility for
the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals, was held on 15 and 16 October, with
approximately 500 participants, representing governments, international governmental and non-
governmental organizations, academia, health institutions, youth, and migrant and diaspora
organizations. The speakers shared a comprehensive set of actions, practices and opportunities to
support migrants, including vulnerable populations, throughout the COVID-19 response and recovery
process and to facilitate migrants’ contributions to these efforts. An analysis of the discussions and a
set of best practices and recommendations gathered during the session are available in IDM 30:
COVID-19 Crisis: Reimagining the Role of Migrants and Human Mobility for the Achievement of the
Sustainable Development Goals.

127. In 2020, IOM raised awareness and built internal and external capacities on adherence to and
implementation of international legal standards relevant to migration. This was done through
numerous training courses for external stakeholders (notably for civil servants from the Plurinational
State of Bolivia, the Comoros and Kenya), including the organization and delivery of two annual courses
-----------------------Page 38 End-----------------------

                                                                                            C/112/INF/1
                                                                                                Page 31


on international migration law in collaboration with the International Institute of Humanitarian Law.
The Organization also carried out training activities for IOM staff on international migration law and a
rights-based approach to programming.

128. Concerning the practical application of international legal standards, IOM contributed to the
review of States’ implementation of international human rights instruments carried out by the United
Nations treaty bodies, as well as supported States in the review of migration-related legislation (e.g.,
the Comoros and Honduras). IOM also contributed to advancing knowledge and research on
international migration law by conducting legal research and developing articles and notes on various
topics, and regularly running information sessions on various topics for university and secondary
school students.

Whole-of-society approach

129. IOM engages with a broad range of partners as part of its whole-of-society approach, forging
partnerships with intergovernmental organizations, civil society, the media and the private sector,
among others. In 2020, IOM concluded eight cooperation agreements at the global level with other
international organizations.

130. IOM’s work with intergovernmental organizations has a considerable impact on programming,
contributing to improving IOM’s profile at regional level; cooperation on project implementation;
access to funding; cooperation among working groups on policy, legislation and strategy development;
and access to different areas and communities. In 2020, 78 IOM offices cooperated with non-United
Nations intergovernmental organizations, such as the African Union, the Council of Europe and
International Committee of the Red Cross. For example, in Thailand, through the Document
Examination Support Center initiative, IOM and INTERPOL worked to harmonize the provision of
border management and technological solutions to support greater efficiency in law enforcement
operations to address transnational organized crime.

131. CSOs represent the largest proportion of IOM implementing partners, and this cooperation
spans a broad range of migration issues at the local, national, regional, and global levels. In 2020,
94 per cent of IOM offices worked closely with civil society, mostly NGOs at local and international
level, but also with researchers, research institutions, media, diaspora organizations, local societies of
the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, trade unions and professional associations,
and philanthropic foundations and funds. IOM offices rely on civil society to enhance outreach and
access to beneficiaries and communities, raise local/grass-roots awareness, build the capacity of civil
society and enable more informed and effective programming.

132. In 2020, IOM Headquarters organized virtual information-sharing sessions with civil society
interlocutors on topics such as the implications of the COVID-19 pandemic on migration, the
environment and climate change, and progress in the implementation of the Global Compact for Safe,
Orderly and Regular Migration. To further strengthen and expand IOM’s engagement with civil society,
a new institution-wide civil society engagement framework was finalized.

133. IOM also continued to engage further with the private sector over the reporting period, with
84 offices actively engaging with the private sector in over 80 countries. The engagements included
partnerships and collaborations for knowledge and information exchange, the provision of expertise,
policy dialogues, joint collaboration for innovation, advocacy, and grant-based donations for IOM’s
programmatic priorities.

134. For example, in China, IOM partnered with The Mekong Club, an association of businesses
committed to fighting modern slavery based in Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China, to
-----------------------Page 39 End-----------------------

C/112/INF/1
Page 32


co-host a webinar on Responsible Recruitment During Covid-19: Lessons from Industry. IOM made a
strong call to action to commit to ethical recruitment alongside partners such as Apple and World Wise
Foods. In Trinidad and Tobago, in partnership with its non-profit partner, USA for IOM, and Citibank
(Trinidad & Tobago) Limited, IOM distributed 160 electronic tablets to primary schools and other
organizations in February. This effort to narrow the digital learning gap created by the COVID-19
pandemic was part of a larger initiative in response to the pandemic, which also included the
distribution of food and hygiene kits to migrants and nationals of Trinidad and Tobago in rural and
coastal communities.

135. IOM also carried out online fundraising campaigns to tap into the individual giving market, by
promoting brand credibility and showcasing IOM’s impact on the ground. In 2020, IOM launched five
individual giving campaigns through online mass marketing (two diaspora giving campaigns for
South Africa and Somalia; a global appeal for the COVID-19 response; a Ramadan giving campaign;
and the World Humanitarian Day Real-Life Heroes campaign), raising a total of USD 26,925.81
from 283 online donors. Content collected from over 25 country offices was packaged into social media
campaigns for global audiences in Arabic, English, French and Spanish, reaching a digital audience of
nearly 14.3 million people.

Data and evidence

136. IOM’s priorities and strategic course on migration data until 2025 are set out in the IOM
Migration Data Strategy, which was finalized and presented to the membership in 2020, and is aligned
with the data strategy of the Secretary-General of the United Nations. One of IOM’s commitments is
to serve Member States and the international community as the lead reference for data and evidence
on migration, in line with the IOM Data Protection Principles. To this effect, IOM endeavours to
strengthen the global evidence base on migration and to develop the capacity of Member States and
other partners on migration data, including in relation to its production and analysis. In addition, IOM
is committed to conducting and supporting analysis and research that informs migration policy and
practice, while contributing to the broader understanding of migration patterns and processes.

137. In 2020, as part of the strategy development process, a task force on data quality control set
up within the IOM Data Steering Group finalized its work and produced a set of recommendations and
tools to enhance quality control and consistency of migration data shared or published beyond IOM.

138. During the reporting period, 130 IOM offices (77%) reported that they had collected migration
data for external use. The most common type of data collection was related to different instruments
of DTM, but the collection of data related to assisted voluntary return and reintegration and other data
using MiMOSA was also common. In 2020, 102 IOM offices (60%) built the capacity of external partners
in migration data for different target audiences. Of these, 32 were in Africa, 20 were in Eastern and
South-Eastern Europe, Central Asia and the European Economic Area, and 18 were in Asia and the
Pacific.

139. In 2020, the Global Migration Data Analysis Centre continued to improve migration data on
safe and orderly migration. Selected highlights from 2020 include co-organizing the second
International Forum on Migration Statistics in Cairo with OECD and the United Nations Department of
Economic and Social Affairs; strengthening existing initiatives, including the Global Migration Data
Portal, in particular at the regional level, in cooperation with the regional offices and the Big Data for
Migration Alliance; and delivering capacity-building activities, including in collaboration with the
African Union. The Centre also published several policy-relevant publications, including Migration in
West and North Africa and across the Mediterranean; Migration Governance Indicators: A Global
Perspective; and a report on migration scenarios and forecasting. It also started new research on data
disaggregation and the impact of migrant deaths and disappearances on families left behind.

                                                                                              C/112/INF/1
                                                                                                  Page 33


140. IOM is working to establish and disseminate the first standards and best practices on the
collection, management, and safe use of human trafficking administrative data. These efforts comprise
the development of data standards and practical guidance for government agencies, in collaboration
with the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime; and of a standard-compliant information
management toolkit and guidance for CSOs active in the area of counter-trafficking. The standards for
government agencies are expected to be published in September 2021.

141. A preliminary version of the information management standards, toolkit and guidance can be
accessed on Github. By the end of 2020, the Counter-Trafficking Data Collaborative was receiving on
average 8,000 unique users every month from 183 countries and territories. This is an increase from
6,000 unique monthly users at the end of 2019 (175 countries and territories).

142. IOM, together with OCHA and UNHCR, also co-led the development of the IASC Operational
Guidance on Data Responsibility in Humanitarian Action. This system-wide operational guidance,
which is a first, provides concrete actions for data responsibility in all phases of humanitarian action.
In addition, the Humanitarian Data Science and Ethics Group, coordinated jointly by IOM and the Data
Science Initiative of the City of the Hague, developed and launched the Decision Tree for Ethical
Humanitarian Data Science. The Decision Tree is an online interactive tool based upon the Group’s
Ethical Framework and aims to provide a set of ethical and practical guidelines for humanitarian data
collectors, users and stakeholders to consider when applying data science in humanitarian work.

143. IOM has been collaborating with Microsoft Research to develop new ways of anonymizing
human trafficking data for a public audience. The new technical solution, based on modelling and
generation of synthetic microdata, allows the publication of an unredacted, synthetic dataset that
exhibits the same properties as the original, sensitive case dataset.

144. After the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, IOM was also among the first to publish
research and analysis on the impacts of COVID-19 on migration and migrants to improve the
understanding of its implications and inform policies and programmes. In addition to the COVID-19
Analytical Snapshots mentioned in Box 7, during 2020, IOM published 14 short “think pieces” on
COVID-19 and the transformation of migration and mobility globally. Partnership was a central aspect
of IOM’s COVID-19 response to ensure that all affected populations were reached and to minimize
duplication. A key example was the joint IOM–WFP study on the implication of COVID-19 for food
security, migration, displacement and livelihoods. The report was the first global-level collaboration of
its kind between the two agencies.

145. In 2020, IOM continued to prioritize accessibility of research and analysis to the benefit of its
Member States and other stakeholders in order to better inform migration policies and programmes
and, more generally, improve understanding of migration. In 2020, the latest edition of the
Organization’s flagship publication, the World Migration Report 2020, was made available in all official
languages of the United Nations, in addition to key chapters translated into German, Portuguese,
Swahili and Turkish. A total of 130 country offices also published research, analysis or assessment
reports in different languages for external distribution.

146. In addition, in 2020, the IOM Publications Platform made an additional 245 IOM publications
freely available online, the majority in the three IOM official languages, but also in other official United
Nations languages and other languages. As of the end of 2020, the Platform contained 2,247 electronic
publications in 34 different languages. One of IOM’s flagship publications in 2020 was the first
Africa Migration Report: Challenging the Narrative, which was co-written with the African Union
Commission and deconstructs the realities of migration within and across Africa.

INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND ORGANIZATIONAL EFFECTIVENESS

147. Around the world, IOM continued to have a profound impact on the beneficiaries it assists,
and on wider societies, whose resilience it seeks to strengthen. However, IOM also sought to
strengthen itself as an institution, in line with the ambitions of the IOM Strategic Vision 2019-2023,
and the accompanying Internal Governance Framework. Within the framework of their regional
strategies, the nine regional offices continued to perform a consolidated role in overseeing, planning
and coordinating IOM functions and supporting country offices during the full project cycle within their
respective regions, especially in areas of policy support and guidance, donor liaison and
communications, and capacity-building support.

148. To continuously improve itself, the Organization needs to demonstrate high levels of internal
performance and gains in internal efficiencies that will be sustained for years to come. This section
highlights selected elements of institutional development in 2020, while demonstrating how IOM is
strengthening its organizational effectiveness and investing in a modern and fit-for-purpose internal
governance system to meet the demands of the future.

149. The total combined revenue of the Organization, comprising assessed contributions, voluntary
contributions and other income, increased by 3 per cent compared with 2019 and reached USD 2,182.7
million in 2020. The assessed contributions from Member States continued to represent a small
proportion of IOM’s funding structure, accounting for less than 3 per cent of consolidated revenue for
2020. The annual financial results for 2020 showed a 4 per cent increase in the combined total
expenditure compared with 2019, with the total expenses reaching USD 2,178.0 million, meeting the
Organization’s annual budget target.

                               Total revenue and expenditure for 2020




150. Throughout 2020, IOM continued to engage with donors to increase predictable, multi-
year unearmarked contributions, so as to allow IOM to implement critical strategic and institutional
initiatives. At the end of the reporting period, a total of USD 31.3 million in voluntary unearmarked
contributions had been received from 13 donors (Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Ireland, Netherlands,
Norway, Philippines, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom, United States of America).
This flexible funding has been instrumental for the implementation of important reforms under the
Internal Governance Framework and strategic initiatives outlined in the Strategic Vision. In an effort
to increase the level of unearmarked funding, IOM is looking into ways to take a more results-oriented
approach to the management of unearmarked contributions in line with overall strategic results and
-----------------------Page 42 End-----------------------

                                                                                                         C/112/INF/1
                                                                                                             Page 35


organizational effectiveness frameworks. This approach will enable IOM to allocate unearmarked
contributions more strategically. 10

151. IOM continued to explore forward-looking and proactive resource mobilization and donor
liaison mechanisms as important contributors to organizational effectiveness. To this effect, IOM also
launched five key funding appeals: the IOM Global Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan for
COVID-19; the IOM Asia and the Pacific Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan for COVID-19; the
IOM Flash Appeal for Cambodia Flood Response; the IOM Lebanon Appeal for the Beirut Port
Explosions; and the IOM Flash Appeal for Humanitarian Support for Rohingya in Indonesia.
Furthermore, IOM’s Global Crisis Response Platform, which was launched in February 2020, also
served as an institutional online resource mobilization and communication tool for crisis response.
During 2020, 40 crisis response plans were developed in the Platform in collaboration with country
and regional offices.

152. Furthermore, the Organization completed the design phase and launched the development of
a beneficiary and distribution management system. Once fully developed, this new system will improve
the Organization’s accountability and effectiveness by enabling country offices to monitor, track and
report on how donor contributions were distributed to individual recipients of IOM’s humanitarian
assistance.

153. In 2020, no new Member States joined the Organization; total membership therefore
remained at 173 Member States. IOM observers were joined by one State, namely Malaysia. By the
end of 2020, there were a total of 164 IOM observers: nine observer States, 33 organs and
organizations of the United Nations, 45 intergovernmental organizations and 77 other organizations.

Policy capacity and knowledge management

154. IOM seeks to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of IOM operations by ensuring that
resources and systems are in place to enhance policy capacity in line with operational needs and in
response to evolving trends.

155. During 2020, IOM quickly reflected on the key policy implications of the pandemic, and
produced a range of policy briefs, issue briefs, and guidance to support colleagues in the field, many
of which are referenced in this report. Notably, IOM produced an institutional statement on COVID-19
and mobility in May 2020, which was subsequently updated in March 2021, highlighting the full range
of policy and operational concerns in a single document. IOM contributed to United Nations
deliberations on the impacts of the pandemic, notably providing input to the United Nations Secretary
General’s Policy Brief on COVID-19 and People on the Move in June 2020.

156. The COVID-19 pandemic has only heightened the need to develop and utilize effective
knowledge management tools. During the year, IOM created the COVID-19 Guidance and Toolkit for
Mental Health and Psychosocial Support (MHPSS) Teams. This document – available in English, French
and Spanish – includes best and promising practices and tools related to mental health and
psychosocial support in response to the COVID-19 crisis. IOM also developed the Emergency
Preparedness Dashboard, which aims to identify countries most at risk and in need of support for
preparedness activities, as well as to facilitate knowledge management and the sharing of information
on contingency planning. This tool is updated every six months, and currently covers 45 countries and
around 150 risks.

Page 36


157. Effective knowledge management is key for building and leveraging institutional policy
capacity, and a number of tools have been developed to harness this. In September 2020, IOM
launched the Migration Policy Repository, which aims to enhance access for IOM staff to information
about IOM’s policy activities and support the provision of technical advice on migration policy
development by missions to governments and stakeholders. The Repository already houses
information on close to 400 policy activities from all nine IOM regions, with additional entries being
added on a regular basis, and will be made accessible to the public through the United Nations
Migration Network Hub.

158. To help IOM staff to identify and articulate the linkages between the main migration-related
global frameworks in the context of the United Nations development system reform and Global
Compact implementation, in 2020, the Organization piloted an e-learning training course on leveraging
global frameworks through policy and programming. The training course covers the Global Compact,
the SDGs, and MiGOF, and will be rolled out across the Organization. The training will build capacity
across IOM to provide effective support to UNCTs and governments on Global Compact
implementation through high-quality policy advice.

159. During the reporting period, IOM revamped its Environmental Migration Portal. The Portal was
launched in 2015 and aims to provide up-to-date information on key policy processes and
developments, capacity-building efforts, research and publications, and operational projects
addressing migration, environment, and climate change issues. IOM also hosted a series of blog posts
on the COVID-19 pandemic, migration and the environment, written by IOM colleagues and external
contributors.

160. Through the IOM Development Fund, the Organization conducted reviews of projects on
counter-trafficking and protection/assistance for vulnerable migrant undertaken between 2015 and
2019; regularization projects undertaken between 2001 and 2019; and innovation initiatives
undertaken between 2014 and 2019. The reviews are intended to spotlight successful projects and to
identify best practices, challenges and trends to consider when designing and implementing future
projects. The review of innovation initiatives has been issued as a booklet, containing information on
over 60 projects, to serve as a resource and reference for IOM offices, to foster the exchange of
experiences of project implementation across regions and thematic areas and to strengthen
innovation throughout the Organization.

161. IOM launched the Global Stocks Request Tracking System in September 2020. The system
allows IOM staff to make enquiries on stock availability, place stock withdrawal requests and track
delivery from global warehouses to field missions, aiming to reduce the length of administrative
processes while increasing the visibility of requests and available global stocks.

162. In 2020, further efforts were made to analyse reintegration outcomes and contribute to
evidence-based programming. One example is the comparative analysis entitled Mentoring Returnees:
Study on Reintegration Outcomes Through a Comparative Lens. The study, conducted in collaboration
with the Samuel Hall think tank and the University of Sussex, analysed the outcomes of reintegration
in three countries – Guinea, Morocco and Senegal – and combined the results with data analyses from
14 additional countries.

163. The EU–IOM Knowledge Management Hub, which aims to strengthen learning across return
and reintegration programmes, launched a series of “knowledge bites” on sustainable reintegration,
presenting findings on sustainable reintegration outcomes. It also published nine factsheets on good,
promising and innovative reintegration practices that had been implemented in Burkina Faso, Guinea,
Iraq, Mali, Morocco, the Netherlands and Somalia.

                                                                                          C/112/INF/1
                                                                                              Page 37


164. To harness the potential of technology to expand IOM’s capacity-building and knowledge-
sharing outreach and impact on international migration law, IOM created a community of practice and
started developing new learning tools. In addition, a one-stop-shop knowledge platform and a
community of practice related to AAP, the latter with 188 members, were also established to foster
the exchange of good practices, tools and communication products.

Media and communications

165. Throughout the reporting period, IOM maintained high visibility to ensure that it speaks to and
represents all migrants around the world through both its media and community engagement
activities.

166. IOM’s global website, the digital gateway to the Organization, received its first investment in
many years in the last quarter of 2020, allowing for a redefinition of the information architecture and
navigation wireframes, usability testing and technical assessment of fixes needed prior to the launch
of the new website and roll-out at the regional and country office level in the second quarter of 2021.
Total page views grew by 20 per cent to 2.4 million, driven in part by the new look of the website and
the redefined approach to news and feature content production, more detail on which can be found
below.

167. In September 2020, IOM piloted a new approach to news visibility, focusing on breaking news,
consistent advocacy messaging on key issues and partnerships with other United Nations agencies,
while setting a higher standard for content flow. The strategic goal was to increase readership, to
leverage news media coverage of IOM policy positions and advocacy points to drive consumers to the
global website, thus enhancing overall visibility. A review of website analytics reveals a significant
uptick in readership measured as clicks to news and feature stories from 150,000 in 2019 to over
180,000 for the last quarter of 2020.

168. On International Migrants Day 2020, the Organization launched its latest strategic initiative to
improve the quality and quantity of accurate, diverse, and balanced media reporting about migration,
and support constructive public conversation and dialogue: the Global Migration Media Academy.
Co-financed by the IOM Development Fund and Irish Aid, the Global Migration Media Academy will
provide journalism students with a versatile e-learning platform with accredited universities in its
target countries based on an IOM-validated foundation curriculum developed by its partners at the
National University of Ireland. The project seeks to improve media reporting standards by supporting
ethical, accurate and balanced reporting on migration.

169. Social media in all its forms has played a central role supporting IOM’s Strategic Vision, shaping
public awareness of the IOM brand, and the Organization’s activities and advocacy, policy and data
work. Over the course of 2020, IOM’s global social media accounts managed from Headquarters saw
a three-fold increase in followers to three million. The number of followers of regional office and
country office social media accounts increased to 2 million.

170. Two new corporate accounts, on TikTok and Viber Communities, targeting youth
demographics were successfully launched during 2020; by the end of the year, these IOM pages were
ranked third and fourth, respectively, among the more than 100 international organizations tracked
globally by Twiplomacy, opening up IOM messaging and advocacy to entirely new audiences.

Results-based management

171. During the year, IOM reinforced results-based management at the institutional level, with the
aim of strengthening strategy development and planning capacities and presenting the Organization’s
-----------------------Page 45 End-----------------------

C/112/INF/1
Page 38


achievements at the country, regional and global levels using an institution-wide reporting
methodology, with the online institutional questionnaire serving as the central reporting system. The
participation rate for this tool reached 98 per cent in 2020 and the data were used for the preparation
of the present report.

172. Notably, in 2020, through a participatory and collaborative process, and following a series of
consultations and drafting sessions with staff from Headquarters and the regional offices that drew on
key elements from the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration, the SDGs, MiGOF, and
regional institutional strategies, the Organization also completed a draft of the global IOM Strategic
Results Framework, which includes four institutional objectives. The Framework provides a basis to
measure progress towards the IOM Strategic Vision and will help to address wider SDG and other
reporting requirements. During the reporting period, IOM also launched a “wizard” in PRIMA, which
offers project developers and reporting officers a streamlined tool to boost systematic and coherent
reporting related to the SDGs and the Global Compact. This will help IOM to meet its new SDG-related
reporting requirements, for instance to the Chief Executives Board for Coordination, in line its with
commitments under the Funding Compact. It will also strengthen IOM’s internal capacity to report on
its efforts to support implementation of the Global Compact, including through the United Nations
Network on Migration and support to Member States.

173. Since joining the United Nations system in 2016, IOM has progressively enhanced its strategic
and results-based management capacities at the project, country, regional and global level. As a result
of these efforts, and its increasing prominence, IOM was also appointed as co-chair of the United
Nations Strategic Planning Network for 2020 and 2021. Through this Network, the Organization has
promoted knowledge-sharing and learning across United Nations agencies, further supporting a
transition towards a results-based management 2.0 framework, focused on systematic learning and
adaptation by using results and evidence to inform decision-making processes at all levels in IOM.

Monitoring and evaluation

174. A strong monitoring and evaluation culture within the Organization requires a dedicated
commitment to capacity-building for these functions, to maintain accountability and to streamline
reporting to donors. These are core elements of the IOM Monitoring and Evaluation strategies for the
periods 2018-2020 and 2021-2023, developed under the auspices of the Internal Governance
Framework, the latter of which was developed using a collaborative approach during 2020.

175. As part of the Organization’s efforts to improve quality assurance in evaluation, in 2020, IOM
published the results of a meta-evaluation, which reviewed the quality of IOM evaluation reports
between 2017 and 2019. The meta-evaluation concluded that the quality of evaluations has
progressively improved each year. Thirty per cent of the reports conducted in 2017 did not meet the
minimum quality requirements; this figure decreased to 18 per cent in 2018 and 14 per cent in 2019.
The report concludes that this is due in part to the guidance provided by IOM Headquarters on
evaluation, and also due to its training activities to develop a strong foundation of knowledge among
IOM staff who manage and conduct evaluations.

176. IOM continued to successfully roll out the Monitoring and Evaluation e-learning course,
training a total of 145 staff from 60 separate IOM offices (including country and regional offices and
Headquarters) by end of the year. The participants showed a 20 per cent increase in knowledge after
completing the course. The evaluation function of the Office of the Inspector General provided
monitoring and evaluation technical support on remote monitoring to two operations (Libya and Syrian
Arab Republic) in order to strengthen reporting.
-----------------------Page 46 End-----------------------

                                                                                            C/112/INF/1
                                                                                                Page 39


177. Besides the efforts focused on building the capacity of IOM staff, the evaluation function of
the Office of the Inspector General and regional monitoring and evaluation officers develop essential
institutional and corporate guidance to support the monitoring and evaluation activities of IOM offices
worldwide, and provide technical guidance as required. During 2020, guidance was developed on
ensuring the continuity of monitoring and evaluation interventions during the COVID-19 pandemic and
technical advice was provided on the development of a global results framework for IOM’s response
to the pandemic. During the collaborative process to develop the strategy for the period 2021–2023,
the value of the guidance and capacity-building support provided, together with the important work
of regional monitoring and evaluation officers, was highlighted by many participants.

178. Over the reporting period, a total of 50 decentralized evaluations (19 internal and 31 external)
and 5 centralized evaluations were registered. IOM reinforced the use of findings to shape the work it
does. All evaluations and evaluation briefs – together with technical guidance on performing
evaluations – are available in the IOM Evaluation Repository, which was made accessible to external
users in 2020.

179. One hundred and five offices reported using information derived from evaluations for their
interventions, to learn, to inform project design of either new or follow-up interventions, to identify
the focus of new projects, to improve the frequency of monitoring visits, and to follow up on evaluation
recommendations. Examples of good evaluation-related practices include the Regional Office in Dakar,
where evaluation reports are circulated broadly; the IOM Office in Ecuador, which makes evaluation
reports and briefs available to host governments and other stakeholders; the IOM Office in Zimbabwe,
which established a feedback and complaints mechanism for beneficiaries; and the IOM Office in
Thailand, which holds annual retreats with key national and international staff to discuss respective
achievements and progress, and obtains feedback from key government, civil society or United Nations
partners.

Risk management

180. During a year of unprecedented disruption, the Organization was able to respond to and
proactively manage the business continuity, operational and financial risks associated with the
COVID-19 pandemic. The lessons learned have been considered in risk response plans and have already
resulted in tangible changes to business processes and the assessment of risk at various levels of the
Organization, including with regard to our downstream partners.

181. In 2020, a risk profiling exercise was undertaken for all IOM country offices and proposals
developed to enhance risk management structures. The recommended structures include a
combination of risk focal points, local risk committees and full-time risk and organizational
performance capacity at regional and country office level.

182. IOM country offices vary significantly in size and set-up, with differing levels of financial and
human resource constraints, and often face challenges in adapting and implementing universal
guidance on risk management. While 143 offices reported the active management of project risks in
2020, only 39 offices completed a full country-level risk assessment during the year. The aim of the risk
profiling exercise and the review of risk management structures is to address these challenges and
ensure the development of consistent, yet tailored, risk management structures and approaches for
each category of office. This approach also aims to ensure the appropriate level and regularity of
communication and risk information-sharing between the field, regional offices and Headquarters.

183. At an organizational level, a process has been established to actively manage principal risks.
Risk management is also being embedded into control and process design, as part of the work streams
on strengthening existing business processes and the Business Transformation initiative included in
-----------------------Page 47 End-----------------------

C/112/INF/1
Page 40


the Application of the Internal Governance Framework Work Plan. This will help establish a more
mature risk management process in which Organization-wide risks are managed through embedded
risk-based controls, in addition to providing a mechanism to drive accountability, increased
transparency and improved reporting.

                                      Box 13. Disability inclusion
To raise performance on disability inclusion across the United Nations system, the UNDIS was launched
by the Secretary-General in June 2019. Reporting on UNDIS implementation, using the UNDIS technical
notes, will: enable an assessment of the extent to which disability inclusion is mainstreamed within
the IOM’s work; spotlight good practices; and identify key areas which may require improvement.
IOM’s first UNDIS report was submitted in May 2020 and was compiled by a working group, led by the
Office of the Director General, with contributions from IOM staff from across the Organization.

In 2020, IOM reported small but very encouraging changes in its collective efforts to address disability
inclusion, particularly with regard to the areas of strategic planning and management, consultation
with people with disabilities, reasonable accommodation, joint initiatives, capacity development and
communications. Three key changes can be highlighted. First, the inclusion of disability within the IOM
Strategic Results Framework, which will inform the roll-out of disability inclusive programmes and
projects and country strategic plans, as well as serving to guide wider discussions on diversity and
inclusion. Second, the completion of guidance and a policy on reasonable accommodation, which is
critical to IOM's commitment to creating inclusive and accessible workplaces for employees with
disabilities. Finally, added investment to improve and harmonize capacity-building tools to ensure that
all IOM staff, whether they work with affected populations or not, have a basic understanding of
disability inclusion.

Other developments have been made in IOM operations, particularly within humanitarian settings.
The CCCM team developed consultation guidelines that complement those developed by UNDIS and
are informed by IASC guidelines and other inter-agency processes. These form a solid basis for IOM to
expand to other sectors of activity.

Finally, the IOM leadership once again championed disability inclusion internally and externally by
continuing to support internal discussions to promote disability inclusion, harmonize it with wider
efforts to promote social inclusion, and communicate externally on the importance of the disability in
all areas of its work.

Human resources

Human resources management

184. At the end of 2020, the total number of staff was 16,254, representing an increase of 10 per
cent compared with the end of 2019. Of this total, 1,066 women and 1,119 men belonged to the
international Professional category, and 6,574 women and 7,495 men belonged to the General
Services category (see the annexes for further details). In the international Professional category,
1,116 staff operated in hardship locations (i.e. categories B, C, D and E), representing 29 per cent of
the total international Professional staff. Out of 818 core positions, 706 are filled. Given the total
headcount of 16,524, the ratio of core to total staff is 1 to 23.
-----------------------Page 48 End-----------------------

                                                                                       C/112/INF/1
                                                                                           Page 41


                         Snapshot of gender balance within the Organization




Staff capacity, skills, and training

185. IOM continued to promote an environment that enables the development of staff skills and
capacities and ensures sound performance management, in line with the Organization’s strategic
priorities.

186. A total of 7,573 staff (approximately 45%) undertook at least one training course in 2020, of
which 54 per cent were women and 46 per cent were men. Regarding their location, 99 per cent of
staff trained were based in the field, with the remaining 1 per cent at Headquarters.

187. In total, 284 thematic, programmatic, and cross-cutting online courses and 121 behavioural
and interpersonal courses were recorded in I-Learn, IOM’s learning management system. Of these
courses, 294 were developed by IOM and 111 were from service providers and other United Nations
agencies.

188. To increase IOM managers’ understanding of strategic planning and results-based
management and to help them to recognize the applicability of these topics in their daily work, IOM
continued the delivery of a global training course on strategic thinking and management, which was
developed in collaboration with Harvard Business Publishing. The course helped participants deepen
their understanding of key concepts, such as strategic thinking and planning, change management,
decision-making and process improvement. The course has had a very clear positive impact on IOM’s
strategic thinking and operations, with various staff reporting its relevance in their strategy
development endeavors. Furthermore, staff have also used modules and materials from the course to
kick off process improvement initiatives, such as the Internal Governance Framework work stream on
travel expense claims; to address programme downsizing and re-programming; and to proactively
address the impact of COVID-19 on IOM operations.

189. Furthermore, IOM has also taken concrete steps to promote understanding of protection and
related principles and standards in each of its specialized fields. During the reporting period, IOM
provided training – through webinars and face-to-face training courses – to up to 900 staff from the
Organization and partners on protection and related topics, including housing, land and property;
-----------------------Page 49 End-----------------------

C/112/INF/1
Page 42


disability inclusion; protection mainstreaming; and the use of DTM data for protection programming
and child protection, including the best interest of the child procedure.

190. Training and capacity-building activities related to counter-trafficking in emergencies reached
1,703 individuals (from governments, CSOs, other United Nations agencies, funds and programmes,
research institutions and the private sector) during the reporting period. Of that figure, 395 received
in-person training (244 women and 151 men), and 1,308 (713 women and 595 men) were users who
had registered for the e-learning course entitled Counter-Trafficking in Humanitarian Settings, which
is hosted by IOM. Sixty-two per cent of those registered were external and 38 per cent were IOM staff
(all from country and regional offices).

191. IOM reached and trained over 5,000 staff through online e-learning materials (including an
online library with over 30 books, 10 videos, 10 microlearning videos, and 4 micro affirmation cards),
toolboxes, and webinars on conflict prevention. These materials include three external expert
webinars, four internal webinars, and the Disability Inclusion Toolkit. These courses are all available
globally, and cover topics such as unconscious bias, trust behaviours, difficult conversations, leadership
in crisis, active listening, negotiation principles, and team collaboration and resiliency.

192. Two assessment centres were held for Chief of Mission and Resource Management Officer
roles. Seventy-five internal and external candidates were assessed, of which 53 successfully passed
and 25 have already been appointed to roles in different countries. The last round of Pathways Pool
initiative attracted the interest of 1,025 applicants, over 20 per cent more than in 2019 (845
applicants). More than one third of applicants were nationals of OECD-DAC countries. These numbers
are encouraging and reflect IOM's efforts to identify qualified and diverse candidates to fill critical Chief
of Mission and Resources Management Officer roles worldwide.

Staff welfare

193. Two staff welfare surveys on psychosocial issues were conducted in 2020. The focus of both
surveys was to assess staff concerns, coping strategies, business continuity changes, and the impact of
public health measures and interventions by the IOM leadership. Overall, there were extremely high
levels of concern in key areas such as workload, job insecurity, work stress, home and personal life,
childcare, isolation, personal mental health, anxiety, and other concerns. As a result, IOM expanded
its Staff Welfare Service to support provide psychosocial support to staff during the COVID-19
pandemic. Confidential counselling, educational provision and support network services were made
available. Uptake of all these services increased at least five-fold in 2020 compared with 2019, with
3,335 sessions held with 2,563 staff; 1,879 consultations held with managers; and 215 webinars and
236 well-being sessions attended by 2,792 staff.

194. Principles of staff management take into account the responsibility of the United Nations
global response to “stay and deliver,” along with the moral obligation to respond to the individual
health needs of humanitarian workers, known as duty of care, making IOM accountable for
safeguarding the lives and the well-being of its employees. As of 31 December 2020, the work
of 108 IOM missions had been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, either through direct impacts on
the health of the employees (with 1, 097 employees having contracted COVID-19, 83 of whom had
been hospitalized and 4 of whom had undergone medical evacuations) or through indirect impacts,
such as mandatory lockdowns and quarantine of contact cases (1,125 contacts). General Services staff
were the most affected staff category (76.6%), with the majority of those affected (68.7%) holding
administrative and clerical positions.

195. A robust COVID-19 surveillance and case management system, which encouraged self-
reporting and contact case reporting, was implemented to reduce the impact of the pandemic on the
-----------------------Page 50 End-----------------------

                                                                                            C/112/INF/1
                                                                                                Page 43


workplace and facilitate access to health care. Through its participation in the United Nations Medical
Directors Network, IOM supported the production of the United Nations Medical Directors Risk
Mitigation Plan for COVID-19, which served as the foundation of the IOM occupational response plan,
and the organization of the inter-agency United Nations COVID-19 Medical Evacuation Framework.

196. To expand and facilitate the access of employees and their families to hospitals and to
multilingual high-quality health care, IOM promoted the use of the International SOS Assistance
application and supported the creation of five new agreements with hospitals in countries with poor
access to health-care facilities.

197. Furthermore, regular communication was maintained throughout the year, sharing
educational material, epidemiological updates, and standard operating procedures and guidance with
IOM employees and their families. Missions received guidance related to standard health and safety
measures to implement in workplaces; measures related to specific occupational risks; and actions for
staff with personal medical risks of developing a severe illness that were serving in locations without
adequate health-care facilities (439 staff were advised to relocate). Individual advice and follow-ups
were also provided to 2,749 employees.

Consistent conditions for staff

198. Conditions of service should be consistent for all staff, with them receiving fair and equal
treatment, regardless of their location. IOM has been rolling out the Unified Staff Rules in all countries
of operation for staff in the General Service category, which includes National Officers. By the end of
2020, 74 per cent of General Service staff and National Officers were covered by the Unified Staff Rules.

199. During 2020, the Global Staff Association Committee reached a number of milestones in
supporting staff. Five new National Staff Associations were established in 2020, bringing the total
number to 56. Additionally, the Global Staff Association Committee increased its visibility in 2020 by
engaging in new boards and committees to provide policy inputs that represent staff members’
interests.

Diversity and inclusion and staff representation

200. A workplace that promotes diversity and inclusion enables all staff to contribute to the
Organization and to serve beneficiaries and Member States effectively. IOM is committed to this
principle and has made several efforts to promote it across the Organization.

201. During the reporting period, 169 nationalities were represented in the Organization’s global
workforce. This figure includes 140 nationalities represented at the international Professional level and
89 nationalities at the senior level (P-4 level and above). Progress continued to be made in geographical
diversity at the international level. IOM staff from countries in the global South (countries that are not
OECD/DAC members) represented 79 per cent of the total IOM workforce. Furthermore, 76 per cent
of Member States were represented among international Professional staff, a slight increase from the
previous year (2019: 74%). The Organization constantly liaises with the permanent missions and
governments of non-represented Member States to ensure that their qualified professionals have the
possibility to apply to and be hired by IOM.

Staff security

202. Staff security is of paramount importance, not only to foster a safe work environment, but also
to enable the Organization to effectively deliver its mandate around the world. During the reporting
period, IOM was elected as the Chair for the Standing Committee on Learning and Training and the
-----------------------Page 51 End-----------------------

C/112/INF/1
Page 44


Strategic Communications Working Group of the Inter-Agency Security Management Network. IOM
also has a specialist role in the Network’s discussions on hostage incident management. As a result,
the Organization updated the IOM policy framework on hostage incident management coordination
and expanded its capacity in that area through training programmes. At of the end of 2020, IOM had
a total of 15 staff certified in hostage incident management coordination, ranging from security
professionals to Chiefs of Mission.

203. Furthermore, the Organization continued to have a large worldwide presence to ensure the
best possible care and security for its staff, with a network of seven Regional Field Security Officers,
32 International Field Security Officers, and 104 National Security Officers and Local Security
Assistants.

204. While COVID-19 has halted the delivery of face-to-face security training sessions, IOM took the
opportunity to strengthen its governance and quality control mechanism with the standardization of
the IOM-delivered UNSMS security training courses, such as the Safe and Secure Approaches in Field
Environments (SSAFE) course. IOM remains the only UNSMS organization with a SSAFE curriculum that
is 100 per cent compliant with the updated UNSMS SSAFE standards and regulations. COVID-19 safety
protocols for the delivery of face-to-face security learning programmes were also established for duty
stations that were able resume their security training delivery.

                                 Box 14. Informal conflict resolution

The Office of the Ombudsperson is responsible for addressing work-related issues in an informal,
independent, neutral and impartial, and confidential manner. The Organization understands that only
by developing a culture of addressing conflict in a timely manner can staff reach their full and future
potential.

In 2020, the Office received 445 staff seeking assistance (a 16% increase from 2019). Of the cases
reported, 93 per cent were closed, with 61 per cent of cases resolved, and 10 per cent requiring no
further action. The remaining 29 per cent of cases were classified according to their relevant status.
During the year, the Office produced five periodic reports and one annual report, identifying
17 systemic issues and making recommendations to increase organizational effectiveness.

The Office also continued the expansion of its network of respectful workplace focal points by training
an additional 43 focal points (16 men, 27 women), increasing the total number of focal points to more
than 120 in 73 country offices, while maintaining gender parity. These additional focal points increased
local accessibility by 13 per cent, meaning that 79 per cent of all staff and non-staff (consultants and
interns) worldwide can find a focal point in their respective country offices.
The network multiplies the reach of the Office of the Ombudsperson, with each focal point
representing a local access point to the informal conflict resolution system, thereby enabling issues to
be addressed in a timely manner, which in turn reduces the risk of escalated conflicts and increases
productivity, while allowing IOM personnel to take ownership of their conflict. The implementation of
this concept saves the Organization substantial financial resources.

In 2020, the Office also expanded its online library and conflict resolution resources to include more
than 30 new e-books and audiobooks, and held three expert-led webinars and three Office-led
webinars on relevant conflict resolution topics. It also added a new online video class which is
accessible to all staff. Through these means, more than 5,000 staff were reached and trained in conflict
management skills.
-----------------------Page 52 End-----------------------

                                                                                            C/112/INF/1
                                                                                                Page 45


Transparency and accountability

205. IOM maintains its commitment to transparency and accountability in both its programmatic
work and its internal organizational effectiveness. As a member of IATI since March 2017, IOM began
publishing its organizational and activity data in the IATI registry in February 2018, meeting its
obligations as an IATI member. Since June 2020, IOM has increased its publication frequency and is
now a monthly publisher. Additionally, IOM expanded its activity dataset to include the gender policy
marker, geographical coordinates and country location data and includes all appeal codes, including
the Humanitarian Response Plan appeals and COVID-19-related appeals. The Organization also rolled
out the internal IATI Transparency Portal to all country offices, as anticipated in 2019. The number of
projects reported in IATI rose to 2,084 and IOM’s score at the end of 2020 was 62 on the IATI
dashboard. This represents a 13 per cent improvement from the 2019 score.

206. The Organization continues to coordinate efforts among the projects which share common
reporting requirements and to create synergies between its IATI reporting and reporting for the United
Nations, for example to the United Nations System Chief Executives Board for Coordination and
the 1 per cent coordination levy. In addition, the IATI team has been working closely with the Global
Crisis Response Platform, Sales Force, PRISM and PRIMA teams to ensure that the collection and
reporting of master data is fit-for-purpose and uniform across all platforms.

207. During 2020, 20,663 agreements/contracts were handled by the Office of Legal Affairs
worldwide, of which approximately 1,444 were donor/funding agreements. The pilot phase for
Organization’s contract life cycle software – CAFE (contract automation, filing and execution) – was
extended to five additional country offices in 2020, meaning a total of seven country offices have been
testing the system. CAFE allows offices to fast-track the contracting process with tailor-made
agreements and automated coordination functions.

Standards of conduct

208. All persons employed by or working for IOM must adhere to the IOM Standards of Conduct
and all instructions issued by the Organization. The Policy for a Respectful Working Environment
stipulates that all staff members have the right to a workplace free of harassment, which IOM has a
duty to provide. IOM also has a policy of zero tolerance for sexual exploitation and abuse.

209. By the end of the year, approximately 19,400 staff had completed the mandatory e-learning
course on ethics and conduct. The course, launched in 2017, includes topics such as protection from
and response to sexual exploitation and abuse, and corruption. In addition, 2,408 staff received
facilitated (live or webinar) training during the year, in English, French and Spanish.

210. IOM continued to demonstrate its commitment to the highest standards of ethics and conduct.
Over the reporting period, 957 employees declared cases of potential conflict of interest (e.g. outside
activities, gifts, close relatives), thereby ensuring that the Organization was better prepared to address
potential conflicts of interest in a timely manner.

                                 Box 15. Environmental sustainability

In 2020, though its global Environmental Sustainability Programme – which was launched in 2017 and
is fully aligned with Strategy for Sustainability Management in the United Nations System 2020–2030
– IOM continued to improve its track record on environmental sustainability, both institutionally and
at field level, with the objective of strengthening internal environmental management capacity.
-----------------------Page 53 End-----------------------

C/112/INF/1

In 2020, IOM rolled out the global environmental inventories for the second time, measuring levels of
greenhouse gas emissions, water usage and waste in individual IOM facilities and operations. Based
on carbon footprinting, IOM became climate neutral for the first time ever. In addition, several sector-
wide networks highlighted IOM’s sustainability initiatives as good practices. During 2020, IOM also
launched a consultation process for the development of the first ever Organization-wide
environmental sustainability strategy.

IOM continued to engage in global initiatives linked to environmental sustainability in migration
management and humanitarian assistance to facilitate the deployment of environmentally sustainable
practices, serving, inter alia, as a member of the United Nations Greening the Blue Initiative and the
Steering Group of the Global Platform of Action on Sustainable Energy in Displacement Settings.

In line with the IOM’s “cloud first” ICT strategy, the Organization implemented several initiatives using
cloud technologies that provide a standardized, scalable, secure and optimized operational
environment. In 2020, IOM migrated over 25,000 mailboxes from on-premises Microsoft Exchange
servers to Exchange Online. According to Microsoft’s estimates, Exchange Online is 81 per cent more
energy efficient than Microsoft Exchange, which is deployed in traditional enterprise data centres.11 In
addition Microsoft Cloud uses renewable electricity for more than 95 per cent of its consumption,
which includes the data centres that power IOM’s Exchange Online service. When taking into account
renewable energy use, Microsoft estimates that carbon emissions from Exchange Online are 97 per
cent lower than on-site solutions. 12

Data protection

211. Data protection continued to be a key priority in 2020, ensuring that the Organization is
equipped to act in an increasingly information- and technology-led programmatic environment that is
intrinsically linked with the processing of personal data, in line with the IOM Data Protection Principles.
To this end, approximately 290 IOM personnel were trained on data protection through either face-
to-face or remote sessions, and an additional 230 IOM personnel were reached through specific
webinars on the occasion of Data Protection Day in January 2020. Personal data mapping is also being
updated by IOM offices around the world. Furthermore, a dedicated thematic page on data protection
was produced for the Global Migration Data Portal.

Procurement and supply chain effectiveness

212. Strengthening the Organization’s procurement and supply chain is a key institutional priority
and is embedded in the Internal Governance Framework reform process. To this end, many new
initiatives were started in 2020 to make procurement more streamlined and operational, boosting
both efficiency and value for money, while maintaining high levels of accountability. For example, IOM
expanded collaboration on service delivery with United Nations bodies, working with United Nations
logistics services on the use of COVID-19-related global transportation services and joint procurement.
In addition, 107 long-term agreements were in place by the end of December 2020.

213. Administrative processes were also reviewed to identify opportunities to improve service
levels and the speed of decision-making and increase efficiency gains. For example, IOM engaged the
Fritz Institute to map procurement and supply business processes. Moreover, IOM launched a global
fleet data review and analysis project to identify ways of improving effectiveness. Significant efforts
are being invested in the review of administrative processes, as well in changes and innovations that
would have a more immediate impact.

Privileges and immunities

214. Privileges and immunities ensure that the Organization and its staff have operational
independence. By the end of 2020, 101 of the 185 Member States, observer States and places where
IOM has activities granted IOM full privileges and immunities, i.e., privileges and immunities meeting
the criteria contained in Council Resolution No. 1266 of 26 November 2013 on improving the privileges
and immunities granted to the Organization by States. Ninety-nine are Member States and two are
observer States. This means that 74 Member States, 6 observer States, and 4 places where IOM has
activities do not grant IOM privileges and immunities meeting the criteria contained in the Resolution
No. 1266. Efforts continued to negotiate better privileges and immunities for the Organization
worldwide in accordance with Council Resolution No. 1266.
