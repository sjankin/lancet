The ASEAN Socio-Cultural Community pillar
made substantial progress in enhancing the
well-being of ASEAN’s peoples, notably through
the forging of the “ASEAN Consensus on the
Protection and Promotion of the Rights of Migrant
Workers.” Separately, declarations covering the
promotion of a region-wide culture of prevention,
gender-responsive     implementation       of   the
ASEAN Community Vision 2025 and the UN
Sustainable Development Goals, anti-microbial
resistance, ending malnutrition, and disaster health
management, were issued during the past year. On
climate change, plans are underway to convene
a special ministerial meeting and a stakeholder
partnership conference this year.

I am glad to note that our progress to date has been
achieved with the support from robust monitoring
and evaluation frameworks as well as engagement
mechanisms with multiple stakeholders including
the business community and development
partners.

The theme of “Resilient and Innovative” under
Singapore’s Chairmanship in 2018 is fitting in
continuing the momentum of ASEAN Community

regional resilience. Going forward, ASEAN will
continue to work towards its long term vision, i.e.,
by building the region’s readiness for megatrends
like the Fourth Industrial Revolution, and resilience
towards challenges such as inequality and climate
change. The ultimate aim shall be to build an
ASEAN Community that offers security, prosperity,
and benefits to its peoples, and one where its
citizens embrace the regional identity with pride.
