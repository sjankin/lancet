                    President’s foreword




                    A year of change
                    IFAD’s mission is to end hunger and poverty around the
                    world by helping smallholder farmers increase their own
                    prosperity. Our task remains as urgent as ever. An estimated
                    736 million people live on less than US$1.90 a day and
                    almost 80 per cent are in rural areas. Progress in reducing
                    rural hunger has stalled. Today, nearly 821 million people
                    suffer chronic undernutrition – up 34 million since 2014.
                    At the same time, climate change is putting pressure on farmers
                    around the world and is one of the leading causes of severe food crises.
                    The number of extreme climate-related disasters has doubled since the
                    early 1990s, and it is estimated that up to one billion people could be
                    displaced by climate change and environmental pressures.

                    The year 2018, as the last year of the IFAD10 replenishment period, was
                    key to preparing the Fund in a variety of ways for our ambitious plan to
                    deliver faster, better and on a larger scale. IFAD is determined to increase
                    its impact, and has made innovation a priority to scale up its reach
                    and effectiveness.

                    In line with the reforms being carried out across the United Nations
                    system, 2018 was also a year of profound change at IFAD. We started to
                    implement the reforms introduced in 2017 to make the Fund fit to tackle
                    existing and future challenges and to fully contribute to the 2030 Agenda
                    for Sustainable Development.

    Seeking out new resources
    While core contributions from Member States will remain
    the bedrock of IFAD’s financing, we plan to enhance
    our capacity to leverage our existing assets through a
    proper capital adequacy framework. To strengthen our
    financial architecture, in 2018 we started to implement the
    recommendations from the Independent Office of Evaluation
    and the independent review of IFAD’s risk management.
    Substantial effort went into strengthening IFAD’s overall
    risk management and internal control framework. Thus, the
    groundwork is being laid for starting the credit-rating process.
    This year, we also took a decisive step to ensure the implementation
    readiness and early start of projects. In December 2018, our Executive
    Board approved the creation of new Faster Implementation of Project
    Start-up (FIPS) instruments. The Project Pre-Financing Facility (PFF) will
    give borrowers advance access to funds related to loan projects to provide
    sufficient liquidity to begin preparation activities prior to approval and
    entry into force of the financing agreement. The Technical Assistance for
    Project Start-up Facility (TAPS) will provide grants aimed specifically
    at the needs of lower-income countries, countries with the most
    fragile situations, and small-island developing states, and the capacity
    constraints they face.

    The setting up of the Agri-Business Capital Fund, which aims at
    stimulating private-sector investments in rural areas, was among the
    year’s main achievements. The ABC Fund is an independent impact
    fund that will invest in small and medium-sized enterprises in rural
    areas and help to create jobs, in particular for young people and women.
    In December, we signed an agreement with the European Union
    for EUR 45 million for the ABC Fund, adding to the EUR 5 million
    committed by Luxembourg and the EUR 4.5 million committed by the
    Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa.

    One of the greatest challenges facing smallholder farmers is the impact
    of climate change. As a further enhancement of our ability to support
    them in this area, IFAD obtained accreditation to the Green Climate
    Fund, enabling us to access resources to invest in low-emission and
    climate-resilient agriculture.

functions to enhance institutional effectiveness.
Implementation of these changes is ongoing.

                       Focusing on delivery
                       Transforming rural areas into dynamic
                       and prosperous places requires tackling
                       a number of cross-cutting challenges,
                       such as improving nutrition, empowering
                       rural women and girls, offering work

completed              It also developed its first youth action
                       plan. While mainstreaming these
                       priorities in all our operations, we are
                       working to develop innovative and
                       transformative approaches.
                       For programme delivery, 2018 was a pivotal year.
                       With the disbursement of US$1.14 billion in 2018,
                       we completed delivery of our IFAD10 programme
                       of loans and grants (2016-2018), which totalled
                       US$3.3 billion.

                       While delivery is fundamental, it is equally
                       important that we achieve and document results.
                       As part of its impact assessment reporting, IFAD
                       has committed to conducting impact assessments
                       of 15 per cent of its portfolio and measuring the
                       overall impact of its investments. This approach
                       is unique among international organizations.
                       In 2018, 17 impact assessments were completed
                       or close to completion. They showed significant
                       results when comparing project beneficiaries with
                       non-beneficiaries.

                    Looking ahead




                    Our work in 2018 has provided a solid basis for the
                    upcoming IFAD11 period. Going forward, we will continue
                    implementing reforms. We plan to deliver a markedly higher
                    programme of loans and grants, and we will begin the
                    preparatory work for the IFAD12 Replenishment Consultations
                    to ensure our funding from 2022 to 2024.
                    The combination of reforms of the way IFAD works, and the expansion
                    of our financial resources, has consumed time and energy. Yet such
                    changes are essential to combating hunger and poverty among rural
                    communities and achieving IFAD’s overarching goals. Thanks to the firm
                    foundations put in place during 2018, we are now much better positioned
                    to deliver on our mission and to support our Member States in achieving
                    the Sustainable Development Goals.

                    All these achievements were made possible only thanks to the continued
                    high-level commitment and dedication of staff at all levels.

    	IFAD loans and DSF grants for investment programmes and projects are denominated in special drawing rights. For the reader’s
      convenience, tables and charts use figures shown in US$ equivalents, as per the President’s report for each programme or project

An important task in 2018 involved a review of
the Grant Policy and Procedures. The review was
conducted to (i) improve grant utilization for the
benefit of IFAD’s target population, particularly
by using grants as a tool to promote innovation
and learning; and (ii) ensure that grant processes
are efficient and adapted to recent corporate
developments, such as the replenishment
commitments, decentralization, and changes in
organizational structure.
  Drawing on a deep and broad consultative
process, the review concluded that the Grant
Policy continued to be relevant and required no
revision. However, the procedures were revised,
reflecting senior management decisions and
recommendations from recent audits on grant
fiduciary management and the recipient selection
process. Some of the key changes introduced
relate to: sharpening the strategic orientation
of the grants; ensuring greater ownership and
accountability of senior management in grant
submission and management; further tightening
the eligibility and review criteria for grants;
ensuring more efficient and streamlined design,
review and approval processes; tightening the
requirements for competitive selection of grant
recipients; and further promoting the role of
grants in communication to raise awareness of
IFAD’s work and boost visibility.

In the case of misalignments that are considered
persistent and significant, IFAD undertakes a
realignment procedure by changing the currency ratios
in IFAD’s investment portfolio so as to realign the total
assets to the desired SDR weights.

(i) Liquidity risk
Prudent liquidity risk management includes maintaining
sufficient cash and cash equivalents to meet loan and
grant disbursements as well as other administrative
outflows as they arise.

IFAD’s liquidity risk is addressed through the MLR.
IFAD’s liquidity policy, together with the revised MLR for
the Tenth Replenishment of IFAD’s Resources (IFAD10)
period (2016-2018), states that highly liquid assets in
IFAD’s investment portfolio should remain above 60 per
cent of the projected annual gross disbursement level

    In addition to its pledge to the Eighth Replenishment of EUR 6 million, Ireland made a further contribution of EUR 891,000.
e
    Payments include cash and promissory notes. Amounts are expressed in thousands of United States dollars. Thus payments
    received for less than US$500 are not shown in appendix H. Consequently, the contribution from Zambia (US$148) does not appear
    above.
