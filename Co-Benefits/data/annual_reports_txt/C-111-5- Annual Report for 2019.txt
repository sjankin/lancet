FOREWORD

The activities encapsulated within the Annual Report for 2019 are reflective of the efforts made
throughout the year to strengthen IOM as a critical policy partner for States, while reinforcing our core
operations on the ground.

In 2019 IOM continued to grow. The Organization’s combined total revenue, comprising assessed
contributions, voluntary contributions and other income, increased by 17 per cent compared with
2018 and reached USD 2.13 billion. At the same time, the number of staff grew by 17 per cent to
14,811 by the end of the year.

A number of major institutional developments took place in 2019 stemming from the elaboration of
the IOM Strategic Vision, the strengthened Internal Governance Framework, and our growing role in
the United Nations system. The creation of the Policy Hub, the establishment of the United Nations
Network on Migration Secretariat and the Fund Management Unit of the Start-up Fund for Safe,
Orderly and Regular Migration, and work to develop a new strategic results framework, all reflect an
organization reaching a new maturity. Under the aegis of the Internal Governance Framework, we
have begun to deliver on critical areas of operational effectiveness, not least through strengthening
our internal justice system, but also by strengthening the capacities of our nine regional offices.

Following the adoption of the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration in late 2018,
IOM has committed itself to providing assistance to those States that request support to implement
the Global Compact. Since the adoption of the Global Compact, over 120 IOM offices reported that
they had provided assistance in this regard with nearly 50 country or regional migration coordination
mechanisms, including local extensions of the United Nations Network on Migration. Meanwhile, IOM
launched its Institutional Strategy on Migration and Sustainable Development, to support IOM offices
across the world in realizing the ambitions of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.

On the ground, our crisis-related programming reached over 28 million people in more than
75 countries in need of assistance, including Bangladesh, Nigeria, the Syrian Arab Republic and Yemen,
which all remained Level 3 emergencies. The Organization remained deeply involved in inter-agency
coordination of humanitarian assistance, leading on particular aspects of response in countries such
as Colombia, South Sudan and Turkey.

As we continue along the journey to realize our Strategic Vision, I hope that you can see ample
evidence in this Report of the commitment, purpose and innovation that each and every staff member
brings to IOM on a daily basis. I applaud their work and thank you for your support.

INTRODUCTION

1.        The Annual Report for 2019 presents the results achieved by the Organization during the
1 January to 31 December reporting period. The information provided is based on the reports given in
the institutional questionnaire, which was completed by IOM regional and country offices.

2.         The institutional questionnaire enjoyed a 100 per cent response rate for this reporting
period, with all nine regional offices participating in the data collection exercise. Regional and country
offices provided details of their major achievements, a summary of which is given in the present report
under the relevant MiGOF principle or objective. The second part of the report, on organizational
effectiveness, focuses on IOM’s achievements relating to internal performance, thus demonstrating a
clearer link between achievements and impact in the field, and efficiency and effectiveness within the
Organization itself.


2019 HIGHLIGHTS

3.       During the first full year under the leadership of Director General António Vitorino, the
Organization undertook a number of institutional processes designed to ensure that IOM is fit for
purpose for the coming decade.

4.        The IOM Strategic Vision, which spans the period 2019–2023, is the Director General’s
articulation of how IOM as an organization needs to develop in order to meet new and emerging
responsibilities. The Strategic Vision offers a common narrative about what is important about IOM’s
work, sets out issues in which the Organization expects to engage further and identifies areas requiring
institutional-strengthening. Following an internal consultation during the first part of 2019, the
Strategic Vision was circulated to Member States for their input and reflection. The final document
was presented at the IOM Council in November, along with a series of proposed next steps.

5.        In parallel, the Deputy Director General embarked on the development of the Internal
Governance Framework, designed to strengthen and modernize internal processes to meet the needs
of a rapidly growing organization. During the year, the Organization embarked on the first phase of
reform, including investments in ICT upgrades, a strategy for improved financial controls, and planning
for business transformation and the next generation enterprise resource planning system. In addition,
IOM further strengthened internal justice through the appointment of two new legal positions,
expansion of the investigations budget and a new case management system.

6.       A driver for this work was increased focus on migration within the United Nations system and
the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration, adopted in December 2018. IOM has
committed to supporting States in their implementation of the Global Compact, with over 120 offices
reporting that they had provided assistance in this regard in 2019.

7.        In January, the Secretariat of the United Nations Network on Migration was established at
IOM Headquarters. The Network was created by the United Nations Secretary-General to ensure
effective, timely and coordinated system-wide support to States in their implementation, follow-up
and review of the Global Compact and includes 38 United Nations system entities. IOM serves as the
Network Coordinator and Secretariat.

8.        Key activities of the Network included the inaugural Principals meeting in May, chaired by
the Director General, and the first annual meeting of the Network in December. 2019 also saw the
launch of the Start-up Fund for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration and the establishment of the Fund

Management Unit. The Fund had a target of USD 25 million for its first year of operations and is
governed by a Steering Committee comprising States, United Nations system entities and a broad
range of partners.

9.        During the year, the Network Secretariat developed a full workplan, established working
groups for priority areas, and began to establish the Network at regional and country level. IOM also
took the lead in delivering on several core priorities, including the establishment of a global knowledge
platform and connection hub and the development of guidance for UNCTs on helping States
implement the Global Compact.

10.        Another major institutional development was the creation of the Policy Hub. This unit was
established within the Office of the Director General in response to growing calls from Member States
for IOM to build its capacity for policy development and coordination across the Organization. In
essence, this involves two distinct yet interrelated pillars of work: knowledge management and
facilitating collaborative cross-organizational work.

11.      At the request of the Director General, the Policy Hub also embarked on the development of
a comprehensive IOM migration data strategy in line with the IOM Strategic Vision. This involved the
establishment of several data task forces to enhance quality and consistency throughout the IOM
migration data life cycle and whose work will feed into the migration data strategy.

12.       With respect to knowledge management, the Policy Hub made considerable progress in
developing the IOM Migration Policy Repository, a sharing and learning resource for IOM staff. The
Repository was rolled out to all regions and at Headquarters during the second half of 2019. By the
end of the year, more than 150 policies and policy support works had been registered from 55 offices,
regional offices and Headquarters divisions. The Policy Hub also created a staff exchange programme
for specialist field staff come to the unit to share their knowledge and further develop IOM’s policy
approaches on substantive migration issues. The first such exchange focused on IOM engagement with
the private sector on labour supply chain integrity and migrant worker protection.

13.       Institutional development does not come at the expense of IOM’s operational effectiveness,
but is intended to further support it. In 2019, crisis-related programming reached over 28 million
people in more than 75 countries in need of assistance, including Bangladesh, Nigeria, the Syrian Arab
Republic and Yemen, which all remained Level 3 emergencies. The Organization remained deeply
involved in inter-agency coordination of humanitarian assistance, leading on particular aspects of
response in countries such as Colombia, South Sudan and Turkey. In addition, IOM supported the
resettlement, humanitarian admission and relocation of over 100,000 refugees and other vulnerable
populations, assisted over 400,000 beneficiaries with temporary and long-term visa applications, and
assisted over 100,000 with family reunification processes. IOM provided or assisted in the provision of
over 400,000 migration health assessments for refugees and migrants across almost 100 countries,
and also gave health assistance to returnees and beneficiaries of counter-trafficking programming.


PRINCIPLE 1: ADHERENCE TO INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS AND FULFILMENT OF
MIGRANTS’ RIGHTS

Supporting States’ adherence to international standards

14.       Good migration governance requires compliance with international law, including human
rights, which is reflected in MiGOF Principle 1: Adherence to international standards and fulfilment of
migrants’ rights. With the adoption of the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration in
-----------------------Page 10 End-----------------------

                                                                                                   C/111/5
                                                                                                    Page 3


December 2018 by the United Nations General Assembly, States reiterated their commitment to
protecting the human rights of migrants. With the inception of the Global Compact implementation
phase in 2019, IOM continued to support those States that accepted the Global Compact to ensure
that its implementation outputs were aligned with international standards.

15.      During the reporting period, assistance to Member States to ensure adherence to migration-
related international standards was provided by IOM offices in all regions. One hundred and
twenty-two offices reported having supported Member States in meeting their commitments towards
adherence to international standards and good governance, with national governments explicitly
requesting 101 of these offices for support.

16.       In promoting adherence to international standards and fulfilment of migrants’ rights, IOM
engaged with government officials, CSOs and the private sector through workshops and training, which
focused on topics such as human rights at international borders, international standards relating to
trafficking and smuggling, rights of migrant workers, protection of migrant children and their families,
access to justice for migrants and alternatives to detention.

17.      Furthermore, 61 offices submitted information to the international or regional human rights
monitoring bodies or supported a national human rights commission to advance the protection of
migrants’ rights.

18.       IOM also provided assistance and technical advice to governments to develop and review
laws and policies to strengthen adherence to international law. The wide range of support offered
included compliance assessments, technical cooperation, secondment of IOM staff to government
institutions to support alignment with and effective implementation of international law, and
consultations with relevant stakeholders on the implementation of international standards.

19.        In Armenia, for instance, IOM support led to an improvement in market regulations through
the implementation of work permit issuance systems for foreign workers in the country. The
government decree regulating the issuance of work permits was amended and business procedures
were drafted in line with international standards. In Mauritania, IOM’s support to the Ministry of
Justice in revising legal frameworks on smuggling and trafficking resulted in a draft bill containing rights
for victims of trafficking and reinforced protections for smuggled migrants. In the Niger, IOM provided
legal advice to the Government on the national disarmament, demobilization and reintegration
framework, which led to the adoption of an amended Criminal Code and supported the development
and adoption of a national programme addressing former Boko Haram combatants.

20.        In a joint initiative, IOM and the European Union organized technical and high-level
intergovernmental consultations with the Governments of Ethiopia, Kenya and the United Republic of
Tanzania and training on international migration law for government officials. The outcome of these
initiatives was the adoption of a set of agreed recommendations, developed to lay the groundwork for
future policy work in alignment with international standards. In Costa Rica, IOM collaborated on the
development of the Regional Framework Law on Migration, with an emphasis on human rights,
approved by the Forum of Presidents of Legislative Branches in Central America and the Caribbean
(FOPREL) in August.

A principled approach in the Organization

21.       Throughout the reporting period, IOM worked to improve the recognition and protection of
the rights of migrants, irrespective of their nationality or migration status, as migrants are often
vulnerable to rights violations if living in precarious situations in receiving States.

Principled humanitarian action

22.      IOM is committed to principled humanitarian action. The Organization’s humanitarian policy
(C/106/CRP/20) and the accompanying operational guidance frame its emergency response, which is
guided by humanitarian principles, norms and professional standards. Adherence to the four core
humanitarian principles of humanity, impartiality, neutrality and independence make it easier to
access those in need of humanitarian assistance, to manage uncertainty and risk in volatile
environments, to navigate humanitarian challenges and to enhance protective programming.
Humanitarian principles continued to inform IOM’s operational and strategic decision-making, for
example, in Afghanistan, Iraq, Nigeria and South Sudan.

23.        The Organization continued to invest in meeting its humanitarian commitments and
delivering safe, accountable and effective responses. Within the multi-annual capacity-strengthening
initiative in collaboration with the International Association of Professionals in Humanitarian
Assistance and Protection, 126 IOM staff achieved one or more professional humanitarian
certifications with sector-wide recognition through the Association’s practice-based Credentialing
Program, which promotes the highest of professional standards. Humanitarian principles were
mainstreamed in the Organization’s institutional training programmes, for instance the Chiefs of
Mission Training, the Senior Emergency Leadership and Coordination Training, the Emergency
Response Induction Training and the Counter-Trafficking in Crisis Training. At least 1,100 staff were
trained on mainstreaming protection across all IOM programming, ensuring that IOM leads by example
in its principled humanitarian action.

24.        Demonstrating its commitment to strengthening institutional learning in humanitarian
action, in 2019, IOM became a member of ALNAP, a global network of NGOs, United Nations agencies,
members of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, donors, academics, networks
and consultants dedicated to learning how to improve response to humanitarian crises. Additionally,
the 2019 Regional IOM–NGO Humanitarian Consultation, co-organized with the International Council
of Voluntary Agencies, was held in October in Istanbul and focused on humanitarian access in
emergencies and protracted crises in the Middle East and North Africa. These consultations are held
annually to promote dialogue with current and prospective NGO partners in crisis response, with the
aim of strengthening cooperation and ultimately better serving crisis-affected populations.

Gender equality and gender mainstreaming

25.      The Organization stepped up its efforts to promote gender equality and gender
mainstreaming at the global level and continued to provide technical support in this area to its regional
and country offices.

26.       In the field, 140 IOM offices reported that gender equality considerations had been
mainstreamed in their projects during 2019. Focusing on the long term, the main gender-related
engagement for most offices was to mainstream gender in migration or other policies, as reported by
102 offices, followed by economic and skills empowerment of a disadvantaged or under-represented
gender, as reported by 84 offices. Seventy-nine offices also reported working to address violence,
exploitation or abuse relating to migrants of a specific gender.

27.      With regard to programming outcomes, 55 offices reported that IOM efforts had increased
employment or income among disadvantaged gender groups; 38 offices reported that their activities
had improved health outcomes for a disadvantaged gender; and 56 reported that IOM initiatives had
either increased access to justice for survivors of gender-based violence and/or contributed to
decreased prevalence of gender-based violence.

28.      In terms of combating gender-based violence, the IOM Offices in Belgium, Malta and the
Netherlands reported on the European Union-funded PROTECT project, implemented by IOM in
12 European Union countries, which has raised awareness about gender-based violence among
migrant communities and built the capacities of first-line workers and other professionals working with
migrant survivors of gender-based violence. In Bosnia and Herzegovina, IOM efforts contributed to
increased access to justice for survivors of conflict-related sexual violence, of all genders, through the
outreach and awareness-raising efforts of the recently adopted Government of Republika Srpska Law
on the Protection of Victims of Torture. In Croatia and France, gender equality and gender-based
violence were included in orientation programmes for resettled migrants.

29.       In South Sudan, IOM worked with a local NGO to pilot behaviour change approaches to
transform harmful gender norms, through engaging men in accountable practices to end gender-based
violence, with evidence of positive changes in behaviour. In Turkey, IOM continued to work on a joint
United Nations project to prevent child, early and forced marriage, providing training for governmental
and non-governmental actors as well as outreach activities with mobile teams.

30.        In terms of health promotion activities, IOM made efforts to improve menstrual health for
women and girls by conducting research on the topic in the Marshall Islands, including during natural
disasters.

31.      Achievements were also made in the area of empowering women and girls. In Myanmar, for
example, as part of a community stabilization project, grants were provided to women’s committees
– enabling them to make decisions and influence implementation of initiatives. In South Sudan, IOM
promoted women’s participation in camp governance structures, increasing women’s empowerment
as measured by the Women’s Empowerment Index.

Protection from sexual exploitation and abuse

32.       The Organization continued to lead global efforts to advance inter-agency PSEA initiatives
and to help institutionalize and strengthen inter-agency PSEA leadership and coordination. It remained
an active member of the IASC Results Group on Accountability and Inclusion and continued to be the
IASC official liaison with the United Nations Working Group on Sexual Exploitation and Abuse,
advocating for the harmonization of United Nations and IASC protocols and guidance on PSEA
responsibilities.

33.       At Headquarters, IOM continued to exercise its unique mandate in providing technical
assistance on request to in-country PSEA networks and humanitarian country teams/UNCTs on
collective PSEA activities. The Organization provided such tailored technical assistance to 26 in-country
and regional teams aiming at establishing and implementing collective PSEA structures, such as inter-
agency referral mechanisms.

34.       From Headquarters, IOM developed and carried out global training for full-time in-country
PSEA Coordinators, engaging them under contract with various agencies and reporting to
Resident/Humanitarian Coordinators in 10 responses.1 Forty IOM country offices reported that a PSEA
Coordinator was supporting inter-agency PSEA work in country, with 14 being full-time posts. IOM
holds the full-time PSEA Coordinator contract in three responses: Bangladesh, Somalia and the Turkey–
north-west Syrian Arab Republic hub.

35.       Sixty IOM offices were part of an in-country PSEA network or task force, compared with
forty-eight in 2018. Of these, IOM co-chairs the network in two countries (Greece and Somalia). IOM
country offices also continued to participate actively in inter-agency networks on PSEA. UNCTs and
humanitarian country teams make up the highest proportion of senior-level bodies dedicated to
overseeing the implementation of the in-country PSEA network’s action plan.

36.      Thirty-seven IOM offices (25%) reported having an inter-agency referral mechanism for
handling complaints, and 19 offices (13%) reported that such a mechanism was under development.
Of the offices that reported having an inter-agency referral mechanism, 29 (78%) reported that this
system includes referral pathways to provide sexual exploitation and abuse survivors with appropriate
assistance services.

37.       IOM Chiefs of Mission have the responsibility to ensure that training sessions on PSEA are
regularly organized in their offices. In 2019, 6,409 IOM personnel worldwide (56% male and
44% female) received face-to-face training on PSEA, compared with 4,827 in 2018.

                      Number of staff who received face-to-face PSEA training




Accountability to affected populations

38.       To further its commitment to implementing the standards for an inclusive people-centred
approach, and for establishing appropriate processes and procedures for handling complaints, 39 IOM
offices integrated AAP into their country strategies and in humanitarian programming, including five
out of the six crisis responses with Level 3 designation, namely Bangladesh, Mozambique, Nigeria, the
Syrian Arab Republic and Yemen.

39.      The Organization widely shares information about its work using multiple communication
channels. For example, in Kenya, refugees in camps in Kakuma were able to contact IOM’s resettlement
and movement operations personnel via email to enquire about the status of their cases. In Malta,
IOM had a dedicated phone line for enquiries regarding assisted voluntary return and reintegration. In
the Syrian Arab Republic, information regarding the AAP hotline was widely circulated among
beneficiaries by printing them on NFI kits and e-vouchers that were distributed.

                                                                                                 C/111/5
                                                                                                  Page 7


40.       The Organization maintained a high level of engagement with beneficiaries throughout the
project cycle and particularly during project implementation. It widely used community feedback to
monitor and evaluate projects. Communities were also consulted during the design and planning
phases of projects. Feedback was also considered in making adjustments to programmatic activities,
and to project targets and timelines. As an example, during the response to Typhoon Mangkhut in the
Philippines, affected populations guided the selection process for transitional shelter sites and
alternative modalities for shelter solutions when safe sites were no longer available for shelter
construction. The demographic characteristics of communities, such as gender, age, language, literacy
rate, disabilities and other diversities, are taken into consideration by IOM when engaging with the
people it seeks to assist. This is consistent with the Organization’s commitment to an inclusive people-
centred approach in its operations.

41.       This engagement substantially influenced IOM programmes, such as in Bosnia and
Herzegovina, where direct feedback and suggestions from beneficiaries resulted in IOM seeking
funding for and then providing services and implementing activities in migrant centres. A women’s
corner organizing social activities was set up in two centres supported first by the United Kingdom and
later by the United States Agency for International Development. In Cameroon, the involvement of
beneficiaries in the implementation of reintegration projects enabled a more objective and realistic
identification of needs and helped to design more effective and suitable reintegration plans.

42.       In order to improve safe spaces for reporting complaints regarding IOM assistance and
services and staff conduct, 59 offices had written standard operating procedures for handling feedback
and complaints from stakeholders, while 61 offices had established mechanisms to monitor and
analyse feedback and complaint trends systematically, via online feedback tools, face-to-face
consultations, telephone hotlines, suggestion boxes, complaint desks and software apps.

43.       IOM also remained committed to establishing collective accountability wherever possible, to
improve the quality of service for its beneficiaries and to adapt more quickly to the needs of affected
populations. To this end, 23 offices had an AAP focal point to participate in inter-agency AAP activities.
The focal points participated in a range of forums, including community engagement working groups
and inter-cluster coordination groups on reporting trends in community feedback and complaints.
They also contributed to the collective efforts of the humanitarian country teams in ensuring
community views are taken into account in humanitarian response plans.


PRINCIPLE 2: EVIDENCE AND WHOLE-OF-GOVERNMENT APPROACH

Strengthening production and analysis of migration data and evidence

44.       One of IOM’s commitments is to serve Member States and the international community as
the lead reference for data and evidence on migration. To this effect, IOM endeavours to strengthen
the production and analysis of national, regional and global migration data, for both external and
internal use, while respecting the IOM Data Protection Principles for protection of personal data.
Several initiatives were launched within the IOM Data Steering Group in this regard, including the
development of an IOM migration data strategy and efforts to further enhance quality and consistency
throughout the IOM migration data life cycle. In addition, IOM is committed to conducting and
supporting research that informs migration policy and practice, while contributing to the broader
understanding of migration patterns and processes.

45.     To this end, IOM produced 194 publications in 2019, bringing the total of those uploaded on
the IOM Online Bookstore to 295. During the year, the number of downloads of publications on the
bookstore totalled just under 2.7 million. These high download rates were in part linked to the
-----------------------Page 15 End-----------------------

C/111/5
Page 8


World Migration Report 2018, which became the most downloaded IOM publication ever with over
500,000 downloads by the end of 2019. The latest edition, World Migration Report 2020, was launched
by the Director General at the IOM Council on 27 November 2019.

46.       One hundred and fifteen IOM offices published or completed studies covering a wide range
of subject areas, including displacement tracking, labour mobility and migration, trafficking in persons,
forced labour, child labour, and migrants’ vulnerability to violence, exploitation and abuse.

47.       In 2019, IOM released a number of global-level tools and materials designed to improve the
migration data capacities of Member States, in collaboration with other United Nations agencies and
partners. Examples of such tools included a report outlining good practices in migration data capacity
development and IOM’s work to support data capacity-building initiatives in Africa and beyond, and a
regional guide for migration data harmonization in ECOWAS countries.

48.       To further strengthen the availability of high-quality data, research and analysis on migration,
90 offices built the capacities of external partners, including government counterparts, NGOs, CSOs,
other United Nations agencies and academia in areas such as migration data reporting, analysis,
sharing and collection and understanding and monitoring the SDGs.

49.       IOM also continued its coordinated work in West and North Africa to map and improve
countries’ capacity to collect, analyse and use migration data for policy development. In close
collaboration with regional and country offices, the Global Migration Data Analysis Centre prepared
national data assessment reports for four countries in West Africa, namely Burkina Faso, Côte d’Ivoire,
Guinea and the Niger. It also facilitated national consultations among representatives from various
government entities and partners in these countries intending to design an action plan for improving
coordination on migration statistics.

50.       The Organization supported the Government of Myanmar in establishing a database system
for data on return, reintegration and rehabilitation of victims of trafficking. It conducted a study with
the Department of Rehabilitation on the effectiveness of reintegration services and trained 15 of the
Department’s staff members on interviewing skills for data collection. In the Central African Republic,
IOM’s local partners were trained on data collection, analysis and reporting methodologies.

51.      IOM also partnered closely with research institutions through consultations, training,
seminars, courses and curricula design, as well as conducting joint research. For example, it partnered
with the African Union’s African Institute of Remittances to strengthen research on remittances.

52.        The Organization conducted a comprehensive assessment of its central case management
system (MiMOSA), with a view to delivering a technologically advanced version that incorporates a
scalable design aligned with current and evolving business requirements. It continued to collect high-
quality policy- and programme-relevant data on the beneficiaries of IOM protection and assistance,
using MiMOSA. In 2019, the database increased its scope to include information on over 50,000 victims
of trafficking, over 20,000 vulnerable migrants, over 500,000 assisted voluntary return cases (with over
100,000 reintegration activities) and over 21,000 surveys of longitudinal data on reintegration
outcomes. IOM is engaging in a range of initiatives for these data to be used in the global evidence
base to support stakeholders in ensuring that human rights are upheld in the context of well-managed
migration. This includes understanding key factors contributing to return and reintegration
experiences, outcomes, opportunities and challenges and using the IOM determinants of migrant
vulnerability model to understand the risk and protective factors that make migrants vulnerable to
trafficking, exploitation and abuse at different stages of their journey.

                                                                                               C/111/5
                                                                                                Page 9


53.        The Organization also continued to work with its partners to develop the evidence base on
human trafficking through the Counter-Trafficking Data Collaborative, which, by the end of the year,
had nearly 6,000 unique users per month. Fifteen per cent of visitors were returning users. The data
were used in a number of reports in 2019, including a joint report with the ILO, OECD and UNICEF,
Ending Child Labour, Forced Labour and Human Trafficking in Global Supply Chains, which provides the
first-ever estimates of child labour and human trafficking in global supply chains. The report was
produced in response to a call by the Group of Twenty for an assessment of violations of core labour
rights in global supply chains.

54.      The Missing Migrants Project continued to collect data on migrant deaths and
disappearances. Project outputs, including a fourth volume in the Fatal Journeys series, were cited in
more than 2,000 online media articles, 117 academic reports and reports by several European Union
and United Nations bodies, and several workshops were held to improve data collection in various
regions of the world.

55.       The Migration Data Portal had more than 1.2 million views in 2019 and reached an average
of 68,000 monthly active users by November. The Portal is the source for much of the information on
the United Nations migration web page and is also sourced as a reference in international media. Key
sections of the Portal were launched in German and Spanish. Additionally, two regional migration data
overview pages were created, on Europe and Eastern Africa, with the former being produced in
collaboration with the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission. During the year, IOM also
developed future migration scenarios through several projects related to the European Union.

56.        Under the umbrella of the Big Data for Migration Alliance, IOM worked towards the
development of a data innovation directory – a repository of data innovation projects and applications
in the field of migration and human mobility – to be featured on the Migration Data Portal.

57.      IOM has a wealth of migrant-related data to inform decision-making at all levels of the
Organization. In 2019, it laid the groundwork for several data initiatives for the progressive
implementation of robust data tools and analytics to facilitate the expansion of cloud-based
technologies (e.g. business intelligence, artificial intelligence and machine learning). This will drive
business transformation and equip the Organization with secure data and information platforms.

Displacement Tracking Matrix

58.       Between January and December, the DTM collected, analysed and disseminated data on
population mobility in 78 countries, tracking the movements of over 24.9 million IDPs, 16.5 million
IDP returnees and 4.6 million returnees from abroad. The Organization also played an integral part in
the development of the International Recommendations on IDP Statistics, produced by the Expert
Group on Refugee and Internally Displaced Persons Statistics, and is fully committed to supporting
their implementation going forward.

59.      During the year, the DTM continued to improve analysis of displacement and flow data within
and across regions, resulting in the publication of 1,620 reports and mapping products, which received
over 620,000 downloads.

60.      DTM staff also continued to support IOM commitments to the Grand Bargain principles and
to contribute to workstream 5 on improving needs assessments. They reviewed, enhanced and
disseminated the workstream’s outputs, which included the Grand Bargain Principles for Coordinated
Needs Assessment Ethos and related tools, and launched the DTM and Partners Toolkit. The Toolkit is
incorporated in the DTM global training module and influences IOM operations in the field.
-----------------------Page 17 End-----------------------

61.       The Organization continued its collaboration with the Humanitarian Data Exchange,
managed by OCHA, to increase interoperability and availability of DTM data. DTM mobility tracking
data from 21 out of 25 countries are available on the Humanitarian Data Exchange portal to inform
cluster/sector partners. By the end of the year, IOM was among the top three data providers among
the United Nations organizations on the Humanitarian Data Exchange.

62.       DTM operations worldwide continued to expand, ensuring provision of data and analysis to
support humanitarian, development and migration programming. In Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Iraq and
Pakistan, as part of a regional programme, DTM staff worked closely with government and
humanitarian and development partners to improve understanding of displacement and migration
dynamics, drivers, modalities and vulnerabilities to strengthen the formulation and implementation of
humanitarian and development policy and programming. In the Pacific, IOM, in partnership with the
Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre and the Platform on Disaster Displacement, initiated a
subregional initiative to strengthen policies, programming and capacity to manage and respond to
disaster displacement risks. As part of Ebola preparedness activities, the DTM team in South Sudan
operated flow monitoring points at borders with the Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic
of the Congo and Uganda.

63.        IOM responded in a number of ways to the challenge of collecting and analysing data on
disability inclusion in humanitarian settings. For example, the DTM collected data and provided
analysis on disability inclusion in humanitarian operations in Nigeria and South Sudan.

Whole-of-government approach to migration

64.       The role played by IOM in the international architecture has increased in recent years as a
result of increased migration volumes and greater international attention to migration. With IOM’s
new role as Coordinator of the United Nations Network on Migration and in supporting the
implementation of the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration, demands for IOM
policy advice on migration issues, including through coordinated efforts within the United Nations
system, continued to grow. The Organization’s capacity to provide such support to governments at
local and national level is, therefore, of increasing importance, and its ability to translate its vast field
experience into tangible policy recommendations is an essential part of its mission.

2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development

65.       The IOM whole-of-government approach to migration includes efforts by governments to
achieve the migration-related aspects of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, by integrating
migration into development planning. During the reporting period, 126 offices supported governments
with the implementation of the 2030 Agenda and the SDGs. IOM made progress in three main
directions, in line with the IOM Strategic Vision: formulation of an internal road map to foster internal
cohesiveness; acceleration of partnerships with sister United Nations agencies; and enhancing field
capacity to engage UNCTs for mainstreaming migration in development planning, while supporting
achievement of the objectives of the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration.

66.       In 2019, IOM launched the Institutional Strategy on Migration and Sustainable Development,
which defines IOM’s vision and priority areas for intervention to leverage migration for sustainable
development outcomes. Based on extensive internal and external consultations, the Strategy
operationalizes some of the institutional shifts outlined in the IOM Strategic Vision – including more
effective cross-departmental collaboration, greater coherence and development impact of IOM
operations and stronger focus on partnerships within the United Nations development system. This
will enable IOM to operate successfully within the enhanced coordination and pooled funding
mechanisms that have been put in place through the Secretary-General’s reform of the United Nations
-----------------------Page 18 End-----------------------

                                                                                                 C/111/5
                                                                                                 Page 11


development system. Furthermore, the IOM publication Migration and the 2030 Agenda: A Guide for
Practitioners was disseminated worldwide, enabling the Organization to align its work with the SDGs
and to support governments to integrate migration into their SDG implementation efforts.

67.      To bolster IOM engagement in the United Nations system and support for the 2030 Agenda,
Headquarters and regional offices developed guidance and held workshops, webinars and regular
coordination meetings to strengthen the application of financial, administrative and policy-related
measures, enhanced the clarity and impact of messaging on IOM engagement in United Nations
reforms, and trained IOM staff across the world on how to represent the Organization and its
programmes in UNCTs and other forums based on MiGOF, the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and
Regular Migration or other policy frameworks.

68.         Institutional capacities to support Member States to implement and report on the
2030 Agenda were also strengthened through the development of an internal training package,
training workshops held for IOM staff and direct assistance provided to offices working with
governments to support SDG implementation. To support this, two groups were established to guide
and promote SDG-related processes and activities: the SDG Working Group and a network of IOM SDG
Champions. Utilizing a virtual platform and building on the work overseen by the SDG Working Group,
the SDG Champions network strengthens organizational understanding and reach on SDG-related
activities.

69.       The Organization also provides ad hoc support to countries that are embarking on Global
Compact planning and implementation. For instance, in Chad, IOM supported the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs in conducting a national consultation on the Global Compact which resulted in a
2019–2021 workplan of key priorities and strategies for its implementation. Similarly, in Ghana, IOM
built the capacity of 30 CSOs on SDG implementation.

Integrating migration into development and other sectoral policies

70.       Ninety offices supported Member States to mainstream migration into development or
sectoral policy revision, planning and implementation. Collaboration took place with key ministries and
sectors, such as development, employment, health and social protection. Other sectors included
diaspora engagement in Albania and Austria and rural development in Belgium and Madagascar.
Through engagement with both national and local levels of governance, IOM support ranged from
capacity-building and supporting inter-agency cooperation to secondment of experts to government
institutions.

71.        In Brazil, IOM assisted the Office of the Attorney General to launch a network for building
migration-related capacities at local level, for both government and non-government organizations. In
Eswatini,  IOM support led to the finalization of a new labour migration policy. In West Africa, with the
help of technical assistance provided by IOM in 2019, ECOWAS developed a new regional migration
policy fully aligned with the SDGs.

Enhancing governments’ capacity to formulate sound migration policies

72.       During the reporting period, 11 new countries participated in the Migration Governance
Indicators process to assess the comprehensiveness of their migration governance frameworks and
engage in a conversation on what well-managed migration policies mean in practice. In Albania, for
instance, the assessment served as a baseline for the National Strategy on Migration 2019–2022 and
its Action Plan. Additionally, the pilot phase of the Local MGI continued to take stock of local migration
strategies and initiatives; identify good practices and areas that could be further developed; and foster
the dialogue on migration between national governments and local authorities.
-----------------------Page 19 End-----------------------

C/111/5
Page 12


73.      IOM also worked with its fellow co-custodian for SDG indicator 10.7.2, the United Nations
Department for Economic and Social Affairs, and OECD to help ensure a high response rate to the
United Nations Twelfth Inquiry among Governments on Population and Development, which is the
source of data for this indicator. The data for indicator 10.7.2, which seeks to measure migration
governance, collected from 111 countries were analysed for a number of joint IOM–United Nations–
OECD publications in 2019.


PRINCIPLE 3: PARTNERSHIPS

Global partnerships

74.       Eighty-one offices reported that they were actively engaged in global partnerships in 2019.
Most engagements related to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, followed by initiatives
to assist migrants in crisis contexts and Alliance 8.7, and mostly involved participation in meetings,
capacity-building, facilitation of meetings and provision of technical advice.

International Dialogue on Migration

75.       The IDM, IOM’s principal multi-stakeholder forum for migration policy dialogue and analysis
of migration governance, dedicated its two regular sessions to engaging and empowering young
people as key partners in migration governance. This theme was chosen for IDM 2019 following calls
made by participants at previous IDM sessions for greater engagement with youth in migration
governance efforts. It also aligned with the United Nations Youth Strategy, especially priority 1:
engagement, participation and advocacy. IDM 2019 contributed to collective efforts to enhance
migration governance and policy frameworks and foster greater cooperation and partnerships for
future action.

76.      The first IDM session was held in February at the United Nations Headquarters in New York
under the title Youth and migration: engaging youth as key partners in migration governance. The
event brought together over 300 participants and was part of “migration week”, which included events
organized by the President of the United Nations General Assembly and the United Nations
Department of Economic and Social Affairs.

77.      The second IDM session, entitled Unlocking the potential of youth to respond to the new
challenges and opportunities of migration, was held in Geneva in October. Some 400 participants
representing youth, governments, NGOs, academia, the private sector and international and regional
organizations, such as the United Nations, the European Union and the African Union, joined the
discussions and provided a wide range of perspectives.

78.       IDM 2019 contributed to ongoing global processes relevant to youth and migration and
supported the United Nations overall efforts to amplify youth voices and promote their involvement
in global migration debates. As such, it was also part of the IOM action plan in response to the
United Nations Youth Strategy. An analysis of the multi-stakeholder discussions and best practices and
recommendations gathered during IDM 2019 were published in IDM No. 29: Youth and Migration.

Global Forum on Migration and Development

79.       IOM supported the Government of Ecuador, the 2019 Chair of the GFMD, by providing
technical, financial and logistical support for preparations for the Twelfth GFMD Summit, held in
-----------------------Page 20 End-----------------------

                                                                                                            C/111/5
                                                                                                            Page 13


Quito.2 As co-steerer of the Mayors Mechanism, IOM co-organized the Sixth Mayoral Forum on Human
Mobility, Migration and Development, which brought together over 80 mayors and officials from
56 cities and regions to participate for the first time as formal stakeholders in the GFMD. The
Organization also provided technical support for the second edition of the Youth Forum in Quito, an
official event preceding the GFMD Summit.

80.      During the reporting period, 27 offices engaged in the GFMD, through attending meetings
and events, contributions to documents, presentations at events, capacity-building and technical
advice. Offices reported that engagement with the GFMD resulted in enhanced partnerships with key
stakeholders, such as host governments, cities and local governments, intergovernmental
organizations, civil society and the private sector, improved the profile of IOM and led to better
programming opportunities. For instance, involvement in the GFMD enabled IOM to strengthen its
partnership with the National Bureau of Statistics in South Sudan.

Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration

81.      The Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration was the first United Nations
global cooperation framework covering all dimensions of international migration in a comprehensive
manner. The entire Organization was involved in supporting the Global Compact process.

82.      In addition, the United Nations Secretary-General created the United Nations Network on
Migration to ensure effective, timely and coordinated system-wide support to States in their
implementation, follow-up and review of the Global Compact. The Network includes 38 United Nations
system entities. Its Executive Committee, comprising eight entities (including IOM), provides overall
guidance on the work of the Network. IOM serves as the Network Coordinator and Secretariat.

83.       During the reporting period, IOM provided technical and policy support to 91 national
governments and 16 local governments for the operationalization of the Global Compact. This support
mostly related to capacity-building for Global Compact implementation, assistance for Global
Compact-related events and studies on preparations for Global Compact implementation. For
instance, in Ecuador, IOM participated in the monthly national round table on human mobility,
presenting information on the Global Compact and its relevance to the country. Forty-four offices
engaged with non-State actors in the Global Compact context, including CSOs, academia and think
tanks. The type of engagement varied, from conducting briefings to organizing joint events.
Eighty-two offices also engaged in similar activities with the United Nations and other
intergovernmental bodies in the context of Global Compact implementation. These engagements were
primarily with UNCTs (in 67 countries), as well as bilaterally with other United Nations agencies,
regional consultative processes on migration or interregional forums on migration.

84.      Since the adoption of the Global Compact and the establishment of the United Nations
Network on Migration, nearly 50 country or regional networks or similar migration coordination
mechanisms have been created to provide support for Global Compact implementation. For example,
in the Republic of Moldova, IOM established a national-level task force to support Global Compact
implementation. In Jordan, IOM co-chairs with the ILO the migration working group to facilitate
implementation and reporting on the Global Compact.

85.      At regional level, the Regional United Nations Migration Network for West and Central Africa
was established in Dakar, and the Regional Network on Migration for Asia and the Pacific in Bangkok.

86.      At country level, the United Nations Network on Migration was established in 14 countries
(Bangladesh, Chad, Ethiopia, Gambia, Georgia, Ghana, Guinea-Bissau, Haiti, Kenya, Mauritania,
Republic of Moldova, Nigeria, Senegal, Thailand).

87.       The Network established working groups for some of the core and thematic workstreams it
had identified. IOM leads Core Working Group 1.2 on establishing a global knowledge platform and
connection hub, and also co-leads Core Working Group 2.1 on bolstering the capacity of the Network
at global, regional and country levels to support Member States to implement the Global Compact,
and Core Working Group 2.2 on empowering Member States to develop and implement Global
Compact national implementation plans.

Regional and interregional partnerships

88.        Regional and interregional bodies and forums are important entities for pursuing
international migration governance. The regional and interregional consultative processes and forums
on migration are State-led mechanisms. They have been instrumental in providing a platform for
governments and other relevant stakeholders, including intergovernmental organizations, NGOs and
civil society, to come together to discuss policy matters and areas for collaboration to address
migration issues.

Regional consultative processes on migration

89.        Seventy-two IOM offices reported having worked with a number of regional consultative
processes on migration. Twelve country offices engaged with the Migration Dialogue for Southern
Africa, eight were involved in the Almaty Process on refugee protection and international migration,
and five participated in the Migration Dialogue for West Africa. Several offices in South America also
engaged in the Quito Process to facilitate regional intergovernmental coordination of the response for
refugees and migrants from the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela.

90.       In May, IOM facilitated a consultation held in Bangkok among Colombo Process Member
States to discuss engagement in the implementation, progress review and follow-up of global
frameworks on migration. The consultation, attended by Member State representatives, civil society,
the private sector and development partners, provided a platform for participants to share experiences
and perspectives at national level on implementation and key achievements of the Colombo Process
thematic area working groups. Participants discussed how the Colombo Process could contribute to
the implementation of global frameworks at national level.

Interregional forums on migration

91.      Twenty-nine country offices reported engaging with interregional forums on migration;
among these, eight offices worked on the Bali Process on People Smuggling, Trafficking in Persons and
Related Transnational Crime, and five supported ministerial consultations of the Abu Dhabi Dialogue.

Cooperation with the United Nations and other intergovernmental organizations

92.       The Organization continued to forge strong bilateral partnerships with various international
actors. During the reporting period, 68 offices engaged with intergovernmental organizations; this had
a considerable impact on programming and IOM’s profile at regional level and enhanced cooperation
on project implementation, access to funding, cooperation among working groups on policy, legislation
and strategy development, and access to different areas and communities.

                                                                                               Page 15


93.      IOM continued to report on United Nations commitments, including the funding compact
and the quadrennial comprehensive policy review. It also contributed to Secretary-General reports on
a wide range of topics, for example on sustainable development of small island developing States, and
women, peace and security.

94.       In total, 18 country offices reported that they had signed a new United Nations cooperation
framework. For 13 of these, migration, mobility or displacement was included in both the narrative
and the results matrix of the cooperation framework. Sixty-one offices also reported being actively
involved in the drafting of the common country analysis in their countries.

95.       IOM continued to maintain a prominent presence in United Nations coordination structures.
In 2019, 129 IOM offices were part of UNCTs, while 91 were part of the operations management team,
and 66 were part of the humanitarian country team. Eighty offices participated in UNCT and Resident
Coordinator performance reviews.

96.       Since its entry into the United Nations system, IOM has been proactively involved in a
number of inter-agency networks, including the inter-agency working groups on migration.
Fifty-three offices reported having an inter-agency working group on migration. In 57 countries, IOM
chaired or co-chaired an outcome group or another inter-agency coordination mechanism.

97.       Other examples of cooperation with United Nations organizations included the development,
in coordination with UNHCR, of the 2020 Refugee and Migrant Response Plan for refugees and
migrants from the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, which was launched in November 2019. In April,
the United Nations Emergency Relief Coordinator, the IOM Director General and the United Nations
High Commissioner for Refugees undertook a joint visit to Bangladesh. Together, they launched a joint
appeal for funding to meet the needs of Rohingya refugees and reiterated their commitment to find
safe and sustainable solutions for Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh, and to create conducive conditions
for safe and dignified return to Myanmar.

98.       Furthermore, 40 offices signed the business operations strategy of the United Nations
Sustainable Development Group to accelerate harmonization efforts of business operations, in
particular for reducing the duplication of functions and administrative and transaction costs within the
United Nations system. Additionally, 71 offices were using United Nations common services, such as
office supplies and furniture, telecommunication services and mail or courier services.

National and local governments

99.      Migration presents opportunities and challenges that are addressed by a wide range of
government ministries and other public entities. IOM partners with national and local authorities to
build their capacities and improve overall migration governance, using a whole-of-government
approach as described in the above “Principle 2” section. At national level, IOM worked with a large
number of institutions and authorities on areas such as immigration/migration, foreign, international
and consular affairs, interior and home affairs, border management, labour and livelihoods.

100.      In 2019, 56 partnerships were established to assist States with their migration management
policies and systems to implement well-administered visa and entry schemes. Another 15 partnerships
were established to assist governments in support of legal pathways for migration, and 12 agreements
were signed to facilitate the verification of visa-related documentation.

101.       Engagement with local and regional authorities is a growing area of IOM’s work, building on
their first-hand experience in addressing migration opportunities and challenges. In 2019, 127 offices
partnered with local authorities or departmental entities. In Malawi, IOM partnerships with various
-----------------------Page 23 End-----------------------

Page 16


government ministries led to the development of the national migration policy, the establishment of
an interministerial steering committee on migration management and the inclusion of migrants in the
national strategy on sexual and reproductive health rights and HIV for the period 2019–2023.

102.      The Organization also continued to play an active part in highlighting the role of local
authorities in migration governance, and in supporting policy dialogue among cities and promoting
their contribution to international forums. For example, IOM experience and good practices on urban
migration were showcased at various global multilateral forums, the World Urban Forum and the
GFMD Summit, which, for the first time, included the Mayoral Forum on Human Mobility, Migration
and Development, with the support of the Mayors Mechanism, co-steered by IOM.

103.     IOM is also ensuring that local authorities are represented by including networks of them in
Core Working Groups 2.1 and 2.2 established under the United Nations Network on Migration and in
the Network’s Thematic Working Group 6 on developing an improved common understanding of safe
and inclusive access to services for migrants.

Civil society partners and actors

104.      IOM works with civil society actors on a broad range of migration issues at national, regional
and global level, and the number of its offices engaging with civil society has increased steadily. In
2019, 93 per cent of offices confirmed such engagement, mostly with NGOs, but also with local
societies of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, researchers and research
institutions, philanthropic foundations and funds, trade unions and professional associations, and
non-profit media organizations.

105.      Not only has the number of civil society interlocutors increased, the nature of the
engagement has also diversified. In 2019, implementing partnerships, capacity-building and policy
dialogue were among the three most frequent types of engagement, including within the context of
the IASC. The Organization also engaged with civil society on research.

106.       Most IOM offices reported relying on civil society to expand access to beneficiaries and
communities, to enable more informed and effective programming, to raise local/grass-roots
awareness, and for advocacy and capacity-building. For instance, in Colombia, IOM worked closely with
civil society to assist migrants and returnees from the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela; in
South Sudan, it coordinated with various national and international NGOs on Ebola preparedness; and
in Belarus, it established a platform for CSOs and government counterparts to discuss necessary
legislative changes aimed at countering human trafficking.

107.      Three information-sharing sessions were held with civil society interlocutors at IOM
Headquarters. Participants attended the sessions in-person or virtually and exchanged information
and their initiatives on the United Nations Network on Migration; migration challenges and the
situation of Venezuelan nationals; and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.

Private sector

108.      The Organization continued to enhance its private sector engagement, with 65 offices
actively engaging with the private sector in over 50 countries. Over 145 engagements with the private
sector were maintained, including partnerships and collaboration for knowledge and information
exchange, expertise provision, policy dialogues, joint collaboration for innovation, advocacy and grant-
based donations for IOM programmatic priorities. Moreover, 64 offices included the private sector in
their regional or country strategies.
-----------------------Page 24 End-----------------------

                                                                                              C/111/5
                                                                                              Page 17


109.     In Bahrain, for example, IOM engaged with a multinational soft drinks company on the
development of a safer recruitment toolkit that uses blockchain-based technology, which aims to
promote ethical recruitment practices. In Peru and Colombia, IOM partnered with Citi Foundation to
provide vocational training and certifications to more than 400 young Venezuelans to enhance their
employability and entrepreneurial skills. The partnership also created an incubator for mixed
entrepreneurial ventures comprising Venezuelans, Colombian returnees and host community
members. In Romania, IOM partnered with a global home rental platform to provide housing to
refugees being resettled in Romania, as part of the Organization’s refugee resettlement programme.

110.      In 2019, IOM launched three pilot fundraising campaigns for online donors to tap into new
donor markets and leverage emerging trends. During Ramadan, a call for action to donate to IOM was
promoted through a video campaign in the Middle East and North Africa and selected Gulf Cooperation
Council countries, reaching nearly 24 million users on social media. As part of initiatives to engage
external audiences and attract potential donors, IOM’s first-ever “mobile-first campaign” on climate
migration was developed ahead of the United Nations 2019 Climate Action Summit, reaching nearly
11.7 million social media and web users. Towards the end of the year, a photoessay-based online
campaign on winterization was launched in six languages in Europe and North America, reaching
15 million social media users. In addition to external-facing campaigns, IOM also invested in revising
internal processes and mechanisms to mainstream the collection, allocation and disbursement of
funds collected from online donors. This included changing the legal terms and conditions for the
collection of online donations, setting up new internal financial allocation processes, streamlining
donor management and outreach, and providing support to IOM staff to better engage in diaspora,
country-based or peer-to-peer fundraising.

Partnerships with diaspora and transnational communities

111.     Diaspora and transnational communities have been recognized as important contributors to
the development of both their countries of origin and the countries in which they reside. IOM supports
a comprehensive approach centred on “3Es for action” – engage, enable and empower – to maximize
the transnational exchange of diaspora resources.

112.      To capitalize on new communication and information-sharing opportunities, IOM continued
to develop its digital initiative for engaging with transnational communities residing across the globe
and willing to support development in their countries or communities of origin. The virtual
collaboration platform, iDiaspora, welcomed new members in 2019 and continued to collate materials
related to effective practices for engaging with diasporas. Between January and December, there were
approximately 285,000 page views on the platform by approximately 188,000 visitors or users.

113.      The extent and nature of IOM’s diaspora-related support remained substantial and wide-
ranging. In 2019, 86 offices worked on diaspora engagement, which included conducting diaspora
mapping, supporting governments to develop policies and action plans for a more comprehensive and
consistent approach to partnering with their diaspora communities, and providing support to integrate
diaspora-related issues into existing policies and laws.

114.      In Ethiopia, for example, IOM facilitated entrepreneurship training and mentorship
programmes for diaspora communities to enhance their contributions to the development of the
private sector in their country of origin and in Ethiopia. In Zambia, IOM supported the establishment
of a diaspora coordination structure under the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to strengthen coordination
and regular engagement with the Zambian diaspora. In Azerbaijan, Côte d’Ivoire, Guinea-Bissau and
Lesotho, the Organization supported the Governments in enhancing communication with their
diasporas by organizing forums and other face-to-face meetings.

115.      In addition to supporting governments, IOM offices collaborated with diaspora communities
and organizations in activities not only related to development, but also humanitarian settings. During
the reporting period, 48 offices partnered directly with diaspora or transnational communities,
including professional networks, issue-based organizations and hometown associations. For example,
IOM partnered with diaspora associations in Italy to promote investment and job creation in Tunisia,
and initiated four partnership agreements with diaspora associations in Spain and Italy to implement
community-based projects in Guinea.

116.       Fifteen offices reported that they had engaged with diaspora or transnational communities
in relation to humanitarian issues. For example, in Argentina, IOM participated in meetings with
representatives of organizations of the Venezuelan community to assess humanitarian and integration
needs and discuss areas of cooperation. In the Bahamas, the Organization engaged with diaspora
groups to provide financial and advocacy support for Haitian migrants in situations of vulnerability. In
Ireland, it worked with a wide range of diaspora groups to ensure widespread understanding and
dissemination of materials on assisted voluntary return and reintegration among community
members. In Sierra Leone, it mapped skilled members of the Sierra Leonean diaspora who were willing
to support disaster response activities during emergencies.


OBJECTIVE 1: SOCIOECONOMIC WELL-BEING OF MIGRANTS AND SOCIETY

Safe and beneficial labour migration

117.      IOM provides policy assistance in labour mobility facilitation, with a focus on supporting
governments in the development and improvement of labour migration frameworks and practices. It
builds capacity and supports evidence-based policy development and a whole-of-government and
whole-of-society approach in labour and human mobility management. The Organization works with
governments, the private sector, United Nations agencies and other stakeholders to enhance labour
mobility management capacities. This includes the promotion of professional, transparent and
efficient recruitment, based on high ethical standards and the “employer pays principle”, and of
employment systems based on reliable data.

118.       In 2019, 94 offices collaborated with governments to develop or improve labour migration
frameworks and practices. For instance, in Kenya, IOM worked with the National Employment
Authority to provide assistance in developing a pre-departure orientation handbook for Kenyan
nationals seeking employment abroad, launched in April. In Trinidad and Tobago, IOM provided
technical assistance and capacity-building support to the Government which resulted in the
development of a draft policy on labour migration. In Australia, it worked with the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs to develop a reintegration strategy for labour migrants returning from Australia to their country
of origin.

119.     The Organization provides policy expertise on ethical recruitment and labour supply chain
mapping to a range of stakeholders. Sixty-three offices reported that they had worked with
governments, the private sector, CSOs and regional consultative processes on migration to raise
awareness, support the development of standards and practices that respect migrant workers’ rights,
and conduct assessments of labour supply chains. For instance, in the Philippines, IOM developed a
responsible recruitment due diligence toolkit for suppliers and recruitment agencies. In order to gain
a comprehensive understanding of recruitment practices in West Africa, the Organization also
conducted an exploratory study in Côte d’Ivoire, the Gambia, Ghana, Nigeria and Senegal.

120.      In 2019, IOM engaged in advocacy and awareness-raising in 43 countries to promote IRIS, its
ethical recruitment tool for governments, businesses and workers. This advocacy included global and
-----------------------Page 26 End-----------------------

                                                                                               C/111/5
                                                                                               Page 19


regional events with policymakers and regulators to promote effective regulation of international
recruitment. Two conferences were held that resulted in regional and global commitments: one in
Uganda, which led to the publishing and regional distribution of joint recommendations on priority
actions to strengthen the regulation of international recruitment and protection of migrant workers;
and one in Canada, which enabled exchanges on challenges, opportunities and good practices on cross-
border labour recruitment and led to the development of global policy recommendations.

121.      In cooperation with the ILO, the Organization also developed a preliminary stocktaking study
on the development and implementation of bilateral labour migration agreements by African Union
Member States. The study included an overview of the situation and recommendations for
governments, employers, trade unions, United Nations organizations and other actors. It was
complemented by an assessment tool pilot, which was tested in the African region for the
development, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of the agreements. IOM also became co-
lead, with the ILO, of a new thematic working group on bilateral labour migration agreements in the
context of the United Nations Network on Migration.

122.     In addition to supporting governments with technical advice and assistance, 53 offices
provided direct assistance to labour migrants or migrant jobseekers during the reporting period, which
included pre-departure orientation, broader counselling and referrals.

123.     Thirty-five offices also reported that they had seen significant improvements in effective
labour migration frameworks and schemes contributing to gender equality. One example is PROMISE,
a multi-country initiative to promote better employment opportunities and working conditions in
Thailand for migrants, especially women, from Cambodia, the Lao People’s Democratic Republic and
Myanmar; it also supports migrants who decide to return to their country of origin.

Promoting social, economic and cultural inclusion of migrants

124.       IOM is committed to promoting the social, economic and cultural inclusion of migrants by
reinforcing a two-way integration process, which is essential for fostering diverse and cohesive
societies.

125.      Training provides migrants with critical information about destination countries and
identifies the skills they will need to succeed, whether in the workplace or their new communities. In
2019, IOM implemented more than 37 migrant training projects that benefited migrants from more
than 90 countries.

126.       The Organization continued to develop the Joint Global Initiative on Diversity, Inclusion and
Social Cohesion, a platform for IOM offices to learn, share and develop innovative strategies and
initiatives to support Members States in promoting migrant inclusion and social cohesion. During the
year, a series of workshops were held that brought together IOM experts to identify elements of a
common approach to migrant inclusion and social cohesion and share good practices. In close
collaboration with the UK Home Office and local councils across the United Kingdom, a handbook on
developing evidence-based strategies and interventions to promote migrant integration was
developed for global replication.

127.       In total, 130 offices promoted integration and the social, economic and cultural inclusion of
migrants in host countries, with national governments, CSOs, regional and local authorities and NGOs.
For instance, in Bosnia and Herzegovina, IOM promoted integration and exchanges between migrants
and host populations by engaging them in various educational, sporting and cultural activities. In
Cabo Verde, it supported the Government to improve and modernize the residence permit process,
facilitating the documentation process for migrants in the country. In Uruguay, it worked with the
-----------------------Page 27 End-----------------------

C/111/5
Page 20


Government and NGOs to help migrant beneficiaries join the Uruguayan labour market. In the
United Kingdom, the Organization worked with host communities and volunteers to support refugees
to better prepare for early labour market integration by providing them with skill profiles.

128.      Furthermore, 99 offices provided various types of direct support to migrant beneficiaries. For
example, in Armenia, Bangladesh, Cameroon and Panama, IOM provided grants and support to
migrants for setting up micro-businesses. In Ethiopia and Kazakhstan, it provided legal aid services to
migrants through consortium partners. In Greece, in order to promote social, economic and cultural
inclusion, IOM provided migrants with rental subsidies for housing, legal counselling and support for
the issuance of administrative documents, support for job searching and access to cultural activities
near and within camps ensuring participation of local communities, among other things. In the Niger,
IOM provided training on business management and agricultural practices for migrants staying in the
transit centre in Agadez while they awaited their voluntary return.

129.      Gender dimensions were also considered while promoting the inclusion of migrants. For
example, in Bahrain, IOM implemented the Comprehensive Information and Orientation Programme,
which helped female migrant workers to integrate into their workplace and host community. In
Argentina, IOM conducted a participatory assessment to identify gender-related barriers to
empowerment and self-sufficiency for girl and women migrants from the Syrian Arab Republic. The
assessment findings informed the design and implementation of workshops on women’s rights, sexual
and reproductive health, gender-based violence and access to assistance for victims of gender-based
violence.

130.      The Organization also bolstered its efforts towards improving the public perception of
migrants, with 60 offices extensively using social media and 48 offices providing direct support to
community events. Other initiatives included support for the Fernando Pacheco Jordão Young
Journalist Award in Brazil, podcasts on migration in Egypt, an art exhibition to promote the positive
perception of migrants in Germany, the photo exhibition Pour Tout l’Or du Monde (For All the Gold in
the World) in Senegal documenting the plight of artisanal gold miners in West Africa, co-organizing
with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan the International Forum on Acceptance of Foreign
Nationals and Their Integration into Japan, and organizing concerts showcasing the diversity of
communities in the United Kingdom. In Austria, an IOM initiative supported Chechen youth to produce
videos on their experiences as migrants and the challenges they faced.

131.      The IOM Global Migration Film Festival, in its fourth year in 2019, provides an opportunity to
humanize the conversation on migration, to debunk myths and address misconceptions. In the
three weeks leading up to International Migrants Day 2019, more than 700 screenings were organized
by IOM regional and country offices in 108 countries, attracting a combined audience of around
60,000 people. Many of the screenings included panel discussions on social cohesion, where migrants,
community leaders, government representatives and IOM partners discussed successful efforts to
build bridges between migrants and host communities.

132.     The Organization continued to support the establishment and management of various
migrant resource centres. During the year, 49 new centres were set up by IOM, 42 were managed by
IOM and 26 were institutionalized and operated without IOM’s financial support.

Improving financial and economic well-being of migrants and members of their families

133.     Another important policy area for IOM is migrant socioeconomic empowerment, in particular
through financial literacy, which contributes to the economic, health and educational well-being of
migrants and their families, thereby catalysing development in their home countries. In 52 countries,
IOM focused on enhancing financial literacy among migrant populations by informing them about the
-----------------------Page 28 End-----------------------

                                                                                               C/111/5
                                                                                               Page 21


importance of financial well-being, improving their knowledge of the financial gains from migration
and raising awareness about how to access additional finances. This was supplemented through
working directly with financial providers and stakeholders on increased availability of gender-sensitive
services and products to migrant households.


       Activities to improve financial and economic well-being of migrants and their families




134.      IOM contributed to improving the financial and economic well-being of migrants and
members of their families by engaging with government and other stakeholders through advocacy
efforts on reducing remittance costs, and by collecting evidence on the impact of human mobility and
migration on migrants, members of their families and related communities. Efforts were made to help
reduce remittance costs to below 3 per cent, as per the related SDG indicator. This included providing
technical assistance through reviewing and contributing to the improvement of legislation and
regulatory frameworks, supporting practical and innovative schemes, and improving market
transparency by sharing information on and identifying the best money transfer options. In addition,
the remittance cost comparison feature in the MigApp mobile application continued to provide real-
time information on the cheapest options for sending money within a specific corridor.

135.      In the area of entrepreneurship, IOM, in partnership with UNHCR and the United Nations
Conference on Trade and Development, worked on several initiatives to build on the joint publication
Policy Guide on Entrepreneurship for Migrants and Refugees. The Policy Guide was made more
accessible through the development of an e-learning course entitled Entrepreneurship for Migrants
and Refugees, for which the three entities also received assistance from the United Nations Institute
for Training and Research. In addition, several national awareness-raising workshops were held,
primarily in South America and West Asia.

Countering trafficking in persons, migrant exploitation and abuse

136.      IOM has been addressing human trafficking and migrant exploitation and abuse for decades.
In 2019, 149 offices worked in this area. In partnership with governments, the United Nations,
international and non-governmental organizations, the private sector and development partners,
IOM’s anti-trafficking responses encompass all aspects of the United Nations Global Plan of Action to
Combat Trafficking in Persons. The issue of migrant children and the appropriate response to their care
and protection needs continued to gain prominence. Hence, among the IOM offices working in this
thematic area, 77 targeted migrant children as beneficiaries of anti-trafficking interventions.

137.       The nature of interventions ranged from technical assistance, capacity-building and data
collection to outreach and household programming. Other forms of engagement included the
facilitation of study visits to exchange good practices for countering trafficking in persons for
government authorities in Burundi and Kenya, supporting the Government of the Niger to open the
first shelter for victims of trafficking in Zinder, and working with embassies to organize awareness-
raising events in Timor-Leste.

138.       Seventy offices developed materials on prevention and the protection of victims of trafficking
and other migrants in situations of vulnerability, while 41,209 officials were trained on protection and
anti-trafficking measures, the majority of whom were service providers, law enforcement officials or
community leaders.

139.      In many countries, IOM training and technical assistance helped to strengthen the
identification, referral and protection of trafficked persons, or to improve anti-trafficking legislation
and its implementation. For example, in Cyprus, IOM liaised with the social welfare services to provide
support and capacity-building and improve the national referral mechanism. In Bahrain, IOM
supported the development of a national strategy and action plan to combat trafficking in persons.

140.      In Bangladesh, IOM provided protection and assistance in 3,568 protection cases. It also
engaged over 111,000 women and girls in psychosocial support activities and conducted sessions on
the risk of gender-based violence which reached 46,620 people. In Belarus, IOM worked with UNICEF
to launch a new campaign, Teach Children to See Lies, aimed at preventing trafficking of children and
child sexual exploitation and sexual abuse. In Slovakia, a mobile application called Safe Work and Travel
Abroad was used to reach young people who could be at risk of trafficking.

141.      IOM has broad expertise in providing trafficked persons and other migrants vulnerable to
violence, exploitation and abuse with direct assistance, such as safe accommodation, legal aid, and
assisted voluntary return and reintegration. In 2019, it provided protection and assistance to
7,900 victims of trafficking and over 136,000 migrants vulnerable to violence, exploitation and abuse.
Examples of the services provided include relocation (pre-travel support, travel and transportation)
under the programme of the Government of Brazil for vulnerable migrants and refugees from the
Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela in the country, medical and psychosocial support in Mali, the Republic
of Moldova and Thailand, in-kind support for micro-business in Myanmar, and language courses,
cultural mediation and orientation sessions in Romania and Slovakia.

142.      Furthermore, the Organization has taken a global lead role in the expanding area of counter-
trafficking in humanitarian settings and general emergency contexts, through training, developing
learning materials, testing innovative means of data collection, and providing direct support to field
offices and inter-agency counter-trafficking forums. It deployed counter-trafficking experts to
emergency locations to provide technical assistance and case management support in the Central
African Republic and Chad, and in multiple border areas around the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela
and Ecuador. Through its DTM operations, IOM integrated trafficking-related and protection indicators

                                                                                               Page 23


into routine displacement surveys in Bangladesh (Cox’s Bazar), the Central African Republic, the Niger
and in countries neighbouring the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, thereby establishing trends and
providing an evidence base on trafficking in specific emergency contexts. The Organization also
established training materials on counter-trafficking for CCCM actors, validating the content through
two field test workshops with participants in north-eastern Nigeria and in Cox’s Bazar.

143.      IOM continued to play a lead role in the Anti-Trafficking in Humanitarian Action Task Team
under the Global Protection Cluster, both as a co-lead agency and in hosting the Secretariat. Through
the Task Team, operational guidance tools were developed and field tested through workshops in
north-eastern Nigeria, the Niger and South Sudan. IOM also conducted training with the two other co-
leads for external humanitarian protection actors in Ukraine and in two locations in Myanmar.

144.      With respect to counter-trafficking efforts, in Guinea-Bissau and the Lao People’s Democratic
Republic, the Organization advocated for increased government recognition and assistance for male
victims of trafficking.

Migration and health

145.      The IOM vision of “healthy migrants in healthy communities” is centred on four key
approaches: promoting migrants’ right to health; maintaining good public health outcomes for
individuals and communities; contributing to the positive health and development outcomes of
migration in countries of origin, transit and destination; and reducing health inequities.

146.      To this end, 117 IOM offices around the world were engaged in promoting the health of
migrants. Of these, 109 offices stated that the government made efforts to ensure access to migrant-
sensitive health services for all migrants without discrimination. Moreover, 61 offices reported that
the host government included data on migrant health in national surveys and statistics, and 29 host
governments shared these data with IOM. Furthermore, over 50 offices indicated that the government
had a migration health focal point to coordinate migration health issues among various arms of the
government.

147.      During the reporting period, 94 offices built the capacity of the host government and partners
on migration health. For example, in multiple countries, IOM built the capacities of health service
providers and border officials on migration health and health surveillance at borders. In Ethiopia, it
strengthened capacity on cross-border communicable disease control, while in Guinea-Bissau, the
Organization focused on cross-border health surveillance and the International Health Regulations
(2005) at points of entry. In Madagascar, it established epidemic-control health screening points.

148.      In Malta, IOM built capacities of law enforcement officers and social workers, focusing on
areas such as intercultural competencies, health needs, challenges and risks among migrants and
refugees, mental health and psychosocial support. It also strengthened capacity on mental health and
psychosocial support for migrants and psychological first aid in various countries, for example in
Argentina, Colombia, Côte d’Ivoire, the Marshall Islands, Nicaragua and Thailand. In Timor-Leste, IOM
worked with community health volunteers and other stakeholders to implement systematic screening
for tuberculosis among high-risk groups. In Sri Lanka, it supported the National Tuberculosis Reference
Laboratory for capacity-building in quality assurance management through a study visit to Bangkok.

149.      The Organization also advocated for migrant-sensitive health services with governments and
partners. In 2019, 91 offices were involved in such efforts. Seventy-four offices also engaged directly
with migrants and local communities to raise awareness about migration and health-related issues,
including available services, migrants’ right to health, mental health, sexual and reproductive health
and rights, outbreak response and disease prevention.

150.      Furthermore, IOM engaged in regional and country-level policy engagements on migration
and health. For example, in Ethiopia, it led advocacy and consultations with the Government and other
stakeholders on mainstreaming migrant health service delivery in local and national programmes,
especially for vulnerable migrants. In Southern Africa, it organized a preliminary session on migration
health on the margins of the Ministerial Conference of the Southern African Development Community,
held in Windhoek. The main outcomes of the session were key recommendations for action by
member countries in the next five years. IOM also took part in the annual Migration Dialogue for
Southern Africa event, also held in Windhoek, which had three recommendations on migration health
governance, endorsed by attending ministers.

151.      IOM organized various events to promote migration health within relevant United Nations
forums and to bring together a multisectoral coalition of government, United Nations and civil society
partners and academia. For instance, it co-organized and led a discussion on policy coherence in
migration health on the margins of the Fifty-second Session of the Commission on Population and
Development, held in New York. The event enabled the sharing of experiences, challenges and
evidence from good practices to contribute to an evidence-informed discourse on migration health at
key United Nations discussions, including the high-level political forum on sustainable development,
held in July, and the high-level meeting on universal health coverage, held in September. The Political
declaration of the high-level meeting on universal health coverage refers to migrants and issues such
as complex emergencies and climate change as elements to be taken into account in efforts towards
achieving universal health coverage (and other health-related SDGs).

152.     In 2019, 86 IOM offices provided direct health services to migrants and local communities.
Through a regional project in Southern Africa, by the end of the year, over 320,000 migrants,
adolescents, young people and sex workers in migration-affected communities were provided with
sexual and reproductive health/HIV services and information.

Migration, the environment and climate change

153.      IOM seeks to promote stronger coherence between policies and practices related to
migration, the environment and climate change through the integration of migration considerations in
climate change, environmental, sustainable development and disaster risk reduction policies and
strategies; and the inclusion of environmental and climate change concerns in migration policies.

154.       By 2019, 77 offices addressed the migration, environment and climate change nexus by
organizing and/or participating in national policy dialogues and events and awareness-raising
initiatives, building evidence through research and data collection and supporting States by building
capacities, influencing key policy processes related to environmental migration and assisting in the
development of policies on environmental migration.

155.      Also in relation to the migration, environment and climate change nexus and/or
environmentally sustainable practices, the Organization built the capacity of 5,262 individuals,
including national and local government officials, community leaders, CSO and NGO staff and private
sector officials.

156.      In addition to capacity-building, IOM influenced key global and regional policy processes
related to environmental migration and assisted Member States in developing policies in this area. At
global level, the Organization provided technical support to the UNFCCC Task Force on Displacement,
notably by organizing the official workshop dedicated to the development of the Task Force’s two-year
action plan. At country level, in Zimbabwe, for instance, IOM advocated for the inclusion of the
migration and climate change nexus into the national migration policy.
-----------------------Page 32 End-----------------------

                                                                                                                   C/111/5
                                                                                                                   Page 25


157.      At regional level, IOM worked with partners, including other United Nations agencies, to
launch a multi-country project on enhancing protection and empowerment of migrants and
communities affected by climate change and disasters in the Pacific region. In South America, the
Organization published research on the integration of human mobility in climate strategies in the
region. Similarly, in Asia and the Pacific, IOM provided technical support to countries to take into
account human mobility considerations when developing climate change policies, including national
adaptation plans, displacement policy frameworks and relocation guidelines.

158.     IOM also organized a number of high-level events in both Geneva and New York throughout
the reporting period. For example, it co-organized, with the Permanent Missions of Portugal and Fiji
to the United Nations in New York, a high-level ministerial breakfast meeting on migration and climate
change, with a focus on small island developing States, in the margins of the United Nations General
Assembly and the 2019 Climate Action Summit. It also organized the side event entitled Moving
Forward Together: Averting, Minimizing and Addressing Displacement – The Second Phase of the Task
Force on Displacement, at the Twenty-fifth session of the Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC.

159.       The Organization continued to actively engage with Member States, the United Nations and
civil society partners in this area of its work. In March, IOM briefed Member and observer States on its
priorities on migration, the environment and climate change. It also worked closely with the State-led
Platform on Disaster Displacement, with which it co-organized several global events, to support
implementation of the Nansen Initiative Protection Agenda.

160.     To advance knowledge and evidence on the migration, environment and climate change
nexus, IOM released key publications and internal documents, including Climate Change and Migration
in Vulnerable Countries, published jointly with the United Nations Office of the High Representative
for the Least Developed Countries, Landlocked Developing Countries and Small Island Developing
States, and Addressing the Land Degradation–Migration Nexus: The Role of the United Nations
Convention to Combat Desertification, published with UNCCD. IOM also launched several
communication–fundraising campaigns, such as the #FindAWay and #DoTheRightThing campaigns
focused on migration, the environment and climate change.

Reintegration

161.      Providing reintegration assistance to migrants returning to their country of origin is an
essential component of the Organization’s approach to return migration, both for assisted voluntary
return operated by IOM and for returns operated by other stakeholders. Through its integrated
approach to reintegration, IOM promotes sustainable reintegration that considers economic, social
and psychosocial elements across the individual, community and structural levels.

162.      In 2019, 112 offices were involved in reintegration activities either prior to return in the host
country or upon arrival in the country of origin. In total, 126,442 reintegration-related services were
provided to returnees either before departure (8%) or after arrival (92%). Services, such as counselling
or economic, social and psychosocial assistance, were provided at the individual (88%), collective
(9%) and community (3%) levels. Ninety-eight per cent of services were provided by IOM and the other
2 per cent through referrals. Reintegration services were delivered to migrants whose return was
organized by IOM or by other actors, such as governments or NGOs. Of the returns organized by other
actors, 32 per cent were forced returns and 2 per cent were returns considered as voluntary by other
stakeholders.3

    IOM strongly believes that voluntary return is preferable to forced return, as it gives migrants a choice and enables them
    to prepare for return, thus positively impacting their reintegration process. However, IOM also assists forcibly returned
    migrants, for whom reintegration assistance is equally necessary to rebuild a life once back in their country of origin.
-----------------------Page 33 End-----------------------

C/111/5
Page 26


163.       IOM further operationalized its integrated approach to reintegration through the launch of
the Reintegration Handbook and the development of a related training curriculum. These tools provide
practical guidance on the design, implementation and monitoring of reintegration assistance for IOM
staff, policymakers and other reintegration practitioners globally.

164.      In December, the Organization also launched the Return and Reintegration Platform, a global
tool for disseminating knowledge and good practices in the field of migrant return and reintegration.
It was developed by the knowledge management hub, established by IOM in 2017, and funded by the
European Union under its project entitled Pilot Action on Voluntary Return and Sustainable,
Community-based Reintegration.

165.      The capacity of local actors in countries of origin were also strengthened to support
reintegration. Seventy-eight offices facilitated dialogue and/or capacity-building on reintegration
management at local, regional and international level, with a wide range of stakeholders, including
governments, NGOs, other United Nations agencies, the media, academia and the private sector. For
instance, in El Salvador, IOM provided technical support to municipal governments to set up offices
focused on providing reintegration support and referrals. In Finland, it conducted reintegration
sustainability monitoring aimed at providing evidence-based information on the sustainability of
reintegration of beneficiaries from Finland, which can be used by relevant stakeholders in the country
when making policy and programmatic decisions in this area.


OBJECTIVE 2: MOBILITY DIMENSION OF CRISES

Crisis preparedness

166.       The Organization continued to strengthen its capacity to anticipate and respond promptly to
crises. At global level, the internal Emergency Preparedness Monitoring Report was issued biannually,
in line with the IASC Early Warning, Early Action and Readiness Report. This internal report enables
IOM to contribute more effectively to inter-agency risk monitoring and preparedness efforts.

167.      In 2019, IOM launched an upgraded roster of experts, a repository of vetted experts who
possess the skill sets needed for the Organization’s various sectors of emergency response. By the end
of the year, the roster contained 315 active experts.

168.    At field level, 62 country offices reported having contributed to inter-agency emergency
preparedness activities. For example, in Cox’s Bazar, IOM worked with the Inter-Sector Coordination
Group and developed a cyclone preparedness and response plan.

169.      The first IOM Global Pre-positioning Strategy was disseminated to improve efficiency,
timeliness and the quality and costs of supplies. Looking towards 2021, the Strategy builds on existing
strategic partnerships and is closely integrated and harmonized with country-level supply chain
processes.

170.     To meet beneficiary needs, global stocks were released 18 times from the warehouses in
Manila, Nairobi and Panama to 11 country offices (Bahamas, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Democratic
Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Mozambique, Papua New Guinea, Philippines, Somalia, Yemen
Zimbabwe). Offices greatly benefited from the quicker procurement process made possible by pre-
positioned stocks. Fifteen long-term agreements were in place for the replenishment of global stocks.

171.     To strengthen humanitarian operations in the East and Horn of Africa, the fourth IOM quality
control centre was established in Nairobi, following those in Manila, Gaziantep and Juba. Quality
-----------------------Page 34 End-----------------------

                                                                                                C/111/5
                                                                                                Page 27


management procedures were introduced at the IOM Offices in Kenya, the Philippines, Turkey and
South Sudan, and best practices were collected during a workshop in Manila and training at the
Regional Office in Nairobi.

172.      The development of guidance tools and training continued to be critical in fortifying the
Organization’s knowledge management and capacity-building efforts, as well as in improving
institutional structures and processes. Capacity-building events on CCCM were held at the national and
subnational levels in 24 countries, benefiting camp managers, community governance structures,
partners and local authorities. A total of 281 training sessions were conducted across the world,
attended by 7,271 people. The CCCM training programmes continued to integrate actions to address
gender-based violence.

173.      The Emergency Response Induction Training, IOM’s institutional programme on principled
and accountable crisis response for staff and standby partners working in crisis settings, was held in
Nairobi in June, with 32 participants from 27 country offices. This training builds the Organization’s
capacity to effectively scale up and respond to crises by expanding the pool of qualified staff who can
be deployed to support emergency operations. Training on resources management in emergencies
was also organized in Turkey in November for 15 Resources Management Officers from various
regions. The overarching goal of this training was to strengthen the managerial and technical capacity
of mid-level Officers and prepare them to assume a higher level of responsibility, particularly in
emergency response settings.

174.      With a 260 per cent increase in CCCM operations incorporating the use of cash-based
interventions in 2019, IOM began developing a guide for camp managers on cash-based interventions,
which will also mainstream prevention and mitigation of associated protection and gender-based
violence risks. As co-lead of the Global CCCM Cluster, IOM also pursued efforts to foster actions to
address gender-based violence in displacement settings. IOM was appointed co-lead of the Global
CCCM Cluster Working Group on Participation in Displacement, together with the Norwegian Refugee
Council.

Crisis response

175.      Crisis response remained one of the largest areas of intervention for the Organization. Crisis-
related programming remained stable, reaching over 28 million people in more than 75 countries.
During the year, IOM had a corporate Level 3 mechanism for four protracted emergencies, namely in
Bangladesh, Nigeria, the Syrian Arab Republic and Yemen. This mechanism was also activated to scale
up response to Cyclones Idai and Kenneth in Mozambique and to the Ebola crisis in the Democratic
Republic of the Congo. The Level 3 emergencies for Bangladesh and Nigeria were deactivated in July,
while the corporate emergency response to the cyclones in Mozambique was terminated at the end
of the year.

176.      The Organization continued its role in inter-agency coordination of humanitarian assistance
and was engaged in 74 clusters, sectoral coordination and/or working groups in 39 countries. In several
operational contexts (e.g. Bangladesh, Colombia, South Sudan, Sudan, Turkey, Yemen), IOM had a
stronger role, leading multiple sectoral coordination mechanisms. It led or co-led 17 CCCM
coordination platforms; 23 shelter and NFI coordination mechanisms, of which 3 were merged into
CCCM and shelter platforms (in Chad, Zimbabwe and Nigeria); 13 inter-agency migrant and refugee
response platforms; and 21 other types of coordination platforms across different sectors, including
cash-based interventions, health, protection and information management. When the Organization
coordinated CCCM sectors, it had dedicated staff for coordination (80% cases), for information
management (100% of cases) and both areas (80% of cases). Globally, the Organization contributed to
17 of the 21 inter-agency humanitarian response appeals.
-----------------------Page 35 End-----------------------

177.     Additionally, IOM data continued to be frequently shared with humanitarian actors to inform
their responses. The DTM was used in 81 per cent of the humanitarian needs overviews and
humanitarian response plans as one of the main sources of data and analysis for internal displacement.

178.      The Migration Emergency Funding Mechanism was activated eight times in 2019, with a total
disbursement of USD 2.2 million. It was used to quickly respond to humanitarian needs related to the
Ebola outbreak, particularly in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Burundi, as well as to
Cyclones Idai and Kenneth in Malawi, Mozambique and Zimbabwe and Hurricane Dorian in the
Bahamas. An allocation from the Mechanism was also granted to support voluntary returns from
South Africa to Mozambique following xenophobic attacks. The disbursement of advanced internal
funding in anticipation of donor contributions enabled IOM to respond in a timely and flexible manner
to complex humanitarian crises, while resources were mobilized.

179.      In 2019, IOM finalized its protection in humanitarian action road map outlining major
operational pillars and core commitments of protection programming. The Organization’s protection
intervention in humanitarian settings reached 32 countries.

180.      DTM operations continued to pursue the integration of protection and gender-based
violence indicators. As standard procedure, the DTM generates data disaggregated by sex and age. As
of June, 85 per cent of active DTM operations had protection (gender-based violence and/or child
protection) indicators integrated into data collection activities, encouraging joint analyses with
protection experts and further development of data-sharing mechanisms with protection partners.

181.      The Organization advanced its efforts to mainstream gender-based violence prevention and
risk mitigation into its emergency response. It continued to roll out and operationalize the Institutional
Framework for Addressing Gender-based Violence in Crises and developed a toolkit to guide staff on
integrating measures to address gender-based violence. Gender-based violence and health teams
were also engaged to work together and explore how to better support gender-based violence
survivors, leading to the development of guidance and tools.

182.      A WASH monitoring, evaluation and learning framework was developed aimed at
strengthening WASH knowledge management. The package included multiple tools, such as the WASH
project design and monitoring tool, which have been shared with country offices for piloting purposes.

183.       The Organization consistently endeavours to place persons with disabilities at the centre of
humanitarian responses. For instance, the Women’s Participation Project included women with
disabilities in mechanisms to increase their representation in decision-making in camp and camp-like
settings; in Cox’s Bazar, IOM teamed up with the Centre for Disability in Development, a disability rights
organization, to deliver home-based rehabilitation for refugees with disabilities; and the disability
inclusion strategy of the IOM Office in Iraq aims to ensure that persons with disabilities are equitably
included in and consulted on the Office’s activities.

Camp coordination and camp management

184.     The Organization’s CCCM activities took place across 33 countries, with IOM holding
coordination roles in 17 crisis responses. By the end of the year, the Organization’s CCCM operations
had reached almost 2.4 million people in more than 1,295 camps and camp-like settings in
28 countries.

185.     In line with the Grand Bargain, IOM, in its role as the Global CCCM Cluster co-lead, worked
with the Global Education Cluster, the Child Protection Area of Responsibility and the Gender-based
-----------------------Page 36 End-----------------------

                                                                                               C/111/5
                                                                                               Page 29


Violence Area of Responsibility to facilitate the work of the Task Team on Localization, in coordination
with the Global Cluster Coordination Group, and was key in drafting a guidance note for cluster
coordinators. IOM also worked to strengthen its efforts in localization by working through and building
capacity of local partners and initiated a pilot project to localize the CCCM framework and standards
in Indonesia, the first of three target countries. In 2019, 50 per cent of IOM CCCM operations were
carried out through national implementing partners.

186.      The Women’s Participation Project continued to be implemented, for example in Bangladesh,
Nigeria and South Sudan. IOM also collaborated with the Women’s Refugee Commission in
South Sudan to adapt, pilot and improve the “I’m here” operational approach to adolescent
engagement in the Wau Protection of Civilian Adjacent Area IDP Camp. This was the first time that a
CCCM actor tested the implementation of such a tool and IOM is looking at its replicability in other
contexts.

Shelter and non-food items

187.      IOM set up new shelter and NFI operations in response to displacements in Ethiopia, Cyclones
Idai and Kenneth in Malawi, Mozambique and Zimbabwe and Hurricane Dorian in the Bahamas. It also
significantly scaled up operations in Ethiopia, Nigeria and the Syrian Arab Republic. Over 70 per cent
of IOM’s shelter and NFI support targeted populations affected by the crises in Bangladesh, Ethiopia,
Mozambique, Nigeria, South Sudan and the Syrian Arab Republic.

188.       The Organization continued to play an important role in the Strategic Advisory Group of the
Global Shelter Cluster. It maintained its lead role in the Shelter Projects Working Group, co-led the
Inclusion of Persons with Disabilities in Shelter Programming Working Group and delivered key
activities for the Promoting Safer Building Working Group. Furthermore, IOM provided critical global
capacity on land tenure issues by hosting the Housing, Land and Property Adviser to the Global Shelter
Cluster, who completed 10 missions in support of shelter cluster partners in the Democratic Republic
of the Congo, Ethiopia, Indonesia, Mozambique and Nigeria.

189.      With various partners, IOM co-organized the first inter-agency settlement planning training
to strengthen the technical skills of site planning experts on gender, gender-based violence and
environmental concerns, and to contribute to building the global evidence base on how these issues
can be addressed from a settlement-planning perspective. This was followed by field training of
trainers in Beira, Mozambique.

Gender-based violence mainstreaming in humanitarian operations

190.      Throughout 2019, IOM continued to participate in the Gender-based Violence Area of
Responsibility and to strengthen its coordination, information management and operational
capacities, hosting its Global Information Manager and supporting the deployment of two Regional
Emergency Gender-based Violence Advisers. Furthermore, IOM continued to host a training specialist
on behalf of the Reference Group supporting implementation of the IASC Guidelines for Integrating
Gender-based Violence Interventions in Humanitarian Action.

191.     IOM, UNICEF and the Gender-based Violence Area of Responsibility organized a stocktaking
workshop on gender-based violence risk mitigation for global and national CCCM/WASH/shelter and
gender-based violence clusters/sector coordinators from Bangladesh, Iraq, Nigeria, Somalia and
South Sudan.

Water, sanitation and hygiene

192.      IOM WASH programming reached a record number of beneficiaries in 2019, assisting
6.7 million people in 27 countries. As a result of these interventions, 2.8 million people received clean
water, 937,000 people gained access to safe latrines, 1.5 million people benefited from other
sanitation-related activities, and safe hygiene was promoted for 2.3 million people.

193.     IOM also joined the Global WASH Cluster’s Faecal Sludge Management Working Group. As a
member of UN-Water, the Organization contributed to the development of the UN-Water
2030 Strategy (for release in 2020) and provided inputs for the World Water Development Report
2019, Leaving No One Behind, published in March.

Cash-based interventions

194.      Cash-based interventions were carried out in 28 countries and reached over
900,000 beneficiaries, a 26 per cent increase from 2018. The largest cash-based intervention
programmes were in Afghanistan, Bangladesh, the Central African Republic, Chad, Ethiopia, Iraq,
Serbia, South Sudan, Turkey and Yemen.

195.      In accordance with the Grand Bargain commitments and the IOM Strategy for Humanitarian
Cash-based Interventions (2019–2021), IOM established a team at Headquarters to build institutional
capacity to use cash-based interventions as a modality for the delivery of humanitarian assistance.
Several new tools were developed, including a cash-based interventions risk management matrix,
guidance on cash-for-work activities and guidance on the design of post-distribution monitoring
exercises. Simultaneously, significant steps were taken towards reviewing internal financial and
administrative systems against the requirements for cash-based interventions to produce a
standardized method to monitor and report on cash and voucher-related expenses across the
Organization.

196.      To enhance the quality of its cash-based interventions at country level, IOM produced
literature reviews addressing a variety of cross-cutting themes, such as gender, disability inclusion,
gender-based violence and cash-based interventions in armed conflict. Knowledge management was
enhanced by establishing an online institutional repository of validated tools, guidance and document
samples used by various offices and lessons learned on cash-based interventions.

Health in emergencies

197.      Through its health response in humanitarian settings and its response to public health
emergencies, the Organization aims to save lives, reduce morbidity and alleviate suffering, while
upholding humanitarian principles and protecting human dignity. In 2019, 43 offices conducted
emergency health planning, including health education/promotion, referrals, disease outbreak
surveillance and response, direct health service provision and vaccinations. Some examples of IOM
support in this area included ambulance services in Cox’s Bazar, voluntary counselling and HIV testing
in Jordan, tuberculosis awareness-raising and screening in Lebanon, and direct health services and
assessments, especially for victims of trafficking, in Trinidad and Tobago. During the Ebola outbreak in
the Democratic Republic of the Congo, IOM supported cross-border coordination and preparedness
and response in the country and neighbouring countries in East Africa.

198.     Furthermore, the number of migration health projects that included sexual and reproductive
health activities increased by over 20 per cent, with 19 new projects in 2019.
-----------------------Page 38 End-----------------------

                                                                                               C/111/5
                                                                                               Page 31


Surge support

199.      In 2019, 53 staff were involved in 250 deployments to 61 country operations for a total of
2,558 staff days, averaging 10 days per deployment and 48 days of deployment on average per staff
member. Compared to 2018, there was a slight decrease in the number of experts in the pool of staff
deployed by IOM to support country operations. This increased the average number of deployment
days per staff by nearly 30 per cent. From a thematic standpoint, 37 per cent of the deployments were
related to both internal and inter-agency coordination processes, while technical surge support
represented 34 per cent of deployments. Additionally, IOM organized 42 surge deployments to
16 country operations where support was provided to address gender-based violence in crisis
response. Rapid response officers were deployed within days for 93 per cent of the 14 new crises to
which IOM responded in support of the first phase of response.

200.      During the reporting period, the Organization received 125 requests for deployments from
its roster of experts, 85 of which it was able to facilitate, representing a fill rate of 65 per cent.
Deployments were made to 17 IOM country offices around the world.

201.     IOM’s standby partners continued to be a key component of its surge response and provided
90 deployments, the equivalent of 8,821 staff days, to 21 country offices. These deployments were
made most frequently in the areas of information management (17%), data analysis (10%), shelter
(10%) and CCCM (10%).

Migrants in countries in crisis

202.      Based on its commitment to implement the recommendations in the Guidelines to Protect
Migrants in Countries Experiencing Conflict or Natural Disaster (MICIC Guidelines), IOM continued to
support governments and other local partners with preparedness activities aimed to reduce migrants’
specific vulnerability in crisis contexts. IOM offices in all regions implemented training programmes to
include migrants in emergency management in their host countries and to strengthen consular crisis
assistance for nationals abroad. IOM engagement also included dedicated programming to integrate
migrant-inclusive approaches into response operations following Hurricane Dorian in the Bahamas.

203.      Further support was given to operations through the development of guidance materials,
translating the 15 thematic areas of the MICIC Guidelines into actionable recommendations for
practitioners and policymakers, as well as training packages, including e-learning courses, and research
papers.

Transition and recovery

204.     The Organization’s transition and recovery programming supports governments,
communities, displaced persons and other affected populations in overcoming acute crisis and fragile
contexts and in laying the foundations for longer-term recovery and development. It also provides
important contributions to the humanitarian, development and peace nexus.

205.       In 2019, IOM continued to assist displaced persons and affected communities in mitigating
the detrimental impacts of displacement and moving towards durable solutions in line with its
Progressive Resolution of Displacement Situations Framework. Among other activities, the
Organization supported around 420,000 displaced persons to locally integrate, 273,000 persons to
reintegrate into their places of origin, and nearly 70,000 to relocate/resettle elsewhere. Overall,
activities in this regard reached over 1,100 communities.

206.       Access to sustainable employment and livelihoods is also a central component of IOM’s
transition and recovery work, which seeks to integrate individual support with community- and local-
level initiatives to build capacity and address barriers. In 2019, the Organization supported nearly
628,000 beneficiaries with a wide range of livelihood assistance and economic revitalization
programming. For example, it provided financial support to vulnerable IDPs in the Democratic Republic
of the Congo, cooking stoves, livestock and livelihood materials to 373 households in Myanmar, and
self-employment, microenterprise and scale-up grants for economic revitalization in Ukraine. In
Mozambique, IOM combined the provision of agricultural kits, livestock and training in food processing
to Mozambican returnees from Malawi to improve living conditions for vulnerable households.

207.      The Organization’s community stabilization work continued to play a key role in addressing
the drivers of displacement and creating conditions conducive to durable solutions. It also promoted
community–government engagement and fostered socioeconomic stability. In Egypt, for example,
IOM provided social assistance to displaced persons and host communities to improve their living
conditions, increase social cohesion and resilience, and ultimately prevent irregular and unsafe
migration, in line with the Regional Refugee and Resilience Plan (3RP).

208.      IOM’s peacebuilding portfolio is designed to prevent and resolve conflict, a principal driver
of displacement, and to support sustainable peace and reintegration. In Iraq, for instance, IOM
supported the creation of the flexible education model as part of the national policy on the social and
economic reintegration of ex-combatants of non-State armed groups. In the Democratic Republic of
the Congo, 577 police officers were trained in community policing in Lubumbashi, thereby improving
the local population’s perception of the police and increasing trust in State structures.

209.      In line with its global commitment to prevent, mitigate and respond to root causes and
drivers of displacement, the Organization continued its efforts to help prevent violent extremism. In
Kenya, for instance, it partnered with the National Counter Terrorism Centre, the Ministry of Interior
and county governments to assist returnees and youth at risk of radicalization.

210.     The Organization continued to implement and monitor progress on its Strategic Work Plan
on Disaster Risk Reduction and Resilience 2017–2020. In Myanmar, for example, IOM, in coordination
with the Ministry of Social Welfare, Relief and Resettlement, introduced township-level multi-hazard
risk maps, which were used to plan evacuations and future infrastructure development.

211.       Resolving housing, land and property issues is important to sustain reconciliation and peace
and to create durable solutions. In Colombia, for instance, IOM provided training for government
officials in the management of land tenure, use and appropriation rights and in the normative and
operational instruments required for the relevant administrative and judicial processes. In Iraq, IOM
established centres at six locations to provide legal advice on housing, land and property issues, such
as support for reclaiming property left behind during occupation by Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant.

212.      Reparations play a key role in advancing transitional justice and supporting broader
peacebuilding efforts. For instance, in Bosnia and Herzegovina, IOM conducted outreach activities to
raise the awareness of NGOs, CSOs and service providers on the rights of victims and the procedure to
apply for victim status, and also provided training for relevant government bodies on application,
assessment and decision procedures. In Colombia, under the framework of the Victims Institutional
Strengthening Programme, IOM provided technical assistance to local authorities for the
implementation of the public policy for victims of the armed conflict.

Resettlement and movement management

213.     Arranging the safe and dignified movement of refugees and migrants is a core function of the
Organization. The principal areas of programming in 2019 were resettlement, repatriation and
voluntary humanitarian return.

214.       The Organization supported over 30 States in conducting resettlement, humanitarian
admissions and relocation for 107,347 refugees and other vulnerable persons, with significant
operations out of Afghanistan, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iraq, Jordan, Kenya, Lebanon, Turkey, Uganda, Ukraine
and the United Republic of Tanzania. The top three resettlement countries were the United States of
America, Canada and Australia. Of the above-mentioned total, more than 1,000 persons in need of
international protection were relocated in European countries, with the majority departing from Malta
or Italy and smaller operations out of Greece and France. Moreover, 57 charter flights were arranged
for 8,576 of the above-mentioned total for refugees and other humanitarian entrants to final
destinations in Canada, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom.

215.     IOM facilitated the repatriation of 21,854 refugees to their country of origin, with Burundi
and Myanmar being the top two destinations. Of those individuals, 98 per cent travelled by land from
the United Republic of Tanzania and Thailand, while 2 per cent travelled by air from South Africa,
Angola and the United Republic of Tanzania.

216.      The Organization assisted 13,186 persons in situations of vulnerability via international air
travel (79% men, 21% women). Humanitarian charters were arranged primarily for migrants in Libya
voluntarily returning to their country of origin (e.g. Nigeria, Niger, Mali, Sudan) as well as for migrants
in Yemen voluntarily returning to Ethiopia. Additionally, IOM moved 199 migrants in Brazil for domestic
relocation by charter and assisted the voluntary return of 636 migrants to Cameroon, China, Mali, the
Niger and the Sudan. Moreover, 317 stranded migrants in dire need of help received humanitarian
assistance and travelled to safety under IOM auspices.

217.     Thirty-one offices helped their host governments to establish or expand resettlement and
movement management programmes. In Luxemburg, for instance, IOM concluded an agreement with
the Government to facilitate the resettlement of 50 refugees from the Niger. In Cameroon, IOM
worked closely with the Government to unite stranded diasporas and migrants with their families back
home.

218.     During the reporting period, 13 governments improved resettlement programmes following
IOM-led training or policy guidance. In Brazil, as a result of the support provided by the Emerging
Resettlement Countries Joint Support Mechanism, the Government developed a public tender to
engage civil society organizations in community-led resettlement.


OBJECTIVE 3: SAFE, ORDERLY AND DIGNIFIED MIGRATION

Facilitating safe and regular migration and mobility

219.     IOM aims to enhance regular migration and cross-border mobility by supporting immigration
and visa processing tasks and providing public, international non-profit alternatives to outsourcing
migration management tasks to for-profit entities. In 2019, 77 offices promoted and facilitated such
regular migration channels. Support was given to 432,077 beneficiaries with temporary and long-term
-----------------------Page 41 End-----------------------

C/111/5
Page 34


migration visa applications and for 102,353 cases of visa processing assistance for family reunification.
Support for humanitarian visa applications was provided to 23,428 beneficiaries. Other forms of
assistance for interested Member States included verifying documents across a network of offices for
visa and immigration-related applications.


                            Number of beneficiaries receiving visa-related support4




220.      IOM’s work in facilitating safe and regular migration and visa processing also contributed to
various governments further strengthening their approaches to safe, orderly and regular migration
management. In South America, IOM advocated for facilitated and accessible visa-based solutions and
supported the design and implementation of registration and provisional work permits for Venezuelan
migrants. The Organization provided advice for registration and regularization and a technical solution
to support biometric registration. It also designed a complementary training programme for large-scale
registration. The solution was first implemented in Trinidad and Tobago and then rolled out in Ecuador
to assist with the registration of up to 200,000 Venezuelan migrants.

221.      Offices around the world reported that their engagements in facilitating safe and regular
migration made a difference for migrants by contributing to more durable solutions. Gender
considerations are also regularly incorporated into IOM’s immigration and visa-related programming,
with 28 offices having reported specific activities. For example, the IOM Family Assistance Programme
provided tailored, gender-sensitive assistance and integration support for migrants – mainly women
and children in vulnerable situations – seeking to reunite with their families in Germany.

222.     In relation to addressing the specific vulnerabilities of migrants, in 2019 all locations where
IOM supported visa application procedures were equipped to accommodate beneficiaries with
reduced mobility. In the case of the Family Assistance Programme, centres are fully accessible for
beneficiaries with physical disabilities; day-care support in child-friendly facilities is also provided while
parents work on their applications.

4
    The number of beneficiaries refers to the number of times individuals were assisted through specific means and not the
    number of individuals assisted. For example, if someone receives assistance online, over the phone and at an IOM facility,
    that person is counted three times.
-----------------------Page 42 End-----------------------

                                                                                                   C/111/5
                                                                                                   Page 35


223.      Thirty-four offices reported additional activities that helped to address specific vulnerabilities
of applicants. For example, in South America, one of the key challenges for Venezuelan migrants was
identity management of minors owing to the lack of accepted photo identity documents for children.
IOM assisted the governments in the region to address such issues by sharing recommendations and
good practices aimed at ensuring effective registration and regularization.

Border and identity management

224.      Efficient and rights-based border and immigration management policies and structures,
supported by professional and well-trained personnel, facilitate and foster enhanced movement
management, development and trade at borders. They also contribute to preventing exploitative and
irregular migration, dismantling organized criminal networks and effectively protecting the rights of
migrants.

225.      In 2019, 100 IOM offices worked on border management, with engagements ranging from
enhancing border security and training on travel document inspection to cross-border and inter-
agency cooperation and information-sharing. Examples included building capacities of border agencies
in Armenia in line with international standards; supporting the Republic of Moldova with the
conceptualization and implementation of an advance passenger information system; awareness-
raising on social cohesion among border communities in Côte d’Ivoire; support for the establishment
of a document examination laboratory at Jomo Kenyatta International Airport in Nairobi; support in
Afghanistan to streamline identity verification; and the organization of a film festival in Baghdad
presenting 15 short films on the positive impact of community policing.

226.      Seventy-four offices included training for border and other relevant immigration officials and
partners in their activities. Worldwide training for over 18,000 border and other immigration officials
was provided directly or facilitated by IOM. This included 3,527 counterparts trained on border
management in crises, 2,373 on border security and 1,985 on travel document inspection, including
fraud detection. For instance, the African Capacity Building Centre delivered training of trainer sessions
on humanitarian border management to strengthen the protection of migrants between the Horn of
Africa and Yemen. Further examples included training on MIDAS (Migration Information and Data
Analysis System) – notably user and installation training in Djibouti, Haiti, Madagascar, the Marshall
Islands and other States. In Nigeria, IOM supported the authorities to successfully implement MIDAS
at the airports in Abuja, Kano and Lagos. Training of trainer sessions were also delivered in Bhutan for
the Department of Immigration, with a focus on passport examination.

227.      IOM initiatives on border and identity management resulted in positive long-term impacts
regarding the facilitation of safe, orderly and regular migration. In Azerbaijan, for instance, they led to
improvements in border security. In Burkina Faso and the Niger, they contributed to improving the
capacities of border agencies and strengthened collaboration and cooperation between border
communities and the relevant State authorities. Furthermore, in Egypt, IOM’s efforts led to
government and border authorities being better informed on strategic concepts and technical
solutions to tackle transnational crime effectively and to better address vulnerabilities of migrants
during search and rescue operations at sea and in the desert.

228.      Fifty-six offices addressed specific vulnerabilities of migrants through their border
management engagements, and fifty-four offices reported that gender considerations were part of
their border and identity management support activities. In the Lao People’s Democratic Republic, for
instance, IOM assisted border control officials to develop and adopt a gender-sensitive approach to
border management.

Health assessments and travel health assistance

229.       Through its pre-migration health activities, IOM ensures that individuals travelling under its
auspices are fit to travel and receive necessary travel health assistance. Migration health assessments
have many benefits, including the early detection and treatment of conditions of individual and public
health concern, safer travel and continuity of care. As part of the Organization’s pre-migration health
activities, nearly 100 offices provided or assisted the provision of 426,988 migration health
assessments for refugees and migrants. Over 140,000 individuals were vaccinated against more than
15 vaccine-preventable diseases as part of their migration health assessment; in total, over
440,000 doses of vaccine were provided. Individuals travelling under the auspices of the Organization
also received a pre-embarkation check by IOM clinicians. Moreover, 1,520 individuals requiring
assistance during travel owing to a medical condition travelled with a medical escort.



                      Pre-migration health activities for migrants and refugees




230.      In addition to the activities undertaken within IOM’s global health assessment programmes,
71 offices provided pre-embarkation checks for 144,811 beneficiaries of other IOM programme areas,
such as assisted voluntary return and reintegration and counter-trafficking. Furthermore,
24,000 migrants who required assistance during travel owing to a medical condition returned to their
country of origin with a medical escort.

231.     The Organization also provides post-arrival health assistance to migrants and refuges. In
2019, such assistance was provided to over 51,000 returnees in 53 countries.

Assisted voluntary return

232.     Assisted voluntary return remained a high priority for programmatic activities, with
63,634 migrants (25% female and 75% male, of which 17% were children) being assisted to return from
136 host countries (of destination or transit) to 163 countries of origin. The majority were assisted to
return from the Niger (21%), Germany (17%) and Djibouti (5%) to Ethiopia (8%), Mali (7%) and
-----------------------Page 44 End-----------------------

                                                                                                  C/111/5
                                                                                                  Page 37


Guinea (6%). For the first time, the majority of voluntary returns carried out by IOM did not originate
from the European Economic Area and Switzerland combined (36% in 2019 compared with 53% in
2018). West and Central Africa remained the main region of origin. Migrants in situations of
vulnerability continued to represent a significant portion of the total caseload of migrants assisted to
return in 2019.

233.    To promote safe and dignified return for assisted migrants, 39 offices engaged in
pre-departure activities through the provision of support in areas such as childcare, medical and
psychosocial assistance, financial services, housing and job placement.

234.      Guided by the principle of partnership in assisted voluntary return and reintegration
programming, 59 offices facilitated dialogue and capacity-building on return management at local,
regional and international level towards the establishment of referral mechanisms, the adoption of
guidelines, or for the establishment of interministerial committees and legislative reviews. For
example, in Germany, IOM implemented a series of events at regional level to inform migrants about
the country’s assisted voluntary return and reintegration programmes and initiatives.


ORGANIZATIONAL EFFECTIVENESS: 2019 KEY HIGHLIGHTS

235.       Around the world, IOM continued to have a profound impact on the beneficiaries it assists,
and on wider societies, whose resilience it seeks to strengthen. To continuously improve itself, the
Organization needs to demonstrate high levels of internal performance and gains in internal
efficiencies that will be sustained for years to come. For this purpose, an organizational effectiveness
results framework was developed with key targets on internal performance and efficiencies. The core
elements of the results framework are based on IOM’s ambition to be principled, purposeful and
prepared. This section reports on the key organizational highlights of the year.

IOM is principled

Gender Equality Policy 2015–2019

236.      The Organization made progress in terms of gender equality. It continued to implement the
IOM Gender Equality Policy 2015–2019, which will continue to be in effect until the adoption of a new
policy. By the end of the year, more than two thirds of current milestones in the Gender Equality Policy
2015–2019 implementation plan had been met. Notable achievements in 2019 included the
completion of face-to-face training on the IOM gender marker, with training courses having now been
delivered in all nine IOM regional offices and at Headquarters since 2017; and IOM meeting or
exceeding 8 of the 17 performance indicators of the United Nations System-wide Action Plan on
Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women.

237.       IOM saw further progress on its gender marker since it was adopted in late 2018. By the end
of the year, the total number of project proposals that had the objective of addressing a gender issue
rose to 50, which is 6 per cent of all applicable projects. Moreover, the total budget of all projects that
either directly targeted a gender issue or incorporated gender considerations in needs, outputs and
activities was an estimated USD 312,347,199, representing 53 per cent of the budget for all applicable
projects activated in 2019.

238.      During the year, a total of 962 staff members or other personnel completed the I Know
Gender training course, thus making a total of 11,363 since 2014. Two awareness-raising packages on
PSEA were also developed, one for IOM personnel and one for implementing partners. These were
sent to all regional and country offices.
-----------------------Page 45 End-----------------------

C/111/5
Page 38


239.      By the end of 2019, gender focal points had been named in all nine regional offices (eight
women, one man) and in 81 per cent of country offices, a slight decrease from 85 per cent in 2018. Of
these, 82 per cent were women and 18 per cent were men. An online networking platform was created
to stimulate further the promotion of gender equality in all external activities and internal processes.
Twelve gender focal points and other relevant personnel also participated in a week-long training
course on gender issues delivered by the International Training Centre of the ILO and UN-Women.

240.      At the end of 2019, women represented 47 per cent of all international Professional staff
(a slight decrease from 48% in 2018) and 47 per cent of all national staff (unchanged from 2018).
Women’s representation at the P-5 and above levels stood at 38 per cent, a slight increase compared
with 2018, with women holding 41 per cent of positions at the P-5 level, 36 per cent at the D-1 level,
and 31 per cent at the D-2 level. Women’s representation at the P-4 and above levels remained at
40 per cent, still short of the target of 45 per cent by 2023, as set out in the Diversity and Inclusion
Workplan. IOM will continue to closely monitor, analyse and report these statistics, moving towards
the goal of gender parity at all levels of the Organization (see Annex I for further details).

                        Snapshot of gender balance within the Organization




Disability inclusion

241.     With the launch of UNDIS in 2019, disability inclusion has become a priority for the
United Nations. IOM supported the drafting and launch of UNDIS and will comply with the mandatory
reporting requirement on disability inclusion at the operational and programmatic level, starting
in 2020.

242.      In 2019, IOM launched a campaign to showcase the experiences of IOM staff with disabilities
through storytelling and video testimonials. This resulted in a collection of 18 videos, including
two testimonials that are currently being used in training courses and awareness-raising activities. The
call for staff with disabilities to share testimonials resulted in several staff from different regions
coming forward with questions related to disabilities or reasonable accommodation, which they had
not disclosed in the past. It should be noted that the 2019 global survey on staff engagement included
questions on disability, and that 1 per cent of respondents (63) mentioned having a disability, while
1.6 per cent of respondents chose the response “Prefer not to say”. This was the first time that the
Organization collected quantifiable data on the number of staff with disabilities and the data are
currently being analysed.
-----------------------Page 46 End-----------------------

                                                                                                 C/111/5
                                                                                                 Page 39


243.      On the occasion of the International Day of People with Disabilities, the Director General and
the Deputy Chief of Staff highlighted the need to step up IOM’s commitment on the inclusion of
persons with disabilities, both internally and within communities on the move. The campaign, which
included videos, stories and testimonials of persons with disabilities in 10 IOM offices, reached over
240,000 social media accounts. In addition, the Office of the Director General organized three forums
on the inclusion of persons with disabilities.

244.     Furthermore, IOM has embarked on its own journey to ensure that there is greater
awareness and engagement on this issue, both at Headquarters and in the field. In 2019, the
Introduction to Disability Inclusion training course, which focuses on humanitarian settings, was
delivered in-person and via webinar to 249 persons across 25 IOM offices. Additionally, the Working
with People with Disabilities training course was delivered to 300 persons working on resettlement
and movement operations projects across 23 offices. Lastly, 30 regional pre-departure orientation staff
were provided with basic training on disability inclusion.

245.       Given that in situations of forced displacement and humanitarian crisis, the percentage of
the population with a disability is generally higher than the estimated global average, IOM has an
important role to play in ensuring that its humanitarian responses are more inclusive of persons with
disabilities. IOM was involved as a key contributor in the drafting of the IASC Guidelines on Inclusion of
Persons with Disabilities in Humanitarian Action, which were launched in November 2019. The
Organization has publicly committed to implementing the Guidelines within its operations and is an
active member of the IASC Reference Group on Inclusion of Persons with Disabilities in Humanitarian
Action, the entity in charge of implementing the guidance. Ten humanitarian operations also received
technical advice on strengthening disability inclusion in their operations.

Standards of conduct

246.      All persons employed by or working for IOM must adhere to the IOM Standards of Conduct
and all instructions issued by the Organization. The Policy for a Respectful Working Environment
stipulates that all staff members have the right to a workplace free of harassment, which IOM has a
duty to provide. IOM also has a policy of zero tolerance for sexual exploitation and abuse.

247.      By the end of the year, approximately 13,500 IOM staff had completed the mandatory
e-learning course on ethics and conduct. The course, launched in 2017, includes topics such as
protection from and response to sexual exploitation and abuse, fraud and corruption. In addition,
2,193 staff in the field and 64 staff at Headquarters took the face-to-face training course entitled Let’s
Talk Ethics, and a new anti-harassment training course – Building a Respectful Workplace: A Manager’s
Toolkit for Identifying, Preventing and Informally Addressing Harassment – was finalized and rolled
out. The latter was taken by 225 Chiefs of Mission, Resource Management Officers and Project
Managers to ensure that IOM’s senior staff lead by example in terms of standards of conduct.

248.      IOM continued to demonstrate its commitment to the highest standards of ethics and
conduct. Over the reporting period, 433 staff declared outside activities, 79 declared cases of potential
conflict of interest, and 68 reported cases of gifts or honours, thereby ensuring that the Organization
was better prepared to address potential conflicts of interest in a timely manner. In addition,
acknowledgment was sent and screening was initiated within 48 hours of a report being submitted for
86 per cent of allegations of retaliation.

249.     The new online reporting platform, entitled We Are All In, was also launched in 2019 to
streamline the reporting process, enabling users – be they IOM staff members, partners or
beneficiaries – to report all types of misconduct in two clicks. The platform also provides useful
-----------------------Page 47 End-----------------------

C/111/5
Page 40


information, tools and resources on the different types of misconduct, including sexual exploitation
and abuse, and details the post-reporting steps.

Transparency and accountability

250.      As a member of IATI since March 2017, IOM began publishing its organizational and activity
data in the IATI registry in February 2018, meeting its obligations as an IATI member. IOM continues
to publish the data quarterly, and, as of the fourth quarter of 2019, the number of projects published
rose to 1,173. At the end of the year, IOM’s score was 55 for both the IATI Dashboard and the
Humanitarian Dashboard. This represents a 60 per cent improvement from the first publication round
in 2018. The Organization also continued to roll out the internal IATI Transparency Portal at
Headquarters, the administrative centres and the regional offices in 2019, with the full roll-out to all
country offices planned for 2020.

251.       Efforts were ongoing to create synergies between reporting activities for internal and
external platforms and funds which have common reporting requirements (such as IATI, the 1 per cent
coordination levy and the Global Crisis Response Platform) to ensure that the collection and reporting
of master data are fit-for-purpose and uniform across all platforms. These system and data structure
adjustments will also facilitate greater alignment and integration with United Nations system-wide
financial reporting requirements and reforms.

Environmental sustainability

252.       In 2019, IOM continued to advance its work related to environmental sustainability both at
the institutional and country office levels with the objective of strengthening internal environmental
management capacity. The Organization’s first environmental policy – which seeks to align IOM’s
activities with global environmental standards – has been finalized and was being reviewed by the
Office of the Director General at the end of the reporting period.

253.      Environmental sustainability was also incorporated into key management frameworks, such
as the Internal Governance Framework. Along with other members of the United Nations system, IOM
was part of the task force that developed the Strategy for Sustainability Management in the
United Nations System 2020–2030 – Phase I: Environmental Sustainability in the Area of Management,
which was endorsed in May by the United Nations System Chief Executives Board for Coordination.
IOM continues to be part of the task force mandated to develop Phase II of the Strategy.

254.      IOM undertook its first-ever global environmental inventories in line with United Nations
standards, measuring the levels of greenhouse gas emissions, water usage and waste production for
individual IOM facilities and operations, with a response rate from offices of close to 80 per cent. These
annual environmental inventories will enable the Organization to establish its environmental
management system, track its environmental performance and identify and prioritize high impact
areas, including energy transition for facilities and operations. IOM’s global inventory results were
included in the United Nations system-wide Greening the Blue Report 2019, which was launched at
the 2019 Climate Action Summit.

255.      The Organization continued its active engagement with Member States, experts and
United Nations colleagues on topics related to environmental sustainability, including through the
Issue Management Group on Environmental Sustainability Management and the United Nations
Greening the Blue initiative under the United Nations Environment Management Group, the Global
Plan of Action for Sustainable Energy Solutions in Situations of Displacement and the Coordination of
Assessments for Environment in Humanitarian Action – an initiative based in the Joint UNEP/OCHA
Environment Unit.

Data protection

256.     Data protection continued to be a key priority in 2019, ensuring that the Organization is
equipped to act in an increasingly information-led programmatic environment, in line with the IOM
Data Protection Principles. To this end, 333 staff received face-to-face training on data protection and,
on the occasion of Data Protection Day, 260 staff members attended a series of one-hour data
protection webinars, information was distributed on the protection of personal data and quizzes on
relevant issues were conducted. In March, IOM, together with UNICEF and other partners, co-
organized an expert workshop in Morocco entitled Children on the Move: Building Migration Data
Capacities, at which IOM made a presentation on the topic of data for governance. IOM also spoke at
two other important meetings on the topic of data protection: the Spring Conference of European Data
Protection Authorities 2019 (Tbilisi, Georgia, 9 and 10 May 2019) and a workshop on the governance
of data and artificial intelligence, co-hosted by United Nations Global Pulse and the Office of the
United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (Geneva, 13–15 November 2019).

IOM is purposeful

Results-based management

257.      During the year, IOM continued to streamline results-based management at the institutional
level, with the aim of presenting its achievements at the country, regional and global levels using an
institution-wide reporting methodology, with the online institutional questionnaire serving as the
central reporting system. The participation rate for this tool reached 100 per cent in 2019 and the data
were used for the preparation of the present report. Further improvements are nevertheless needed
to improve the quality of reporting and to embed the systematic use of results and evidence in
decision-making processes, thereby ensuring a full transition to results-based management.

258.      Work on the development of new country and regional strategies significantly accelerated,
with the development of strategy development guidelines and online support for colleagues in the
creation of results-oriented strategies. Ninety-three offices revised existing or created new strategies.

259.      Communication and training remained a key priority. To increase staff understanding of
results-based management and help them to recognize its applicability in their daily work, a global
training course on strategic thinking and management was developed in collaboration with Harvard
Business Publishing. The course is intended to help participants deepen their understanding of how to
develop strategies that will achieve agreed visions and help them to become strategic leaders. The
results have been positive, and the Organization will continue rolling out the course globally to reach
as many mangers as possible.

External communications

•        Campaigns, branding and visibility

260.     Throughout the reporting period, IOM maintained high visibility to ensure that it speaks to
and represents all migrants around the world. The Organization continued to align its message with
the 2020 communications priorities of the United Nations, focusing on social cohesion, the plight of
IDPs, the migration and climate change nexus and the migration-related SDGs. Efforts were made
throughout the year to present appropriate, IOM-generated data and policy initiatives in public-facing
content.

261.      The Global Migration Film Festival had another successful year in 2019, helping to promote
a positive discourse on migration. The Festival is part of an IOM project – Through the Migration Lens
-----------------------Page 49 End-----------------------

C/111/5
Page 42


– Refocusing the Conversation – that works in the cultural and media space to facilitate better
reporting and representations of migration and migrants in the media.

262.      The Organization also organized and delivered several high-visibility and far-reaching events,
influencing opinion and creating awareness of IOM’s message and its mandate. The virtual reality
exhibit – Holding On – was presented eight times in five countries, including at the 2019 World
Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, at the Design for Humanity Summit, held in New York, and
during Refugee Week, in London.

263.      IOM also continued to update and fine-tune its branding by ensuring materials produced at
Headquarters and in the field comply with the IOM Brand Guidelines and the IOM House Style Manual
and incorporate the relevant Decade of Action/SDG brandings. These efforts were further expanded
in 2019 to include global social media accounts and other public-facing materials.

•         Community engagement

264.      In 2019, IOM harnessed the power of storytelling to share messages, including through its
year-long peer-to-peer campaign known as Migrants as Messengers. Through this campaign,
individuals were invited to tell their own stories and experiences about attempting to migrate.
Thirty per cent of the migrants trained to shoot videos were women, and a total of 560 videos were
filmed by migrants interviewing returning migrants in Guinea, Nigeria and Senegal about their
migration journeys. The resulting video clips were viewed on the campaign Facebook page – which has
approximately 41,000 followers – more than 1.6 million times. A rigorous impact evaluation concluded
that potential migrants exposed to the campaign were 19 per cent better informed about the risks and
opportunities associated with migration, 25 per cent more aware of the multiple risks associated with
irregular migration, and 20 per cent less likely to report intentions to migrate irregularly within the
next two years.

265.      During the reporting period, 142 offices monitored and analysed local media (newspapers,
radio, television, online media), and 54 offices provided training to local media. In Colombia, in
partnership with the Semana local magazine, IOM carried out workshops with journalists on
preventing the spread of xenophobic messaging, covering topics such as the provision of information
on the migration situation using official sources of data, key concepts for covering migration, and
covering migration issues on social media and media outlets.

266.      More than 600 journalists benefited from media training workshops in West Africa alone. In
El Salvador, IOM held workshops for journalists and students on issues including migration and gender;
the use of language, with a focus on human rights; data journalism; and return and reintegration in
migration contexts. In Eswatini, the training courses focused on how to cover the SDGs in the context
of migration. In Ethiopia, journalists and staff from the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs were
trained on issues related to migration, social affairs and employment. Additionally, a documentary was
broadcast on television on the prevention of irregular migration and the reintegration of returnees.

•         Media engagement

267.      The Organization’s designated spokespersons at Headquarters conducted in over 150 direct
media engagements with Geneva-based international correspondents and IOM provided direct
briefings to correspondents on 60 occasions at the twice-weekly media briefings for United Nations
organizations in Geneva.

268.    During the reporting period, learning and guidance tools were disseminated to more than
200 media focal points monthly, and media risk management was improved through the coordination
-----------------------Page 50 End-----------------------

                                                                                              C/111/5
                                                                                              Page 43


of lines to take across the Organization when dealing with the media. This included the creation of a
storage depository, from which colleagues can access and update information on key issues, including
Level 3 emergencies.

269.      A number of staff also received training on media and communications to increase the
Organization’s professional capacity in that area, including more than two dozen new Chiefs of
Mission. Information sessions on proactive communications were also held for staff members located
across South America and East Africa. IOM also delivered around 20 storytelling webinars to its media
focal points around the world and disseminated individual guidance on reporting, writing and the
presenting of IOM press notes, all to help the Organization to better articulate the work it does on
behalf of migrants.

•        Social media

270.      Greater engagement with the wider public has been an important part of IOM’s
communications strategy. During the reporting period, approximately 107 million people viewed the
Organization’s social media content, 2.6 million of whom actively engaged with online content (in the
form of commenting, sharing, or watching a video). By the end of the year, the IOM NewsDesk, an
email bulletin issued five times a week containing a blend of migration-related world news and
IOM-generated feature stories and press releases of international interest, had a subscription base of
more than 23,000 individuals. In addition, 55 special editions of the IOM NewsDesk were published,
21 of which were linked to the United Nations calendar of international days and 34 of which were
related to migration-related thematic issues, funding appeals and breaking news stories.

Monitoring and evaluation

271.     A strong monitoring and evaluation culture within the Organization also requires
commitment to capacity-building in that area, to maintain accountability and to streamline reporting
to donors. In the second year of the Organization’s strategy to manage its evaluation and monitoring
functions, the IOM Evaluation Repository was launched in order to make all evaluations accessible to
staff.

272.      IOM continued to successfully roll out the monitoring and evaluation e-learning course,
which comprises six comprehensive modules covering both foundational concepts and hands-on
guidance for field staff on monitoring and evaluation functions. By the end of the year, 184 staff from
83 separate IOM offices had taken the e-learning course. A post-training evaluation – usually
conducted 3 to 6 months after the end of the training course – was undertaken, with 107 out of
184 participants having responded (58% response rate). Of the 107 respondents, 23 per cent reported
a “very strong degree” of application of the learning objectives in their work, 47 per cent reported a
“strong degree of application” and only 6 per cent reported “little to no application”.

273.      Besides the efforts focused on building the capacity of staff, the Office of the Inspector
General, together with Regional Monitoring and Evaluation Officers, develops essential institutional
and corporate guidance to support offices worldwide in monitoring and evaluation and provides
technical guidance, as required. Its central monitoring and evaluation function responded to over
92 requests for monitoring and evaluation support during the reporting period.

274.      Of the 93 offices that developed a country or regional strategy or were in the process of
developing one, 36 included mechanisms for monitoring or evaluating the success of the strategy.
Examples of good practices include the IOM Office in Colombia, which prepares progress reports
annually for the IOM Colombia Indicative Work Plan 2015–2019; and the IOM Office in Guinea, which
has developed a dashboard to periodically monitor planned activities.
-----------------------Page 51 End-----------------------

C/111/5
Page 44


275.      During the reporting period, 35 decentralized evaluations (20 internal and 15 external
evaluations) and 5 centralized evaluations were carried out. The findings were used to shape the work
of the Organization. In Afghanistan, for instance, the IOM Office shares the lessons learned both
internally with staff and externally with stakeholders. Additionally, the IOM Office in Bosnia and
Herzegovina was able to integrate more sustainable structures within the government municipalities
based on the evaluation findings.

276.       Monitoring information is also used by a large number of country offices to improve
programming or expand opportunities. The IOM Office in Viet Nam uses the information to develop
projects that better target vulnerable populations. For example, while monitoring a project that
provides shelter assistance to communities affected by Typhoon Damrey, staff realized that mobile
populations in those areas were particularly vulnerable to climate change and environmental
degradation. As a result, IOM worked with the Viet Nam Red Cross Society to develop a project to build
the resilience of such populations in those provinces.

277.     The IOM Development Fund embarked on a mixture of internal and external ex-post
evaluations of projects using a meta-evaluation approach and consolidating the findings to ensure that
best practices and lesson learned are shared throughout the Organization. In order to assess the
sustainability of the projects, the Fund reviewed a large sample of them to discover what happened to
Fund projects after completion. The results are being used to inform the approach to sustainability and
future project design.

278.     In 2019, the Fund also reviewed 21 completed projects related to migration, the environment
and climate change that were funded between 2013 and 2018 to identify best practices, challenges
and trends. The results of this review are available on the IOM Development Fund website.

IOM is prepared

279.      IOM takes proactive measures to ensure that it can fulfil its purpose and deliver on its
intended results, as reconfirmed in the IOM Strategic Vision and the reforms of the Internal
Governance Framework. These measures include sound financial and human resources management
policies and practices; appropriate risk management strategies; knowledge management and a
commitment to apply lessons learned to enhance organizational effectiveness; commitment to
expanding its financial resources, including through flexible funding arrangements; and expanding its
membership and partnerships.

280.       Over the last two decades, IOM has grown significantly in terms of budget, staffing and scope
of activity. Alongside other internal and external developments, this has resulted in a strain on the
Organization’s internal governance system, including the core structure which plays a critical role
within it. An internal governance system is required which enables the Organization to fulfil its
mandate and objectives, facilitates its ability to continue to be a reliable and effective partner to
Member States, donors and other United Nations agencies and to ensure that it can continue to
provide high-quality assistance to beneficiaries. To address this, the Organization developed the
Internal Governance Framework, which outlines the essential requirements for a modern and fit-for-
purpose internal governance system. During 2019, work was undertaken to apply the Framework to
several priority areas, and updates on the status of its application were presented to Member States
at the sessions of the Standing Committee on Programmes and Finance.

281.     The reform process aims to improve the quality of the Organization’s overall functioning. It
centres on the functional needs of the Organization, differentiating controls according to risk levels
and identifying where controls interrelate with and impact upon one another; and streamlining
processes to allow for more agile management. The application of the Framework will, therefore, allow
-----------------------Page 52 End-----------------------

                                                                                                C/111/5
                                                                                                Page 45


IOM to measure and achieve enhanced efficiency, effectiveness, agility, consistency, accountability
and transparency across the Organization.

Regional support towards optimal delivery of services

282.      2019 was an important year for the regional offices. Beyond their consolidated role in
overseeing, planning and coordinating IOM functions and supporting country offices during the full
project cycle within their respective regions, it was also the first year that regional offices supported
their country offices to set up national networks under the United Nations Network on Migration and
in their engagement with UNCTs. The aim of these mechanisms is to facilitate effective, timely and
coordinated United Nations system-wide support to Member States on migration policy, including on
the implementation of the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration.

283.      A crucial function of the regional offices is the provision of policy guidance and strategic
direction. Throughout the reporting period, the regional offices continued to provide support to the
country offices to facilitate meaningful contributions to United Nations frameworks and processes,
including the achievement of the SDGs, thereby enhancing IOM’s role in those processes and its ability
to bring migration issues into debates. For example, the Regional Office in Buenos Aires contributed
to the formulation of the 2020 Refugee and Migrant Response Plan for refugees and migrants from
the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela by providing guidance on inter-agency coordination and
humanitarian planning, which enabled IOM focal points at the country level to bring relevant issues to
the attention of other agencies more concisely and consistently.

284.      Meaningful and targeted interactions between governments and donors and country offices
are key for successful dialogue and negotiations. The regional offices regularly provided support to
country offices in this regard. The Regional Office in Dakar established the International Thematic
Group on Migration in West Africa to foster a better understanding of current and emerging issues on
migration and to enhance coordination and collaboration, including with representatives of the donor
community. The Regional Office in Brussels supported IOM offices worldwide on internal tracking of
and increasing the visibility of European Union-funded projects; analysis of European Union funding
trends; and European Union financial and contract compliance aspects and contract negotiations. The
Regional Office in Buenos Aires successfully led resource mobilization for regional projects under the
2019 Refugee and Migrant Response Plan for refugees and migrants from the Bolivarian Republic of
Venezuela, which allowed the expansion of operations across the region. Additionally, the Office
worked with and provided technical support on request to Member States in the region which are part
of the Quito Process.

285.       The regional offices collected and distilled information on migration flows and trends to
enhance the ability of IOM offices to liaise with national counterparts, United Nations agencies, donors
and the media on relevant matters. The Regional Office in Vienna contributed to inter-agency efforts
in this area through the joint release (by IOM, UNICEF and UNHCR) of factsheets on the movement of
refugee and migrant children to Europe and access to education for refugee and migrant children in
Europe. The Regional Office in Dakar regularly updated the Mobility Mapping in West and Central
Africa report and the Regional Office in Bangkok provided offices with support on key figures and
information on the migration and climate change nexus and offered guidance on partnership-building
with other agencies in the region.

286.     The regional offices provided support to country offices on project performance reviews and
evaluations, quality control of terms of reference, the selection of evaluators, the review of reports,
and the training of internal evaluators to strengthen monitoring and evaluation capacities in their
respective regions. The Regional Office in Buenos Aires also set up and moderated a regional
community of practice on monitoring and evaluation that provides updated resources and a
-----------------------Page 53 End-----------------------

C/111/5
Page 46


permanent channel for technical assistance and dissemination of guidance and tools. The Regional
Office in Cairo produced and disseminated documents and measurement tools related to monitoring
and evaluation and also provided offices with support on evaluation planning and implementation. To
strengthen the quality, validity and reliability of monitoring and evaluation data for decision-making,
the Regional Office in Pretoria conducted a pilot data verification and validation exercise for the largest
migration health programme in the region and produced a handbook on the application of ICT
solutions to improve the quality and timeliness of monitoring and evaluation data capture, synthesis
and dissemination.

287.     In terms of communications and awareness-raising, the regional offices provided tailored
support to offices on the management of communications with the media and the public, information-
sharing on subregional and national developments to maintain coherence across messaging, the
development of shared media lines and general communications, and the coordination of these lines
with Headquarters. For example, the Regional Office in Dakar maintained its own investigative
journalism platform for the region, providing regional journalists with the means to cover sensitive
topics.

288.      Training remained a key activity for all regional offices. The Regional Office in San José
provided training and guidance to countries on communication for development in Central America,
which led to the successful implementation of four pilot campaigns in the region. The Regional Office
in Nairobi trained 63 IOM staff and consultants in the region on PSEA and provided support to offices
on ensuring adherence to PSEA policies. Training and technical assistance activities by the Regional
Office in Buenos Aires resulted in increased knowledge and skills in monitoring and evaluation and
improved project development in the context of the implementation of PRIMA. Similarly, the Regional
Office in Cairo held training courses at country and regional level on topics such as project
development and implementation, PSEA, migration management in crises, transition and recovery and
the Mobile Asset Inventory Application, and the Regional Office in Dakar provided training for all Chiefs
of Mission from the region on the IOM Institutional Strategy on Migration and Sustainable
Development.

289.      The Regional Office in Bangkok trained staff from IOM offices in Myanmar and Papua New
Guinea on project development, monitoring and evaluation and reporting, while the Regional Office
in Vienna supported IOM offices in Albania, Uzbekistan and Kosovo5 on integrating migration-related
questions into statistical office censuses and also built the capacity of IOM offices in Armenia,
Azerbaijan and Georgia on using big data for diaspora mapping. The Regional Offices in Vienna and
Bangkok also carried out cross-regional training for staff on protection, and the Regional Office in
Pretoria conducted training on monitoring and evaluation in the context of assisted voluntary return
and reintegration for relevant government and civil society partners in Malawi.

Knowledge management

290.     As part of efforts to improve knowledge management, the Policy Hub was created in April
2019 to spearhead internal efforts to improve knowledge management practices related to migration
policy development. IOM captured and shared best practices and lessons learned through research
guidance notes, which were published on the IOM intranet and the Migration Data Portal and shared
via regular IOM newsletters. In addition, nine Migration Research @Lunchtime seminars with
presentations by external researchers were organized throughout the year at Headquarters – for which
the recordings are available on the intranet and the Internet – helping to create more space for
knowledge-sharing and collaboration in the area of migration. A lessons learned exercise was also
conducted following the production of the World Migration Report 2020.

291.       IOM regularly updated its Migration Health Research Portal with the latest reports, studies
and peer-reviewed articles to which IOM had contributed. The Organization issued 21 peer-reviewed
publications on migration and health in 2019, the majority of which were original empirical research
studies that contributed to advancing scientific knowledge and evidence to inform policy and practice.
To further ensure innovative means of knowledge dissemination, IOM launched an audio podcast on
migration and health, enabling leading figures in the scientific community to discuss their findings and
the policy and practice implications. In partnership with the largest global network of migration health
research scholars and practitioners, IOM also launched a global mapping project in the second quarter
of 2019 to map all research, technical training, and capacity-building programmes on migration health
globally. IOM is also supporting the development of a toolkit to map migration health-related policies
and data sources at the national and subregional levels in the Middle East and North Africa.

292.      IOM further supports evidence-informed policy and practice at global, regional and country
level by providing technical input and advice on the design and implementation of migration health
studies. In 2019, IOM supported research projects in countries in the Middle East and North Africa
(Egypt, Libya, Morocco, Tunisia, Turkey, Yemen); the Asia-Pacific region (Bangladesh, Cambodia, Fiji,
Malaysia, Nepal, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Timor-Leste, Vanuatu, Viet Nam); Africa
(Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ghana, Nigeria, Mozambique, South Africa, South Sudan, Uganda);
Europe and Central Asia (Belarus, Georgia, Netherlands, Tajikistan); and all countries in North America
and Latin America and the Caribbean.

Risk management

293.     Sound risk management is critical to the preparedness of the Organization to tackle and
respond to crises. The internal policy entitled Management of Risk in IOM aims to effectively identify,
assess and manage the uncertainties that the Organization faces in achieving its objectives. In 2019,
the Organization continued to roll out its risk management process and to integrate the process into
key decision-making and business processes. To ensure that IOM will be fit for the future, risk
management must be fully mainstreamed across all functions, operations, activities, procedures and
processes so that it can overcome any external or internal shocks while delivering its mandate, thus
ensuring business resilience and continuity.

294.       During the reporting period, 44 IOM offices conducted country-level risk assessments, with
31 of these having a risk focal point who followed up on the treatment of priority risks. A critical focus
was on the integration of risk management into the project development process. Significantly,
152 offices reporting on risk management analysed and recorded projected risks at the project
development stage, with 131 of these continuing to monitor risks during implementation.
Sixty-four offices integrated risk management into their daily activities. IOM also completed a high-
level risk categorization of all country offices, the results of which are being used to prioritize risk
management activity in 2020.

295.     An enhanced risk management information system is under development to strengthen the
risk management process by streamlining the input and analysis of risk information so that the
information can be used effectively and in a timely manner.

296.     In Indonesia, IOM participated in the United Nations inter-agency risk assessment. The data
are used as a baseline for UNDSS to develop the security risk management document, country
evacuation plan and other mandatory security documents. In Sierra Leone, IOM, along with other
United Nations agencies, participated in the national youth assessment exercise. The findings will guide
implementation of the United Nations Youth Strategy. In Sri Lanka, a security risk assessment was
conducted in response to changes in the security environment resulting from terrorist attacks in April
and to contribute to the United Nations country-specific security risk management process. The
-----------------------Page 55 End-----------------------

Page 48


Organization also participated in a system-wide security assessment, providing input resulting from an
internal review. In Uganda, standard operating procedures to guide responses to Ebola outbreaks were
developed in partnership with the Ministry of Health.

Financial highlights

297.     The combined total revenue of the Organization, comprising assessed contributions,
voluntary contributions and other income, increased by 17.4 per cent compared with 2018 and
reached USD 2.13 billion in 2019. The assessed contributions from Member States continued to
represent a small proportion of IOM’s funding structure, accounting for less than 3 per cent of
consolidated revenue for 2019.

298.     The annual financial results for 2019 showed a 16.9 per cent increase in the combined total
expenditure compared with 2018, with the total expenses reaching USD 2.1 billion, meeting the
Organization’s annual budget target.

299.     The Organization managed a total of 3,523 financially active projects during the year, of
which 2,863 remained active at 31 December 2019.

300.     IOM continued to encourage donors to make predictable multi-year unearmarked
contributions, which allow IOM to invest in strategic and institutional initiatives. During 2019,
11 donors (Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Ireland, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Sweden, Switzerland,
United Kingdom, United States) provided a combined total of USD 28.5 million in unearmarked flexible
funding to IOM. This funding was instrumental in implementing important reforms under the Internal
Governance Framework and initiatives outlined in the Strategic Vision.

301.     During the reporting period, IOM met its target on the implementation of the road map of
the new Data Standards for United Nations System-Wide Reporting of Financial Data and
operationalized the 1 per cent coordination levy. With reference to United Nations General Assembly
resolution 72/279 of 31 May 2018 and subsequent implementation guidelines for the 1 per cent
coordination levy, IOM collected more than USD 0.8 million in 2019. The funds were transferred by
IOM to the United Nations Special Purpose Trust Fund on behalf of the contributing donors.

302.     In line with its commitments under the Grand Bargain, IOM implemented a new approach
enabling the tracking of funding channelled to national partners and actors separately from funding
channelled to international partners. The audited data for 2019 showed that more than
USD 101 million was channelled through implementing partners for humanitarian activities, up from
USD 46.4 million in 2018. This represents 9.3 per cent of total spending on humanitarian activities in
2019, up from 5.6 per cent in 2018. In addition, 35 per cent of the funding channelled through
implementing partners was awarded to local and national responders (i.e. national/local CSOs and
governmental entities). This represents 3.3 per cent of the total spending on humanitarian activities,
up from 2.6 per cent in 2018. All other humanitarian activities were directly implemented by IOM
through its field offices.

303.     Expenditure through implementing partners across all IOM activities increased to
USD 159.2 million in 2019 (2018: USD 97.2 million), which is 7.6 per cent of total combined
expenditure for 2019. The total expenditure awarded to local and national responders increased to
USD 77.3 million, an increase of 36 per cent compared with 2018 (USD 56.8 million).

304.      IOM continued to implement new technological solutions to modernize its financial
controlling and compliance tools and systems in tandem with other ongoing initiatives and reforms.
The Organization implemented the first pilot of the innovative online Financial Coordination Platform,
-----------------------Page 56 End-----------------------

                                                                                                   C/111/5
                                                                                                   Page 49


which enhances, synergizes and automates coordination, escalation, case management and
knowledge-sharing on financial matters between all IOM offices worldwide. Using the new platform,
more than 12,000 requests were sent to central financial units during 2019. In addition, IOM began
using a continued compliance monitoring tool that is directly integrated into PRISM, which is moving
the Organization from reactive and largely manual financial controlling solutions to system-integrated,
preventive and more efficient monitoring practices.

Resource mobilization

305.      To be better prepared for the future, 42 IOM offices have developed resource mobilization
strategies. Various resource mobilization tools – such as donor profiles, the Devex funding tracking
platform and the SharePoint site – are in use.

306.      In November, IOM organized a donor visit to Nigeria, with 25 participants from 12 different
donor entities from Geneva and capitals. The purpose of this visit was to showcase IOM’s operational
capacity in the field, the breadth of its humanitarian, transitional and development programming, how
the Organization collaborates with the Government, United Nations agencies and other partners on
the ground, and to highlight the significant needs and challenges in Nigeria and other countries. It was
also an opportunity to exchange information and develop a better understanding of donor priorities
and expectations. Three donor alerts were also issued to further adapt to changing donor
environments.

307.      The Organization received USD 3.9 million in private sector contributions in 2019
(2018: USD 5.7 million). Substantial milestones were achieved through the Private Sector Partnership
Strategy 2016–2020, particularly in terms of increases in other income related to IOM’s ongoing
cooperation with private sector partners. Twenty-eight offices reported receiving innovative types of
funding in 2019, including in the form of Junior Professional Officers, secondments and United Nations
volunteers.

Procurement and supply chain effectiveness

308.       Strengthening the Organization’s procurement and supply chain is a key institutional priority
and is embedded in the Internal Governance Framework reform process. To this end, many new
initiatives were started in 2019 to make procurement more streamlined and operational, boosting
both efficiency and value for money, while maintaining high levels of accountability.

309.        For example, IOM engaged the Fritz Institute to conduct an independent review of the
existing procurement and supply chain practices to identify potential areas for new smart controls for
improved transparency and accountability. By the end of 2019, the Fritz Institute had completed the
first of five planned field trips, together with an initial series of stakeholder interviews at Headquarters
and a benchmarking exercise with the World Food Programme, UNICEF and UNHCR.

310.     Procurement and supply chain digitization and automation solutions were also fully
integrated into planning for new IT solutions to enable the transformation of key business processes
under the auspices of the Internal Governance Framework. In preparation for the transition to
redesigned processes and systems, an online purchase requisition form and a digital workflow were
developed to further simplify and streamline procurement processes, with implementation of the
online purchase requisition form planned for mid-2020.

311.     IOM also started the institutional review of its vendor management system, with the aim of
introducing defined vendor categories to allow for a more consistent application of management
guidelines and procedures, including the clean-up of the vendor master database. This intervention is
-----------------------Page 57 End-----------------------

C/111/5
Page 50


critical to both inform the development of the third-party accountability framework and to
operationalize that framework at a later stage. IOM also began the process of reviewing all third-party
accountability and grievance and misconduct management policy guidelines to evaluate the extent to
which the policy infrastructure in place is harmonized with the United Nations Supplier Code of
Conduct and the application of the Model Policy Framework on Vendor Sanctions for the
United Nations System.

312.      In the ongoing effort to improve supply chain effectiveness and efficiency, IOM has
undertaken efforts to improve warehouse management. A warehouse database has been introduced
with more than 140 warehouses registered by 42 country offices, representing a combined warehouse
space of 146,370 m2.

313.      Long-term agreements remained a key intervention to ensure efficient and compliant
procurement, contributing to value for money. Seventy-seven global long-term agreements were in
place by the end of the year, an increase of 13 per cent from the previous year (2018: 68).

Privileges and immunities

314.      Privileges and immunities ensure that the Organization and its staff have operational
independence. In 2019, IOM benefited from full privileges and immunities in 98 countries and partial
privileges and immunities in 59 countries. IOM had no privileges and immunities in 30 countries. Efforts
were continued to negotiate better privileges and immunities for the Organization worldwide in
accordance with Council Resolution No. 1266 of 26 November 2013 on improving the privileges and
immunities granted to the Organization by States.

Member States and observers

315.       In 2019, Uzbekistan joined the Organization, bringing total membership to 173 Member
States. In addition, by the end of 2019, there were a total of 163 IOM observers: eight observer States,
33 organs and organizations of the United Nations, 45 intergovernmental organizations and 77 other
organizations.

IOM Headquarters building

316.      At its 109th Session, the Council adopted Resolution No. 1373 of 27 November 2018 on a
plan for the Headquarters building. As envisaged, the Director General – as project owner – established
the Headquarters Building Steering Committee. The Steering Committee is the first oversight level for
project planning and review and is supported by functional experts within IOM.

317.      The Administration met with officials from the United Nations Office at Geneva and
four other organizations that were undertaking similar construction projects in 2019 to benefit from
their experience and lessons learned.

318.      The Administration engaged a consultancy firm as a project consultant (assistant maître
d’ouvrage) tasked with compiling the necessary documents to support the loan application for the first
phase of the project (architectural studies and the international architectural design competition). In
addition, broad consultations with staff are taking place to determine their needs and translate them
into project requirements by developing different occupancy models.

                                                                                                Page 51


Human resources

•        Human resources management

319.      At the end of 2019, the total number of staff was 14,811, representing an increase of 17 per
cent compared with the end of 2018. Of this total, 945 women and 1,061 men belonged to the
international Professional category, and 5,993 women and 6,812 men belonged to the General
Services category (see the annexes for further details). In the international Professional category,
577 staff operated in hardship locations (i.e. categories D and E), representing 29 per cent of the total
international Professional staff.

•        Staff capacity, skills and training

320.       IOM continued to promote an environment that enables the development of staff skills and
capacities and ensures sound performance management in line with the Organization’s strategic
priorities. Seventy-one per cent of respondents to the 2019 global staff survey agreed that IOM
provides a workplace free of discrimination, an increase of 13 per cent compared with 2016 figures. In
addition, 52 per cent of respondents felt that IOM provides good opportunities for career progression
for its staff.

321.       A total of 8,437 staff (approximately 57%) undertook at least one training course in 2019, of
which 52 per cent were women and 48 per cent were men. With regard to their location, 97 per cent
of staff trained were based in the field, with the remaining 3 per cent at Headquarters, which closely
matches the geographical distribution of staff members worldwide.

322.      In total, 341 thematic and cross-cutting training sessions (including online sessions) were
recorded in I-Learn, IOM’s learning management system, 309 of which were delivered in person. A
further 164 webinars were conducted in 2019, reaching 2,168 attendees. IOM also organized
three interactive sessions for Headquarters and the two administrative centres to inform staff about
the range of opportunities available for ongoing learning and professional development.

323.     In 2019, 352 staff members received training on project development and 148 received
project management training. Two training courses for Chiefs of Mission and Heads of Office were also
held at Headquarters in February and November, which were attended by 36 staff in total. The course
focused on building leadership capabilities and enhancing negotiation and influencing skills.

324.      In a cross-divisional initiative, a combined workshop on MIGOF, the SDGs and the Global
Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration was held, bringing together staff from all nine
regions.  The workshop provided participants with the knowledge and skills to understand and
articulate the linkages between MiGOF, the SDGs and the Global Compact, to frame IOM’s work in the
context of these global frameworks, and to use the frameworks flexibly in their daily work. It enabled
colleagues in the field to better respond to IOM’s new responsibilities following the adoption of the
Global Compact, the establishment of the United Nations Network on Migration and the reform of the
United Nations development system.

325.       Various initiatives were undertaken to ensure that IOM maintains high standards in terms of
resource management. Training courses were conducted throughout the year for over 100 resource
management staff on the newly introduced 1 per cent coordination levy. A series of nine online
certification training modules on financial management rules and procedures were developed. The
first module – on cash and bank management – was successfully launched in 2019, for which 330 staff
members were successfully certified. Eighty-five staff members also received training on IATI, either in
person or online.
-----------------------Page 59 End-----------------------

326.      In December, the Senior Emergency Leadership and Coordination Training was launched,
with the aim of expanding the pool of qualified deployable senior emergency managers and improving
the Organization’s capacity in the areas of crisis preparedness and response. Eighteen qualified staff
members undertook 10 technical modules, 5 modules on soft skills and 6 simulated exercises which
reproduced an emergency manager’s response to an emerging humanitarian crisis. Aside from the
operational focus, institutional accountabilities such as AAP, gender-based violence and PSEA were
also included in the course to ensure that future emergency managers provide a principled and
effective response for affected populations.

327.      Other training courses included a workshop on immigration and visa trends and solutions,
23 courses in the field on counter-trafficking and assistance for vulnerable migrants, and online and
in-person courses on migration data taken by 259 staff members. To increase legal capacity within the
Organization, 195 staff received training on contract reviewing, and 75 staff were trained on legal
status, contracts and privileges and immunities.

•         Performance management

328.      Sound staff performance management is critical to overall IOM performance. When carried
out effectively, performance management sustains staff commitment and motivation. The Staff
Evaluation System had a 54 per cent compliance rate in the 2019 performance cycle. Compliance rates
in the regional offices were as follows: Vienna, 79 per cent; Buenos Aires, 67 per cent; Pretoria, 57 per
cent; Nairobi, 63 per cent; Bangkok, 48 per cent; Brussels, 38 per cent; Cairo, 55 per cent; Dakar, 51 per
cent; and San José, 42 per cent. The Manila and Panama Administrative Centres had compliance rates
of 52 and 32 per cent, respectively, while the compliance rate at Headquarters was 26 per cent. A new
and enhanced performance management system is under development, as part of the Internal
Governance Framework reform process.

•         Staff welfare

329.      The 2019 global staff survey had a response rate of over 50 per cent across the Organization
(compared with the 18% global response rate in 2016). The survey found that staff were committed to
the Organization’s values and work but also recorded high levels of stress-related factors faced by staff,
including stress in the workplace, lack of work–life balance, lack of flexible working arrangements, and
leadership not addressing non-performance. In order to support staff members’ mental health and
well-being, IOM continued to implement measures in line with the IOM Mental Health Strategy.
Four hundred and fifty-six staff received counselling, 47 training sessions were delivered, and 19 visits
to offices were made. Additionally, educational material was made available to staff on the IOM
intranet and an initiative to enhance well-being was piloted in seven offices.

•         Consistent conditions for staff

330.     Conditions of service should be consistent for all staff, with them receiving fair and equal
treatment, regardless of their location. IOM has been rolling out the Unified Staff Rules in all countries
of operation for staff in the General Service category, which includes National Officers. By the end of
2019, 76 per cent of General Service staff and National Officers were covered by the Unified Staff Rules.

331.     During 2019, the Global Staff Association Committee reached a number of milestones in
supporting staff. From 1 March onwards, legal assistance and insurance were made available to all of
the nearly 11,000 Global Staff Association members worldwide, including staff in the General Service
category for the first time. The Committee also provided individual support to 176 staff members and
-----------------------Page 60 End-----------------------

                                                                                                 C/111/5
                                                                                                 Page 53


collective assistance to 74 staff members during the reporting period. Furthermore, 14 National Staff
Association Committees were established, bring the number of such committees worldwide to
51. Training was provided to 36 Chairs and Vice-Chairs of National Staff Association Committees to
increase their capacity to provide the necessary support to National Staff Association members in their
respective offices.

332.     The Committee also drafted two background papers and concrete recommendations to
support IOM’s policy development process on performance management and unified parental leave
and established the Compassion Fund, to support spouses or partners of IOM employees, interns,
consultants and third-party contractors in exceptional financial circumstances in the event of the
employee’s death.

•        Diversity and inclusion and staff representation

333.      A workplace that promotes diversity and inclusion enables all staff to contribute to the
Organization and to serve beneficiaries and Member States effectively. IOM is committed to this
principle and has made several efforts to promote it across the Organization.

334.      The global staff survey demonstrated several positive trends in this regard. For example, the
proportion of engaged respondents – those who would recommend IOM as a good place to work – is
similar to the benchmark results of other organizations, as were the results regarding views on
leadership, a key factor affecting staff engagement, with 70 per cent of responses being positive.
Significant improvements were seen in the areas of diversity and respect at work, in comparison with
the 2016 staff survey. For example, 80 per cent of respondents felt that IOM has a work environment
that supports diversity, which is 18 per cent higher than the 2016 results, and 71 per cent of
respondents felt that the Organization provides a work environment free of discrimination, an
improvement of 13 per cent compared with 2016.

335.      During the reporting period, 166 nationalities were represented in the Organization’s global
workforce. This figure includes 136 nationalities represented at the international Professional level and
89 nationalities at the senior level (P-4 level and above). Progress continued to be made in geographical
diversity at the international level. IOM staff from countries in the global South (countries that are not
members of the OECD Development Assistance Committee) represented 79 per cent of the total IOM
workforce, an increase of 1 per cent compared with 2018. Furthermore, 74 per cent of Member States
were represented among international Professional staff, a slight increase from the previous year
(2018: 73%). The Organization constantly liaises with the permanent missions and governments of
non-represented Member States to ensure that their qualified professionals have the possibility to
apply to and be hired by IOM.

336.     One effort to promote diversity is the Diversity and Inclusion Internship Programme, through
which 18 individuals (14 female) from the global South were awarded internships in several offices
around the world. By the end of 2019, seven participants in this programme had been retained by the
Organization.

•        Workplace conflict prevention and resolution

337.      The Office of the Ombudsperson is responsible for addressing work-related issues in an
informal, independent, neutral and impartial, and confidential manner. The Organization understands
that only by developing a culture of addressing conflict in a timely manner can staff reach their full and
future potential. In 2019, the Office of the Ombudsperson continued to implement the integrated
conflict management system through its three-pronged approach: prevention, management and
resolution.
-----------------------Page 61 End-----------------------

C/111/5
Page 54


338.       In terms of prevention, the Office of the Ombudsperson strengthened its educational
programmes by providing over 30 online didactic materials and by organizing approximately
40 webinars and in-person training sessions. Over 5,700 individuals benefited from the Respectful
Workplace Classroom. Concerning conflict management, the Office expanded its network of respectful
workplace focal points to approximately 100 participants, expanding the network’s reach to
two thirds of IOM offices, enabling the provision of timely, in situ conflict prevention support. In
addition, a mediation training programme was piloted to allow 10 respectful workplace focal points
and staff from the Office of the Ombudsperson to provide prompt and local dispute resolution support.
In 2019, the Office received 384 staff seeking assistance (nearly 150% more than the number of visitors
received in 2018). Using a methodology obtained from a governmental counterpart, the Office can
conservatively estimate that its caseload represents USD 4.6 million in costs saved. Regarding conflict
resolution, the Office published one annual report and four periodic reports – identifying 28 systemic
issues and making recommendations to increase organizational effectiveness.

•         Staff security

339.     Staff security is of paramount importance, not only to foster a safe work environment, but
also to enable the Organization to effectively deliver its mandate around the world. During the
reporting period, implementation began of the Staff Security Strategic Plan: 2019 to 2021,
commencing with a realignment of IOM’s security functions in June 2019.

340.        As part of the Organization’s strategic and technical security risk management measures and
duty-of-care responsibilities, in 2019, IOM and UNDSS signed a framework of collaboration for the
integration of UNDSS Electronic Travel Advisory and SCAAN. SCAAN is a staff security system
comprising a digital platform for security professionals and a mobile application designed for all IOM
personnel, which enables users to notify IOM security personnel if they are in danger, to be notified of
potential threats and to submit security clearance requests. This IOM-pioneered technical innovation
is a first in UNSMS. The World Health Organization, the International Telecommunications Union and
the International Criminal Court have also piloted SCAAN and are in the process of acquiring full access
to the digital platform.

341.      Furthermore, the Organization continued to have a large worldwide presence to ensure the
best possible care and security for its staff, with a network of seven Regional Field Security Officers,
34 International Field Security Officers, and 88 National Security Officers and Local Security Assistants.
An additional Regional Field Security Officer post was added in 2019 in Pretoria to cover the Southern
African region.

342.      In 2019, IOM delivered 136 security training sessions globally, 122 of which were certified
United Nations security courses and 14 of which were IOM-developed specialized security training
courses. A total of 2,839 UNSMS and IOM personnel were trained, of whom 59 per cent were men,
and 41 per cent women. In addition, IOM deployed United Nations-certified IOM security trainers to
support UNDSS, the United Nations Staff Systems College and other agencies in delivering 23 security
training courses globally, with 508 UNSMS participants.

Information technology

343.      IOM leverages technology to deliver value for the Organization. In 2019, IOM focused the
delivery of its technology-driven initiatives under key activity pillars in order to bring about progressive
organizational improvements and to support the IOM Strategic Vision.
-----------------------Page 62 End-----------------------

                                                                                                 C/111/5
                                                                                                 Page 55


344.       The Organization works to ensure a secure ICT architecture where it operates. In 2019,
previous efforts in information security were expanded by enhancing monitoring capabilities through
the implementation of a new tool, Security Information and Event Management, that proactively
monitors, tracks down and helps to prevent security threats from turning into actual cyberattacks
against the Organization’s IT assets. In addition, recognizing that staff user accounts are the first line
of defence against cyberthreats, IOM also deployed a tool to enable staff to easily reset or recover
their passwords without having to rely on user support to assist them, thereby increasing the
availability of self-service solutions to users.

345.      IOM delivers flexible and scalable solution ecosystems that address the needs of migrants
and beneficiaries, as well as the internal administrative needs of the Organization. In 2019, IOM
worked to analyse and implement key enhancements to MiMOSA, to pave the way for a modernized
next generation version that will be able to respond to the evolving requirements of the operations it
supports. Work also continued to address operational needs in both emergency and non-emergency
settings through the development of mobile applications. To this end, a registration app was launched,
allowing beneficiaries to safely register for IOM services using mobile devices. Enhancements to
iGATOR, a tool that facilitates the movement of migrants, were also delivered in 2019.

346.       With the aim of modernizing key corporate applications, it was determined that, 10 years
since its original launch, PRISM was also due for a significant upgrade. In 2019, IOM undertook internal
consultations and assessments to gather feedback on needed enhancements and to produce a
business case for platform and technology upgrades for a next generation PRISM.

347.       The reporting period also saw the full and completed roll-out of PRIMA, which was piloted in
February and further deployed in subsequent phases, resulting in utilization across every IOM region
by November. Four hundred and seventy projects were active in PRIMA by the end of December,
representing 14.5 per cent of all IOM projects. In 2019, all IOM Development Fund projects were also
active in PRIMA. To maximize uptake and ensure a smooth transition that would lead to the realization
of early benefits, the Organization complemented the PRIMA global roll-out with  training for staff on
its use. Onsite training was conducted in all nine regional offices and at Headquarters, reaching over
1,000 staff members.  At the project level, PRIMA covers the full project life cycle and supports a
results-based approach to programming. It also incorporates features that facilitate the monitoring of
a project’s results, risks and activities, which then feed into donor reports generated from PRIMA.

348.       The Organization is committed to continuing the improvement and expanding seamless and
efficient delivery of core ICT services that harness innovation while enhancing user experience. In 2019,
IOM launched a cloud-based global support and services portal to cover the full spectrum of IT support,
from incident reports to requests for IT services. The new portal and its mobile application version
facilitate the process of logging a service request by staff, and enable them to consult the portal’s
knowledge base and monitor the status of open tickets and requests they have raised.
