A brief history

12

There are a number of ways of looking at the World
Trade Organization: as an organization for tradeopening, a forum for governments to negotiate
trade agreements, and a place for them to settle
trade disputes. It operates the global system of
trade rules and helps developing countries to build
their trade capacity. Essentially, the WTO is a place
where member governments try to sort out the
trade problems they face with each other.

Introduction

Message from

D i re c tor- G ene ral Rob e r to A z evêdo

As I write these words, international trade
faces unprecedented uncertainty amid the
coronavirus pandemic and its immense
economic fallout.

The global economy is in its worst
downturn since the 1930s. WTO
economists foresee a bumpy year
ahead. Their forecast for 2020
estimates that the volume of global
merchandise trade will tumble by
between 13 and 32 per cent compared
to the previous year. The depth of the
fall will depend on two main factors:
one, how long it takes to bring the
pandemic under control; and two,
the policies governments implement
– domestically and at the international
level – to mitigate its economic
consequences.

crisis. It is essential that governments
and international organizations work
together. The WTO is committed
to doing its part to foster such
cooperation. One key aspect of this is
transparency – we have stepped up
monitoring and information-sharing to
allow all participants in world trade to
keep track of COVID-related measures
governments have introduced to
facilitate or restrict trade. The WTO will
also serve as a forum for members to
share views and coordinate action on
trade policies as economies emerge
from the crisis.

This underscores why international
cooperation to keep global markets
open for goods and services is more
important than ever. As the world
fights the COVID-19 pandemic,
maintaining open supply lines will
facilitate access to medical products
and food. Restricting trade and
disrupting established supply chains
will make it harder to ramp up the
manufacture of much-needed protective
equipment, testing kits, ventilators and
other essentials. In the longer run, a
turn towards protectionism will slow
down the global economic recovery,
to the detriment of all countries, most
damagingly for the poorest.

Prior to the pandemic, the year 2019
had been marked by strong activity at
the WTO in terms of trade negotiations.
Talks on reducing fisheries subsidies
registered further progress, and
members continued discussions
on a range of issues in agriculture.
In parallel with these multilateral
negotiations, groups of WTO members
took substantial steps forward in
initiatives seeking to write new rules
for e-commerce, facilitating investment
for development, domestic regulation
of trade in services, and micro, small
and medium-sized enterprises. The
initiatives, which remain open to the
entire membership, drew interest from
a growing number of members.

Whether to safeguard public health
or to revive economic activity, it is only
through collective action that we can
respond effectively to the COVID-19

and economic situation. In a similar
vein, they are already deliberating on
options for holding our 12th Ministerial
Conference, which could not be held
as originally scheduled in Nur-Sultan,
Kazakhstan, in June 2020 because of
the pandemic.
Discussions on the ongoing process
of WTO reform also gained momentum
over the course of the year. Further
progress will now also have to take
account of the evolving health and
economic situation. The reform process
has nevertheless always been aimed
at strengthening and improving the
functioning of the system to make
the WTO more effective and more
responsive to members’ needs. Amid
the social and economic distress
shared by billions of people, some of
these needs have become painfully
clear. A key goal of WTO reform must
be to ensure that the organization is
properly equipped to contribute to the
economic recovery of all members.

Whether to
safeguard public
health or to revive
economic activity,
it is only through
collective action
that we can respond
effectively to the
COVID-19 crisis.

A key concern is the proper functioning
of the WTO’s dispute settlement
system, given the impasse in the
appointment of Appellate Body
members. The importance WTO
members attach to the institution’s
dispute settlement function was
underscored by the highest-ever level
of activity seen in 2019, with 23 dispute
settlement reports and decisions issued
during the course of the year. At the
same time, late in the year, members
could not reach consensus on a set of
proposals put forward by the then-chair
of the Dispute Settlement Body in an
attempt to address concerns about
the functioning of the Appellate Body.
I encourage members to consider the
compromises they would be willing to
make to maintain a vital two-step review
process for the settlement of trade
disputes and to avoid the prospect of
blocked rulings and unilateral retaliation.

also hosted the Global Review of Aid
for Trade, a WTO-led initiative aimed
at improving the trading capacity
of developing and least-developed
countries. The three-day event
brought over 1,500 participants to our
headquarters to share ideas and look
at examples of how targeted technical
and financial support has helped
countries use trade to bolster economic
diversification and empowerment.
Other events held at the WTO in 2019
included our annual Public Forum,
which attracted a record number of
participants – over 2,500 from 126
countries – to discuss how trade should
adapt to a changing world. The first-ever
World Cotton Day brought ministers
and key players in the cotton industry
to WTO headquarters to address the
challenges faced by cotton farmers
and the importance of the sector in
contributing to poverty reduction in
developing countries. The WTO also
hosted an International Forum on Food
Safety and Trade alongside the UN
Food and Agriculture Organization and
the World Health Organization.
Cooperation and solidarity among
governments and international
organizations will be essential for the
world to unite to tackle the coronavirus
pandemic and prepare the foundations
for economic revival. Trade will have
a vital role to play in making a strong,
sustainable and socially inclusive
recovery. We at the WTO are
committed to doing our part.

Roberto Azevêdo
Director-General

Another important function of the
WTO is our work to assist developing
countries to gain a better understanding
of how best to make the multilateral
trading system and the WTO rulebook
work for them. In 2019, the WTO
organized training courses for over
18,000 government officials, enhancing
their know-how and skills to help
their respective countries play a more
active role in world trade. The WTO

Introduction

Unde r s ta nd i ng t he W TO
Who we are

Negotiations

The WTO was born out of negotiations
aimed at progressively reducing obstacles
to trade. Where countries have faced trade
barriers and wanted them lowered, the
negotiations have helped to open markets for
trade. Conversely, in some circumstances,
WTO rules support maintaining trade
barriers – for example, to protect consumers
or the environment.

Trade flows

The system’s overriding purpose is to
help trade flow as freely as possible –
so long as there are no undesirable side
effects – because this stimulates economic
growth and employment and supports the
integration of developing countries into
the international trading system. Its rules
have to be transparent and predictable,
to ensure that individuals, companies and
governments know what the trade rules are
around the world, and to assure them that
there will be no sudden changes of policy.

World Trade Organization  Annual Report 2020

WTO agreements

At its heart are the WTO agreements,
negotiated and signed by the bulk of
the world’s trading nations. Essentially
contracts, these documents provide the
rules for international commerce and bind
governments to keep their trade policies
within agreed limits. Their goal is to help
producers of goods and services, exporters,
and importers conduct their business,
while allowing governments to meet social
and environmental objectives.

Trade relations

Trade relations often involve conflicting
interests. Agreements, including those
painstakingly negotiated in the WTO, often
need interpreting. The most harmonious
way to settle these differences is through a
neutral procedure based on an agreed legal
foundation. That is the purpose behind the
dispute settlement process written into
the WTO agreements.

Understanding the WTO
www.wto.org/whatiswto

-----------------------Page 10 End-----------------------

What we stand for
The WTO agreements are lengthy
and complex because they are
legal texts covering a wide range
of activities. But certain simple,
fundamental principles run
throughout all of these documents
and form the foundations of the
multilateral trading system.

1
2
3
4

6

Non-discrimination
A country should not discriminate between
its trading partners, and it should not
discriminate between its own and foreign
products, services or nationals.

Opening trade
Lowering trade barriers is an obvious way
to encourage trade; these barriers include
customs duties (or tariffs) and measures
such as import bans or quotas, that restrict
quantities selectively.

Predictability and transparency
Foreign companies, investors and
governments should be confident
that trade barriers will not be raised
arbitrarily. With stability and predictability,
investment is encouraged, jobs are
created and consumers can fully enjoy
the benefits of competition – such as
increased choice and lower prices.

More competitive
Discouraging “unfair” practices, such as
export subsidies and dumping products
at below normal value to gain market share;
the issues are complex, and the rules try
to establish what is fair or unfair, and how
governments can respond, in particular
by charging additional import duties
calculated to compensate for damage
caused by unfair trade.

More beneficial for less
developed countries
Over three-quarters of WTO members are
developing economies or in transition to
market economies. The WTO agreements
give them transition periods to adjust to
WTO provisions and, in the case of the
Trade Facilitation Agreement, provide for
practical support for implementation of
the Agreement.

Protect the environment
The WTO agreements permit members
to take measures to protect not only
public, animal and plant health but also the
environment. However, these measures
must be applied in the same way to both
national and foreign businesses: members
must not use environmental protection
measures as a means of introducing
discriminatory trade barriers.

Introduction

W hat we do
•	 Trade negotiations
•	 Implementation and monitoring
•	 Dispute settlement
•	 Supporting development and
building trade capacity
•	 Outreach
The WTO is
run by its
164 member
governments.

•	 The WTO is run by its member governments. All major decisions are
made by the membership as a whole, either by ministers (who usually
meet at least once every two years) or by their ambassadors or
delegates (who meet regularly in Geneva).
•	 While the WTO is driven by its member states, it could not function
without its Secretariat to coordinate the activities.
•	 The Secretariat employs over 600 staff, and its experts – lawyers,
economists, statisticians and communications experts – assist
WTO members on a daily basis to ensure, among other things, that
negotiations progress smoothly, and that the rules of international
trade are correctly applied and enforced.

Trade negotiations
The WTO agreements cover goods, services
and intellectual property. They spell out
the principles of trade-opening and the
permitted exceptions, and set procedures
for settling disputes. They include countries’
commitments to lower trade barriers and
to open services markets. The agreements
are renegotiated from time to time and new
agreements can be added, as was the case at
the 2013 and 2015 ministerial conferences.

Implementation and monitoring
The WTO agreements require governments
to make their trade policies transparent by
notifying the WTO about laws in force and
measures adopted. Various WTO councils
and committees seek to ensure that these
requirements are being followed and that
WTO agreements are being properly
implemented. All WTO members must
undergo periodic scrutiny of their trade
policies and practices.

Dispute settlement
The WTO’s procedure for resolving trade
disputes under the Dispute Settlement
Understanding is vital for enforcing the rules
and therefore for ensuring that trade flows
smoothly. Countries bring disputes to the
WTO if they think their rights under the WTO
agreements are being infringed. Judgments
by specially appointed independent experts
are based on interpretations of the WTO
agreements and individual countries’
commitments.

Supporting development
and building trade capacity
The WTO agreements contain special
provisions for developing countries, including
longer time periods to implement agreements
and commitments, measures to increase their
trading opportunities, and support to help them
build their trade capacity, handle disputes and
implement technical standards. The WTO
organizes many technical cooperation missions
to developing countries and holds numerous
courses in Geneva for government officials. The
Aid for Trade initiative aims to help developing
countries develop the skills and infrastructure
needed to expand their trade.

Outreach
The WTO maintains regular dialogue with
the business community, non-governmental
organizations, parliamentarians, other
international organizations, the media and the
general public on various aspects of the WTO
and its negotiations, with the aim of enhancing
cooperation and increasing awareness of
WTO activities.
