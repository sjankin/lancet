          The IDB Group comprises the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), IDB Invest (the
          commercial name of the Inter-American Investment Corporation, IIC) and IDB LAB (the
          commercial name of the Multilateral Investment Fund, which is administered by the
          IDB).

          Founded in 1959, the IDB is the world’s oldest and largest regional, multilateral
          development bank. It serves as the main source of multilateral financing for economic,
          social and institutional development in Latin America and the Caribbean.

          The mission of IDB Invest is to promote the economic development of Latin America
          and the Caribbean through the private sector. It supports private sector and state-
          owned enterprises through loans, equity investments and guarantees. IDB Invest also
          partners with clients to provide advisory and training services.

          IDB Lab is the IDB Group’s innovation laboratory. It conducts high-risk experiments to
          test new models for engaging and inspiring the private sector to solve development
          challenges in Latin America and the Caribbean.

          The IDB’s financial resources come from its 48 member countries and from borrowing
          in financial markets, trust funds that it administers, and co-financing ventures. Its debt
          rating is AAA, the highest available.

          The IDB is headquartered in Washington, D.C., and has offices in its 26 member countries
          in Latin America and the Caribbean, as well as in Madrid and Tokyo.

Message from the President

Like the rest of the world, Latin America and the Carib-
bean faced an unprecedented set of challenges in 2020.
In addition to the human tragedy caused by the corona-
virus pandemic, the region suffered a historic economic
contraction of more than 8% of GDP. An estimated 34
million people lost their jobs, and at least 40 million fell
into poverty. Unless we reverse these setbacks, the re-
gion could lose much of the economic and social ground
gained in the 21st century.
    We are not willing to accept such a fate. Our coun-
tries have not bowed to the crisis, but instead, are striving
to overcome it with the creativity, resilience and opti-
mism that have always been their hallmark. Some governments have mounted pub-
lic-health outreach campaigns that have succeeded in mitigating the virus’s impact.
Others have deployed subsidies and cash transfers to ensure that millions of fami-
lies do not lose their homes and can meet basic needs. We have also seen good pol-
icies to support small and medium-sized enterprises, and stimulus programs in key
productive sectors.
    We are proud that the IDB Group contributed to many of these efforts in 2020.
In addition to transitioning smoothly to telework, we reformulated tools and pro-
cesses to fast-track operations in response to the crisis. Our approvals increased by
10% and our disbursements by 38%, compared to 2019. Among our sovereign guar-
anteed approvals, 36 projects, totaling $6.63 billion, directly addressed the emer-
gency. A proposal was approved to expand the use of contingent credit facilities
for natural-disaster emergencies to include public-health risks. The Board of Ex-
ecutive Directors authorized the reformulation of active projects to redirect a fur-
ther $1.31 billion to the contingency. The IDB’s response to the pandemic reached
$7.94 billion, and total approvals with sovereign guarantees for 2020 set a record
of $12.64 billion.
    IDB Invest also had a stand-out year, as commitments reached $6.2 billion and
mobilization reached $2.3 billion. For its part, IDB Lab increased its number of op-
erations by 40%, from 90 projects to 126, of which 20 were directly related to the
pandemic.




                                                                     IDB ANNUAL REPORT 2020   1
-----------------------Page 7 End-----------------------

       Beyond the figures, I want to emphasize the dynamism and diversity of our pan-
    demic response. To list just a few examples, we coordinated procurement processes
    so that several countries could obtain medical supplies on the international market
    at favorable prices. In Bolivia, we approved a loan that enabled the government to
    guarantee a minimum income for 750,000 vulnerable older adults. And in Colom-
    bia, IDB Lab helped finance InnspiraMED, an initiative that designed and manufac-
    tured low-cost respirators using local talent.
       Although our work to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 dominated the agenda
    in 2020, we also responded to emergencies such as Hurricanes Eta and Iota, which
    caused severe damage in Central America and the Caribbean in November. In total,
    the Bank made available $500 million in reprogrammed resources and $1.2 billion in
    funds for new operations to finance resilient reconstruction of damaged infrastruc-
    ture in the affected countries.
       Expectations could not be higher for our work in 2021. Once again, the IDB will
    be a strategic partner in the region. We have announced our capacity to finance the
    purchase of COVID-19 vaccines for up to $1 billion. In parallel to our public-health ef-
    forts, the IDB Group will focus on the creation of formal jobs through infrastructure
    investments and an ambitious strategy to expand integration through the nearshor-
    ing of supply chains.
       We will also support governments as they seek to create more employment op-
    portunities and promote women-led businesses, whether through better access to
    credit or training programs and the use of technology. Mindful of the challenges of
    climate change, we will develop a new window for financing resilient-infrastructure
    projects and adaptation to adverse conditions that affect farming, transportation,
    tourism and other vital industries.
       The year 2021 will be a watershed in the history of our region and of the IDB. As
    an institution, we have an opportunity to be the leading international partner for our
    countries as they face a crossroads, where they will have to decide what kind of fu-
    ture they want to build for their societies. I am certain that we will be bold enough,
    creative enough and disciplined enough to meet this great challenge.

Executive Directors

The IDB’s shareholders — its 48 member countries — are represented by the Board
of Governors, the highest decision-making body of the Bank. The Governors dele-
gate many of their powers to the Board of Executive Directors, whose 14 members
they elect or appoint for three-year terms. Executive Directors for the United States
and Canada represent their own countries; all others represent groups of countries.
The Board of Executive Directors also includes 14 Alternates, who have full power to
act when their principals are absent. The Board of Executive Directors is responsi-
ble for day-to-day oversight of the Bank’s operations. It establishes the institution’s
policies, approves projects, sets interest rates for Bank loans, authorizes borrowings
in capital markets, and approves the institution’s administrative budget. The work of
the Board of Executive Directors is guided by the Regulations of the Board of Ex-
ecutive Directors and the Code of Ethics for Executive Directors. The agendas and
minutes of the meetings of the Board of Executive Directors and its standing com-
mittees are public documents.

Operational Summary
                                                                                       1
Loan Approvals

In 2020, the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) approved 82 sovereign guaran-
teed loan operations with total financing of $12.64 billion. The sovereign guaranteed
lending program included 57 investment projects for $6.38 billion. 19 policy-based
loan (PBL) projects for $4.96 billion, and five special development lending projects
for $1.23 billion.
    Investment projects included 12 operations for $805  million under conditional
credit lines for investment projects (CCLIPs).
    Of the 19 PBL projects, one multiple-tranche operation for $90  million and
18  programmatic policy-based loans for $4.87  billion were approved. Fourteen of
these loans (totaling $4.17 billion) corresponded to the first stage, and four (totaling
$692 million) corresponded to subsequent stages.
    Since 2016, the total value of sovereign guaranteed approvals has been rising
steadily. The average annual approved value in the last five years was $11.61 billion,
or 13% more than the preceding five-year period.
    The program of sovereign guaranteed loan approvals anchors the financing of
projects with a total cost of $13.41 billion, including $12.37 billion from the Ordinary
Capital, $100  million from the IDB Grant Facility, $166  million from Bank-adminis-
tered funds, and $774 million from other sources, including local contributions.
    Additionally, in 2020, the Bank approved four contingent credit facilities (CCF)
for $452 million, as well as eight new CCLIPs for $4.66 billion.
    Between 2019 and 2020, approvals for Group C and D countries grew 45%, from
$4.87  billion to $7.09  billion. These approvals reached 56% of total approvals in
2020, 12% higher than in 2019.



Approvals by Country Department, Sector, and Economic
Activity Group

By country department, 32% of approved financing went to countries of the
Southern Cone (CSC); 36% to the countries of Central America, Mexico, Panama,
the Dominican Republic, and Haiti (CID); 24% to the countries of the Andean

    BOX 1
    The Bank’s Operational Response to the Pandemic




    The onset of the global pandemic posed an unprecedented challenge for the Bank in 2020. To
    expeditiously address both the public-health and socioeconomic impacts, the Bank designed
    operational tools described in the proposal for the IDB Response to the COVID‑19 Pandemic Outbreak.
    Prepared early in the second quarter of the year, the proposal included fast-track procedures for
    processing sovereign guaranteed operations and substantial changes to loans in execution. The
    Bank also worked closely with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank and other
    multilateral institutions to ensure a coordinated and complementary operational response.
       To enable the rapid approval of operations during the crisis, the IDB developed a prototype
    project in each of following response areas: the social sector, vulnerable populations, productive
    fabric and employment, and public policy and fiscal management.
       Accordingly, the IDB’s support focused on the following four priority areas:

       •	   immediate response to the public-health emergency;
       •	   safety nets for vulnerable populations;
       •	   economic productivity and employment;
       •	   fiscal policies to cushion economic impacts.

       The Bank also approved a proposal to expand the use of CCFs to include public-health risks.
       The IDB approved 36 projects for $6.63 billion in resources from the 2020 operational program
    in the four priority areas. Along with new approvals, the Board of Executive Directors authorized
    the reformulation of active-portfolio projects to redirect an additional $1.31 billion to address the
    emergency. As a result, the IDB approved $7.94 billion in total financing and redirection of sovereign
    guaranteed projects, 60% of which went to Group C and D countries, which include the smallest
    and most vulnerable countries in the region.

Institutions for Development Sector (IFD)

In 2020, IFD reoriented its ongoing support for the institutional development of
Latin American and Caribbean countries to reflect the extraordinary circumstances
of the pandemic.
    In order to quickly meet the liquidity needs of countries and promote economic
recovery during the crisis, the Bank approved six loans under PBL-based programs
for public policy and fiscal management in Colombia, the Dominican Republic,
El  Salvador, Paraguay, Trinidad and Tobago, and Uruguay. These operations en-
sured the availability of fiscal resources during the public-health emergency, includ-
ing measures to enable telework and the remote delivery of public services.
    In the area of fiscal management, IFD enabled policy actions to protect the in-
comes of vulnerable families and affected businesses during the pandemic, and to
lay the groundwork for fiscal recovery. These operations applied lessons learned
from the 2008 international crisis and leveraged partners such as the IMF and the
IDB’s Social Protection and Health Division (SPH). IFD also helped countries accel-
erate the adoption of digital fiscal management to increase tax revenue and incen-
tivize labor formalization.
    IFD worked with several governments that saw the crisis as an opportunity to im-
plement innovations to better serve citizens. It focused on bolstering institutions
and ensuring the continued delivery of public services, while increasing the number
of loans to support digital transformation in the public sector and doubling fund-
ing for cybersecurity in these operations. It advanced technical dialogues to foster
greater transparency and integrity in public administration. And it helped govern-
ments address the particular challenges posed by the pandemic in policing, justice,
prison management, and domestic and gender-based violence.
    The Bank also continued to underwrite public policies in competitiveness, tech-
nology and innovation, as part of an ongoing strategy to improve the business en-
vironment and foster entrepreneurship. To this end, IFD financed policy reforms for
productive development and the creative economy in Colombia; resilient growth in
The Bahamas; economic recovery in Peru; and business productivity in Paraguay.
    In the area of connectivity, markets and finance, IFD focused on safeguarding
employment and promoting economic recovery through global credit programs.
