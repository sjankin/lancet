Message from the
Secretary General
The year 2020 was enormously challenging for the OSCE
and the wider international community.
Just a year ago, few would have predicted the serious
impact that COVID-19 would have on global health and
the livelihood of millions of people. It has intensified
inequalities, fed distrust, and made our already difficult
security environment more unstable and unpredictable.
OSCE activities and our efforts to prevent and manage
conflict have also been affected by the pandemic, but as
numerous examples in this report show, our Organization
has been able to continue fulfilling its mandates while
ensuring duty of care to our staff. Even in lockdown
phases, OSCE decision-making bodies continued meeting
and our field operations and Institutions continued to
support our participating States, including in crisis settings
where the OSCE plays a critical role.

We have every reason to be ambitious, and to work
together toward concrete outcomes that will strengthen
security for us all.

Helga Maria Schmid
OSCE Secretary General
Vienna, 2021

The OSCE’s adaptability and flexibility in the face of
COVID-19 are the shared achievement of OSCE staff
across our Organization. I thank them for their exceptional
commitment. I also wish to thank the 2020 Albanian OSCE
Chairmanship for ably steering our Organization through
an extraordinarily challenging year, and to recognize the
professional leadership of my predecessor, Secretary
General Thomas Greminger, and Ambassador Tuula Yrjölä
as Officer in Charge during a very difficult period.
Since taking up my post, I have been deeply impressed by
how much good work the OSCE does every day. I will do
my utmost to promote OSCE principles and commitments,
all dimensions of our comprehensive approach to security,
and problem-solving through dialogue and co-operation.
I will work hard to build support for the OSCE’s important
role in strengthening security and stability in our region,
develop more coherent cross-dimensional responses to
overcome increasingly complex security challenges and
raise the OSCE’s profile.
I will promote closer co-operation with our Asian and
Mediterranean Partners for Co-operation, and with the
United Nations and other key international and regional
organizations. I will strive to ensure that the OSCE makes
further progress towards greater diversity and equal
representation between men and women across all levels
of the Organization. I will also ensure that the OSCE
maintains its vibrant engagement with civil society and
with young people.
I am immensely proud to work for the OSCE. There is no
other security organization in our region with so much
potential to bridge differences, to rebuild trust, and to help
reduce tensions.

Overcoming Adversity

Chairperson-in-Office: Edi Rama
www.osce.org/chairmanship

The Albanian Chairmanship year was momentous for the OSCE in many respects. The year
2020 marked the 45th anniversary of the Helsinki Final Act and the 30th anniversary of the
Charter of Paris for a New Europe, but it was also characterized by a series of new and
unprecedented challenges.
Albania opened the year by noting that, as a small
state that has undergone a major transition, it had
drawn outsized strength and stability from being part
of this values-based security community. Through the
Chairmanship, it sought to give back to the Organization.
The programme set by the Albanian OSCE 2020
Chairmanship was based on three key objectives:
 Making a difference on the ground;
 Implementing our commitments together;
 Building stability through dialogue.
The Chairmanship prioritized key issues that the OSCE
community continues to face: be it military confrontation, the
malign use of information and communication technology,
respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, violent
extremism and radicalization, gender equality or the blurred
line between state and non-state activity.

But 2020 will be best remembered for other unpredicted
developments, including the surge of the COVID-19
pandemic, which posed new tests for our governments,
communities and the work of the Organization,
including the mid-year leadership vacuum in the OSCE
executive structures, the situation in Belarus following
the presidential election and the outburst of heavy
fighting in the Nagorno-Karabakh context. These events
placed new pressures on the daily work of the OSCE
throughout 2020, which the Chairmanship endeavoured
to overcome.
In the face of this adversity, the Albanian Chairmanship
effectively delivered a suite of new deliverables, maintained
the OSCE’s operational activities amid the disruption
caused by COVID-19 and appointed new management for
the Organization.

-----------------------Page 9 End-----------------------

MAKING A DIFFERENCE ON THE GROUND
The OSCE has proven its ability to make a difference
on the ground, be it through engaging in all levels of the
conflict cycle, observing elections or supporting reforms.
The Albanian Chairmanship aimed to promote the work of
the OSCE where it is closest to the people.
The Chairmanship upheld its priority of supporting conflict
resolution efforts with respect to Ukraine. The timely
extension of the mandate and adoption of the Special
Monitoring Mission (SMM) budget in March, the first
major negotiation accomplished by the Chairmanship,
led to a landmark 8 per cent budget increase. By forging
consensus around a solid budget for the OSCE’s flagship
operation, especially amid the pandemic, Albania held
true to its commitment to support the work of some 1,300
OSCE staff on the ground. The additional resources,
including unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), bolstered
remote monitoring, as there was a partial staff reduction
during the pandemic; this was a critical enabling factor in
the SMM’s monitoring and reporting capabilities in eastern
Ukraine.
The Chairmanship supported the Special Representative
in Ukraine and in the Trilateral Contact Group (TCG) and
the overall TCG process, including by helping to unlock
critical situations. The Chairmanship reintroduced the
practice of convening informal briefings by TCG Working
Group co-ordinators, which was much appreciated by the
delegations of the participating States in Vienna.
Seven years into the conflict, 2020 saw an
unprecedented and highly needed largely holding
ceasefire in eastern Ukraine, after the measures to
strengthen it, agreed in the TCG, took effect on 27 July.
Some days the SMM recorded no ceasefire violations
at all. For almost four months, the SMM registered no
civilian casualties or damage to infrastructure from
shelling or gunfire. The Chairmanship followed up on the
situation and urged compliance with the terms of the
ceasefire.
The Chairmanship worked hard politically and practically
to find a solution to the restrictions placed on the freedom
of movement of SMM staff across the contact line in
the spring, which had impeded the fulfilment of the
Mission’s mandate and put in question the sustainability
of the SMM’s operations. In early summer, the SMM
returned with a substantive presence in non-governmentcontrolled areas in eastern Ukraine. Despite this positive
development, remaining restrictions still hamper the
Mission’s activities.
On Moldova, the Chairmanship, through its Special
Representative for the Transdniestrian Settlement Process,
maintained dialogue between the Sides also during
the pandemic and successfully negotiated a ministerial
statement supporting the talks at the Ministerial Council
(MC) meeting. The Chairmanship also supported the
important work of the Mission to Moldova.
The Chairmanship reacted swiftly and publicly to
developments in Belarus after the presidential election in
August and convened a special meeting of the Permanent
Council (PC). The Chairperson-in-Office, together with
the incoming 2021 Chair, made an offer to visit Belarus to
facilitate dialogue. The Chairmanship’s actions highlighted
the value of the OSCE as an inclusive organization.
8

The Chairmanship also prioritized conflict-affected
populations in Georgia. Through its Special Representative
for the South Caucasus, it facilitated the resumption of the
Incident Prevention and Response Mechanism (IPRM) in
Ergneti and convened two meetings, while it was possible
to hold only one in-person round of talks in the format of
the Geneva International Discussions (GID) in December
with the aim to address the security, humanitarian and
human rights challenges on the ground in full compliance
with the 12 August 2008 Ceasefire Agreement. It used
its good offices to facilitate communication across the
divide concerning the challenge posed by the COVID-19
pandemic, as well as the efficient use of water through
a shared canal, benefitting communities on both sides.
Promoting youth dialogue, the Chairmanship played a
leadership role and contributed financially to the OSCE
Autumn Academy, and increased regular contact with all
stakeholders in the conflict context. It urged progress on
long-standing missing persons cases in close
co-ordination with local and international stakeholders.
When fighting erupted in the context of the NagornoKarabakh conflict, the Chairperson-in-Office condemned
the violence and urged a return to substantive talks under
OSCE auspices. The Chairmanship convened a special
PC meeting on 29 September to provide a platform for
dialogue and to show the international community’s
concern about the deteriorating situation on the ground.
The Chairmanship ensured that the OSCE executive
structures were kept abreast of conflict developments
and initiated, with other partners, steps to properly
prepare OSCE staff through internal trainings for further
engagement in the new situation on the ground.
The Chairmanship maintained open and friendly relations
with Central Asia and used an inclusive approach to
discuss the current and future of the OSCE’s engagement
in the region. The Chairmanship paid close attention
to the volatile situation in Kyrgyzstan after the October
parliamentary elections.
Albania continued to support peace, stability, security and
good governance in South-Eastern Europe, including by
supporting strong field operations there.
On the 20th anniversary of United Nations Security
Council Resolution (UNSCR) 1325 on Women, Peace
and Security, Albania engaged in a number of high-level
political and military dialogues to promote the enhanced
implementation of the women, peace and security agenda,
including through senior-level participation in the Forum
for Security Cooperation (FSC) and other events. Albania
co-championed women, peace and security in the OSCE,
including by assuming responsibility as FSC Co-ordinator
on UNSCR 1325.

COVID-19 PANDEMIC
Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the Chairmanship, with the
support of the OSCE Secretariat, ensured the uninterrupted
operations of OSCE activities in Vienna and of OSCE field
operations throughout the crisis, while paying utmost
attention to its duty-of-care obligations towards OSCE staff
in the field and at OSCE institutions, as well as participating
States’ delegates.
Confronted with the first lockdown, not even a single
session of the PC was missed, as contingency planning
for the transition to remote work was already in place.
The Chairmanship also swiftly negotiated a working
methodology for remote negotiations and decision-making.
This ensured the timely adoption of the Organization’s
essential administrative and financial instruments,
including the Unified Budget, and the appointment of the
officers-in-charge for the executive structures. The first
meeting in a blended format was held on 9 March; the
first online Permanent Council meeting, on 23 April; and
the first decision taken by the PC in an online meeting

IMPLEMENTING OUR COMMITMENTS
TOGETHER
The Albanian Chairmanship was fully committed to
ensuring that the human rights and fundamental freedoms
enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights
are enjoyed throughout the OSCE region. At the core of
its programme, the Albanian Chairmanship considered
imperative that all OSCE principles and commitments be
met, including those set out in the OSCE Copenhagen
Document. Many of our contemporary security challenges
will continue for the foreseeable future; others will evolve
and new ones will emerge. This requires that participating
States reflect on how to employ and adapt OSCE
instruments to our changing context, while continuing to
protect and promote rights and freedoms.
The Albanian Chairmanship prioritized action to counter
gender-based violence with a view to the effective
implementation of legislation and action plans that tackle,
reduce and ultimately end this unacceptable phenomenon.
Also, the Chairmanship effectively mainstreamed gender
in all activities, ensuring equal representation in all events
and holding a successful online event that produced the
“Gender Equality Report Card” marking the anniversary of
UNSCR 1325. The Chairmanship adopted a new approach
in all its events during 2020: all panels included at least
one female speaker.
The Supplementary Human Dimension Meetings and
the first annual, mandated and open OSCE conference
held in blended format pioneered innovative technical–
political solutions adopted for other meetings. While the
Organization had to deal with the very difficult decision of
not holding the 2020 Human Dimension Implementation
Meeting, it was critically important for the future to ensure
a PC decision acknowledging the year’s exceptional
circumstances. The Chairmanship expanded a series of
webinars with ODIHR and the offices of the Representative
on Freedom of the Media (RFoM) and the High
Commissioner on National Minorities (HCNM).
The MC decision on prevention and eradication of torture
and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or

occurred on 30 April – illustrating the rapid pace of
institutional innovation led by the Albanian Chairmanship.
A statement recognizing the unprecedented impact of the
COVID-19 pandemic on our societies was endorsed by
56 participating States.

“We have delivered on our ambition to promote gender
equality in the OSCE by creating a gender balance in the
top jobs. Leading a fully gender-balanced government,
which is among the top five in the United Nations in
that regard, I am very proud to leave as a mark of my
Chairmanship the fully gender-balanced Secretariat of the
OSCE. With Ann Linde as OSCE Chairperson-in-Office
and Helga Schmid as the OSCE Secretary General, the
Organization will have a great duo at its top during the
whole next year.”

punishment was the first OSCE decision on the topic and
the most comprehensive text in the human dimension in
more than a decade.
Corruption, a phenomenon that creates obstacles to
economic growth and fuels inequality, impunity, and
instability, was addressed throughout the Albanian
Chairmanship. Albania notably promoted the OSCE’s
action to foster good governance and combat corruption
by considering responses made possible by digital
public services, as well as the links between corruption
and money laundering, terrorism and environmental
degradation. The MC decision on preventing and

BUILDING STABILITY THROUGH DIALOGUE
The OSCE is a unique platform for dialogue. Its success
stories are rooted in mutual understanding and consensus
built up among participating States over time. Inspired
by the 30th anniversary of the Charter of Paris for a New
Europe, the Albanian Chairmanship sought to revitalize
dialogue within the Organization.
The Albanian Chairmanship offered all participating
States equal status in dialogue and exchange in an
effort to rebuild trust between participating States and
lay out solutions to shared challenges, culminating with
the appointment of a new Secretary General and new
heads of institutions, and achieving new standards in both
geographical and gender representation.

combating corruption through digitalization and increased
transparency was the first decision elaborating upon and
introducing new commitments linking the use of digital
tools with the fight against corruption – and the first
decision on anti-corruption since the MC meeting held in
Basel in 2014.
A balance between economic and environmental
activities was ensured, including between economic
and environmental sessions in the three Economic
and Environmental Forum (EEF) meetings. The
first-ever blended EEF, Economic and Environmental
Committee and Economic and Environmental
Implementation Meetings were arranged and
successfully organized.
The 2020 Annual Security Review Conference was the first
major security conference held in a virtual/hybrid format.
With the first-ever OSCE “Cyber/ICT Security Day” in June
and the OSCE-wide Cyber/ICT Security Conference in
2020, Albania stepped up its commitment to advance
multi-stakeholder approaches to cyber/ICT security. For
the first time, the Chair also led discussions on gender
mainstreaming in cyber/ICT security efforts.
Albania prioritized initiatives to counter the illicit spread of
small arms and light weapons (SALW), and increasing the
security of stockpiles of conventional ammunition (SCA)
was a priority. The Chairmanship organized initiatives
to enhance international efforts to combat trafficking in
human beings (CTHB) together with the Office of Special
Representative and Co-ordinator for CTHB.
Albania co-organized the first-ever conference on a
comprehensive approach to addressing organized crime
through strategic partnerships in October 2020, putting
the topic of organized crime back on the OSCE agenda.
The 2020 “OSCE-Wide Counter Terrorism Conference”
in September marked the largest dialogue format of its
kind in the OSCE, with the aim of enhancing high-level
and grass-roots partnerships, and it gathered more than
500 participants. The MC declaration on strengthening
co-operation in countering transnational organized crime
was the first ministerial document on the topic since 2006,
and the first commitment in the politico-military dimension
since 2016.
10

Given Albania’s reputation for social and religious harmony,
the Albanian Chairmanship backed initiatives promoting
tolerance and non-discrimination and others that invest in
youth and religious dialogue in the OSCE region. As 2020
marked the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz,
the Albanian Chairmanship intensified efforts to promote
human dignity and confront hate and hate speech
whenever and wherever they occur. At the beginning of the
year, the Chairmanship organized the “Tirana Conference
on Anti-Semitism” with the participation of high-ranking
officials from OSCE participating States, as well as civil
society and academia.
Security in the OSCE area is not only determined by our
internal relations, but it is also inextricably linked to that
of our neighbours. Therefore, the Albanian Chairmanship
focused on promoting dialogue with OSCE Mediterranean
and Asian Partners for Co-operation. The Chairmanship
intensified co-operation with Asian Partners as evidenced
by monthly in-depth discussions and the first PC meeting
dedicated to reviewing the OSCE’s co-operation with the
Asian Partners, held on 3 September. The adoption of
the MC declaration on co-operation with the OSCE
Asian Partners was important, especially in view of the
25th anniversary of the establishment of this partnership,
which Albania will proudly chair in 2021.
Equally, the Albanian Chairmanship, despite the difficulties
created by the COVID-19 pandemic, managed to foster
exchanges with other international actors, in particular
with the European Union (EU) and the UN, and to
bolster interparliamentary dialogue and the fundamental
contribution of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly.
The Albanian Chairmanship undertook action to promote
dialogue, trust and partnership between governments and
civil society groups and grass-roots organizations, bearing
in mind that they play a central role in the monitoring and
promotion of rights and fundamental freedoms in our
region.
Similarly, Albania drew on the experiences of SouthEastern Europe, one of the youngest regions in the
OSCE, to prioritize action in support of youth in peace
and security. The engagement of young people remains
essential for establishing a culture of peace, dialogue,
justice, peaceful coexistence, trust and reconciliation, and
their active political participation is a precondition for a
sound democratic process. The Albanian Chairmanship
upheld its commitment to mainstream youth in all major
events with the aim of strengthening the role of the Special
Representative on Youth and Security in the OSCE agenda.

TRILATERAL CONTACT GROUP
AMBASSADOR HEIDI GRAU
Special Representative of the Chairperson-in-Office
in Ukraine and in the Trilateral Contact Group
The Trilateral Contact Group (TCG) brings together
representatives from the OSCE, Ukraine and Russia as
well as, by agreement of its members, participants from
certain areas of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. It is
the only forum where the conflict sides meet regularly to
discuss the implementation of the Minsk agreements,
as well as practical issues of critical importance for the
civilian population. Its agenda covers a wide range of
topics in the political, security, socio-economic and
humanitarian fields. Effective co-ordination with the
SMM is ensured thanks to the fact that the SMM’s Chief
Monitor is also the Co-ordinator of the TCG Working
Group on Security Issues.
Despite the COVID-19 pandemic, the TCG managed to
meet throughout the year, according to plan, moving
online after mid-March 2020. While the pandemic led
to the further disconnection of the non-government-

controlled areas of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions
from the rest of Ukraine, the TCG and its Working Group
on Economic Issues devoted constant attention to
enabling the supply of and payment transfers for water,
electricity, gas and telecommunications across the
contact line. The SMM’s support made possible needed
repairs and the functioning of essential infrastructure in
the conflict zone. In April, another exchange of conflictrelated detainees took place that had been agreed
upon in the TCG. In July, the TCG adopted a landmark
ceasefire decision that significantly reduced the level
of violence in the conflict area compared with previous
years.
Building on previous achievements and upholding the
conclusions agreed by the Paris Normandy summit of 9
December 2019, the TCG pursued efforts to implement
the political aspects of the Minsk agreements. In
addition, it agreed new areas for military disengagement
and mine clearance. The opening of two new crossing
points in the Luhansk region was in progress at the time
of writing. When completed, they will greatly facilitate
travel across the contact line, considerably improving life
for the local population.

Ann Linde in Stockholm. In Geneva, together with the
Co-Chairs, he briefed and exchanged views with the

Since the 9 November 2020 statement that brought
the fighting to an end and the deployment of Russian
peacekeepers to the region, Ambassador Kasprzyk has
been working with the OSCE Chairmanship, the Minsk
Group Co-Chairs and the sides to define how best to fulfil
the mandate of the Office going forward.

THE HIGH-LEVEL PLANNING GROUP
Lieutenant Colonel Sulo Mustafaraj

From January to March 2020, the Personal
Representative, Ambassador Andrzej Kasprzyk,
and his team conducted monitoring exercises and
continued to look for opportunities to promote further
confidence-building measures with the consent of the
sides. Throughout the year, the Office supported the
Chairperson-in-Office and the Minsk Group Co-Chairs
and provided a continuous overview of the situation
on the ground.
At the beginning of the year, the Office conducted
monitoring exercises six times on the line of contact and
three times on the border. In addition, the Office provided
support to a humanitarian operation in February on the
border, in collaboration with the International Committee of
the Red Cross (ICRC), to locate and return the remains of
a missing serviceman. Ambassador Kasprzyk supported
the activity of the Minsk Group Co-Chairs, including at the
meeting of the foreign ministers of Armenia and Azerbaijan
in Geneva in January. He also participated in consultations
with Russia’s Deputy Foreign Minister in Moscow in
January and Turkey’s Foreign Minister in Ankara in March.
The situation following the spread of COVID-19 led to the
closure of international borders throughout the region,
travel restrictions and restrictions to avoid face-to-face
contacts. This forced the suspension of the Office’s
monitoring activity from April.
During the war from 27 September to 10 November 2020,
the Office worked around the clock, and Ambassador
Kasprzyk was in constant contact with high-ranking
interlocutors from Armenia and Azerbaijan, as well as
with the Chairmanship and the Minsk Group Co-Chairs.
In October, Ambassador Kasprzyk travelled to Moscow,
Washington, DC, and Geneva to assist in meetings with
the foreign ministers of Armenia and Azerbaijan, together

CHAIRMANSHIP

Established in 1994, the High-Level Planning Group
(HLPG) makes recommendations to the Chairpersonin-Office on developing a plan for the establishment of
a multinational peacekeeping force for the NagornoKarabakh conflict, dealt with by the OSCE Minsk
Conference. Many of the activities in the 2020 Annual
Work Plan were severely curtailed due to the COVID-19
pandemic. To mitigate this situation, the HLPG adjusted
its posture to execute its tasks using a blended format,
focusing primarily on online work.
The nature of peacekeeping continues to evolve. An
iterative analysis of emerging trends and practices enabled
the HLPG to develop and maintain the necessary levels
of competency to address the challenges related to the
planning for the possible deployment of a peacekeeping
mission. To this end, the HLPG members participated
in a wide range of conferences, courses and seminars.
Additionally, close liaison was maintained with relevant
organizations and institutions. Among other things, the
HLPG completed the 2019 integration of Environmental
Protection into the planning process.

SOUTH CAUCASUS

TRANSDNIESTRIAN CONFLICT
AMBASSADOR
THOMAS MAYRHARTING

AMBASSADOR
RUDOLF MICHALKA
Special Representative
of the OSCE
Chairperson-in-Office
for the South Caucasus

The overall situation related to the aftermath of the August
2008 war in Georgia remained free of military hostilities,
and against the backdrop of the global COVID-19
pandemic the Albanian Chairmanship focused its efforts
on the situation of conflict-affected populations. The
OSCE Special Representative of the Chairperson-in-Office
for the South Caucasus, Ambassador Rudolf Michalka,
worked hard to promote co-operation and pragmatism
on public health issues, which the OSCE nurtured
through its good offices. The OSCE was able to increase
its regular contact with all stakeholders and, jointly with
the European Union Monitoring Mission in Georgia, to
convene two meetings of the Incident Prevention and
Response Mechanism in Ergneti, an important platform
for de-escalating tension and addressing concrete issues
on the ground. Many of the dialogue efforts of the Geneva
International Discussions had to be postponed, although
Ambassador Michalka and his fellow Co-Chairs from
the European Union and the United Nations ultimately
facilitated one in-person round of talks in Geneva, on
10–11 December 2020, with relevant pandemic mitigation
measures in place. The Chairmanship also supported
further confidence-building measures related to youth, and
paid particular attention to the issue of missing persons.
Two topics of special focus were women, peace and
security and efforts to make the OSCE’s approach more
inclusive.

Special Representative
of the OSCE
Chairperson-in-Office
for the Transdniestrian
Settlement Process
In 2020, the Albanian Chairmanship worked in close cooperation with the OSCE Mission to Moldova to promote
full implementation of the Berlin Plus “package of eight”
and to facilitate discussions on further confidence-building
measures. Special Representative Thomas Mayr-Harting
made three visits for meetings with the Sides, including
an informal brainstorming session with both political
representatives in Bulboaca/Bender on 3–4 March 2020.
While these contacts helped identify potential next steps –
the frequency of meetings between the Sides was similar
to that of 2019 – the COVID-19 pandemic and related
measures had a growing impact, in particular regarding
interconnectivity between both banks of the Dniester/
Nistru River. In co-ordination with the OSCE Mission
to Moldova, the Special Representative was in regular
informal contact with the Sides, mediators and observers
to help overcome these problems. Despite intense efforts,
it proved impossible to organize a conference in the
5+2 format, especially due to pandemic-related travel
constraints. At the virtual 27th OSCE Ministerial Council in
Tirana on 4 December 2020, the 57 participating States
adopted a ministerial statement on the negotiations on
the Transdniestrian Settlement process in the 5+2 format,
which also presents priorities for forthcoming work.

COMBATING CORRUPTION

PROMOTING GENDER EQUALITY

PROFESSOR PAOLA
SEVERINO

AMBASSADOR
MELANNE VERVEER

Special Representative
of the OSCE
Chairperson-inOffice on Combating
Corruption

Special Representative
of the OSCE
Chairperson-in-Office
on Gender

Having been entrusted, for the third consecutive year,
with the mandate of Special Representative of the OSCE
Chairperson-in-Office on Combating Corruption, Professor
Severino supported the Albanian Chairmanship in setting
the fight against corruption as one of the Chairmanship’s
key priorities. Within her mandate, Professor Severino
actively promoted OSCE principles and commitments by
calling on and encouraging governments and international
organizations to intensify their anti-corruption efforts, and
also by strengthening the OSCE “acquis” in this domain
and providing adequate funding to relevant extrabudgetary
projects.
On the occasion of her participation in high-level OSCE
events and field visits – among them a regional seminar in
North Macedonia in February 2020, the OSCE high-level
conference against corruption in July 2020, the Economic
and Environmental Forum in Prague in September 2020
and a round-table discussion in Tirana in November 2020
with the participation of Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs
Luigi Di Maio and Albanian Minister of Justice Etilda
Gjonaj – Professor Severino reaffirmed the need
to support innovation, increased transparency and
digitalization in the OSCE region as the most effective
measures to enhance the resilience of public governance
in the OSCE participating States.
With the region facing the COVID-19 crisis, Professor
Severino urged the OSCE participating States to promote
a participatory approach among parliament, government,
civil society, youth, the business community and media
to foster citizens’ trust and social consensus on rejecting
corruption and establishing a new social compact based
on a culture of integrity and collective responsibility.

The Special Representative of the OSCE Chairpersonin-Office on Gender, Ambassador Melanne Verveer
addressed a joint meeting of the Forum for Security Cooperation and the Permanent Council where she urged the
Organization to adopt more inclusive approaches to move
the prospects for peace forward in protracted conflicts
by involving civil society and community peacebuilders.
She spoke at a special session of the Permanent Council
on the elimination of sexual violence in conflict and
joined Amb. Hasani to mark the International Day for the
Elimination of Violence against Women, recognizing that
violence has increased at alarming rates due to COVID-19.
She spoke at the Permanent Council session to mark the
20th anniversary of UN Security Council Resolution 1325
and addressed the Gender Equality Review Conference,
underscoring the need to accelerate progress on
commitments undertaken in previous Ministerial Council
decisions. She also joined ODIHR as the keynote speaker
for its round table on promoting women’s participation and
leadership in political parties.
Ambassador Verveer met with the Women’s Platform –
regional peacebuilders – in May to discuss the impact
of COVID-19 on conflict resolution efforts. She also took
part in an OSCE-sponsored meeting with peacebuilders
in Ukraine one year after her official country visit to the
country. In November 2020, Ambassador Verveer joined
the OSCE Mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina for its
conference on the 20th anniversary of UN Security Council
Resolution 1325, where she offered reflections on her
previous country visits to Bosnia and Herzegovina.

THREE PERSONAL REPRESENTATIVES OF THE OSCE CHAIRPERSON-IN-OFFICE
ON TOLERANCE AND NON-DISCRIMINATION

RABBI ANDREW BAKER
Personal Representative of the
OSCE Chairperson-in-Office on
Combating Anti-Semitism

AMBASSADOR MEHMET PAÇACI ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR
REGINA POLAK
Personal Representative of the
OSCE Chairperson-in-Office
on Combating Intolerance and
Discrimination against Muslims

The promotion of tolerance and non-discrimination
was a priority of the Albanian OSCE Chairmanship.
On 3–4 February 2020, the Chairmanship hosted the
“Conference on Combating Anti-Semitism in the OSCE
Region” in Tirana, which was attended by the three
Personal Representatives. The event brought together
civil society leaders and experts, representatives of
participating States, ODIHR, the OSCE Parliamentary
Assembly, the European Union and the United Nations. It
enumerated the considerable challenges of providing for
Jewish community security, addressing the proliferation
of anti-Semitism in cyberspace, advancing the use and
adoption of the International Holocaust Remembrance
Alliance‘s Working Definition of Antisemitism, and
protecting the right of religious practices, such as male
circumcision, that are important to both Jews and Muslims.
As most of the Personal Representatives’ plans for
country and other visits in 2020 were cancelled due to
the COVID-19 pandemic, their work moved online as of
spring 2020. Ambassador Mehmet Paçacı’s planned visit
to Norway was replaced by a series of online consultations
with Norwegian officials.
The three Personal Representatives spoke at a number
of online conferences, including the “Supplementary
Human Dimension Meeting on Addressing All Forms of
Intolerance and Discrimination”, held on 25–26 May 2020,
and a webinar called “Addressing Racism, Xenophobia
and Intolerance and Discrimination in the OSCE Area,
with a Focus on Youth”, held on 30 September 2020. In
his interventions, Ambassador Paçacı drew attention to
rising anti-Muslim incidents, intolerance and discrimination,
especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. The
undeniable increase in cases of anti-Muslim intolerance
and discrimination in the OSCE region was a common
concern voiced by many NGO representatives, reports
by international organizations and ODIHR, as well as
in international print outlets and on social media. The
speakers also shared good practices: for instance, a court
that ended an initiative banning Muslim students’ wearing
of the hijab and thus denying their freedom of religion or
belief, and a project that highlighted the contributions of

Personal Representative of the OSCE
Chairperson-in-Office on Combating
Racism, Xenophobia and Discrimination,
also focusing on Intolerance and
Discrimination against Christians and
Members of Other Religions

Muslims to society to challenge the stereotypes people
might have about Muslims.
Against the background of the coronavirus pandemic,
Associate Professor Regina Polak, the Personal
Representative of the OSCE Chairperson-in-Office on
Combating Racism, Xenophobia and Discrimination,
also focusing on Intolerance and Discrimination against
Christians and Members of Other Religions, drew attention
to an increase in intolerance against and discrimination
of persons, groups and minorities – be it on the grounds
of gender, ethnic, cultural or religious background; or any
other status – and the dangers of scapegoating. She called
for state-provided visions and narratives of inclusion, and
enhanced co-operation with civil society to highlight and
strengthen positive models of dialogue, encounters and
cultures of conviviality that already exist in the OSCE area.
These models, she stressed, must be accompanied by
education and should be based on more empirical research.
“As our method of working shifted to the virtual world, the
purveyors of anti-Semitism and other forms of hate moved
there as well. Looking to 2021 and an eventual return to
some normalcy, we will again confront all the challenges
presented at the ‘Tirana Conference on Combating
Anti-Semitism in the OSCE Region’.”
Rabbi Andrew Baker

“Under the extraordinary conditions caused by the
COVID-19 pandemic, incidents of anti-Muslim hatred,
discrimination and intolerance, which had also been on the
rise in previous years, appear to have increased further.”
Ambassador Mehmet Paçacı

“Especially in the aftermath of the COVID-19 crisis, which
fuelled the proliferation of intolerance and discrimination of
persons, groups and minorities throughout the whole OSCE
region, people need orientation and future prospects. We
need to create strong visions of community and positive
narratives on what inclusive societies can look like.”
Associate Professor Regina Polak

ASSISTANCE WITH BILATERAL
AGREEMENTS

LEGAL FRAMEWORK
AMBASSADOR
HELMUT TICHY

DR. VOLKER
FROBARTH

Chairperson of the
Informal Working Group
on Strengthening the
Legal Framework of the
OSCE

OSCE Representative
to the Russian-Latvian
Joint Commission on
Military Pensioners
The Representative continued to assist with the
implementation of the 1994 bilateral agreement between
the governments of Latvia and the Russian Federation on
social guarantees for military pensioners from the Russian
Federation and their families residing in Latvia. Some
5,994 people currently fall under the special provisions of
the agreement.
The average age of the military pensioners has reached
80, thus making the subjects of the bilateral agreement
especially vulnerable to the COVID-19 pandemic. However,
no COVID-19 cases among the military pensioners were
reported.
No individual complaints by military pensioners were
submitted in 2020, continuing the trend of previous years.
The nature of issues considered by the Commission
has shifted from individual cases to matters concerning
the framework for providing services according to the
specifications of the bilateral agreement. The 2020 report
to the Permanent Council concluded that the function
of the Representative should continue as a standby
arrangement.

The Chairmanship appointed Ambassador Helmut Tichy
as Chairperson of the open-ended Informal Working
Group on Strengthening the Legal Framework of the
OSCE. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the meeting of the
Informal Working Group scheduled for May was cancelled.
The meeting in October was held in a blended format and
featured a presentation by the editors of the book The
Legal Framework of the OSCE, published by Cambridge
University Press. The presentation provided input on
the legal issues at hand from an academic point of view
and allowed for a lively exchange between delegations,
the Secretariat and academic experts. Furthermore, the
meeting again focused on finding a solution that would
grant international legal personality to the OSCE, in
accordance with one of four options that had emerged
during the discussions in previous years. The Secretariat
also provided delegations with valuable updates on the
operational consequences of the lack of a clear legal
status for the OSCE.

YOUTH AND SECURITY
MS. KEISI SEFERI
Special Representative
of the Chairperson-inOffice on Youth and
Security

The Special Representative on Youth and Security devoted
her work to keeping youth high on the OSCE agenda,
and advocated for the meaningful and active participation
of young people in the work of the Organization and
across the three dimensions of comprehensive security.
In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Special
Representative’s advocacy for the right of young women
and men to be included in all aspects of political, social
and economic processes resulted in the promotion of
several online events showcasing the role of young people
in peace and security, such as a series of webinars
organized with the Office of the Secretary General and
the conference “Advancing Political Participation of
Young People across the OSCE Region”, organized in
co-operation with ODIHR on 16 December.
Further, the Special Representative prioritized the
promotion of platforms for intergenerational dialogue within

the OSCE to raise awareness about the role of young
people in responding to unprecedented challenges in an
innovative manner by using technologies and eliminating
barriers to connecting with one another. In particular, she
promoted a narrative on the transformative potential of the
agendas on youth, peace and security and on women,
peace and security.
On the margins of the 27th OSCE Ministerial Council
in Tirana, the Special Representative engaged in highlevel discussions on the historical role young people have
played in the transition to democracy in the OSCE region,
and highlighted their contribution to building more inclusive
societies and fostering social cohesion.
Throughout the year, the Special Representative on
Youth and Security took part in over 20 OSCE and
external initiatives, including consultation meetings
across the OSCE area, and engaged with participating
States and OSCE executive structures, international
organizations, academia and civil society practitioners.
She supported the OSCE Secretariat Perspectives 2030
Initiative, which provides a platform for young women
and men to discuss with decision-makers their vision of
a safer future for the OSCE area in 2030 and beyond.
In this spirit, she fully supported the Chairmanship’s
activities, initiatives and objectives on youth and
security.

PARTNERS FOR CO-OPERATION
The OSCE maintains special relations with five Asian and six Mediterranean Partners for Co-operation to address shared
security challenges. The Albanian OSCE Chairmanship continued to promote ongoing dialogue and joint activities with the
Partners for Co-operation with support from the outgoing Slovak and incoming Swedish OSCE Chairmanships.

During its Chairmanship of the Asian Partnership for
Co-operation Group in 2020, Slovakia focused on promoting
and strengthening an open and interactive dialogue. In
elaborating the agenda of the Asian Partnership for
Co-operation Group, Slovakia worked with the Albanian
OSCE Chairmanship and, in particular, the Asian Partners
to ensure that the agenda also reflected their priorities and
followed a demand-driven approach. The collaboration
not only ensured that the agenda corresponded to the
interests and concerns of the Asian Partner countries but
also supported the priorities of the OSCE Chairmanship and
built on the Ministerial Council decision adopted in Bratislava
in 2019 that renamed the Contact Group with the Asian
Partners for Co-operation the OSCE Asian Partners for
Co-operation Group.
In 2020, due to COVID-19 restrictions, all five meetings of
the Asian Partnership for Co-operation Group were held
virtually; nonetheless, the OSCE participating States and
Asian Partners were able to engage in timely discussions of
key security issues of interest to all sides and to share best
practices and experiences with one another. Each meeting
featured speakers from one of the Asian Partner countries,
as well as presentations on the chosen topics by experts
from international organizations, diplomats, academia and
civil society. They included discussions on the OSCE’s
commitment to the conflict cycle; good governance and the
fight against corruption; connectivity and trade facilitation;
women, peace and security; and challenges of emerging
technologies and cybersecurity.

CHAIRMANSHIP

2020 OSCE ASIAN CONFERENCE
The 2020 OSCE Asian Conference, focusing on multilateral
responses to global security challenges, took place on
12–13 October via Zoom. The Conference was organized
in partnership with the Republic of Korea and was originally
scheduled to take place in Seoul. All five Asian Partners for
Co-operation and 30 OSCE participating States attended.
More than 150 political representatives and policy experts,
as well as practitioners from international, regional and
subregional organizations, academia, business and civil
society from across the OSCE’s participating States and
Asian Partners for Co-operation, gathered to explore ways
of tackling global security challenges in the three dimensions
of security. During the high-level opening session, speakers
reconfirmed that security in the OSCE area was inextricably
linked to that of other regions, that it could be strengthened
by better mutual understanding and that the international
community had to work together on a global scale. The
opening was followed by three thematic sessions dedicated
to the OSCE’s three dimensions with a focus on regional
confidence- and security-building measures and exchanges
of best practices between Europe and Asia, the mitigation
of transborder environmental risks and challenges and the
nexus between security and access to information in the
context of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Chairmanship: Sweden

3 November 2020. (Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Sweden)

In the spirit of growing co-operation and genuine partnership,
the 2019 OSCE Ministerial Council in Bratislava renamed
the Mediterranean Contact Group the OSCE Mediterranean
Partners for Co-operation Group. Following up on one of the
proposals advanced on the occasion of the 25th anniversary
of the Mediterranean Partnership in 2019, the 2020 Albanian
Chairmanship dedicated a Permanent Council meeting on
12 November 2020 to a review of co-operation with the
Mediterranean Partners.
Sweden, as the Chair of the Mediterranean Partners for
Co-operation Group, promoted a dynamic, interactive and
operational OSCE Mediterranean Partnership during 2020.
The focus was placed on increasing security in the OSCE
region, including by leveraging the full potential of closer
dialogue and co-operation with the Mediterranean Partners.
Despite the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic,
Sweden managed to organize three meetings of the
Mediterranean Partners for Co-operation Group during
the year. The meetings promoted dialogue with the
Mediterranean Partners for Co-operation on a range of
crucial topics with a view to intensifying the exchange of best
practices and identifying areas for long-term co-operation.
Topics included information technology and the fight against
human trafficking; women, peace, and security; and youth
engagement and participation to counter violent extremism
and radicalization that lead to terrorism.
In addition, representatives of the Mediterranean Partners for
Co-operation were involved in a range of additional OSCE
conferences and events. On 17 February 2020, an Arabic
version of the OSCE handbook Understanding the Role of
Gender in Preventing and Countering Violent Extremism and
Radicalization That Lead to Terrorism: Good Practices for Law
Enforcement was launched in Cairo thanks to co-operation
between the OSCE Transnational Threats Department

20

and the League of Arab States. On 5 October 2020, the
OSCE Chairmanship organized an OSCE-wide conference
called “Addressing Organized Crime through Strategic
Partnerships”, which was designed by the Strategic Police
Matters Unit. A plurality of participating States and partner
countries offered an overview of their respective challenges
and recognized the need for an inclusive regional approach in
addressing them.
The Partnership Fund supported a number of activities in
2020, including projects addressing human trafficking in the
context of Mediterranean migration movements and tackling
the challenge posed by trafficking in cultural property. The
Partnership Fund continued to support activities in the field of
youth engagement and women’s empowerment.

2020 OSCE MEDITERRANEAN CONFERENCE
The Mediterranean Conference, held on 3 November 2020,
provided a high-level political platform for advancing the
Mediterranean Partnership and for discussing security
developments in the OSCE and Mediterranean regions,
also in light of the security implications of the pandemic.
Titled “Promoting Security in the OSCE Mediterranean
Region through Sustainable Development and Economic
Growth”, the conference was a full-day event with more
than 250 participants from over 60 countries. The highlevel political session was attended by a total of 16 ministers
and deputy ministers from Partners for Co-operation
and participating States, confirming the Mediterranean
Conference as a ministerial-level forum for regional dialogue.
Two afternoon thematic sessions were held, focusing on
women’s economic participation and on co-operation in
environmental issues. Several delegations put forward
specific proposals for the future of the Partnership and a
move towards a more secure, peaceful and prosperous
future – for the benefit of all.

The weekly meetings of the Permanent Council throughout
the 2020 Albanian OSCE Chairmanship were chaired by
Albania’s Permanent Representative to the International
Organizations in Vienna, Ambassador Igli Hasani. Despite
the unprecedented situation created by the pandemic
and two lockdowns that caused serious obstacles for the
normal continuity of the Organization’s work, the Albanian
Chairmanship managed to hold 44 sessions of the
Permanent Council, including nine special sessions.
The weekly meetings of the Permanent Council serve as
the main platform for dialogue, debates, consultations,
the exchange of ideas and decision-making not only on
recurring issues on the OSCE agenda but also in matters
related to Chairmanship priorities and to unpredicted
developments in the OSCE area. Throughout the year,
Ambassador Hasani welcomed distinguished guest
speakers to the Permanent Council, including foreign
ministers and deputy ministers from the participating
States and high-level representatives from international
organizations.
Whether in the traditional format at the Hofburg, a
blended format or entirely online, the guest speakers
in the Permanent Council highlighted issues of special
relevance to the Chairmanship, such as monitoring the
situation in and around Ukraine; reinforcing the OSCE’s
engagement in conflict resolution, including strengthening
the role and efforts of all OSCE field operations; promoting
gender equality and the role of youth in peace and
security; establishing better co-operation and partnerships
in preventing and countering violent extremism and
radicalization leading to terrorism; promoting good
governance and combating corruption; combating human
trafficking; and strengthening joint engagements for the
full respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms
including by promoting freedom of expression, tolerance
and non-discrimination.
The Special Representative of the Chairperson-inOffice in Ukraine and in the Trilateral Contact Group,
Ambassador Heidi Grau, and the Chief Monitor of
the SMM, Ambassador Halit Çevik, addressed the
Permanent Council six times regarding the crisis in and
around Ukraine alone. The Chairperson also called
special meetings in response to the developments and
unrest following the presidential election in Belarus
or to hear the Personal Representative of the OSCE

22

Chairperson-in-Office on the conflict dealt with by the
OSCE Minsk Conference on the developments in the
Nagorno-Karabakh conflict context. The meetings of
the Permanent Council provided an opportunity to
foster close, mutually beneficial co-operation with other
international organizations active in the OSCE area
through the participation of high-level representatives
such as the Secretary General of the CoE, an Assistant
Secretary-General of the United Nations, European Union
representatives, the Executive Director of the United
Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) and the
President of the ICRC.

“Being small isn’t necessarily a disadvantage. If one
works hard enough and plays to one’s strengths,
anything is possible. The Tirana Ministerial went
above and beyond expectations, even for me and
Chairperson Rama. If there is one lesson learned, it is
that achievements became possible for no other reason
than sheer hard work, grit and determination. Albania
didn’t have the diplomatic firepower or experience of
others before us. But we made up for that with our work
ethic and team spirit, and kept going despite everything
2020 threw at us, all of us. Consensus is never taken
for granted, until the very end. So we thank the
participating States for working with us for consensus
and for lending their support.”

FORUM FOR
SECURITY
CO-OPERATION
The Forum for Security Co-operation (FSC) is the OSCE’s
key decision-making body on politico-military aspects of
security. Its participants meet weekly in Vienna to discuss
issues such as arms control and confidence- and securitybuilding measures. The Forum Chairmanship rotates
among the OSCE participating States, with each state
chairing the FSC for four months. In 2020, the FSC was
chaired by Turkey, Ukraine and Germany.

Security
Co-operation

www.osce.org/forum-for-security-cooperation

The year 2020 was an extraordinary one on account of COVID-19, and it tested the
FSC’s ability to conduct its work. In their immediate responses to the crisis, the FSC
Chairmanships, in close co-ordination with the Chairmanship of the Permanent Council
and the OSCE Secretariat, maintained continuity in the FSC’s work while following the
host country’s preventive measures and prioritizing duty of care for personnel.
In the course of the last year, the strategic discussions during the Security Dialogues
indicated the FSC’s importance as a platform for dialogue, addressing security issues
of common interest and concern. Although the topic regularly raised by Ukraine,
involving active participation on the part of interested delegations, continued to
dominate the Forum’s discussions, there were a variety of other active discussions on
the following themes: normative and project-related aspects in the field of small arms
and light weapons (SALW) and stockpiles of conventional ammunition (SCA), including
the topic of mine action; regional and subregional military and defence co-operation;
the implementation of the women, peace and security agenda; the OSCE Code of
Conduct on Politico-Military Aspects of Security, including private military and security
companies; implementation of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1540 (2004);
the Vienna Document 2011 and confidence- and security-building measures (CSBMs);
matters related to terrorism; new technologies; and COVID-19 and its impact on
politico-military aspects of security in the OSCE area, including the implementation of
CSBMs. The three 2020 FSC Chairmanships organized a total of 21 Security Dialogues.
Several initiatives undertaken by participating States led to the adoption of eight
decisions, all designed to support the implementation of existing commitments.

By closely following the prevailing developments of the
COVID-19 situation, the FSC Chairmanships provided
guidance on modalities of the FSC’s work. With the
support of the OSCE Secretariat, the FSC meetings,
those of the Working Groups and informal meetings
were conducted either in a blended format or remotely
via teleconference, starting with the Ukrainian FSC
Chairmanship. The Turkish FSC Chairmanship issued
a letter appealing to all participating States, within their
sovereign rights, to refrain from or postpone verification
activities under the auspices of the Vienna Document
2011 whenever possible, until it was determined that
the prevailing conditions allowed such activities to take
place safely again. In addition, the FSC Chairmanship
invited the participating States to conduct the annual
Global Exchange of Military Information electronically.
Furthermore, the German FSC Chairmanship issued a
letter inviting the participating States to carry out the 2020
annual exchange of military information electronically via
the OSCE Communications Network.
Three of the Security Dialogues and many informal
meetings were devoted to SALW/SCA, as tasked by the
relevant OSCE documents and various relevant FSC
and Ministerial Council decisions. Two of the Security
Dialogues featured discussions on OSCE work in mine
action. Moreover, the dedicated work on updating the

26

best practice guides on SALW and conventional arms
continued throughout the year, and the second “OSCE
Biennial Meeting to Assess the Implementation of the
OSCE Documents on Small Arms and Light Weapons and
Stockpiles of Conventional Ammunition” – as decided at
the 2017 Ministerial Council – was held under the German
FSC Chairmanship in October 2020.

OSCE ANNUAL REPORT 2020

-----------------------Page 28 End-----------------------

Two Security Dialogues were held with a view to
promoting regional stability and adhering to the principles
and norms of the OSCE and international law. The one
held under Ukraine’s FSC Chairmanship concerned the
security situation in the Black Sea and Sea of Azov region;
the other one, held under the Chairmanship of Turkey,
focused on regional security co-operation in countering
irregular migration.
Another topic highlighted during the year was the nonproliferation of weapons of mass destruction and United
Nations Security Council Resolution 1540, to which
one Security Dialogue was devoted under Turkey’s FSC
Chairmanship and another under the Chairmanship of
Ukraine.
During Turkey’s FSC Chairmanship, instead of sending –
as would normally be the case under the FSC’s
Announcing and Reminding Mechanism – a reminder
letter to the participating States that had not provided
information pursuant to the Vienna Document, the
Chairperson individually approached officials from these
states in order to expedite the process.
The 30th Annual Implementation Assessment Meeting
(AIAM) took place in March 2020 during Turkey’s FSC
Chairmanship. Led by Malta and Moldova, the meeting
provided an opportunity to raise and discuss various
issues related to the present and future implementation
of agreed CSBMs.
The ninth Annual Discussion on the Implementation
of the Code of Conduct on Politico-Military Aspects
of Security was held online in June 2020 under the
Ukrainian FSC Chairmanship. The meeting provided a

valuable opportunity for participating States to review the
enforcement of the Code and to exchange views on ways
to improve its implementation.
The FSC also contributed to the 2020 Annual Security Review
Conference within its mandate, providing input to relevant
sessions focusing on politico-military elements of security.
The year 2020 marked the 20th anniversary of the
landmark UNSCR 1325. The FSC Chairmanships devoted
a total of three Security Dialogues to gender equality.
With 2020 being a year of commemoration, Turkey
dedicated one Security Dialogue to the 20th anniversary of
the OSCE Istanbul Summit, using it to look at the lessons
of the Summit, described as a “bridge-builder to the
21st century”, and to discuss contributions to the FSC’s
agenda.
All three FSC Chairmanships co-operated closely with
the Albanian OSCE Chairmanship-in-Office and the
OSCE Permanent Council on cross-dimensional issues of
relevance to both bodies. To this end, four joint meetings
of the Forum for Security Co-operation and Permanent
Council were held, on the Structured Dialogue, on
countering terrorism, on UNSCR 1325, and on hybrid
threats and modern warfare.
The FSC continued in 2020 to serve as an important
platform for dialogue and decisions, while at the same
time providing participating States with a forum to
discuss matters related to politico-military issues. Despite
COVID-19, the FSC proved successful in taking measures
to adapt to the current situation and in keeping up with its
regular work under the challenging circumstances.

Parliamentary
Assembly

Secretary General: Roberto Montella
Budget: €3,643,000
Staff: 32 (including 8 research assistants)
www.oscepa.org

With members of the Ad Hoc Committee on Countering Terrorism visiting Norway in
January, the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly (PA) started 2020 with an ambitious agenda
of activities that soon had to adapt to the realities of life under the COVID-19 pandemic.
Before the lockdown in the spring, PA members observed parliamentary elections in
Azerbaijan, conducted diplomatic visits to the United States and Greece, and participated
in the PA’s annual Winter Meeting in Vienna.
In mid-March, the OSCE PA International Secretariat began working remotely and soon
started making announcements of cancelled meetings and the suspension of activities
such as election observation. The leadership met virtually to consider options, decided
unanimously to freeze the budget and reduce national contributions for the current year,
and the PA launched a series of thematic Parliamentary Web Dialogues dealing with
various aspects of the pandemic. Assembly leaders also authored several op-eds on
COVID-related themes, such as the role of multilateralism and parliaments, the economic
impact of the pandemic and the importance of upholding human rights under lockdowns.
COVID-19 PARLIAMENTARY WEB DIALOGUES
The first of the Parliamentary Web Dialogues was held
on 22 April 2020 on the economic security fallout of
the pandemic. Featuring speakers from academia,
government, the financial sector and the international
community, the webinar focused on promoting ambitious
government programmes to stimulate the economy.
Subsequent webinars were held on the pandemic’s
effects on conflicts in the OSCE area, human rights and
democratic governance, counter-terrorism, gender issues,
environmental aspects of the pandemic, the protection
of refugees and migrants under lockdowns and the
COVID-19 response in diverse societies.
An overriding theme of the Parliamentary Web Dialogues
was that parliamentarians play an essential role in
promoting good governance and enhancing dialogue
on the international level. Participants also stressed that
the pandemic has underlined the urgency of addressing
long-standing challenges facing the OSCE area, including
resolving conflicts, promoting environmental sustainability,
managing migration, and ensuring democratic resiliency
and social cohesion.
The highlights of the Parliamentary Web Dialogues were
included in a report published in mid-July entitled “OSCE
PA vs COVID-19: Reflections, policy contributions and
recommendations presented by OSCE PA President
George Tsereteli.”
PARLIAMENTARY DIPLOMACY

UN’s Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy. Tsereteli and
Montella also visited Washington, DC, in early February,
meeting with members of Congress, officials from
the State Department and staff from the US Helsinki
Commission.
During the pandemic, the PA turned to digital diplomacy.
The PA Bureau held an online discussion with Belarusian
Head of Delegation Andrei Savinykh and exiled
Belarusian opposition presidential candidate Sviatlana
Tsikhanouskaya that focused on the importance of
building dialogue in the wake of the disputed presidential
election of 9 August 2020. Members of the OSCE PA’s
Ad Hoc Committee on Migration also met online with
European Commission representatives and Greek
Migration and Asylum Minister Notis Mitarachi to discuss
the upcoming EU Migration and Asylum Pact and the
situation on Lesbos following the fires that destroyed the
Moria camp in early September.
When fighting broke out in the Nagorno-Karabakh
conflict zone, President Tsereteli was in regular contact
with parliamentarians from Armenia and Azerbaijan,
including both countries’ speakers of parliament. In these
discussions, Tsereteli urged a ceasefire and return to
negotiations based on international law and principles of
the OSCE Helsinki Final Act.
ASSEMBLY ENGAGEMENT ON
STRENGTHENING THE OSCE
The PA responded to the leadership vacuum created
by the lack of consensus on the reappointment of the
OSCE Secretary General and the other OSCE heads of
institutions in July with a number of initiatives, including
a call for action signed by some 50 current and former
leaders of the OSCE, an open letter to OSCE foreign
ministers and a brainstorming discussion held on
7–8 September in Helsingor, Denmark. Several OSCE
experts participated in the Helsingor retreat, which
served as an opportunity to explore ways in which
the Parliamentary Assembly could better support the
Organization and thereby also help overcome some
institutional stalemates.

CONTRIBUTING POLITICAL EXPERIENCE TO
OSCE ELECTION OBSERVATION
OSCE PA election observers contributed their political
experience, judgement and visibility to this essential
OSCE endeavour, working closely with ODIHR and
other international partners. The OSCE PA deployed
141 observers to four countries in 2020: Azerbaijan,
Georgia, Montenegro and the United States of America.

The Office of the Secretary General (OSG) is a provider of central services, a manager of
programmes and a policy adviser for the OSCE Chairmanship and the Secretary General,
including in his or her role as the OSCE’s Chief Administrative Officer. In response
to the unprecedented situation created by the coronavirus, the Crisis Management
Team, chaired by the Director of the Office of the Secretary General, supported the
development and communication of a responsible and consistent approach to the
pandemic, prioritizing the protection of OSCE staff while ensuring business continuity.

UPHOLDING CRITICAL OPERATIONS
A number of functions performed by the Office of the
Secretary General and Central Services were critical to
maintaining business continuity during the pandemic.
Conference and Language Services quickly adjusted to
the challenges of social distancing by adopting online
technologies to enable the OSCE decision-making bodies
to meet. Starting in April, and under the guidance of their
respective Chairmanships, the Permanent Council and the
Forum for Security Co-operation were running online –
with simultaneous interpretation in all six official OSCE
languages.
Security Management played a key part in the OSCE’s
early-warning system, continuously providing updates and
recommendations on preventive measures as situations
evolved.
With support from Executive Management, the Secretary
General managed the overall response to the pandemic,
and under the guidance of the Albanian Chair, informed
participating States about contingency planning and dutyof-care responsibilities.
The Office of Legal Affairs dealt with a number of complex
queries from the OSCE Chairmanship, participating States
and executive structures that involved deviations from
established practice due to the exceptional circumstances.

“On the one hand, we miss the in-person negotiations
and diplomacy, but, on the other hand, working remotely
has brought some benefits. Teleworking has notably
sped up communication with the OSCE Documentation
Centre in Prague. Instant online availability has also
meant that exchanges with ODIHR in Warsaw, the High
Commissioner on National Minorities in The Hague and
the Representative on Freedom of the Media and the
Secretariat in Vienna have become more frequent.”

“Like most parents, I found working from home
really hard during the lockdown phases. Supervising
home schooling, preparing extra meals and providing
recreational outlets for my children meant that
the interruptions were constant. The Organization
implemented gender-sensitive practices for remote
working, which were based on recommendations
provided by the Human Resources Department and the
Gender Issues Programme, and were really helpful. What
also made teleworking easier was the team. We were
probably closer than ever, supporting each other at all
times.”

Mersiha Causevic Podzic
Communications and Media Relations Section

Communications and Media Relations quickly set up
a COVID-19 portal on the OSCE website to provide
information and share stories from the field on the OSCE’s
support to the participating States. The visiting groups
programme was also moved online.
External Co-operation intensified its contacts with other
organizations to share information on responses to the
COVID-19 crisis. This helped leverage the capacities of
each organization and enabled effective co-ordination of
human resource policies and substantive responses –
for example, on medical evacuation from affected regions.
The OSCE Documentation Centre in Prague moved its
outreach and education activities online, including a
unique exhibition on the Paris Summit and the Charter
of Paris for a New Europe on the occasion of its
30th anniversary. Despite the difficult travel conditions,
researchers from seven participating States came to
study the Centre’s archives. They were supported by the
Centre’s staff while all safety measures were applied.

ADDRESSING NEW SECURITY CHALLENGES
CREATED BY THE PANDEMIC
Beyond their focus on the Organization’s functional
capabilities in times of crisis, sections of the OSG also
provided analyses of the coronavirus’s implications for
comprehensive security across the OSCE region. The
Office consistently advocated for OSCE participating
States to adopt an inclusive and gender-responsive
approach to the COVID-19 response and recovery by
addressing the specific needs of women and men as well
as young people.
The Gender Issues Programme immediately responded
to reports of rising rates of domestic violence throughout
the OSCE region at the onset of lockdowns by tackling
the disproportionate impact that the pandemic has had on
women. In co-operation with the OSG Adviser on Youth
and Security, the Gender Issues Programme also promoted
intergenerational discussions on the specific needs and
potential contributions of youth in the current crisis.

The Conflict Prevention Centre (CPC) is the main point of contact on matters concerning
OSCE field operations. It addresses all phases of the conflict cycle by providing policy
and operational guidance and advice, including through early warning and support of the
OSCE’s response in crisis situations and through efforts to find lasting political settlements
for existing conflicts. The CPC is also a core structure of OSCE work in the politico-military
dimension and provides Organization-wide support for project management.

ACTIVITIES IN SUPPORT OF CONFLICT
RESOLUTION
The CPC continued its role in co-ordination of the OSCE
response to the crisis in and around Ukraine, including
by supporting efforts to stabilize the security situation
and foster implementation of the Minsk agreements. In
2020, much of its support to the the Special Monitoring
Mission to Ukraine focused on balancing the duty of
care in relation to mission members with continued
delivery of its mandated tasks. The CPC further assisted
the Trilateral Contact Group with the aim of supporting
and consolidating the ceasefire from late July 2020 and
supporting efforts to build on the ceasefire. In addition,
it supported the work of the OSCE Project Co-ordinator
in Ukraine and the Observer Mission at the Russian
Checkpoints Gukovo and Donetsk.
Following the resurgence of open conflict in and around
Nagorno-Karabakh in September 2020, the CPC stepped
up its support with increased information-sharing and
communication, in particular with the Albanian Chair, the
Personal Representative of the Chairperson-in-Office on
the conflict dealt with by the OSCE Minsk Conference, as
well as other elements of the OSCE Minsk Process.
It backed efforts by the OSCE Mission to Moldova and the
Special Representative of the OSCE Chairperson-in-Office
HELPING CONFLICT-AFFECTED
COMMUNITIES IN GEORGIA
Through a grant from the OSCE Charity Ball Fund, the
CPC, in co-operation with the municipality of Gori and
the local NGO Zrda, helped to rebuild the destroyed
wing of a kindergarten in the village of Kveshi, near
Ergneti, where the IPRM meetings co-facilitated by
the OSCE take place. The improved and enlarged
building provides a better and safer environment for
about 80 boys and girls, including from surrounding
villages, as well as a venue for community meetings.
On 25 September 2020, Special Representative Rudolf
Michalka joined CPC colleagues for the official opening,
and thanked the mayor of Gori and other partners for
their work and engagement in this isolated area.

In addition, it supported efforts to reach agreement on
further measures.
The CPC also worked closely with the Special
Representative for the South Caucasus and continued to
contribute to the active involvement of the OSCE in the
IPRM in Ergneti and the Geneva International Discussions
dealing with the consequences of the 2008 war in
Georgia.
SUPPORTING FIELD OPERATIONS IN CENTRAL
ASIA AND SOUTH-EASTERN EUROPE
The CPC supported the work of field operations in Central
Asia and the two regional flagship projects, the OSCE
Academy in Bishkek and the Border Management Staff
College in Dushanbe. It also facilitated steps to enhance
the Academy’s co-operation with field operations and
bolster its regional impact.
On both Central Asia and South-Eastern Europe, the
CPC provided advice to the Chair, the Secretary General
and field operations and facilitated OSCE responses
to developments in the region. In particular, the CPC
invested efforts toward strengthening regional and crossdimensional approaches and co-ordination between
OSCE structures.
RESPONDING TO THE COVID-19 CRISIS
Following the outbreak of the pandemic, the CPC
intensified co-ordination between the Secretariat and
OSCE field operations to support them in ensuring the
safety and welfare of staff, assess the impact of the crisis
on field-operation mandate implementation, facilitate
contingency planning, and share lessons and good
practices in crisis response. It established a working
group that provided tailored responses to the needs of
field operations in accordance with local conditions and
measures taken by host governments. Leveraging the
expertise of the Secretariat, the CPC facilitated responses
to the broad spectrum of issues facing field operations,
including stress management, medical evacuation, remote
working and ICT challenges.

The OSCE Academy in Bishkek serves and is
developing a new generation of young professionals
in Central Asia, Afghanistan, Mongolia and across the
OSCE region. The CPC Central Asia Desk supports the
Academy by providing policy advice, raising awareness
of its activities and encouraging further support from
participating States.
The CPC hosts an Academy intern each year, and
this year welcomed Ms. Alimana Zhanmukanova, an
MA in Politics and Security student from Kazakhstan,
although the pandemic meant her internship with the
Central Asia Desk was conducted remotely. “The CPC
provided me with comprehensive professional training
on working in a diplomatic, international and political
sphere. I was involved on the same level as its staff
members, providing me with the opportunity for both
professional and personal growth. This internship
was the best experience of my MA Programme at the
Academy”, Alimana commented.

EARLY WARNING
The CPC promotes a structured and systematic approach
to early warning across the Organization through the
Network of Early Warning Focal Points in field operations
and other executive structures. In 2020, it organized the
Network’s ninth annual meeting in a blended format,

The Regional Housing Programme (RHP) addresses
the plight of refugees that followed the dissolution of
the former Yugoslavia. The OSCE, with the UNHCR
and the EU, supported the negotiations that led to a
political agreement between Bosnia and Herzegovina,
Croatia, Montenegro and Serbia to jointly close the
refugee file in the region and develop the RHP. By
the end of August 2020, more than 7,500 vulnerable
refugee or internally displaced families (around
22,500 people) had received a housing solution.
The war had a devastating effect on every family
selected for assistance, since their original properties
were destroyed, and they were forced to leave their
homes. The OSCE works closely with the four partner
countries and other RHP stakeholders to support the
beneficiaries as they begin a new and dignified life.
Beneficiaries come from the most vulnerable groups of
displaced persons from the four countries.

online conflict analysis workshops, alongside regional
meetings and events focused on the OSCE’s conflict cycle
toolbox.

MEDIATION SUPPORT
The Mediation Support Team (MST) is the main resource for mediation and dialogue
facilitation support within the OSCE. In this role, it provided thematic advice and operational
support to OSCE participants in negotiation and conflict management formats, such as the
Trilateral Contact Group on Ukraine, the Transdniestrian settlement process and the Geneva
International Discussions, including strategic retreats for incoming special representatives
and their teams. The MST shared operational guidance on the implications of COVID-19 for
peace process design and the use of digital tools for mediation. In addition, it organized
tailored workshops for field operations on mediation and dialogue facilitation. In cooperation with the Gender Section and field operations, it advanced implementation of
the publication Inclusion of Women and Effective Peace Processes: A Toolkit, including by
disseminating a Russian-language version.

CPC PESU analysis 2020

In 2020, the CPC set up a network of project practitioners and updated project
templates, including by introducing a gender marker and a section on the project's
contribution to the attainment of the UN's Sustainable Development Goals.

SECURITY SECTOR GOVERNANCE/REFORM
(SSG/R)
The OSCE has a long history of supporting participating
States in strengthening the governance of their security
sectors. This support reflects the Organization’s
comprehensive approach to security and is a tool for
fostering lasting peace and security in the OSCE area.
SSG/R remains a nationally owned process, in which
OSCE support is demand-driven and at the request of
participating States.
In 2020, the CPC continued working towards a more
coherent and co-ordinated approach to SSG/R by
strengthening internal capacities, providing conceptual
and operational support to executive structures and, on
request, building capacities in participating States. For
example, the CPC:

SUPPORTING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF
POLITICO-MILITARY COMMITMENTS
The FSC Support and the Communications and
Technology Units support participating States in
implementing Confidence- and Security-Building
Measures (CSBMs), which cover a wide variety of
instruments to increase peace and stability in Europe.
These include the Vienna Document, addressing military
force postures and activities; documents on Small
Arms and Light Weapons (SALW) and Stockpiles of
Conventional Ammunition (SCA); the Code of Conduct on
Politico-Military Aspects of Security; and the Principles
related to Non-Proliferation on Aspects of Weapons
of Mass Destruction. Under COVID-19 conditions, the
verification of military activities largely came to a standstill
while most of the FSC’s other work was carried out online.
CHEMICAL SAFETY AND SECURITY IN
UKRAINE
The Conflict Prevention Centre and the Project
Co-ordinator in Ukraine, with financial support from the
European Union and the United States of America, have
implemented chemical safety and security projects since
2017. The projects take place under the umbrella of United
Nations Security Council Resolution 1540, which obliges
all states to prevent the proliferation of nuclear, chemical
and biological weapons and their means of delivery.
As part of the project “Strengthening controls over crossboundary movement of controlled and toxic chemicals”,
Ukraine’s State Customs Service and State Border Guard
Service obtained protective equipment to help train staff
in countering chemical threats. Protective suits and masks
were also dispatched to border control points with the
highest risk of COVID-19 infection in an effort to protect
Ukraine’s customs and border authorities against the
coronavirus.

SCHOLARSHIP FOR PEACE AND SECURITY
The annual OSCE Scholarship for Peace and Security
training programme, a joint OSCE–United Nations Office
of Disarmament (UNODA) initiative, encourages young
people, particularly women, to participate in the security
sector. Its third edition provided 150 scholarships to
young professionals, in particular women, to increase their
awareness and understanding of academic, conceptual
and analytical issues in the area of arms control,
disarmament and non-proliferation, with a focus on the
OSCE and its instruments.
Due to COVID-19 travel restrictions, the training course
was held online from April to June 2020. The programme
taught participants’ professional skills, broadened
their perspectives and contributed to creating equal
opportunities for women’s participation in policy-making,
planning and implementation processes in arms control,
disarmament and non-proliferation.
Yuliia, a participant from Ukraine, commented: “I think
the inspiration and networking with fellow females from
the same field largely contributed significantly to my
current success. As mine action is a traditionally maledominated environment, it was so important to know that
there are many successful women in the field, both at the
beginning of their careers and in leadership positions.
Also, the course changed my own initial perception of how
important and relevant gender-related issues are.”
SHARING INFORMATION AMONG
PARTICIPATING STATES
The CPC facilitates the secure exchange of information
between and among participating States – crucial in
building confidence and trust. This includes military
information as well as cyber-related information. The

OSCE Communications Network, established by the 1990
Charter of Paris for a New Europe, is key in facilitating this
dialogue. In the past year, the Communications Network
facilitated the exchange of over 430,000 messages
between participating States.

OSCE BEST PRACTICE GUIDES IN THE AREA
OF SALW AND CONVENTIONAL AMMUNITION
The OSCE’s guides on
SALW and conventional
ammunition (CA) aim to
help prevent their reaching
illicit markets and terrorist
and criminal groups. The
guides complement other
international guidance and
provide participating States
and field operations with
common standards for
weapons and ammunition
controls when implementing assistance projects,
developing legislation and building national capacities.
Participating States launched a review and update
of the guides in late 2019 and continued their
discussions throughout 2020, taking into account
lessons learned from applying the guides at field
operations and in projects. Although the pandemic
affected the pace of the review and update process,
a guide on deactivation of SALW was adopted
to help preventing the reactivation of weapons
and to contribute to combating trafficking.

The OSCE’s Transnational Threats Department (TNTD) supported OSCE participating
States and Partners for Co-operation in their efforts to address transnational threats in
2020. The Department provided assistance in fulfilling political commitments through
effective and sustainable activities such as convening joint expert meetings, sharing
information and best practices, and delivering capacity-building projects. TNTD consists
of a Co-ordination Cell, which also deals with cyber/information and communication
technology (ICTs) security, and three thematic units: the Action against Terrorism Unit, the
Border Security and Management Unit and the Strategic Police Matters Unit.
CYBER/ICT SECURITY
In response to a pandemic unprecedented in modern
times, professional, economic, medical and personal
activities have started migrating to cyberspace at
an ever-faster rate. Unfortunately, the benefits of this
transformation have been mirrored by the growing
scope, number and impact of cyberthreats targeting
both individuals and critical infrastructures. The world
has largely risen to this challenge, and while in-person
activities, especially diplomacy and trust-building, can
never be replaced, proactive and frequent exchanges of
information and best practices on cyber/ICT security have
done much to preserve, and even advance, processes
such as the OSCE cyber confidence-building measures
(CBMs).

SECRETARIAT  n  Transnational threats

TNTD has not only adapted to the emerging situation
but has also found a new digital voice that will outlast
the disruptions caused by COVID-19. TNTD has moved
its trust- and confidence-building activities online, while
increasing their frequency, hosting over a dozen events
in the second half of 2020 alone. The Department
continued to support the network of national policy and
technical Points of Contact as it added new members,
tools, exercises and activities. Numerous lectures and
discussions with leading experts on the topics of critical
infrastructure protection, public–private partnerships and
international cyber exercises were organized. An e-learning

is being developed. Finally, for the first time ever, the
OSCE participated in the global Cybersecurity Awareness
Month in October, organizing a series of webinars aimed
at boosting awareness and improving cyber hygiene
throughout the region.
These kinds of online activities are not just a holdover
until better days return. Rather, they will continue
supplementing TNTD’s in-person events, making
stakeholders more connected, informed, engaged and
secure.
“LIVE FROM THE BORDER” NEW PODCAST
INITIATIVE
The COVID-19 outbreak had disruptive effects on the
freedom of movement of people and goods across
borders, affecting the usual operation of border security
and management agencies in the OSCE area and beyond.
The front-line officers at border checkpoints were the
first to confront this new reality and to face numerous
challenges, from restricted access to border-crossing
for people and goods, to safe communication with
travellers while performing their duties. Furthermore,
front-line officers had to address specific questions and
requests from people wishing to cross borders despite the
restrictive measures.
In a new series of podcasts, TNTD interviewed front-line
officers at borders and experts from the OSCE and other
international organizations in an effort to provide insights
into the operational realities on the ground.
Apart from the topics mentioned earlier, the podcast series
tackles issues such as travel and freedom of movement
under the current exceptional circumstances in an effort to
provide simple answers to difficult questions.
PROMOTING AND SUPPORTING POLICE
EFFORTS FOR GENDER EQUALITY

reducing gender inequality. TNTD has been working
to reinforce the involvement of women in policing and
the capacities of law enforcement and justice actors in
combating gender-based violence.
In June 2020, TNTD concluded a pilot project on
strengthening the capacities of criminal justice
practitioners to combat gender-based violence, reaching
out to more than 15,000 law enforcement and justice
practitioners and 5 million potential victims and bystanders
from Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania. This important
achievement opened the way for the implementation of a
similar project in South-Eastern Europe in partnership with
the OSCE field operations in the region.
At the same time, TNTD launched a project on increasing
and supporting the participation of women at all levels
of policing, with pilot activities starting in Montenegro.
The police should represent the society they serve, but
the underrepresentation of women in the police across
the OSCE area at the strategic, policy and operational
levels continues to be a challenge. TNTD systematically
promotes gender equality within law enforcement by
leveraging its community policing activities and the OSCE
Police Academies Network. The promotion of gender
equality includes mainstreaming a gender perspective
in all activities of the politico-military dimension and
supporting the efforts of law enforcement agencies to
achieve gender equality and thus to contribute to societal
change.
OSCE–UNODC TRAINING PROGRAMME ON
COUNTERING TERRORIST FINANCING
Countering terrorism financing is one of the OSCE’s five main
counter-terrorism commitments, and it is fundamental to a
comprehensive multi-stakeholder approach to addressing
transnational terrorist threats. Since 2017, the OSCE–
UNODC multi-year training programme on countering
terrorist financing has been making an impact on the ground,
leading to institutional reforms, as well as to strengthened
interagency and multi-stakeholder co-operation to uncover
and financially disrupt terrorist networks.
The OSCE–UNODC training programme aims to
increase the capacity of countries to detect and combat

terrorist financing and strengthen compliance with
international standards in this area, such as UN Security
Council resolutions, Financial Action Task Force on
money laundering (FATF) standards, UN norms and
OSCE commitments to promote human rights–based
approaches in countering terrorist financing.

About 200 participants from South-Eastern Europe and
Central Asia have benefited from this training programme
implemented by TNTD in co-operation with the OSCE field
operations. In 2020, nine train-the-trainer and training courses
were organized for Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina,
Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan.

The Office of the Co-ordinator of OSCE Economic and Environmental Activities (OCEEA)
adapted quickly to the challenges posed by the global COVID-19 pandemic. The 28th
OSCE Economic and Environmental Forum (EEF) and the Economic and Environmental
Dimension Implementation Meeting (EEDIM) as well as many programmatic activities
were held in virtual or hybrid formats. In addition, the OCEEA developed a series of
webinars on the pandemic’s impacts on the second dimension.

SUPPORTING ECONOMIC AND
ENVIRONMENTAL SECURITY POLICIES
The EEF, the second dimension’s main policy event,
focused on promoting security, stability and economic
growth in the OSCE area by preventing and combating
corruption through innovation, increased transparency
and digitalization. Discussions prepared the ground for
the “Decision on Preventing and Combating Corruption
through Digitalization and Increased Transparency”,
agreed upon at the Ministerial Council meeting. The
EEDIM reviewed OSCE commitments in the field of
disaster risk reduction, with discussions ranging from
strengthening disaster risk reduction and management,
through exchanging knowledge and best practices to
improving early warning, preparedness and response
capacities.
In a difficult operational environment, the OCEEA
continued to support participating States in the
implementation of their commitments in the economic and
environmental dimension with the aim of strengthening
security and stability, building confidence and contributing
to prevent conflicts and tensions in the OSCE area. While
many activities could not be held as planned originally, due
to the COVID-19 pandemic, they were successfully turned
into online formats.

consultations in South-Eastern Europe to identify and
map potential climate-related security risks and to
develop co-operative measures for risk reduction through
a participatory process. While the originally planned
workshops could not be held, due to the COVID-19
pandemic, the activity was turned into a series of online
meetings and surveys, which generated successful
results.
In response to the pandemic, the OCEEA also organized
a series of webinars called “Learning and moving forward
together” to discuss the economic and environmental
impact of COVID-19 and ways the OSCE can support
its participating States in coping with and recovering
from the crisis. The webinars addressed issues such as
environmental co-operation in the time of COVID-19; the
impact of the pandemic on connectivity, trade and labour
migration; and the potential of open data to enhance
transparency and accountability. Moreover, in co-operation
with the OSCE High Commissioner on National Minorities
a webinar was organized on the economic consequences
of COVID-19 on national minorities.

The OCEEA offered support to promote good governance
and a positive business climate, with a focus on preventing
and combating corruption; ensuring asset recovery
and seizure; fostering connectivity, through trade and
transport facilitation; and tackling socio-economic
disparities, through effective migration governance,
economic empowerment of women, and human capital
development. The OCEEA conducted consultations, in
partnership with the UNECE Transport Division, on Eurasia
Transport Links, which would result in collective action for
fast, secure, affordable, reliable and environmental friendly
overland transport and trade between Europe and Asia.
The OCEEA also continued its support for activities on
transboundary water co-operation, disaster risk reduction,
environmental good governance, hazardous waste
management, energy security and potential security risks
stemming from climate change. In co-operation with the
Berlin-based think tank adelphi, the OCEEA conducted

BUSINESS FOR A GOOD CAUSE – SUPPORTING SOCIAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP
THROUGH THE WOMEN’S RESOURCE CENTRES IN ARMENIA
The Canadian expert Nazareth Seferian, a Cambridge and Oxford
graduate, is a consultant for the OCEEA’s extrabudgetary project
“Economic empowerment of women in Syunik region and other
regions of Armenia”. He builds the entrepreneurial capacities of
the network of Women’s Resource Centres (WRCs) in Armenia to
establish and run social businesses. The following is a transcript
of an interview with Mr. Seferian about the significance of a social
entrepreneurship approach for civil society organizations.
Mr. Seferian, let’s start from the beginning:
what is “social enterprise”?
The Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus defines
“social enterprise” as a business “whose objective is to
Nazareth Seferian is an expert in sustainable business
address social, economic and environmental challenges
and social entrepreneurship
through an entrepreneurial approach”. Social business inverts
the relative priorities of profitability and social impact. Yet, a social business must be financially
self-sustaining, requiring from those who run it a series of conventional business capabilities,
such as market-oriented thinking, innovativeness and a managerial mindset, combined with a
deep understanding of societal issues and the willingness to move from the maximization of profit
towards people-centred, participatory, inclusive, fair and sustainable business approaches.
Why is a social economy approach relevant for a civil society organization (CSO) such as the
network of WRCs?
The social business model can offer a viable balance between social objectives and financial
goals, allowing CSOs to gain greater financial sustainability to pursue their societal transformation
objectives. Furthermore, social enterprises usually offer an enabling environment for vulnerable
groups to (re-) enter the labour market, empowering those left behind and providing opportunities
for quality jobs. The WRC network is determined to pool the potentialities of the social business
model to enhance women’s economic participation and catalyse the attention of public entities on
the need to rethink economic development towards more sustainable and inclusive patterns. Today,
this is even more important in view of the disruptive impact of COVID-19 on world economy.
Can you provide some concrete examples of social enterprises run by WRCs?
WRCs are developing social businesses in three areas: textiles, eco-tourism/hospitality and
education services for children and teenagers. During the training, we delved into business planning
and management, social branding, social marketing and innovation. The aim is to ensure that
products and services provided by WRCs fully reflect the values and mission of the network so that
customers feel like they are part of something bigger, that they are contributing to social change
and transformation. Developing a social brand helps increase loyalty on the part of employees,
customers and community members. With greater loyalty comes greater profitability – for a good
cause. Making full use of innovation and digital technologies is an integral part of this effort.
The OCEEA hired you in 2020 to improve the social entrepreneurial skills of WRCs. How were
you able to perform your tasks in times of COVID-19?
Surprisingly enough, online webinars offered more than one opportunity: a greater focus on the needs of
each WRC and each participant, more flexibility to meet when more suitable, greater interactivity due to
the limited number of participants and more rounds of discussions according to the participants’ requests
and demands. To make online events effective, a great deal of preparatory work was necessary. Based
on a preliminary needs assessment, the overall plan of webinars, challenges and opportunities as well as
expected results were discussed extensively and repeatedly with the OCEEA project team, always online.
By combining profit with keen attention to the impact on individuals as well as the social
and natural environments, the social economy business model offers a suitable approach
to rebalance socio-economic disparities. The OCEEA discussed this approach throughout
2020, particularly in light of the pressing policy dilemmas triggered by COVID-19 and the need
to plan a post-pandemic recovery that can foster social cohesion and economic inclusion,
particularly of the most vulnerable such as women, youth, minorities and migrants.

STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT FOR
REMEDIATION OF URANIUM LEGACY
SITES IN KYRGYZSTAN
In 2020, the OCEEA in co-operation with the United
Nations Development Programme (UNDP) implemented
the project “Stakeholder Engagement for Uranium Legacy
Remediation in Central Asia, Phase II”, funded under the
EU Instrument for Nuclear Safety Cooperation programme.
Within the project, the OSCE is responsible for public
awareness-raising and community outreach activities,
most of which are implemented by the Aarhus Centres in
Osh under the guidance of the OSCE Programme Office
in Bishkek and in close partnership with the Ministry
of Emergency Situations of Kyrgyzstan, the UNDP, the
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development
and Rosatom. The OSCE supported the three Public
Environmental Information Centres in Mailuu-Suu,
Shekaftar and Min-Kush to ensure that more than
10,000 local residents were able to receive up-to-date and
official information and guidance regarding remediation
works and radiation safety, and they had the opportunity
to raise their concerns on these measures.
As part of a project focused on public participation in
decision-making processes, 42 representatives from
the municipalities of Min-Kush and Shekaftar as well as
local community members participated in an experience
exchange visit to Mailuu-Suu to study best practices and
experiences in engaging the local population during the
remediation of uranium legacy sites. During the open-air
event, participants visited the remediated sites of former
uranium tailings, dumps and production facilities, where
local residents and authorities shared their experiences
and talked about the challenges they faced during
remediation works in their area. They stressed the
importance of regular and timely awareness-raising
activities among the population about ongoing and
planned works. Furthermore, around 5,000 copies of
information materials on planned remediation works at
uranium legacy sites and radiation safety and legislative
documents concerning public participation during

the remediation process, such as posters, booklets,
banners and guidelines, were distributed among the local
population.
For Kanat Almanbetov, head of the Min-Kush municipality,
outreach to the public is essential for the success of the
remediation process: “The issue of radiation safety has
been a problem for many years in our country. District
authorities and members of the Parliament of Kyrgyzstan
have raised this problem with the Government. At the
beginning of the rehabilitation works at the uranium legacy
sites of Min-Kush, the majority of the population did not
trust the hired companies, but conducting awarenessraising activities for the local population helped change
their views.”
In addition, the OSCE provided expert support to the
Ministry of Emergency Situations of Kyrgyzstan to develop
a national programme on involving and informing the
population in matters related to radiation safety and
the rehabilitation of uranium tailings for 2021–2024. A
survey was conducted among 65 representatives of
governmental organizations, local residents and NGOs on
the issue of information and the involvement of the local
population in rehabilitation activities, and 14 meetings
were held with representatives of government agencies,
international organizations and other partners. The
programme includes an analysis of the current situation,
priority work methods, a detailed action plan and
monitoring and evaluation tools, and it identifies sources of
funding for the implementation of the programme.
“Long-term planning for stakeholder engagement during
the implementation of the rehabilitation projects at
uranium legacy sites plays an important role in raising
the awareness of the local population on radiation safety
measures. It will also help to formulate the Ministry of
Emergency Situations’ 2021–2024 programme with a
focus on public participation in uranium legacy sites
management processes”, said Asel Saitkazieva, Deputy
Director of the Tailings Management Agency under the
Ministry of Emergency Situations of Kyrgyzstan.

As part of the OSCE’s long-term assistance to Moldova and Ukraine in facilitating transboundary cooperation in the Dniester River basin, a number of activities have been organized, starting in 2004, to
promote public participation, effective communication and awareness-raising in the area of environmental
protection in the Dniester basin. The engagement of youth is an integral component of these activities, also
with a view to contributing to the formation of an environmentally conscious generation of young people.
One of these activities is the basin-wide contest of creativity “Colours of the Dniester”, organized
annually since 2008. Its main goal is to interest schoolchildren and students in conservation and
environmental management of the Dniester basin in a creative manner. The competition is held in
various categories, such as drawing, photography, video, short story, poetry, non-fiction and measures
to improve water resources. The 2020 edition of the contest was held under the motto “The climate is
changing – the Dniester is always with us!” The organizers of the contest, which include national and
local water authorities, NGOs as well as schoolteachers in both Moldova and Ukraine, received over
600 individual works, 95 of which were awarded in various categories. Due to restrictions imposed in
response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the contest commission meetings were held remotely, and the
selection of entries was conducted in a hybrid format. The contest is one vivid example of an activity
that brings people together with a common goal. While the works submitted for the contest were diverse
and varied in capturing different aspects of life in the Dniester River basin, all entries shared genuine
consideration for environmental protection of the Dniester and the idea of its long-term preservation.

Combating

The Office of the Special Representative and Co-ordinator for Combating Trafficking
in Human Beings (OSR/CTHB) assists the OSCE participating States in their efforts to
prevent human trafficking, investigate and prosecute perpetrators and protect victims.
In 2020, it held its annual Alliance against Trafficking in Persons Conference, which
is among the largest events dedicated to the issue. This year the Alliance focused on
ending impunity and delivering justice by prosecuting trafficking in human beings;
survivors’ voices were placed at the heart of discussions. The Office also undertook a
number of country visits, including to Ireland.
“YOUR VOICE MATTERS”: SURVIVORS SET
THE TONE AT THE ALLIANCE AGAINST
TRAFFICKING IN PERSONS CONFERENCE
“This is your statement, not ours.” “Really?” Really. When
the Program Officer Anne-Lise Robin and the Office’s
consultant James Bergin told survivors of trafficking they
could make their own statements at the conference, they
could hardly believe it. This year's Alliance Conference
was devoted to enhancing prosecution securing justice
for victims across the OSCE region, and survivors' voices
were at the heart of the event. The OSR/CTHB asked a
number of them to send video messages to be broadcast
throughout the conference, which became an opportunity
to stop and listen to those voices and remind them that
victims should always be the primary consideration of antitrafficking efforts.
States have obligations to uphold, protect and promote the
rights of victims of trafficking in human beings, and what
better way to make this point than hearing from survivors
themselves? When discussing gaps in the criminal justice
system, victims and survivors of trafficking are in the best
position to describe how the system has served them
or let them down, and what their expectations are. They
can inform policy development, and their insights and
perspective lead to more effective and more sustainable
action.

SECRETARIAT  n  Combating trafficking in human beings

Having survivors describe their relationship with the
criminal justice system was fundamental in ensuring that
the outcome and recommendations of the conference
were grounded in the real-life experiences of individuals
who had lived through trafficking. Their statements
added variety and richness to the conference. Ultimately,
survivors’ voices can help mobilize the most important
ingredient in the fight against human trafficking: political
will. Widespread impunity of traffickers continues to be
a grave concern for the rule of law, security and safety in the OSCE region and it is most urgent to replace a
culture of impunity with a culture of justice. That is why the
OSCE Special Representative for Combating Trafficking
in Human Beings closed the conference by urging
participating States to make a declaration of political will
and to set concrete goals towards tripling the number of
prosecutions of human trafficking cases within the next
three years, in the hope that more victims of trafficking can
become survivors.

recommendations, please visit https://www.osce.org/

THE TALE OF A COUNTRY VISIT
“Just call us the Anti-trafficking Grandmas!” the elderly
woman piped up. “Human trafficking grows thanks to
those who pay for it and the witnesses who don’t care
about the victims and don’t speak up. That’s why we
decided to speak up! We have been living in this area,
and we know everybody here; the police officers cannot
be everywhere all the time; we can help them.” The local
activists OSCE Special Representative and Co-ordinator
for Combating Trafficking in Human Beings Valiant
Richey met in Dublin are a unique example of grass-roots
commitment. Every day, they report suspicious signs
of human trafficking – particularly sexual exploitation –
occurring in their communities. “Their engagement is
proof of the ‘whole of society approach’ in preventing and
combating human trafficking”, says Tarana Baghirova of
the OSR/CTHB.

Country visits are at the core of the Office of the Special
Representative’s mandate. They require extensive
research, analysis and consultation and allow the Office
to receive first-hand information, assess the situation on
the ground, identify good practices and make practical
recommendations to national authorities. In February
2020, the Special Representative visited Ireland to meet
with civil society organizations, health and legal service
providers, law enforcement representatives, prosecutors,
legislators and government officials. He also visited
shelters for adults and children and migrant reception
facilities to evaluate the existing practical mechanisms for
victim identification and protection.
“We don’t go there to criticize, but to support”, explains
Andrea Salvoni from the Special Representative’s team.
“Governments are generally committed to combating
human trafficking, and the OSCE’s role is to assist them in
this. Coming in with a red pen, telling them everything they
do is wrong, will certainly not help them in identifying and
supporting more victims or putting more traffickers behind
bars. However, coming in with an open mind, and with

the knowledge and expertise you have to offer, can help
countries turn the tide.”
In Ireland, the OSR/CTHB delegation was met with
openness and transparency. During the consultations,
they observed that state and non-state actors were
conscious of the issues, aware of what was missing and
willing to work hard for solutions. “Everywhere we went,
we saw eagerness to improve their response and make
use of our recommendations”, the OSR/CTHB colleagues
recall.
Following country visits, the Office not only provides
concrete recommendations but also helps with their
implementation. “Change requires both avenues: you
need the right policies in place to address a problem,
but you also need actors on the ground who are trained
and committed to implementing those policies. The OSR/
CTHB can bridge the two worlds and help combat human
trafficking at every level”, concludes the OSCE Special
Representative, Valiant Richey.

Gender
equality

Senior Adviser on Gender Issues: Amarsanaa Darisuren
Budget: €446,400 (Unified budget), €222,339 (Extrabudgetary actual expenditure)
Staff: 12 (including 3 under extrabudgetary projects)
www.osce.org/secretariat/gender

Gender equality is an important cross-dimensional component of the OSCE’s
comprehensive approach to security. The Organization has intensified its efforts to build
internal capacities for mainstreaming gender in all of its programmes, activities and
initiatives. It also continues to provide vital support to participating States in key areas
such as implementing the women, peace and security agenda; combating violence
against women and girls; and promoting the role of women in mitigating the negative
impacts of natural disasters and environmental degradation.
2020 – REVIEWING AND RENEWING COMMITMENTS
TO GENDER EQUALITY
The year 2020 was a pivotal one for gender equality, as
the international community marked the 25th anniversary
of the Beijing Platform for Action for the Advancement
of Women, the 20th anniversary of UN Security Council
Resolution 1325 on Women, Peace and Security, and the
fifth anniversary of the adoption of the global Sustainable
Development Goals. In the context of global stocktaking,
the OSCE Secretariat, together with the Albanian Chair-inOffice and ODIHR, held the third Gender Equality Review
Conference (GERC) on 27–28 October 2020 in a fully
virtual format. The Conference provided an opportunity for
the OSCE to reflect on its own progress since the second
Review Conference in 2017, on the implementation of
the 2004 OSCE Action Plan for the Promotion of Gender
Equality, and to set a course for future action.
The Conference focused on reviewing the implementation
of OSCE commitments on gender equality during thematic
working sessions covering women’s participation in
political and public life and in the security sector, as well
as women’s economic empowerment. A cross-section of
over 300 representatives of OSCE participating States,
executive structures, other intergovernmental institutions,
civil society organizations and academia attended.
The Gender Issues Programme played an instrumental
role in the review process. It prepared three thematic
review papers on preventing and combating violence
against women in the OSCE region, promoting equal
opportunities in the economic sphere and women’s
participation in conflict prevention, and supporting crisis
management and post-conflict reconstruction. ODIHR
prepared a fourth review paper in the series on promoting
women’s participation in political and public life. The
papers provided an overview of progress and highlighted
gaps, challenges and recommendations for future action.
They also served as food for thought for discussion
and debate at the GERC. Based on the findings and
recommendations outlined in the papers, the Gender
Issues Programme organized a series of subregional
and regional expert round-table meetings on eliminating
violence against women and on women, peace and
security, which continued into 2021.

SECRETARIAT  n  Gender equality

In commemoration of the 20th anniversary of the
women, peace and security agenda (WPS), the Gender
Issues Programme organized a high-level event with UN
Women and the OSCE Troika on the topic of renewing
commitments to the women, peace and security agenda
in the OSCE region. The 12 October discussion focused
on real experiences and good practices in implementing
the WPS agenda and on practical proposals for future
action, and panellists and participants identified a need
for stronger commitments and greater efforts to include
women at all stages of the conflict cycle.
COVID-19 AND THE IMPACT ON GENDER EQUALITY
The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on
everyone, but it has disproportionately affected women
and girls and exacerbated pre-existing inequalities. The
Gender Issues Programme raised awareness of the
impact of the pandemic on women and women’s rights
by organizing a series of webinars for OSCE staff and
participating States. The first one was titled “Gender
equality and security: opportunities and challenges for
including the gender perspective in COVID-19 crisis
responses”. Another webinar organized in collaboration
with the Albanian Chair-in-Office, called “Combating
the pandemic within the COVID-19 pandemic: violence
against women and girls”, discussed the rise in domestic
violence as a result of lockdown measures and provided
concrete recommendations on the inclusion of genderbased violence prevention and response in post-recovery

action plans and on improving the access to services for
survivors of gender-based violence.
The webinars shed light on the disproportionate impact
of the COVID-19 pandemic on women’s rights and
well-being, and demonstrated that targeted action is
needed to prevent a regression of hard-won progress on
gender equality. They provided participating States with
recommendations and good practices, as well as a list of
resources, to improve their emergency response.
COVID-19 has also had a significant impact on the
situation of women in conflict-affected areas, on
women’s civil society organizations working on peace
and on the delivery of services to populations in affected
areas. The Gender Issues Programme partnered with
the Women’s Regional Platform for Peace Dialogue
(WRPPD) to organize a targeted online discussion on the
consequences of COVID-19 consequences for women
living in Eastern Europe, the South Caucasus and
Central Asia. The WRPPD is a forum for women peace
and human rights activists from countries in Eastern
Europe, the Baltic region, the South Caucasus and

rights was a focus area of the OSCE’s Gender Issues Programme in 2020.

Central Asia working on preventing conflict, protecting
the human rights of women and girls and increasing
human security. The 29 May discussion provided
a platform for WRPPD members to inform OSCE
ambassadors and other international stakeholders about
the challenges that women in the region were facing
because of COVID-19. It was important for women
peacebuilders on the ground to share their experiences
and concerns with the international community and to
have their voices heard.
“The fact that the impact of measures on women’s
security often were considered later or not at all shows
the importance of the participation of women in crisis
management at all stages.”
“During times of crisis, we have to be extra vigilant [to
ensure] that the gains achieved on gender equality are
not lost, as persistent inequality might actually worsen
if not properly addressed from the onset.”

As the primary institution within the OSCE focusing on the human dimension of security,
the Warsaw-based Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR)
provides support, assistance and expertise to governments and civil society in OSCE
participating States to promote democracy, the rule of law, human rights, tolerance and
non-discrimination and respect for the rights of Roma and Sinti.

“2020 was a hard year for us all. At the same time, it
brought home our shared humanity, and in this way it
was an opportunity to face unprecedented challenges
by strengthening our commitments to strong institutions,
the rule of law, tolerance, respect for human rights and
freedoms, and democratic elections. ODIHR continued
to work towards this aim, without pause, while effectively
adapting to the new situation.”

Office undertook the necessary measures to provide
adequate training, while also implementing sanitation
and hygiene measures, to mitigate the risk of COVID-19
transmission during its observation activities.
Over the year, the Office published some 50 electionrelated reports that comprehensively assessed electoral
processes for consistency with OSCE commitments,

ELECTIONS
During 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic and related
response measures put the conduct of elections at risk
across the OSCE region. Following the initial wave of
postponed or cancelled elections and the accompanying
legal and practical challenges, elections took place
throughout the rest of the year. ODIHR was the first
intergovernmental organization to resume election
observation activities during the pandemic, deploying
observers to 16 elections in 15 participating States. The

international obligations and other standards. Thirteen final
reports provided recommendations to participating States
on means of improving their election processes. In 2020,
the Office supported eight participating States in their
efforts to adddress ODIHR's electoral recommendations.
This support took the form of technical expertise for
Ukraine (provided during a country visit) and technical
advice and reviews of proposed amendments to electoral
legislation for Albania, Estonia, Georgia, Kyrgyzstan,
Moldova, Montenegro and Poland.

more effective than ever. Inclusive societies make better
democracies, for the benefit of all."
Annika Ojala

Association, Finland

COVID-19 AND ALTERNATIVE VOTING METHODS

Another key aspect of ODIHR’s democratization work
in 2020 was the promotion of open and inclusive
lawmaking in the difficult circumstances caused by the
health emergency. The Office reviewed 22 pieces of draft
legislation from 10 OSCE participating States – often at the
request of OSCE field operations – on a range of issues,
from the judiciary and political party regulation to freedoms
of association, religion and belief, and assembly, all of
which were in some way impacted by the pandemic.
Throughout the year, ODIHR also examined ways in which
the pandemic affected freedom of movement, the human
rights of those displaced by conflicts and the treatment
of migrants. The Office helped share good practices and
assisted states in developing policies that take a human
rights–based approach.

Following the onset of the pandemic, the Office supported
a number of states in adapting parliamentary working
practices and legislation, including through the use of new
technologies, to strengthen parliamentary integrity. ODIHR
stepped up its focus on the political participation of women,
youth and people with disabilities in policy-making through
the development of tools for participating States to assess
their practices and legislation, to increase accessibility and
to make institutions more inclusive. For example, ODIHR
backed parliamentary inclusion efforts in both Ukraine
and Uzbekistan, commissioning surveys of individuals
with various types of disabilities about their access to

through its Disability Inclusion Checklist for Parliaments.

With most OSCE participating States predominantly
using in-person voting with paper ballots in polling
stations, countries holding elections during the
COVID-19 pandemic have had to employ special
measures, such as adjustments to the layout of polling
premises, more stringent queue control and the use
of personal protective equipment, disinfectants and
personal or single-use pens. Beyond these measures,
more profound modifications to voting methods and
procedures, including a shift away from traditional
paper-based voting in polling stations on election day,
were widely discussed as possible alternatives. ODIHR
contributed to this discussion through its paper on
alternative voting methods and arrangements, which
focuses on benefits, risks and practical considerations
in light of international standards and good practice,
including in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.

53

-----------------------Page 55 End-----------------------

ODIHR swiftly adjusted its work and stepped up its
monitoring and assessment of emerging human rights
concerns and its assistance for state institutions to address
the emergency in line with human dimension commitments.
ODIHR provided tailored capacity-building support,
policy advice and thematic analysis, and forged new and
existing partnerships with international organizations,
state institutions and civil society. This included the
development of practical tools such as guidance on
monitoring places of detention through the COVID-19
pandemic for oversight bodies of places of detention,
in collaboration with the Association for the Prevention
of Torture, and guidance on human rights and gender
equality during public emergencies. ODIHR also
supported national human rights institutions, producing
a reference tool on their role in times of emergency and
through training organized with the European Network of
National Human Rights Institutions. Emerging trends in
trafficking of human beings and their impact on victims
and survivors were examined in a report produced with
UN Women based on a global survey of survivors of
trafficking and front-line stakeholders.
“The right to defend and the right to
be defended were the foundation of
the Copenhagen Document. We need
to remember this, especially in today’s
environment, where I sometimes have
the impression that being called a
‘human rights defender’ is a stigma
rather than recognition of their crucial role in upholding
OSCE commitments. That must be challenged.”
Gerald Staberock
Secretary General of the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT)

TOLERANCE AND NON-DISCRIMINATION
The year 2020 brought home the relevance of ODIHR’s
work in the field of tolerance and non-discrimination.
ODIHR provided a platform for dialogue on ways in which
states and civil society can root out the discrimination,
intolerance and racism with which all societies continue
to grapple and which increased in many places after the
outbreak of the pandemic.
In May, the first ever Supplementary Human Dimension
Meeting to be held online addressed the scapegoating
of minorities during the COVID-19 pandemic, examining
measures to prevent intolerant discourse – including
cyberhate – from undermining the social fabric and
escalating into conflict. This was followed in September
by a webinar on the role of youth in countering racism and
xenophobia in the OSCE region.
Victims remain at the centre of ODIHR’s work to address
hate crime. In 2020, the Office launched a two-year project
on hate crime victim support. By utilizing online platforms,
the project brought together experts from 41 project
countries to exchange good practices, map available
support structures and develop resources to ensure that
hate crime victims’ needs are met. This victim-centred
approach was also reflected in the publication of two
practical guides on hate crime victims in the criminal justice
system and on the security needs of Muslim communities.
The Office also launched the second phase of its Words
into Action project and, in co-operation with UNESCO,
54

published a set of four teaching curricula to address antiSemitism in schools.

Contact Point on Roma and Sinti Issues
As in previous years, 2020 started with an ambitious
work plan comprising activities on the ground, capacitybuilding and training, and numerous local and regional
events. The Contact Point for Roma and Sinti Issues
was quick to reassess its schedule and adjust it in order
to continue supporting states in their efforts to increase
Roma participation. The Nicolae Gheorghe Roma
Leadership Academy was tailored to online delivery and
was successfully organized for two groups of young Roma
leaders. While recognizing that Roma communities face
challenges accessing online tools, ODIHR is working to
transform its training of trainers on police and Roma as well
as for Roma human rights defenders into online instruments
so they can continue to be provided in local communities.
These will be hosted and delivered through an online training
and education platform, allowing human rights work with
Roma communities to continue until the pandemic subsides.
Although 2020 brought with it a number of limitations and
challenges, ODIHR’s quick adaptation, new skills and
competencies allowed it to continue to serve participating
States in meeting their human dimension commitments.

High
Commissioner
on National
Minorities

High Commissioner: Ambassador Lamberto Zannier (until July 2020);
Ambassador Kairat Abdrakhmanov (appointed in December 2020)
Budget: €3,504,000 (Unified budget), €721,440 (Extrabudgetary actual expenditure)
Staff: 20 international, 12 local (including 5 under extrabudgetary projects)
www.osce.org/hcnm

The position of OSCE High Commissioner on National Minorities (HCNM) was
established in 1992 after interethnic hostilities swept through Eastern Europe. The High
Commissioner’s mandate is to prevent conflict in the OSCE region by providing early
warning and taking early action at the first sign of tensions involving national minorities.
Using quiet diplomacy and a long-term programmatic approach, the High Commissioner
identifies and addresses the root causes of interethnic tensions and works closely
with the 57 OSCE participating States, providing advice on inclusive policies for
well-integrated multi-ethnic societies founded on dialogue, mutual understanding
and respect for diversity.
THE IMPACT OF COVID-19 ON MINORITIES
When the coronavirus pandemic took hold in early 2020,
the High Commissioner acted swiftly, urging governments
to develop COVID-19 responses that were inclusive and
sensitive to minorities’ needs. A formal HCNM statement
provided six recommendations for the 57 participating
States’ initial COVID-19 responses, urging them to uphold
human rights; to be inclusive; to be sensitive to language
needs; to protect the economically vulnerable, especially
minority women, who are often disproportionately
affected; to maintain zero tolerance for discrimination
and xenophobia; and to build on positive examples to
promote social inclusion. An HCNM webinar called “The
Impact of Covid-19 on Minorities: Emerging Lessons about
Risks and Good Practices” and online video clips, or
“explanimations”, elaborated on this. Throughout 2020, the
focus was on protecting the rights of national minorities
and the safety and health of staff during the pandemic,
while the High Commissioner continued his regular conflict
prevention work with minimal disruption.
Working online rapidly became the norm, with online
meetings resulting in closer relationships with distant
partners. Inevitably, there were casualties too: the
ceremony to present the award to the winner of the
2020 Max van der Stoel Award was postponed until
autumn 2021, as the past and present winners are always
physically present at the ceremony. A representative of
the Pavee Point Traveller and Roma Centre, winner of the
2020 Max van der Stoel Award, will collect the award in
person in 2021 for the Centre’s pioneering work in Ireland
to protect Roma and Travellers’ rights.
“As governments rush to introduce emergency measures,
it is also vital that they remember to include the needs
of everyone in society, including persons belonging to
national minorities and other marginalized communities.”
Lamberto Zannier
High Commissioner on National Minorities

INSTITUTIONS  n  High Commissioner on National Minorities

MULTI-YEAR COMMITMENTS
The High Commissioner continued supporting
governments and minority groups through multi-year
country and regional programmes, such as the Central
Asian Education Programme with its popular winter
and summer schools on multilingual education (MLE)
for teachers from all over Central Asia. One important
milestone was the conclusion of a five-year multilingual
education pilot programme in Ukraine, culminating in
the production of an MLE training manual, a high-level
conference for policymakers and five MLE round tables,
including one just before lockdown titled “The Formation
of Multilingualism in Children and Pupils: Progressive
European Ideas in the Ukrainian Context”.
Inclusive societies with respect for diversity are the High
Commissioner’s aspirational benchmark. Success requires
political will, a specific skill set and an awareness and
understanding of minority issues. Therefore, the HCNM
always welcomes requests from governments to train
civil servants to manage and mainstream diversity in their
work. In 2020, the HCNM finalized a training programme
on diversity management for the government of Ukraine.
A diversity management training manual was produced
as part of this initiative, and seven in-house trainers were
licensed to deliver the programme.
THE UNIFYING ROLE OF LANGUAGE
COVID-19 exposed the vulnerability of those on the
margins of society by revealing how critical it is to have
access to information in one’s own language during an
emergency. The High Commissioner therefore continued
to encourage states to provide basic services in the
languages used by various communities, especially for
healthcare and official COVID-19 communications.
Bridges can also be built between communities through
basic language learning. The year 2020 saw digital
launches of two pioneering language-learning products
that facilitate communication across the language divide.
The first is a day-to-day phrasebook in Albanian and

55

-----------------------Page 57 End-----------------------

Macedonian. The second – an everyday speaking guide
developed in Cyprus – offers basic phrases in Greek,
Turkish and two associated Cypriot dialects. Both are the
result of co-operation with two former Max van der Stoel
Award winners: the Association for Historical Dialogue
and Research, based in Cyprus, and the Nansen Dialogue
Centre Skopje, based in North Macedonia.

High-Level Dialogue was co-organized by the HCNM to
show the link between peace, stability, effective models of
inclusive governance and autonomy issues. COVID-19 also
prompted an OSCE-wide webinar called “The Economic
Consequences of COVID-19 on National Minorities”,
further highlighting the importance of helping national
minorities participate fully in socio-economic life.

EFFECTIVE PARTICIPATION
While language has the power to unite and inform people,
and multilingual education can help to achieve this, an
inclusive, integrated society can be achieved only if
everyone participates fully. Recognizing that members of
minority groups are often absent from public life, the High
Commissioner continued to engage with governments
on this issue. In Uzbekistan, two round tables explored
how national minorities could participate effectively in
public, socio-economic, cultural and religious life. In
Georgia, the “Multiparty Dialogue on National Minority
Issues in Georgia” aimed to increase the participation
of national minorities in public affairs with a series of
round-table discussions in Tbilisi, four televised debate
shows, seminars for minority youth and a study tour for
minority youth to meet decision makers. In Moldova,
the findings of a two-year HCNM study into the effective
participation of national minorities in public life in Moldova
was presented to the government, and in September a

THEMATIC FOCUS AND EVENTS
The HCNM’s thematic guidelines and recommendations
encapsulate the advice of successive High Commissioners
on nine themes affecting national minorities. Work on new
thematic areas continued in 2020, including the participation
of national minorities in socio-economic life and contested
histories. The latter is timely, with domestic disputes about
emblems, statues and historical representation flaring up
in 2020 and featuring in the international media. In 2020,
preparations got under way for the 25th anniversary of
The Hague Recommendations regarding the Education
Rights of National Minorities (1996) and the 15th anniversary
of the Recommendations on Policing in Multi-Ethnic
Societies (2006). To prepare, online discussions were held
on principles and good practices for policing in diverse
societies, co-organized with the US Helsinki Commission,
and a webinar called “The evolution and practice of
multilingual education: From The Hague Recommendations
to the digital era” was also held.

Representative
on Freedom of
the Media

Representative: Harlem Désir (until July 2020),
Teresa Ribeiro (appointed in December 2020)
Budget: €1,608,800 (Unified budget), €257,623 (Extrabudgetary actual expenditure)
Staff: 17
www.osce.org/representative-on-freedom-of-media

The Representative on Freedom of the Media (RFoM) observes media developments in
the participating States, advocates and promotes full compliance with the Organization’s
principles and commitments in respect of freedom of expression and free media, and
responds to serious non-compliance therewith. 2020 was the year in which Freimut Duve,
who created the Office and served as the first RFoM from 1998 to 2003, passed away.
THE PANDEMIC
In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic created unprecedented
and wide-ranging obstacles to freedom of expression,
access to information and journalists’ ability to carry out their
work. From the imposition of states of emergency to the
blocking of news websites and the adoption of legislation
aimed at tackling the spread of disinformation related to the
pandemic, participating States across the region placed
stringent restrictions on access to information and journalists’
work. Alongside this, journalists and media workers faced
increasing violence, harassment and threats to their safety,
from both the authorities and citizens, particularly during a
large number of demonstrations. The economic sustainability
of media outlets was also a victim of the pandemic, with
countless media outlets forced to close or lay off workers.
The pandemic threatens media outlets, but also society’s
wider access to information and media plurality as a whole,
especially minority journalism and marginalized voices.
To counter these negative trends, the RFoM made many
interventions on the impact of COVID-19 on media freedom,
highlighting the importance of promoting and protecting
access to, and the free flow of, information during the
pandemic. In several cases, these efforts led to a change
of intended regulations and policies that could have been
detrimental to media freedom.

INSTITUTIONS  n  Representative on Freedom of the Media

“There is no freedom without media freedom. Stay
strong and dedicated to this great idea!” Freimut Duve,
founder of the OSCE Representative on Freedom of the
Media, spoke these words in 2017 on the occasion of
the Office’s 20th anniversary. It was his grand idea that
led to the establishment of the RFoM, which he built from
the ground up and made into a staunch advocate of
freedom of expression. Duve, who passed away in March
2020, relentlessly promoted the importance of media
freedom as a pillar of democracy and a cornerstone for
building societies that enjoy civil rights and fundamental
freedoms. He knew that journalists should be able
to provide objective and reliable information so that
citizens can make informed decisions and hold their
elected representatives accountable for their actions.

-----------------------Page 59 End-----------------------

COUNTRY VISITS AND CONFERENCES
In the few months before the first lockdown in March, the
RFoM visited Ukraine to hold discussions with the authorities,
the media community and international organizations,
focusing particularly on two new draft laws. The Office later
reviewed one of these draft laws as part of the three legal
reviews that the Office published in 2020. In March, the
Office organized its Second Central Asia Judicial Dialogue
meeting in Samarkand, Uzbekistan. During this meeting,
judges from higher and appellate courts from all Central Asian
countries, as well as international experts and judges from
other OSCE participating States discussed legal measures
against incitement to interethnic and religious enmity, as well
as defamation and insult.
Because of COVID-19-related measures and restrictions,
the Office conducted its work online from late March

onwards. The Office put a spotlight on the impact of
artificial intelligence (AI) on freedom of expression, as
part of its #SAIFE project. By organizing a round table
in March, the Representative provided a platform to
examine the challenges and contributions that machinelearning technologies, such as AI, can bring to freedom of
expression and media freedom. These discussions were
further developed through interviews with experts on the
topic, which fed into the development of an AI Strategy
Paper elaborating on the aforementioned challenges and
exploring applicable international and regional standards
on AI and human rights. The Paper’s recommendations
were discussed at a subsequent event in June that brought
together a broad audience of 200 participants, including
experts from participating States, civil society, academia,
the tech industry and other relevant international
stakeholders.

SAFETY OF JOURNALISTS
The RFoM continued to address the specific threats and harassment faced by
female journalists online. In the framework of its Safety of Female Journalists
Online (#SOFJO) project, and to commemorate the International Day to End
Impunity for Crimes against Journalists on 2 November, the Office launched
its #SOFJO Resource Guide. Aimed at helping state and non-state actors
across the OSCE region to take real action to improve the digital safety of
female journalists, the Guide provides action proposals for ten key actors.
The safety of journalists remained a top priority for the Office of the
RFoM. In November, the Office published the third edition of the Safety
of Journalists Guidebook, which provides an overview of the safety
situation facing journalists over the last three years. Alongside this, the
Office published a special report with updated recommendations on the
handling of the media during public assemblies. This report elaborates
on the role of both law enforcement agencies and journalists during
public events, and offers observations and recommendations to facilitate
the media’s ability to cover such events without undue hindrance.

REGIONAL MEDIA CONFERENCES
The Office was also able to organize its annual regional
media conferences in 2020, albeit in an online format. In
September, in co-operation with the OSCE Mission to
Serbia and with the support of all OSCE field missions in
the region, the Office held the seventh “South East Europe
Media Conference”, focusing on the overarching impact of the
COVID-19 pandemic on media freedom and journalists’ ability
to perform their professional activities. The event, which
gathered upwards of 200 participants, also examined national
mechanisms to ensure the safety of journalists and the efforts
needed to tackle the specific challenges faced by female
journalists online. In October, the 22nd “Central Asia Media
Conference” took place with over 150 participants from the
region. The event addressed such topics as the promotion

58

of diversity in mainstream media; ways of countering
disinformation, hate speech and so-called harmful content;
and the challenges arising from the COVID-19 pandemic. In
November, the Office organized its 17th “South Caucasus
Media Conference” with over 50 participants from the region,
who discussed the promotion of freedom of information
during health crises and the state of media freedom in
Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia.
Lastly, in November, in the framework of the Cyprus Media
Dialogue project, the Office concluded the second exchange
opportunity between Turkish Cypriot and Greek Cypriot
journalists, with the aim of encouraging co-operation between
media outlets and journalists, and to advance accountable,
quality journalism.

Presence in
Albania

Head of Presence: Ambassador Bernd Borchardt (until August 2020),
Ambassador Vincenzo Del Monaco (from November 2020)
Budget: €2,981,200 (Unified budget), €610,876 (Extrabudgetary actual expenditure)
Staff: 17 international, 73 local
www.osce.org/presence-in-albania

The OSCE Presence in Albania continued to work with its Albanian partners in support of
parliamentary work, border police and the prevention of environmental crime. In addition,
the Presence provided assistance in response to some of the most urgent needs created
by the coronavirus pandemic.
ONLINE PLATFORMS FOR THE ASSEMBLY OF
ALBANIA
The spread of the COVID-19 pandemic and the restrictions
imposed under a state of emergency severely affected all
areas of life in Albania, including the functionality of the
Albanian Assembly. In order to help the Assembly move
all its committee meetings online, the Presence adapted
quickly and provided the needed technical resources to
equip seven committees’ meeting rooms with computer
terminals to be used for online communication platforms.
This support significantly improved the Assembly’s
capacities to conduct online committee meetings
simultaneously, thereby improving the efficiency and
organizational methods of parliamentary work and the
efficiency of support services.

also visited Albania’s main border-crossing points to
assess the overall situation and measures taken in light of
the COVID-19 pandemic.
The General Director of the Albanian State Police, Ardi
Veliu, considered the donation very necessary: “I thank the
Presence for this donation and for the support and assistance
that it has continuously given to the State Police and
specifically to the Border Police. With the opening of borders,
the Border Police will be faced with new challenges regarding
physical distancing and contact with citizens; therefore, we
need to be prepared and fully equipped,” he said.

PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT FOR
ALBANIA’S BORDER POLICE
The Presence donated personal protective equipment
against COVID-19 worth €20,000 to Albania’s Border and
Migration Police at the imminent opening of Albania’s
borders after the first wave of COVID-19, on 28 May 2020.

The Presence has a long history of co-operation with
Albania’s Border and Migration Police; they are currently
working together to establish Hot Pursuit Protocols
and police co-operation centres between Albania and
its neighbouring countries. The Presence also offers
capacity-building for better control of Albania’s borders to
prevent criminal activities such as drug trafficking, human
trafficking, irregular migration and the movement of foreign
terrorists fighters.

The personal protective equipment that the Presence
donated to the Border Police included infrared
thermometers, plastic face shields, carbon face masks,
disinfectants and full-protection bodysuits. They were
distributed to all border-crossing points in Albania,
including ports and the international airport. The Presence

While the Government took action to help vulnerable
communities, the assistance was not sufficient to cover
all their needs. The legislation offers families that are part
of social welfare schemes access to emergency financial
help and food packages. Unfortunately, many Roma and
Egyptian families are not part of welfare schemes, mainly
due to the fact that they are not able to follow up with
registration procedures.
Accordingly, the Presence stepped in with funding from
the OSCE Charity Ball in Vienna to address the needs of
the Roma and Egyptian families, who are among the most
vulnerable people in the country. The OSCE assistance was
channelled through a reputable Roma NGO, which was
already operating in the field and distributing humanitarian
assistance. The Charity Ball Fund donation of €9,000
enabled the Presence to offer food packages to 450
families in eight cities across Albania during the first two
weeks of June 2020. Thus, packages of groceries and
basic hygiene items (soap, detergents) were distributed
to vulnerable Roma and Egyptian families that had not
benefitted from state emergency schemes. “It was a great
help”, said a Roma beneficiary. “You provided food for my
children for the next three weeks.” Through this intervention,
the Presence showed its commitment to promoting and
supporting the improvement of the living conditions of the
most vulnerable communities in Albanian society.
MITIGATING ENVIRONMENTAL VIOLATIONS
In 2020, state authorities reported an increase in
environmental violations. This was mainly due to
weakened environmental inspections, which came as a
result of the environmental inspectorate’s restructuring in
2019 that split it into five new agencies.
The Government called on the Presence to provide
support by conducting an institutional assessment of
key environmental enforcement agencies, which resulted
in key recommendations for central state institutions to
resolve various overlaps between agencies. Before the
pandemic, the Presence worked with various central state
institutions to organize a national scientific conference
dedicated to environmental crime, environmental security
and national security. The Presence produced an
infographic and a short video highlighting its work in the
field of environmental activities for the period 2015–2020.
An important achievement was the support provided to the
Consultative Group (CG) composed of CSOs, media and
youth, which acts as a bridge with environmental authorities
to expose environmental violations. On this basis, the
Group produced a database and a quarterly electronic
newsletter describing cases of environmental violations,
which were handed over to the respective state authorities.

Mission to
Bosnia and
Herzegovina

Head of Mission: Ambassador Kathleen Kavalec
Budget: €11,682,000 (Unified budget), €838,835 (Extrabudgetary actual expenditure)
Staff: 34 international, 281 local
http://www.osce.org/bih

The OSCE Mission to Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) adjusted quickly to the pandemic,
shifting activities online, providing direct support to partners and working with
institutions at all levels to co-ordinate pandemic responses. Local elections took place
across BiH in November and December: the Mission’s support to free and fair elections
helped ensure that elections ran smoothly – in the interest of every citizen. At the same
time, the Mission continued working on achieving its long-term goals: helping to foster a
stable, secure and democratic society.

ADAPTING TO COVID-19
COVID-19 has presented numerous challenges in BiH:
human rights concerns, increases in domestic violence,
new opportunities for corruption, difficulties in securing
personal protective equipment (PPE), and the closing of
schools and the transfer to distance learning.
By moving its operations online, the Mission continued
to make progress on its long-term priorities. Training
programmes for institutions were maintained thanks to
innovative ICT tools. Investing in BiH’s future – for instance,
by continuing the Mission’s Environmental Legal Clinics
for university students online, and helping education
institutions adapt to virtual learning – remained at the core
of the Mission’s agenda.
The Mission adapted its approach to monitoring criminal
justice proceedings by expanding efforts to include trials
on emerging issues. Given the new corruption risks facing
the country, the Mission initiated the development of anticorruption action plans at all government levels. These
plans represent a systemic response to pandemic-related
corruption and strengthen the role of anti-corruption teams
throughout the country. In addition, the Mission offered
guidance to the High Judicial and Prosecutorial Council
(HJPC) and other justice sector actors as they adapted
their work processes to the realities of the pandemic.

and other essentials, including the donation of food and
hygiene products to 371 Roma families, and the provision
of substantial quantities of PPE to the BiH education,
judicial and security sectors.
During this challenging year, the Mission kept its focus on
the future, promoting reconciliation, security and economic
growth. Continued support to the development of the
SUPPORTING SAFE HOUSES
Recognizing the impact of lockdowns on
domestic and gender-based violence, the
Mission reached out to safe houses to
determine what pressures they were facing:
“People are confused, shocked and anxious
… Single mothers, ex-beneficiaries, are calling
us to ask for food, medicines, disinfectants …
We are fighting, but we are also exhausted and
scared.” (Staff member of a safe house)
To assist in keeping these crucial facilities operational,
the Mission distributed food, hygiene products and
PPE to eight safe houses across the country.

Recognizing the human rights–related concerns raised
by emergency legislation introduced in response to
COVID-19, the Mission monitored developments and
worked with counterparts to ensure the continuation of
democratic procedures and respect for human rights.
By procuring e-voting systems and equipment to livestream plenary sessions, the Mission helped enable BiH
parliaments to continue sessions and empowered citizens
to keep democracy in check.
As schools moved to distance learning, the Mission took
the lead in co-ordinating donations to educational systems
from the international community. This helped ensure that
IT equipment and Internet connections were provided to
disadvantaged families, empowering their children to learn
remotely. In response to increased needs in vulnerable
communities and BiH institutions, the Mission shifted
some financial resources to the procurement of PPE

tourism sector in the Majevica and Upper Drina regions –
for example, by fostering cross-entity co-operation,
trust-building and youth empowerment. The Mission
provided IT equipment to key security actors, ensuring
the continuation of work tackling terrorism and organized
crime, as well as the implementation of the BiH Strategy
for Control of Small Arms and Light Weapons, thus helping
keep BiH safe.
CONTRIBUTING TO THE 2020 LOCAL
ELECTIONS
The Mission’s support to free and fair local elections
was broad, placing emphasis on encouraging issuebased dialogue and supporting authorities in effectively
addressing allegations of voter fraud and other
irregularities to help rebuild public trust in elections.
The Mission facilitated the signing of election pledges in
26 locations, in which candidates for office committed
to campaign responsibly, refrain from exerting pressure
on voters and avoid inflammatory rhetoric. In addition,
the Mission organized pre-election debates for mayoral
candidates, offering an impartial platform through which
citizens – especially those in isolated communities – could
access policy-based information about the candidates in
their area. These initiatives promoted constructive political
dialogue based on policy issues, helping citizens make
well-informed choices.
The Mission, in co-operation with ODIHR, continued to
support the work of the BiH Central Election Commission
(CEC) to ensure free and fair elections. By providing both
political and technical support, the Mission assisted the
CEC in overcoming political pressure, a long delay in

receipt of its funding and the challenges of the pandemic,
all of which called into question the functioning of the
CEC. To ensure the prompt investigation of allegations of
election fraud, the Mission facilitated information-sharing
among the CEC, prosecutors and law enforcement.
Also, the Mission provided financial support to the NGO
coalition Pod Lupom to monitor the elections, thus
strengthening the capacity of civil society to ensure
voting was conducted in line with the highest international
standards.
The Mission also worked to raise public awareness by
supporting the production of videos on voting under
COVID-19 restrictions and on combating election fraud.
These helped inform citizens about how to vote safely and
how to report potential fraud.
BRČKO FREEDOM OF ASSEMBLY LAW: THE
MISSION’S ROLE
The Mission remained focused on improving the
protection of human rights in BiH. Following the Mission’s
assessment that legislation on freedom of peaceful
assembly (FoPA) across BiH’s 12 jurisdictions largely
failed to meet international standards, the Mission and
the Office of the High Representative presented the
assessment to the Brčko District (BD) authorities, who
saw an opportunity to embrace reform. The Mission
collaborated with BD authorities in the drafting of a new
law on FoPA, which was adopted on 29 July. The new
legislation has been heralded as a best practice in the
European context. The Mission looks forward to working
with other jurisdictions in 2021 to facilitate the adoption of
similar laws across BiH.

Mission in
Kosovo

Head of Mission: Ambassador Jan Braathu
Budget: €17,462,600 (Unified budget), €267,244 (Extrabudgetary actual expenditure)
Staff: 117 international, 387 local
www.osce.org/mission-in-kosovo

The OSCE Mission continued to work closely with public institutions in promoting
intercommunity dialogue and community rights, property rights and respect for cultural
heritage; supporting police to enhance public safety and security; facilitating electoral
reform processes; and fostering media and information literacy.

MISSION TRAINS TEACHERS TO MANAGE
COVID-19 CONSEQUENCES
The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic created one of
the biggest challenges the education sector in Kosovo3
has ever faced. The rapid closure of educational facilities
and the urgent need to shift from classroom to online
learning put an enormous strain on teachers and students.
“Students of all ages, both young women and men, had
their in-person contact discontinued and lost the physical
presence of their peers. These challenges burdened
young people and inevitably caused stress and possible
mental and emotional health problems”, said Ambassador
Jan Braathu, Head of the OSCE Mission in Kosovo.
According to research conducted by the University of
Prishtina on the effects of COVID-19 in education, the
pandemic has affected students’ mental health. Notably,
65.4 per cent of students reported moderate stress
levels, whereas 26.9 per cent reported high stress levels.
Additionally, the Kosovo Association of Psychiatrists has
stated that COVID-19 might have long-term negative
effects on human psychology.

To help alleviate this situation, the Mission adapted its
programmes to new circumstances and emerging needs.
Working with a local NGO, a total of 800 teachers from all
of Kosovo’s municipalities and communities were trained
on how to alleviate mental health issues among students
as a consequence of school closures and isolation due
to public health measures. Training sessions included
basic knowledge about stress, stress management and
strategies to prevent the consequences of stress after
the pandemic. Upon completion of the training, teachers
organized stress management activities for students in
their schools.
IMPROVING LANGUAGE COMPLIANCE
During the pandemic, the Mission continued its focus
on community rights, including compliance with official
language use. During the first weeks of the outbreak,
government and municipal institutions struggled to provide
information about the rapidly developing situation in all
official languages. At their request, the Mission assisted
them by providing technical resources to ensure outreach
to all communities.
The Mission supported the Ministry of Local Government
and the Ministry of Health by providing translations of 160
pages of materials into non-majority community languages
at the outset of the pandemic. In June, the Mission also
translated the 150-page government manual for the
prevention of COVID-19, which provides detailed instructions
for the institutional, private and social sectors. The Mission
also co-operated with an association for the blind to print
the most relevant sections of the manual in Braille.
In post-conflict societies such as Kosovo, learning the
language of “the other” is not always a preferred choice, and
this has affected not only communication but also human
relations. As a result, and also due to low demand, the
availability of language courses in schools has been limited.

school closures and social isolation due to public health measures.

Against this backdrop, the Mission has – for many years
now – offered Albanian and Serbian courses to many of its
partners, including staff of local governments, clergy and
more recently media and NGO personnel. Throughout 2020,

CULTURAL HERITAGE MANAGEMENT

preserve and promote cultural heritage sites, the Mission
produced a Guidebook on Standards for Drafting Heritage
Management Plans, which outlines key concepts for
developing state-of-the-art heritage management plans.

as well as staff from domestic violence shelters took
intensive language courses organized by the Mission.
Thanks to this activity, participants from different
communities working in various institutions were able
to better communicate and offer services in both official
languages. Due to COVID-19, the courses were held
online, but this also brought together participants from

different municipalities who otherwise would not have
met and gave them the opportunity to learn and discuss
together.
ASSISTANCE TO SHELTERS FOR VICTIMS OF
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE
As elsewhere, the pandemic exacerbated the risk of
domestic abuse. One week before the lockdown began
in mid-March, the Mission reached out to all domestic
violence shelters to raise awareness of a potential
increase in incidents of domestic violence and to
encourage shelters to prepare. Data later provided by the
Kosovo Police showed that in March 2020, the number
of reported cases of domestic violence had tripled
compared with March 2019. While the spike in cases
tapered off, there was an overall increase of 12.9 per cent
in domestic violence cases for the first eight months of
the year.
To respond to the situation, the Mission launched a
social media campaign to inform the general public
about the services and support available to potential
victims. In these outreach efforts, the Mission was
supported by KFOR, the NATO-led peacekeeping force,
which shared the information through its broadcast
media channels.
The Mission’s consistent, long-term advocacy efforts
secured sustainable financing from municipalities for the
domestic violence shelters in their regions. Between June
and August, 14 of the 38 municipalities in Kosovo signed
Mission-facilitated memoranda of understanding to fund
the shelters for three years.

and promoting gender equality, to building a free, resilient and professional media
landscape, fostering security co-operation and governance and supporting regional
youth reconciliation and exchanges through cooperation with the local branch office of
the Regional Youth Co-operation Office (RYCO).

SUPPORTING LOCAL PUBLIC
BROADCASTERS
When COVID-19 reached Montenegro in March, schools,
cafes and shops closed. Working from home became the
norm, and travel between municipalities in Montenegro
was restricted. For the Mission staff working from home,
the challenge was to find ways to support local partners.
The lockdown brought into focus the importance of reliable
local information. The Mission, in consulting its partner, the
Union of Local Public Service Broadcasters (ULES), realized
that the ULES’s 12 member stations play a vital role in
providing local information in their communities. Together
with the ULES, the Mission developed a plan for these
stations to make better use of the Internet and to bring their
valuable information together in one platform. The Mission
supported the local broadcasters in developing a centralized
website (https://cglocalinfo.me) and an application that is

“In a time of unverified news, sensationalism, populism
and superficiality, citizens need someone they can trust.
Local public broadcasters are indispensable when it
comes to objectively informing local communities and
that they enjoy the trust of citizens. I am grateful to the
OSCE for recognizing the importance of this webpage
because for both the ULES and the OSCE, the citizen
comes first.”

easily accessible on mobile phones. By building on previous
training for local journalists on the use of online and social
media, these stations are now better equipped to reach out
to young people in their communities. This online platform
will help citizens to rediscover their communities and to
engage in local dialogue. Together with the ULES, the

A NEW GENDER EQUALITY STRATEGY
In 2020, the Ministry for Human and Minority Rights sought
the support of the Mission in drafting a new strategy for
gender equality. As a result of the pandemic, the Mission
and Ministry had to develop new processes to engage
46 stakeholders while respecting health measures, to
identify lessons learned from the current National Action
Plan for Gender Equality and to make recommendations
for a new action plan. A questionnaire was developed and
distributed online by the Ministry. This online approach
had an unexpected added benefit, as stakeholders
disseminated the questionnaire further through their email
lists, thereby expanding the range of the consultation. The
public also participated in the process via the Ministry’s
website. The Mission supported this process by facilitating
a survey on the state of gender equality in Montenegro
through Zoom focus groups. The survey found structural
barriers to women’s equal engagement in economic,
social and political activities. With the expanded virtual
consultation process, the Ministry developed a draft
document and articulated its vision for Montenegro
as a “society in which all women and men have equal
opportunities to contribute to cultural, political and social
progress and to enjoy equally all the benefits of the
progress of society”.
COUNTERING DOMESTIC VIOLENCE DURING
THE CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC
Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been
a 27 per cent increase in reported cases of domestic
violence in Montenegro. Acting on this empirical evidence,
after consulting with relevant stakeholders, the Mission
developed a project to support NGOs’ response to

domestic violence and to support the Ombudsperson in
preparing an analysis of cases of domestic and genderbased violence. The Mission also provided IT equipment
to a women’s rights NGO, furniture to a women’s shelter
and sewing machines, manicure/pedicure sets and
toners for textile printing for women developing new startup businesses. The Mission is also in the process of
procuring a prefabricated house to accommodate women
with disabilities and survivors of domestic violence.
ENGAGING YOUTH TO PREVENT AND
COUNTER VIOLENT EXTREMISM AND
RADICALIZATION THAT LEADS TO TERRORISM
The pandemic did not stop the Mission in implementing
its cross-programmatic approach to support Montenegrin
institutions to prevent and counter violent extremism
and radicalization that leads to terrorism (P/CVERLT).
The Mission, working in tandem with the National
Co-ordinator for Combating Violent Extremism in
Montenegro, recognized that, while young people are
the most vulnerable to violent extremism, they also
have the greatest potential to combat it by promoting
peacebuilding, tolerance and intercultural learning.
A workshop for first responders enabled participants to
conduct risk assessments and strengthened their capacity
to recognize, suppress and combat violent extremism
among young people. As part of the Leaders against
Intolerance and Violent Extremism (LIVE) programme,
the Mission trained young people to undertake local
P/CVERLT initiatives. The Mission also gathered young
people to discuss youth engagement in P/CVERLT. “The
workshop changed how I view the world. Now I am more
encouraged and motivated to contribute to combating
[violent extremism and radicalization] and to maintaining
peace. Also now, when extremism, radicalism and even
terrorism are mentioned, I know what it is and how it
works, and I have helped a few people to understand it as
well,” noted a 16-year-old participant from Berane.

“The LIVE programme helped me understand that
democracy and stability in Montenegro depends on
young people perceiving pluralism as a resource rather
than as a liability, and dialogue as the founding pillar of an
inclusive and VERLT-resilient society.”

Budget: €6,506,100 (Unified budget), €531,623 (Extrabudgetary actual expenditure)
Staff: 38 international, 116 local
http://www.osce.org/skopje

In 2020, the OSCE Mission to Skopje continued to support reforms pertinent to
judicial independence, media freedom, community rights, democratization and police
professionalization, while also working to strengthen Parliament and improve electoral
processes. The Mission focused on assisting further implementation of the Ohrid
Framework Agreement and followed security-related developments in the country
based on an early-warning methodology.

STRESS REDUCTION FOR POLICE AND
PRIVATE SECURITY OFFICERS
COVID-19 created unprecedented challenges for law
enforcement agencies and private security companies
as they worked to protect the population during the
pandemic. While carrying out their essential work securing
public order during the crisis, police officers were in
constant contact with citizens, potentially exposing them
to a new layer of danger in their already dangerous work.
To help police officers address the adverse effects of
job-related stress under these difficult conditions, the
Mission supported training on stress management for
89 police officers (62 per cent women and 38 per cent
men). The Mission also provided six similar courses for
150 private security staff (31 per cent women and
69 per cent men) from companies that are members of
the Chamber of Private Security Companies of North
Macedonia, which protect critical infrastructure, including
hospitals, state institutions and municipal buildings.

“Stress management training is extremely valuable for
police officers, as our line of work is extremely specific
and sensitive: we are exposed not only to acute stress
but also to situations that are very risky. Although stress
relief was not an unknown subject to me, the trainers
provided us with a significantly deeper understanding
of the subject and practical exercises to cope with
stress that motivated me to search online for additional
techniques on mental health improvement. When dealing
with stressful situations, I go back to what I have learned
and apply the practices that help me cope with stress. I
believe that it would be very useful for this type of course
to become a part of the regular training programmes for
police forces.”

the Mission reached out to over a million people, while
14 real-world events delivered in full compliance with
local COVID-related protocols engaged more than
16,000 participants of all ages across the entire country.
The campaign aims to debunk rumours that strengthen
negative stereotypes and prejudice towards women and
to raise awareness of the detrimental effects of genderbased discrimination and deeply rooted stereotypes,
while building counter-narratives and greater community
engagement.

MISSION’S COVID-19 RESPONSE FUND
REACHES OUT TO PEOPLE IN NEED
In May 2020, the Mission launched its COVID-19
Response Fund through an exceptional call for proposals
from local CSOs, citizens’ associations and charities
for implementing partnerships to address the needs of
the most vulnerable and underserved communities in
the country during the pandemic. The Fund was open
to proposals for work supporting Mission priorities in
areas including work with youth; people at risk, including
the elderly; people with disabilities, including those with
long-term physical and mental health conditions; smaller
communities, including Roma and Sinti; survivors of
domestic violence, gender-based violence and human

trafficking; and refugees and migrants. The Fund also
accepted proposals focused on human rights protection
and advocacy. Proposals from 11 CSOs were chosen and
implemented at a cost of €153,346.

Staff: 13 international, 40 local

In 2020, the OSCE Mission to Moldova maintained an active mediating role to facilitate
the Transdniestrian settlement process amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

OVERCOMING PANDEMIC CHALLENGES
IN MEDIATING THE TRANSDNIESTRIAN
SETTLEMENT PROCESS
In close co-ordination with the Special Representative
of the Albanian OSCE Chairperson-in-Office for the
Transdniestrian Settlement Process, Ambassador Thomas
Mayr-Harting, the co-mediators and the observers, the
Mission concentrated its efforts on maintaining dialogue
between the Sides and facilitating practical solutions to
the issues affecting the lives of people on both sides of the
Dniester/Nistru River. The Mission’s focus in this regard
was to achieve further progress in the implementation
of the “Berlin-plus” package and to address, through
mediation and on-site monitoring, challenges stemming
from measures taken in the context of the pandemic, such
as the deployment of additional posts in the Security Zone
and the restrictions on freedom of movement introduced
by the Transdniestrian side.
These challenging times demonstrated that achieving
a sustainable Transdniestrian settlement requires not
only building new bridges between the two Sides but,
most importantly, upholding the strong interconnectivity
between the two banks of the Dniester/Nistru River – in
particular the freedom of movement for ordinary people
and businesses. Against this backdrop, the Mission
enhanced its monitoring activities and conducted over
170 visits to the Security Zone from March 2020 until
the end of the year to monitor freedom of movement for
people living on both banks of the Dniester/Nistru River.
The Mission teams put special effort into monitoring the
access of Moldovan farmers to their lands on the left bank
and the crossing of the internal boundary line by pupils
from Moldova-administered Latin-script schools to realize
their right to an education – two confidence-building
measures from the Berlin-plus package. Other activities
aimed to facilitate solutions to maintain and improve
interconnectivity between both banks in areas such as
telecommunications, the use of banking services and
commuting.
The Mission remained heavily engaged in the
settlement process on the ground through the shuttle
diplomacy conducted by the Head of the Mission and
by bringing technology to the mediation table. Over
the past year, the Mission facilitated 14 online and

MANDATE FACILITATION
The OSCE Mission to Moldova facilitates a

of the Transdniestrian conflict in all its aspects,
consolidating the independence, sovereignty and
territorial integrity of the Republic of Moldova within its
internationally recognized borders with a special status
for Transdniestria that fully guarantees the human,
political, economic and social rights of its population.

13 offline meetings of experts from working groups,
as well as between the two Chief Negotiators, and
supported the Sides in developing and coordinating
the effect of joint crisis response measures.
By continuing dialogue amid the pandemic, the Sides
followed a results-oriented approach and managed
to consolidate some of the confidence-building gains
achieved in previous years. The five agreements from the
“Berlin-plus” package of confidence-building measures
continued to be implemented, while a mechanism for the
participation of vehicles from Transdniestria in international
road traffic was extended in September 2020 for another
two years.
Despite some disagreements, the Sides remained
committed to a pragmatic approach to the negotiations,
which will serve as a basis for advancing the settlement
process in the next year and in mitigating the
consequences of the pandemic on the lives of the people
on both banks of the Dniester/Nistru.

FACILITATING FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT FOR
PUPILS AND TEACHERS FROM LATIN-SCRIPT
SCHOOLS
Since the beginning of the pandemic, teachers from
Moldova-administered Latin-script schools have crossed
the internal boundary line in the Security Zone with their
school buses once per month. They come to the right bank
to withdraw their salaries from cash machines. Every month
the OSCE Mission teams monitor each crossing of the
checkpoints by the schools buses.
Monitoring of the freedom of movement in the Security
Zone became one of the Mission’s top priorities in 2020.
Pandemic-related travel restrictions imposed by the
Transdniestrian side limited access on the part of ordinary
people to some basic services, which were otherwise
available only on the right bank. In this regard, coordination of activities and mutually agreeable solutions
between the two Sides was the cornerstone of the
Mission’s mediation efforts.

Schimbator)

Likewise, the Mission’s mediation efforts included
facilitation of the freedom of movement for the over
1,500 pupils from Latin-script schools ahead of the new
academic year. Located in Transdniestria, these schools
teach in the Latin script and use the school curriculum
of the Republic of Moldova. Just over 240 pupils need to
cross checkpoints in order to access their schools. Starting
from 1 September, the Mission teams closely monitored
the situation near the checkpoints and school premises,
observing that pupils could cross the internal boundary line
and start their school year without hindrance.
The good-faith co-operation between the Sides and the
Mission’s continuous monitoring of the Security Zone
enabled the schools to resume their activities as planned.
Freedom of movement for pupils and teachers is one of
the principles the Sides agreed on in the confidencebuilding measure on the functioning of the Latin-script
schools, signed in 2017 as part of the settlement process.

Chief Monitor: Ambassador Yaşar Halit Çevik
Budget: €108,9 million for the mandate period from 1 April 2020 to 31 March 2021
(€91,5 million from assessed contributions and €17,4 million from extrabudgetary
contributions). Total expenditure as of 31 December 2020 is €73,6 million, including
€6,8 million extrabudgetary actual expenditure.

The OSCE Special Monitoring Mission (SMM) to Ukraine is an unarmed civilian mission
that was deployed in March 2014. Operating 24/7, the Mission’s main effort and impact
is in the field: it employs over 1,017 staff in ten monitoring teams throughout the country
and 279 staff in the Head Office in Kyiv. The SMM’s mandate includes establishing facts,
gathering information and reporting on the security situation throughout Ukraine with
the aim of contributing to reduce tension and fostering peace, stability and security. The
SMM also monitors and supports respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms,
including the rights of national minorities, and it facilitates dialogue on the ground.
MONITORING IN EASTERN UKRAINE DURING
THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC
Throughout the year, the SMM continued to implement its
mandate while taking all necessary COVID-19 mitigation
measures to minimize risk to the safety and security of its
staff and of the communities in which they work.

MONITORING OF CIVILIAN LIVES ALONG THE
CONTACT LINE
The SMM also continued to monitor the impact of the
conflict on civilians, whose lives were additionally affected
by measures implemented on both sides of the contact
line in the context of the COVID-19 outbreak.

As has been the case with all monitoring teams across
Ukraine, the SMM continued patrolling and monitoring
in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions – with a temporarily
reduced footprint and prioritized tasks due to strict
COVID-19 mitigation measures – to fulfil the broad
spectrum of the SMM's mandated activities, and notably
to help support the TCG 22 July 2020 agreement on
measures to strengthen the ceasefire.

Amid the pandemic, all five entry–exit checkpoints (EECPs)
and the corresponding checkpoints of armed formations,
through which thousands of civilians would ordinarily cross
the contact line every day, were closed between the end
of March and the beginning of July. During this period,
civilians found themselves stranded at times on one side
of the contact line or the other; only a few were allowed to
cross for humanitarian reasons.

The SMM continued to use remote observation
technology, including cameras, unmanned aerial vehicles
and acoustic sensors.

Since July, civilians have only been able to cross the
contact line at two locations: at the EECP near Stanytsia
Luhanska and its corresponding checkpoint south of the
Stanytsia Luhanska bridge in the Luhansk region, and
at the EECP near Novotroitske and its corresponding
checkpoint near Olenivka in the Donetsk region, with
the latter operating only twice a week. As a result, the
number of civilian crossings registered at all EECPs
dropped by 92 per cent in the period from March to
November 2020 compared with the same period of 2019.
Also, since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, the
Mission has received about 1,280 requests from civilians
seeking support to cross the contact line for a variety of
reasons, mostly to return home, to visit sick relatives or
to access urgently needed medical services. The Mission
has referred these requests to relevant international
organizations such as the United Nations Office for the
Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) and the ICRC
and the TCG’s Working Group on Humanitarian Issues for
further action.

In 2020, the Mission recorded 134,783 ceasefire violations,
compared with 299,633 in 2019. The 55 per cent
reduction is attributable to the 22 July agreement, which
entered into force on 27 July. The ceasefire is now the
longest-lasting and most successful since the beginning of
the conflict in 2014.
The Chief Monitor continued to participate in online TCG
meetings in his capacity as Co-ordinator of the Working
Group on Security Issues (WGSI). The ceasefire, new
disengagement areas and mine action as indicated in
the negotiations of the Normandy Four format were the
WGSI’s main agenda items.
Despite the improvements cited above, in 2020 the
security environment in eastern Ukraine remained
challenging. The Mission maintained continuous and
robust risk management by carefully assessing each
operational activity, while holding regular security briefs
and issuing advisories to its staff.

based primarily on humanitarian criteria, the Special
Representative of the OSCE Chairperson-in-Office in
Ukraine and in the TCG released a press statement,
after a TCG meeting on 22 July 2020, noting that the
sides had reconfirmed their readiness to open the
Shchastia and Zolote crossing points in the Luhansk
region simultaneously, no later than 10 November. On
10 November, the SMM observed that the Shchastia
and Zolote entry–exit checkpoints were open to civilians;
however, the corresponding checkpoints of the armed
formations remained closed.
The conflict continued to take its toll on the civilian
population. In 2020, the Mission corroborated 128 civilian
casualties, including 17 children and 23 fatalities. Three
civilian casualties due to shelling were confirmed following
the measures to strengthen the ceasefire that entered into
force on 27 July. Twenty-seven civilians, mostly men, were
killed or injured by mines and other explosive devices,
highlighting the fact that even if the number of ceasefire
violations diminished significantly, the lives of civilians
would still be threatened.
The Mission deployed 11,616 patrols in the Donetsk and
Luhansk regions in 2020 and facilitated 1,573 “windows
of silence” – localized adherence to the ceasefire – to
enable repairs to and maintenance of 119 critical civilian
infrastructure facilities benefitting millions of civilians on
both sides of the contact line.
CENTRAL AND WESTERN UKRAINE DURING
THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC
The SMM continued to implement its mandate throughout
Ukraine in an adjusted operational posture due to the
pandemic. The Mission’s eight monitoring teams in central
and western Ukraine continued to monitor, among other
things, the security situation, respect for human rights and
fundamental freedoms and the situation of minorities and
internally displaced persons. Teams also monitored the
impact of, and reaction to, decisions and policies adopted

by the government in order to gather information and to
monitor the security situation throughout Ukraine, freedom
of the media and expression, and mandate-related
high-profile court cases.
GENDER MAINSTREAMING
The Mission continued to integrate a gender perspective
across its activities, with special attention to its monitoring
and reporting. As an early response to the COVID-19
pandemic and the social distancing measures introduced,
the SMM provided online access for all OSCE staff to
its awareness-raising and internal capacity-building
activities in the area of gender mainstreaming, including
by delivering a webinar series reaching over 750 Mission
members. The SMM also marked the “16 Days of Activism
against Gender-Based Violence” and the 20th anniversary
of UNSCR 1325 on Women, Peace and Security with a
series of activities for both internal and external audiences.
PUBLIC COMMUNICATION
From late March onwards, strict mitigation measures
related to the COVID-19 outbreak meant that outreach
activities were provided online. Starting from April, the
Mission carried out 32 online presentations to raise
awareness of the SMM’s role, activities and objectives,
responded to 84 press queries and issued six press
releases. Public engagement continued on the SMM
section of the OSCE website and through social media,
specifically on Twitter (30,400 followers) and Facebook
(19,200 followers), featuring, among other things, the
Mission’s bimonthly status reports. The Mission launched
Women on the Contact Line, a book presenting 15 profiles
of women – community leaders and Monitoring Officers
contributing to sustainable peace and to building bridges
between communities – from both sides of the contact
line. The publication, available online in English, Russian
and Ukrainian, had reached over 100,000 people by
31 December. The Mission previously shared these
15 stories through its social media channels, reaching
about 500,000 people.

TAISIIA AND THE DONETSK FILTRATION STATION
When the conflict first came to Taisiia’s hometown of Yasynuvata, in the Donetsk region, in the summer of 2014, her daily
commute to work became perilous, but the 31-year-old engineer thought it would all be over in a few days. Taisiia is a lab
technician at the Donetsk Filtration Station (DFS), a vital civilian infrastructure facility located in the middle of an area that has
regularly been the scene of some of the most intense fighting over the years. Today, she still finds herself making the same
journey to the lab, but SMM patrols make that journey safer.
The DFS is a key supplier of potable water, but firing positions are located within a couple of hundred metres of the facility,
placing it and its workers, including Taisiia, in the line of fire. During some exchanges, bullets and mortar shells have hit the
plant directly. Since 2014, the SMM has been facilitating daily localized adherence to the ceasefire –
“windows of silence” – to ensure safe passage for Taisiia and her colleagues to the DFS and a regular supply of clean drinking
water for hundreds of thousands of people on both sides of the contact line.
Even as the pandemic began to take its toll, the operation of the DFS and other critical civilian infrastructure remained vital for
the Mission because it is a priority for Taisiia and thousands more who depend on it.

COVID-19 TASK FORCE
The SMM’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic began in March 2020 as the crisis began to take hold. The Chief Monitor
established a COVID-19 Task Force at the SMM Head Office to immediately develop policies and to begin to provide him
with advice and recommendations to monitor, prevent, contain and mitigate the spread of the coronavirus among Mission
members.
Chaired by the Mission’s Chief of Staff, the task-force is a multidisciplinary co-ordination body, whose members are drawn
from senior management and all Head Office units, with regular engagement from the management of monitoring teams in
the field.
The Task Force enabled a co-ordinated SMM approach, anchoring responses through scenario-based policy coordination; close collaboration and consideration of the multifaceted effects of the pandemic on operations, administration,
security and the physical and mental health of staff; and communication needs. Responses included issuing a package
of early (in the first week) guidance on COVID-19 response measures and co-ordinating the development and regular
review of a series of protocols, including the SMM’s medical emergency response plan, rules on quarantine/self-isolation,
case reporting and testing, office protocols, sourcing and distribution of COVID-19 protective equipment for all staff
and security advisories. The Task Force kept Mission members informed through internal newsletters and updates. The
Task Force also ensured continuous SMM intranet communication regarding the Mission’s COVID-19 response across
all disciplines. It also facilitated the establishment of an ad hoc movement control mechanism to ensure the safe duty
transport of Mission members within Ukraine, and it proactively conducted table-top medevac exercises with monitoring
teams together with the OSCE medical evacuation provider. The lessons learned from the latter exercise were shared with
the OSCE Secretariat for the benefit of the entire Organization.

Budget: €3,618,500 (Unified budget), €2,204,136 (Extrabudgetary actual expenditure)
Staff: 4 international, 97 local
www.osce.org/project-coordinator-in-ukraine

The OSCE Project Co-ordinator’s main focus in 2020 was overcoming pandemic
difficulties to continue its support to Ukraine’s efforts to deal with security challenges. By
moving most of its operations to online and remote work in early spring, the Co-ordinator
managed to support progress in a wide array of spheres, such as ensuring environmental
and chemical security, enhancing the framework for humanitarian demining, promoting
good practices for civil society organizations and self-regulation for higher standards of
journalism, continuing dialogue on judicial reforms, raising the awareness of stakeholders
of constitutional justice principles and supporting trial monitoring for child-friendly
justice, among other areas.
HELPING TO ADDRESS DOMESTIC VIOLENCE
DURING LOCKDOWNS
As Ukraine imposed a nationwide lockdown in late March
to curb the first wave of COVID-19, in April the OSCE
Project Co-ordinator produced and sent to the regions of
Ukraine 2,000 posters warning of higher risks of trafficking
in human beings, cybercrime and domestic violence. The
posters, placed in the offices of social service providers,
contained useful information on where victims of the
above-mentioned crimes could get help. Governmental
and non-governmental hotlines registered an increase in
calls for help in domestic violence cases, making both
the warning and further assistance provided by the OSCE
highly relevant. In 2020, the Co-ordinator completed a
three-year endeavour to train personnel for the “102”
police emergency hotline to deal with such calls. In total,
830 operators and dispatchers from across the country
learned how to identify and assist people suffering from
domestic abuse. In addition to earlier practical training
programmes for patrol police officers, the Co-ordinator
produced and handed over to police training institutions
an online course for cadets. The Co-ordinator also held
nine three-day training sessions for 170 psychologists
from across the country on the organization and

implementation of a corrective programme for abusers.
This year also capped a multi-year effort to cover all the
regions of the country with such training. In addition, new
versions of a manual and a workbook on the organization
of corrective programmes were produced and published.
As part of a systemic response to the problem, the
Co-ordinator contributed to the “16 Days of Activism
against Gender-Based Violence” campaign, which focuses
on promoting responses to violence at home in view
of pandemic challenges. The Co-ordinator’s campaign
included a press tour for journalists with visits to police
training institutions and social services, as well as posts on
social media and work with opinion leaders.

LOCAL ELECTIONS AMID PANDEMIC RISKS
The pandemic coincided with the conduct of local
elections countrywide for new administrative and territorial
divisions on 25 October 2020. The decentralization reform
established new communities with much broader powers
for officials, so election-related education efforts took
on special importance. With face masks and sanitizers
provided for safety, the Co-ordinator organized 288
community meetings across the country in the

-----------------------Page 81 End-----------------------

pre-electoral period in October. “‘What is the right way to
wear that mask – with the blue- or the white-coloured side
facing in?’ was among the easier questions we received.
Others ranged from how to fill in the new ballot papers to
what changes decentralization [would bring] to communities”,
said Tetiana Kavalchuk, an activist from the NGO
Committee of Voters of Ukraine, who travelled across the
central regions of the country for the community meetings.
As the electoral legislation was amended recently, the
Co-ordinator’s Vyborkom online training tool for election
commissioners was in high demand. Also, for the first time
in the country’s history, a special application – a chatbot
for Facebook and Telegram developed by the
Co-ordinator – referred voters and candidates to a
wide range of questions, including on issues such as
the addresses of polling stations, voting procedures,
COVID-19 safety measures on election day and even the
voting results.
E-governance tools gained new importance in 2020.
A conference system provided by the Project Co-ordinator
enabled the Central Election Commission to stream their
meetings online with no need for election participants,
observers or the media to be physically present. The
online e-cabinet, another e-governance tool developed
by the Co-ordinator, helped the territorial commissions to
perform their duties by simplifying the challenging task of
aggregating voting data and establishing election results.
PROMOTING QUALITY LEGAL EDUCATION
Ukraine’s Ministry of Education and Science approved
new requirements for a master’s degree programme in
law. Developed with the assistance of the Co-ordinator,
the programme will start in the 2020/2021 academic year.
The new educational standard lists the competencies that
the students enrolled in the programme should obtain
and sets criteria for the evaluation of law faculties in the
process of certification of universities and their educational
programmes. On average, over 7,000 students graduate
annually from Ukraine’s universities with a Master of
Laws degree, so the standard will contribute to improving
the quality of education for a new generation of legal
professionals in the country. To promote standards-

Observer
Mission at
the Russian
Checkpoints
Gukovo and
Donetsk

Chief Observer: Ambassador György Varga
Budget: €1,404,400 (for the period from 1 February 2020 to 31 January 2021)
Staff: 21 observers, 2 Vienna-based staff (Chief of Fund Administration and
Administrative/Finance Assistant)
www.osce.org/observer-mission-at-russian-checkpoints-gukovo-and-donetsk

For its seventh consecutive year, the Observer Mission (OM) continued to fulfil its
mandate at the two Russian border checkpoints (BCPs) of Gukovo and Donetsk. During
2020, especially under COVID-19 conditions, which posed a number of challenges for the
OM’s everyday activities, the Mission, despite its small size and limited observation area,
was able to fulfil its mandate and maintained its capability of being continuously present
at the two aforementioned BCPs, keeping the OSCE participating States informed about
movement across the border.

Since its inception, the Mission has carried out its activities
based on a mandate that tasked the OSCE international
observers with “monitoring and reporting on the situation
at the checkpoints of Gukovo and Donetsk, as well as on
the movements across the border”.
The OM follows the principles of impartiality and
transparency in conducting its activities, with the aim
of providing the participating States with information
and facts relevant to the crisis in and around Ukraine by
observing the situation and movements across the border
at the two BCPs. The Mission’s reports represent a unique
and reliable source of information on movements across
border at the checkpoints of Gukovo and Donetsk as part
of the overall international effort aimed at fostering stability
and security in the region. Originally issued in English,
these reports have also been distributed in Russian since
July 2017. During the last year, the Mission also issued
five spot reports concerning Russian convoys bound
for Ukraine consisting of trucks bearing the inscription
“Humanitarian aid from the Russian Federation” (in
Russian). The OSCE Permanent Council extended the
mandate of the Observer Mission until 31 January 2021.
As of 2018, following a decision of the OSCE Permanent
Council, the duration of the Mission’s mandate was
extended to four months instead of three.

The Mission continues to implement a 24-hour shift
system at the two border checkpoints and is currently
working with 22 observers – including the Chief
Observer – seconded from 15 participating States.
CONTACTS WITH RUSSIAN AUTHORITIES
AND THE MEDIA
The Observer Mission has continued to strengthen its
working relations with the authorities present at both
border checkpoints, as well as with the Rostov Regional
Administration and the Rostov representative office of the
Foreign Ministry of the Russian Federation, and with local
authorities in Kamensk-Shakhtinsky, including the mayor
and representatives of the security and safety services.
In response to the COVID-19 situation, the Chief Observer
maintained close co-operation with the representatives of
the local hospital and the Chief State Sanitary Physician
of the Russian Federation — the authority responsible
for epidemiological control — to ensure co-ordination
of COVID-19 preventive measures and to mitigate their
impact on the Mission’s activity. Thanks to good
co-operation and the OM’s participation in the OSCE
donation campaign in response to the COVID-19 crisis,
the local hospital was the beneficiary of a small donation
aimed at providing personal protective equipment for the
medical staff.
Due to COVID-19 restrictions, fewer official meetings took
place, with the exception of regular visits to the Regional
Representation of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in
Rostov-on-Don. With other actors, the Chief Observer
maintained working contacts remotely in the majority of
cases.
The Observer Mission also continued to engage with
representatives from local and regional newspapers
in order to help the local population gain a better
understanding of the Mission’s mandate and its role in
addressing the crisis in and around Ukraine.

OBSERVATION TRENDS
In 2020, due to COVID-19 restrictions, overall traffic at
the two BCPs significantly decreased. Responding to
the pandemic, the host country closed its borders for the
majority of foreigners from 18 March 2020. The Mission’s
observer teams noted a decrease in the number of people
in military-style outfits crossing at the two checkpoints
compared with 2019. The number of passenger cars
crossing the border decreased as well throughout the
year, while the number of trucks slightly increased. The
average number of cross-border movements by people
increased a little during the summer.

Budget: €1,661,200 (Unified budget), €164,580(Extrabudgetary actual expenditure)
Staff: 6 international, 23 local
www.osce.org/centre-in-ashgabat

The OSCE Centre in Ashgabat remained active as ever in 2020 despite COVID-19
restrictions. To do this, the Centre moved its events online and launched additional
activities involving remote work on the part of experts. The Centre implemented projects
on preventive diplomacy, and border management; trade and transport facilitation, and
environmental protection; rule of law and media reform; and it placed special emphasis on
measures to prevent COVID-19 and to address the consequences of the global pandemic
across different spheres. The Centre worked with Turkmenistan’s institutions to strengthen
their capacity in areas such as controlling strategic goods, ensuring good governance,
promoting water management and ecologic protection in the oil and gas sector,
enhancing the Ombudsperson’s Office, implementing the National Human Rights Action
Plan for 2016–2020 and strengthening the criminal justice and penitentiary systems. The
Centre’s activities fostered the host government’s ownership in building the capacity of
border and police officials, enhancing energy efficiency and promoting the freedom of the
journalistic profession. The Centre’s experts prepared and revised strategic documents,
legislative commentaries and training modules on the following issues: money laundering,
terrorist financing and corruption, foreign investments, renewable energy and energy
diplomacy, the digital transformation of the media and freedom of expression.
PROMOTING PREVENTIVE DIPLOMACY
INSTRUMENTS
The constructive role of neutral states in conflict prevention
was the focus of online lectures for future diplomats that
the Centre organized to celebrate the 25th anniversary
of Turkmenistan’s permanent neutrality status. A highlevel career diplomat from Italy and a prominent professor
from the Netherlands lectured over 60 students and
teachers from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs’ Institute of
International Relations and from the International University
for the Humanities and Development in Turkmenistan.
The lectures introduced future diplomats to the history
of neutrality and security of small states, as well as the
evolution of European security following the Cold War.
They highlighted the nature of preventive diplomacy and
negotiation, the value of neutrality and the OSCE’s role in
addressing protracted conflicts.
“One of the pillars of Turkmenistan’s neutrality is preventive
diplomacy, which enhances the country’s valued
contribution to stability and sustainable development in
the region and beyond”, said Natalya Drozd, Head of the
OSCE Centre in Ashgabat, in the context of one of the
lectures. “As the OSCE is a primary instrument for conflict
prevention and resolution, we organized this event to
emphasize the opportunities of neutral states for resolving
disputes and preventing conflicts at early stages.”
Lectures and seminars on preventive diplomacy have
become a traditional part of the Centre’s co-operation
with the host country. Their purpose is to contribute to the
enhancement of the professional skills of those embarking
on a career in diplomacy.

NATIONAL TRAINERS READY TO DELIVER
TRAINING ON JOURNALISTS’ RIGHTS AND
DUTIES
Nine journalists and lawyers will join a pool of national
experts as a result of an advanced online train-thetrainer course on the rights and duties of journalists.
Future trainers will include media professionals and
representatives of the Bar Association, the Supreme
Court of Turkmenistan and the Institute of State, Law and
Democracy.

(Turkmen State Energy Institute in Mary)

“The opening of the CEST, with the OSCE Centre’s support,
is a very important event for us, primarily in the context of
studying world trends in the energy sphere, researching
the integration of renewable energy, including the launch
of the renewable energy portal for information exchange,
developing research and innovative programmes on energy
saving for different sectors of the economy, as well as
capacity-building and awareness-raising.”
The Centre opened the CEST to support the
implementation of the National Programme for Energy
Saving 2018–2024, an important initiative on the part
of Turkmenistan that demonstrates its commitment to
promoting energy efficiency. The opening of the CEST
marked a new milestone in the successful long-term
co-operation between the OSCE Centre and the TSEI,
illustrated by various joint activities addressing energy
diplomacy, alternative energy and other topics. Events held
in 2020 included a webinar on net energy consumption as
a new ecological and energy-saving system.
The CEST is expected to enhance the sustainability of
the OSCE Centre’s activities in support of Turkmenistan’s
efforts to promote energy efficiency and security.

The training of trainers is organized as part of the Centre’s
support for the implementation of the National Human
Rights Action Plan for 2016–2020, which envisaged
training on the rights and duties of journalists for court
workers, lawyers and journalists. Delivered by experts from
Kyrgyzstan and the United Kingdom, the course enhanced
the participants’ knowledge of international agreements
and legislation on freedom of expression, professional
standards for the work of journalists and the legal and
social status of journalists. Future trainers learned
a training and planning methodology and practised
designing and delivering training sessions.
“The implementation of OSCE projects addressing various
issues of media freedom and development moved OSCE–
Turkmenistan co-operation to a new level”, said Irina
Imamkuliyeva, an editor at the Neytralniy Turkmenistan
newspaper. “The training of the first national experts on the
rights and duties of journalists will step up our joint efforts
aimed at the practical implementation of international
standards and OSCE commitments in the national media
sector.”
International experts also designed a module for a training
course on the rights and duties of journalists that future
trainers will use when delivering training courses for their
peers.
The newly trained trainers are expected to take the lead
in further promoting awareness of international standards
pertaining to freedom of the journalistic profession.

KYRGYZSTAN ON THE PATH TO
DIGITALIZATION
The Programme Office has been closely co-operating with
the Electronic Interoperability Center – Tunduk state enterprise
by providing comprehensive expert and technical assistance
to support the host country’s digitalization efforts. Tunduk
is the central system for digitizing access to public services
and connecting state structures to one another. Tunduk
includes a unified identification system – a platform that
enables all citizens of Kyrgyzstan to access the electronic
portals of public service providers through a secure method
of user authorization. With the Programme Office’s support,
Tunduk will substantially decrease the number of bureaucratic
procedures, cutting red tape and minimizing risks of corrupt
practices, while increasing the efficiency of government,
thereby making it easier for the population to receive public
services, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic.
SUPPORTING ENTREPRENEURSHIP IN
KYRGYZSTAN
The Programme Office supports the development of small
and medium-sized enterprises through Entrepreneurship
Support Centres (ESCs). Currently, five ESCs in the cities
of Batken, Jalal-Abad, Karakol, Osh and Talas, are being

WOMEN’S EMPOWERMENT DURING COVID-19
The Women Initiative Groups (WIGs) is an informal grassroots network of active women leaders who come
together to address social problems in their communities,
including conflict prevention and resolution, gender-based
violence and local issues related to COVID-19. It also
promotes the principles of UN Security Council Resolution
1325 on Women, Peace and Security, as well as increased
women’s participation in political and public life.
Since 2011 the WIGs have expanded their network. Today,
with the support of the Programme Office, the network is
truly national, with 28 WIGs in all provinces of the country.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, the WIGs collected
data through surveys on the impact of COVID-19 on
gender-based violence (GBV), after which they mapped
the most vulnerable groups and communities and
provided psychological support to victims. The WIGs also
distributed humanitarian aid, produced and distributed
personal protective equipment and raised awareness
about sanitary and hygiene measures. This was made
possible through the Programme Office’s expert and
technical support, including in monitoring and evaluating
the WIGs’ activities.

In 2020, the OSCE Programme Office in Dushanbe undertook sustained efforts to adjust
its operations to the challenging circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic and to carry
out planned programmatic activities.

PROMOTING COMMUNITY POLICING
The Programme Office has been contributing to
advancing community policing as a cornerstone of the
comprehensive police reform since 2011. The Ministry of
Internal Affairs (MIA) and the OSCE jointly implemented
activities aimed at building public trust and fostering cooperation between the police and citizens. Since 2018,
the Office has supported the Ministry of Internal Affairs of
Tajikistan in establishing model police stations (MPSs) in
the regions.
The first three locations to host MPSs were established in
Hissar, a famous tourist site; in Essaboy, a remote area;
and in Safeddara, a ski resort. The Deputy Interior Minister,
Major-General Ibrohimzoda Nozim, has been a driving
force in setting up the MPSs. “We hope that the established
model police station will help to build a close relationship with
the local population in order to create accountability and trust
between the police and civil society”, he said about
the project.
The community policing concept will be further
strengthened through the introduction of mobile police
receptions to ensure access to police services in
remote areas.

EFFORTS TO COMBAT COVID-19
The Office ensured a quick response to the host country’s
request to assist in preventing the spread of COVID-19.
Personal protective equipment and medical supplies were
provided to the Ministry of Health and Social Protection
and the Committee of Emergency Situations and Civil
Defence. Special attention was devoted to an information
campaign on COVID-19. The Office, together with UNICEF
and the WHO, distributed more than 250,000 leaflets on
WHO-recommended COVID-19 prevention and response
measures in the regions of the country, including remote
areas.
COMBATING DOMESTIC VIOLENCE
Preventing and combating violence against women is a
priority for the Office. It has supported the nationwide
network of 14 Women’s Resource Centres (WRCs),
which assist victims of domestic violence by providing
free psychosocial and legal counselling and vocational
skills training to facilitate financial independence. The
initiative promotes the implementation of international
commitments and national legislation aimed at eliminating
all forms of domestic violence. In 2020, despite challenges
related to COVID-19, all WRCs provided free psychosocial
and legal consultations to victims of domestic violence,

The digitalization of co-operation
and interaction between the local
business community and potential

regions with poor road infrastructure, where such services
are otherwise unavailable. In total, the WRCs provided
1,983 psychosocial and 2,184 legal support services to
918 clients.
BUILDING CAPACITY ON DISASTER
PREPAREDNESS
The lack of disaster and emergency risk management
capacity at the local level hampers the resilience of
communities. To help mitigate risks related to natural
hazards and to the current COVID-19 pandemic, the
Office and the Red Crescent Society of Tajikistan (RCST)
conducted 50 awareness-raising sessions for some 1,000
community members and capacity-building seminars for
members of 80 local disaster management committees.
The aim of the community-based approach to disaster
risk reduction is to reduce people’s vulnerabilities by
strengthening the capacities of individuals and families to
prepare and respond to natural disasters. It addresses
poverty, social inequalities, environmental resource
depletion and degradation, and the lack of reliable
information. For Umedali Sayduniev, Training Coordinator
at the RCST, capacity-building is key to building resilience

on preparedness towards disaster and emergency risk
reduction”.

THE BORDER MANAGEMENT STAFF COLLEGE
Since 1999, the Border Management Staff College (BMSC) has been the OSCE’s flagship regional project. Throughout
this period, the BMSC successfully delivered 171 specialized training courses and thematic events, including 27 onemonth intensive staff courses and three one-year postgraduate diploma courses in border security and management for
senior leadership for no fewer than 3,781 border security management officials (including 703 women) from 46 OSCE
participating states, 10 Partners for Co-operation and 6 non-OSCE countries. The BMSC successfully adjusted its
activities in 2020 to the pandemic circumstances and delivered its programmes in full using online, hybrid and face-to face
modalities.

Staff: 6 international, 22 local
www.osce.org/programme-office-in-nur-sultan

In 2020, the OSCE Programme Office in Nur-Sultan developed new innovative approaches
with institutions from government, civil society, academia, the private sector and the
international community to promote security in Kazakhstan and the Central Asia region. The
Office implemented creative solutions to engage stakeholders and the public to promote
media freedom, sustainable economic growth and good economic governance. It developed
new ways to engage youth and a special project to build capacity for the host country to
aid victims of domestic violence. The Office continued its extrabudgetary project on police
reform with support from the Government of Norway. In total, the Office implemented 98
events in all three security dimensions with over 3,000 participants nationwide.
ADAPTING TO NEW CHALLENGES
In response to restrictions and duty-of-care obligations, the
Office began conducting events virtually, working remotely
and advising partners and key stakeholders to do the same.
All personnel were given personal protective equipment
and advised to engage partners online to adapt project
implementation strategies where possible to address any
challenges that might arise in the host country as a result of
the pandemic.
COVID-19 AND ASSISTING VICTIMS OF
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE
In recognition of the increased rate of reported domestic
violence around the world during lockdowns, the Office
launched a special initiative to support crisis centres in eight
regions of the host country by providing additional premises
and hiring experts to render comprehensive assistance to
victims. Staff at the facilities were trained to identify victims
and to help them seek assistance from medical and state
experts. The Office also produced videos in Kazakh and
Russian to bring public attention to these issues and to

the role crisis centres play in addressing critical needs, in
particular for women and children.
PROTECTING BORDERS AND CYBERSPACE
The Office trained law enforcement officers from across
the country to combat transnational organized crime – in
particular, cybercrime – and provided portable devices to
help border guards verify the authenticity of travel documents.
Crisis reporting, information literacy and fact-checking were
the focus of the tenth Central Asian Internet Forum, which
brought together some 150 practitioners and experts from
the region and beyond through an online platform.
PROMOTING SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
PRACTICES
The Office continued its co-operation with Kazakhstan’s
Ecology, Geology and Natural Resources Ministry on followup legislation to the new Environmental Code to harmonize it
with the host country’s strategic documents and obligations
under the conventions of the United Nations Economic
Commission for Europe.

ENGAGING YOUTH FOR COMPREHENSIVE SECURITY
In line with the Albanian Chairmanship’s priority on fostering youth exchange and the political participation of young people, the
Office organized cross-dimensional activities that engaged over 250 young people regionally. The annual Central Asian Youth
Network (CAYN) held an alumni reunion together with the Programme Office in Bishkek for university students and CAYN alumni from
Central Asia, Afghanistan and Mongolia. It organized a Model OSCE conference in the nation’s capital, which introduced graduate
students and young professionals to the OSCE concept of comprehensive and co-operative security and its application to real-world
challenges. It organized the Central Asia Leadership Programme dedicated to the Year of the Volunteer in Kazakhstan as well as
online training seminars for young professionals and civil servants from Central Asia and Afghanistan on climate change mitigation.

GOOD ECONOMIC GOVERNANCE
In the area of good economic governance, the Office
focused on projects aimed at combating corruption, the
financing of terrorism and money laundering. It supported
both governmental and non-governmental partners
in raising awareness and addressing the OECD AntiCorruption Network’s recommendations for Kazakhstan
by implementing international standards.
HUMAN RIGHTS AND RULE OF LAW
The Office continued supporting efforts aimed at enhancing
human rights and fundamental freedoms by strengthening
the professional skills of diverse stakeholders and facilitating
dialogue on these issues. The Office hosted an online
discussion and a series of human rights–related awarenessraising and learning workshops held for local community
representatives as part of the “Newcomer Fest on Human
Rights”.
Through an extrabudgetary project on police reform and
with support from the Government of Norway, the Office
co-organized a series of training seminars on a serviceoriented approach in policing for faculty from five police
academies. The Office assisted the Interior Ministry
in developing guidelines for the work of district police
inspectors in the framework of this project.

EXPERT SUPPORT TO TACKLE
PYRAMID SCHEMES
Maxat Shagdarov, from the
Agency for Regulation and
Development of the Financial
Market of the Republic of
Kazakhstan, has seen firsthand how the OSCE can help:
“One of the problems that
countries have been facing lately
is countering financial pyramid
schemes. The OSCE Programme
Office in Nur-Sultan provided an
opportunity for our specialists
to learn so much about the principles of countering these
schemes.” He noted that the principles taught at OSCEsupported events help the Agency’s specialists in their daily
work: “It is especially important that there is an opportunity to
exchange experience and information directly with an expert
invited by the OSCE. The information that was presented
by the expert is presented in a simple and clear manner,
which contributes to a better assimilation of the material.”

A PARTNER FOR MEDIA FREEDOM
For Diana Okremova, Director of the Legal Media Centre (a
Kazakhstan-based non-governmental organization), the OSCE
has always been a reliable partner for the most important
regional events on media freedom and related legislation. “The
OSCE is a long-term partner in which you can be confident,”
she said. Okremova notes that much of her organization’s work
takes staff members around the country to train journalists and
human rights experts on relevant legislation and international
standards and that the OSCE has been instrumental in
providing political and financial support to her initiative: “The
Programme Office in Nur-Sultan can always be counted on to
help in relevant work in the rural regions of Kazakhstan, where
we discuss key details of changes in media legislation and law
enforcement practice. … In addition to knowing the key legal
issues related to freedom of the media, OSCE representatives
are always actively involved in our events in person and online.”

In 2020, the OSCE Project Co-ordinator in Uzbekistan (PCUz) continued to support the host
country’s efforts to address transnational threats, promote transparency in governance, fight
corruption, combat money laundering and counteract trafficking in human beings and drugs. In
addition, the PCUz helped to mitigate the worst effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the
spread of false information, its economic toll on women and the rise of domestic violence cases.

RESPONDING TO THE TRANSNATIONAL THREATS RELATED TO COVID-19 IN UZBEKISTAN
“At the outbreak of the pandemic, I held a few Vancouver/Tashkent Zoom meetings with PCUz staff during which we initially discussed
working from home to keep the staff safe and then carried on to how we could respond as an OSCE field operation. We found
ourselves focusing on the immediate needs of our project partners. The police on the streets of Tashkent who were enforcing ‘stay
at home’ measures were urgently in need of more protective equipment so that they could avoid becoming virus spreaders during
their necessary interaction with the public. The staff of the Ombudsperson institution were in need of protective equipment so that
they could continue their important work in monitoring closed institutions for women and juveniles, some of the most vulnerable in
society. The PCUz met the challenge, and within weeks we were able to procure the needed material and provide it to our partners.
Throughout our internal PCUz discussions on what our role should be in fighting the transnational threats related to
COVID-19, we considered that the safety of people and their health are part of the OSCE’s comprehensive approach to
security. This approach has been reflected in how the PCUz has responded to the COVID-19 crisis, and we are still finding
new ways to assist the government of Uzbekistan through adjusting our programmatic work to this new reality.”

A NEW TOOLKIT TO COUNTER THE COVID-19
INFODEMIC
The COVID-19 pandemic has created a new need for
scientific information and understanding of the novel
coronavirus. At the same time, there has been an increase
in false stories on social media and in the traditional media
– an alarming trend that has damaging effects on public
health efforts. Journalists are at the forefront of the fight
against misinformation, but time pressures and limited
resources can hamper their ability to sift through and
fact-check the overabundance of information about the
pandemic. To support Uzbekistan’s media professionals
in their fight against the infodemic, the PCUz launched a
toolkit that provides journalists and bloggers in Uzbekistan
with timely and accurate information from trusted sources.
It also includes a “Debunkers Database” that enables
media professionals to share exposed fake news. The
toolkit was developed in co-operation with the Public Fund
for the Support and Development of National Mass Media
and the Radio Nederland Training Centre and is available
in Uzbek, Russian and English.

Gulfiya is one of 80 beneficiaries who took part in one
of the PCUz’s activities. She attended training on how to
run an online culinary business. “For me, a single mother
with a disabled child, this programme provided a unique
opportunity to generate income while staying at home”,
she said. The programme, which pioneered an online
culinary market named Coozin, also helped Gulbakhor
to become a culinary entrepreneur. “The training was an
unprecedented possibility for me. I know now what to do
and how to run a business. It gave me confidence and
the impetus to start a culinary entreprise that will definitely
contribute to the financial stability of my family”, she noted.
A LINE OF HELP AMID THE COVID-19 CRISIS
The lockdown period proved to be a time of severe
financial, psychological and interpersonal challenges for
many families across the world, exacerbating existing
conflicts and revealing new problems. During the year,
hundreds of women all over Uzbekistan had to face
quarantine restrictions while dealing with housing
issues, job losses and domestic violence. Taking into
consideration the fact that they had no, or only limited,
opportunities to move around their places of residence,
citizens required alternative sources of assistance to
manage the issues they had to deal with. For many
survivors of violence, for example, the journey to safety
and healing could start with a simple phone call to one
of the specialized domestic violence hotlines. Together
with the NGO Civic Initiatives Support Centre (CISC),
the PCUz set up a hotline to provide information about
resources and services available in the country, as well
as access to free legal and psychological counselling for
women. “In response to the explosive growth in domestic
violence cases during the pandemic, the quickest, most
effective and safest way to help victims is through a hotline
assistance mechanism”, noted Dilovar Kabulova, Director
of the CISC. “Starting 1 May 2020, the working schedule
of our hotline was intense: during the first three months
of operations, the hotline performed its functions almost
on a round-the-clock basis with only five hours of break
daily”, she said. To date, hotline operators have arranged
more than 150 legal consultations and 230 psychological
consultations and processed 173 miscellaneous requests.

FIRST MODEL OSCE ORGANIZED IN UZBEKISTAN
A Model OSCE, the first of its kind in Uzbekistan,
was co-organized by the PCUz and the University
of World Economy and Diplomacy (UWED) in
Tashkent. Twenty-five graduates and current
students from UWED participated in the online event,
which was held from 2 to 4 September 2020.
The participants enhanced their knowledge of
OSCE structures, learned about the PCUz’s work
and developed their negotiation skills and their
skills for drafting international documents. Saodat
Radjapova, a graduate of the International Economics
Relations department at UWED, shared her views
on the event: “The Model OSCE enabled us to
upgrade our negotiation skills. During the Model, despite the fact that it was organized online due to the
pandemic, we could immerse ourselves in the atmosphere of diplomatic relations. I would also like to note that
solving crisis issues in order to reach a positive outcome is in practice not as simple as it might seem when
you look at it from the screen of your television or smartphone. This opportunity was truly eye-opening.”

Asian and
Mediterranean
Partners for
Co-operation

The OSCE continued its political dialogue and practical work with its five Asian
and six Mediterranean Partners for Co-operation. One of the focus areas of
their co-operation in 2020 was their common response to transnational threats
in the context of the current COVID-19-related global health crisis. Thematic
discussions included combating human trafficking; fighting corruption; countering
organized crime; promoting women, peace and security; and also embracing the
opportunities provided by new technologies to tackle transnational threats.

ASIAN PARTNERS FOR CO-OPERATION –
TECHNOLOGIES FOR COMPREHENSIVE
SECURITY
The use of innovation and technologies to confront
complex security challenges was the theme of two major
events held in the context of the OSCE Asian Partnership
in 2020.
The fourth interregional conference on the impact of
emerging technologies on international security and
terrorism was held on 14 October 2020 with a focus on
new technologies and their impact on international security
and terrorism while safeguarding human rights. The virtual
event, which was co-organized by the Foreign Affairs
Ministry of the Republic of Korea, the OSCE Transnational
Threats Department and the OSCE External Co-operation
Section, enabled an expert discussion on the development
and testing of weapons based on emerging technologies,
precautions needed to minimize risks to civilians and
compliance with international humanitarian and human
rights law.
On 9 and 10 November 2020, the OSCE Secretariat and
the OSCE Border Management Staff College in Dushanbe,
supported by Slovakia in its capacity as Chair of the OSCE
Asian Partners for Co-operation Group, jointly organized
a round-table discussion on the impact of the COVID-19
pandemic on border agencies’ operations. Experts
representing each of the OSCE Asian Partners for Cooperation discussed challenges related to the misuse of
technology for terrorist purposes and other transnational
crimes Representatives from international and regional
organizations and government agencies also presented
ideas for the innovative use of emerging technologies,
which included biometrics, advance passenger information
(API) and passenger name records (PNR) systems to help
address the cross-border movement of potential foreign
terrorist fighters and criminals, as well as the protection of
human rights when applying these technologies.
MEDITERRANEAN PARTNERS FOR
CO-OPERATION - JOINT RESPONSES
TO TRANSNATIONAL THREATS
Transnational organized crime is one of the most serious
threats to security and stability across the OSCE and
Mediterranean regions. The rapid adaptability of organized
crime groups and in particular their exploitation of the
global coronavirus pandemic have added to the urgency
of multilayered strategic co-operation. Jointly fighting
organized crime through strategic partnerships among law
enforcement agencies, national institutions, civil society
organizations and the private sector was therefore the
focus of an OSCE conference held in Vienna and online on
5 October 2010. More than 250 participants from OSCE

to an arms race and cause geopolitical instability.
The development of technologies raises concerns
of new ethical and legal standards, as seen in the
discussion on lethal autonomous weapons systems.
The COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically heightened
the urgency and importance of discussions on
emerging technologies. There are rising concerns about
widespread misinformation relevant to the pandemic

and experts from academia, civil society, the UN and other
international and regional organizations discussed the
main trends and challenges in the fight against organized
crime and presented concrete examples of responses they
have developed.
There was also a discussion about what more the OSCE
participating States and the Mediterranean Partners could
do to counter organized crime and illicit finance, such as
improving financial crime investigations and the recovery of
criminal assets.
The conference’s final session explored the link
between organized crime and cyber-enabled crime.
The participants examined the extent to which organized
crime groups use cyberspace to commit crimes such as
fraud and the trafficking of illicit drugs or weapons on the
dark web.
The outcomes of the discussions will help the
Transnational Threats Department identify the main and
common challenges in combating organized crime and
outline possible joint initiatives with OSCE participating
States and Partners for Co-operation.

the implementation of API/PNR systems. Following
requests for co-operation from the region, some 30
participants representing border guards, customs
services, national security services and police from
the six Partners attended the event. In a workshop
that lasted two and a half days, participants enhanced
their knowledge of the implementation of API/PNR
systems, including in the areas of legislation, technology,
finances, public–private partnerships, informationsharing negotiations and law enforcement partnerships.

Co-operation with international and
regional organizations
Due to the restrictions imposed because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the OSCE’s working
relations with other organizations shifted from their traditional face-to-face form to
online consultations and co-operation. Building on its well-established communication
channels and co-operation, the OSCE maintained its collaboration with a broad range
of regional and international organizations active in the politico-military, economic and
environmental, and human dimensions of security.

MOVING POLITICAL DIALOGUE ONLINE
Regular consultations between international organizations
at the political and working levels are an important part of
their co-operation arrangements: they serve to exchange
information and share good practices, and help to create
synergies and avoid duplication of their activities. Since inperson meetings could not be held during most of 2020,
interaction between the OSCE and other regional and
international organizations took place virtually. The OSCE
and the UN, for example, used online formats to maintain
their co-operation on several issues of mutual interest,
including conflict prevention and resolution; women, peace
and security; and youth, peace and security. Represented
by the Director of the OSCE Conflict Prevention Centre
and Deputy Head of the OSCE Secretariat, Ambassador
Tuula Yrjölä, the OSCE took part in the UN SecretaryGeneral’s interactive dialogue with heads of regional and
other organizations, dedicated to the multilateral response
to COVID-19. This event provided an opportunity to
highlight the OSCE’s efforts to implement its mandates
amid the pandemic and to support its participating States
in addressing the implications of COVID-19.
For the first time, a meeting of the Council of Europe–
OSCE Co-ordination Group was held online in May 2020.
Established in 2004, the Co-ordination Group reviews the
co-operation between the two organizations in agreed
priority areas. The meeting in 2020 was dedicated to the
protection of the rights of persons belonging to national
minorities.

2020 that brought together OSCE representatives and
the NATO 2030 Advisory Group to discuss challenges in
a changing security environment and to assess OSCE–
NATO co-operation.
OSCE events held online and in blended formats saw a
significant increase in participation by representatives
of other organizations, including at high political levels.
The 2020 Annual Security Review Conference, for
example, was attended by Sergey Lebedev, Chairman
of the Executive Committee of the Commonwealth of
Independent States, and Vladimir Norov, SecretaryGeneral of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation.
OSCE AND UNOCT: PASSENGER DATA
EXCHANGE
On 29 and 30 October 2020, the OSCE Transnational
Threats Department and the UNOCT held the fourth
“OSCE-wide Seminar on Passenger Data Exchange” –
this time in an online format. Some 300 passenger data
experts from participating States, countries representing
the Asian and Mediterranean Partners for Co-operation,
international organizations and the private sector took part
in the webinar.

Similarly, exchanges with the EU were held via video
teleconference (VTC). In a VTC held on 15 May 2020, the
Secretaries General and Directors of the OSCE and the
EU External Action Service exchanged information on the
COVID-19 crisis and the status of EU-funded and OSCEimplemented projects, and they spoke about ongoing
conflicts in the OSCE region, climate change and the
climate–security nexus.
With NATO, the OSCE held VTC meetings on topics
such as countering terrorism; cyber/ICT security;
medical evacuation; women, peace and security; and
their respective Mediterranean partnerships. The two
organizations also held an online meeting on 20 October

THE 2020–2022 OSCE–UNODC JOINT ACTION PLAN
In July 2020, the then-OSCE Secretary General, Thomas Greminger, and the Executive Director of the
UNODC, Ghada Fathi Waly, signed a plan of joint action for the period 2020–2022. It is the fifth edition of
the action plan, which formalized collaboration between the OSCE Secretariat and the UNODC in 2011.
The 2020–2022 OSCE–UNODC Joint Action Plan reflects the two organizations’ contributions to the United
Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and foresees greater co-ordination and the implementation
of joint programmes and activities. This includes co-ordination and co-operation through the exchange of best
practices, the organization of joint workshops, joint technical assistance and the sharing of resources in nine
subject areas, including combating transnational organized crime and corruption, preventing and countering violent
extremism leading to terrorism, combating trafficking in human beings, combating illicit drugs and cybercrime,
promoting security sector governance and reform, and implementing border security and management. The
action plan also envisages joint actions in advancing gender equality, crime prevention and youth engagement.

headquarters in Vienna, 17 July 2020. (OSCE)

The purpose of the event was to support states in
implementing UNSCR 2396. The Resolution was
developed to prevent the return of foreign terrorist
fighters by mandating that states adopt and use both
API and PNR data systems to check against national
and international watch lists of known and suspected
terrorists. Against the background of the coronavirus
pandemic, however, the seminar’s participants also
discussed how passenger data could be used to
identify and contact travellers who were exposed
to the disease while travelling and how it could help
the authorities in their efforts to address challenges
posed by COVID-19 while upholding human rights.

a Transboundary Context was developed to enhance
international co-operation on environmental matters and
thus to help avoid tensions that might lead to conflict.
It is often referred to as the Espoo Convention, after the
place in Finland where it was adopted in 1991. States
that choose to adhere to the Convention commit to
notify and consult one another on all major projects

THE ESPOO CONVENTION
Environmental challenges do not stop at state borders,
and issues such as air and land pollution, oil spills and
radiation must be tackled at an international level. The

under consideration on their territory that are likely to
have significant adverse effects on the environment
across boundaries. The Convention stipulates that
states carry out environmental impact assessments
of certain activities at an early stage of planning to
ensure that environmental implications are taken into
account. These assessments inform decision-making
and help to avoid or mitigate adverse impacts on the
environment. In addition, countries whose environment
might be affected by an activity have a say in shaping or
amending the activity.
The Espoo Convention also explicitly empowers citizens
to exercise their rights to access information and to
take part in environmental decision-making. The OSCE
and the UNECE therefore collaborated to publish an
illustrated booklet about the functioning and benefits of
the Convention. Published on the occasion of the 30th
anniversary of its adoption, the illustrations inform the
public about the spirit of the Espoo Convention and its role
in protecting the environment and promoting international
co-operation.
OSCE AND UNHCR: POOLING EXPERTISE TO
COUNTER HATE SPEECH
Anti-refugee and -migration rhetoric is typically
grounded in misguided and hateful narratives, which
assault the dignity and safety of those they attack and

complicate public debates about workable solutions.
Both the OSCE and the UNHCR are resolutely
committed to combating any type of hate speech,
including that targeting people on the move. Rational
argumentation and hard data are often not enough to
neutralize hateful assumptions, and changing migration
narratives require work with narrative shapers to appeal
to the audience’s emotions, and not least , to create a
non-discriminatory environment.
To identify ways to address the magnitude of hate speech
and its underlying causes together, the OSCE and the
UNHCR held a webinar on 3 July 2020 called “Combating
hate speech and toxic narratives about migrants and
refugees”. More than 40 OSCE and UNHCR staff working
in the fields of media, public information and external
relations met online to exchange their experiences with
educational approaches and tools that can undermine
hate-mongering narratives without silencing vulnerable
groups and disrupting reporting on the issue. Coming
from different backgrounds and working under different
mandates, the participants shared information about their
projects and campaigns. They also presented a multitude
of guidance documents, survey findings, analyses and
assessment and training tools.
The two organizations will continue to join forces on this
important topic and analyse where they can consolidate
their messages and advocacy efforts.

UPGRADING THE OSCE–UNHCR PARTNERSHIP: A NEW ADDENDUM
TO THE 1998 MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING
Co-operation between the OSCE and the UNHCR goes back to 1998, when the OSCE Secretary General, Giancarlo Aragona, and the
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, Sadako Ogata, signed the first memorandum of understanding (MoU) between the
two organizations. Since then, the OSCE and the UNHCR have worked together to address forced displacement and related issues
throughout the conflict cycle. On 4 March 2020, the then-OSCE Secretary General, Thomas Greminger, and the United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees, Filippo Grandi, signed an addendum to the first MoU. The new agreement reinforces the co-operation
between the two organizations to better protect persons of concern to the UNHCR in the OSCE’s three dimensions of security,
including the human rights of people on the move, the fight against trafficking in human beings and border security and management.
