A.     INTRODUCTION
I.     Preliminary Remarks
1.     On behalf of the Commission and the other African Union (AU) Organs and
Specialized Agencies, I have the honour, as the Chairperson of the Commission, to
present the Annual Report on the Activities of the Union and Its Organs for the
period of January to December 2019, pursuant to the decision of the Executive Council
EX.CL./Dec.943(XXX) of January 2017.

2.     During the year under review, in addition to their own mandated activities, the
Commission and other AU Organs and Specialized Agencies were fully engaged in
assisting Member States in the implementation of the Union’s Agenda 2063 and, in
particular, the flagship projects identified under the First Ten-Year Implementation
Plan (FTYIP) and the Medium Term Plan 2018-2023 (MTP), as adopted by the
Executive Council in June 2018 [EX.CL./Dec.1008(XXXIII)].

II.    Highlights of Activities and Main Achievements
3.     This section highlights some of the key results achieved and other issues
addressed by the Commission and other Organs and institutions in 2019, especially
with regard to the Agenda 2063 flagship projects.

4.      The Commission finalized the draft Commodity Strategy which identified the
following four strategic pillars: (i) commodity markets and pricing; (ii) linkages and
diversification; (iii) governance and enabling environment; and (iv) skills development
and research and development. The pillars will help guide the optimal use of African
commodities to attain value addition, sustainable industrialization, economic
diversification, structural transformation, development and enhanced trade. This Draft

yet done so. The Commission is engaging that country towards the signing and
ratification of the Agreement accordingly. The 12th Extraordinary Session of the AU

provides a status report on their implementation during the period January to
December 2019.

   I.      African Commodity Strategy

26.     In 2019, the Commission finalized the development of the Draft AU Commodity
Strategy that addresses challenges in three main commodities sectors, namely:
agriculture, mining, and energy. The draft Strategy also identifies the following four
strategic pillars: (i) commodity markets and pricing; (ii) linkages and diversification; (iii)
governance and enabling environment; and (iv) skills development and research and
development. The pillars will help guide the optimal use of African commodities to
attain value addition, sustainable industrialization, economic diversification, structural
transformation, development and enhanced trade.

27.    The Draft Commodity Strategy was presented to the 2nd Meeting of the STC
on Trade, Industry and Mining in January 2019. It recommended that further
consultations be carried out to address the observations and recommendations.
Consequently, the Commission convened a meeting of experts in Addis Ababa from
25 to 28 November 2019 whose outcomes were to be presented to an extraordinary
STC of Ministers of Trade, Industry and Minerals for final consideration and adoption
in December 2019.

   II.     African Continental Free Trade Area

28.    Following the signing of the Agreement establishing the African Continental
Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) in March 2018, in Kigali, and subsequent work to finalize
its accompanying protocols, the June-July 2018 AU Summit in Nouakchott gave
further guidance. It directed the AU Ministers responsible for Trade to complete all
outstanding work on Phase 1 negotiations and submit the outcomes to the Assembly
at the January-February 2019 Summit. This includes (i) the Schedules of Specific
Commitments on Trade in Services; (ii) the finalization of Annex 1 of the Protocol on
Trade in Goods dealing with the Schedules of Tariff Concessions; and (iii) the Annexes
on Trade Remedies and Rules of Origin. The Assembly also directed that Phase 2
negotiations related to investment, intellectual property rights and competition policy
be concluded by January 2020.

29.     The AfCFTA Agreement came into effect on 30th May 2019, which was 30 days
after the deposit of the 22nd instrument of ratification. As of 1 November 2019, fifty-
four (54) African Union Member States had signed the Agreement. Only Eritrea is yet
to do so. The Commission is engaging with the Eritrean Government towards the
signing and ratification of the Agreement accordingly.

30.     As of 1 November 2019, the following twenty-eight (28) countries had deposited
their instruments of ratification with the Commission, hence became State Parties:
Burkina Faso, Chad, Republic of Congo, Côte d’Ivoire, Djibouti, Egypt, Eswatini,
Equatorial Guinea, Ethiopia, Gabon, The Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Kenya, Mali,
Mauritania, Mauritius, Namibia, Niger, Rwanda, Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic,
São Tomé and Príncipe, Senegal, Sierra Leone, South Africa, Togo, Uganda, and
Zimbabwe.

                                                                             EX.CL/1214(XXXVI)
                                                                                        Page 7


31.   The 12th Extraordinary Session of the AU Assembly held in July 2019, in
Niamey, Niger, launched the operational phase of the AfCFTA. The Agreement is
supported by the following instruments: the agreed AfCFTA Rules of Origin;
Dashboard of the AU Trade Observatory; AfCFTA Trade in Goods Password
Protected Dashboard; Pan-African Payments and Settlements System; and The
Online Mechanism for Reporting, Monitoring and Elimination of Non-Tariff Barriers.

32.          In addition, the 12th Extraordinary Session of the Assembly decided as follows:

             a) the AfCFTA would be hosted by Ghana;
             b) Final schedules of Tariff Concessions and outstanding Rules of Origin for
                the AfCFTA, be submitted to its February 2020 Ordinary Summit;
             c) Dismantling of tariffs should start not later than 1 July 2020, to allow the start
                of trading within the AfCFTA Regime on the same day;
             d) the Interim AfCFTA Secretariat should organize the inaugural meeting of
                the AfCFTA Council of Ministers not later than 31 October 2019;
             e) the Commission should ensure that the AfCFTA Secretariat is operational
                no later than 31 March 2020; and that
             f) 7 July of each year be designated as “the Africa Integration Day” without
                being a public holiday to commemorate the operationalization of the
                AfCFTA Agreement.

33.    The Council of Ministers was established in terms of Article 11 of the AfCFTA
Agreement and consist of the Ministers responsible for Trade or such other Ministers,
authorities, or officials duly designated by the State Parties. It comprises Member
States which have ratified the Agreement and it will choose its own bureau. The
functions of the Council of Ministers shall in main be to ensure effective
implementation and enforcement of the Agreement and other instruments relevant to
the AfCFTA. These functions are different from those given to the African Union
Ministers of Trade (AMOT) which deals with negotiations. The first meeting of the
Council of Ministers was held in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, on 24 to 25 October 2019.

34.    As Phase I negotiating issues draw to a close, it is anticipated that Phase II
negotiations on Investment, Competition Policy, and Intellectual Property Rights
commence shortly. It should be recalled that the 7th Meeting of the AMOT held in
December 2018 in Cairo, Egypt, gave the deadline of December 2020 for the
conclusion of these phase II negotiations. As an essential step towards the start of
trade on 1st July 2020, several results have been achieved with regard to the AfCFTA
Schedules of Tariff Concessions in Trade in Goods. They are, among others, the
Conclusion of the Outstanding Issues on the Modalities of Tariff Liberalization; the
Adoption of the Template on Tariff Liberalization; the Submission of Tariff Offers as
well as the Cleaning, Verification and Consolidation of Tariff and Import Data. The
road map for finalisation of regulation in Trade in Services has been aligned. In their
meeting held in Niamey, the African Ministers of Trade reaffirmed that the Schedules
of Specific Commitment of the Priority Sectors be finalised by January 2020.
Furthermore, the Ministers agreed that the remaining Services Sectors and the
Regulatory Cooperation Frameworks be finalized by June 2020.

      III.      Free Movement of Persons in Africa and the African
-----------------------Page 10 End-----------------------

                                                                       EX.CL/1214(XXXVI)
                                                                                  Page 8

            Passport

35.      The need to build an Africa where borders between States are transformed into
gateways for communication and movement, has always been the central
preoccupation of African Leaders, as stated in the Abuja Treaty Establishing the
African Economic Community, and more recently, the Protocol to the Treaty on Free
Movement of Persons, Right of Residence and Right of Establishment. However,
difficulties have been encountered in the concrete implementation of the clearly
demonstrated political will, despite the fact that free movement of persons in Africa will
unlock the economic potential in Africa, and speed up integration and socio-economic
development, which is the ultimate aspiration of all Africans.

36.     Efforts to open national borders through the issuance of visas on arrival
observed in some Member States, which are commendable, however remain limited
at continental level, due to failure to obtain the required number of instruments of
ratification for the entry into force of the Protocol. To date, progress in the area of free
movement of persons and goods is as follows:

         i) 33 signatures of the Protocol and 4 instruments of ratification deposited by
              Member States. 15 ratifications are required for its entry into force;
         ii) Political will and commitment already made for the free movement of
              persons in two RECs (ECOWAS and EAC);
         iii) Gradual implementation of the Protocol on Free Movement by Member
              States that have continued to ease their visa regimes, has facilitated the
              issuance of visas on arrival, as laid down in the Protocol on Free Movement.

37.     In order to give greater impetus to the acceleration of free movement of persons
and goods in the Continent, there is a need to designate a Head of State or
Government as Leader of this key issue, for lobbying with his/her peers for the
ratification of the Protocol, in close collaboration with the AU Commission. As several
Heads of State have repeatedly stated, implementation of the free movement of
persons and goods agenda should be carried out in tandem with that of the African
Continental Free Trade Area, for reasons of consistency and efficiency.

   IV.      Continental Monetary and Financial Institutions
38.   Originating from the Treaty Establishing the African Economic Community (The
Abuja Treaty) and other AU Policy Organs’ decisions, Agenda 2063 has incorporated
some pan-African financial institutions as flagship projects under its framework. These
are: The African Central Bank (ACB), African Monetary Fund (AMF), African
Investment Bank (AIB), and Pan-African Stock Exchange (PASE).

39.    In order to accelerate the setting up of the AU Financial Institutions (AUFIs),
the 2019 STC on Finance, Monetary Affairs, Economic Planning, and Integration
requested the Commission to develop a strategy on how to accelerate the signature
and ratification of related legal instruments. In that regard, a study was conducted to
establish the reasons behind the delay in signature and ratification of the legal
instruments on the AUFIs. Subsequently, a meeting was held with selected Member
States to obtain in-depth information and validate the study. Based on the results of
the study, a strategy to expedite the process was developed and the implementation

                                                                     EX.CL/1214(XXXVI)
                                                                                Page 9

will commence immediately.

40.    To assist in advocating for signature and ratification, the Chairperson of the
African Union has nominated H.E. Nana Dankwa Akufo-Addo, President of the
Republic of Ghana, to champion the setting up of the financial institutions.

41.     Given the urgent need for Africa to assume its financial self-sufficiency through
its own financial institutions, the Commission would like to strongly urge Member
States to make a firm commitment to translate Article 19 of the Constitutive Act of the
AU that recognizes ACB, AMF and AIB into reality by expeditiously signing and
ratifying the AUFIs legal instruments, for those who have not yet done so.

42.    In 2019, the process towards putting in place the financial institutions has
continued as follows:

           The African Central Bank (ACB)

43.    The Commission together with the Association of African Central Banks
(AACB) organized a consultative meeting of the AUC-RECs-AACB on the
convergence criteria and timelines for the establishment of the African Central Bank
from 1 to 3 July 2019 in Niamey, Niger, as requested by the 2019 STC Finance,
Monetary Affairs, Economic Planning, and Integration. The meeting noted that there
were divergences in the macroeconomic convergence criteria of RECs and variances
in the timelines for the establishment of regional single currencies. For purposes of
having a single currency at continental level, the meeting emphasized that the
thresholds in all RECs criteria must be aligned to the criteria set at continental level.
As such, RECs must adhere to the criteria as set by the AACB to achieve the same
monetary integration goal.

44.    The consultative meeting further stressed the importance of full commitment of
Member States in adhering to the timelines of the establishment of the African Central
Bank. Therefore, it was agreed that national parliaments should be informed on the
convergence criteria to garner their full support to ensure the implementation of the
Strategy. Meanwhile, the Commission has developed a host country agreement for
the African Monetary Institute (AMI) and prepared its draft statutes and structures,
which will be a transition organ towards the creation of the ACB. In 2020, the
Commission is planning to set up the AMI by recruiting appropriate human resources
to start the implementation of the joint strategy and monitor the performances of
Member States in implementing the macroeconomic convergence criteria.

           The African Monetary Fund

45.    As of November 2019, the instruments of the African Monetary Fund had been
signed by two more Member States making the total of twelve (12) countries. The list
now comprises Benin, Cameroon, Chad, Congo, Comoros, Ghana, Guinea-Bissau,
Guinea, Mauritania, Sao Tome and Principe, Togo and Zambia. In addition, one
signature of ratification has now been deposited by Chad for the Fund's legal
instruments. The operationalization of the African Monetary Fund in Yaoundé is
expected to progress following the conclusion of negotiations and signature of the
Host Country Agreement for the Fund between the Commission and the Republic of
-----------------------Page 12 End-----------------------

                                                                    EX.CL/1214(XXXVI)
                                                                              Page 10

Cameroon.

           The African Investment Bank

46.    During 2019, there has been no change on the list of Member States which
have signed the related legal instruments. They remain twenty-two, namely, Angola,
Benin, Burkina Faso, Chad, Côte d’Ivoire, Comoros, Republic of the Congo,
Democratic Republic of the Congo, Gabon, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea Bissau, Guinea,
Liberia, Libya, Madagascar, Niger, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Sao Tome and Principe,
Togo and Zambia had signed the legal instruments of the AIB. However, with one
additional Member State ratifying the Instruments this year, the total number of
Member States is six (6) namely: Benin, Burkina Faso, Congo, Chad, Libya, and Togo.

   V.     The Grand Inga Dam
47.    The “Grand Inga Hydropower Project” in the Democratic Republic of Congo
(DRC) is under review following an overall scheme (Inga 3 to Inga 8) that is intended
to reach its full capacity of over 44,000 MW and contribute to electricity supply to the
DRC and to the entire continent.

48.     In 2019, the Government of DRC through the “Agence de Développement et
de Promotion du Projet Inga (ADPI)” embarked on a campaign to promote the Grand
Inga Dam project by taking part in the World Hydro Congress in Paris in May 2019.
Meanwhile, the Commission organized in collaboration with UNEP and the Southern
African Institute for Environmental Assessment, a training course on Strategic
Environmental Assessment for DRC senior level decision-makers and African
stakeholders (Regional Power Pools and Regional Economic Communities). The
training took place from 30 September to 2 October 2019 in Addis Ababa. Currently,
the DRC authorities are in discussion with Chinese and Spanish Consortium on the
legal and operationalization modalities of the Consortium for Inga III.

   VI.    Africa Integrated High-Speed Train Network
49.     The African Integrated High-Speed Railway Network Project (AIHSRN) is a
Commission-led initiative designed to interconnect African capitals, economic and
other industrial hubs, the major tourism locations with appropriate high speed rail
technology, other complementary electricity/power and ICT broadband infrastructure
and services. In implementing the project, a core team of African experts under the
leadership of the Commission was formed with the AUC, AUDA-NEPAD, Specialized
Institutions and other relevant partner organizations. Several visits and interactions
have been undertaken to and with the People’s Republic of China, as one of the main
funding partners, which concluded by the signing of the Joint Africa-China Five Years’
Action Plan and Road Map (2016-2020).

50.    The Commission is in the process of setting up the Project Implementation Unit
(PIU) and has conducted three technical meetings (Nairobi, Dakar and Johannesburg)
during 2019 to review the operational tools and relevant implementation strategies and
timelines. Moreover, in the framework of the general process of revitalization of the
railway sector in Africa, a study has been launched by the Commission for the Audit
of the African Union of Railways (AUR), including the harmonization of norms and

                                                                     EX.CL/1214(XXXVI)
                                                                               Page 11

standards of a Trans African railway network.

51.    The Commission is also finalizing a Communication strategy for the AIHSRN
project. In this respect, a video clip for the promotion of the project has been launched
during the PIDA week edition held in Cairo, Egypt from 24 to 29 November 2019.
During this important event, Member States have validated a Detailed Scoping Study.
This Study summarizes the concept and the technical options as well as a general
agenda for the way forward.

      VII.   African Outer Space Strategy
52.     In 2019, the Commission issued an open call to all Member States to express
interest in hosting the African Space Agency (ASE). A high level panel was convened
to review the applications and conduct evaluation on the bids received. The Report of
the High Level Panel was considered by the Assembly which decided that the Republic
of Egypt shall host the Agency (vide Decision Assembly/AU/Dec.748(XXXII)). Since
then, the Commission has consulted Egypt and drafted the Host Agreement, which is
currently under discussions for finalization and signature. In this regard, the PRC and
its relevant Sub-Committees should consider without delay and validate the reports on
the structural and financial Implications of the operationalization of the ASE, in line
with the relevant Assembly decisions.

53.      As part of the implementation of the African Outer Space Programme, the
Commission convened the third Annual African Space Dialogue from 12 to 14 June
2019 in Dakar, Senegal, with the participation of the National Space Agencies, space
institutions, private sector and academia.

54.    During the reporting period, four studies were also carried out by the
Commission to serve as the baseline on which the ASE will build upon while
developing operational programmes and missions. Two of the sectorial studies were
endorsed during the African Space Dialogue, namely: Study on African Private Sector
in Earth Observation, Geospatial and Allied Technologies; and Study on Navigation
and Positioning in Africa.

55.    The Commission participated in the United Nations Committee for Peaceful
Uses of Outer Space (UN-COPUOS), which is the supreme body of all space treaties
globally, and the International Astronautical Congress, the largest gathering of all
space actors globally. These global activities are aimed at fortifying Africa’s space
agenda in the global arena.

56.    All Member States, RECs and other relevant continental institutions are,
therefore, urged to proactively participate in Africa’s journey towards becoming an
equal global space player, by operationalising the ASE and building capabilities in (i)
Earth Observation, (ii) Satellite Communication, (iii) Navigation and Positioning, and
(iv) Space Science and Astronomy, as articulated in the African Space Policy and
Strategy.

      VIII. Pan African Virtual and E-University (PAVEU)

57.      The Pan African Virtual and E-University (PAVEU) is one of AU’s flagship
-----------------------Page 14 End-----------------------

                                                                          EX.CL/1214(XXXVI)
                                                                                    Page 12

projects that has been proposed for addressing Agenda 2063’s needs for accelerating
development of human capital, science and technology and innovation through
increasing access to tertiary and continuing education in Africa, thereby capitalizing
on the digital revolution and global knowledge. In November 2019, four (4) course
programmes have been launched including: Introduction to Virtualization;
Entrepreneurship Knowledge and Skills and Digital Literacy with Cloud Computing;
Skills for Employability; and Media and Information Literacy.

58.    PAVEU Project Implementation Framework was developed to guide the
implementation of the PAVEU in terms of its mission and scope of work, principles and
core values and other related technical aspects. The document also addresses a
possible business plan and the financial sustainability of the PAVEU, including
guidelines on the Institute’s management structures, staffing and potential
partnerships with other role players. Over 2019, strategic partnerships have been
established with four key organizations that work in ODeL to support quality assurance
and delivery of PAVeU courses, including: African Council for Distance Education
(ACDE), UNESCO, African Virtual University, and VMware.

      IX.      Single African Air Transport Market (SAATM)

59.     Following the adoption by the Assembly of January 2015 of the Declaration on
the establishment of a Single African Air Transport Market (SAATM) in the
implementation of the Yamoussoukro Decision (1999), it was launched as a flagship
project officially at the Assembly in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, on 29th January 2018. So
far, thirty (30) Member States have signed the Solemn Commitment to the
establishment of the SAATM, namely: Benin, Burkina Faso, Botswana, Cabo Verde,
Cameroon, Central African Republic, Republic of Congo, Côte d’Ivoire, Chad,
Democratic Republic of Congo, Egypt, Ethiopia, Gabon, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea,
Kenya, Lesotho, Liberia, Mali, Morocco, Mozambique, Niger, Nigeria, Rwanda, Sierra
Leone, South Africa, Eswatini, Togo and Zimbabwe. Equatorial Guinea is also
finalizing the internal administrative procedures to sign the solemn commitment which
will increase the number of SAATM States to thirty-one (31).

60.         To date, the following developments have been registered:

            i) 18 SAATM Member States have also signed a Memorandum of
                 Implementation (MoI) that ensures the removal of any air service agreement
                 restrictions that are not in compliance with the Yamoussoukro Decision;
            ii) 11 out of the 29 States comply 100% with all the concrete measures,
                 namely: Benin, Burkina Faso, Cabo Verde, Ethiopia, Ghana, Mozambique,
                 Niger, Republic of Congo, Rwanda, Gambia and Togo. These countries are
                 commended for the fulfilment of their commitments;
            iii) Draft Guidelines for negotiation of air service agreements between SAATM
                 States and third countries have been developed and are under review for
                 submission to AU Policy Organs for validation;
            iv) IATA has developed a SAATM 55 Country Index using the SAATM enablers
                 (Safety, Security Infrastructure, Visa openness, etc.) as indices to identify
                 State and airline readiness for SAATM and as a support advocacy tool;
            v) A joint stakeholders’ Priority Action Plan for the SAATM has been
                 established and is updated annually;
-----------------------Page 15 End-----------------------

                                                                       EX.CL/1214(XXXVI)
                                                                                 Page 13

        vi) The stakeholders African Development Bank (AfDB), European Union (EU),
             World Bank (WB) have made specific pledges to provide technical and
             financial support currently amounting to over US$ 5.0 million for the joint
             SAATM Priority Action Plan;
        vii) A new Secretary General of the African Civil Aviation Commission (AFCAC)
             also Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the SAATM Executing Agency has
             been recruited.

61.    Among the challenges to be addressed through collaborative efforts by the
African Union, its Member States and other relevant stakeholders are:

        i) Inadequate financial resources to enable the Executing Agency to become
             operational;
        ii) Slow pace of Member States in subscribing to the Solemn Commitment;
        iii) Lack of technical resources and tools for effective advocacy to the
             remaining states;
        iv) Incomplete policy, legal and regulatory framework, including external policy,
             dispute settlement mechanism and the African Aviation Tribunal and board
             of appeal;
        v) Capacity building of Member States and RECs on the implementation of the
             YD regulatory text (competition and consumer protection) and competition
             rules; and
        vi) Elaborating a continental aviation infrastructure master plan to cope with
             future traffic growth.

62.   The following recommendations are made as a way forward to address the
above challenges:

        i) To engage further advocacy efforts through the Leader of the Project who
             may be assisted by regional champions with a target to reach 40 Member
             States;
        ii) Validation and dissemination of the External Policy Guidelines with Binding
             Clauses for negotiation of air services agreements with non-African states
             and regions;
        iii) Provision of technical assistance to ensure compliance with ICAO
             Standards;
        iv) Determination of sustainable resource mobilization mechanism for the
             Executing Agency;
        v) Elaboration of aviation infrastructure master plan (airports, navigation
             facilities, etc.) with priority projects to be included in second phase of the
             Programme for Infrastructure Development in Africa-PAP (PIDA-PAP);
        vi) Initiating elaboration of a Single Sky Architecture for Africa to be completed
             by 2023.

   X.      Silencing the Guns by 2020

63.    This Flagship Project is an integral part of the implementation of Agenda 2063,
which aims at building a peaceful, prosperous and integrated Continent. Charged with
its implementation, the Peace and Security Council, has made efforts within the
framework of the Roadmap adopted by its decision-making organs in 2017. Such
-----------------------Page 16 End-----------------------

                                                                   EX.CL/1214(XXXVI)
                                                                             Page 14

efforts include various joint initiatives and actions by the Commission, the RECS and
Regional Mechanisms, other AU Organs, the United Nations, Civil Society
Organisations and AU Partners, according to the division of labour determined by the
main Roadmap. We owe a debt of gratitude to the United Nations Security Council,
African Members of that Council, particularly Equatorial Guinea, as President of the
UN Security Council for February 2019. The joint mobilisation of all these actors
culminated in the adoption of UN Resolution 2457 (2019), on the AU initiative, aimed
at silencing the guns in Africa.

64.    My High Representative for “Silencing the Guns by 2020 », continues in the
wake of efforts initiated in 2017 by the AU Commission, Member States and partners,
geared towards exploring the best options to advance the process for the
implementation of this important Flagship Project. The adoption by the July 2019
Session of the Assembly of the Union of “Silencing the Guns” as the theme of the year
2020, is an indicator of the political will to speed up the implementation of this key
Flagship Project.

     XI.    Cybersecurity
65.    The Commission hosted the Annual Meeting of the Global Forum for
Cybersecurity Expertise (GFCE) from 8 to 10 October 2019, which was followed on
11 October by the Global Cyber Stability Commission Meeting and AU/UN
negotiations on International Cybersecurity matters and their impact on International
peace and security within the framework of the UN Government Group Experts
(UNGGE) regional consultations.

66.   Meanwhile, AUDA-NEPAD rendered support to 14 countries, namely Benin,
Chad, Congo, DRC, Gabon, Guinea, Kenya, Libya, Mauritania, Morocco, Rwanda,
Senegal, Tunisia and Uganda and two RECs (ECCAS and UMA) in assessment on
Cybersecurity regulation and policy. The assessment was made on several
parameters - including REC membership, signing of the AU Convention on
Cybersecurity, representation on PAP committee dealing with this issue, etc.

C.         INSTITUTIONAL REFORMS AND SELF-FINANCING
67.    The January 2017 AU Assembly Decision, Assembly/AU/Dec.635(XXVIII), on
the Institutional Reform of the African Union (AU) sets out a comprehensive AU reform
agenda. It is aimed at fundamentally re-positioning the organization to meet the
evolving needs of its Member States and the continent and identifies the following core
reform priorities:
            i) Focus on key priorities with continental scope;
            ii) Realign African Union institutions in order to deliver against those
                 priorities;
            iii) Connect the African Union to its citizens;
            iv) Manage the business of the African Union efficiently and effectively at
                 both the political and operational levels;
            v) Finance the African Union sustainably and with the full ownership of the
                 Member States.
-----------------------Page 17 End-----------------------

                                                                      EX.CL/1214(XXXVI)
                                                                                Page 15

68.    The Assembly Decision on reform provides a framework for the transformation
of the African Union into an effective and efficient organisation that delivers for African
citizens. Based on this framework detailed implementation proposals are being
developed.

69.   The reform decision took into account previous reform proposals, most notably
the 2007 Adedeji Audit, which made extensive and far-reaching recommendations on
how to improve the overall effectiveness of the Union. Unfortunately, most of these
were never implemented.

   I.     Mandate, Implementation Approach and Principles
70.    Based on the previous implementation challenges, and the strategic
importance of the reform agenda, the AU Assembly took the decision to oversee the
reform process. The reform decision designated President Paul Kagame to supervise
the implementation process. It was also determined that he would work with two other
Heads of State, the 2016 Chair of the Union, President Idriss Deby, and the 2017
Chair of the Union, President Alpha Conde.

71.    The Assembly also requested President Kagame to report on progress made
in implementing Decision Assembly/AU/Dec.635 (XXIX) at each Ordinary Session of
the Assembly.

72.    During the January 2018 Summit, the AU Assembly decided that as part of the
process of deepening consultations around the reform implementation process, the
Reform Troika, should be expanded to the Bureau of the Assembly of the Union. The
Assembly also decided to establish a group of fifteen (15) Ministers of Foreign Affairs,
three per region to play an advisory role to the reform process

   II.    What Has Been Achieved to Date?
73.    The November 2018 Extraordinary Summit on the AU reforms established a
new structure for the senior leadership of the AU Commission along with a new
process for the selection of the senior leadership of the AU Commission. The new
selection process will be operationalised in 2020 in order to establish a new
Commission in February 2021.

74.    In order to develop the new selection modalities, the Assembly decided to
establish a Panel of Eminent Africans, composed of five (5) eminent personalities, one
per region, to oversee the pre-selection of candidatures of the senior leadership of the
Commission.

75.   Three regional nominations have been received. These are from the Central,
Southern and Western Africa regions. The Committee of Permanent Representatives
(PRC) met in November 2019 and determined that if no further regional nominations
were received by mid-December 2019, the Panel should start its work.

76.     The adoption of the new structure of the AU Commission. The November 2018
AU Extraordinary Assembly Decision, Ext/Assembly/AU/Dec.1-4(XI), on the
Institutional Reform of the African Union (AU) in which the Assembly decided as
-----------------------Page 18 End-----------------------

                                                                   EX.CL/1214(XXXVI)
                                                                             Page 16

follows: MANDATES the Chairperson of the Commission to develop a new
departmental structure that is lean and performance-oriented, taking into account the
division of labour between the African Union, RECs and Regional Mechanisms,
Member States and continental organisations.

77.     Between March and April 2019, proposals for the restructuring of the
Commission were developed with the support of an independent consulting firm. The
proposals were submitted to Member States for their consideration in May
2019. Following initial deliberations, Member States decided the following: First, that
the restructuring proposals should be budget neutral. If this is not possible that any
additional cost should be financed from budget savings; second, to extend the period
for the review of the structure to allow Member States to consult their capitals.

78.    The Sub-committees of the Permanent Representatives Committee reviewed
the proposed new structure and along with the proposed financing strategy in October
and November 2019. The revised proposal was considered by the PRC in December
2019 with a view to presenting the new departmental structure for adoption in February
2020.

79.    Third, within the framework of establishing a more effective division of labour
between the AU and Regional Economic Communities, we intend to submit a draft
Protocol on the relations between the AU and Regional Economic Communities along
with and the Rules of Procedure for the Mid-Year Coordination Meeting for adoption
by the Assembly during the next Summit. The Draft Protocol has recently been
reviewed by the Specialised Technical Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs in
November 2019.

80.    The operationalization of the AU Peace Fund: During the 35th Ordinary Session
of the Executive Council of the African Union held from 4 to 8 July 2019, the Executive
Council reiterated that the AU Peace Fund should not be utilised until all the
governance and management structures are fully operationalised and urged the
Commission to conclude the process by February 2020. Good progress has been
made. Since 2017, 50 Member States have contributed $131m to the Peace Fund.
The target is to reach $400m in Member State contributions by 2021.

81.     Strengthening the AU recruitment system: In November 2018, the Executive
Council requested that the Commission work with a group of ten independent experts
to review and improve the AU Recruitment and Selection System to institute a credible
and robust recruitment and selection system. The experts started work in July 2019
and produced a very good inception report and work plan which was presented to
Member States in September 2019 and they are working towards submitting their final
report by December 2019. We are looking forward to solid recommendations emerging
from this important process.

D.        IMPLEMENTATION OF AGENDA 2063 FTYIP
     I.    The Roll Out of the Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E)
           Framework for Agenda 2063
-----------------------Page 19 End-----------------------

                                                                     EX.CL/1214(XXXVI)
                                                                               Page 17

82.    The Agenda 2063 FTYIP Monitoring and Evaluation Framework and its Core
Indicators Handbook were disseminated to all Member States to guide in collecting
data and on reporting progress on Agenda 2063. By the end of 2019, forty-two (42)
Member States had benefited from technical support to enable them report on Agenda
2063. Seventeen (17) of them have already submitted data based reports on Agenda
2063.

83.     The Commission and AUDA-NEPAD organized a continental workshop on an
empirical methodology to guide national, regional and continental bodies to track and
report on the implementation of Agenda 2063. The workshop brought together
participants from forty (40) Member States and six (6) RECs, resulting in the
preparation of country and REC-level progress reports on the implementation of
Agenda 2063 for the period 2013 to 2019.

84.    Ongoing support is being provided to Member States and RECs to complete,
validate and submit their reports to the AU. These reports, including a performance
dashboard, will be presented at a High-Level Forum on Agenda 2063 that will take
place during the AU Summit in February 2020. Furthermore, AUDA-NEPAD and AUC
will compile a continental-level report, which will be presented to the AU Assembly in
February 2020 by H.E. Mr. Alassane Dramane Ouattara, President of the Republic of
Côte d’Ivoire and Champion of African Union Agenda 2063.

   II.          Mid-Term Review of the First Ten-Year Implementation Plan

85.     The year 2019 marks five years since the adoption and execution of the First
Ten-Year Implementation Plan of Agenda 2063 which runs from 2014 to 2023. It is,
therefore, imperative that a review of the FTYIP is conducted to ascertain whether
Africa is on the right track in the implementation process. This calls for a well-planned
and articulated review exercise, which should involve all stakeholders. More precisely,
the purpose of the review exercise is to assess the level of achievement in the
implementation of all aspects of the FTYIP at Member States, RECs and AU Organs’
levels. The outcome of the evaluation will result in:

         i)       Modifications to the results framework;
         ii)      strategies for deepening domestication and awareness of the Agenda at
                  all levels;
         iii)     Strategies for enhancing awareness and use of the Resource
                  Mobilization and Partnership Strategy, and the Monitoring and
                  Evaluation (M&E) Framework, including the Core Indicators Handbook;
         iv)      Prioritized and better categorized short, medium and long-term
                  implementation horizons for the Agenda 2063 Flagship Projects;
         v)       Measures for strengthening the implementation and coordination of the
                  monitoring and evaluation of the FTYIP at the national (with UNDP),
                  regional and continental levels.

86.   In line with the Executive Council Decision EX.CL/Dec.1060 (XXXV), the
Midterm Review Report is expected to be presented to the Executive Council Ordinary
Session in July 2020. The process of procurement of an expert services is underway
with Terms of Reference already approved by the Ambassadorial Committee on
Agenda 2063.

                                                                              Page 18


   III.         Financing and Domestic Resource Mobilization for Agenda
                2063
87.    The Executive Council approved the Agenda 2063 Financing, Domestic
Resource Mobilization (DRM) and Partnership Strategy in January 2018 and
requested the Commission and the AfDB, in close collaboration with UNECA and
AUDA to prepare an “Agenda 2063 Financing and DRM Roadmap and Guide” based
on the “Adopted Agenda 2063 Financing, DRM and Partnership Strategy”.

88.    Accordingly, in order to operationalize the DRM Strategy, a series of Joint
Technical Meetings have been held with the concerned institutions, namely, AfDB,
UNECA and AUDA to form a resource mobilization platform, which will spearhead this
process. The DRM Technical Working Group (TWG) was officially launched on 8
October 2019, in Addis Ababa. The key outcomes of the meeting included, inter alia,
the agreement on:

          i)      Terms of Reference for the TWG and the division of labour amongst the
                  member institutions; and
          ii)     The roadmap for implementation including the technical approach and
                  resource requirements for the exercise.

89.    The Technical Working Group meeting also recognized the Joint Secretariat
Support Office (JSSO) as a key structure to this process particularly for Secretariat
role. Currently, a process is underway to engage a consultancy firm to develop the
DRM “Guide” and implementation roadmap, expected to be finalized in 2020 for
dissemination and domestication by Member States.

   IV.          Joint AU/UN Framework on the implementation of Agenda
                2063 and SDGs

90.    Following the agreement between the AU and UN on the Framework for a
Renewed UN/AU Partnership on Africa’s Integration and Development Agendas
(PAIDA) of March 2015, which is based on Agenda 2063 and the 2030 Agenda for
Sustainable Development, the two institutions have developed two joint instruments
for the execution of PAIDA. These are the Joint United Nations-African Union
Framework for an Enhanced Partnership in Peace and Security and the African Union-
United Nations Framework for the Implementation of Agenda 2063 and the 2030
Agenda for Sustainable Development signed on 19 April 2017 and 27 January 2018
respectively.

91.    PAIDA has replaced the previous Framework for the Ten-Year Capacity
Building Programme for the African Union (2006-2016). The responsibility to oversee
its implementation was vested in the Regional Coordination Mechanism (RCM).
Consultations are now underway between the AU and UN to review the RCM structure
to take on the new responsibilities, through the joint leadership of the Commission, the
Executive Secretary of UNECA and the Special Representative of the UN Secretary-
General to the AU.

                                                                    EX.CL/1214(XXXVI)
                                                                              Page 19

     V.       Agenda 2063 Research Project on the implementation of the
              FTYIP

92.    The African Union Agenda 2063 Research Project is coordinated by the
College of Economic and Management Sciences at the University of South Africa in
conjunction with the Commission. The project is dedicated towards specialized
research and capacity development especially in the field of business,
entrepreneurship and enterprises for youth and women (e.g. renewable energies,
solar, water technologies).

93.   In accordance with the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) signed between
the Commission and the University of South Africa in 2014, work continues on the six
research projects identified, namely:

           i) Agricultural production efficiency in Africa: Prospects for high growth
                strategies in food security commodities;
           ii) Harnessing economic and political verities in the development and
                implementation of appropriate youth employment policies;
           iii) Renewable Energy and Economic Growth in the SADC Region;
           iv) Exploring the prospects of Human Settlements in a regionally integrated
                Africa;
           v) Advancing Productive Transformation in Africa: Assessing and monitoring
                justice practices in the workplace for decent employment;
           vi) Millennial Women Entrepreneurs: Opportunities and Challenges in Africa.

94.    In addition to the six research projects, the Commission and UNISA are
organizing AU-UNISA 2020 conference under the theme “Silencing Guns by 2020:
Creating Conducive Conditions for Africa’s Development” to cover various thematic
areas with focus on priorities of Agenda 2063 and its FTYIP.

     VI.      Revitalization of the Ministerial Committee on Agenda 2063

95.      In line with its mandate as outlined in the Executive Council Decision
EX.CL/Dec.998(XXXII) of January 2018, the Ministerial Committee on Agenda 2063
has undertaken a wide range of activities, which basically cover monitoring all aspects
of the implementation of Agenda 2063, including domesticating Agenda 2063, aligning
annual AU themes with the Agenda 2063 Flagship Projects and making follow-up on
the execution of the latter. It met in March 2019 in Gaborone, Botswana, under the
Chairmanship of the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Botswana. It took stock of the
implementation of Agenda 2063 with particular focus on the progress made in the
domestication of the Agenda, monitoring and evaluation, progress in Flagship Projects
as well as recommending the AU Theme of the Year 2020, which was agreed to be
on silencing the Guns. In order to enhance the performance of the Ministerial
Committee on Agenda 2063 and to drive its effective implementation, the ongoing AU
institutional reform would establish a relevant structure within the Commission to
support its activities.

E.         IMPLEMENTATION OF DECISIONS OF THE POLICY
           ORGANS
-----------------------Page 22 End-----------------------

                                                                    EX.CL/1214(XXXVI)
                                                                              Page 20


96.   The Commission wishes to draw attention that, during the period under review,
the Commission implemented fifty-five (55) of the ninety-seven decisions (56.7%). It
should be pointed out that this activity is a joint activity for both the Commission and
Member States as most of the decisions are expected to be implemented by the latter.
To facilitate this exercise, the Commission has addressed a questionnaire seeking
information about Member States’ implementation activities. Unfortunately, only three
Member States, namely, Mali, Mauritius and Morocco have responded so far. Other
Member States are once more called upon to give a feedback to the Commission.



   I.       Legal Instruments adopted
97.   During the reporting period, the following Legal Instruments were adopted by
the Policy Organs:

         i) Treaty for the establishment of the African Medicines Agency;
         ii) Statute of the African Audio Visual and Cinema Commission;
         iii) Statute of the African Union International Centre for Girls’ and Women’s
              Education in Africa (AU/CIEFFA);
         iv) African Union Transitional Justice Policy; Rules of Procedure of the
              Specialized Technical Committee on Finance, Monetary Affairs, Economic
              Planning and Integration and Draft Legal Instruments for the AUDA/
              NEPAD;
         v) The Assembly also adopted an amendment to Article 35 of the Charter for
              African Cultural Renaissance.

98.    Upon standing instructions of the Executive Council, the Commission
embarked, during 2019, on the harmonization of the texts of the treaties in all the
working languages so as to expedite the process of review of OAU/AU Treaties and
enable Member States to accelerate the process of ratification/accession to these
Treaties. Certified copies of those harmonized Treaties are now readily available to
the Member States for their appropriate action in the facilitation of the ratification
process.

   II.      Signature and Ratification/Accession of OAU/AU Treaties
99.    In line with previous decisions of the Executive Council regarding the signing of
treaties by Member States, the Commission has taken measures to ensure that
signing of treaties takes place at all future ordinary sessions of the Assembly, making
the treaties available for their signature during the 32nd Ordinary Session of the
Assembly in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia in February 2019, the 12th Extra-ordinary Session
of the Assembly and the First Mid-Year Coordination Meeting between the African
Union, Regional Economic Communities in Niamey, Niger in July 2019. Following the
Summit signature campaigns, eleven (11) signatures and six (6) ratifications were
registered. As November 2019, the Commission has registered a total of thirty-three
(33) signatures and fifty-three (53) instruments of ratification / accession.

100.     The signatures are significant in that they signify Member States’ commitment
-----------------------Page 23 End-----------------------

                                                                      EX.CL/1214(XXXVI)
                                                                                Page 21

to particular treaties and Member States’ obligation to refrain from acts which would
defeat the object and purpose of the treaty. It is hoped that treaties ratified will be
domesticated and implemented by Member States, consequently advancing the socio-
economic and political integration of the continent and improving lives of the African
people, in line with the aspirations of Agenda 2063. It will be recalled that, in order to
facilitate treaties signature and ratification, the Executive Council has established an
AU Law week and Treaty Signature month, which was later on extended to the whole
month of December of each year.

101. Further, the Commission intends to publish a Treaties Book in all the four (4)
AU Working languages as a compilation of OAU/AU treaties from 1963 to 2014
intended to popularize the treaties and to facilitate easy access by different
stakeholders. Through the technical assistance from UNDP and funding from Swedish
Government, the Commission is upgrading the AU Treaties Webpage to have more
relevant, interactive and updated information. This is scheduled to be launched during
the February 2020 Summit.

F.         DELIVERING ON CONTINENTAL FRAMEWORKS AND
           MANDATES
     I.      Economic Transformation,              Inclusive      Growth,      Poverty
             Reduction

                a. Economic Transformation

102. Since the beginning of the Twenty-First Century, Africa has ranked second
behind Asia on the leader board of the world's fastest-growing regions, with average
annual growth in gross domestic product (GDP) of 4.7% since 2000. However, the
level of growth has been insufficient to trigger fundamental changes on the continent
urging the Commission to take various initiatives:

         2019 Africa’s Development Dynamics Report (ADD) on “Achieving
          Productive Transformation”

103. Following the success of the first edition of ADD launched in 2018 that focused
on "growth, jobs and inequalities", and in continued, collaboration with the
Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Center, the
second edition of the ADD has been issued in 2019. It focuses on “Achieving
Productive Transformation” and coincides with the launching of the AfCFTA, Within
this context, a key question is to know whether African firms can upscale and deliver
in the competitive landscape to fuel economic development, create jobs, fight poverty
and advance prosperity, thus realizing the continent’s production transformation and
Agenda 2063 Goals. The second ADD emphasizes the need for Africa to accelerate
its productive transformation to create quality jobs, grow their businesses from lagging
to leading firms producing more and better products in order to compete in the
upcoming new open market of the AfCFTA.

104. A strong push is crucial to boost (i) firms’ internal capabilities to innovate,
upgrade or switch to new business models; (ii) combining with existing capabilities
-----------------------Page 24 End-----------------------

                                                                      EX.CL/1214(XXXVI)
                                                                                Page 22

inside the economy and regional production networks, and (iii) exporters’ abilities to
survive, as quality services in general need to be at the centre of public policies and
market priorities. African policy makers need to support local firms in improving
proprietary, industrial and commercial performances.

105. There is also need for governments to concentrate their resources, they should
prioritize business services for firms that cluster with and around each other. Clusters
enable governments with constrained resources to make the most of their assets by
investing in a targeted place. This is especially effective if governments provide
business services to improve specialisation, linkages and skills. At the same time,
clusters need to tap into regional production networks. Policies can reduce the
uncertainties of accessing new markets. The most competitive firms must embrace
greater trade with intra-African and global markets to deliver for growing demand.
Designing and implementing policies in these three areas are key for jumpstarting and
encouraging actions that will allow Africa’s firms to compete in AfCFTA and beyond.

      Domestic Resource Mobilization: Fighting against Corruption and Illicit
       Financial Flows (IFFs)

106. In addition to the 2019 ADD, a new report titled “Domestic Resource
Mobilization: Fighting against Corruption and Illicit Financial Flows (IFFs)” has been
produced. This publication contributes to the Commission’s efforts to raise awareness
on the impact of Corruption and Illicit Financial Flows on the continent. Although it is
difficult to quantify the amounts loss due to IFF and Corruption, statistics estimate that
between 50 and 80 billion USD are lost annually, and these figures seem to be on an
upward trajectory. This amount is higher than the annual Official Development
Assistance (ODA) that the continent receives.

107. Addressing the issue of corruption and IFFs has been a priority area for the AU
for quite some time leading to many initiatives, including the theme for the year 2018
to be “Winning the Fight against Corruption: A Sustainable Path to Africa’s
Transformation”. This publication, therefore, comprises analytical perspectives on the
issue of corruption and IFFs; and country cases across the continent with specific
actions that are being taken by Member States, to mobilize domestic resources and
fight against corruption and IFFs. It includes case studies of various countries where
governments, state institutions, judiciary, private sector and civil society have
demonstrated advancement in the fight against corruption and IFFs.

108. The domestic resource mobilization part of the report is key to establishing a
long-term path to sustainable development financing. Its recommendations include:
taxation; savings mobilization and financial inclusion; and curbing IFFs. The domestic
resource mobilization can be enhanced through improvement of the efficiency of
existing tax systems by taking profit of opportunities abounding from digitalization and
transparency initiatives, the optimization of tax incentives, the rationalization of tax
exemptions, the expansion of the tax base, the implementation of specialized taxes
as well as the establishment of solid domestic institutions and policy frameworks.

              b. Private Sector Development

109.    Notwithstanding the challenges facing Africa’s private sector such as small size
-----------------------Page 25 End-----------------------

                                                                      EX.CL/1214(XXXVI)
                                                                                Page 23

and informality, weak linkages, low level of competitiveness, and limited innovations,
the opportunities for Africa’s private sector are immense and it remains a key
component towards achieving economic transformation and deepening of Africa’s
integration agenda. Africa’s private sector has the potential to be part of global value
chains and benefit from the much needed technology through joint ventures and other
forms of partnerships with other private sector actors from other parts of the world.

110. The Commission organized the eleventh edition of the African Union Private
Sector Forum from 6 to 8 November 2019 in Antananarivo, Madagascar. The forum
was held under the theme: "Transforming African Economies through Mobilization of
the private sector and capitalization on experiences from other regions of the world".
In the final Declaration, the Forum mainly focused and had vibrant discussions around
the areas of finance and investment, agribusiness, mining industry, digital
technologies, tourism, human capital development and entrepreneurship for women
and youth entrepreneurs.

111. The Commission also drafted the African Union Private Sector Development
Strategy 2016-2020. This is a concrete step towards enhancing private sector capacity
to be part of the global value chains so as to enable it contribute towards the attainment
of Agenda 2063 for inclusive and sustainable growth in Africa.

112. The Commission continues to be actively involved in the organization of private
sector development initiatives with the aim to promote cooperation and coordination
amongst different stakeholders such as public and private sector dialogues and hold
high level business fora with development partners such as Africa-EU Business
Forum, Turkey-Africa Economic Forum and Africa-Arab Business Forum among
others.

113. Further, the Commission is working on enhancing the capacity building for
African youth and women entrepreneurs through targeted training and mentorship
programs with new innovative ideas and skills to improve their way of doing business.
Through such platforms, the Commission has worked closely with Member States
private sector representatives and other relevant stakeholders in developing and
implementing relevant policies in business, regulatory reforms including the Pan-
African Investment Code (PAIC), as requested by the STC on Trade, Industry and
Minerals to include PAIC as a reference framework document on the investment
chapter in the AfCFTA.

    Annual African Private Sector Forum

114. In view of the critical role that the private sector is expected to play in the
development and integration of the African economies, in particular its contribution to
poverty reduction through investment and employment creation, the Commission
organizes an annual African Private Sector Forum, in line with the relevant decision
Executive Council of January 2005 in Abuja, Nigeria, which institutionalized the African
Union Private Sector Forum. The Forum is a key instrument of interface and
partnership between the African Union policy makers and the private sector and acts
as a vehicle for empowering the African private sector through advocacy, sharing
business and market information and skills required in the implementation of the AU
Strategies. The Commission has to date organized eleventh editions of the African
-----------------------Page 26 End-----------------------

                                                                      EX.CL/1214(XXXVI)
                                                                                Page 24

Private Sector Forum.

          EU-Africa Business Forum

115. The African Union and the European Union institutionalized the EU-Africa
Business Forum (EABF) in 2006 as part of efforts to improve the environment for
business and increase investment in Africa. The Forum, held alternately between
Africa and Europe aims, among others, at:

     i)     Influencing improvements and attracting the business and investment climate
            in Africa through enhanced governance, capacity building and policy
            coherence;
    ii)     Giving a voice to the private sector to engage in direct dialogue with the AU
            Commission and the European Commission, which maintain a permanent
            dialogue with the African Governments and regional organizations; and
    iii)    Making Africa more attractive to the European private sector by providing a
            more accurate and positive image of the continent as a place for business and
            investment.

116. Cognizant that the private sector is a critical partner for achieving the objectives
of the Joint Africa-EU Strategy (JAES) and the MDGs, the Forum is a high level
platform to engage with political leaders in a concrete and constructive dialogue where
parties involved hold each other accountable. The Commission, in partnership with
the European Commission, will continue organizing the Forum which provides a
unique opportunity for African and European companies to network and exchange
views and enhance Africa-EU business and investment relations in changing
environment.

          African Inclusive Markets Excellence Centre (AIMEC)

117. The Executive Council held from 25 to 26 January 2018, in Addis Ababa,
decided, among other things, decided on the establishment of the African Inclusive
Market Excellence Center (AIMEC) and requested the Commission to submit the
relevant structural, financial and legal implications, in line with the AU rules and
procedures. It also requested the Commission to ensure that the selection of the
Member State to host AIMEC is carried out in conformity with the laid down criteria.

118. Pursuant to the said Decision, the Commission in 2019 contacted Member
States interested to host the Center. The Member States, which offered to host the
Center were Benin and Tunisia. An assessment team will be dispatched to discuss
with the relevant authorities to evaluate the facilities which the proposed host countries
are putting forward with regard to hosting the Center in line with the AU selection
criteria.

                  c. Hubs for Industrialization/Manufacturing

119. As Economic Zones are becoming the most popular instrument for developing
economies in emergent countries, the Commission is working towards developing a
Continental Special Economic Zone (SEZ) Framework benchmarked on international
best practice to guide Member States in their design and implementation of related
-----------------------Page 27 End-----------------------

                                                                      EX.CL/1214(XXXVI)
                                                                                Page 25

policies. This aims at maximizing benefits from this strategic industrial policy
instrument that has been significant in delivering structural transformation in East Asia.

120. In this regard, on 21 November 2019, the Commission supported the Africa
Free Zones Organisation (AFZO) 4th Annual Meeting, under the theme “Economic
Zones - Accelerator for Industrialization in Africa”, on the margins of the Africa
Industrialization Week 2019. AFZO brings together leading African Economic Zones
and institutions in charge of development, management and promotion of the zones
on the continent. Several participants from 60 Economic Zones in Africa and
international institutions such as UNCTAD, UNIDO, UNECA, and AfDB shared their
expertise on challenges and effective means to enhance economic zones
development in Africa.

    Accelerated Industrial Development for Africa (AIDA)

121. The Accelerated Industrial Development for Africa (AIDA), which was adopted
by the Assembly in 2008 in an effort to drive the development and integration of
industrialization in national development policies and strategies has continued to be
pursued by the Commission. In this regard, it has undertaken a study on financing the
industrialization drive.     Furthermore, the promotion of regional value chain
development initiatives, and cross border investment initiatives have received
prominence during 2019, as a strategic model to de-risk investment and promote inter
and intra-industry trade on the continent. Regional Value Chain development is also
envisaged to significantly improve Africa’s investment mobilisation prospects, whilst at
the same time fostering balanced, inclusive and sustainable industrialisation.

    Small and Medium Size Enterprises (SME) Strategy

122. Following the recommendation by the Second STC on Trade, Industry and
Minerals (STC-TIM), in February 2019, the Assembly adopted the AU Small and
Medium Enterprise (SME) Strategy. The SME strategy comes at a critical time when
the Africa Continental Free Trade Area has entered its operational phase. The
Strategy is expected to guide the continent in the development of competitive,
diversified and sustainable economies underpinned by dynamic, entrepreneurial and
industrial sectors that generate employment, reduce poverty and foster social
inclusion. The Commission is currently working on the establishment of an
Implementation Coordination Unit and the institutionalization of an annual African
Union Forum for SMEs, as recommended by the Second STC-TIM.

    Enterprise Africa Network

123. During the period under review, the Commission finalized the feasibility study
on “Enterprise Africa Network’’ (EAN) to facilitate the establishment of a ‘’Pool of
competitive SMEs’’ in Africa. SMEs at different stages will receive support from
another ‘’Pool of accredited Business Development Services organisations’’ to build
their capacity in order to position them to access markets.

124. The core of EAN will be made up of the Commission and RECs while the
privileged partners will consist of regional and continental Business Associations and
Business Development Solution Organizations. Sustainable collaborations will be
-----------------------Page 28 End-----------------------

                                                                     EX.CL/1214(XXXVI)
                                                                               Page 26

established with experienced international organisations on entrepreneurship
development on trade information portal and on market intelligence information. EAN
is expected to be an answer to accelerating Africa’s development prospects,
considering its projected economic growth, a large population of innovative women
and youth entrepreneurs. The Commission is working on the development of a
Resource Mobilization Strategy, framework and partnership agreements with donors
interested in EAN.

    Fashion Value Chain Development

125. The value of the global Fashion Industry (Clothing, footwear, accessories,
jewelleries and cosmetics) is around $2.4 trillion, with an annual growth of 5.5%. Africa
accounts for a marginal share of this value, at less than 5%, while Asia and the USA
share equally 80% of the market. This value is estimated at $3 billion where 90% of
the players are SMEs. Against this background, the Second STC-TIM held in January
2019, urged the Commission to develop a program of work on the Presidential Fashion
Initiative as a step for the promotion of the African Fashion Value Chain and as a tool
for employment and wealth creation in African economies.

126. Accordingly, the Commission undertook a series of activities, including the
establishment of an expert working group, panel discussions on the margin of the 32nd
Summit, AfCFTA Business Forum 2019 and the African Industrialization Week 2019.
During the discussions, challenges and opportunities facing Africa SMEs in the fashion
sector were debated and attention was drawn to new potential growth areas in order
to showcase manufacturing opportunities.

    Africa Industrialization Week

127. In the framework of the Africa Industrialization Day 2019 on 20 November,
which was graced by H.E. Sahle-Work Zewde, President of the Federal Democratic
Republic of Ethiopia, and several Member State’s Ministers and high level dignitaries,
the Commission also commemorated the 30th Edition of Africa Industrialization Week
(AIW2019) in Addis Ababa from 18 to 22 November 2019 under the theme “Positioning
African Industry to Supply the AfCFTA Market”. The programme aimed at mobilizing
the commitment of African countries and the international community towards the
industrialization of Africa and providing an opportunity to key stakeholders to reflect
on Africa’s industrialization. The event was co-organized by a number of partners
including: The Ethiopian Government (Ministry of Trade and Industry), the
International Trade Center (ITC); the United Nations Industrial Development
Organization (UNIDO), the United Nations Conference for Trade and Development;
the Korea-Africa Foundation and the African Free Zones Organizations with a wide
range of activities attracting 1500 participants from various sectors.

    Quality Infrastructure

128. Taking note of the rapidly unfolding Africa integration developments,
particularly with respect to the AfCFTA, and recognising the importance of
underpinning Africa’s industrial development with sound standards and quality
principles, the Commission initiated the development of an Africa Quality Policy
(AQP), working closely with Member States and RECs. The AQP provides guidance
-----------------------Page 29 End-----------------------

                                                                      EX.CL/1214(XXXVI)
                                                                                Page 27

for the development and sustainability of a robust quality infrastructure for the
continent closely aligned and linked to national and REC level quality policies. The
draft AQP document, which is now under RECs scrutiny, will be submitted for
consideration and adoption by the STC-MIT in 2020. It is also expected that the quality
policy will be instrumental in enabling AfCFTA State Parties to address challenges
related to sanitary and phytosanitary measures, technical and non-tariff barriers to
trade in general. The remaining Services Sectors and the Regulatory Cooperation
Frameworks will be finalized by June 2020.

              d. Africa Mining Vision (AMV)

129. The Africa Mining Vision (AMV), adopted by the Assembly in 2009, recognises
that the mineral sector in Africa provides a plethora of potential upstream,
downstream, and side stream linkages with higher-value industrial and services
activities. It is through value chains that countries and regions will be in a better
position to insert themselves into the higher value activities and connect their
endowments with sectors of the future. The Commission has therefore continued to
support Member States, RECS and other Stakeholder in domesticating the tenets of
the AMV. Some of the key interventions include:

   i) Supporting efforts by RECs in the development of regional mineral value chains
        for industrial development. Work is on-going in SADC, EAC and ECOWAS;
   ii) Finalizing the drafting of the first ever African Mineral and Energy Resource
        Classification System which will be a universally acceptable and internationally
        applicable scheme for the classification, management and reporting mineral,
        petroleum, renewable energy, anthropogenic resources and injection projects;
   iii) Developing an Artisanal and Small Scale Mining Financial Inclusion Strategy
        which is aimed at contributing to Member States’ economic transformation and
        sustainable development by strengthening legal and regulatory frameworks to
        promote financial inclusion mechanisms and services to the ASM sector;
   iv) Finalizing the drafting of a Model Law for mineral fiscal policy and regulations
        to act as a guide to Member States in reviewing Mineral regimes in line with the
        principles of the AMV.

130. After the adoption by Assembly in January 2016 of the Statutes establishing
the African Minerals Development Center (AMDC) as a Specialized Agency of the
African Union, the Assembly further decided in July 2018 that the AMDC Secretariat
be hosted by Guinea. It also directed that the AMDC Secretariat move to the
Commission by the end of September 2018 for the interim period of not more than one
(1) year to allow the finalization of the Hosting Agreement, setting up the Governance
Structure as well as the ratification process.

131. Consequently, the AMDC was officially handed over to the Commission on 15
February 2019, as part of fulfilling the relevant policy organs decisions. To facilitate a
seamless transition process, in preparation for the official move to the Republic of
Guinea as a Specialised Agency of the African Union, the Commission continued to
negotiate the AMDC Hosting Agreement and assess the premises to house the AMDC
Secretariat. The Commission has also established a joint lobbying mechanism to
motivate Member States to sign and ratify AMDC Statutes. Currently six (6) countries
have signed and three have ratified the Statutes. Finally, the Commission is finalizing
-----------------------Page 30 End-----------------------

                                                                    EX.CL/1214(XXXVI)
                                                                              Page 28

the development of AMDC Business Plan which provides a clear vision (as part of
AMDC organizational strategy), including assessment of human resources, actionable
programmatic activities, financial projections and modelling and a framework for
mobilizing financial resources.

              e. Customs Cooperation and Trade Facilitation

132. In the area of customs cooperation and trade facilitation, the Commission
continued to facilitate and coordinate the different workshops and meetings as
directed by the Subcommittee of Directors General of Customs (AUSCDGC) and
implement the recommendations of the 11th Ordinary Meeting of the Subcommittee
of Directors General of Customs held in September 2019. The top most priority of the
Commission in the area of Customs Cooperation for 2019 was the development of the
AU Trade Facilitation Strategy in line with international instruments and best practices
such as the WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement and the World Customs Organization
Revised Kyoto Convention and its adoption by the AU Organs. This initiative will
generate closeness in developing similar policies that will, as much as possible be
implemented by each country and RECs using their existing initiatives, while in on
inputs from one another.

133. The Draft AU Trade Facilitation Strategy was noted by the 2nd STC Meeting
on Trade, Industry and Minerals in January 2019, and the STC recommended that a
joint meeting between the AU Sub-Committee of the Directors General of Customs
and the AfCFTA Sub-Committee of Trade Facilitation, Customs Cooperation and
Transit be convened to finalize the Trade Facilitation Strategy and its Implementation
Modalities before its consideration and adoption by its next meeting. The Strategy is
currently being finalized for subsequent presentation to the joint meeting mentioned
as above. The Commission continued with the spirit of promoting trade facilitation by
organizing the 4th Customs Experts Trade Facilitation Forum in August 2019 in Accra,
Ghana under the theme, “Implementing Single Window Systems for Improved Trade
Facilitation in Africa”.

134. Finally, the Commission organized the 11th Sub-Committee of Directors
General of Customs meeting that was held from 16 to 20 September 2019 in Kampala,
Uganda. The objectives was to reflect and exchange views on the theme “The Entry
into Force of the Agreement Establishing the African Continental Free Trade Area
(AfCFTA) -Implications to African Customs Administrations” and to review the work
done by the various Customs Technical Working Groups for the period November
2018 to September 2019, in addressing the issues in the Trade Facilitation Cluster of
the Action Plan on Boosting Intra-African Trade (BIAT).

   II.    Agricultural Productivity and Production: Implementation of
          CAADP

           a. Supporting Countries and Regional Systems

135. The fifteen (15) Member States of ECOWAS have been supported in the
process of developing Malabo-compliant National Agricultural Investment Plans
(NAIPs). Eight others from Southern and Central Africa are also receiving analytical
support to develop their NAIPs. In May 2019, AUC-AUDA carried out an Independent
-----------------------Page 31 End-----------------------

                                                                    EX.CL/1214(XXXVI)
                                                                              Page 29

Technical Review of the Agriculture Sector Growth and Transformation Strategy of
Kenya. The exercise was meant to ensure that every possible action has been
accounted for to realize the objectives and targets laid out in the Strategy and defined
in the CAADP/Malabo Agenda. In order to support Member States and RECs in
identification of priority value chains as part of the Malabo Domestication process, the
Commission, in partnership with UNECA, has developed draft Guidelines on Regional
Agricultural Value Chain Development, which was endorsed by the 3rd STC in October
2019. In the same vein, Country Agribusiness Partnership Framework (CAPF) was
established to assist Member States in the domestication of Malabo commitments and
boosting private sector participation in Africa's agricultural transformation.

136. Under the AU-EU Partnership, the Political Declaration of the 3rd Conference
of Ministers of Agriculture that took place in June 2019 in Rome, Italy, committed to
building a critical mass of socio-economic modelling capacity among Member States
so as to enhance agricultural transformation through sharing evidence, critical
knowledge, experiences, methodologies and approaches in sustainable agriculture.
To this end, the Pan-Africa Network for Economic Analysis Policies (PANAP) was
launched. So far, seven Member States, namely: Kenya, Ethiopia, Côte d’Ivoire, Niger,
Senegal, Tanzania and Togo have benefitted from its activities.

           b. Enhancing Food Security and Nutrition through Accelerated
              Implementation of the Declaration on Hunger Free Africa by 2025

137. The Commission organized a workshop to mobilize partners support in May
2019 in Addis Ababa. Following the launch of the continental Framework for
Sustainable Agricultural Mechanization in Africa in October 2019, an action plan for its
implementation was drafted. On the 15th October 2019, in Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina
Faso, the Commission brought together Governments, UN agencies, private sector,
civil society, women leaders of the rural world, and other partners in the agricultural
value chain to inaugurate the first monument symbolizing the campaign to banish the
hand-held hoe to the museum. It was a response to the call made by Dr. Nkosazana
Dlamini Zuma, former Chairperson of the AU Commission, on relegating the hand-
held hoe to the museum at the Johannesburg Summit in June 2015. This is part of the
support to Member States to develop and implement their national agricultural
mechanization strategies towards boosting agricultural productivity and enhance food
security. Likewise, the Commission has set up a Task Force to review progress on the
2006 Abuja Declaration on Fertilizer for the African Green Revolution, and to prepare
for a follow up Summit in 2020 on Fertilizer and Soil Health.

138. In the effort to achieve the commitment to ending hunger by 2025, by cutting
down stunting to 10 percent and underweight to 5 percent, the Commission is pushing
for accelerating and scaling up the implementation of nutrition sensitive agriculture
strategies through bio fortification, industrial food fortification and increased
production, market access and consumption of the diversified and nutrient-dense
crops. In a bid to encourage Member States to align with a common policy, vision and
priorities, the Commission has drafted a “Declaration on Upscaling Biofortification and
Food Fortification in Africa”, which has recently been adopted by the Third STC on
Agriculture, Rural Development, Water and Environment (ARDWE) for the
endorsement of the Assembly in February 2020.

                                                                               Page 30

139. Regarding international instruments, a notable milestone has been realized
during 2019 in the mobilization and engagement of Member States to build consensus
on the negotiations on the agreement to enhance the functioning of the Multilateral
System of Access and Benefit-sharing of the International Treaty on Plant Genetic
Resources for Food and Agriculture. Additionally, the Commission facilitated the
process with technical backstopping in the development of a range of measures that
will increase user-based payments and contributions to the Benefit-sharing Fund in a
sustainable and predictable long-term manner. On seed quality assurance,
negotiations have reached the final stage with Kenya Plant Health Inspectorate, the
Centre of Phytosanitary Excellence, to operationalize the Forum for African Seed
Testing (FAST). This is key in improving access to quality seed for small scale farmers
on the continent as well as adherence to international standards espoused in the
International Seed Testing Association guidelines.

140. On Water Governance, collaboration has been harnessed at global and
continental level to advocate for adaptation of agricultural and food systems to mitigate
the impacts of water scarcity and climate change in order to avert food and water
insecurity. As a member of the Working Group of the Global Framework on Water
Scarcity in Agriculture (WASAG), the Commission joined other partners to hold events
at the World Water Week to share the commitments of the first WASAG International
Forum that was held in Cabo Verde in March 2019. The events focused on practical,
collaborative and innovative solutions and tools, including the WASAG Investment
Framework to facilitate greater access by all to finance for agriculture water projects
in the context of climate change.

      On Sanitary and Phytosanitary Standards (SPS)

141. In support to the implementation of the Annex 7 of the AfCFTA Agreement, the
Commission developed a continental SPS policy framework that was endorsed by the
3rd STC on ARDWE. This policy framework will support Member States to work
together towards a modern, coherent, and integrated SPS system supportive of food
security, shared prosperity, and health for all Africans.

142. The Commission co-organized with the EU, the 3rd AU-EU Ministers of
Agriculture Conference in Rome on 21 June 2019 under the theme ‘Promoting
sustainable regional agri-food value chains’. At the end of the conference, a political
Declaration and Agenda Action were signed, which will guide the AU-EU cooperation
in agriculture over the next two years.

           c. Strengthening Mutual Accountability and Biennial Review Process

143. Following the submission of the Inaugural Biennial Review (BR) Report to the
Assembly in 2018, the Commission and AUDA-NEPAD formed a BR Task Force. The
aim was to constructively critique the BR process, indicators, and methods - including
the scorecard weighting system - with the goal of improving subsequent BRs. Eight
(8) Technical Working Groups (TWGs), including technical experts from various
institutions, were formed and organized around the performance areas of the Malabo
Declaration.

144.    A new Web-based Data Entry and Management Tool called the electronic

                                                                               Page 31

biennial review (e-BR) was established as a brand-new feature of the 2019 BR
process. Similarly, the BR Task Force on Communications, in collaboration with
different partners, developed the “CAADP Malabo Biennial Review Dashboard: 2019
Highlight Indicators” to provide to the policy organs a snapshot of twenty-two
highlighted indicators from the 2019 report. The Task Force partners also created the
Interactive CAADP Biennial Review Toolkit, a dynamic online resource to allow
diverse users to navigate the results of the BR. The Commission and AUDA-NEPAD
organized a peer-to-peer experience sharing and learning platform for national
CAADP BR focal persons. The event offered a platform for CAADP BR focal persons
to exchange on their national BR experiences and review the 2019 BR reporting
roadmap, including 2019 BR technical guidelines, methodologies, and country
reporting template. Following all these joint efforts, the second BR report, including 22
indicators, was adopted by the 3rd STC in October 2019.

    Policy Framework and Reform Strategy for Fisheries and Aquaculture in
     Africa (PFRS)

145. The PFRS was formulated with the purpose of facilitating coherent policy
development for the sustainable management of fisheries and aquaculture resources
in AU Member States. The African Fisheries Reform Mechanism (AFRM) established
in 2014 to coordinate implementation of the PFRS, was reviewed and endorsed by the
3rd STC on Agriculture, Rural Development, Water and Environment convened from
21 to 25 October 2019 in Addis Ababa. Also endorsed by the STC was Africa’s Blue
Economy framework developed to midwife an inclusive and sustainable blue economy
that has great potential and a significant contributor to continental transformation and
growth. The blue print covers 5 thematic areas that are critical vector for Sustainable
Blue Economic Growth. They are: fisheries, aquaculture, conservation and
sustainable aquatic ecosystems; shipping/transportation, trade, ports, maritime
security, safety and enforcement; coastal and maritime tourism, climate change,
resilience, environment, infrastructure; sustainable energy and mineral resources and
innovative industries; and polices, institutional and governance, employment, job
creation and poverty eradication, and innovative financing.

    Sustainable Utilization, Management            and   Conservation of        Animal
     Resources and their Ecosystems

146. Five (5) regional gene banks (covering all AU regions) for the sustainable
conservation of Animal Genetic Resources (AnGR) in all AU Member States, were
equipped and officially handed over to the respective regions. These gene banks will
provide cryo-conservation facilities for African AnGR. The Animal Genetic Resources
Characterization, Inventory and Monitoring (AnGR-CIM) tool and the African Animal
Genetic Resources Information System (AAGRIS), a module of the Animal Resources
Information System version 3 (ARIS 3) were officially launched.

    Veterinary Governance and Animal Health Systems

147. The Commission finalized the development of the Animal Health Strategy for
Africa (AHSA) aimed at enhancing the contribution of the animal resources sector to
livelihoods and improvement of public health through enhanced veterinary service
delivery. AHSA was endorsed by the 3rd STC on ARDWE in October 2019, Addis

Ababa, alongside the African Union Framework on Antimicrobial Resistance Control
2020 - 2025. The latter seeks to improve surveillance of Antimicrobial Resistance
(AMR) organisms among humans, animals, and plants; delay emergence and limit
transmission; and mitigate harm among patients infected with AMR organisms.

148. With regard to the development and dissemination of African Common
Positions on various areas of Animal Health and Trade in Animals and Animal
products; 10 out of 12 Common Positions on priority animal health standards
developed through an AU Commission supported process. They were accepted by
the 87th General Session of the OIE (World Organization for Animal Health) in May
2019, in Paris. 16 out of the 18 Common Positions on priority food safety standards
developed through the support of the Commission were accepted by the 42nd Session
of the Codex Alimentarius Commission (CAC), in July 2019, in Geneva. In addition,
23 experts from various Member States and RECs were supported to participate in
the sessions of OIE, CAC and the WTO SPS Committee to present various Common
Positions and Trade Concerns.

    Pan African Vaccine Center (PANVAC)

149. As part of its certification of veterinary vaccines, the AU-PANVAC has received
a total of 450 vaccines and biologicals for testing, 72% of which were from Africa.
Biologicals tested included diluent, and vaccine production starting materials such as
sera, vaccine seeds and cells. Moreover, the Centre has recently validated a new test
for Contagious Caprine Pleuropneumonia (CCPP). To support vaccine producing
laboratories, biologicals reagents such as cells, vaccine seeds and sera as well as ten
Peste des Petits Ruminants ELISA kits for antibodies detection were distributed to AU
Member States laboratories upon request.

150. Since its inauguration in January 2018, the Rinderpest holding facilities for
Africa, a total of 9590 vials of Rinderpest Emergency vaccines amounting to 959000
doses were recently transferred to the custody of AU-PANVAC by the National
Veterinary Institute (NVI) of Ethiopia. It brings up the total number of doses of
Rinderpest Emergency vaccines at the AU Continental Vaccine Bank to 2, 470, 400
doses. The vaccines were re-certified by the Pirbright Institute and were found to be
still potent. The restocking of the Continental Vaccine Bank with 10 million doses of
new Batches of vaccines is expected soon.

151. Besides, the Centre has organized the 4th AU-PANVAC Steering Committee
meeting in July 2019, South Africa; workshop on intensification of Newcastle disease
control technology for enhancement of village chicken production, in October 2019,
Nigeria; Veterinary Vaccine Regulatory Harmonization Meeting for Continental Free
Trade” in November 2019 in Nairobi; and PPR cross-border harmonisation workshop
for countries in the Lake Chad region, in December 2019, in Cameroon. In its various
activities, AU-PANVAC has worked in collaboration with a number of partners,
including Pirbright Institute, United Kingdom Defence and Threat Reduction Agency,
USA; KYEEMA foundation, Australia; Abu Dhabi Food control authority on capacity
building for vaccine and diagnostic reagent production that indicated a possibility to
produce vaccines in Africa for the UAE; and OIE (World Organization for Animal
Health) on sustainable laboratories and innovation in Paris.

      Pan-African Tsetse and Trypanosomiasis Eradication Campaign (PATTEC)

152. In its ongoing efforts to eliminate the burden of tsetse and trypanosomiasis on
the African continent, AU-PATTEC continued to take a leading role in initiating,
organizing, supporting and coordinating the campaign for the progressive creation of
Tsetse and Trypanosomiasis (T&T) free areas. Towards that direction, it embarked on
training fourteen national PATTEC Coordinators from various Member States in skills
and knowledge on principles of Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK);
and twenty-three others in the application of open source Geographical Information
System technology in T&T projects.

153. Monitoring and evaluation missions on the status of implementation of the
PATTEC initiative were undertaken to Zambia (10-14 June 2019), Ghana (30 July – 2
August) and Kenya (9-12 September 2019). One of the key outputs of the missions is
the endorsement by the countries visited to integrate T&T programmes in their
formative rural development initiatives. Recognizing the key role of RECs in
accelerating regional integration of T&T interventions and in mobilizing the required
resources, AU-PATTEC undertook to deepen engagements with them. During the
period under review, consultative meetings were held with EAC (4-6 March 2019) and
SADC (7-9 August 2019) to support them in developing regional project proposals and
to enhance ownership, coordination and sustainability of T&T programmes at regional
levels.

154. AU-PATTEC recognizes the transformative power of partnerships in efforts
designed to reduce T&T burden. To this effect, PATTEC undertook a number of joint
activities regarding T&T control, notably with the International Atomic Energy Agency
(IAEA) which supported PATTEC to develop a communication strategy for resource
mobilization, World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) and WHO. AU-PATTEC also
engaged with a wide range of stakeholders through a consultative meeting to develop
a roadmap for updating the tsetse distribution map. In collaboration with an NGO
called PATH, in April 2019, AU-PATTEC supported DRC to develop its advocacy
strategy for the elimination of human sleeping sickness in that country.


      Enhanced Resilience of Production Systems to Climate Change and
       Improved Agricultural Risk Management

155. With the recognition that Climate Smart Agriculture (CSA) can enhance
production and productivity and thereby achieve food security and build resilience and
adaptation to climate change, the Commission assisted 9 Member States (Botswana,
Cameroon, Ghana, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia) to
prepare project Concept Notes for submission to Green Climate Fund (GCF) for
support to scale up CSA. As countries are at different stages of preparing the Concept
Notes, so far, GCF has reviewed and accepted the submissions by 3 Member States
(Botswana, Kenya and Tanzania). Furthermore, support has been provided to eight
(8) countries (Angola, Botswana, Eswatini, Gabon, Lesotho, Namibia, Zambia and
Zimbabwe) to mainstream resilience to climate change in the process of developing
their respective National Agriculture Investment Plan (NAIP).

Change (UNFCCC) negotiations and benefit from climate financing mechanisms, the
African Group of Negotiators Expert Support (AGNES) on Agriculture has also been
supported to convene its Pre-COP consultative and strategic meetings. Technical
papers that capture the specific feature of African agriculture and its need for
adaptation measures and at the same time respond to the roadmap of the Koronivia
Joint Work on Agriculture (KJWA) were commissioned and the findings informed the
submissions of African countries to UNFCCC. The Commission has also given a
special focus to the agriculture component of the Nationally Determined Contributions
(NDCs) of African countries and organized two trainings in collaboration with AUDA-
NEPAD to enhance its understanding and implementation.

          d. Partnership for Aflatoxin Control in Africa (PACA)

157. The Commission continued to engage in piloting aflatoxin control in six Member
States Nigeria, Malawi, Senegal, Tanzania, The Gambia and Uganda in 2019. All
these countries have mainstreamed aflatoxins in their national agriculture investment
plans and other national frameworks. In Tanzania, a USD 20 million grant project - the
Tanzania Initiative for Prevention of Aflatoxin Control (TANIPAC) -, initiated and
developed with the support of the Commission, following outbreaks of acute aflatoxin
poisoning in two regions of the country, has been launched. Similarly, with the support
of the Commission, the Aflatoxin Control for Improved Competitiveness of the
Groundnut Value Chains of Malawi (AMIC) was launched in Malawi and is working to
boost exports of groundnuts, which have hampered by aflatoxin contamination. In
addition, the Commission is providing support to the ECOWAS Commission to
implement the ECOWAS Aflatoxin Control Regional Action Plan (EACAP) aimed at
harmonizing aflatoxin standards at the regional level.

158. The Commission co-organized the first AU/FAO/WHO International Food
Safety Conference (IFSC) under the theme “The Future of Food Safety: Transforming
knowledge into action for people, economies and the environment” from 12 to 13
February 2019. This meeting saw the participation of 600 stakeholders from over 140
countries, bringing food safety discussions in Africa and the world at the centre of
policy dialogues to counter the menace of unsafe food to public health. The AU Special
Event on Trade in Safe Food in Free Trade Areas organized by the Commission as
part of the plenary sessions captured experiences in food safety governance in free
trade areas with particular reference to the AfCFTA.

159. The Commission launched the Africa Food Safety Index (AFSI) for
mainstreaming food safety tracking and capacity building in Africa through the CAADP
Malabo Biennial Review mechanism. The Commission has supported Member States
to assess food control systems and strengthen preparedness and functionality of food
safety systems to protect consumer health and promote trade. In 2019, the
Commission trained more than 300 food safety experts, CAADP focal points and
CODEX focal points on food safety indicators within AFSI for data collection and
reporting. With the technical support of the Commission, 49 countries reported on the
Biennial Review and provided data for the AFSI in 2019.

                                                                   EX.CL/1214(XXXVI)
                                                                             Page 35

160. In 2019, the AU-SAFGRAD, in collaboration with the government of Burkina
Faso, organised from 25 to 27 July 2019, a High Level Policy Dialogue on the
Migration, Land Degradation and Sustainable Development in the Sahel G5 Countries,
aimed at enabling the Sahel G5 Member States to come up with common
understanding to facilitate coherent management of migration in the region, with
specific topics and their impact, such as on environment protection, sustainable
livelihood production, pastoralist promotion. In partnership with the Arab League
through the Arab Fund for Technical Assistance to African Countries (AFTAAC), a
Capacity building training for 17 early and mid-career researchers and scientists
targeting public agricultural research institutions in 16 French-Speaking Member
States took place at the Regional Training Centre for Water Sector (RTCWS) in Cairo,
Egypt, focusing on Climate Smart Agriculture for Drylands.

161. The Commission co-organized with UNCCD Secretariat in August 2019, in
South Africa, a preparatory meeting for the UNCCD Conference of the Party COP14
to be held in India. Science and Technical Correspondents (STC) from 11 African
countries participated along with the UNCCD focal points from 30 Members States. A
set of recommendations was prepared, including African common position to be
defended in New Delhi.

162. Further, the Africa Union Framework for Irrigation Development and Agricultural
Water Management (IDAWM) has been developed, validated and endorsed by the
STC in October 2019. It provides a continental blueprint to mainstream irrigation
development and agricultural water management programs and activities in Member
States and RECs.
The Commission has led preparation of a continental Guidelines/Instrument to
strengthen and promote the development of pastoralism to prevent conflicts between
farmers and pastoralists in Africa. This document was produced through collaborative
efforts with RECs and was validated at a workshop hosted by COMESA in November
2019 in Lusaka, Zambia.

          f. Inter-African Phytosanitary Council (IAPSC)

163. Due to its wide agro-ecological zones, Africa has a huge potential to produce a
staggering range of agricultural commodities if pests and disease are put under control
not to affect plants. Consequently, Member States need to invest significant resources
to combating pests so as to maintain Africa’s plant health status and maintain a
biosecurity system. This is made more necessary as international trade, travel and
market demands take a more stringent view of pest status. In this regard, Member
States governments, farmers and agro-industries face increased competition for
infrastructure and financial resources.

164. It is against this background that the IAPSC continued to reflect on the
challenges that African National Plant Protection Organizations (NPPOs) will face in
future, while pursuing development and coordination of Africa plant health policies.
Thus, the strategic plant health issues at hand considered during 2019 include:

      i) Enhancing compliance of AU Member States with International Standards
         for Phytosanitary Measures (ISPMs), regulations, standards setting
         processes and operational procedures;
-----------------------Page 38 End-----------------------

                                                                          EX.CL/1214(XXXVI)
                                                                                    Page 36

           ii) Mitigating impacts and risks of pandemic and exotic invasive plant pest
                species on livelihoods and biodiversity in Africa and facilitating
                phytosanitary response to new or changed plant health risk of Africa;
           iii) Promoting human capacity development on Integrated Pest Management
                (IPM), Pest Risk Analysis (PRA), plant health enforcement best practices,
                pesticides management and national surveillance for emergency plant pests
                and development of Public Private Partnerships between IAPSC and
                stakeholders to support continental plant health efforts;
           iv) Monitoring, analysing and reporting on the status of plant protection in Africa
                on regular basis, with a particular focus on pest outbreaks and pest
                distribution;
           v) Sensitizing policy and decision-makers on the contribution of improved and
                strengthened plant pest management to the economy of Africa.

165. A number of workshops and consultations on mainstreaming Sanitary and
Phytosanitary Measures (SPS) in country CAADP information systems were
undertaken to build Member States’ capacity in Integrated Pest Management
strategies and implementation of IPM for sustainable agriculture; IPPC Regional
workshop for Africa that reviewed the draft ISPMs. Crop protection experts and IAPSC
observed that efforts to control the diseases and insect pests are still fragmented, with
actions limited to some regions, allowing the epidemic to persist.

166. It is to be noted that poor adoption of control measures, limited capacity for
early and accurate detection, non-effective compliance with the International
Standards for Phytosanitary Measures by Member States and inadequate regulatory
and phytosanitary management measures across Africa undermined efforts to deal
with the problem. In order to help mitigating the risk of exotic pests being introduced
into Africa, there is an urgent need to set up the continental plant health surveillance
programme, with hazard site surveillance, surveillance reference group, the various
national plant health surveillance strategy, agro industry-specific surveillance plan,
and surveillance diagnostic and reporting tool.

    III.      Environmental Sustainability

               a. Africa’s Engagement in Global Climatic Change Negotiations

167. The Commission, in February 2019, on the margins of the AU Summit and in
collaboration with the Government of Gabon, organized the CAHOSCC meeting; while
on the margins of the Africa Climate Week in March 2019, the NDC Support to
countries was launched. On another aspect, draft Terms of Reference for the review
and validation of the Africa Climate Change Strategy were prepared. These were in
addition to the support offered to some youth and women under the CAHOSCC Youth,
and CAHOSCC Women and Gender Programmes on Climate Change respectively.
Work programmes for youth, gender and women were updated; and support was given
to youth and women to raise and defend issues relevant to them during the Climate
Change negotiations.

      Maritime Strategy (Blue Economy)

168.       In accordance with the Decision of the Assembly adopted at its 22nd Ordinary
-----------------------Page 39 End-----------------------

                                                                     EX.CL/1214(XXXVI)
                                                                               Page 37

Session, wherein it declared the 2015-2025 decade as the "Decade of African Seas
and Oceans”, and the date of 25 July as “African Day of Seas and Oceans”, the
Commission celebrated the 2019 African Day of Seas and Oceans with an event held
on Thursday, 25 July 2019, at the AU Headquarters, under the theme “Enhancing
Africa’s role in a Globally binding instrument on Marine biological diversity in areas
beyond national jurisdictions”. The 2019 celebrations focused on bringing awareness
to Member States on the ongoing negotiations of an international legally binding
instrument under the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) on the conservation
and sustainable use of marine biological diversity of areas beyond national
jurisdictions (BBNJ). The event addressed the necessity of having a Common African
Position in the ongoing negotiations of a BBNJ instrument, taking into consideration
the objectives of adopted AU legal frameworks and strategies in force.

169. In the same vein, within its mandate to implement of the 2050 AIM Strategy,
the Commission participated in the 3rd Session of the Intergovernmental Conference
from 19 to 30 August 2019 in New York (USA). This Negotiation Forum constituted an
excellent concrete opportunity to raise awareness on AU Policy and Legal Instruments
governing the African Maritime domain.

170. In this respect, the African Group in New York expressed the wish of having a
political declaration made by the AU Assembly, detailing the priorities of Africa in the
ongoing negotiations for the BBNJ Legal Binding Instrument. This action was strongly
recommended, to ensure that some of the red lines for the Group, including the
Common Heritage of Mankind principle and the Access and Benefit Sharing
Mechanism (ABSM) are strongly captured and endorsed by the highest decision-
making organ of the AU.

171. During the year under review, the Commission also developed the African
Union Blue Economy Strategy, which was subsequently adopted by the Third Ordinary
Session of the STC on Agriculture, Rural Development, Water and Environment on 24
October 2019. It will ensure the completion of the institutionalization of the Blue
Economy file in the coming months. Meanwhile, the Commission co-organised with
the Government of Norway the first ever Africa-Norshipping Event on Oslo, Norway in
May 2019. Meanwhile, AUDA-NEPAD also developed a continental programme on
Blue Economy that was validated by various stakeholders including 8 RECs; and
related continental discussion took place within the context of AfCFTA.

           b. Conserving Africa’s wild fauna and flora

172. The Commission organized, on the margins of the AU Wildlife Experts Group
Meeting, held in Addis Ababa, from 10 to 12 April 2019, a side event on Corruption

                                                                    EX.CL/1214(XXXVI)
                                                                              Page 44

institutions and agencies working in education in Africa. The Commission has
collaborated with UNESCO to help ease the reporting burden of Member States, as
they subscribe to both continental and global (UN) development frameworks, in this
case, CESA and SDG4. Further engagement with the UNESCO Institute for Statistics
(UIS) was planned and executed in March 2019, under which ways of streamlining
monitoring and evaluation instruments were proposed and discussed. The division of
responsibilities for the benefit of Member States were also agreed upon.

197. The Commission also organized the second exhibition of innovations in
education in Gaborone, Botswana in August 2019, which was aimed to enhance
access, quality, impact and employability, and also making STEM more accessible,
especially for girls. Out of 455 submissions mostly from African Youth, 11 top
innovations were selected and the innovators won cash prizes, with the 1st prize being
50,000 USD; next 20,000 USD; 10,000 USD; and eight prizes of 5,000 USD each. As
an established practice, the winning innovators will be assisted to access potential
financiers to help grow their enterprises in education innovation. As further
deliverables from the Expo, the Commission has developed an African Education
Innovators Platform online. The Education Innovations Handbook for the 2018 was
published, which has been subsequently updated to include the 2019 activities.
Rwanda has offered to host the 2020 Innovating Education Expo.


           d. Girls and Women's Education

198. The African Union International Center for Girls’ and Women’s Education in
Africa (AU/CIEFFA) has adopted an inclusive approach towards the implementation
of numerous legal instruments, policies and frameworks pertaining to girls and
women's education. Despite the numerous existing normative frameworks and efforts
made by Member States to implement them, girls and women still lack access and
retention to educational systems due to persisting social norms, harmful and traditional
practices, ineffective policies, poor infrastructure, especially during conflicts and
humanitarian situations.

199. During 2019, the AU/CIEFFA has reflected on the AU Theme of the year
through several meetings, actions and collaboration. The Center held its 3rd High level
Dialogue on "Gender, Education and Protection of schools in Humanitarian settings’’
during the February 2019 Summit, in collaboration with the Department of Political
Affairs and Save the Children. On the advocacy level, AU/CIEFFA held its 2nd
Dialogue with African traditional and religious Leaders in Uganda in June 2019 to re-
define roles and responsibilities of Faith-Based Organizations at community level and
to advocate for the acceleration of girls’ access and retention in educational systems.
Various members of the Council of Traditional Leaders (COTLA) attended this
Dialogue.

support of the AU Theme for 2019. 25 new students have been selected competitively
for the scholarship award. The Intra-Africa Academic mobility programme sponsored
by the EU with representatives from the Departments of Social and Political Affairs
completed the selection process for the 5th Call. So far, 97 Universities from 38
Member States have benefitted, with 1280 Africans having received full scholarships
for masters, PhD and Staff mobility programmes.

201. Efforts have been made in 2019 to publish the research outputs sponsored
through the Nyerere and Intra-Africa mobility schemes, to be disseminated for greater
impact. In implementation of the AU Strategy for Harmonisation of Higher Education,
the Commission has continued to publicise the Addis Convention on mutual
recognition of qualifications. It is worthy to note that 17 Member States have now
signed and 6 ratified the Convention. The Continental African Standard and Guidelines
for Quality Assurance in higher education was completed and is in the process of
publication. Furthermore, a consolidated report on the third institutional evaluations
using the African Quality Rating Mechanism (AQRM) for 15 higher education
institutions has been finalized and published.

           f. Teacher Development

202. Looking at the need to strengthen Teacher Regulatory agencies, the
Commission initiated in 2019 a study to develop a Continental Teacher Qualification
Framework in partnership with the African Federation of Teacher Regulatory Agencies
(AFTRA). The work includes development of Teacher Professional Standards and
Guidelines, which is necessary for establishing teaching as a distinguished profession
and preferred career. The work was validated in October 2019 with the Inauguration
of the First AU Continental Teacher Prize in which three outstanding Teachers from
Kenya, Uganda and Ghana were awarded, each with 10,000 USD.

203. The AU Continental Teacher Prize processes are designed to identify and
highlight outstanding teachers across the African educational system, and contribute
to development of a compendium of success factors in teaching and learning. It is
aimed to raise the status of the teaching profession and the teacher, and inspire the
best possible candidates to join the teaching profession. It is also aimed to serve as a
catalyst for similar programmes at regional and national levels. The Teacher Prize is
an important and valuable instrument that contributes to the success of Agenda 2063
and the Continental Education Strategy for Africa (CESA).

204. Moreover, Science Technology Engineering and Math (STEM) education and
needs assessments were conducted in Ethiopia, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi and Gabon
for building capacities of teachers to deploy quality education.

           g. Pan-African Institute of Education for Development (IPED)

205. The Pan-African Institute of Education for Development (IPED), which is based
in Kinshasa, serves as the Continental Education Observatory, responsible for
ensuring knowledge based education planning. IPED managed the completion of the
CESA Indicators’ Manual, along with a Monitoring and Reporting Framework, which
was published in September 2019, based on the contributions it received from Member
States and other partners. Data capture instruments have been developed and piloted

in 6 Member States, and the final outcome was released after validation in August
2019.

206. IPED started collaboration with the RECs in March 2019, in order to implement
the platform on Education, Science and Technology and Innovation in Member States
that have weak or non-functional National Education Management Information system
(NEMIS) system. A draft monitoring and evaluation instrument has been developed
for use by CESA Thematic Clusters, for ensuring coordinated implementation and
reporting of partners and key stakeholders, towards a common vision. In May 2019,
IPED, in partnership with UNHCR, Save the Children and UNICEF, held a consultation
on mainstreaming refugees into NEMIS system in Kampala, Uganda, as part of the
implementation of the AU theme for 2019.

    Policy Framework and Plan of Action on Ageing (2002)

210. In recognition of the limitations of the AU Plan, Member States, in the First STC
on Social Development, Labour and Employment (STC-SDLE-1) in April 2015,
formally recommended a review and revision of the Policy Framework and Plan of
Action on Ageing (2002). This was adopted by the Executive Council in June 2015,
while requesting the Commission to align the Plan of Action to the Protocol. The
Review and update of the Policy Framework and Plan of Action of Action on Ageing
(2002) has commenced with the convening of the 1st Drafting Experts Group on

dispatched to Gaborone, Botswana in February, Dakar, Senegal in May, Harare in
September, and the PAP in May. Collaboration with the African Commission on
Human and Peoples’ Rights in Kigali, Rwanda reached out to around 45 Member
States. In October, an Advocacy Workshop was held where 30 Member States
participated. The Workshop resolved that each Member State should work towards
ratifying the Protocol by December 2020 for it to come into force after the minimum 15
ratifications would have been deposited.

          c. The African Union Campaign to End Child Marriage

212. The AU Campaign to End Child Marriage, which was launched in May 2014,
has been instrumental in accelerating an end to child marriage. In addition to key
events and activities undertaken since its launch, the AU Campaign to End Child
Marriage carried out in 2019 several activities, including monitoring and evaluation
visits to two Member States, namely: Mauritius and Namibia.

213. Two major events were organized by the Campaign in 2019, namely: the
Conference on Eliminating Child Marriage and Female Genital Mutilation and the

diseases. Looking back on 2019, Africa CDC focused on enhancing its reach to
Member States by facilitating the signing of agreements by Gabon and Zambia to host
the African CDC Regional Collaborating Centres in Central and Southern regions
respectively. Guidance and support were also provided to Member States in the
establishment and strengthening of their National Public Health Institutes. Further,
through the Africa CDC RISLNET initiative, 10 laboratories from Member States in
Central Africa Region were networked to facilitate sharing of their public health assets
for training and data sharing.

215. As one of its core mandates, Africa CDC has financially and technically
supported Member States in multiple disease outbreak responses. In 2019, Africa
CDC supported five outbreaks. A major effort has been Africa CDC’s support to D.R.
Congo to control the Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) Outbreak in the country. As such,
Africa CDC has deployed more than 65 experts since the beginning of the outbreak in
August 2019 as well as procured and deployed laboratory equipment and supplies. In
addition to the direct support for outbreak response, Africa CDC also reinforced
pandemic preparedness in Eastern and Central Africa regions and the establishment
of Emergency Operation Centres in Uganda and South Sudan. Furthermore, jointly
with WHO/AFR, and in partnership with the DRC, Africa CDC convened a high-level
Ministerial meeting for Ministers of Health of DRC and neighbouring at-risk Member
States in Goma, DRC, on 21 October 2019, to review and agree on mechanisms for
cross-border collaboration to optimize preparedness and joint response in the advent
of transmission of Ebola and other dangerous pathogens of public health significance
to neighbouring states. A framework of collaboration to coordinate this response has
now been developed and the operationalization of the action plan will be through the
establishment of the Africa Ebola Coordination task force (AfECT) made up of the 10
concerned Member States from the PRC and WHO/AFR.

216. Africa CDC has also facilitated the adoption of the African Common Position on
Antimicrobial Resistance during the STCs for Health and Agriculture. In this regard, a
Ministerial resolution requesting Africa CDC to provide guidance and support Member
States to mobilize resources for strengthening mortality surveillance systems and
CRVS in Africa at the COM5 Ministerial meeting was passed.

217. As one of its priority strategic pillars, Africa CDC has taken major steps in short-
and long-term workforce development for health in the continent. It has launched the
Africa CDC Institute for Workforce Development in 2019 that has provided training on
different public health core functions to candidates selected from Member States.
Further, in collaboration with higher level institutes within the continent, it has built the
capacity of Member States by providing Master Level Epidemiology training.

218. In the past year, Africa CDC has instituted partnerships and collaboration with
multiple regional and national entities that include the World Bank, the Bill and Melinda
Gates Foundation, European CDC, China CDC and USCDC. It also led and facilitated
multiple regional and international dialogues with Member States and Partners in the
areas of risk assessment and risk profiling in infectious disease outbreak, quality of
care, data management, human resources, emergency preparedness and
management, antimicrobial resistance, innovations in diagnostics, one health,
laboratory systems optimization and networks, and biosecurity and biosafety.
Moreover, Africa CDC has launched the Africa Collaborative Initiative to Advance

          e. The Africa Health Strategy (AHS) 2016-2030

219. Following the establishment of the Africa Medicine Agency (AMA) by the
Assembly in January 2019, seven Member States have signed the Treaty. The
Commission continues to urge all Member States to sign and ratify the AMA Treaty
which will comes into force upon the receipt by the Commission of the 15th instrument
of ratification. Towards that goal, guidance documents and manuals were developed
in addition to workshop training on the AU Model Law on Medical Products Regulation
to assist countries to fast track the domestication process. The Commission wishes to
acknowledge and appreciate the ongoing support of the Government of Mali, through
the Honourable Minister of Health and Social Affairs, Michel Sidibe, in the form of
advocacy, geared at encouraging Member States to sign and ratify the Treaty.

220. The Commission fully participated in the United Nations General Assembly
special session on Universal Health Coverage that was held under the theme
“Universal Health Coverage: moving together to build a healthier world’. The
Commission fully aligns itself with the outcome of the General Assembly Resolution
A/RES/74/2. The Commission looks forward to supporting Member States in meeting
commitments that have been made particularly through encouraging them to increase
financial commitment for health and scaled up primary health care interventions.


          f. Catalytic Framework to end AIDS, TB and Eliminate Malaria by

                                                                    EX.CL/1214(XXXVI)
                                                                              Page 50


223. Further, the Commission developed and disseminated Information for Action:
HIV prevention in Africa policy brief highlights the new HIV infection trends. As well,
commitments for actions are developed and shared with Member States. In the
Southern Region, SADC Ministers of Health and HIV/AIDs approved a regional TB
Strategy in November 2019.

    Accountability: Established Accountability and Oversight for Results

224. Forty (40) countries in Africa have developed national malaria control and

                                                                      EX.CL/1214(XXXVI)
                                                                                Page 51


    Plan of Action on Drug Control and Prevention

228. The Commission completed an evaluation of the implementation of the AU Plan
of Action on Drug Control and Crime Prevention (2013-2018) and drafted the revised
AU Plan of Action on Drug Control and Crime Prevention for the period 2019-2023.
Through this action plan, the Commission continues to promote a multi-sectorial,
balanced and integrated approach to drug control cognisant of global challenges
relating to drugs including health, socio-economic wellbeing, crime, terrorism and
security in Member States. Drug use surveillance networks were established in nine
additional countries during the reporting period, bringing the total to 29 out of the 55
African Union Member States.

229. The first report of the Pan African Epidemiology Network on “Drug Use
(PAENDU)” was produced and launched during the 3rd STC on Health, Population
and Drug Control held in Cairo, Egypt from 29 July to 2 August 2019. The Commission
organised the International Consortium of Universities in Drug Demand Reduction
(ICUDDR) Africa Region Catalytic meeting on 3-4 September 2019 in Addis Ababa, to
put in place a leadership, communication and decision-making structures for the
African Chapter of ICUDDR, as well as to select priority activities for each country,
region and the continent. This is part of the Commission’s efforts to support the
development of a network of universities in Africa engaged in the design and
implementation of academic curricula and programs in addiction studies.

230. The African Union participated at the UN Commission on Narcotic Drugs (CND)
in Vienna, Austria from 14 to 22 March 2019 and contributed to the debate on current
drug policy development. The Commission also participated in inter-agency technical
experts working group meetings led by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime
as well as the World Health Organization from 28 to 30 August 2019 at the United
Nations Office in Vienna to discuss strengthening of international drug statistics as
well as priorities for capacity-building activities to improve drug information systems at
the national level.

231. The Commission convened a Continental Meeting from 15 to 17 October 2019
in Port Louis, Mauritius to build the capacity of technical experts from Member States
in drug demand reduction and epidemiology. The meeting reviewed progress by
Member States in implementing evidence-based services to address drug use,
document good practices and emerging challenges with a view to improving policy
formulation and service delivery.          It also discussed operationalization of
recommendations from the third STC on Health, Population and Drug Control held in
Cairo, Egypt (29 July – 2 August 2019), including the alignment of national drug control
frameworks to the revised African Union Plan of Action on Drug Control and Crime
Prevention (2019-2023).

232. On crime prevention, the Commission sensitized Member States on the
emerging crime of Online Child Sexual Exploitation (OCSE) with a view to developing
their capacity and mobilizing political and national level commitment to implement
related programmes. To this end, the first continental Consultation on combatting
Online Child Sexual exploitation was convened in March followed by a Roundtable
Training Session for Member States on 9 June 2019. Further, OCSE issues were

                                                                     EX.CL/1214(XXXVI)
                                                                               Page 52

integrated and mainstreamed into the work of the African Committee of Experts on the
Rights and Welfare of the Child.

233. Commemorations for the International Day Against Drug Abuse and Illicit
Trafficking, also known as the World Drug Day, and the launch of the Annual World
Drug Report were held on 26 June 2019 for the first time at the Commission, as one
of the four hubs worldwide where the official launch took place concurrently. This was
significant as the drug problem transcends all of the African Union’s five regions some
of whom are experiencing a meltdown. Over the past few years, Africa has not only
become a major transit route in the global trade in narcotics, but also a major producer
and consumer. The sharp rise in drug trafficking and use on the continent comes with
unwanted challenges to Member States’ already burdened health care systems and
overall social, economic and security concerns.

        II.   Sport

           a. Coordinate a Peer Review of the Policy Framework for Sustainable
              Development of Sport in Africa (2008-2018)

234. The Commission held the 1st workshop to revise the Policy in Yaoundé,
Cameroun in July, following which the basic parameters for the new Policy for next
decade were established. The process is still ongoing to advocate on the reviewed
Policy and collect feedback with a view to finalizing this document for the consideration
and decision by the STC on YSC in September/October 2020.

           b. Anti-Doping in Sports in Africa

235. The Commission held the Annual Africa Anti-Doping forum in Cape Town,
South Africa in July. A series of recommendations emanated from that forum, of which
among others:

    i) Reiterate the need for compliance to the Anti-Doping Code by all Member
        States;
    ii) Reaffirm the need for values-based education programs to be implemented in
        all countries and Member States to consider curriculum revisions and teacher
        training with anti-doping issues in mind.

236. Member States were urged to provide more support for local National Anti-
Doping Organisations NADOs and Regional Anti-Doping Organisations and regional
RADOs. The Commission also participated in World Anti-Doping Executive Committee
and Foundation Board meeting Canada, and Poland, on 15 May, and 5 to 7 November
2019 respectively as well as in the UNESCO Conference of Parties Meeting in Paris,
France (from 29 September to 1 October 2019).

           c. African Games 2019

237. The 2019 Games took place in the Kingdom of Morocco in August. The
Kingdom of Morocco deserves high appreciation for having put up a commendable
organization of this major continental event, within a short period of 11 months.
However, though the Games were held in a spirit of understanding and collaboration,
-----------------------Page 55 End-----------------------

                                                                  EX.CL/1214(XXXVI)
                                                                            Page 53

some shortcomings have been registered as a number of rules and regulations put in
place were not in conformity with the established instruments.

          d. Quality Physical Education (QPE) in Africa

238. It is to be recalled that the Sixth International Conference of Ministers and
Senior Officials Responsible for Physical Education and Sport held in Kazan, Russia,
on 15 July 2017, adopted the Kazan Action Plan (KAP) on policies on physical
education, physical activity and sport. The KAP marked the commitment to link sport
policy development to the 2030 UN-SDGs as well as support to the overarching sports
policy follow up frameworks for priority areas for international and national multi-
stakeholder cooperation. In order to implement the action plan, the Ministry of Youth
and Sport of the Republic of Madagascar and the National Academy of Sport of
Madagascar organised, from 10 to 13 September 2019, the first Ministerial
Conference on the implementation of the KAP in Africa, taking into account to the
African regional context. The meeting developed some recommendations, including:

   i) Recognizing the opportunity to foster policy coherence in the context of Agenda
        2063, the Sustainable Development Goals, the Sport Policy Framework for
        Sustainable Development of Sport in Africa, and the KAP;
   ii) Acknowledging this Conference as an important step towards the development
        of a comprehensive policy that encompasses the contribution of physical
        education, physical activity and sport to human, social and economic
        development;
   iii) Recognizing the critical role of Quality Physical Education for crosscutting
        development priorities and the need to enhance cooperation between African
        ministers in charge of sport and education.

239. The meeting also recommends that the African Union recognizes H.E Mr. Andry
Rajoelina, President of the Republic of Madagascar, as a Champion of Quality
Physical Education and the implementation of the Kazan Action Plan in Africa.

       III.   Youth Empowerment

          a. AU Roadmap on Harnessing the Demographic Dividend

240. Pursuant to the outcomes and roadmap of the 2017 Theme on “Harnessing the
Demographic Dividend through Investments in Youth,” aimed at empowering young
people, the Commission engaged in the collection of data and the finalization of
indicators across the four pillars of the demographic dividend: Employment and
Entrepreneurship, Education and Skills Development, Health and Wellbeing, and
Rights, Governance and Youth Empowerment. The Status of African Youth Report
was completed in the first quarter of 2019. This Report will help broaden the
knowledge and facilitate information sharing about youth development in Africa.

          b. Pan African Youth Forum and 1 Million by 2021 Initiative

241. The Commission hosted the Pan African Youth Forum from 24 to 27 April 2019
in Addis Ababa, with a view to maintaining the momentum in the implementation of
the AU roadmap on Harnessing the Demographic Dividend and catalyse action for

                                                                      EX.CL/1214(XXXVI)
                                                                                Page 54

youth development in Africa. The Forum brought together about 400 young people
from across the continent and the diaspora to deliberate on key topics, challenges,
opportunities and solutions for issues affecting young people of Africa. During the
forum, the Chairperson of the Commission launched the “one million by 2021
initiative”.

242. The initiative aimed at reaching one million young Africans with a view to
providing them with opportunities in the areas of Education, Employment,
Entrepreneurship and Engagement (4E’s) by the year 2021. The initiative has 12
game-changing pathways that aims at promoting solutions and innovative models on
youth development interventions. During the launch of this initiative in April, a total of
17 private sector actors and development partners pledged to support the initiative
through various concrete interventions across the 4E’s.

           c. The AU Five Year Plan on Youth Empowerment in Africa

243. The Commission has finalized the development of the African Plan of Action for
Youth Empowerment (APAYE) to guide and influence the efforts and contributions of
key partners and stakeholders engaged in youth empowerment on the continent. It is
a successor to the DPoA (2008 - 2018) as a roadmap for the implementation of the
African Youth Charter. APAYE seeks to reinforce the foundations of youth
development, catalyse action at Member States level and accelerate implementation
of flagship programmes linked to the “igno”. The youth mainstreaming framework was
one of the strategic approaches through which the Commission has enhanced
engagement of young people. Through this approach, a multi-sectoral and
interdisciplinary working group on Youth Development has been institutionalized to
leverage on the limited resources available in the promotion of youth development
outcomes. The Commission has strived to build capacities of the Pan African
Parliament last year and the African Peer Review Mechanism (APRM) this year. The
Commission intends to continue reaching out and empowering other AU Organs,
RECs as well as individual Member states on Youth Mainstreaming.

244. Equally, as part of the implementation of the Decent Rural Jobs project,
National Action Plans for rural youth employment and entrepreneurship were
developed and validated in Benin, Cameroon, Malawi and Niger. The project also
equipped 647 youths (males and females) in those countries with skills to engage in
agriculture value chain enterprises.

    Plan of Action for the TVET Decade

245. The Commission finalized the development of the Plan of Action for the African
Decade for Technical, Professional, Entrepreneurial Training and Youth Employment
(2019 – 2028). The Plan of Action articulates strategic actions that will guide and

246. Pursuant to the Assembly’s Decision of July 2017 on the establishment of the
AU Youth Fund and the agreement on an allocation at least equal to 1% of the
-----------------------Page 57 End-----------------------

                                                                    EX.CL/1214(XXXVI)
                                                                              Page 55

Programme Budget of the Commission, the latter conducted a study of related funds
and engaged private sector actors and development stakeholders to define the
specificities of the Youth Fund and identify challenges with similar funds. In this
regard, it engaged a consultancy firm to support the work on defining the architecture
and instrument for the fund. Together, with the AUDA-NEPAD as implementing
partner, the Commission intends to present the draft architecture, institutional
arrangement and instruments for the management of the fund to the Assembly in
February 2020. For coordination purposes, the draft arrangement will ensure that all
youth funding vehicles within the AU, including with the Skills Initiative for Africa
(SIFA), are structured within the fund governance. It is expected that the fund will
become operational in 2020.

     African Union Youth Volunteer Corps (AU-YVC)

247. The AU-YVC is a flagship program of the African Union which recruits, trains
and deploys young African professionals to serve as volunteers for a period of 12
months. The AU-YVC promotes volunteerism as a tool for Youth Empowerment,
Mainstreaming and Participation contributing towards Africa’s Development and
Agenda 2063. Since launch of the program in December 2010, over 800 youth have
been recruited/trained and over 400 deployed across the continent. Furthermore, the
African Union has established a Continental Volunteer Linkage Platform which brings
actors in Member States, civil society and partners engaged in volunteer action to
promote common standards in volunteerism in Africa. The platform also seeks to foster
collaboration towards accelerating the contribution of Volunteerism to Youth
Empowerment through civic engagement and contribution to Agenda 2063.

           d. African Committee of Experts on the Rights and Welfare of the
              Child (ACERWC)

248. It should be noted that currently, 49 Member States out of 55 have ratified the
1990 African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child. In this respect, the
Committee considers Reports submitted and issues Concluding Observations and
Recommendations intended to advise concerned State Parties on measures to be
taken by them in furtherance of the provisions of the Charter. Pursuant to its mandate,
ACERWC carried out the following activities:

    i) Advocacy for the Ratification, Reporting and Domestication and implementation
        of the African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child at National Level;
    ii) Advocacy on the promotion and protection of the rights of the Child, in
        collaboration with other African Union Organs, RECs and UN Agencies.

249. Following an Experts meeting held in July 2019 in Cape Town, South Africa, it
developed a General Comment on Article 22 of the African Charter on the Rights and
Welfare of the Child focusing on children affected by armed conflicts. It undertook a
continental study on the situation of children on the move on ‘mapping the situation of
children on the move within Africa’ and launched the related report on 18 March 2019
during its 33rd Ordinary Session. The study recognizes that, as in the case with adults,
children are not immune to both small-scale and large-scale movement of persons
across the world, either alone or with their parents.

                                                                      EX.CL/1214(XXXVI)
                                                                                Page 56

250. It considered the State Party Reports on the implementation of the Charter and
made concluding Observations and Recommendations to the concerned State
Parties, for their feedback and comments. So far, 39 of the 49 Countries that ratified
the Charter have submitted their initial reports on its implementation. Six counties have
submitted their first and second periodic reports. In 2019, the Committee considered
5 out of the seven State Party Reports and two out of the 3 Complementary Reports
it had planned for the 2019 session. The remaining reports will be considered in the
upcoming 34th session of the Committee scheduled to be held in November.

251. In 2019, out of the 3 planned advocacy missions on the ratification of the African
Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child, only one mission to Sahrawi Arab
Democratic Republic has been undertaken from 28 April to 4 May 2019. It engaged
with Government Officials and Partner Organizations on the ratification of the Charter.
The Committee is planning to undertake another mission to Morocco in December.
The ACERWC conducted Missions to Guinee Conakry, (25 to 27 September 2019),
Republic of Zimbabwe (14 to 16 June 2019) and planned to conduct a mission to
Liberia (6 to 8 November 2019) to monitor the status of the implementation of the
concluding observations and recommendations.

252. The ACERWC mobilized Member States for the commemoration of the Day of
the African Child (DAC) 2019 whose theme was “Humanitarian action in Africa-
Children’s rights first” by developing and sharing a Concept Note to guide Member
States and other stakeholders on how to commemorate the Day. The Continental DAC
has been commemorated from 14 to 15 June 2019 in Ndjamena, Chad, along with a
sensitization training workshop with media and CSOs. The training was to sensitize
the Media and CSOs on the provisions of the Charter, raise public awareness on the
mandate of the Committee and the existing avenues to channel and report child rights
violations.

253. The ACERWC planned to organize two days’ workshop in two RECs to engage
them in the popularization of the Africa’s Agenda for children 2040 and identifying
appropriate mechanisms of engagement on matters related to the cross-border issues
affecting children’s rights. In this regard, the Committee has engaged the Economic
Community of Central African States (ECCAS) in Libreville, Gabon from 04-06
September and the Horn and north of Africa from 31 October to 1 November 2019 in
Asmara, Eritrea Africa affording the opportunity for Partner States to learn about the
various child rights laws, policies and initiatives that exist within the respective RECs.
At the end of the workshops, the ACERWC and the respective RECs identified joint
activities and set areas of focus of collaboration on matters pertaining to children’s
rights in the coming years. Further, the Committee participated in the AU-UN Human
Rights Dialogue from 15 to 16 October and in the AU-EU Human Rights Dialogue on
19 October.

254. ACERWC continues to face the challenge of inadequate legislative and
institutional frameworks to facilitate the implementation of its decisions, coupled with
the lack of capacity for effective implementation, as well as lack of political will from
some Member States to implement the decisions of ACERWC. The limited budgetary
allocation to implement the decisions and recommendations of ACERWC continue to
hinder the work of the Committee. Further, there is lack of collaboration among
Government, Organs and other stakeholders when implementing decisions and
-----------------------Page 59 End-----------------------

                                                                   EX.CL/1214(XXXVI)
                                                                             Page 57

recommendations of ACERWC. This requires a focal point entrusted to implement
them at national level and report accordingly. In this regard, the Six Member States
which have not yet ratified the Charter, namely: Democratic Republic of Congo,
Morocco, Tunisia, Saharawi Arab Democratic Republic, South Sudan, and Somalia,
are urged to expedite the ratification of the Charter.

       IV.     Gender Equality and Women’s Empowerment

             a. Advancing Gender Agenda

255. The Commission presented the 4th Edition of the AU Gender Scorecard, which
were presented to 17 Heads of State and Government at the 32nd Ordinary Session
of the Assembly, held in February 2019, in Addis Ababa, in recognition of progress
made in implementing Gender Equality and Women’s Empowerment (GEWE)
Commitments related to the AU theme of the year. In 2019, the Commission continued
to promote the integration of the AU Common Africa Position on GEWE in international
platforms and participated in the 63rd Session of the United Nations Commission on
the Status of Women (CSW63) as well as the 74th session of the UN General
Assembly held at the UN Headquarters in March and September 2019, respectively.

256. The 10th Anniversary of the AU Gender Pre-Summit was celebrated in an event
co-hosted with the Egypt National Council for Women February, 2019, in Cairo, Egypt.
In the same vein, in July, 2019, a Pre-Summit on “Advancing Women and Girls
Empowerment” was convened in collaboration with the Ministry of Women
Empowerment and Child Protection of the Republic of Niger together with the AU
International Centre for Girls and Women’s Education in Africa (AU/ CIEFFA) in
Niamey, Niger, on the margins of the First Mid-Year Coordination Meeting of the AU
and the Regional Economic Communities (RECs). A Solidarity Mission in Sudan was
undertaken in collaboration with the Office of the Special Envoy on Women, Peace
and Security to support the women of Sudan in their endeavours for a democratic,
peaceful and inclusive Sudan that incorporates women in decision-making at all levels.
An in-country advocacy mission as well as a training on the ratification, domestication
and implementation of the Maputo Protocol followed in November, 2019, in Khartoum,
Sudan to support the institutionalisation of women’s rights in the new government of
Sudan.

257. The 4th STC on Gender Equality and Women’s Empowerment (GEWE) was
convened, along with the Africa Consultative Conference on the Review of
Implementation of the 25th Anniversary of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for
Action (Beijing + 25). On Beijing + 25, the STC adopted the Africa Declaration and key
messages that form part of the Common Africa Position (CAP) to be presented at the
64th Session of the Commission on the Status of Women (CSW64) at the UN
Headquarters in New York in March 2020. The Africa Report will also be integrated
into the global Beijing +25 report, which will be presented at CSW 64.

             b. Mechanisms and Tools for Effective Implementation of GEWE
                Policies

258. Following the adoption of the 2018 Gender Parity Decision, the Commission
designed the Gender Parity 2025 Project. A Retreat was organized in November 2019
-----------------------Page 60 End-----------------------

                                                                   EX.CL/1214(XXXVI)
                                                                             Page 58

to plan for the accelerated implementation of the Parity Project. The outcome of the
Retreat was an action plan to operationalize the Gender Parity Operational Plan that
was agreed to in the first Parity meeting in Dakar in July 2018. To institutionalize
gender equality in policies, programmes, strategies, decisions, structures and
functions of the Commission, the first ever Gender Mainstreaming Workshop for
Gender Focal Persons was convened from 2 to 5 October, 2019 in Kampala, Uganda,
aimed at sensitizing participants on the importance of gender mainstreaming, and
enhancing their skills and knowledge on gender analysis tools for their effective
application to support gender responsive programmes. The Commission also hosted
a Validation Workshop of the Operational Plan, the Result Framework and the
Regional Harmonization Matrix from 17 to 19 June 2019, with the participation of forty-
five (45) participants from Member States and RECs.

259. In compliance with their obligations under Articles 12 and 13 of the Solemn
Declaration on Gender Equality in Africa (SDGEA), 18 Member States and 3 RECs
have submitted reports on measures taken to implement the Solemn Declaration on
Gender Equality in Africa (SDGEA) in 2019. To address the challenge of low reporting,
the Commission has developed an online reporting tool to facilitate efficient reporting
on the AU gender instruments, including the Solemn Declaration on Gender Equality
in Africa (SDGEA). This platform, will be accessible throughout the continent and
serves as a single point of contact to facilitate both the monitoring and evaluation of
implementation of continental and international commitments on GEWE.

260. Similarly, the Commission continued to advocate for the ratification,
domestication and implementation of AU Instruments on Gender Equality and
Women’s Empowerment. To date, 42 out of 55 Member States have ratified the
Maputo Protocol on Women’s Rights. In 2019, advocacy Missions on the ratification,
domestication and implementation of the Maputo Protocol on Women’s Rights were
conducted in Sudan, Madagascar and Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic. In Sudan
the mission was to support the new government to comply with its regional and
international obligations to promote and protect women’s rights. A capacity building
training for civil society organisations was convened to build and support CSO’s
capacity to advocate and lobby for the ratification of the Maputo Protocol and other
international and regional instruments. 40 women from across Sudan participated.

261. In order to facilitate the full operationalization of PAWO as a Specialized
Agency of the AU in line with Assembly Decision Assembly/AU/Dec.621(XXVIII), a
Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) was signed in February 2019 between the
Commission and the PAWO.

262. The Fund for African Women (FAW) contributes to women’s economic
empowerment by providing financial supports to grassroots organisations. During the
period under review, the Steering Committee of the Fund reviewed 120 proposals
under the 2019 theme of “Women in Decision Making”, out of which 20 were approved
for funding.

          c. Consultations and Commemorations Aiming to Enhance GEWE
             Agenda on the Continent

263.   To mark International Women’s Day on 8 March, 2019, the Commission, in
-----------------------Page 61 End-----------------------

                                                                      EX.CL/1214(XXXVI)
                                                                                Page 59

collaboration with the Ethiopian Ministry of Women, Children and Youth Affairs,
convened 3000 women from around Ethiopia at the AU Headquarters. The
celebrations were attended by H.E the Prime Minister of Ethiopia, Dr. Abiy Ahmed,
under the theme “Think Equal, Build Smart, Innovate for Change towards Durable
Solutions to Forced Displacements in Africa”. Earlier, on the 6th of February, 2019,
the 10th Anniversary of AU Gender Pre-Summit (GPS) was celebrated in Cairo, Egypt
on the margins of the Africa Pre-CSW63 Consultation meeting. The celebration was
attended by around 300 participants including Ministers in charge of Gender and
Women’s affairs, dignitaries of the Host country, Development Partners, UN Agencies,
CSOs, and media (200 women and 100 men (66,6 % women, and 33,4% men). To
enhance cooperation and strengthen partnership between the AU and UN, the two
institutions organised a Senior Women Leaders Meeting in Niamey on the margins of
the AU Summit in July 2019.

H.     CONTINENTAL POLICIES, FRAMEWORKS AND
       STANDARDS
  I. Programme for Infrastructure Development in Africa (PIDA)

264. The Programme for Infrastructure Development in Africa (PIDA) implemented
through a partnership between the Commission, the AUDA-NEPAD, the AfDB and the
UNECA, covers four main sectors including transport, energy, ICT and trans-boundary
water. PIDA’s projects are estimated at $360 billion up to 2040. For its 51 priority action
projects (PAP), the cost estimate stands at $68 billion from 2012 to 2020, or $7.5
billion in expenditure per year.

265. Since its adoption in January 2012, PIDA PAP 1 has produced the following
development impact contributing to the implementation of Agenda 2063:

       i)     A total capacity of approximately 16,066km of highways were built
              throughout the continent;
       ii)    A total capacity of 4,077 km of railways was built through PIDA projects;
       iii)   In the Energy sector, a total transmission line capacity of approximately
              3,506km was added;
       iv)    In the ICT sector, a total of 17 countries are connected with regional fibre
              optic cables;
       v)     Through constructed and operational PIDA projects, 112,900 jobs were
              directly and 49,400 indirectly created.

266. The timeframe of the PIDA PAP is 2012-2020. The Commission is currently
conducting an independent review of the implementation the PIDA Priority Action Plan
(PAP). The analysis will provide the basis and way forward in the formulation of the
second phase of the PIDA programme. The mid-term review of PIDA provides an
opportunity to examine the nexus between PIDA and the AfCFTA as well as the
continent’s industrialisation agenda. The Commission is also working in collaboration
with GIZ to define the corridor approach and the selection criteria. It is, therefore,
expected that PIDA PAP 2 will build upon PIDA PAP 1 but will also be radically different
in the way it addresses pressing needs on the continent including jobs, youth and
-----------------------Page 62 End-----------------------

                                                                    EX.CL/1214(XXXVI)
                                                                              Page 60

women, low access to energy and other basic infrastructure among rural communities.
This means that apart from the usual focus on regional and continental projects, PIDA
will now extend linkage with access infrastructure for rural and remote areas to ensure
relevance with each and every citizen of Africa.

267. Furthermore, as a way to lay a strategic foundation for African infrastructure
development for the next decade, a study that forecasts the current and future
infrastructure needs will be developed, as vital input to the PIDA-PAP 2 project
selection process. The Mid Term Review together with the Market and Demand Study
(MDS) will form a conceptual basis and strategic framework for the development of
the selection criteria for PIDA-PAP 2. The PIDA PAP 2 will be submitted to the
Assembly in January 2021 for its consideration and adoption. Another innovation in
the PIDA PAP 2 process is the involvement of the African Network for Women in
Infrastructure (ANWIn). The PIDA-PAP 2 process aims to be more inclusive in its
project selection approach. In doing this, there is a necessity to account for the needs
of female infrastructure stakeholders (users, policy makers, engineers and service
providers). To achieve this goal, the Commission and AUDA-NEPAD established the
African Women for Infrastructure Network (ANWIN) with a view to promoting women’s
participation in Infrastructure development and access at the national, regional and
global levels.

268.   In 2019, the following advocacy activities were carried out by the Commission:

          i) Organization of the second policy dialogue conference from 24 to 26
              September 2019 in Addis Ababa for the facilitation of the implementation
              of PIDA aimed at providing a platform for Member States to create
              synergies between the different implementing institutions and other
              stakeholders at regional and continental levels;
          ii) Organization, in collaboration with the Government of the Arab Republic
              of Egypt, the AUDA-NEPA and the AfDB of the 2019 PIDA Week from 25
              to 29 November 2019 in Cairo, Egypt, under the theme “Positioning Africa
              to deliver on Agenda 2063 through multi-sectoral approaches to
              infrastructure development”;
          iii) Organization of the fourth PIDA Journalists workshop in Brazzaville,
               Republic of Congo, from 3 to 5 September 2019 which the participation
               of 30 journalists from the continent who shared experiences and
               strategies to market and report on the PIDA projects in the spirit of the
               AU’s Agenda 2063.

269. Also in 2019, the Commission and AUDA-NEPAD developed the PIDA Job
Creation Toolkit to estimate labour market effects of infrastructure projects and
disaggregates the jobs by country, years, sector and professional group.

  II. Continental Transport Policy

           a. Maritime transport

270. After nine (9) years following the adoption of the Revised African Maritime
Transport Charter in Kampala, Uganda in July 2010, only 10 countries namely: Benin,
Burkina Faso, Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Gabon, Kenya, Mauritius, South Africa
-----------------------Page 63 End-----------------------

                                                                       EX.CL/1214(XXXVI)
                                                                                 Page 61

Togo and Gambia have ratified the Charter and deposited their instruments of
ratification with the Commission.

271. The 2nd STC on Transport, Transcontinental and Interregional Infrastructure,
Energy and Tourism (STC-TTIIET) met in Cairo, Egypt, from 14 to 17 April 2019. It
recommended to the Commission to integrate the maritime sector in the development
of the next phase of PIDA. Furthermore, the PIDA Policy Dialogue which was held in
Malabo, from 24 to 26 September 2019, identified the importance of the maritime
transport sector as a key component for PIDA-PAP 2 integrated corridor approach.

           b. Road Transport

272. In this sector, the Commission pursued its efforts in collaboration with key
partners, notably the World Bank, EU and UNECA in the formulation of the Inter-
Governmental Agreement on road standards norms for Trans-African Highways
(TAH), including follow up actions on the Inter-Governmental Agreement on road
standards norms for Trans-African Highways, adopted by the Assembly in June 2014,
organization of regional dissemination and capacity building workshops, covering
three regions (West, North and East) in 2016 and 2017. The remaining regions will
be covered later.

273. The Commission continues to follow up of the African Road Safety Charter and
the African Road Safety Charter, through formulation, monitoring and review of the
African Action Plan for the Global (UN) 2010-2020 Decade of Action for Road Safety.
The Formulation of the Strategic Directions for the post 2020 Decade of Action for
Road Safety and the Draft Action Plan for the Decade 2021-2030 are ongoing.

274. The Commission, in the same vain, organized the 4th African Road Safety
Conference from 30 October to 2 November 2019 and facilitated an African Ministers
roundtable during the Global ministerial conference on Road safety, in February 2019
in Stockholm, Sweden to share the African perspective on this theme.


  III. Geothermal Energy Development in Africa

           a. Geothermal Energy

275. It will be recalled that the Geothermal Risk Mitigation Facility (GRMF) was
established in 2012, under the cooperation with Germany and EU as a financial tool
for supporting the geothermal energy development in Eastern Africa. The GRMF is
hosted and managed by the Commission, capitalized with an initial amount of 50
Million Euro (the EU-Africa ITF: 30 Million and BMZ: 20 Million). In addition to the initial
funds, DFID contributed 47 Million Pounds in 2014, which has however been reduced
to 39 million BP in 2017. On its part, the Commission is contributing around US$ 0.5
million annually for salary and monitoring of the GRMF operations.

276. So far, GRMF awarded total grants of US$ 117 million to 30 projects qualified
projects with a potential of 2,783 MW through five Application Rounds from 2012 to
2018. The planned investment volume by geothermal developers for the 30 projects
is estimated to USD 9.2 billion. Out of 30 projects: 14 Surface Studies and 16 Drilling
-----------------------Page 64 End-----------------------

                                                                     EX.CL/1214(XXXVI)
                                                                               Page 62

Programmes are located in 6 countries: Ethiopia, Djibouti, Comoros, Kenya, Tanzania
and Uganda. The total amount disbursed to developers is about USD 6 million out of
USD 117 million awarded in the five (5) Application Rounds already completed. The
main reasons for the low disbursement rate are the following: (i) Financial: Difficulty
for developers to mobilize their financial contribution as per GRMF financial scheme;
(ii) Legal: Difficulties to secure geothermal resource licensing and closing of Power
Purchasing Agreements (PPAs) and lack of regulatory framework; (iii) Technical: Lack
of adequate geothermal capacity in the region with the consequence of extra costs for
the purchase of equipment; and difficulty of finding human capital in this specialized
industry.

277.   Ongoing actions and outcomes include the following:

   i) Regular consultation with the Ministry of Water Irrigation and Energy as well as
        the Ethiopian Energy Authority led to an effective ratification of the geothermal
        regulation which gives legal and institutional framework to attract private
        investors in geothermal resources in Ethiopia and fast track the implementation
        of projects;
   ii) Several consultative meeting with the public developer Geothermal
        Development Company and monitoring visits in Kenya allowed two projects to
        reach the drilling phase, a step closer to power generation, compared to 1
        project since 2012, the implementation date of GRMF;
   iii) 90% of pending issues preceding the signing of 5 GRMF Grant Contracts
        totalizing $15,370,590 in Ethiopia, Kenya, and Tanzania have been cleared;
   iv) $1,097,877 have been disbursed to surface studies and drilling programmes in
        Comoros, Djibouti, Ethiopia and Kenya;
   v) 2 Oversight Committees organized to discuss and address the main challenges
        and ensure the effective operations of GRMF programme;
   vi) The Early Market Engagement through an online survey to gather geothermal
        projects developers’ feedback Market was carried out between 14 February
        and 6 March 2019. The outcomes showed an increasing interest of developers
        in GRMF grants. The 6th Application Round will be launched in 2020 to provide
        additional grants.

  IV. Electricity Standards

          a. Harmonization of Regulatory Frameworks for Electricity Market in
          Africa

278. The Commission launched the project on “Harmonized Regulatory Framework
for Electricity Market in Africa” in 2015-2016, with the development of a Strategy and
Action Plan. The Strategy and Action Plan were approved by the Specialized
Technical Committee of Ministers for Transport, Trans-continental and Inter-regional
Infrastructure, Energy and Tourism (STC-TTIIET) in Lomé, Togo, in March 2017, and
by the Executive Council in July 2017. Subsequent phases of the project from 2017
have focused on implementation of the Strategy and Action Plan. In light of the above,
the Commission is engaged in the following actions as planned:

       i) A continental transmission system tariff methodology and computation
          model, policy and technical models of mini-grids; and Guidelines for
-----------------------Page 65 End-----------------------

                                                                   EX.CL/1214(XXXVI)
                                                                             Page 63

           Minimum Energy Performance Standards (MEPS) and Energy Labelling
           were developed and adopted by the STC-TTIIET in April 2019;
      ii) Capacity building for power pools, regulators and transmission system
           operators is ongoing to develop capacity required to operate and regulate
           regional electricity power markets;
      iii) Support national and regional institutions to develop required capacity and
           align their systems to the continental transmission tariff methodology;
      iv) Launch the Single Africa Electricity Market at 2021 January Summit.

  V. Africa Renewable Energy Initiative (AREI)

          a. Operationalization of Africa Renewable Energy Initiative (AREI)

279. The African Renewable Energy Initiative (AREI) was launched by the African
Ministerial Conference on the Environment (AMCEN) at the June 2015 Summit and
the COP 21 in Paris in December 2015, to facilitate the development of 10 GW new
capacity of renewable energy sources installed by 2020 and 300 GW by 2030. The
AREI Board of Directors - consisting of five Heads of State and Government
representing the five AU regions - provisionally approved for attribution 24 investment
programmes and projects with an expected total production capacity of 1.7GW for a
total of €4 billion of already planned investments.

280. These investments were prepared with the support of several technical and
financial partners, notably the European Union, the French Development Agency
(AFD), the KfW Group, the European Investment Bank (EIB), and the African
Development Bank (AfDB). Most of these projects are currently undergoing the tender
process. The AREI Board of Directors met three times in 2019 at AU 2019 January
Summit on 10 February 2019 in Addis Ababa, at AU July Summit in Niger and on the
margins of the UN General Assembly on 23 September 2019 in New York and agreed
on 78 projects with a total capacity of 9.9 GW, representing the AREI 2020 targets.

          b. Bioenergy development in Africa

281. The African Bioenergy Framework and Policy Guidelines were adopted by the
Executive Council in January 2013. The following actions are ongoing:

   i) The STC-TTIIET adopted the regional bioenergy strategies and investment
        plans for the Central and eastern Africa regions at its meeting held in Cairo,
        Egypt, in April 2019;
   ii) The Commission is supporting the EAC and ECCAS to mainstream the regional
        bioenergy strategies and investment plans through their respective policy
        organs;
   iii) The bioenergy strategy and investment plan for West Africa region is underway
        while consultations for Southern Africa region have been held and the Terms
        of Reference developed;
   iv) Need to allocate resources to develop regional bioenergy strategies and
        investment plans for the Southern and Northern Africa regions;
   v) Need to allocate resources to design a project preparation facility for bioenergy
        projects as directed by the STC-TTIIET.

                                                                   EX.CL/1214(XXXVI)
                                                                             Page 64

          c. Small Hydropower and Solar Energy Development

282. Recognizing the huge potential of Hydropower and solar energy for Africa and
their ability to contribute to energy access at low cost with high impact, the
Commission designed in 2018, a program for small hydropower and solar energy
development. The STC-TTIIET, at its meeting in April 2019, acknowledged the
importance of this programme and called upon the Commission and AREI to
implement it. The implementation of the program has commenced with resource
assessment of small hydropower potential and development of solar energy policy
framework. Procurement of consultancy services to carry out these assignments was
initiated. However, the exercise is yet to start due to budgetary constraints. As a way
forward, there is need to mobilize resources to implement the small hydropower and
solar energy programmes in order to increase energy access through clean, low
carbon pathway and contribute to inclusive and sustainable development.

283. In 2019, a workshop was conducted in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, of
integrated approach to development through interaction of multi sector and multi
stakeholder engagement for analysing challenges and opportunities of energy
security; and jointly designing phased approach solutions. This should harness solar
energy to improve accessibility, increase productive capacity and socio economic
transformational.


          d. Development of sustainable energy in small island developing
          states (SIDS) in Africa

284. African island states have unique concerns in addressing energy issues
because of their location and their over dependency on fossil fuels, for the majority
spending 30% of their foreign exchange earnings annually on importing fossil fuels.
The Commission developed the concept for a programme on “Renewable Energy in
African Island States (REAIS)” that was validated by the African Island States as were
the Terms of reference for implementing the programme. The STC-TTIIET, at its
meeting in April 2019, called on the Commission and AREI to implement it, including
designing a facility to support African Island States to access financing for renewable
energy projects from climate financing and other financing sources. In this regard, the
following actions are envisaged:

   i) Procurement of consultancy services to carry out these assignments was
       initiated. However, the exercise is yet to start due to budgetary constraints;
   ii) Mobilization of resources to implement the small islands programmes in order
       to support them to shift from fossil fuels based energy resources to renewable
       energy resources.

          e. Gender Mainstreaming in Energy and Modernizing Cooking
          Technologies in Africa

285. The Commission is committed to developing guidelines and policies that fast-
track access to clean energy for all people in Africa, especially women and girls, who
are disproportionately impacted by lack of access because of their socially determined
gender roles. It recognizes women as not only main beneficiaries of energy access,
-----------------------Page 67 End-----------------------

                                                                      EX.CL/1214(XXXVI)
                                                                                Page 65

but also as agents of change, and therefore seeks to strengthen their prospects to
properly participate in the energy sector at all levels. This is expected to contribute to
the realization of Aspiration 6 of Agenda 2063, and the “AU Strategy for Gender
Equality and Women’s Empowerment” launched on the margins of the February 2019
Summit. The aim is to develop a Harmonized Policy for Gender and Energy in Africa,
with the aim to design a Programme for Mainstreaming Gender in Energy.

           f. Establishment of Africa-China Energy Corporation Centre

286. At the Beijing Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) in
September 2018, the National Energy Administration (NEA) and the Commission
signed the Memorandum of Understanding on Strengthening Cooperation in Energy.
The two sides agreed to establish the China-Africa Energy Cooperation Centre
(CAECC). As a follow-up, a joint Secretariat from the two sides will conduct a study
towards the establishment the CAECC during 2019.

    VI. Comprehensive ICT Strategy for Africa (CISA)

           a. Project on Policy and Regulation Initiative On Digital Africa (PRIDA)


      Harmonization of measurable ICT/Telecommunications policy, legal and
       regulatory frameworks
287. The Commission organized a Continental Consultative Meeting on
Harmonization of ICT Policy and Regulations from 2 to 6 September 2019, with the
participation of more than One Hundred Forty (140) participants, including Experts and
Senior Government Officials from over fifty (50) Member States. It developed a Draft
methodology for Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E). Member States selected a number
of priority areas to be addressed by PRIDA project, with a two years’ roadmap. To
facilitate coordination of initiatives and monitoring of ICT policies and regulations in
Africa, the Commission started the design of PRIDA Digital Platform to serve as space
for exchanging best practices, building Africa common positions and accessing to
online trainings and updates on digital policies.

    African stakeholders’ active participation on the global Internet
     governance (IG) debate
288. In an effort to build the capacity of African Experts and policy makers on Internet
Governance (IG) and emerging digital policy issues, the Commission organized the
Annual African School on Internet Governance from 5 to 9 September 2019 in
N’Djamena, Chad, which was followed by the Annual African Internet Governance
Forum in the same city from 10 to 12 September. Furthermore, within the framework
of implementing PRIDA, a training for trainers took place in Addis Ababa from 27 to
31 May 2019.

           b. Digital Transformation Strategy for Africa (DTS)

289. In 2019, the Commission engaged in the development of a comprehensive
Digital Transformation Strategy (DTS) to serve as a blueprint and master plan for
transforming Africa economy and society and adapt them to the reality of the digital
era. The DTS for Africa builds on Agenda 2063 vision. It is conceived to be people-
-----------------------Page 68 End-----------------------

                                                                      EX.CL/1214(XXXVI)
                                                                                Page 66

centred, inclusive, comprehensive and development-oriented for a strong and
sustainable African digital economy. It aims to promote the adoption of digital
technologies and innovation to generate economic growth, enhance job creation,
contribute to poverty eradication and address equality in access to information within
African countries.

           c. AU-EU Digital Economy Task Force (DTF)

290. In an effort to build Africa digital ecosystem, a High-Level Digital Economy Task
Force (DTF) between the African Union and European Union was launched in
December 2018. The two sides are working towards the implementation of this
initiative, through the involvement of a broad variety of actors from public institutions,
private firms, International Financial Institutions, Development Agencies of Member
States, and civil society coming from both continents.

     IMT 2020/ 5G Plan for Africa
291. The Commission, in collaboration with African Telecommunication Union
(ATU), initiated consultations on 5G/IMT 2020 plan and approach for Africa. The
African experts highlighted the potential of 5G networks to enable long-term digital
transformation and emphasized on the capacity, speed and reliable connections. They
emphasized that 5G networks can be crucial in the realization of the Agenda 2063
aspirations by making progress in key sectors such as healthcare and education. The
Commission is preparing to lead the process of developing 5G strategy for Africa.

  VII. African Tourism Strategic Framework
292. The Commission was requested to elaborate a continental tourism policy and
harmonized standards as well as a strategy for ensuring that all the key elements and
targets of the Agenda 2063 are accomplished, and the objectives realized.
Furthermore, the need to strengthen the tourism function within the Commission and
to establish a continental tourism organization which would coordinate tourism
activities in Africa were underscored. The Commission, in collaboration with the
relevant unit of UNECA, formulated the African Tourism Strategic Framework (ATSF)
in line with the goal and strategies proposed within the framework of the Agenda 2063.
The two organizations also prepared a proposal and draft statutes of the envisaged
African Tourism Organization.

293. The Commission from 21 to 23 March 2019 convened a continental workshop
to consider and validate the ATSF, which has since been presented and adopted by
the Second Meeting of the STC-TTIIET held in Cairo, Egypt, from 14 to 18 April 2019.

294. The Commission urges Member States, RECs and stakeholders operating in
the tourism sector to support the establishment of the African Tourism Organization,
which will enhance the exchange of accurate and timely information. The Organization
will promote sustainable tourism in Africa. It is therefore necessary for Member States
to address the finance and investment issues and challenges at both the tourism
industry and the government levels.

  VIII. Harmonization of Statistics in Africa: setting up statistical
  institutions and implementation of SHaSA II
-----------------------Page 69 End-----------------------

                                                                     EX.CL/1214(XXXVI)
                                                                               Page 67


295. During the period under review, the Commission continued to work towards the
establishment of African statistical institutions and implementation of the Strategy for
the Harmonization of Statistics in Africa (SHaSA II), and has made tremendous
progress in the area of statistics. The 2nd Edition of Labour Migration Statistics Report
in Africa and the 2019 Edition of SDG/Agenda 2063 Report in Africa were developed
and published. Technical assistance was also provided to Member States and RECs
for the implementation of 2008 System of National Account; improvement of Labour
Statistics; and the development of Regional and National Strategies for the
development of statistics (RSDS and NSDS) in line with the Second Strategy for the
Harmonization of Statistics in Africa (SHaSA 2). Annual meetings were also organized
for Specialized Technical Group, namely on Governance, Peace and Security
Statistics (STG-GPS) of SHaSA 2 and on External Sector (STG-ES) of SHaSA 2,
followed by the 5th Conference of the African Ministers Responsible for Civil
Registration and Vital Statistics (CRVS).

296. Regarding the African Union Institute for Statistics (STATAFRIC) in Tunis, it is
now in full operation following the adoption of its structure during the July 2019
Summit. The 13th Session of the Committee of the Directors Generals of National
Statistics Office was convened from 18 to 21 November 2019, Tunis, while the Official
Launch of (STATAFRIC) took place on 18 November 2019. Meanwhile, negotiation
have also taken place with Statistics Norway to support the activities of the Institute.

     IX. Training on the African Multi-Dimensional Index
297. Despite the efforts being made by Member States and RECs on regional and
continental integration in Africa, progress is still slow and much remains to be done.
In that regard and in line with the recommendation of the 6th Conference of African
Ministers responsible for integration into Africa, in May 2013, to develop an index that
would assess progress and achievements made by Member States and RECs in
integration, a series of Experts’ consultative meetings between the Commission,
RECs, NSOs and Central Banks were organized.

298. During the meetings dimensions and indicators of the African Multidimensional
Regional Integration Index (AMRII) were defined, discussed and finalized. In 2019,
AMRII was presented to the STC on Finance, Monetary Affairs, Economic Planning
and Integration held from 7 to 8 March 2019, in Yaoundé, Cameroon. The STC
recommended that the AMRII should be presented to Member States. In this respect,
in August and November 2019, the Commission organized the first and second
regional meetings to train Member States on the use of the AMRII, in Lusaka, Zambia,
and Arusha, Tanzania, respectively. Other trainings will be organized in 2020.

I.      GOVERNANCE HUMAN RIGHTS AND INSTITUTIONS
299. In the area of human rights and governance, the Commission carried out a
number of activities in the following specific fields:

     I. Elections
-----------------------Page 70 End-----------------------

                                                                      EX.CL/1214(XXXVI)
                                                                                Page 68

300. During the period under review, the Commission deployed missions to observe
15 elections that were held in Africa, in 2019, in the form of pre-electoral evaluation or
long and short-term observation missions. The missions worked closely with national
election management bodies and political parties. It was noted that the elections were
generally conducted in an overall peaceful environment. In that context, the
Commission provides assistance to Member States to improve electoral processes
and promote the democratic culture.

  II. Constitutionalism and the Rule of Law
301. The Commission carried out a study, including guidelines on constitutionalism,
with the objective of complementing the African Charter on Democracy, Elections and
Governance, by laying down the modalities for possible amendments of national
constitutions, as part of the implementation of the decision adopted by the PSC at its
432nd meeting, on the elaboration of a unified strategy to combat unconstitutional
changes of government in Africa. The study is currently being presented to the policy
organs for consideration.

           a. Access to Justice and Promotion of the AU’s Shared Values

302. The study on the inclusion of the African Charter on Democracy, Elections and
Governance (ACDEG) in school curricula was finalised. Its conclusions will serve as
the basis for the elaboration of a long-term strategy for the promotion of legal
instruments for AU shared values, through educational institutions, with a view to
entrenching the culture of democracy, good governance and respect for the rule of law
and human rights in the popular culture of present and future generations. In that
context, the Commission organised training courses in the Central and East African
regions on the principles of the rule of law, taking into account the dialogues carried
out by parliamentarians, members of the judiciary and policy-makers, in 2015 and
2016.

           b. Preventive Diplomacy and Constitutionalism

303. The High-Level Group on the theme «Democratic Governance and Preventive
Diplomacy in Africa» produced a proactive analysis of the challenges that are
obstacles to the implementation of the mandate of the Commission in the area of
preventive diplomacy. In the same vein, and within the framework of the Joint
Programme of the Commission and the International Institute for Democracy and
Electoral Assistance (IDEA), a mission was deployed to Burkina Faso, from 13 to 18
October 2019. The overall objective of the mission was to enable the Commission and
IDEA to explore opportunities for potential collaboration, together with the competent
authorities and institutions of Burkina Faso and the G5 Sahel. One of the outcomes of
the mission was the drafting of a national as well as a regional project aimed at
providing technical support to institutions, in order to strengthen their resilience to the
general challenge of security in the G5 Sahel region.

           c. Participatory Government and Local Governance

304. The main activities carried out by the Commission in this area focused, inter
alia, on the following aspects:
-----------------------Page 71 End-----------------------

                                                                   EX.CL/1214(XXXVI)
                                                                             Page 69


      i) Celebration of days: 7th African Public Service Day, in Nairobi, Kenya,
           from 21 to 23 June 2019, on the theme “The Intersection of Youth
           Empowerment and Migration”; African Day of Decentralization and Local
           Development (ADDLD), on the theme “The Promotion and Effective
           Implementation of Local Economic Development as a Sustainable Solution
           for Regional and Local Communities to Forced Migration in Africa”;
      ii) Organisation of seminars on: Building the Capacities of States Parties to the
           African Charter on ways to deploy the Guiding Principles for Reporting on
           the Integration and Implementation of the Charter; Public Service
           Productivity in Africa; Advocacy for the Promotion of the Signing and
           Ratification of the African Charter on the Values and Principles of
           Decentralisation, Local Governance and Local Development;
      iii) Organisation of workshops on: Capacity Building for Implementation,
           Monitoring and Reporting on the New Urban Agenda and SDG 11 in
           Southern Africa and West Africa.

  III. The Fight against Corruption
305. The main mandate of the African Union Advisory Board on Corruption (AUABC)
is to promote and encourage the adoption of measures and actions by State Parties
to prevent, detect, punish and eradicate corruption and related offences in Africa as
well as to follow-up on the application of those measures and submit a report to the
Executive Council on a regular basis on the progress made by each State Party in
complying with the provisions of the Convention.

306. To date, forty-two (42) countries have ratified the AU Convention on Preventing
and Combating Corruption and are State Parties to it. During 2019, only two Member
States ratified the Convention, namely Mauritius, and Sao Tomé and Principe.

307. In 2019, the Board focused on the implementation of the recommendations
emanating from the African Anti-Corruption Year commemorated in 2018 which
provided space for strong collaboration of Member States, AU Organs, the various
departments of the Commission, the African Governance Architecture, the Civil
Society, Development partners and other international organizations, in raising
awareness and amplifying the efforts being undertaken in combating corruption on the
African continent.

308. As part of the implementation of the recommendations of the Nouakchott
Declaration of July 2018, the Board dedicated the topic of Asset recovery in both the
celebration of the African Anti-Corruption Day on 11 July and the 3rd Edition of the
African Anti-Corruption Dialogue held in Kigali, Rwanda from 9 to 11 October 2019.
Further, as a precursor to the 3rd African Anti-Corruption Dialogue, the Board
conducted a survey to assess the state of anti-corruption efforts in Africa with a
particular focus on asset recovery. The results of the survey which have highlighted
the complexities, the nature, trends and challenges of asset recovery in Africa will
inform the development of the Common African Position on Asset Recovery. The
Board implemented key planned activities which included review missions; finalization
of studies on the state of implementation of the AUCPCC and the review of best
practices in fighting corruption within the Member States; review of the state party
-----------------------Page 72 End-----------------------

                                                                      EX.CL/1214(XXXVI)
                                                                                Page 70

reporting tool; the celebration of the African Anti-Corruption Day on 11th July and; peer
to peer review. The Board also convened three ordinary sessions and one
extraordinary session. The sessions facilitated the provision of strategic direction in
the implementation of the activities of the Board in realizing the objectives of its
Strategic Plan (2018-2022).

309. The review missions conducted were to Congo, Tanzania and Madagascar.
The review missions were conducted to assess and evaluate the States Parties
compliance with the Convention. The review missions enabled also the Board to
engage first hand contacts with National Anti-Corruption Agencies, high governmental
offices, the private sector, civil society, the media and academia on implementation
trends, challenges and country specific best practises in fulfilling the provisions of the
Convention. Furthermore, the Board successfully concluded on the country review
reports on Namibia and Uganda. The key findings of the reviews revealed good will
and commitment by the State Parties to fight corruption through enactment of
appropriate legal frameworks and mechanisms as well as institutional structures. The
reviews also enabled the identification of good practices as well as challenges being
faced by the state party. The Board made recommendations and various courses of
actions to be taken by the reviewed countries in order to accelerate the fight against
corruption.

310. The Board held its first Retreat with members of the Permanent
Representatives Committee, which enabled the identification of challenges and
opportunities impacting the Board. The retreat provided a platform for deepened
dialogue between the PRC and the Board and enhancing the working methods
between the two AU Organs. The Retreat agreed on several outcomes key among
them:

       i) The Board to increase its outreach and stakeholder engagement through
            smart collaboration, partnerships and communication;
       ii) The delivery enhancement on the Board’s Mandate through implementation
            of strategic interventions, recommendations and provision of pertinent
            support to Member States on various thematic areas on combatting
            corruption;
       iii) Encouragement to the Board to prioritize research, learning and knowledge
            management as a means to build capacity of stakeholders in combating
            corruption; and
       iv) The Board to enhance its institutional development through strategic
            management by being effective and efficient and result-oriented.

311. The Board collaborated with several stakeholders, namely: GIZ on Access and
Integrity – Approaches to a Strong Rule of Law; the Organisation Internationale de la
Francophonie (OIF) on the prevention and fight against corruption and human rights;
UNDOC on asset recovery; the Commonwealth and the Independent Commission
Against Corruption of Hong Kong and many other key stakeholders. All these
interactions presented opportunities for the Board to contribute perspectives on new
approaches to combatting corruption. The meetings further availed opportunity for the
Board to raise awareness on its mandate and continental priorities in the fight against
corruption.
-----------------------Page 73 End-----------------------

                                                                     EX.CL/1214(XXXVI)
                                                                               Page 71

312. The Board participated in the First Anti-Corruption Forum and African
Association of Anti-Corruption Agencies Annual General Meeting held from 12 to 15
June 2019, in Sham el Sheik, Egypt. The events allowed the Board to raise awareness
on its mandate and solicit support from National Anti-Corruption Agencies and other
stakeholders for continental priorities in the fight against corruption. The major
challenges faced by the African Union Advisory Board on Corruption in delivering on
its mandate, include the non-response by Member States to host country review
missions and advocacy missions, in addition to the structural and financial issues to
be addressed within the institutional and restructuring reforms of the Union. The Board
will continue to put more efforts on finalizing the work on the development of the
Common African Position on Asset Recovery as well as finalizing the development of
the Africa Anti-Corruption Methodology. As various stakeholders continue to reach out
to the Board for partnerships and collaboration, the Board will reposition itself through
development of long term continental programmes which are inclusive and define the
priority for Africa in the promotion of the fight against corruption.

    IV. Human Rights and Transitional Justice

     Human Rights

313. The Commission, in close collaboration with the main African human rights
institutions, developed an Action Plan for the Human and Peoples’ Rights Decade in
Africa, with a view to strengthening the human and peoples’ rights system in Africa.
The objective is to reinforce the human and peoples’ rights system in Africa, while
urging Member States to ratify and domesticate human rights instrument for effective
implementation.

314. One of the noteworthy advancements was the adoption by the AU in February
2019, of a general policy framework for transitional justice, within which each State
can elaborate an appropriate policy for the national context, geared toward promoting
peace, healing past wounds, and respecting human and peoples’ rights. The
Commission initiated a series of actions, through the deployment of experts and the
organisation of workshops, in support of various Truth, Justice, Reconciliation and
Reparations Commissions, particularly in the West and East African Regions, more
specifically in South Sudan. The sensitisation actions also involved business
communities, with a regional roadmap prepared for businesses, within the context of
implementation of the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human
Rights.

315. In addition, the Commission provided technical assistance to Member States
and national human rights institutions by organising forums that enabled national
human rights institutions to interact with members of the PRC on issues relating to
displaced persons, refugees and returnees. The forums were aimed at mobilising
national institutions to contribute to curbing displacements resulting from a range of
causes such as human rights violations, post-electoral violence, intolerance, sexual
and gender-based violence, violent extremism, impunity, terrorism, poor use of natural
resources, and corruption.

316. The project to establish a Pan-African Human Rights Institute, pursuant to the
AU Assembly Declaration on the Human and Peoples’ Rights Decade in Africa,
-----------------------Page 74 End-----------------------

                                                                   EX.CL/1214(XXXVI)
                                                                             Page 72

adopted in Kigali, Rwanda, in July 2016, is well underway. In this regard, the
Commission has already referred legal issues on the draft statute of the Institute to
the Specialized Technical Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs for consideration.
Furthermore, progress has been made in the project for the construction of a
permanent monument for all categories of victims of human rights violations, along
with a resource centre at the Headquarters of the Union, which was decided on by the
Assembly. The final design of the project has already been approved by the working
group of Member States set up for that purpose. The African Union continues to
commemorate human rights related events, particularly the commemoration of the
genocide against the Tutsis on 7 April, and African Human Rights Day on 21 October,
devoted essentially to internally displaced person and forced displacement. Lastly, the
Commission organised dialogues on human rights with the African Union’s
international partners, particularly the European Union and the United Nations.

    Establishment of the Hybrid Court for South Sudan

317. In accordance with the Communique of the 547th meeting of the Peace and
Security Council and the Agreement on the Resolution of the Conflict in South Sudan
(ARCISS) held in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia 26 September 2015, the Commission, in
collaboration with the Transitional Government of National Unity of the Republic of
South Sudan (TGoNU), has been working towards the establishment of the Hybrid
Court for South Sudan “as an African-led and Africa-owned legal mechanism, to
investigate and prosecute individuals bearing the responsibility for violations of
international law and/or applicable South Sudanese law, committed from 15
December 2013 through the end of the transitional period.”

318. The Commission was encouraged by the signing of the Revitalized Agreement
on the Resolution of the Conflict in the Republic of South Sudan (R-ARCSS) in
September 2018, which has annexed to it, a revised implementation matrix containing,
among others, a set of activities with timelines, geared towards operationalization of
the HCSS. In 2019, the Commission undertook a needs assessment mission to Juba
within the context of Inter-Departmental Task Force led by Peace and Security
Department to identify areas of assistance by the Commission to the implementation
of the R-ARCSS.

319. In view of the above, the Commission plans to execute the following activities
towards the establishment of the HCSS and the overall Transitional Justice Process:

    i) Print the Arabic version of the R-ARCSS;
    ii) Convene High Level Meeting of Experts on Operationalization Hybrid Court for
         South Sudan;
    iii) Working visits to Juba, South Sudan; and
    iv) Consultative meeting with key representatives such as AU High Representative
         for South Sudan, R-JMEC, United Nations Commission for South Sudan and
         United Nations Office of Legal Affairs.

320. The Commission wishes to reiterate its call to the Government of South Sudan
to collaborate in the signing and domestication of the MoU and to provide its support
to the Commission in the overall process of establishing the HCSS in accordance with
the Revitalized Implementation Matrix.

                                                                              Page 73


    V. Implementation of Decisions on the International Criminal Court
    (ICC)

     AU’s request for an advisory opinion from the International Criminal Court

321. During the February 2019 Assembly ordinary session, the Commission
reported on its implementation of its Assembly/AU/Dec.672(XXX) of January 2018 on
the request for an advisory opinion from the International Court of Justice (ICJ) and to
place the issue on the agenda of the 73rd Session of the UN General Assembly
(UNGA). In this regard, the Commission developed the Draft Question and submitted
it to the Open-ended Ministerial Committee on ICC for consideration. On the
recommendations of the latter, the Assembly further requested the Commission to
revisit the Draft Question, taking into account political aspects and submit the final
draft to the Open-ended Committee, having allowed all Member States of the Union,
the opportunity to make inputs to the draft prior to submission to the UNGA for
consideration in May 2019. This assignment was accomplished by the Commission,
in consultation with international legal experts. Subsequently, the Open-ended
Ministerial Committee met on 29 April 2019 in Addis Ababa, to finalize the Draft
Question. However, no Ministers were present and Member States were represented
by designated officials from the Permanent Missions to the AU. In this regard, the
representatives of Member States present, decided that the Meeting could not validly
take place without the presence of at least one (1) Minister, to take ownership of the
outcomes of the meeting and therefore decided to convene the Ministerial Meeting on
the margins of the Executive Council Session held in July 2019 in Niamey, Niger.

322. In light of the postponement of the consideration of the Draft Question, the
Commission was requested to postpone consideration of the Draft Resolution by the
UNGA, pending the outcome of the meeting of the Open-ended Committee, which was
held on 5 July 2019. However, there were still concerns with the low attendance of
Ministers at the meeting as well as States’ non-responsiveness to the Commission’s
request for inputs to the Draft Question. Only Egypt had provided inputs.

323. In this regard, they deferred consideration of the Draft Question and any
decision on the matter to the next meeting of the Ministerial Committee, to be held on
the sidelines of the UNGA. At the meeting of the Open-ended Committee held on 23
September 2019 in New York, USA, the Committee, once again, failed to secure the
attendance of a single Minister and only seven (7) Member States were in attendance.

324. In order to better prepare for the seizure of the ICJ, several Member States
expressed a need for the Commission to conduct an in-depth study into the case law
of the ICJ in order to better predict the outcome of any advisory opinion. Nevertheless,
the Working Group recommended that the next meeting of the Open-ended
Committee should discuss the way forward and report to the Assembly for a decision
on the way forward – either to continue pursuing the request for the advisory opinion
or to postpone or even cancel the process, considering that the international
community is looking to the AU for a decision on the process.

     AU’s Amici Curiae Submission before the Appeals Chamber of the ICC
-----------------------Page 76 End-----------------------

                                                                   EX.CL/1214(XXXVI)
                                                                             Page 74

325. In July and September 2018, the Commission, represented by the Office of the
Legal Counsel, made its written and Oral Amicus Curiae Submissions, respectively,
in the Appeal Case of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan against the decision of the
ICC Pre-trial Chamber II for Jordan’s non-compliance with the request of the Court to
arrest and surrender former President Omar al-Bashir of The Sudan. The AU’s
Submissions focused on reiterating its long-standing position that there are no
exceptions to the fundamental rule of international law on the immunity of Heads of
State and requested the Appeals Chamber to hold in its decision, that the UN Security
Council Resolution 1593 does not waive the immunity of President Al-Bashir.

326. On 6 June 2019, the ICC Appeals Chamber adopted a decision stating that
immunities of Heads of State and Government do not have a stance before the ICC.
Based on this, the Court found Jordan in violation of its obligations under the Rome
Statute for failing to arrest the then President Al Bashir when he was attending the
Summit of the League of Arab States in Jordan. The implication of the Appeals
Chamber’s judgment is that future appeals by States on grounds of immunities would
not stand before the Court.

  VI. Implementation of AU Decision on the Decolonisation of
  Chagos Archipelago
327. Pursuant to Assembly Decision of February 2019 requesting the Chairperson
of the Commission, to maintain the efforts to follow up on the ICJ Advisory Opinion on
the ‘Legal Consequences of the Separation of the Chagos Archipelago from Mauritius
in 1965’ and to report on the results of these efforts in the next Assembly Session in
February 2020, the Commission is following up with the Embassy of Mauritius
regarding the implementation of ICJ Advisory Opinion by Britain.

328. On 22nd May 2019, the UN General Assembly voted in support of a motion
setting a six-month deadline for Britain for the withdrawal of the British colonial
administration from the Chagos islands and for the islands to be reunified with
Mauritius. UNGA also voted to endorse an advisory opinion issued by the ICJ on 25
February, 2019, calling on the UK to relinquish its hold on the territory in order to
complete the process of decolonization. The Deadline was set by the UNGA as 22
November 2019. However, UK is still holding its administration on the Chagos islands.
In this regard, the Commission is consulting with the Embassy of Mauritius to publish
a communique addressing the continued unlawful colonial administration of Britain on
the Chagos Islands. It should also be noted that the Commission was confronted with
the challenge of lack of adequate resources in carrying out this important task, issue
that should be taken into account in the future.

  VII. Humanitarian Issues
329. Under the patronage of H.E. Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, President of
Equatorial Guinea and Champion of the theme for 2019: “Year of Refugees, Returnees
and Internally Displaced Persons: Towards Durable Solutions to Forced Displacement
in Africa”, the Commission carried out key activities, including the celebration of the
50th Anniversary of the 1969 Convention on Refugees, and the 10th Anniversary of
the Kampala Convention, in the presence of an important gathering of high authorities
of the AU and UN Specialised Agencies, as well as a cross-section of refugees. As
-----------------------Page 77 End-----------------------

                                                                      EX.CL/1214(XXXVI)
                                                                                Page 75

part of this dual commemoration, the Commission organised a visit to the Tsoré
Refugee Camp in Ethiopia, during which the Champion of the theme of the year
announced a fifty thousand US dollars donation for the construction of a school in the
Camp. President Obiang also offered to host refugees in his country, within the
framework of a resettlement plan.

330. The complexity of the refugee issue calls for the enhancement of
multilateralism, in order to address the main causes of all forms of forced
displacement. The African Union and its Member States, as well as the RECs, should
continue to be at the centre of such multilateralism, in order to deepen reflection on
the root causes of this phenomenon, and solidarity actions in the context of institutional
frameworks, such as Comprehensive Refugee Response Framework (CRRF). The
efforts resulted in innovative policies and approaches for dealing with refugees in
many countries, namely Uganda, Ethiopia, Djibouti, Kenya and Rwanda. Niger has
been hosting refugees for decades, however it is also making impressive efforts to
save lives through its emergency transit mechanism, to facilitate the evacuation of
refugees in Libya. The African Union leads the Joint AU-EU-UN Taskforce for the
protection of migrants and refugees in Libya.

331. The African Union will continue to collaborate with Member States to explore
lasting solutions to the problem of forced displacement in Africa. Such solutions
necessarily entail the search for synergy between good governance, development,
peace and combatting climate change, in a holistic approach that includes women and
youth.      In order to achieve this objective, we will need to enhance the
operationalisation of appropriate legal instruments such as the African Governance
Architecture, and the African Peace and Security Architecture, against the backdrop
of the imminent establishment of the African Humanitarian Agency.

332. In the same context, AMISOM continued to involve communities in the
identification and implementation of quick-impact and peacebuilding projects (PIP) in
Somalia. In this regard, AMISOM carried out several humanitarian support operations
to vulnerable communities. In addition, the Mission organised project management
training courses in order to improve project launch and implementation rates.
However, the humanitarian situation remains fragile in some regions of the country,
due to the lasting effects of climate change, which causes drought, low rainfall, and
many other climate shocks. There are still urgent humanitarian needs due to the
combined effects of armed conflicts and climate change.

J.     ORGANS AND INSTITUTIONS OF THE UNION
     African Commission of Human and People’s Rights (ACHPR)
333. The African Commission of Human and People’s Rights (ACHPR) is the
premier and oldest human rights Organ of the African Union. The ACHPR was
established in accordance with Article 30 of the African Charter on Human and
Peoples’ Rights (the African Charter), which has been ratified by all AU Member
States, with the exception of Morocco.

334. During the period under review, ACHPR has continued to receive and examine
periodic state reports from State Parties on measures taken to implement the
-----------------------Page 78 End-----------------------

                                                                     EX.CL/1214(XXXVI)
                                                                               Page 76

provisions of the African Charter as well as its Protocols and other related Conventions
adopted over the years, notably Protocol on the Rights of Women in Africa (the Maputo
Protocol) and the African Union Convention for the Protection and Assistance of
Internally Displaced Persons in Africa (Kampala Convention). Likewise, ACHPR
received and examined Communications (Complaints) which allege human rights
violations under Chapter III of the African Charter.

335. Among the key activities undertaken during the period, in line with its mandate,
feature:

  i)   The Sessions/Statutory Meetings were:

         i.    The 25th Extraordinary Session of the ACHPR, held from 19 February
               to 05 March 2019, in Banjul, The Gambia;
        ii.    The 64th Ordinary Session of the ACHPR, held from 24 April to 14 May
               2019, in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt; 26th Extraordinary Session of the
               ACHPR, held from 16 to 30 July 2019, in Banjul, The Gambia; and
        iii.   The 65th Ordinary Session of the ACHPR, held from 21 October to 10
               November 2019, in Banjul, The Gambia.

 ii)   Communications: ACHPR received and considered twenty (20)
       Communications, five (5) of which were issued with Provisional Measures. It
       decided not to be seized of one (1) Communication. The number of complaints
       received shows the continuing importance of the quasi-judicial mandate of the
       ACHPR to individuals and groups who could not find remedy locally for
       violations they suffered.

iii)   Review of state reports on implementation of their human rights
       obligations:
       During its 64th and 65th Ordinary Sessions, the ACHPR examined the periodic
       reports of Egypt, Lesotho, The Gambia, Chad, and Zimbabwe. The review of
       these reports allowed the ACHPR to engage constructively with the State
       Parties, and to assess the current state of human rights in those States and
       their level of compliance with the provisions of the African Charter and the
       Maputo Protocol respectively.

iv)    Public sessions – unique platform for direct participation of State Parties,
       national and specialized human rights institutions and civil society
       organizations, in deliberations on the state of human rights. The Public
       Sessions afford State Parties with a common forum for engaging in critical, but
       constructive exchanges on the state of human and peoples’ rights on the
       continent. In this Forum, ACHPR has witnessed an increase in the level of
       participation of State Parties, up to 28 State Parties in the last two sessions of
       ACHPR.

 v)    Responding to emerging human rights issues – Urgent letters of appeal
       and Press statements: Over thirty-five (35) Urgent Letters of Appeal to State
       Parties were sent aimed at intervening in emergency situations and prevent
       irreparable harm being done to alleged victims of human rights violations in the
-----------------------Page 79 End-----------------------

                                                                    EX.CL/1214(XXXVI)
                                                                              Page 77

        States concerned. The ACHPR received about ten (10) responses addressing
        the issues raised in the urgent letters of appeal.

 vi)    Advocacy for ratification of AU Instruments - A Continental Sensitization
        Seminar on the Ratification of the Protocol on the Rights of Older Persons in
        Africa and the Protocol on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in Africa was
        organized from 5 to 6 July 2019, in collaboration with the Government of
        Rwanda. The Seminar raised awareness about the Protocols and the need to
        expedite their ratification and entry into force. Following the Seminar, Benin
        ratified the Protocol on the Rights of Older Persons in Africa on 6 September
        2019; Central African Republic (CAR) and Rwanda signed the Protocol on the
        Rights of Older Persons in Africa on 4 October 2019 and 21 October 2019
        respectively; and Rwanda signed the Protocol on the Rights of Persons with
        Disabilities in Africa on 21 October 2019.

vii)    Addressing emerging human rights issues and mainstreaming human
        rights into the AU policy processes: During the 64th Ordinary Session,
        ACHPR launched the Study on Transitional Justice and Human and Peoples’
        Rights in Africa (TJ Study), which complements the African Union Transitional
        Justice Policy (AUTJP), which was adopted by the AU Assembly in February
        2019. As a follow-up, ACHPR has started engaging the Truth, Reconciliation,
        and Reparations Commission in The Gambia to support the transitional justice
        process in The Gambia. ACHPR also contributed to the process of
        operationalizing the human rights mandate of the AU Peace and Security
        Council (PSC), as reflected in its Communique of its 866th meeting. Further,
        ACHPR provided advice to the Africa Group in Geneva on the ongoing
        negotiation at the UN for a binding instrument on Business and Human Rights.

viii)   Implementation of decisions of the AU Policy Organs: The Second PRC-
        ACHPR Joint Retreat was held from 7 to 8 February 2019, in Addis Ababa,
        Ethiopia, based on the outcomes of the Nairobi Retreat held in June 2018. This
        retreat is expected to be held annually. However, the Second PRC-ACHPR
        Joint Retreat, which was scheduled to take place from 28 to 29 November 2019,
        could not take place due to budgetary constraints.

 ix)    Fact-finding Mission to Libya and Sudan: The Communique of the PSC
        adopted on 6 June 2019, on the situation in The Sudan, and Communique of 5
        July 2019 on the situation in Libya and the plight of African Migrants in Libya,
        requested the Chairperson of the Commission to carry out investigation
        missions to these countries, with the participation of the ACHPR. The Executive
        Council Decision in its Decision EX.CL/Dec.1065(XXXV), also called on the
        ACHPR to undertake a fact-finding mission to investigate allegations of
        violations of the human rights of African migrants in Libya. ACHPR sent a
        correspondence to the Commission regarding the investigation missions and
        awaits further information on the next steps relating to the ACHPR’s
        participation in the missions.
336. Among the challenges facing ACHPR the mismatch in the amount of resources
and the technical capacity that is availed to the ACHPR for executing this mandate
and deliver on this work load. Only half of the approved Secretariat staff (twenty-three
(23) of the forty-six (46)) have been recruited. This has an impact on the effective
-----------------------Page 80 End-----------------------

                                                                      EX.CL/1214(XXXVI)
                                                                                Page 78

delivery of the mandate of the ACHPR. Moreover, while the ACHPR has been in
existence for over 30 years, it has as yet to have its headquarters constructed. Several
decisions of the Executive Council have been adopted to mobilize the necessary funds
construction of the ACHPR Headquarters. The Bureau of the ACHPR has identified
this as a priority area and to that end, held discussions with President Adama Barrow
of the Gambia on 8 November 2019, who assured the ACHPR that the construction of
the headquarters of the ACHPR is a priority of his administration and would work with
the ACHPR for its realization including through mobilizing the required support, among
others, through the AU. ACHPR will follow up actively on this issue.

337. Furthermore, there is lack of compliance by State Parties with requests for
Provisional Measures or Urgent Letters of Appeal, and failure to report on the
measures they have adopted to give effect to the decisions of the ACHPR where they
have been found to be in violation of the provision(s) of the African Charter. During the
reporting period, only one (1) State Party reported. With the establishment and
operationalisation of the PRC Sub-Committee on Democracy, Human Rights and
Governance, it is expected that the Policy Organs will provide the necessary resources
to the Sub-Committee with a view to ensuring effective implementation of
decisions/recommendations of the ACHPR.

338. For next year, the ACHPR plans a number of activities, which includes two
Ordinary Sessions and two Extra-Ordinary Sessions, and the Second PRC –ACHPR
Joint Retreat. Apart from sustaining its responsiveness to emerging human rights
issues on the continent, the ACHPR intends to enhance its engagement with the wider
AU system and State Parties including through, among others, the PRC Sub-
Committee on Democracy, Human Rights and Governance, the AU Special Envoy on
Youth and the Peace and Security Council. The ACHPR further aims to enhance its
visibility and outreach in 2020 by ensuring that the Implementation Plan of its
Communication and Media Strategy is properly implemented.

  African Court on Human and People’s Rights (AfCHPR)
339. As of 31 December, 2019, the Protocol establishing the Court had been ratified
by thirty (30) out of the fifty-five (55) Member States of the African Union, namely:
Algeria, Benin, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cameroon, Chad, Congo, Côte d’Ivoire,
Comoros, Gabon, The Gambia, Ghana, Kenya, Libya, Lesotho, Malawi, Mali,
Mauritania, Mauritius, Mozambique, Niger, Nigeria, Uganda, Rwanda, Sahrawi Arab
Democratic Republic, Senegal, South Africa, Tanzania, Togo and Tunisia. Of the thirty
(30) State Parties to the Protocol, only nine (9), namely: Benin, Burkina Faso, Côte
d’Ivoire, Ghana, Malawi, Mali, Tanzania and Tunisia, have to date, made the
declaration under Article 34(6) thereto, accepting the jurisdiction of the Court to receive
cases from individuals and non-governmental organizations.

340. During the period under review, the Court undertook judicial activities relate to
the receipt and examination of judicial matters, though, inter alia, case management,
organisation of public hearings and delivery of judgments, rulings and orders, with a
total of fifty-four (54) new cases in 2019. The Court also undertook a number of
promotional activities, aimed at raising awareness among stakeholders. These
activities included, sensitization visits and seminars to Djibouti, Comoros and
Zimbabwe; organisation of the 4th African Judicial Dialogue under the aegis of the
-----------------------Page 81 End-----------------------

                                                                     EX.CL/1214(XXXVI)
                                                                               Page 79

African Union, on the theme “Tackling Contemporary Human Rights Issues: The Role
of the Judiciary in Africa,” from 30 October to 1 November 2019, in Kampala, Uganda.

341. Despite the increase in the number of cases received by the Court, there has
been no new ratifications of the Protocol by Member States in 2019. This lack of
progress in ratifications and non-compliance with the judgments undermine the
Court’s ability and mandate to ensure the protection of human rights on the continent.
It is therefore imperative that all Member States of the Union cooperate in the effective
implementation of the judgments and orders of the Court as required by Article 30 of
the Protocol. To ensure independence of the Court, the appointment of the Board of
Trustees of the Legal Aid Fund for AU Human Rights Organs and the eventual
launching of the Fund as decided by various Executive Council decisions, is of critical
importance.

  African Union Commission on International Law (AUCIL)
342. In 2019, AUCIL held its 17th Ordinary Session in Addis Ababa (March-April
2019), under the theme «Constitutional Democracy, Rule of Law and the fight against
corruption ". AUCIL also convened the 8th Forum on International Law, which took
place from 2 to 3 December 2019, in Addis- Ababa. It collected pluralistic contributions
to already existing debates by taking stock of recent dynamics and proposals; and
thereafter, drafting alternatives to move beyond challenges of constitutional
democracy and the rule of law, particularly in the context of fighting corruption. The
Forum provided African experts, researchers and decision-makers with an opportunity
to address and discuss these issues and other related aspects. The publication of the
8th Forum Proceedings in the AUCIL Journal is also expected by the Mid-2020,
thereby fulfilling AUCIL mandate to disseminate international law within and beyond
the continent.

343. AUCIL also undertook various studies related to Human Rights through the
appointed Special Rapporteurs. In particular, it is to be recalled that the study on the
AU Model Law for the implementation of the African Union Convention for the
Protection of, and Assistance to Internally Displaced Persons in Africa (Kampala
Convention) was adopted through an Assembly decision in February 2018. This Model
Law on the Kampala Convention is the first ever AUClL document to be endorsed by
the Member States, and is intended to be used as a resource in the drafting process
of national legislation to implement the Kampala Convention at the national level. As
part activities of the 2019 AU theme, it is important to coordinate with all the relevant
stakeholders to develop sample instruments to be included as supplement to this
Model Law.



  Pan-African Parliament (PAP)
344. PAP, under the leadership of its Fifth Bureau, implemented several activities,
in fulfilment of its mandate to “ensure the full participation of African peoples in the
development and economic integration of the continent.” During the year under
review, PAP organized several activities focused on the promotion of the AU theme
for 2019, development of Model laws, advocacy, CSO and RECs engagement and
climate change, geared toward the achievement of PAP strategic objectives.
-----------------------Page 82 End-----------------------

                                                                      EX.CL/1214(XXXVI)
                                                                                Page 80


345. The Bureau of PAP has continued to utilize every available opportunity to
advocate for more ratifications of the New PAP Protocol (Malabo Protocol). This
Protocol has garnered additional ratifications, taking the total number of ratifications
to twelve (12), namely: Benin, Cameroon, Chad, Equatorial Guinea, The Gambia,
Ghana, Madagascar, Mali, Saharawi Arab Democratic Republic, Sierra Leone,
Somalia, and Togo and 21 signatures. In its resolve to fast-track the ratification of the
PAP Protocol, the Bureau has assigned responsibilities to all Bureau Members, who
will be leading advocacy missions to their respective regions. Through the National
Speakers, the PAP has called for urgent action to sign and/or ratify the Malabo
Protocol.

346. The PAP organized several activities and its main achievements included: i)
The holding of the 10th Annual Speakers’ Conference with the renewed commitment
of Speakers of National Parliaments to take action to push for the ratification of AU
treaties, particularly the PAP Malabo Protocol; and ii) the finalisation of the formulation
of the PAP 2019 - 2023 Strategic Plan, which is was considered in Plenary in October
2019.

347. In line with its core mandate of ensuring an effective participation of the peoples
of African in the economic development and integration of the African continent, PAP
will continue to assert its relevance and proactiveness by considering and debating
the issues that speak directly to the realities of the continent and the peoples of Africa.
In 2020, the Pan-African Parliament is expected once more mainstream in its activities
the African Union theme of the year, which is “Silencing the Guns: Creating Conducive
Conditions for Africa’s Development”.

  African Peer Review Mechanism (APRM)
348. APRM is a mutually agreed instrument voluntarily acceded to by AU Member
States as an African self-monitoring mechanism on governance. In 2018 and 2019,
APRM harmonized its work in governance with the Commission’s departments and
Organs that form the African Governance Platform and was fully integrated into the
Statutory Union budget. APRM was chair of the AGA Platform for 2018-2019 and was
the lead institution in producing the annual Africa Governance Report 2019, submitted
to the AU Assembly in February 2019.

349. In 2019, peer reviews of Mozambique and Cote d'Ivoire were conducted at the
February 2019 APR Forum. These reports candidly highlight commendable practices
and governance challenges which the Heads of State committed to address. During
the course of the year, APRM completed review missions to Egypt and Niger, as well
as: (i) a targeted review mission to Djibouti on decentralization; (ii) two targeted review
missions to Zambia on Tourism and Mineral Resources; and (iii) a targeted review
mission to Namibia on youth unemployment. In 2019, the APRM also launched its
Kenya, Mozambique and Uganda second review reports, and conducted training of
staff at the Uganda National Planning Authority on harmonization of the APRM
National Plan of Action (NPOA) that is attached to the review report, with Uganda’s
National Development Plan. Training included components on monitoring, evaluation
and reporting of recommendations in the APRM NPOA.

                                                                   EX.CL/1214(XXXVI)
                                                                             Page 81

350. APRM is also continually improving its governance tools including exchanging
experiences and lessons with continental governance experts, and this was done at
the Third Annual Methodology Forum convened in April 2019 in Sharm El Sheikh,
Egypt. In fulfilling its expanded mandate for reporting on governance across the
continent, in addition to submitting the Africa Governance Report 2019 to the
Assembly in February 2019, the APRM convened a Voluntary National Reporting
(VNR) on Agenda 2030 meeting for Member States in Marrakech in April 2019 to
follow up on preparations for the UN High Level Political Forum (HLPF) meeting in
July 2019, in partnership with AUC, ECA, UNDESA and the Office of the UN Special
Advisor on Africa. APRM convened a side event at the UN HPLF specifically on SDG
16 on governance and SDG 17 on the means of implementation, in partnership with
the AU Mission in New York, with more than 10 Member States taking part.

351. In 2019, the APRM family grew further, with Botswana joining the APRM as its
38th Member State at the APR Forum on 9 February 2019, and Seychelles and
Zimbabwe are planning to join at the Forum in February 2020, bringing the APRM
family to 40, well on the way towards the goal of universal accession set by the
Assembly for 2023.

352. The APRM review process is affected by long completion times for the country
self-assessment reports, as well as elections. These challenges will be mitigated in
future by the APRM’s program of capacity building of national structures, which will
create durable national governance structures, able to produce quality annual national
governance reports (NGRs) in line with the Assembly decision of February 2019.
National structures will also be able to produce state reports for AU organs and
agencies, including reporting on ACDEG, as agreed with the Commission. The APRM
and AGA Platform will also develop the Africa Governance Report 2021, which will
include a future research perspective in the analysis of governance trends, for
submission to the Assembly in early 2021. As of 31 December 2019, the African Peer
Review Mechanism (APRM) had a membership of 37 Member States. By the end of
the year 2019, the APRM had completed governance reviews of twenty-one (21)
Member States, with reviews of the Sudan (first review) and Uganda (second review)
completed at the APR Forum of Heads of State and Government in January 2018.

    African Institute for Remittances (AIR)
353. The African Institute for Remittances (AIR), a Specialized Technical Office of
the Commission, strengthened its strategic partnership with the Association of African
Central Banks (AACB). The AACB Bureau accepted to be member of the Governing
Board and the Consultative Forum of AIR.

354. The AIR annual platform, Diaspora Engagement Forum (AIR-DEF), has been
used as a tool for the Europe-based African Diaspora Organizations to discuss ways
and areas of their contribution in the efforts for social and economic development of
Africa.
AIR’s Technical Assistance Program is designed and implemented in AU Member
States. Major achievements/Actions taken during the period under review as follows:

      Technical Assistance (TA) and Capacity Building to AU Member States

355.    The AIR TA program is benefitting 16 Member States including: Democratic
-----------------------Page 84 End-----------------------

                                                                   EX.CL/1214(XXXVI)
                                                                             Page 82

Republic of Congo (DRC), The Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Madagascar, Malawi,
Nigeria, Mauritania, Tanzania and Zimbabwe as well as six countries: Cameroun,
Central African Republic, Chad, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon and Republic of the Congo
through Bank of Central African states (BEAC).

    Capacity Building
356. The Institute holds capacity building workshops for MS with the objective of
improving their capacity on remittance data collection and reporting; and putting in
place appropriate legal and regulatory frameworks on remittances.

     Stakeholders Engagement
357. The 3rd Diaspora Engagement Forum 2019 (AIR-DEF2019) was organized in
The Hague, The Netherlands. The Forum brought together Europe-based Diaspora
Organizations, Diasporas/Migrants, policy makers, development partners and the
private sector to discuss strategies for creating an enabling environment to up scale
the potential impact of remittances. Diaspora engagement is part of the AIR’s
strategies in achieving its objectives of reduction of transfer costs as well as
Leveraging Remittances for Development in Africa.

   Collaboration with other Stakeholders
358. AIR participated on the annual meetings of the Association of African Central
Banks (AACB). The AACB Assembly selected a theme ‘Remittances: Financing
Opportunities for Africa and Roles of Central Banks’ for the continental seminar to be
organized and held in 2020.

359. AIR has participated in various global and continental conferences including
the Global Remittances Working Group (G-RWG), The Global Forum on Remittances,
Investment and Development (GFRID) and others.

     Research Programme
360. Addressing reduction of costs of remittance transfer remains a key agenda for
AIR given the commitment of African and European leaders, in Valletta, in 2015, “to
eliminate remittance corridors with costs higher than 5%, by 2030” as well as the SDG
10.c on the reduction of remittances transfer costs to 3% by 2030, AIR’s Research
Program undertakes study IN different remittance corridors to and within Africa in a
bid to understand market structures and major drivers for high transfer costs.
Accordingly, a study is underway in the South Africa-Zimbabwe corridor, one of the
most expensive corridors in the world. Likewise, preliminary discussions started with
the Central Bank of Egypt to study corridors from the GCC countries to Egypt, the
cheapest corridors in the world with average costs between 2-4%.

K.    CONSOLIDATING PEACE AND SECURITY

361. Interfaith Dialogue Forum (IFDF): The AU- IFDF 3 was held in Chad in 2018,
under the theme ‘Faith in Action’. It elected a new steering committee for the period
2018-2020, to provide leadership in practically implementing the mandate of the
forum. The Steering Committee met in August 2019 in Maputo, Mozambique prior to
the Pope’s visit. The meeting provided a viable platform for the new steering
committee to familiarize themselves on their individual projects, exchange knowledge,
-----------------------Page 85 End-----------------------

                                                                    EX.CL/1214(XXXVI)
                                                                              Page 83

create synergies, and ensure the implementation of key items on the strategic plan
towards the sustenance of the interfaith dialogue in Africa.

362. Interfaith Dialogue on Preventing Violent Extremism (iDove) pilot project
was launched in February 2017 in partnership with GiZ with the aim of using innovative
youth-led approaches to highlight the soft power of religion in preventing violent
extremism. By building on existing initiatives and supporting young people’s
engagement and ideas, iDove develops non-violent approaches and solutions that
strengthen social cohesion and create a forum for exchange and learning. This
initiative is unique for its bottom up approach targeting work done at the community
level through civil society networks and in Africa and the diaspora, namely Europe,
Middle East, and soon South East Asia. The iDove initiative developed a Youth
Preventing Violent Extremism Training of Trainers (TOTs) Manual in 2018, and this
year delivered through its iDovers 3 TOTs; in the Senegal (25-28 March 2019) Balkans
(3-6 May 2019) and South Africa (8-11 August 2019). These ToTs took place as part
of the iDove’s mission to empower youth to play an active role in preventing violent
extremism and building cohesive communities. iDove also carried its 3rd
Intercontinental Youth Forum from 18 to 20 September 2019 in Addis Ababa with the
participation of 44 youth experts from Africa, Europe and the Middle East from different
backgrounds. This enable the participants to enhance their skills in agile project
management, resource mobilization, and project pitching. A series of projects were
developed and pitched to an audience of international and local organizations and
NGOs.

      Full Operationalization of APSA Pillars

363. The Commission intensified its efforts to seek durable solutions to conflicts and
crises on the continent by accelerating the implementation of peace agreements
already concluded by the parties in conflict zones, by strengthening the fight against
terrorism and its related perverse effects, such as extremism, radicalization and
transnational organized crime, as well as by combatting trafficking in drugs and
persons. Furthermore, the AU Policy Framework on Post-Conflict Reconstruction and
Development (PCRD) has been implemented in post-conflict countries through quick-
impact projects aimed at restoring livelihoods and promoting the consolidation of
peace. Among the States that benefited from these efforts are Somalia, Madagascar
and Mali. Activities in the areas of disarmament, demobilization and reintegration, as
well as others within the context of security sector reform, have also been executed in
several Member States, in accordance with the PCRD.

364. Regarding conflict prevention and early warning, the Commission continued to
provide technical assistance for establishing and strengthening national early warning
and response mechanisms in Member States. It also provided support to six (6)
Member States for capacity-building in conflict prevention and early warning.
Collaboration and capacity-building programmes on conflict prevention with RECs
have been implemented, including the launching of a joint AU-COMESA initiative for
the prevention of structural conflicts in Zambia and in other countries. The Panel of
the Wise, through its subsidiary mechanism known as FemWise-Africa, has worked to
promote the inclusion of women in peace processes and to build capacity in mediation
and conflict prevention. FemWise-Africa has provided training and capacity building
for its members. Some of the women who were trained have been deployed to support
-----------------------Page 86 End-----------------------

                                                                      EX.CL/1214(XXXVI)
                                                                                Page 84

peace-making efforts in certain Member States like Sudan and South Sudan.

365. Under the African Union Border Programme (AUBP), the Commission provided
support to sixteen (16) countries in their delimitation, demarcation and reaffirmation
exercises, as well as in the promotion of cross-border cooperation.

366. The Youth for Peace in Africa Programme, which was launched last year, aims
to implement Article 17 of the African Youth Charter, in a bid to facilitate meaningful
participation of African youth in all facets of peace and security efforts. A study is
underway to determine the roles and contributions of African youth in promoting peace
and security on the continent.

367. The Multinational Joint Task Force (MNJTF) is continuing its offensive and
defensive operations against the Boko Haram terrorist group, since it was
commissioned in July 2015, with 10,772 soldiers from Benin, Cameroon, Niger,
Nigeria and Chad. At the present time, security in most of the zones in the MNJTF's
area of operation are relatively calm, although the situation remains unpredictable.
Boko Haram continues to operate in small groups and to focus on islands in Lake
Chad and surrounding areas, as well as to engage in repeated attacks which cause
massive displacement and damage to property. It is important to commend the MNJTF
troop-contributing countries (TCCs) and the Lake Chad Basin Commission (LCBC) for
their efforts, which have severely damaged the Boko Haram terrorist group. However,
it is imperative to mobilize resources for post-conflict reconstruction for the purpose of
reviving communities in the Lake Chad Basin.

368. Regarding the continued strengthening of the African Standby Force (ASF), the
Commission worked closely with Member States, RECs/RMs and other stakeholders
to make the ASF fully operational. A new concept of operation and a new doctrine
have been developed and are being finalized which will facilitate adaptation to the
changing landscape of peace and security in Africa. For its part, the PSC, with the
support of the Commission, continued with the planning for the joint retreat with the
peace and security governing bodies of RECs/RMs scheduled in early 2020.
Furthermore, from 29 August to 3 September 2019, Defence Ministers of volunteer
countries of the African Capacity for Immediate Response to Crises (ACIRC) held a
meeting in Pretoria to discuss the status of ACIRC in relation to the ASF and
recommended that a meeting of ACIRC Heads of State and Government be held on
the sidelines of the 34th Ordinary Session of the Assembly of the Union. It should be
stated here that all Member States that have voluntarily joined the ACIRC deserve to
be commended for their pan-African commitment to promoting peace, security and
stability in Africa.

369. Moreover, the PSC, working diligently on the implementation of the APSA and
the AGA, remains fully seized of the various conflict and crisis situations, as well as of
thematic issues related to peace and security. With the support of the Commission
and other relevant stakeholders, the PSC has taken important decisions to prevent
and resolve conflicts/crises.

370. The situation in Libya remains worrying. The AU continues to work closely with
the United Nations and other international and regional stakeholders to find a lasting
solution to the Libyan conflict. Consultations are continuing with the Secretary-General
-----------------------Page 87 End-----------------------

                                                                         EX.CL/1214(XXXVI)
                                                                                   Page 85

of the United Nations to implement the decision of the AU High Level Committee on
Libya regarding the appointment of a joint AU/UN envoy for Libya. At its 883rd Meeting
held on 27 September 2019, the Peace and Security Council approved the proposal
to appoint a joint African Union/United Nations envoy for Libya to streamline efforts
geared towards the resolution of the Libyan crisis.

371. In the Comoros, the situation has been marked, in recent months, by political
tensions between the ruling party and the opposition. In view of this political context, I
therefore issued a statement inviting the Comorian authorities and all other Comorian
actors to exercise restraint and to engage in an inclusive dialogue in order to preserve
the gains already made in the archipelago following a long period of political crisis. I
urged the authorities and other stakeholders to ensure that all post-election conflicts
are resolved within the framework of the existing regulatory mechanisms.

372. During the reporting period, Somalia continued to make progress in
establishing the federal system. Despite certain difficulties, the Federal Government
of Somalia (FGS) and the Federal Member States (FMS) have made efforts to improve
their relations, particularly regarding electoral issues in some of the federated States.
This trend augurs well for preparing the ground for the general elections scheduled for
2020/2021. AMISOM continues to work closely with Somali security forces, particularly
as part of its mandate to assist the Federal Government in implementing its national
programmes, notably the Somalia Transition Plan and the Somali National Security
Architecture. AMISOM also continues to protect population centres and critical
infrastructure, especially the main supply routes. At the same time, the combined
operations of AMISOM and Somali security forces have reduced the operational
capability and supply channels of the Al-Shabaab terrorist group. However, the group
remains a threat, as evidenced by attacks against civilians, AMISOM and Somali
security forces. It is important that Somali forces prepare to effectively take over from
AMISOM whose departure from Somalia has been scheduled.

373. Following the coup d'état that led to the overthrow of President Hassan Omar
al-Bashir and his government on 9 May 2019 as a result of a popular uprising related
to the increase in the price of bread, the PSC issued a public a statement on 15 April
2019 inviting the Transitional Military Council (TMC), which had taken control of the
country, to set up a civilian transitional authority, and failing which Sudan would be
suspended from participating in all activities of the AU, in accordance with relevant
texts applicable to unconstitutional changes of government. During my visit to Sudan,
I discussed with all stakeholders the need to restore the civilian regime. In May 2019,
I also appointed a special envoy, Ambassador Mohamed Hassan Lebatt, to work
closely with IGAD and stakeholders on the ground to seek a way out of the crisis.
Within the framework of IGAD, Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed visited Sudan on
7 June 2019 and subsequently appointed Ambassador Mohammed Dirir as mediator
in efforts to resolve the crisis.

374. As the Sudanese army was unable to take the necessary measures to set up a
civilian transitional authority within the deadlines set by the PSC, the latter, on 6 June
2019, suspended the Republic of the Sudan from all activities of the AU. The PSC also
reiterated its call for the formation of a civilian-led transitional authority as the only way
to lift Sudan out of the current crisis. The positive developments in the political situation
in Sudan since the suspension decision led the PSC to lift the suspension on 6
-----------------------Page 88 End-----------------------

                                                                   EX.CL/1214(XXXVI)
                                                                             Page 86

September 2019, thus allowing Sudan to regain its position in the Union. I comment
the efforts of Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok towards the stabilization of Sudan. In
this context, it is essential that the AU continue to appeal to the United States
Government to remove Sudan from the list of States sponsoring terrorism in order to
facilitate the socio-economic recovery and development of the country.

375. Since the signing, on 12 September 2018, of the Revitalized Agreement on the
Resolution of the Conflict in the Republic of South Sudan (R-ARCSS), the Commission
has continued to support stakeholders and IGAD in their efforts to effectively
implement the Agreement. As part of the Commission's efforts, Ambassador Smaïl
Chergui, Commissioner for Peace and Security, led a mission to South Sudan on from
10 to 11 May 2019 for consultations with stakeholders on the need for its
implementation without delay and for subsequently establishing an interim
government. He was accompanied by a team comprising Mr Jean-Pierre Lacroix, UN
Under-Secretary-General for Peace Operations, and Dr. Smaïl Wais, IGAD Special
Envoy for South Sudan. The team also included Ambassadors of the High-Level Ad
Hoc Committee for South Sudan, namely Chad, South Africa, Nigeria and Rwanda,
as well as the representative of Algeria. The team drew the attention of the parties to
the urgent need to fully implement the R-ARCSS in letter and spirit, the only way to
end the crisis in their country.

376. The first face-to-face meeting between President Salva Kiir and Mr. Riek
Machar since the signing of the Revitalized Agreement took place in Juba on 9 and
11 September 2019. They later met on 21 October 2019. At both meetings, the two
personalities discussed urgent issues concerning the State, notably security
arrangements, the number of states and their delimitation, as well as the funding
needed to speed up implementation of the extension of the pre-transition period
preceding the formation of the Revitalized Transitional Government of National Unity
(R-TGoNU), which ends on 12 November 2019. I remain confident that the South
Sudanese, with the support of IGAD, the AU, neighbouring countries and the entire
international community, will rise to the challenges facing their country and therefore
restore lasting peace and stability.

377. Regarding developments in Darfur, UNAMID continued its operations while
reducing its staff. UNAMID continues to focus its support on: (a) the peace process,
(b) the establishment of the peace support mechanism which should have been signed
by December 2019, and (c) the Peace Commission. It is therefore important that
adequate resources be made available from the Mission's current budget, to deal with
these immediate priorities. Given the commitment of both the AU and the UN to
support the Sudanese peace process, the United Nations Security Council (UNSC)
met on 10 October 2019 and decided that UNAMID would maintain the same number
of uniformed and civilian staff. In support of the decisions of the PSC and the UNSC,
Ambassador Smaïl Chergui, Commissioner for Peace and Security, and Mr Jean
Pierre Lacroix, UN Under-Secretary-General for Peace Operations, made a visit to
Sudan from 7 to 9 October 2019. During that mission, they discussed with Sudanese
leaders and reaffirmed the continued support of both institutions during the transition
period.

378. The situation prevailing in the States of South Kordofan and Blue Nile is a
source of major concern. The Commission, in consultation with IGAD, continues to
-----------------------Page 89 End-----------------------

                                                                     EX.CL/1214(XXXVI)
                                                                               Page 87

monitor the situation closely and to take appropriate initiatives.

379. The Horn of Africa continues to record positive developments, following the new
chapter opened by Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, who is working with other
regional leaders to place this region on the path to lasting peace, as well as to
sustainable development and integration. The Commission has developed a regional
strategy to address the many challenges in the Horn of Africa. However, developments
in the Gulf region, particularly the war in Yemen and its impact, have aggravated the
insecurity problems in the Horn of Africa. The increasing competition between
countries in the Gulf region, as well as between other external powers seeking to exert
their influence in the region, continues to fuel tensions in the area and to undermine
AU efforts to help stakeholders in the region to meet the challenges they face.

380. In Mali, the political situation is still dominated by efforts made to implement the
Agreement for Peace and Reconciliation, as well as for the organization of the
inclusive national dialogue for purposes of the constitutional and institutional reforms
necessary for transforming the Agreement into national legislation. The signatory
parties have taken steps to accelerate the implementation of key measures in the
agreement. With support from the AU, progress has been made in the accelerated
demobilization, disarmament and reintegration process, with the transfer of over 1,000
armed combatants from the Coordination of the Azawad movements and the training
platform before they were formally integrated into the Malian Defence and Security
Forces (FDSM). It is necessary to emphasise the urgent need to redeploy
reconstituted units in order to restore State authority in northern Mali, including the
return of civilian administration and restoration of basic services, following recent
legislation to establish the Northern Economic Development Zone, especially in Kidal
Region. Mr Pierre Buyoya, High Representative of the AU for Mali and Head of
MISAHEL, as well as other regional actors, are actively supporting the Malian parties
in the implementation of the Agreement.

381. The situation in the Sahel region continues to mobilize international efforts,
including those of the AU. The almost daily attacks in Burkina Faso, increasing inter-
communal violence in the region and the spread of extremist and terrorist attacks in
the area from the south to the Gulf of Guinea are a source of deep concern for the AU.
Countries in the region, including those of ECOWAS and WAMU, are taking decisive
action. The Extraordinary Session of ECOWAS, held in Ouagadougou on 14
September 2019, decided to establish a billion-dollar fund over five years to finance a
plan of action to fight against terrorism and violent extremism. The Commission
attended the Summit and declared itself ready to support the plan of action. During
the reporting period, I constantly advocated for appropriate, predictable and
sustainable financing and logistical support for regional security arrangements such
as the G5-Sahel and the Multinational Joint Working Group, based on African and
regional ownership and a holistic approach to the situation in the Sahel.

382. The general situation in the Central African Republic is marked by a decrease
in violence throughout the country since the signing of the Political Agreement for
Peace and Reconciliation in the Central African Republic (APPR-RCA). The effective
redeployment of State authority is ongoing in several localities in the provinces. For
example, all 16 prefects have assumed duty, and 66 sub-prefects out of the 71
provided for have been appointed. The formation of joint units, involving the security,
-----------------------Page 90 End-----------------------

                                                                      EX.CL/1214(XXXVI)
                                                                                Page 88

the Central African Armed Forces and armed groups was launched on 16 October in
Bouar, in the north-west of the country, in the presence of Faustin Archange Touadera,
President of the Republic, who was accompanied by several ministers and numerous
organizations representing the international community. On the humanitarian front,
UNHCR reported that, from January to September, it noted the assisted spontaneous
return of over 357,000 refugees and displaced persons to their respective regions,
despite the deplorable situation in the Birao camp. Humanitarian needs have reduced
from US $ 2.9 million to US $ 2.6 million and 30,000 persons will return to their regions
by 2020, according to trends published by UNHCR.

383. Although Government's commitment to the Peace Agreement is confirmed,
there are still challenges on the side of the armed groups. Several cases of violations
of the Agreement by the signatory armed groups were noted, in particular on 21 May
2019 by the Retour, Réclamation et Réhabilitation (return, reclamation and
rehabilitation, 3 R) group in September and October 2019, the clashes in Birao
between the groups that signed the Agreement, notably the Mouvement des
libérateurs centrafricains pour la justice (Central African Liberators for Justice
Movement (MLCJ)) and the Front Populaire pour la Renaissance de la Centrafrique
(Popular Front for the Renaissance of the Central African Republic (FPRC)), which
resulted in many deaths that we strongly condemned.

384. The African Union and partners of the Central African Republic have
unceasingly encouraged the Government and the Central African parties to promote
a climate of trust for the effective implementation of the Peace Agreement. From 4 to
7 October 2019, the Commissioner for Peace and Security of the African Union, the
UN Under-Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Operations, and the Director General-
Africa of the European Service for External Action of the European Union conducted
their second joint mission to the Central African Republic. After their consultations with
the President of the Republic, Faustin Archange Touadera, and the actors concerned,
the three officials called for respect of the commitments while implementing the Peace
Agreement, appealed to the international community to strongly mobilize to raise funds
and to support the 2020-2021 elections.

385. My Special Representative is in constant contact with all Central African
stakeholders and assists them in the implementation of this historic agreement. I am
delighted with the launching of the pilot training of mixed units in Bouar in the north-
west of the country, and I urge the partners of the CAR to continue to provide support
to ensure the success of this process, which will speed up the DDR process. Lastly, I
call for the active solidarity of AU Member States and the international community to
provide their technical and financial support for the organization of the 2020-2021
elections, and to support the implementation of socio-economic development projects
as well as the consolidation of peace in the Central African Republic.

386. The political situation in Guinea-Bissau remains a matter of concern, despite
the smooth conduct of the parliamentary elections of 10 March 2019, which reflected
the hope for resolving the recurrent institutional and political crises experienced by the
country since 2015. The refusal by the President of the Republic to appoint Mr.
Domingos Simoes Peres, President of the Partido Africano para a Independência da
Guiné e Cabo Verde (African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde
- PAIGC), which won the legislative elections, to the post of Prime Minister, plunged
-----------------------Page 91 End-----------------------

                                                                       EX.CL/1214(XXXVI)
                                                                                 Page 89

the country into a new crisis, aggravating the institutional crisis linked to the
composition of the bureau of the People's National Assembly (ANP). Thanks to the
collective efforts of the Peace and Security Council of the AU and of ECOWAS, the
President of the Republic appointed a new Prime Minister and set 24 November 2019
as the date for the first round of the presidential election and 29 December as the date
for the second round. The term of office of the President of the Republic has also been
extended and a public prosecutor appointed. The instability of the parliamentary
majority and mistrust within the PAIGC-led government could compromise its duration,
all of which jeopardize the vote on the government's budget.

387. The presidential elections of 24 November 2019 were held, despite financial
and logistical constraints. Indeed, despite donor contributions, a deficit of about $ 1.8
million out of the $ 6 million had to be filled. On 15 October 2019, the Supreme Court
validated 12 of the 19 independent candidates supported by political parties. At the
end of the first round, two candidates remained for the second round which is set for
29 December 2019, namely Domingo Simoes Pereira (47%) and Umaro Sissoco
Embalo (27%). Rising ethnic considerations, trade union demonstrations and
perceptible tensions within the ranks of the military, coupled with drug trafficking and
transnational crimes involving suspects linked to Al-Qaida-affiliated terrorists are
creating a worrying situation in the country. The political and institutional crisis in
Guinea-Bissau is a constant preoccupation for the continent and the international
community. For decades, the Commission, in collaboration with ECOWAS and the
international community, has multiplied initiatives and met with stakeholders
individually and collectively to build lasting peace between brothers and sisters in
Guinea-Bissau. But it is unfortunate to note that, with each agreed solution, other
crises follow. This cycle of crises condemns generations to structural impoverishment
without any prospects for them to improve their living conditions. It is time for political
actors to give absolute priority to the interests of their country before any other
consideration and to pledge to put an end to the cyclical institutional and political crisis
that has undermined the development of Guinea-Bissau for decades. I appeal to all
Member States and to the international community to provide material and financial
support for the proper conduct of the presidential elections of 29 December 2019 and
substantial support to the government that would be elected.

388. With regard to the implementation of the Peace, Security and Cooperation
Framework Agreement (PSCF) for the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and
the region, the AU Liaison Office for the Great Lakes Region and Burundi has
contributed to the effective implementation of its security, political, diplomatic and
economic dimensions. The synergy of action between my Special Representative and
other Special Envoys in the region has consolidated the positions developed by the
partners in their approach to the political and security situation in the Great Lakes
region. This harmonization has facilitated a shared vision between the African Union
(AU), the United Nations (UN), the International Conference on the Great Lakes
Region (ICGLR), the Southern African Development Community (SADC) and the
United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the
Congo (MONUSCO) on countering negative forces, repatriating unarmed combatants
and neutralizing the Forces démocratiques de libération du Rwanda (Democratic
Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda, FDLR) and the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF).
In the same vein, I would like to commend the efforts of the DRC authorities, in
collaboration with the Commission and the World Health Organization (WHO), to
-----------------------Page 92 End-----------------------

                                                                    EX.CL/1214(XXXVI)
                                                                              Page 90

contain the Ebola outbreak.

389. In Burundi, the AU Liaison Office supported the preparation of the mediation
process of the Inter-Burundi Dialogue led by the East African Community (EAC), within
the framework of the Joint Technical Working Group (JTWG). The latter held several
consultations with all stakeholders, including the Government of Burundi, opposition
members inside and outside the country, civil society organizations, the media, youth
and women. In addition, the Commission helped to monitor the human rights and
security situation through its observers and military experts. Human Rights Observers
(HROs) work in collaboration with relevant government agencies and departments and
other stakeholders such as civil society organizations, UN agencies and diplomatic
missions. Military experts (MEs) continue to monitor the overall security situation and
engage with stakeholders, including government actors. In accordance with their
mandate, the HROs and MEs have provided support for targeted training for higher
education institutions, legal practitioners, women's and youth groups.

390. The Gambia has continued to enjoy political stability since the return to
constitutional order in the country. Significant progress has been made in terms of
reforms. The institution and establishment of the National Commission on Human
Rights and the Truth, Reconciliation and Reparations Commission, among others, are
indicators of the Government's determination to promote stability in the country.
Similarly, the African Union, through its Technical Support to The Gambia (AUTSTG)
team, provided technical support to thematic areas such as Security Sector Reform
(SSR), rule of law and transitional justice. This support capped with the formulation of
the first national security policy ever developed by The Gambia, which was adopted
in June 2019. The AU is currently working with ECOWAS and other partners to provide
support to The Gambia, in the design and implementation of all institutional reforms.


  AU SPECIAL ENVOY ON WOMEN, PEACE AND SECURITY
391. The activities of the Office of the Special Envoy on Women, Peace and Security
for the year 2019 were conducted along two major strands within her mandate, namely
Bridging the gap between policies and their implementation and enhancing the role
and leadership of women in peace processes. This report covers the following
activities:

           a. Bridging The Gap Between Policy and Implementation

392. Launch of the Continental Results Framework (CRF) on 4 February 2019, on
margin of the 32nd Assembly of the AU Heads of State and Government and
subsequent dissemination meetings in New York during the 63rd Session of the
Commission on the Status of Women in New York from 11th -15th March, 2019 and
Namibia, on 10-11 April 2019.

393. The Office of the Special Envoy also launched and presented of the Second
Report of the Chairperson on the status of implementation of the Women, Peace and
Security Agenda in Africa, to the Peace and Security Council at its annual open
session on Women, Peace and Security on 17 October 2019, the report received many
positive comments from the Council including on the potential to create a base for
-----------------------Page 93 End-----------------------

                                                                     EX.CL/1214(XXXVI)
                                                                               Page 91

Member States to streamline the role of women on peace and security issues in
national programmes. The Council reiterated its call to AUC to institutionalize the
Office of the Special Envoy on women, Peace and Security, in the context of
undergoing AU reforms. In preparation for the second report a meeting is scheduled
in Dakar in December 2019 in Dakar, Senegal from 17 to 19 December 2019.

394. The Special Envoy participated in the Open debate of the United Security
Council on Women, Peace and Security on 29 October 2019. The open debate was
convened under the Presidency of the Republic of South Africa.



          b. Enhance The Role and Leadership Of Women In Peace Processes

395. The “African Women Leaders Network” (AWLN) is a ground-breaking
movement of African women leaders, jointly supported by the African Union
Commission (AUC) and the United Nations (UN), through the leadership of the AUC
Chairperson. The Offices of the AU Special Envoy in fulfilment of her mandate to
coordinate the work of the Network has undertaken a number of activities with the aim
to enhance the role and leadership of Women. Including the following:

   i) The Third Steering Committee in Monrovia, Liberia AWLN Steering to
        strategize on how to implement the flagship projects identified for each pillar
        of the Network;
   ii) Launch of the African Women Leaders Network (AWLN) Friends in Addis
        Ababa in June 2019 to provide partners with a formal mechanism through which
        AWLN initiatives will be technically and financially supported;
   iii) Intergenerational retreat on Women leadership.

396. In Nairobi, Kenya from 16 to 18 August, 2019, under the theme: Women
Leadership in Africa: “Building the Africa We Want Together”. The retreat adopted also
a Roadmap 2020 – 2022 as part of the AWLN Young Women’s leadership pillar for
meaningful young women’s engagement and participation in governance, peace and
security, with the support of Senior Women Leaders:

   i) The African Women Leadership Funds Advisory Board Meeting on 8 November
        2019. To review the progress made in structuring the Fund, selecting fund
        managers; and agree on fundraising strategies;
   ii) Solidarity Mission to Sudan: 26 to 30 August 2019.The Special Envoy
        undertook a Solidarity Mission to Sudan from 26 to 30 August, The Solidarity
        Mission with the aim to support women of Sudan in their endeavours for a
        democratic, peaceful and inclusive Sudan that incorporates women in decision-
        making at all levels. An indicator of the success of the mission is the fact that
        a new government was announced few days after the solidarity mission and
        comprised 4 women ministers, including the first ever Minister for Foreign
        Affairs;
   iii) Joint AU- UN Joint Solidarity Mission to the Horn of Africa from Monday 21st to
        Saturday 26th October 201 to support initiatives in the region with the view to
        strengthening women’s leadership and participation in peace, security and
        development, in line with AU Agenda 2063. A key outcome of the mission was

                                                                     EX.CL/1214(XXXVI)
                                                                               Page 92

        the Establishment of the AWLN National Chapter in Ethiopia, under the
        leadership of the President of the Federal Republic of Ethiopia, H.E. Sahle-
        Work Zewde.

397. The Office continues to actively carry out its mandate and mission, under the
overall leadership of the chairperson of the Commission.

398. Despite the delivery on its mandate, the Office continue to work under
strenuous conditions and it is in this perspective that the Peace and Security council
has reiterated its call for the Office to be institutionalized on Women, Peace and
Security, to afford the Office with further support, particularly in terms of Human
capacity.

399. In 2020, the Office will focus on National Action plans with proximity work with
Member States to attain 50% of Member States with Action Plans, but also more
countries reporting using the Continental Results Framework. The Office will also
convene the second Forum of Regional Women, Peace and Security Forums and the
third AWLN in the continued endeavour to enhance the role and leadership of Women
towards the transformation of Africa in a peaceful, prosperous and inclusive continent,
where no one is left behind.


L.      ENHANCING AFRICA’S ROLE AND POSITION IN
        AFRICA AND GLOBALLY
     I. Engaging Civil Society and the Diaspora

      ECOSOCC

400. Pursuant to the decision of the Executive Council, the ECOSOCC Secretariat
was transferred to Lusaka, Republic of Zambia. The Headquarters Agreement
between the AU and Zambia was signed in July 2019, in the margins of the Summit in
Niamey, Niger. The recruitment process also began and the first batch of staff
appointed have already been deployed. In view of the reform of ECOSOCC requested
by the Executive Council, a study thereon was finalised and will be submitted for
consideration by the policy organs.

401. Following the recruitment of the first group of new staff for the Secretariat in the
3rd quarter of 2019, and in preparation for their imminent deployment to the new
Secretariat in Lusaka, a second interdepartmental team undertook a final evaluation
mission from 13 to 15 November 2019 to establish the readiness of the new
Secretariat facility in line with the provisions of the Host Agreement. The evaluation
mission was followed immediately by an installation mission composed of various
technical team from 15 to 30 November 2019 with a mandate to ensure that the new
office premises were appropriately furnished and equipped in order to support the
operational requirements of the Secretariat. The Commission is pleased to report that
the Secretariat of ECOSOCC has relocated to Lusaka Zambia and have started
operation.
-----------------------Page 95 End-----------------------

                                                                   EX.CL/1214(XXXVI)
                                                                             Page 93

    African Diaspora Volunteer Corps Project

402. The pilot project for the establishment of an African diaspora volunteer corps
was initiated by a three-month training course for young volunteers from the diaspora
from January to March 2019. The selection of these young persons followed the same
rules as those governing the recruitment of young volunteers serving within the
Commission. These young people, who came from the regions of the Americas and
the Middle East, were deployed to the AU Permanent Mission to the United States in
Washington, D.C., and to the Commission in Addis Ababa. At the end of this first
professional experience, the Commission would like to make the following
recommendations: (i) integrate the youth project of the diaspora into that of the AU
Youth Volunteers Corps; (ii) ensure proximate deployment by sending the youth to AU
Offices located in the diaspora regions where they reside. The main limitation of this
pilot project is that it excluded all members of the African diaspora who do not hold
passports issued by their countries of origin. The Commission is working towards
harmonizing Member States’ laws on granting dual nationality.

    African Diaspora Investment Fund

403. The Commission is helping to implement an innovative financial strategy to
boost diaspora investment, in line with the 5 flagship projects adopted at the Diaspora
Summit held in South Africa in May 2012. This strategy is based on the creation,
marketing and issuance of bonds, mutual funds, as well as endowment and trust funds
through the African Diaspora Finance Corporation (ADFC). This strategy was
validated by Member States, relevant AU offices, the private sector, development
banks and financial experts at a meeting held for that purpose.

    Participation of the Diaspora in the Productive Economy

404. The Commission launched a programme to improve the performance of African
Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) on the continent and in the Diaspora, as
advocated by the May 2012 Diaspora Summit mentioned above. This project focuses
on the acquisition of targeted skills and resources to help these enterprises expand in
order to create new jobs. This programme was conducted from 16 to 18 August 2019
in Dar es Salem, Tanzania, with a focus on leadership training. It was part of a series
of actions devoted to training, self-learning, counselling and follow-up, which led
participants to reflect on their own functioning and strategy. Thus, they acquired new
knowledge that has helped them to execute the development plans of their enterprises
in a realistic and individualized manner. Most of these enterprises will make a real
impact on their social environment. It should be noted, however, that the most
important challenge facing SMEs remains access to finance, as their attractiveness to
investors is still low.

    Involving the Diaspora

405. The African Union is strengthening its relations with the Diaspora by involving
it in Regional Consultative Conferences (RCCs) which serve as a platform for
advocacy and policy formulation. In general, the RCCs constitute a framework that
serves to improve convergence between national and continental diaspora strategies,
-----------------------Page 96 End-----------------------

                                                                     EX.CL/1214(XXXVI)
                                                                               Page 94

in line with the recommendations of the Global African Diaspora Summit held in 2012,
on the one hand, and the promotion of Agenda 2063, decisions and themes of AU
Summits, on the other hand.

    Strengthening the Capacity of Member States to Assess Diaspora
     Engagement

406. A Diaspora Engagement Self-Assessment Tool (DESAT) has been designed
to serve as a mechanism to help Member States monitor and report on the level of
commitment/involvement of their respective Diasporas. The Commission will use the
results of this self-assessment tool to draw lessons and organize capacity-building
sessions to enable Member States meet the challenges they face. This tool was rolled
out in a pilot phase in 11 Member States. The report showed shortcomings and
highlighted positive examples of best practices in the process of engaging the diaspora
on the continent. In the same vein, the panel discussions organized with the African
diplomatic corps, notably those in Brussels, Belgium, and Beijing, China, in November
2019, helped to enhance understanding of the role of the diaspora, on the one hand,
and to stress the expected role of African diplomatic missions in boosting the
commitment of African Diasporas, on the other hand. The ultimate aim is to urge the
African diaspora to proactively play its role in the development process of the continent
by achieving a good understanding of Agenda 2063.

    Organizing the Work of the Commission with the Diaspora

407. The Commission structured its work on the diaspora around the following three
main regions of the world: (i) the Americas and the Caribbean; (ii) Europe, and (iii) the
Middle East, Asia and Oceania. A summary description of the main activities executed
in each of these regions is presented below.

Americas and the Caribbean:

408. May 2018: Establishment of the African Union Network in Canada to facilitate
the development, planning and joint implementation of development initiatives in
cooperation with the African Diaspora in Canada. During the year under review, this
network continued its campaign to give greater visibility to the African Union in
Toronto, Canada. Consequently, on the occasion of the 56th Anniversary of the OAU,
events were held from 22 to 25 May in the Ontario Parliament and the AU flag was
indeed raised there on 25 May 2019 on this occasion. The network also launched the
Diaspora Youth Entrepreneurship Campaign from 11 to 13 October 2019 to engage
the private sector in Canada to support the Chairperson of the Commission's Initiative,
“1 million by 2021”.

409. February 2019: The Commission undertook to expand the diaspora network to
the United States of America, particularly the west coast and the mid-western area.

Europe

410. The Commission put in place a stakeholder mechanism to stimulate more
active commitment on the part of the diaspora. As part of this mechanism, several
strategic meetings were held, including:
-----------------------Page 97 End-----------------------

                                                                   EX.CL/1214(XXXVI)
                                                                             Page 95


   i)     The African Diaspora Youth Forum in Europe (ADYFE) with UNIDO, from
          13 to 15 January 2019 to discuss the modalities of a strategic partnership
          focused on youth involvement in the development of the continent and
          possibilities for the reintegration of illegal migrants from the Diaspora;
   ii)    Board of Directors of the African Diaspora Development Platform (ADEPT)
          held in Brussels, Belgium, from 1 to 2 April 2019. ADEPT is the umbrella
          organization for the diasporas responsible for policies in Europe, which was
          chosen to represent the African diaspora in Europe from 2018 to 2020;
   iii)   Forum of International Solidarity Organizations for Migration (FORIM),
          which brings together more than 1,000 Diaspora sub-organizations in
          France;
   iv)    Round table discussion between main stakeholders of the Diaspora and the
          Commission on 4 July 2019 in London, United Kingdom, focusing on how
          to increase the visibility of the Union and the involvement of the Diaspora;
   v)     One-day workshop for networks and organizations of the African Diaspora
          held in Frankfurt, Germany, on 3 September 2019, to enhance the visibility
          of the various Diaspora actors, and to define specific areas of engagement
          with the AU. The Commission is also working with the Diaspora to develop
          a narrative to counter the rise of identity and xenophobic populist discourse
          in Europe. With the African Diaspora in Vienna, the Commission organized
          a panel discussion with the Austrian Ministry of Education to deconstruct
          the vexatious message conveyed by a defamatory documentary on Africa
          intended for primary schools in Vienna.

Middle East, Asia and Oceania

411. Contact with the Middle East took place in July 2019 with a visit to Kuwait and
the United Arab Emirates. Due to the strong presence of the African Diaspora in the
Middle East and the Gulf region, the purpose of the visit was to engage with the
employment authorities. This mission culminated in the organization of a forum on
migration issues with experts from Africa and the Middle East. The forum ended with
the adoption of a consultative mechanism between the AU and the Middle East.

412. The Regional Consultative Conference for Asia was held in China, in November
2019. In addition to representatives of the Commission, the AU Office in China, the
members of the African diplomatic corps accredited to China and the Diaspora also
participated in the Conference. A roadmap for relations between the AU and the
African Diaspora in China was developed.

413. The Pan-African Australasian Diaspora Network (PAADN) continues to grow. It
has sponsored several African events focusing on women and youth. The non-
integration of African youth into the humanitarian system of the region is a matter of
concern. The workshop with the PAADN on integration and social cohesion was held
in November 2019, and focused on knowledge sharing and the development of a pilot
project to build on the knowledge of the AU and the continent in these areas.

  II. Enhancing positive image through economic self-reliance and
  culture

                                                                   EX.CL/1214(XXXVI)
                                                                             Page 96

          Encyclopaedia Africana Project

414. Workshops of the Encyclopaedia Africana Project have been held in
accordance with the objectives set forth in the First 10-Year Implementation Plan of
Agenda 2063. At these workshop, discussion was centred on the roadmap for project
financing, the reconstitution of the Scientific Committee to produce the scholarly
content for the Encyclopaedia, the role of the African Union in the project
implementation, and the structure and content of the next edition of the Encyclopaedia.
The discussion also was on transforming the EAP Secretariat in Ghana to a pan Africa
institution on the establishment of the Scientific Committee to develop the framework
for the next edition of the Encyclopaedia Africana. During the February Summit 2019,
the project was approved as a flagship programme of the African Union. A planning
meeting with the AU and the EAP secretariat scheduled in December to inform
detailed project planning and implementation for the two years leading to the
completion of the project.

    III. Africa’s Role in Global and Regional Institutions

     Coordinating Africa’s global engagement on trade

415. The Commission continued to follow up on various international trade issues
that are relevant to Africa. In this regard, it accompanied Member States eligible for
the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) in the utilization of the Act as well as
in the WTO processes.

416. With regard, to AGOA, the Commission organized the 2019 AGOA Midterm
Review, which evaluated its utilization by the eligible Member States. The Review also
prepared recommendations that were considered during the 2019 AGOA Forum that
took place from 4 to 6 August 2019, at the same time the Commission signed a Joint
Statement with the United States Government on the development of the AfCFTA.
The USA expressed its intention to enter into a Free Trade Agreement with respective
African countries, especially, in the wake of the expiry of AGOA in 2025. However, the
Commission led the African side to inform the USA that such a move would jeopardize
the establishment of the AfCFTA and it urged the African side to speak with one voice,
engage with the USA as one block and to refrain from entering into FTAs with third
parties until when the AfCFTA is well established.

417. Concerning the WTO processes, on 23 November 2019, the African Group
Ambassadors and Experts had a retreat in Geneva, Switzerland, to take stock of the
progress accomplished since the 11th WTO Ministerial Conference of 2017. This was
particularly in the area of e-commerce following the decision by a group of countries
to start discussions on rules at the WTO despite the lack of a ministerial mandate. The
African Ambassadors also shared their reflections on the processes leading up to and
at MC12. Special consideration was given to the replacement of the position of WTO
Director General, which will become vacant on 31 August 2020. In this regard, the
Commission recalled the Decision of the 12th Extraordinary Summit directing “the
African Ministers of Trade (AMOT) to work towards ensuring that Africa succeeds in
getting the position and contributes to the strengthening of the multilateral trading
system following the established AU relevant processes and procedures.”

                                                                    EX.CL/1214(XXXVI)
                                                                              Page 97


418. The Commission also recalled the principle of speaking with one voice in
international organisations and urged all Member States to rally behind the African
candidate to be endorsed by the Summit in February 2020. Additionally, the
Commission provided an update on the implementation of the AfCFTA Agreement,
since its entry into force; and stressed the need to ensure that WTO agreements are
well aligned to the AfCFTA and contribute to facilitate its process. The retreat came
up with concrete recommendations on ensuring that there is coherence with the
AfCFTA priorities and the African Group’s negotiating agenda in the WTO, addressing
key policy questions confronting the African Group in respect to current dynamics in
the WTO and defining a way forward for the African Group on the remaining Doha
negotiations issues.

419. On another aspect, the Commission took part at the 2nd High-Level UN
Conference on South-South Cooperation (BAPA + 40), that took place in Buenos
Aires, Argentina, from 22 to 23 March 2019. It stressed that the AfCFTA Agreement
provides for a framework for further promoting South-South Cooperation placing Africa
at the position to negotiate continent to continent agreements with other regions of the
South such as the Southern Common Market (MERCOSUR), the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), as well as the Caribbean regions.

M.      SERVICE DELIVERY, PARTNERSHIPS AND
        OUTREACH
a. Enhance, Strengthen and Sustain Accountability across the Union
420. During the period under review, the Commission strived to strengthen its
institutional capacity. In this respect, it took measures to improve, on a continuous
basis, the performance and operational efficiency of the Commission structures in
terms of finance, human resources and administration, legal, strategic planning,
internal audit, conference, medical and protocol services, through benchmarking and
inspiration of international best practices.

421. The Commission Medium Term Plan (MTP) 2018-2023 was implemented
through close monitoring of administrative and financial issues, in light of ongoing
institutional reforms and especially the Decision of the 11th Extraordinary Summit of
November 2018.

422. The Commission continued to improve the budgeting process and financial
management, identifying wastages and ensuring full compliance with the AU Financial
Rules and Regulations (FRR).

423. The Commission also focused on Service Delivery and Capacity building
priority areas in line with Agenda 2063 and its First Ten Year Implementation Plan
such as:

     i) Strengthening of AU Budgetary process and pursuit of a financially sustainable
        and viable Union;
-----------------------Page 100 End-----------------------

                                                                    EX.CL/1214(XXXVI)
                                                                              Page 98

   ii) Strengthening and sustaining accountability through implementation of Audit
        recommendations within the Union;
   iii) Streaming the work of the Policy Organs and promote synergies with AU
        Organs, Regional Economic Communities (RECs) and other stakeholders.

424. In its efforts to build a well-governed institution, the Commission continued to
reinforce the corporate governance frameworks and systems to enhance
accountability in all spheres of management. It directed all departments and offices to
emulate and observe result-based performance. In this regard, a number of
Administrative Policies have been reviewed and new ones adopted and these include
the following:

Administrative Policies

425. The Staff Regulations and Rules (SRR) were reviewed through extensive
consultations with relevant stakeholders, in order to promote good governance across
the board. They will be submitted for consideration by the Policy Organs in
January/February 2020. The New Performance Management Policy and the Travel
Policy were also reviewed and have been approved by the Chairperson. Moreover,
the Code of Ethics and Conduct, and the Harassment Policy as well as policies on
gifts, dress code, financial and asset declarations, conflict of interest management,
and whistle-blower protection policies were drafted in order to strengthen institutional
governance.

Talent Attraction, Recruitment and Selection

426. In line with Executive Council Decision EXT/EX.CL/Dec.1 (XX) of November
2018, to bring on board “10 independent experts to review and improve the AU
Recruitment and Selection System”, the Commission constituted a committee which
submitted an inception report, including an Action Plan in October 2019. This report
will be considered by the Policy Organs in 2020.

Management Support Bodies

427. After the reconstitution of the management support bodies in 2017, most of
them are now operational and continue to support the decision making processes of
the Commission. Monitoring of the functionality of the Management bodies is ongoing
as this provides timely information in order to check their performance with the aim of
improving their contribution to the efficient and effective management of the
Commission. In this regard, the APROB working methods have been developed and
nine policies of the eleven procedures and manuals initially identified have been
completed for consistency, fairness and transparency. The work of the Committee of
Experts on Recruitment will build on the existing frameworks.

Centralization of Audit Recommendations and Responses

428. In order to promote transparency, accountability and confidence within the
Union, the Commission conducted a comprehensive review of the Audit
recommendations and responses. Based on this review, the Commission established
the Internal Accountability Committee (IAC) that is composed of eleven (11) members.
-----------------------Page 101 End-----------------------

                                                                   EX.CL/1214(XXXVI)
                                                                             Page 99

The objective of the IAC is to enhance the Governance and Accountability through an
effective follow up of the implementation of audit recommendations.


Verification and Valuation of the AU Worldwide Asset Portfolio

429. The Union-wide asset verification, tagging and valuation field work was
successfully concluded by the end of 2018 and the report submitted in February 2019.
An updated Union Wide Fixed assets register is now in place. The assessment
recommended as follows:

      i) Need to change titles of those properties in the name of other organizations
           or Governments. Where necessary, value those properties and record in
           the financial records of AU;
      ii) Need to ensure annual physical verification of assets to confirm their
           existence;
      iii) Need to ensure all assets are tagged appropriately;
      iv) Need to implement the various recommendations on the AU asset Portfolio,
           including setting up an oversight governance body based on AU regional
           representation of Member States.

b. Strengthen AU Budgetary processes and pursue a financially
sustainable and viable Union

Strengthen AU Budgetary Process

430. Building on the lessons from 2018, the Commission ensured that the 2020
budget was approved, timely, at the July 2019 Executive Council Session in Niamey,
Niger. The Commission continued to enhance the financial viability and sustainability
of the Commission by ensuring prudent, accountable and transparent use of the
Union’s financial resources and by effectively supporting efforts to help identify and
develop viable alternative sources of finance to support the AU’s programmes. The
Commission also continued to follow up on the implementation of International Public
Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) and the review of the AU Financial Rules and
Regulations as indicated above, expected to be approved in January/February 2020.
Eight (8) of the nine (9) Golden Rules establishing clear financial management and
accountability principles that were approved by the Assembly in January 2018 were
put to immediate implementation to reduce the variance between the budgets and
expenditure.

431. The target of these efforts was that, by end of December 2019, the Commission
would have reformed 75% of its budgeting, financial and accounting systems and
processes. Among the key outputs expected for 2020, the following are to be
achieved:

      i) Enhanced Results Based Budgeting (RBB) and effective financial reporting
           in the African Union;
      ii) Improved financial management and decision making mechanisms;
      iii) Oversight mechanism and processes enabled for improved accountability
           and better financial reporting;
-----------------------Page 102 End-----------------------

                                                                  EX.CL/1214(XXXVI)
                                                                           Page 100

       iv) Financial risks are effectively managed through the implementation of the
           Enterprise Risk Management (ERM);
       v) Member States pay their assessed contributions on a timely basis.

432.   Implementation of the Golden Rules have had the following effects:

       a) Helped to reduce the variance between the budgets and expenditure outturn
          by applying a baseline on revenue and expenditure performances of past
          three years. This led to the 2020 budget decreased by 14% from 2018;
       b) Revenues and expenditures forecast were worked out based on past
          performance which helped to determine the AU’s capacity to mobilize funds
          and spending on budget;
       c) Member States contribution and partner’s receipts were computed in
          advance;
       d) Budget ceilings were introduced and fully applied to the 2019 and 2020
          budgets;
       e) The gradual process to reduce the ratio of operational budget (including
          salaries) to the total budget towards the recommended 30% by 2021 from
          48% and 40% in 2018 and 2019 respectively, is being implemented;
       f) The June 2015 Johannesburg Decision of funding 100% of operational
          budget, 75% of Program budget and 25% of Peace Support operation by
          2021 is right on track. These targets may however be in jeopardy following
          a decision to limit Member States assessed contributions for 2021 to
          US$250,000,000.00        down     from    US$255,159,713.00      in   2020
          (EX.CL/Dec.1069(XXXV));
       g) Mid-year review of budget has now been institutionalized, starting with the
          2019 budget. This helped to determine the following:

             i) Department’s capacity to absorb the unspent budgets;
             ii) Implementation plan highlighting how the unspent budgets will be
                  absorbed by 31, December 2019 agreed within the Commission;
             iii) Transfer of unspent budgets from one department to the other;
             iv) Dropping of some budget line items that may not be implemented
                  during the year;
             v) Allocation of any savings to new budget items, if necessary.

433. The process to translate the Golden Rules into AU’s policy and procedures as
well as within the revision of the Financial Rules and Regulations is underway.

Reserve, Peace and Security Funds

434. In pursuit of financial prudence and accountability, the Commission followed up
on sources of investment of the Peace Fund before its operationalization and re-
enforcement of the Reserve and other Special Funds.

435. Against a target of US$195 million (US$65 million each for 2017, 2018 and
2019), Member States have as of 10 October 2019 contributed just over US$131
million, representing 67% of the funds expected. This is in response to Assembly
Decision Assembly/AU/Dec.605(XXVII) where it was decided that Member States
contribute to the Peace Fund an amount of US$325 million in 2017, gradually
-----------------------Page 103 End-----------------------

                                                                                     EX.CL/1214(XXXVI)
                                                                                              Page 101

increasing to US$400 million by 2020. The deadline for endowing the Fund has now
been extended by 24 months, through Executive Council’s decision
EX.CL/Dec.1061(XXXV)).

436. Investment of the Peace fund since May 2019 with ECO Bank in Nairobi, Kenya
was effected with 2.85 % interest as follows:

             i) Investment of 34.4 Million of the peace fund on 27 May 2019 and earned
                  interest of $244,470 by end of 27 Aug 2019;
             ii) Investment of 66.9 Million of the Peace Fund on 31 Aug 2019 to earn
                  interest of $481,811 by end of Nov 2019.
             iii) Total interest earned for 6 months is USD 726,281.00.

Implementation of the 0.2% Import Levy

437. As of 11 October 2019, seventeen (17) countries1 were collecting the 0.2%
import levy, representing about 31% of AU membership. Collectively, their assessed
contribution for 2019 make up 29% of the total assessed to Member States. All the 17
countries have remitted to AU either partially or in full for 2019 budget. Sixteen (16)2
of the levy collecting countries have cleared all arrears they had prior to starting
implementing the levy. Collectively, these countries are assessed US$79,925,060.00
for regular budget and US$18,551,000.00 as contribution to Peace Fund, representing
29%, respectively.

438. Only 17 countries out of the 55 Member States are collecting from the levy.
Though funds are being collected, they are not remitted in full by some Member States.
There is no enforcement mechanism to ensure that the money collected is actually
transmitted. Some countries, such as Seychelles and Mauritius, have undertaken a
zero tariff commitment at the WTO on almost 95% of their imports. Imposing the levy
on the remaining goods would only yield less than what is required to pay to AU.
Similarly, doing so would be in breach of GATT Article II on schedules of commitments.

439. Similarly, a number of Small Island States have raised concerns that their
economies are small and not diversified, depending mainly on tourism. These
countries have indicated that an increase in the tariffs on the small quantity of imports
could potentially weaken their economies. Other Member States are constrained by
legal implications under their obligations to the WTO, especially with the Most
Favoured Nation (MFN) principle. The MFN principle requires that WTO members
apply the same tariffs on a like product imported from other WTO members.

440. Some countries, such as the Saharawi Arab Democratic Republic, do not have
a tangible productive industry or the export sector. Their imports mostly for
humanitarian purposes are for sustaining the refugees.

Expenditure Monitoring and Reporting

  Kenya, Gambia, Congo Brazzaville, Gabon, Rwanda, Cameroun, Chad, Sierra Leone, Djibouti, Cote d’Ivoire,
Guinea, Benin, Sudan, Ghana, Nigeria, Mali and Togo
2
  Only Sudan still has arrears probably due to the ongoing economic embargo that makes it difficult to remit
funds to AU on time
-----------------------Page 104 End-----------------------

                                                                        EX.CL/1214(XXXVI)
                                                                                 Page 102


441. The process of automating its account with the Commercial Bank of Ethiopia
with a view to having real-time host to host linkage between the Bank and the
Commission has started. Now, it is at testing stage. Automating bank reconciliation for
Commission HQ Accounts has been completed. Thus far, the Bank reconciliations is
up-to-date.

442. Plans are underway to make the Travel Policy more robust and avoid any room
for misinterpretation. Among others, AU staff are not allowed to be on mission for more
than 21 days in a quarter, and travel on business class is limited to certain category of
personnel as per decisions of policy organs.

443. Migration from using cheques for payment transaction and now using bank
transfers has been introduced. This has shortened the processing time by two days.
Approval to rollout the use of visa cards for paying DSA and other payments to all staff
was secured. The funds will be loaded unto respective cards internally at the
Commission.

444. Cash and Liquidity Management module has been implemented in SAP to
monitor cash balance in the various accounts.

Reformulated Scale of Assessment

445. The reformulated Scale of Assessment has been approved by the Assembly in
February 2019. The new Scale has applied the following principles: Equitable burden
sharing; Ability to pay; Solidarity; Avoidance of risk of concentration.

446. It has also introduced the “Caps and Minima’s” such that no Member State will
pay less than US$350,000 and no one paying more than US$35 million in any given
year.

Sanctions Regime

447. Contributions from Member States are often not remitted on time and/or not
paid at all. Under the previous sanctions regime, Member States non-payment were
classified to be in default only if they were in arrears for two full years. This resulted to
a trend where about 33% of the assessed contributions were regularly held in arrears.

448. A new Sanctions regime was adopted in November 2018 by the Assembly
through Decision Ext/Assembly/AU/Dec.3(XI). This new sanction’s regime seeks to,
among others, shorten the period within which a Member State will be considered to
be in default to six (6) months from two (2) years. It has also placed emphasis on
compliance by introducing a phased application of sanctions should a Member State
be in default. It also has provided relief to Member States who default due to
circumstances that make them temporarily unable to pay their assessed contributions.




c. Streamlining the Work of Policy Organs and Promoting synergy
-----------------------Page 105 End-----------------------

                                                                     EX.CL/1214(XXXVI)
                                                                              Page 103

with other AU Organs, the Regional Economic Communities (RECs)
and other Stakeholders

Streamlining the Work of the Policy Organs

449. The Office of the Secretary General of the Commission ensured preparations
and coverage of meetings of the policy organs, as well as retreats between the
Permanent Representatives’ Committee and other organs. 2019 was marked by the
beginning of the implementation of the Assembly decision instituting a single ordinary
session of the Assembly, the July session henceforth being devoted to the
Coordination Meeting between the AU, RECs and Regional Mechanisms (RM), at the
level of Heads of State and Government. Pursuant to its mandate, the Office of the
Secretary General of the Commission ensured coverage of all the meetings held in
2019 by the different policy organs of the Union.

450. Within the context of greater appropriation of the decisions of the organs by the
Groups of African Ambassadors in the main non-African capital cities, at the request
of the Group of African Ambassadors in Washington DC, the Secretary General of the
Commission held an interactive session with the said Group, during which he
presented the decisions and outcomes of the Niamey meetings of July 2019. This
practice should be generalised to give the actors concerned the same understanding
of AU decisions.

451. With a view to harmonising AU working documents in compliance with the
request of the Executive Council, the Office of the Secretary General of the
Commission developed reporting formats for Specialized Technical Committees and
PRC Sub-Committees.

452. Taking into consideration the need to strengthen coordination in order to
improve the effectiveness of the Commission’s activities, the digitalization of the
meeting organisation process and inter-departmental coordination was introduced.

Coordination of UN Regional Mechanism (UN-RCM)

453. In order to strengthen the joint work between the Commission and UNECA, the
Deputy Chairperson formed a Secretariat within the Commission that would focus on
(RCM-Africa) and the seven priorities of the Commission: Regional Integration,
Silencing the Gun by 2020, Climate Change, Gender, women and Youth, Capacity
building, Clear Division of labour, and Theme of the year, which have been included
in thematic clusters. This engagement has led so far to better clarity of roles and areas
of support/assistance expected from development partners (UN) in the context of the
ongoing institutional Reforms within the African Union and the United Nations System.
The RCM-Africa Stakeholders meeting that took at the Commission in September
2019, emphasized the need for high level AU Leadership engagement within the
current UN transitional arrangements for the Africa Region to ensure that the new
systems being established effectively caters to the development priorities and vision
of the AU. This led to the establishment of an AU Ad-Hoc RCM-Africa Secretariat to
serve as the focal point for consultations and collaboration with the UN Economic
Commission for Africa.
-----------------------Page 106 End-----------------------

                                                                        EX.CL/1214(XXXVI)
                                                                                 Page 104

d. Audit Matters
454. The Office of Internal Audit (OIA) prepared its plan for the year 2019 using a
risk assessment methodology of Audit Management System (MKInsight) and inputs
from management. In addition, the OIA did set its audit priorities based on the results
of the mapping exercise on domestication of the First Ten Year of Implementation Plan
of Agenda 2063. The OIA’s key priority areas include:
          i) Providing assurance services on the adequacy of AU’s Governance,
              Risk Management and Controls, so that AU objectives are achieved;
          ii) Providing audit support services in ensuring that the institutional
              capacities of AU are improved, and relations with strategic and other
              partners are strengthened.

455. The OIA Annual Audit Plan for the year 2019 covered a total of 45 audit projects
on both the Headquarters and Outstation offices (AU Organs, Field Missions,
Regional, Representational and Specialized Offices). The annual plan includes
various kinds of audits namely: financial, certification, compliance, operational
(performance audits) as well as information technology (IT) audits. It also includes
staff development activities in line with the Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA) standards.
The OIA also undertook 12 projects that were not in the 2019 plan but were requests
from management or investigation projects, included under the special requests was
the audit verification of the salary arrears for the AU staff for the years 2015, 2016 and
2017. This exercise which extended into the second half of the year took a substantial
amount of audit time. Majority of the OIA audit projects (outstations) are due to be
conducted in the second half of the year.

456. Therefore, the impact of OIA audit activities during the period may be
summarized as follows:

           i) OIA audit reports issued during the year assisted management at
               various levels to review the controls and ensure that strong internal
               controls are maintained;
           ii) OIA audit reports were also shared with the AU Board of External
               Auditors (BoEA). Reliance of OIA reports by the BoEA saves the amount
               of time and cost that could be incurred on audit of the financial
               statements of the Commission and other AU organs.

457. The OIA has been preparing its annual plan and conducting the audits based
on its own risk assessment since there is no risk management function in place. The
Commission is still working on the framework for risk management. In reiteration, it is
recommended that the Commission should expedite the setting up of a unit to oversee
implementation of a risk management system in the organization in due course.

458. However, the OIA structure has a large proportion of staff who are under
Partner Funds leading to high staff-turnover since their contracts are on short term
basis. It is hoped that the ongoing restructuring exercise should address these and
other structural challenges.

Institutional Audit

                                                                   EX.CL/1214(XXXVI)
                                                                            Page 105

459. The Commission underwent the institution assessment for qualification for EU
funding by the European Union where 7 pillars were audited including internal control,
Accounting, External Audit, Grants, and Procurement. The audit concluded that the
Commission had become IPSAS compliant.

460. Audit issues are being addressed and being tracked for progress on status of
implementation. The major ones were:

          i) Follow-up was done and most are cleared during 2019. The balance
              amount of outstanding imprest will be deducted from arrear salaries in
              October 2019 and the rest from salaries starting from November 2019
              payroll due to the high amount involved per person;
          ii) Interoffice balances: most of the old accounts are reconciled and it will
              be reduced further by end of year.

461. Assets: An internal Task Force has been established to address all issues
raised by auditors. Physical inventory is to be undertaken before end of year to be
updated in the accounting records. Various adjustments were done in SAP to reconcile
issues raised.

e. STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIPS

Evaluation of Strategic Partnerships

462. In Addis Ababa, in January 2017, the Executive Council issued Decision
EX.CL/Dec.942(XXX), which took note of the report of the PRC on the Evaluation of
the Strategic Partnerships, and requested the PRC with the Commission to hold
further discussions on all aspects of strategic partnership, in order to formulate
appropriate proposals and recommendations. Following deliberations by the Sub-
Committee of the Whole on Multilateral Cooperation and the PRC and in close
collaboration with the Commission, the Report of the Evaluation of the AU strategic
partnerships, was re-submitted to the Executive Council during its Thirty-Fourth and
Thirty-Fifth Ordinary Sessions held respectively held from 7 to 8 February 2019 in
Addis Ababa, Ethiopia and 4-5 July 2019 in Niamey, Niger. In both meetings, the report
was returned to the subcommittee on Multilateral Cooperation for further deliberations.
The Subcommittee of the Whole on Multilateral Cooperation is organizing a retreat
from 13 to 16 December 2019 in order to conclude deliberations on the evaluation of
strategic partnerships.

463. The Executive Council noted the absence of consensus regarding the format
of participation in Partnerships’ Meetings and, in referring the item back to the Sub-
Committee on Multilateral Cooperation for further review, requested that the
Ambassadors deliberate to achieve consensus on the matter, particularly in light of
the challenges that the Union has been facing in implementing existing participation
decisions. Attaining consensus among Member States around the evaluation findings
will enable the Union to move forward in an organized manner on its priority to
strengthen Africa’s global voice and representation.

                                                                              Page 106

464. The Commission has continued to implement policy organ decisions pertaining
to strategic partnerships, particularly in the context of Africa-Arab, FOCAC, TICAD,
AU-EU, Africa-Turkey, Africa-India partnerships, as follows:

    Africa-Arab

465. In line with the Malabo 2016 Africa-Arab Summit Declaration and Resolutions,
the Commission has pursued a close and continued engagement with the Arab side
through the following high level meetings: The 8th General Cooperation Meeting
between the African Union Commission and the General Secretariat of the League of
Arab States; the 13th and 14th Meetings of the Senior Officials of the African Union –
Arab Partnership Coordination Committee held on 2 May 2019 at the League of Arab
States Headquarters in Cairo, Egypt and on 11 September 2019 at the AU Head
Quarters and the 7th Ministerial Meeting of the Coordination Committee of the Africa-
Arab Partnership held at the Headquarters of the United Nations in New York on 23
September 2019. During all these engagements, the Commission did not spare any
effort to stress on the importance for a timely preparation for the 5th Africa-Arab
Summit to be held in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia (KSA). However, the African side has been
informed of the postponement of the 5th Africa-Arab Summit initially scheduled to be
held in Riyadh. The Commission stands ready to work with the LAS to prepare for 5th
Africa-Arab Summit postponed to 2020 by Saudi Arabia.

    FOCAC

466. In line with the outcomes of the Beijing 2018 FOCAC Summit, the Commission
engaged with the Chinese side and signed in May 2019 a “Cooperation Plan on Jointly
Promoting the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road
between the Government of the People’s Republic of China and the Commission”.
The aim of the Cooperation plan is to ensure the establishment of an appropriate
implementation mechanism through which China will scale up its cooperation in
supporting the programs of the Union, notably the support to the Africa Center for
disease Control and Prevention ( Africa ACDC) in addition to the construction of the
Headquarters of the Africa CDC, the development of training programs, the setting-up
of a China-AU Joint Working Group of trans-national and trans-regional Infrastructure
Cooperation in Africa to support the implementation of the Program for Infrastructure
Development in Africa (PIDA) as well to support other programs on Agriculture
Development and promoting cooperation on innovation and entrepreneurship between
Chinese and African young people, and facilitating technology transfer to Africa.

    TICAD

467. The 2019 TICAD Summit (TICAD 7) marked 26 years since the first TICAD
Summit held in Tokyo, in 1993. TICAD 7 Summit and its Preparatory Meetings were
hosted by the Government of Japan, in Yokohama, Japan, on 26 - 30 December 2019,
under the theme: “Advancing Africa’s Development through People, Technology and
Innovation” and witnessed, for the first time, the participation of all AU Member States.
The Summit provided the opportunity for the African Union and Japan to re-design the
future of a win-win relation with a view to accelerating Africa’s development as
encapsulated in Agenda 2063, and to reaffirm the importance of human resources,
agriculture, infrastructure and industrialization for Africa’s transformation. The Summit

                                                                    EX.CL/1214(XXXVI)
                                                                             Page 107

also re-emphasized the critical role of the Private Sector through a dedicated dialogue
with policy-makers.

468. The Summit concluded with the adoption of the Yokohama Declaration and the
Action Plan, 2019.

    African Union (AU) –European Union (EU)

469. The Commission co-organized, in close collaboration with the European
Commission, the First AU-EU Ministerial Follow Up Meeting which was held in
Brussels, Belgium on 21-22 January 2019, to advance the process of implementing
the outcomes of the 2017 Abidjan Summit, The Joint Communique of the 1st AU-EU
Ministerial considered progress on the Abidjan outcomes and charted the way forward
towards the 6th EU-AU Summit to be held in 2020 in Europe. The second ministerial
meeting will be held in Kigali. In parallel, the Commission engaged with the EU on the
finalization of the 5th AU-EU Summit Action Plan, which has also seen significant levels
of implementation based on the commitments made in Abidjan.

470. The EU elections have yielded an administration that is supportive of Africa-EU
relations, as expressed by the incoming President of the European Council, and the
President of the European Commission. The latter visited the AU Commission on 7
December 2019 as her first visit out of Brussels. She met with the Chairperson of the
Commission and pledged continued support to the AU-EU partnership.

471. In parallel, the Commission has been requested to provide technical assistance
to the African Group in charge of negotiating the Africa pillar under the post-Cotonou
agreement between the ACP and the European Union. This is with the view to
ensuring that Africa speaks with one voice in the different platform of its partnership
with the EU, in fulfilment of Decision Assembly/AU/Dec.715(XXXII) taken in Addis
Ababa in February 2019. To support the negotiating team, the Commission financed
and deployed four experts in the fields of (i) Capacity building and institutions; (ii)
Youth, Diaspora, Mobility and Migration; (iii) Governance, Peace and Security; and
(iv) Trade, investment, industrialization and services.


    Africa-Turkey

472. In line with the Communiqué of the Second Ministerial Review Conference of
the Africa-Turkey partnership, held on 12 February 2018, in Istanbul, Turkey, in which,
both sides committed to streamline efforts for the successful organization of the Third
Africa-Turkey Summit to be held in 2020 in Turkey, a delegation from the Commission
travelled to Ankara on 21 May 2019 for a meeting with the Turkish side to commence
discussions on preparation for the upcoming Summit. A proposal has been made by
Turkey that the Summit be held in the early second quarter of 2020.

    Africa-India Partnership

473. In preparation for the upcoming Fourth Africa-India Summit to be held in 2020,
the Commission participated in the mid-term Review Meeting of the Africa-India

                                                                      EX.CL/1214(XXXVI)
                                                                               Page 108

represented by the PRC Steering Committee led by the Chairperson of the PRC
Subcommittee of the Whole on Multilateral Cooperation. The Meeting evaluated the
status of implementation of projects agreed upon during the 3rd India-Africa Forum
Summit, which was held in 2015 and recognized the need for the Partnership to focus
on the multilateral aspects of cooperation based on the Agenda 2063. Furthermore,
the Meeting called for the early commencement of preparation for the 4th Africa-India
Forum Summit, which is scheduled to take place in 2020.

Institutional Partnerships

474. In 2019, the Commission forged new institutional partnerships with the
Governments of the United Kingdom, Russia, Norway as well as the World Bank and
the Eurasian Economic Commission. The Commission continued to manage existing
institutional partnerships such as with the United States of America, Germany and
France. According to findings of the evaluation of strategic partnerships, institutional
partnerships are meant to strengthen the ability of the Commission and other AU
organs to deliver on the goals of Agenda 2063 by benefiting from the comparative
advantage of each partner.

475. Norway: The Commission and Norway worked together to operationalize a
strategic agreement signed in December 2018 for cooperation in the areas of peace,
security and promotion of good governance. In October 2018, Norway established a
dedicated Norwegian delegation to the African Union in Addis Ababa. A high level
dialogue between Norway and the Commission is foreseen in 2020.

476. France: Following the signature of a cooperation MOU between the Foreign
Minister of France and the Chairperson of the Commission in June 2018, President
Emmanuel Macron visited the African Union on 13 March 2019, where it was agreed
to launch implementation of the MOU and announced the holding of the first session
of the high level dialogue, which was subsequently held with the Foreign Minister of
France in June 2019. The two sides applauded the historic entry in force of the
AfCFTA and France pledged to support it. Both agreed on the importance of
continuing to look for long-term predictable financing of peacekeeping operations
under AU and UN Security Council mandates. They stressed the importance of
continuing to coordinate their efforts on the multilateral issues of disarmament and
non-proliferation, the protection of human rights and criminal justice. France
expressed support to the role of the AU and African institutions in peace and security
on the Continent, and highlighted their role in maintaining multilateralism. It was judged
necessary to step up efforts to raise national contributions as part of the
implementation of the Paris Climate Agreement and to boost efforts to develop
renewables.

477. The strategic dialogue was followed by the Chairperson of the Commission ’
through his participation at the G7 Leaders’ Summit in Biarritz in August 2019, to which
issues of climate change were central, along with gender and promotion of equal
opportunity. France also pledged that the next France-Africa Summit in 2020 would
be dedicated to supporting AU efforts on promotion of sustainable cities.

478. United Kingdom: On 22 February 2019, a Memorandum of Understanding
with the United Kingdom’s Minister for Africa, where the two sides agreed to work
-----------------------Page 111 End-----------------------

                                                                      EX.CL/1214(XXXVI)
                                                                               Page 109

together in a number of concrete areas, namely (i) tackling the common challenges of
climate change; (ii) enhancing trade and investment links and investing in people
particularly to capitalize on Africa’s demographic dividend; (iii) strengthening resilience
through continued support to the African Union’s peace-making and peacekeeping
role. On migration and human mobility, the two sides recognized the added value of
the UN Global Compact on Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration and agreed to work
together to support initiatives that are aimed at preventing irregular migration and
opening up legal pathways. The two sides agreed to work together to promote and
protect an equitable and inclusive rules-based international system with the UN at its
core. The UK recognized and supported the AU’s desire to find African solutions for
African problems and the importance of the use of UN-assessed contributions for AU-
led Peace Support Operations authorized by the UN Security Council. The two sides
agreed to meet on an annual basis to assess progress with the partnership and to
discuss common priorities and challenges. The first High Level Dialogue is scheduled
to take place in 2020.

479. Germany: on 9 and 10 May 2019, the Commission with AUDA/NEPAD
engaged in a strategic dialogue with the German Foreign Office and the Federal
Ministry of Economic Cooperation and Development, where cooperation priorities for
the next two years were discussed against the backdrop of developments on the
Continent and in the world. The two sides agreed to cooperate in the areas of youth
and skills development; the African Governance Architecture, the operationalization of
the AU Innovation Lab jointly between the Commission and AUDA/NEPAD; the
AfCFTA; the implementation of the African Agenda on Land through the program
Strengthening capacities for Land Governance; and the establishment of a joint
financing mechanism to support the work of the Commission. Germany pledged up to
60 million euros for two years to support AU programmes in those areas.

480. Russia and the Eurasian Economic Union: On the margins of the Russia-
Africa Summit in Sochi in October 2019, a memorandum of understanding was signed
between the Chairperson of the Commission and the Russian Foreign Minister. The
MOU outlined areas of institutional cooperation, focused on promotion of economic
and political ties, multilateralism, science, technology and education, peace and
security, among other common priorities. At the same time, the Chairperson of the
Commission signed an MOU with the Chairman of the Board of the Eurasian Economic
Commission, aimed at promoting exchange of experience, mutual learning between
the two organizations and dialogue around issues of common concern.

481. United States: In line with the MoU between the Commission and the US
Department of State, signed in 2013, the Seventh High Level Dialogue (HLD) between
the Commission and the United States Government was held on 14-15 November
2019, in Washington, DC. The Dialogue opened up cooperation channels and bridged
gaps in views on peace, security and governance as well as trade and investment.
The two partners recognized Silencing the Guns as the AU theme of 2020, and
pledged to work together on empowering women, counterterrorism, counter-trafficking
and addressing transnational crime. The two sides also recognized the entry into force
of the AfCFTA as a game-changer in Africa, and welcomed recent U.S. initiatives to
promote trade and investment in Africa through the Prosper Act and the establishment
of the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation. They agreed on the
importance of mobilizing investments in projects that promote regional integration in

                                                                               Page 110

Africa. The Commission is expected to host the 8th High Level Dialogue, in Addis
Ababa, in the last quarter of 2020.

N.     AU REGIONAL OFFICES AND REPRESENTATIONAL
       MISSIONS
AU Permanent Mission in Brussels
482. During the period under review, the Permanent Mission in Brussels executed
the tasks contained in its activity program for the year 2019. These activities are mainly
focused on the following: (1) monitoring the implementation of the AU-EU partnership;
(2) follow up on the ACP-EU Post-Cotonou 2020 Negotiations (Africa Regional
Protocol); (3) Promoting continental integration Agenda; as well as (4) networking with
the African Diaspora and Civil society organizations in Europe.

483. The Brussels Office represented the Commission, in close collaboration with
the European Commission, to facilitate the organization and participated in the 1st AU-
EU ministerial meeting that took place in Brussels, Belgium, from 21 to 22 January
2019. To ensure that the recommendations of this meeting are effectively
implemented, a coordination/consultation mechanism with the Group of African
Ambassadors in Brussels has been establish, with the particular focus on migration
issues.

484. The Brussels Office also continued to monitor the negotiations of the ACP-EU
Post-Cotonou 2020 Negotiations, in particular the Africa Regional Protocol by
participating, as observer, in all the Group of Africa Caribbean Pacific (ACP) and ACP-
EU meetings relating to this process. It is also worth mentioning that the Commission
has launched the process of recruitment of consultants to provide technical support to
the Central Negotiating Group (CNG) for the Regional Protocol Africa as per the
request of the ACP Chief Negotiator and in line of the AU Decisions (November 2018,
January-February 2019) related to the Post-Cotonou 2020 negotiations. To date, four
independent consultants have been selected and will be deployed in due course to
provide technical assistance to the Africa – CNG.

485. During the period under review, the Brussels Office organized a sensitization
workshop on the AfCFTA on 12 June 2019 in Brussels. The workshop enabled
members of the Group of African Ambassadors in Brussels, the representatives of the
African Diaspora in Europe, as well as some of development partners of Africa based
in Belgium to be appraised on the AfCFTA Agreement, its opportunities and
challenges. At the end of this workshop, a number of recommendations were proposed
to enable the AU anticipate on potential difficulties related to the implementation of
this Agreement, including, inter alia, the need to finalize the negotiations on tariff
concessions taking into account the situation of vulnerable economies and least
developed countries (LDCs), the adoption of simple and transparent rules of origin,
the involvement of the African Diaspora, among other recommendations.

486. The Brussels Office organized a workshop with African diaspora and civil
society in Europe on AU Theme of the Year: ‘’Refugees, Returnees and Internally
Displaced Persons: Towards Durable Solutions to Forced Displacement in Africa’’.
-----------------------Page 113 End-----------------------

                                                                       EX.CL/1214(XXXVI)
                                                                                Page 111

The workshop was aimed at utilizing the unique position of the diaspora and civil
society on the Commission’s activities on the theme of the year and to discuss the
opportunities of involving them in strategic advocacy to address humanitarian
challenges sustainably as enshrined in Agenda 2063.

AU Permanent Mission to China

487. It will be recalled that the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC)
Johannesburg Summit Action Plan adopted in December 2015, indicated that “China
invites the African Union to establish a representative office in Beijing at an early date.”
The Commission has, since November 2018, operationalized the AU Permanent
Mission to China and a Permanent Representative was appointed. Subsequently, the
Mission to China was launched on the sidelines of the FOCAC Beijing Summit held in
September 2018.The primary mandate of the AU Permanent Mission in China is to
represent the AU in Beijing and to spearhead efforts to strengthen and consolidate the
AU-China relations in various fields of cooperation over the next three years, including
cooperation on political, peace and security; infrastructure development in Africa;
implementation of Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) in Africa, capitalizing on synergies
between the BRI and AU Agenda 2063 in relevant sectors as well as other relevant
ongoing programmes of mutual interest between the AU and China.

488. While the Permanent Mission in China is still in an early stage of its
operationalization, it has been very successful in several areas of its endeavours,
guided by its mandate in the country, notably, the following:

           i) It promoted the implementation of cooperation programmes between
                China and Africa, with particular focus on promotion and capitalization
                of synergies between FOCAC-the BRI and AU Agenda 2063 in relevant
                sectors;;
           ii) It facilitated contacts and exchange of cooperation programmes and
                projects between different China institutions/entities and AU specialized
                agencies, institutions, departments and delegations;
           iii) It provided regular updates to the Government of China, private sector,
                international partners on AU’s work in the continent through the
                dissemination of AU decisions, programmes and activities in various
                meetings. The activities undertaken have equally promoted AU’s
                presence and enhanced its visibility in the country, through site and field
                visits to various public and private Chinese institutions and events and
                diplomatic missions in the country as well as visiting delegations of the
                AU and Member States;
           iv) It coordinated with the African Group various efforts on the
                implementation of FOCAC outcomes and the AU Agenda 2063.

489. The Permanent Mission was made operational with the support of the
government of China through a grant of USD 1 million. The funds were used as
foundation for the establishment of the Beijing Office. The Mission, being a new Office,
is operating under quite difficult and demanding conditions on the ground with two
professionals – Political and Peace and Security and Finance and Administration
Officers, with four local staffs. The grant of China enabled to cover operational
expenses, notably the Office rental, construction of conference facilities and other
-----------------------Page 114 End-----------------------

                                                                      EX.CL/1214(XXXVI)
                                                                               Page 112

office requirements.

490. Despite the progress, a number of challenges need to be addressed in the
future especially by providing the Mission with an approved structure and to recruit to
the positions thus created as a priority. The urgent need to engage the Chinese side
to clear the Host Agreement for its early finalization and signature.

AU Permanent Delegation in Geneva

491. During the year under review, the Permanent Delegation in Geneva pursued its
effort to support the African Group in Geneva and coordinate AU involvement in the
WTO and other fora. In 2019, the Geneva Office focused on three priority areas,
namely: human rights and humanitarian issues; trade matters; and African candidature
and leadership in international systems.

492. In March 2019, the Commission attended the High Level Segment of the
Human Rights represented by Chairperson, Moussa Faki Mahamat, who emphasized
the need for Africans to be able to address all the challenges of Human Rights
themselves. This is taking into consideration that Africa has its own credible
mechanisms to deal with them.

493. In the same vein, the issue of migration has been addressed. In line with the
2019 Theme “Year of Refugees, Returnees and Internally Displaced Persons:
Towards Durable Solutions for Forced Displacement in Africa”, the Geneva Office
undertook various activities to popularize that Theme and collect a wide-range of
contributions from all concerned stakeholders.

494. During 2019, the Geneva Office continued to tackle the issue of AU having no
status at the World Trade Organization (WTO), issue which is still pending since the
1990s. Currently, the situation is more compelling for the AU to have such a status
due to its importance in facilitating full operationalization of AfCFTA that is to promote
inter-African trade. The Geneva Office is continually engaging the African Group of
Ambassadors in Geneva to use the opportunity of the WTO’s Twelfth Ministerial
Conference to be held in 2020 and all other upcoming venues to push for the
attainment of the status. After all, the Doha Development Agenda considers that rules
on new issues to govern international trade are premature.

495. Equally, the 15th Quadrennial Conference of the United Nations Conference on
Trade and Development (UNCTAD XV) will take place in October 2020. UNCTAD XV
should highlight the need for international cooperation to be heightened rather than
decreased; and for UNCTAD to continue its mandate to provide developing countries
and other Member States with policy-relevant research, analysis, recommendations
and other activities regarding trade and development and the interlinkages that these
have to broader systemic issues such as finance, debt, investment, and taxation. The
outcome document should reiterate the commitment of the Member States to
strengthen UNCTAD as the focal point within the United Nations system for the
integrated treatment of trade and development and interrelated issues in the areas of
finance, technology, investment and sustainable development.

496.   Given the importance of African leadership in the UN and international system
-----------------------Page 115 End-----------------------

                                                                     EX.CL/1214(XXXVI)
                                                                              Page 113

in ensuring that the reality of the continental context and specificities are well
articulated and addressed, the Geneva Office sustained its efforts to implement
relevant policy organs decisions on the matter. In the September 2019 elections for
members of the Committee against Torture, it was noted that Africa had endorsed only
one candidate, while the continent could have increased its chances by having more
candidates. In this regard, it is important for Member States to continue speaking with
one voice at international fora with the support of the Commission.

497. As Africa prepares for the upcoming elections of the Deputy Director General
(DDG) of the International Organization for Migration (IOM) and Director General of
ILO to be conducted in 2020 and 2021, respectively, the Geneva Office will continue
to advocate AU’s endorsed candidates. The solidarity shown by Member States during
the election of Director General of the WHO was exemplary and should be emulated
during the upcoming elections.

AU Observer Mission to the United Nations
498. In keeping to its mandate of developing and maintaining constructive and
productive institutional relationships between the African Union and the United Nations
institutions as well as to promote a common African view/position within the African
Group in Multilateral negotiations, the Mission continued to provide strategic guidance
and direction to the Commission for enhancing strategic partnership with the United
Nations. The Mission ensured the effective monitoring and implementation of AU
Decisions within the UN system as well as building on the key pillars of the Au Strategic
Plan in these interactions, both at UNGA, UNSC and other relevant Organs in all areas
of AU stake and interests.

499. The Mission continued to coordinate and support the activities of the African
Group, through the convening of weekly meetings of the Group (at least 2 meetings
per week), advising on strategies for a more effective presence and impact of the
African Group within the UN system. The Office also facilitated the planning and
organization of the Annual Retreat of African Permanent Representatives which
included over 80 participants including senior officials of the United Nations.

500. The Mission also provided technical support to the African Group Candidatures
Committee and facilitated the participation of the Chairs of the African Group and the
Candidatures Committee at the AU Summit held in Niamey, Niger in accordance with
the Executive Council Decision.

501. On the issue of Security Council reform, the Mission continued to closely
monitor the ongoing intergovernmental negotiations in the General Assembly on
various clusters of UN Security Council Reform, in accordance with resolution 62/557
of 15 September 2008. Pursuant to all AU Assembly decisions on United Nation
reform, the Mission continued to coordinate the activities of the AU Permanent
Representatives of the Committee of Ten (C-10) in New York on UN Reform, working
in consultation with the African Group, through the articulation of the Ezulwini
Consensus and Sirte Declaration.

502. In the area of Peace and Security, the Mission continued to leverage the Joint
AU-UN Framework for Enhanced Strategic Partnership in the area of Peace and
-----------------------Page 116 End-----------------------

                                                                      EX.CL/1214(XXXVI)
                                                                               Page 114

Security to optimize the impact of AU decisions within the UN Security Council and
maintained constant consultations with African Members of the UN Security Council
(A3) on African issues as well as regular participation in the work of the UNSC by
maintaining regular participation in UNSC sessions on these matters. The A3 played
a significant role in the adoption of UNSC Resolution 2457 on the AU’s Silencing the
Guns initiative. While the AU’s leadership role was upheld by the UNSC on the issue
of Sudan, it continues to deny the AU a role over the Libyan crisis as was evidenced
during the 13th annual consultations held between the AUPSC and the UNSC, in
Addis-Ababa, Ethiopia on 21-22 October 2019. With regard to the issue of financing
of AU-led Peace Support Operations (AUPSOs), building on previous resolutions
adopted by the UNSC, in particular 2320 (2016) and 2378 (2017), the A3 has been
proactive in keeping this issue on the agenda of the UNSC-AUPC. However, it is
imperative that, the forthcoming Assembly of the Union in February 2020 provides
clear guidance on this issue. The Mission plans to enhance its support to the A3,
including support to Niger and Tunisia, the two incoming members, to better prepare
their membership of the UNSC. To promote continuity between the new and outgoing
African Members of the UNSC, the Mission will convene an experience sharing and
best practices workshop in early January 2020.

503. With respect to AU’s efforts to implement its PCRD Policy within the context of
Agenda 2063, the Mission scaled up its engagements with the African Coordination
Mechanism of the Peace Building Commission (PBC). The Mission organized a retreat
for the African Coordination Mechanism of the PBC, the African Member States in the
UN Security Council (A3), the Women, Peace and Security focal points on PBC to
deliberate on how the African Member States would prepare for and contribute to the
2020 Review of the Peacebuilding Architecture. The retreat, as well as a subsequent
lesson learned meeting with African countries that have benefited from PBC support,
agreed on the need to articulate an “African Position Paper” on the 2020 Review of
the UN Peacebuilding Architecture. The “Position Paper,” which will be submitted to
the AU-PSC for endorsement, would guide Africa’s engagement during the
intergovernmental process.

504. On Economic and Social matters, the Mission continued to proactively engage
with key stakeholders, particularly the Africa Group and development partners to
promote, at all levels, a proper appreciation of Agenda 2063 vis-à-vis the 2030 Agenda
and the Sustainable Development Goals. Efforts were increased to mobilize support
for the implementation of Agenda 2063 as well as advocating the important role of
Official Development Assistance (ODA) in the attainment of its goals and the SDGs.
In 2019, the Mission championed a number of strategic collaborations in enhancing
socio-economic developments on the continent, through: i) The African Dialogue
Series (ADS) 2019; ii) A high-Level Event on Illicit Financial Flows (IFFs); and; iii) The
Africa Day, which served as a platform for African countries to present their Voluntary
National Reviews (VNRs).

505. Following the launch of the 100,000 SME’s for 1 Million Jobs by 2021 Campaign
It was recognized that SME finance is pivotal to the success of the Agency’s approach,
by building the business skills set of young SME’s to enhance their formal business
approaches in order to increase their access to finance.

506.   On Social Development, the Mission supported the annual meeting of the
-----------------------Page 117 End-----------------------

                                                                      EX.CL/1214(XXXVI)
                                                                               Page 115

Commission for Social Development which took place in February 2019 under the
Chairmanship of Senegal. The meeting deliberated on the priority theme for the year
“Addressing inequalities and challenges to social inclusion through fiscal, wage and
social protection policies”. Among other things, it encourages Governments to combat
discrimination and social exclusion; promote affordable and equitable access to basic
services; use sound public spending policies to ensure universal health care; ensure
active labour policies to provide decent work for all and a fair share of productivity for
workers; and expand social protection to all people, despite limited fiscal resources.

507. The Mission monitored the 63rd session of the Commission on the Status of
Women that was held in March 2019 under the theme “Social protection systems,
access to public services and sustainable infrastructure for gender equality and the
empowerment of women and girls.” The session urged Governments, the United
Nations system, international and regional organizations, to strengthen normative,
legal and policy frameworks so that women and girls can fully and equally enjoy their
human rights and fundamental freedoms.

508. On communication, the Mission has been working on creating and enhancing
the visibility of the AU within the United Nations. This objective has been achieved
digitally through social media. However, there is a need to move from digital
communications to outreach. Therefore, the Communications Team will continue to
enhance the visibility of the Mission through increased partnerships, media relations
and other initiatives that will contribute to spread the message of the African Union. In
a bid to enhance the Office’s reach, in partnership with UN Global Communications,
the Mission will produce the first edition of its Yearbook for January 2020. This
publication will provide a summary of the key activities of the Mission with the aim of
highlighting the leadership of the African Union in its various fields of activity, while
welcoming the enhanced AU-UN partnership.

509. The activities of the African Group continue to be accorded high priority with a
view to enhancing Africa’s influence and impact at the United Nations. These efforts
have resulted in a more cohesive and unified African approach in dealing with global
issues and speaking with one voice around a Common African Position. As a result,
Africa’s leadership was at the helm of the 74th Session of the United Nations General
Assembly (UNGA) bodes well for the continent in terms of its leadership in promoting
and advancing Africa’s interests and priorities at the United Nations. The close
alignment of the priorities of the President of the General Assembly with those of
Africa, most notably in Education, Gender Equality and Women Empowerment,
Sustaining Peace, Financing for Development and Partnership is encouraging. The
Mission will continue to support the African Group to leverage its collective political
weight to shape the African narratives as well as promote and defend Africa’s interest.
In this vein, there is a strong imperative for a renewed commitment to the ideals and
principles of the United Nations Charter, reaffirmation of the true value of
multilateralism and the centrality of the United Nations in addressing global
challenges. The commemoration of the 75th Anniversary of the United Nations offers
a unique opportunity to do so. Needless to say, in the changing global context where
multilateralism continues to be under threat, the role of partnerships has gained
prominence. In this respect, the fact that the African Group is entering into strategic
partnerships with both the Nordic Countries and CARICOM is a welcome
development.

                                                                      EX.CL/1214(XXXVI)
                                                                               Page 116


510. The partnership between the African Union and the United Nations has made
significant progress with remarkable progress between the AU-PSC and UNSC, the
Commission and the Secretariat as well as in the field. The two institutions are
increasingly leveraging their comparative strengths to complement each other. The
African Group has demonstrated strong commitment in ensuring close alignment of
Africa’s Agenda 2063 with the 2030 Global Agenda. Translating these aspirations into
tangible results on the ground, at regional and national levels remains a serious
challenge which can only be overcome through better coherence and coordination.

511. Among the challenges that the Office is confronted with, the following can be
cited:

     i)    Renovation of the old premises (354 e 50th street): The Office has submitted
           the requisite proposals from three companies bidding for the contract to
           renovate the premises. Meanwhile, the neighbours around the premises
           have been lodging complaints about the condition of the building and its
           adverse effects on the value of the properties in the areas. A decision of the
           relevant policy organs is awaited. The Commission is yet to take a decision
           on this longstanding issue;
     ii)   Renovations of the conference room not yet completed due to some missing
           facilities, which make consultations with African Group and A3 members
           difficult;
    iii)   The perennial issue of diplomatic status of the Mission, in spite of several
           attempts towards the US Government which are yet to produce results. The
           issue should be taken up within the AUC-USA institutional partnership;
    iv)    The unresolved issue of the status of the Observer status of the AU Mission
           represents a huge impediment to its ability to effectively project global voice
           and representation. It poses obstacles to its effective participation in the
           deliberations of the UN as it does not have access to meetings of an
           important organ such as the G-77 and China. In the same vein, because of
           its observer status, speaking slots accorded to it are generally not
           favourable.

AU Representational Mission to the United States – Washington D.C.
Office
512. Promoting and reinforcing the bilateral relations between the African Union and
the United States of America has been, in 2019, at the centre of the AU
Representational Mission’s engagement and advocacy efforts with the U.S
Administration, both at the level houses of Congress and the think tank community.
The Mission has played a key role in the promotion of Africa’s interests and priorities,
raising the profile and visibility of the AU in the U.S. and mobilizing the support of key
stakeholders and the Diaspora for regional and continental initiatives in conformity with
its core mandate.

513. The year 2019 witnessed a particular strengthening of the AU’s relations with
the U.S in the areas of women economic empowerment, as well as the support for
development of the AfCFTA. The signature by the Deputy Chairperson of the
Commission, Kwesi Quartey and the Advisor to the U.S President Ms. Ivanka Trump,
on 15 April 2019 of a joint communique committing to a partnership to advance
women’s economic empowerment and entrepreneurship across the continent is an
-----------------------Page 119 End-----------------------

                                                                     EX.CL/1214(XXXVI)
                                                                              Page 117

important milestone in the bilateral relationship. Similarly, the signing of a joint
statement by the Commissioner for Trade and Industry and Ambassador C. J
Mahoney, Deputy US. Trade Representative concerning the development of the
AfCFTA on 5 August 2019 reflected the shared goals to deepen cooperation on trade
and investment.

514. The Mission used various diplomatic opportunities to engage a strategic
dialogue with the U.S stakeholders on how the new initiatives launched by the current
U.S Administration such as the US Development Finance Corporation and Prosper
Africa can integrate the continental and regional dimensions in their development
paradigm by providing support for Africa’s transformative vision under Agenda 2063.

515. The Mission facilitated and supported the Commission’s Delegation at the 7th
Edition of the High-Level Dialogue of the African Union Commission- the United States
of America took place in Washington, DC held on 15 November 2019.

516. Building on the strong bipartisan and bicameral support within both Houses of
the U.S Congress that Africa enjoys, the AU Representational Mission spared no effort
in 2019 to raise to mobilize support for AU’s strategic priorities. A particular emphasis
was put on the implementation of the AfCFTA), as well as the financing of the AU
peace support operations. In this regard, a high level visit comprised of the three
African Members of the United Nations Security Council (A3) at the level of
Ambassadors (South Africa, Equatorial Guinee and Cote d’Ivoire) was organized from
July 15 to 17 2019 by the AU Washington Office in coordination with AU Permanent
Observer Mission to the United Nations. The objective of the visit was to secure the
support of various US stakeholders, in particular the legislative branch of the US
government, with regard to the A3 proposed Security Council resolution pertaining to
the financing of African Union-led Peace Support Operations.

517. The high-level meeting with the chairmen of Foreign Affairs, Foreign Relations
and Appropriations committees in the House of Representatives and the Senate
reflected the importance of the relationship and the capital of sympathy that members
of Congress, including the members of the Congressional Black Caucus have towards
Africa and the African Union

518. It is worth mentioning that the Mission, which coordinates the monthly meetings
of the African Diplomatic Corps, serves as the Secretariat of the Group and hosts the
Group meetings as well as of its Committees in charge of U.S. - Africa Strategic
Relations, Economic Development, Human and Sustainable Development and Public
Affairs.

519. Working with the AU Commission’s Department of Trade and Industry and the
African AGOA Eligible Countries, the Office organized the AGOA Mid-Term Review in
Washington, DC, from 12 to 13 June 2019 as key milestone in the preparation of the
AGOA Forum that took place in Abidjan, Cote d’Ivoire from 4 to 6 August 2019 under
the theme of “AGOA and the future: Developing a New Trade Paradigm to Guide U.S-
Africa Trade and Investment”.

520. In line of the Assembly’s decision of February 2019 in Addis Ababa, pertaining
to the recognition of the 400th Anniversary of the Transatlantic Slave Trade, the
-----------------------Page 120 End-----------------------

                                                                    EX.CL/1214(XXXVI)
                                                                             Page 118

Mission has played a leadership role in mobilizing the key stakeholders in the US,
particularly the African Diplomatic Corps and Diaspora; and provided every assistance
in order to ensure the effective implementation of this decision.

521. In this regard, the R 400 Summit was organized in Charlotte, North Carolina
from 27 to 29 September, 2019, under the leadership of the founder of the R 400
Movement Bishop Alexander to inaugurate a vision and a movement that Reconnects,
Reconciles, Reclaims and Rebuilds a thriving Pan-African future for the next 400
years. As stipulated in that Summit Decision, the R400 Conference launched the
concept of the Park International Trade Hub, which aims at connecting businesses
and African and African-American business leaders in different sectors from Africa and
the United States to deliver business partnership.

O.     COMMUNICATION AND OUTREACH
522. During the period under review, the Commission continued its efforts to
increase the visibility of the AU through communication activities in both mainstream
media as well as online and digital platforms.

a. Building the AU Brand Identity

523. Following the development of the first ever Brand Identity Style and
Communication Guide for the AU, which serves as the reference point for all
communication and visibility material for the AU and its organs to ensure uniformity in
expression of the AU brand and creating one strong, the Commission initiated work
on updating its iconography on communication material and digital platforms as well
as realigning the AU Organs with the AU corporate brand identity.

524. New brand identities and websites for AU institutions were undertaken to align
with the AU corporate brand with the African Energy Commission (AFREC), African
Committee of Experts on the Rights and Welfare of the Child (ACERWC) being
completed and work ongoing to enhance the branding and visibility for the AUDA--
NEPAD, PAP,, PAU and the AU Advisory Board on Corruption.

b. Enhanced Use of Technology and Digital/Social Media Communication

525. A new AU website was launched in April 2019, with an improved user interface
and content. Combined with activities redirected from social media platforms the new
AU website saw an increase in visitors with over three (3) million page views registered
during this period. In 2019, the Commission reached out to more people on social
media platforms as compared to 2018, increasing followers on both Twitter (+21%)
and Facebook (+7%). AU activities and programmes were promoted on Facebook to
popularise and educate African citizens on the mandates of the Union. The following
activities were promoted: AU Theme of the Year 2019, AU Commemorative Days,
Agenda 2063 Aspirations and Flagship Projects, 1 Million by 2021, AU Anthems (in
Swahili, English, French, Arabic, Portuguese and Spanish), AU Summits and
meetings garnering 54.8 million impressions

c. Popularisation of Agenda 2063
-----------------------Page 121 End-----------------------

                                                                     EX.CL/1214(XXXVI)
                                                                              Page 119

526. Following the production of four Documentaries profiling Agenda 2063 Flagship
projects, namely: Silencing the Guns, AfCFTA, Commodities Strategy and
Infrastructure and Energy focusing on PIDA and Grand Inga Dam, a number of
promotional activities were undertaken as follows:

     i) Airing the films on various regional TV networks, through the MOU signed
          with Africa 24 TV Network, the only African owned news channel and
          broadcasting in over twenty-five (25) African countries as well as in Europe,
          Middle East and North America (through broadcast partners), to over 80
          million viewers;
     ii) The films were also promoted on Video sharing platforms (YouTube) and
          Social media (Facebook and Twitter);
     iii) Advertorials were run in regional and continental publications (combined
          readership of 4.1million readers as well as inflight magazines for major
          African airlines reaching combined annual travellers of 18.5miillion).

527. The Commission also engaged with African Media on Agenda 2063 through
the Annual meeting of the Pan-African Network of Agenda 2063 Journalists, which
was held in Johannesburg, South Africa. The network brought together journalist from
across the continent to discuss key issues affecting Africa’s development agenda and
how to promote Agenda 2063, the work of the AU and to give importance to Africa’s
voices in telling Africa’s story and sharing ideas on how Africa’s media can better build
the narrative of the continent.

528. In line with the decision from the STC-CICT 2017 for the AU to recognise the
contributions of journalists towards the achievement of Aspiration 6 of Agenda 2063
and institutionalise the Pan-African Media Awards on Gender Equality and Women’s
Empowerment, the Commission has made efforts to identify contributions of
journalists who give attention to development issues towards the achievement of
Agenda 2063 in the process of institutionalizing the Pan-African Media Awards on
Promoting Agenda 2063. In this regard and during the annual African Women in Media
(AWiM) Conference in July 2019, 5 journalists were awarded in the areas of:- African
Continental Free Trade Area; Silencing the Guns by 2020; African Passport and Free
Movement of People; Free Trade and Migration; Women and Free Trade to promote
Agenda 2063.

d. AU Studio

architectural design and layout of the new AU Studio, which will be installed in the New
Conference Centre at AU Headquarters in 2020.

e. Africa Fact-book Project

530. The Africa Fact-book project is an initiative undertaken under Agenda 2063

           internationally recognised scholars of African history and 5 editors of
           international news organisations in Africa.

f. 2019 AU Publications

531. AU Echo 2019 Edition - Centred on the 2019 Theme of the Year and key

                                                                             Page 121

P.     CONCLUSION AND THE WAY FORWARD FOR 2020
536. This Report on the Activities of the Union and its Organs highlights some of the
significant achievements the Union made in 2019 and for which the continent can take
a legitimate pride. These achievements are a tangible demonstration of the impact of
the Union’s transformative agenda and its contribution to improving the livelihoods for
African citizens. Their reinforcement and the need for a better outreach to make them
known to African citizens will continue to engage the attention of the Commission,
other Organs and Specialized Agencies in 2020.

537. Many challenges still persist. Conflicts and violence remain a reality that affects
the lives of large segments of the African population. The democratization process
and the promotion of good governance are still fraught with difficulties. Poverty and
misery are the daily lot of hundreds of millions of people even though the continent is
endowed with wealth and talent. The voice of Africa on the international stage is still
insufficiently taken into account, even though the continent represents more than a
quarter of the membership of the United Nations.

538. With Agenda 2063, Africa through the Union has developed a roadmap that
clearly articulates the path forward for its transformation. The year 2019 offers the
opportunity to move faster to break the multiple chains that hinder the actualization of
Africa's rich human and natural potential. From this point of view, nothing is more
decisive than the deepening of continental unity. As the Chairperson of the
Commission has pointed out many times, “With unity we are everything. Without it, we
are nothing”.
