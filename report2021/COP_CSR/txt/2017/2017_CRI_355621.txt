Water management in Reserva Conchal in this period has posed a huge challenge for the organization. The weather phenomenon “El Niño” affecting the North Pacific area of the country where the project is located has reduced the area’s rainfall in the last three years, affecting the recharge of local aquifers and reducing water availability. Reserva Conchal has adapted its processes and activities, as well as reinforced consumption control to adjust to the current availability and ensure the operation’s continuity and sustainability. Water consumption of Reserva Conchal in its areas of operation, hotels (The Westin Golf Resort & Spa Playa Conchal), residential condominiums and golf course accounted for 8.37 million hectoliters of water, of which 47% is used for human consumption NUESTRA GENTE and the remaining 53% for irrigation. It should be noted that in the irrigation of the golf course INVERSIÓN SOCIAL water reuse is incorporated as described in detail below. ENVIRONMENTAL An important advance of this period is that Desalination plant in Reserva Conchal DIMENSION Reserva Conchal has the permits for the construction and installation of a seawater INDICADORES GRI desalination plant (3 modules of 500 m3 per day each), which starts operations at the end of 2016 to supply potable water to the project.

For this year, the reported carbon footprint was 2593.98 tons of CO2e, 978 tons of CO2 more than in 2015 due to the increase in the rate of leakage of refrigerant gases from the final product cold storage equipment. Reductions were made through the installation of solar NUESTRA GENTE panels.

The Beer, Tropical, Pepsi plants and the Regional Distribution Center of Guápiles are adjacent to surface water bodies and the Costa Rican Forestry Law establishes as protected area the boundary margin with the water body from the river bank, 10 m into the property in rural areas (the three Production Plants) and 15m in the Guápiles RDC for being located in rural area; however, these areas are not considered of high biodiversity. NUESTRA GENTE The Reserva Conchal project is located adjacent to the maritime-terrestrial zone, mangrove and INVERSIÓN SOCIAL the mangrove lagoon; however, and as in the previous case, they are not considered areas of high biodiversity. In spite of the above, the real ENVIRONMENTAL estate project develops different initiatives for DIMENSION the protection of diverse zones both outside and within its property for the protection of INDICADORES GRI biodiversity. No significant direct impact on biodiversity is reported in protected natural areas or in unprotected high biodiversity areas, derived from FIFCO activities, products and services in protected areas and in areas of high biodiversity value in zones outside the protected areas. In an indirect way, the improper handling of postconsumer containers by the consumers causes FIFCO’s | 2016 Integrated Report 178 BIODIVERSITY them to reach surface water bodies (rivers and seas) which can affect biodiversity; however and to mitigate this impact, is that FIFCO has its own Recycling Program. FIFCO protects habitats both within its properties and in extensions of land outside it. In the case of the Beer Plant and Tropical Plant, these allocate a percentage of their area for the protection of their water sources, which has a positive impact on the area’s biodiversity. For its part, Reserva Conchal allocates 60% of the property for private reserve, currently under natural regeneration. Externally, FIFCO, aware of the importance of natural resources, especially forest coverage in protecting biodiversity but also water resources, scenic beauty and carbon fixation, has invested since the year 2001 in the protection of watersheds through environmental service certificates.

(FIFCO) con el fin de llevar a cabo la verificación externa de los procesos de materialidad y participación de las partes interesadas del Reporte Integrado 2016 de FIFCO, correspondiente, al periodo vigente entre el 01 de octubre de 2015 al 30 de septiembre de 2016. Alcance y Objetivo Los objetivos específicos del proyecto fueron: 1. Verificar los procesos claves de la elaboración del reporte, como el análisis de materialidad y la participación de las partes interesadas. 2. Llevar a cabo una lectura crítica del Reporte Integrado 2016, para apoyar a FIFCO en el aseguramiento de la calidad del reporte según las metodologías del IIRC (International Integrated Reporting Council) y GRI (Global Reporting Initiative) bajo la opción en concordancia “exhaustiva”. 3. Identificar las oportunidades de mejora para el próximo Reporte Integrado. Igualmente, dicho análisis busca identificar tanto las oportunidades de mejora en la gestión como la integración de los ámbitos de sostenibilidad en la empresa. Nuestro trabajo no contempló el análisis y verificación de datos cuantitativos en el reporte, sean éstos datos financieros, sociales o ambientales. Metodología y Procesos Realizamos las siguientes actividades para el proceso de verificación: • Revisión del reporte integrado, específicamente lo que respecta a los contenidos reportados para los disclosures GRI 102-­‐40; GRI 102-­‐42 a GRI 102-­‐49; GRI 103-­‐1; cotejando nivel de cumplimiento con los requisitos de los GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards 2016 (publicado el 19 de octubre de 2016), los principios de materialidad y participación de las partes interesadas, incluyendo nivel de coherencia en razón de los resultados de las entrevistas y análisis de información secundaria. • Presentación de los resultados de la verificación y las oportunidades de mejora a los directores y NUESTRA GENTE ejecutivos de FIFCO. Conclusiones FIFCO mantuvo las mismas matrices de materialidad de 2015 para cada Unidad de Negocio en Costa Rica y INVERSIÓN SOCIAL Guatemala, y durante 2016 desarrolló el proceso de materialidad del North American Breweries. De esta manera FIFCO tiene identificado los temas más relevantes con base a la realidad y negocio de cada Unidad. DIMENSIÓN AMBIENTAL FIFCO ha comprometido formalmente con los Objetivos de Desarrollo Sostenible (ODS) y por primera vez en su Reporte Integrado 2016 se muestra cómo se ha incorporado los ODS en su estrategia a través de una valoración inicial de los impactos positivos y negativos que sus operaciones tienen en cada uno de los 17 Objetivos. GRI DISCLOSURES Cabe señalar que el tercero Reporte Integrado de FIFCO ha mejorado sustancialmente la incorporación de AND ANNEXES conceptos fundamentales de la metodología de IIRC como “los capitales” y la creación de valor en el corto, mediano y largo plazo. Se muestra un análisis del contexto, insumos, actividades y resultados relacionados con cada uno de los seis capitales. Esto muestra cómo la empresa está creando valor en todas las unidades de negocio y su compromiso de la empresa en seguir avanzando en una gestión de triple utilidad.
